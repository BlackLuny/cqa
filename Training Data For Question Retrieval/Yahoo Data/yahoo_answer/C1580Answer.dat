es6Xw606aa	Hamas and Isreal would of course have us believe each one of them are the original inhabitants of Palestine. Of course as in all such things, the truth is never as cut and dried. Isreal was 'created' in 1949 but Jews have been living there for centuries. So have Arabs - actually there are all by ethnic root arab - whether they are jews, christains or muslims. The Arab identity has been hijacked by all the arab muslim countries but I know several Jews and christains who are proud to cal themselves Arab.   So you see if Palestine belongs to all Arabs then naturally it belongs to Arab Jews as well. Initally of course the Jews who came from outside were settlers but now they have had children there and their roots I guess are in Isreal too.  I am a non-religious muslim and I do believe that this issue of the 2000 year old prophecy and the promised land is a bit of hooey and just a great excuse for land grabbing.   Isreal is claiming the whole piece of land for the jews which is unfair on the Arab muslims and christains. Also its all ok to say they turned the desert into a booming economy but this is essentially a myth which has been fed to Isreali school children and plus if you take over someone's house and say ok you cant stay here but i shall make it beautiful - big deal!  Where Isreal is going wrong is that they are making the same mistake that Gerany made with them -they wanted to ethnically cleanse jews and now these imported jews want to ethnically cleanse native arab muslims and christains. On what authority? There is no moral and religious sanction for this and I am surprised Jews who have suffered so much in the holocaust are doing the exact same to others and feel they are justififed, This is wrong wrong wrong. If isreal can be a fair country with equal rights to all that live there then i say give them all of palestine and may they have peace with it!|`|MjGgICRiaa	LOL! So I guess Palestinians are Jews then? Because Jerusalem was created BY Jews as the Capital of ancient Israel over 3000 years ago.|`|8I9uduIiaa	The term 'Palestinian' always used to refer to Jews.    The Palestinian Post newspaper - staffed by Jews, became the Jerusalem Post.    The Palestinian Philharmonic Orchestra - again, 100% Jewish.    For over 3000 years, Palestinian Jews have been living in that region. It used to be  called Judea, until the Romans conquered it and renamed it 'palestina' after the already long gone Philistines.    If the Arabs had not rejected the rights of the Palestinian Jews to a tiny state in the region, then today there would be a Palestinian Arab state  beside Israel. Instead, the Arab world declared war and attacked Israel.    Jews are the only people, the ONLY people, who have returned over and over and over to this region, and who have ruled over it democratically.  It was Jews that irrigated the land and turned sand dunes into cities like Tel Aviv.    Non Jews live in Israel as citizens and are on an equal footing in all ways with Jews.    Do you also question the right of Muslims to claim 22 Muslim nations as their own?    http://www.honestreporting.com|`|t58rc9tCaa	While we are on the nonsensical subject of equating the ancient Canaanites (who were racially absorbed by the Israelites after their conquest) with the modern Arab Palestinians, we cannot help but note the irony that according to the Qur'an, Moses was commanded by Allah to take the Children of Israel and conquer Canaan:    "To Moses We [Allah] gave nine clear signs. Ask the Israelites how he [Moses] first appeared amongst them. Pharoah said to him: 'Moses, I can see that you are bewitched.' 'You know full well,' he [Moses] replied, 'that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has revealed these visible signs. Pharoah, you are doomed.'"    "Pharoah sought to scare them [the Israelites] out of the land [of Israel]: but We [Allah] drowned him [Pharoah] together with all who were with him. Then We [Allah] said to the Israelites: 'Dwell in this land [the Land of Israel]. When the promise of the hereafter [End of Days] comes to be fulfilled, We [Allah] shall assemble you [the Israelites] all together [in the Land of Israel]."    "We [Allah] have revealed the Qur'an with the truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have sent you [Muhammed] forth only to proclaim good news and to give warning."    [Qur'an, "Night Journey," chapter 17:100-104]    "Say: 'O God, King of the kingdom (1), Thou givest the kingdom to whom Thou pleasest, and Thou strippest off the kingdom from whom Thou pleasest; Thou endowest with honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: all the best is in Thy hand. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.'" [Qur'an 3:26]    "And [remember] when Moses said to his people: 'O my people, call in remembrance the favour of God unto you, when he produced prophets among you, made you kings, and gave to you what He had not given to any other among the peoples. O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin.'" [Qur'an 5:20-21]|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Arabs who have lived there never cared for the land & caused it to flourish as it is today. The people of Israel have developed sophisticated irrigation techniques which allow them to farm & grow produce, as well as to repopulate the land with trees. Trees were cut down by those who pillaged the land & conquered it.  I would say that those who love the land & have worked the land & established a profitable economy are the ones who have a right to it. That just happens to be Israel. As Scripture predicted, Israel has again bloomed & rejoiced.|`|Fb519XJgaa	Historically, there were 2 Jewish Kingdoms. One in North East called Israel and one in the South East called Judea. True  Now Jerusalem was Part of Judea not Israel. True  Contemporary, Jerusalem was never part of the new state of Israel, which was created in 1948.  Now there is no single country in the world is willing to recognize that Jerusalem is part of Israel. True.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Every one who was born there.    A travel guide to Palestine and Syria, published in 1906 by Karl Baedeker, illustrates the fact that, even when the Islamic Ottoman Empire ruled the region, the Muslim population in Jerusalem was minimal. The book estimates the total population of the city at 60,000, of whom 7,000 were Muslims, 13,000 were Christians and 40,000 were Jews.    Even though the Jews were persecuted, still they came to Jerusalem and represented the overwhelming majority of the population as early as 1906. And even though Muslims today claim Jerusalem as the third holiest site in Islam, when the city was under Islamic rule, they had little interest in it. As the Jews came, drained the swamps and made the deserts bloom, something interesting began to happen. Arabs followed. I don't blame them. They had good reason to come. They came for jobs. They came for prosperity. They came for freedom. And they came in large numbers.    Today, Israel has the highest concentration of Arab terrorists. From humanitarian concerns, it would be best for all parties concerned to disburse this Arab population, so they can assimilate into Western culture that EXPECTS them to assimilate and won't appease them. A recent study shows 1/3 would like to emigrate outside of Gaza and West Bank into Western societies. So let them go.      .      .|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	Ever since King David made Jerusalem the capital of Israel more than 3,000 years ago, the city has played a central role in Jewish existence. The Western Wall in the Old City  the last remaining wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, the holiest site in Judaism  is the object of Jewish veneration and the focus of Jewish prayer. Three times a day, for thousands of years, Jews have prayed "To Jerusalem, thy city, shall we return with joy," and have repeated the Psalmist's oath: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning."    Jerusalem "has known only two periods of true greatness, and these have been separated by 2,000 years. Greatness has only happened under Jewish rule," Leon and Jill Uris wrote in Jerusalem. "This is so because the Jews have loved her the most, and have remained constant in that love throughout the centuries of their dispersion....It is the longest, deepest love affair in history."       For three thousand years, Jerusalem has been the center of Jewish hope and longing. No other city has played such a dominant role in the history, culture, religion and consciousness of a people as has Jerusalem in the life of Jewry and Judaism. Throughout centuries of exile, Jerusalem remained alive in the hearts of Jews everywhere as the focal point of Jewish history, the symbol of ancient glory, spiritual fulfillment and modern renewal. This heart and soul of the Jewish people engenders the thought that if you want one simple word to symbolize all of Jewish history, that word would be 'Jerusalem.'  Jews have been living in Jerusalem continuously for nearly two millennia. They have constituted the largest single group of inhabitants there since the 1840's (map of Jerusalem in 1912) .Jerusalem contains the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.    Jerusalem was never the capital of any Arab entity. In fact, it was a backwater for most of Arab history. Jerusalem never served as a provincial capital under Muslim rule nor was it ever a Muslim cultural center. For Jews, the entire city is sacred, but Muslims revere a site  the Dome of the Rock  not the city.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	First of all, land must be paid for either by money or by the sacrifice of lives.  Israel has paid dearly on both counts.  Secondly, the quantitative analysis has been done and it seems that by the year 2020, 98% of the world's population will have some part of Abraham's DNA.  Thirdly, the Torah is not to be taken literally (except for Leviticus and parts of Deuteronomy).  The stories are spiritual metaphors for our Jewish history.  To rationalize land ownership by ancestral heritage is pure bullshit.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	Canaanites people are the NATIVES people of Jerusalem and all Levant region...many of modern Arabs of levant are descended of the Canaanites as the Palestinian...

The Jewish Homeland issue is far more complex than that, especially given what happened in the Holocaust.  Israelis only see their need for a homeland, not the Palestinians rights, after all the Arab nations have plenty of land right?    Most Human populations have migrated over the millennia.  We're all natives of almost everywhere so it's all BS.  The issue is around a place where your values are respected.  The Israeli's feel that they don't have anywhere else that they can go and be guaranteed of a safe future. History would suggest that maybe they're right.  as for the Arab's well mostly they come from migrant populations as well, so it's just complex|`|fT6VVji9aa	Israelis did not exist as such in bygone days.  There were Jews and there were Arabs.  The Jews lived in Egypt and were enslaved by the Egyptians until they broke free and went elsewhere [perhaps to Palestine, who knows, as every place was called differently then].  The Jews only got to live in Israel in 1949 after the British and Americans decided they were hard done by [and they were] and gave them the right to move into Palestine.  Never mind what the Palestinians thought of it - that wasn't even considered.  Now it has become "Israel" and the Palestinians are considered 2nd class citizens in their own country.

zgDQrI2uaa	Yes, there is difficulty in the conversation.   There is Cajun French, Creole French (very similar to Cajun), and modern French.  I worked at the airport with two old men one who spoke Cajun French and the other Creole French and they would talk all day long.  One day a little old couple from France who spoke no English came along and I got the old Cajun to tell them how to get to the rental counter.  It was almost as bad as if he were speaking in English to them.      Mama never spoke much Cajun French because she was embarrassed; most old school Cajuns were made to feel ignorant and that their French dialect was just bad French.  It's sad how Cajun/Creole French was almost stomped out by the Americans.|`|dl1yuCoFaa	Sure there are people in Louisiana who speak French.

I think it is mostly because when people make a reference to England in America it usually encompasses all of Britain. It's really only the Britts that care about this though. Also most Americans only know where Mexico and Canada is. Because they are close. You probably know all of Europe. Because most European countries are small and therefore you are all close, so its more important to know more contries. And America is a really big entertainment hub, you know of our actors, we don't know half of yours. So of course you know where we are. And also you DO have a better education system, so instead of making fun of American's for being stupid, just be happy that you have a system that is better funded and gets better results than ours. British aren't smarter than American's, they just learn more than we do.
ejujoezgaa	I edited my reply after seeing you are from Australia.  Assuming you're committed to Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, you probably have a full plate with lots of driving in between.  A night in Vegas should be doable (your kids are apt to enjoy Vegas more than the Grand Canyon -- Stratosphere thrill rides, etc.).    You're planning to cover a very long distance and will spend much of your time driving over some boring, very hot distances.  If it's not too late to change your plans, you might want to consider sticking to one or the other -- 1)  Yosemite and the northern CA area (Napa Valley, San Simeon, Monterey, and Sequoia & Kings Canyon)  or 2) fly into LAX, go to Las Vegas (consider Death Valley, although it's very nasty in July), stop at the Hoover Dam, swing down to the Grand Canyon, and head back by way of Sedona, Lake Havasu and Palm Springs.  You might even have time for a tour of Hollywood or a visit to Universal Studios, Disneyland, etc.!  In July, I personally would prefer 2), because Yosemite isn't the same without its waterfalls (although it's still spectacular); you might luck out in early July, but I doubt it, because CA's snowpack supposedly is the smallest in years.  CA's wildfires also are becoming more intense and may impact northern CA in July.    http://www.yosemitefun.com/yosemite_best...    Consider joining the American Automobile Association (if you belong to its Australian counterpart, you may get complimentary services), and getting trip kits for any trip you plan.  You also might want to make certain to have a GPS device.    *****    Yosemite and Las Vegas are good choices, although Yosemite is more spectacular in the spring, fall or even winter, when there is more water flow to enhance its spectacular water features, which likely will be DRY in July.      Yosemite also is sufficiently close to you (assuming you live in San Francisco) that you could visit it some other time, off-season.  Yosemite will be very crowded in July.    Vegas is a good choice, but I'm not certain what you do with the RV there.    How many days do you plan to spend at Grand Canyon?  Assuming two days there and two days back, you only have three days to spend doing things.    Since you're planning to travel in July, have you considered combining a camping trip with a night in Vegas?  You could just rent three small tents.  Camp in the upper area of Yosemite or some other park on your way to Vegas, with the emphasis on avoiding traffic.  This would give you an opportunity to get a half-day jump on your trip, not constrained by the RV rental terms.  You probably will make better time as well in a car.    After visiting Vegas, be certain to at least walk across the top of the Hoover Dam.  I personally love the tour, but your kids might not like it.    Stay in a hotel in Vegas with the money saved.  In the Grand Canyon, stay in one of the Yellowstone lodges (you also could book a cheaper cabin; make all reservations very soon) one night, camp the other night(s).  Personally, one day at Grand Canyon is sufficient IMO, unless you're going down into the canyon.  I especially like walking the rim at dusk/after dark in Grand Canyon Village, and being at the east end of the park for sunrise (many persons camp there just for this event).  Travel on the South Rim is very convenient with the bus system, but I would want to stay in Grand Canyon Village.    As you're coming to the Grand Canyon from the north, you could check out the north rim.  Walking out on the old Navajo Bridge on your way to the Grand Canyon supposedly is a treat:    http://www.pigseye.com/mc/4corners/leesf...    Some experts say if the Grand Canyon didn't exist, persons still would come from the world over to visit Sedona, the surrounding Red Rock Country and Oak Creek Canyon (see pictures at pigseye link below).    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Creek_C...    As you're doing a natural wonders trip, you might want to consider a stop at San Jacinto State Park near Palm Springs on your return trip.  However, it might be out of your way and you don't have lots of time.  The plateau at the top of the tramway is one of the most beautiful places I've seen.    http://www.pstramway.com/    The London Bridge is at Lake Havasu!    http://www.roadtripamerica.com/places/ha...

LCAzlHhEaa	My husband and I went to Hawaii last Feb.  there is alot to see and do on the island of Oahu.  You will definitely want to check out Pearl Harbor, also if you like Pineapples go to the Dole Pineapple Plantation and try some Pineapple ice cream; you can also have fresh pineapples shipped home to you which is a yummy treat when you get home.    Drive up to the north shore and watch the large waves, there is a number you can call; ask at your hotel front desk to get a wave report.  It's awesome to see the large waves.  Go to the Polynesian Cultural Center that's fun, and we took a sunset dinner cruise; when our captain saw whales he stopped the boat so we could take pictures and see the whales.      This website is what I used to help plan activities:  www.gohawaii.com, also just search on the net for things to do in Oahu.  Oh, and I also recommend renting a car, it's great being able to come and go as you please.  If you have a GPS system take it with you because it can be a little tricking driving around the city, and they are expensive to rent with a rental car.    Have a great trip!|`|BJIo6twUaa	One place i would recommend is the Polynesian Cultural Center. Its all day and get the dinner and watch the show Horizons. The last few days i was stationed at Hickam AFB, i went to it and enjoyed it. They have all kinda events all day and other events going on the different Islands that each area repents. Here is the link to their web page.    http://www.polynesia.com/shows/horizons....

It used to be an internet novel but someone discovered it and made a movie on it!~:] you should watch it too.. its tragic though the actress who was in it killed herself last year or a few years ago....|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Was he doing cool? or Was he cool?|`|dc6b4bfdb75c28be32d965d3d43e476daa	Yes, it's Japanese and it means "Was he (or she, though less likely) cool-looking?".
GBXvJ5mjaa	Well, think about it. If there are only so many taxis, and a whole lot of people.. How are you going to stop a whole lot of people from rushing into a taxi all at once? Well by raising the prices. If a taxi is expensive enough people might plan their trips more effeciently as opposed to making multiple single passenger trips around the city in all different directions. Also, I'm sure only a limited about of taxis are allowed compared to the amount of road, so that could also be another limit for supply / demand. And in a bigger city you are probably more likely to get into an accident. The higher prices would offset the insurance. Bigger cities usually have more expensive gas prices.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	you could negotiate (for un-metered price) with the taxi driver before you get in , but once you get in you have to pay (by law). If there are other people wanting to take that taxi he is unlikely to budge , but if you were the only passenger he probably will agree or will meet you halfway at least. Your chances get better if several taxi drivers want to pick you up.    The 30 sounds above average for that trip , but may be its a private taxi company wanting to stick passengers for the Salik toll gate charge (you passed one between Emirates mall and IBM)

There are three main ones. http://mycareer.com.au/ ; http://www.seek.com.au/ and http://www.careerone.com.au  So the best way would be the internet tough.Also this is another important link to most of the jobs available in australia : http://jobsearch.gov.au/default.aspx . Depending on the job you are looking for.For the labour jobs, it is better to register with job services providers like Integrated Group, Workforce, Trojan, Staff Express and many others. They also offer professinaal vacancies like in  enginering.
pgFD4n1Caa	frankly, don't do it. Seattle - like the rest of the country- is laying off lots of people.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i've done it a few times, but that was when there was work to be had.  i would not do it now.|`|SiniSj1eaa	My mom lives in Seattle and I moved here over a year ago to be with her and had no job in line. I found two jobs here in just a week. That again was over a year ago and the economy may not help your situation. I was also able to stay with my mom for a couple months to get on my feet, and that really helped.    I would not have done it if my Mom didnt live here and I knew I had that security. I have several friends with college degrees right now in the Seattle area who are on unemployment. Our unemployment rate is over 10% right now.     Also please keep in mind how expensive it really is to live here. I have a decent 1 bedroom apt in a suburb of Seattle and pay 875 for it. Food is also very expensive. A dozen eggs can sometimes cost almost $3!! (depending where you go....but non the less food is a lot more expensive)    I noticed the person above me recomended the caretaking thing at nursing homes. A lot of times thats for CNAs (nurses assitants, and you have to be certified to do that.) If your willing to attend the 6 week program then yes, you would ALWAYS have a job with  that...but it really doesnt pay that well..|`|uKWcgLLoaa	It's definitely risky at this particular time. HOWEVER, there is at least one job for which there is always going to be demand over the next few decades and that is CARETAKING of the elderly and disabled. If you are physically fit and into doing that kind of work, you are likely to be hired to help in facilities that do that. Otherwise, you may be hard pressed to find work, except perhaps at low paying retail or manual labor jobs. Depends somewhat on your skills, interests, and personality.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	No, I wouldn't, not without family support.  I moved back home to live with my parents once...2 months later still no job and that was in better economic times.  We have lay offs here in WA too and the coastal communities were hurting first.  They always have the highest unemployment rate.  With the economy the way it is right now it would be a foolish move at best.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	Not in this economy, no.

90tPT5nlaa	It's nice and warm in Cairns and Darwin, but there aren't any beaches in Darwin. Cairns doesn't actually have beaches either, although nearby Port Douglas does. You can also visit the Great Barrier Reef and go snorkelling from Cairns/Port Douglas. Sydney and Brisbane will be too cold for the beach, their climate is rather similar to Italy's. Alice Springs will be quite cold at night.|`|cEa8TTenaa	In giugno e luglio nei locali che hai menzionato e' inverno - ma a Sydney fa' molto piu' freddo che negli altri posti. A Alice Springs (che si tratta di deserto) fa caldo durante la giornata e freddo la notte. Brisbane in luglio e come Roma or Napoli in ottobre, ma molto umido. In Cairns e Darwin non fa mai freddo perche' sono dei locali tropicali.    Devi cercare un sito apposito per trovare temperature medie per ogni luogo. Ti ho lasciato un link per Sydney - ci sono simili per altri citta'.    Buon viaggio (si - ci sono delle persone che parlano Italiano anche qua')
NyJeK6NSaa	Of course as every individual from various all countries do. No person unemployed or who expects a growth in job career will like it, as some one else is grabbing a chance from him.|`|cEa8TTenaa	It's the same everywhere - Australians feel about sharing their jobs just like the English feel about Australians sharing theirs. The world is that kind of place and no one can change it - people simply travel and go to other countries and sometimes work there. There is no such thing as a country where this does not happen.    I'm sorry about your work situation - there are people experiencing this kind of thing all over the world, and it has less to do with who works where than it has to do with the global financial situation.    It'll get better soon.    And remember - no matter what financial situation exists, some people do well.    Good luck. I understand how you feel.|`|HUee9mo1aa	I live in Cairns (up the top of Australia) and it's great for visitors. It's the best place for tourists to come to see the reef... so, we get a lot of tourists. Honestly, I think we have more tourists than locals.    So, yeah. If you flick through the paper, you'll find heaps of jobs, and almost all of them are open tourists.    I understand that you won't be a tourist, and you'll be more permanent, but if we're that welcoming for tourists, why wouldn't we be even more so for International visitors that are staying for a while?    Oh, at my workplace... only two of the employees are local. Thought I'd throw that in. =D

Best Holiday Park,.|`|Gt3hRAA1aa	Get a boat to Ireland...or Amsterdam...always fun|`|aqLLbzJQaa	Once you have crossed the channel either by boat or through the tunnel you can then reach all of Europe, Asia and Africa without flying - so there is a massive choice available to you - what sort of holidays do you like - beaches ? - adventure  ? - skiing ? - exploration ? - Safari ? - mountain climbing ? - every thing is available to you|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	Usually I would suggest Amsterdam, Paris or a Belgian city, but then you said you have a 2000 budget! I'm not sure if you're looking for sun or a city break or adventure or what, but I'll try to suggest a few things..    Cruises is what first comes to mind. I can't recommend any particular websites, but you can do great cruises around Scandinavia, say Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.     Iceland has amazing landscapes, lava spas (such as the Blue Lagoon, Google image it!), and an incredible nightlife. Go on a Friday to join in 'runtur', where every Friday the hardworking Icelanders of Reykjavik party like there's no tomorrow.     Copenhagen and Stockholm are highlights, and in Iceland, Norway Sweden and possibly Finland, you could spot the Northern Lights! So Scandinavian cruises are great, and a bit different. Shop around and you should find something to suit your budget.     There's also Baltic cruises, Helsinki, St Petersburg, Riga (Latvia) and Tallinn (Estonia) are all cities worth visitng, Tallinn especially, its more undiscovered. Be warned though, Riga's vibrant nightlife attracts a lot of stag dos. But if 'old town' architecture is your thing, a Baltic cruise would be perfect.     There's the Mediterranean cruises too of course, but they don't really need so much of an introduction! I doubt you'd get any sun though, at least not until April at the earliest, which is why I suggested more Northern cruises. You should find something to suit your budget, especially as its not peak season.    If your dates are flexible, try Travelzoo.co.uk. If you go on there now, on the homepage click on 'Cruise & Ferry specials'. The last minute deals there are incredibly discounted.    Use travelsupermarket.com to compare prices on pretty much anything travel/holiday related.     The Daily Telegraph Travel supplement (I think its the one on Saturday) has listings of everything travel-related, and lists some great deals.     That's all I can think of at the moment, I'll come back and edit if I think of/find anything else. Hope this helped and have a great time whatever you end up doing:)    EDIT- Ok, I just realised your name is 'sunshine me'!! So I might need to change my answer a bit! Nice in the South of France on the Cote d'Azur is hands down the best place I have ever been to. Mainly because I 'studied' there when I was 17 one summer and met other fun students and partied like there was no tomorrow (like they do in Iceland!) but there a many sights of interest (museums, art galleries, Russian cathedral) fabulous beaches (ok, they're pebble, but if you go to a private one (about 20 euros for a day, plus parasol and sunlounger and waitress) you can sip cocktails all day, tan and relax in the lovely warm waters. The beaches also become party heaven at night (try to avoid height of summer, its a bit too euro-studenty.) Nightlife is fantastic too. Excellent food. Cafe culture. Interesting people. Great shopping. Get the Eurostar to Paris, and then the train to Nice. If you want to know anymore on Nice, drop me an email on my profile page!!|`|oSig1lQoaa	Go to Jersey or one of the other channel islands|`|J9pIrpkBaa	You could get a boat to france?|`|bH1DYr5saa	Paris? You can take the Eurostar. Or another European City accessable by train or sea.
qdsVS1dDaa	About the only thing that you can do is to pull up this itinerary every day and look at the price. Cumbersome, but it will work.    Regards,  Dan
Lt8UFEIoaa	I believe the best part is the billabongs, as thats what Kakadu is most famous for!! At Yellow river you can do a cruise and see crocodiles, billabongs and birdlife. The accommodation at Cooinda is much better than Jabiru. Jabiru is really not a nice place to stay. Do a four wheel drive tour to Jim Jim falls and Twin falls, or a scenic flight over the falls and Arnhem land.   On the way to/from Darwin you can also do a crocodile cruise on the Adelaide river. They hand feed the crocodiles that leap almost entirely out of the water to get the food. Amazing!!
rLxkshZBaa	wow.. I'm surprised that I read everything on your question even if its too long (and you dont even finished the sentence). Well.. I can understand your situation. Let me tell you this.. dont stick to a job where you can never 'advance' or move foward. But in your situation and in this economy condition.. start looking for other job now. I'm sure there still a vacant for designers out there. Once you got and 'confirm' with the job.. QUIT! Teach them a lesson because they never appreciate what you did for them. Good Luck.|`|RhZtLOXyaa	Very hard time now baby so hang on to your job and do the best you can.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Interesting question since my two favorite ports of call are Cozumel and St Thomas.  Depends on which one has the better itinerary you like and which ship you like best.    For me I like western caribbean best.  I love Cozumel and Belize.  They are amazing with so much to see and do.  Plus the water is smoother more inland and warmer.    I think I'd look at the itinerary, the ship, and the cruise line before making my selection.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Southern caribbean is best, but all of the destinations have merits.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	I prefer the Eastern, just because I prefer the islands over Mexico. I'm sure there are others who are the opposite.  It really doesn't matter. Once you take one cruise you will take a second.( Out next will be thirteen, I think)  What you don't see this trip you'll see next trip.  Also try different cruise lines.   We've been on carnival, great, but it was our first  Norwegian, Never again  Royal Carribean 10 times, Next I think will be Celebrity|`|q1GnMRxxaa	I have been to both and both are great, but my favorite was the Eastern Caribbean, especially St, Thomas. The snorkeling there was some of the best I have ever done(trunk bay). This was my first cruise too, so it was extra special.|`|7d8e86a9aedfe299e8309f1c873cc2d5aa	Having cruised all over the Carib, I recommend (in order) Southern, Eatsern, Western.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	I did the western caribbean cruise in December and the sea water was very warm.

AA10956234	I'm Mobinil , but I don't like it, it's the worse,    Etisalat is the cheapest and the newest Network so it must be better than the old ones, but still there is places you will not find network coverage.   Etisalat also are making great offers,     Vodafone is unique, they have real competitive prices & fees, and the coverage is good and they have other good services,     For me, I prefer Vodafone or Etisalat.|`|825a07e94b3061119d7b183db44bbad4aa	VodaFone is the best..    Best coverage, best customer service and best marketing campaigns.

And as Im satisfied with it, I dont care about the others,I even dont look at their offers or adv. coz Im not that kind of people that change their Network for offers!  I just care for the Network and Vodafone's Network is more than just amazing.|`|TUdMqnD6aa	I use Etisalat and of course it worth using.  cheap and simple to remeber  011 is its code|`|1148622cf8972dbc25aac49df8fd7415aa	Mobinil coverage is good but quality is poor.  Call accessibility is good, retentivity is bad, and mobility is bad. But luckily its better than the other 3 operators.    Vodafone coverage is not as good as Mobinil but the 3G network is better in some respects.    Etisalat coverage is bad but 3G network is good, but the HSDPA Thruput is not always reliable. They need to optimize the MAXHSRATE Parameter in the ericsson Node B's.|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	i prefer vodafone never try etisalat but i hate mobinil service|`|hiKtjrWNaa	i love Mobinil, service, adds, coverage, offers...    i love Vodafone, but not sure about the coverage..    i hate Etisalate, service and coverage is so bad..|`|1PBT0C4Caa	Mobinil    I hate vodafone b2a sha3by awi :p|`|BAmNCDXUaa	hehehe    i  used For Vodafone in spain and it was very nice and cheap Minute also  and when i try it in here  its very Expensive  Anyway  ALL of them take my money so i DUnt care who is the better  but i guess  Vodafone its Not bad!!  cuz no one of them are good|`|Lw9hX3A8aa	ana mobinil, best coverage , have always very good offers we 3omraha ma2saret m3aya besara7a and i love the ads!    Etisalat is cheap but bad quality    Vodafone survives because people in Egypt have 3o2det el khawaga, like.....its international yabney....mobinil de masreya!!!!|`|ghMhb406aa	Well,let's cmpare the slogans:  Mobinil~shabaket al ma7moul al 2oola fi misr  Vodafone~shabakat al ma7moul al 2oola fi al 3alam..  So,it's obvious that vodafone is better..  About Etisalat~not sure,,my friends use it but they complain about the coverage sometimes...  >>>My opinion is not baised as i'm a mobinil user!!
94afe4952ece81da965bb995fbb216d0aa	I beg to differ Effendi, Danum do get overbooked. Anyway, i am working with a travel agency and i can help you to arrange for your trip here in Sabah. Pls feel free to email me and let me know of your plan.|`|fd69272cc2b6016b2264e570e7b7a247aa	Yes, both destinations are expensive, but then both are exceptional and unique in the world. You should book Sipadan (that is you'll be in Mabul, or Semporna etc as you can't stay on Sipadan any more) in advance, because it is terribly popular and dive operators tend to be well booked. All offer about the same rates, some a bit more comfort than others, and all offer excellent dive masters.     Danum Valley is offered through most travel agents here in Sabah but only one agent is authorised to bring in tourists, so all tour operators have to go through that one government approved travel agent: Inno Travel & Tour Services Sdn Bhd (http://sabahholidays.com/v1/index.php), and you might as well contact them. But shop around on the internet and see if you can get lower prices. Inno gives out corporate rates and it is possible that some travel agency can offer cheaper rates than Inno publishes. It is always worth while looking around a bit, though you can arrange Danum once you are here in Sabah, it is never overbooked.     Happy travelling!

AA10792562	Some people dress up,and others wear jeans.    Get the half price tickets that go on sale the day of the performance - ask the hotel concierge.    Also - visit Ground Zero.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	These days, its all over the place.    You will see some people dressed up, and you will see others looking like they just rolled out of bed.    Casual, without being sloppy is fine. Even jeans are ok if they look nice and are matched with a decent top.|`|mDDUsNG9aa	Business casual is a safe bet..WInter clothing is the dress of choice its 12 degrees right now high of 24...This weekend it going to be in the middle 50's to low 60's..Sweater and a jacket will be ok...Also check the restaurants you plan on eating at see if they have a dress code, also in the playbill there are some discounts for restaurants in the theater district save you some money and the food is good|`|UHip02Gxaa	Personally, I think the proper dress code is dressed up.  Business casual-like for men, skirts/dresses for women.  About half the people will look like this.    BUT, unfortunately, the other half will be wearing jeans.  Mostly tourists I think who fail to respect the awesomeness that is Broadway.    Have fun!|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	There is no dress code REQUIREMENT when you go to see a Broadway show. Most people dress casual (but not sloppy) while others like to dress a bit more dressy. Go with what makes you feel comfortable.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	There really isn't one any more, and some people take that a bit too far, but then again, you're sitting in the dark, so maybe it doesn't matter what people are wearing. I remember the days when  you dressed up to go on a plane.  God, nobody does that anymore.  Coach looks like a flying trailer park.    I like to wear business casual to the theater, for my own sense of standards.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Every cruise I have been on has an art auction. Most run by the same company, Park West. The only exception is Princess which runs its own art auction. Without the middle man I am sure you get better prices and service.    ? ??l???q ?|`|T19HI9mFaa	I've been on Carnival, Princess, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean. Every cruise I've taken has had at least one art auction during the cruise. The works are certainly not from the great masters, but every cruise says the works are original by known artists. I've never seen anything I thought worth purchasing, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the prices people pay. Perhaps they are more knowledgeable about art than I am.|`|AA11008781	Pretty much all the cruise lines do the art auctions........Don't kid yourself; I have been on more than one Princess Cruise and the art auctions arent always what they seem.....Buyer beware!!!

[Joking w/ you]  But I think you could research|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	yes, and cheap fake jewelry|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	Every US based cruise line I have been on have had art auctions, NCL, Princess, Celebrity, Royal Caribbean.   I have to say that the best was definitely Princess, the art was no better or worse than the other lines, probably exactly the same as it is all run by the same company, but the champagne flowed more liberally on the Princess ships.     Funnily enough, I was looking at on-line auctions and I found an advert for a job as an art auctioneer for cruise lines and the wage was $50,000 to $100,000 a year, so there must be money in it.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Celebrity, Holland America, and Cunard do.  You will notice that the less expensive the cruise, the lower the quality of the art sold.  Cunard auctions generally deal with the high end stuff, and I have never seen sports memorabilia, photos, or cheesy stuff on Cunard.

I live in riyadh now and it is v arab and believe me its not much recommended! Riyadh is dug up all over it has only ONE good street which is Olayah street (even that will impress only the saudis!!), there is chaos everywhere... give me the pretty, broad boulevards of dubai anyday!|`|GOMThToVaa	Aren't they supposed to be called freedom fries!?|`|SAqOCOeZaa	yes, every modern city these days are americanised|`|ScHW4842aa	as far as i know, it is still pretty arabic in all its values - despite their being a 'burger king' or whatever sign.|`|uvx3cnkJaa	There is a chuck E cheese in Saudi as well but its far from being americanised. What matters is the culture. I can tell you Dubai has no culture. Dubai was nothing twenty years ago no body knew where it was on the map but look today how it's on the centre of the globe. These changes took their toll with the Imaratis thus the government had to do something so they came up with this, I think, brilliant idea. They gave the Imaraits big houses on other Emirates and just outside Dubai city and left the centre of Dubai to expats. Therefore, to answer your question: is Dubai Americanised? It is but can you find any arabic culture left? yes all you have to do is go a little further outside Jumeira and here you'd find them and you'd think that you entered a new country. Weird but interesting :)|`|hMTL2AV7aa	what so special about left hand drive , all the arab countries drive left hand . So does Europe and many other places in the world. I have noticed that other than India, right hand driving is mainly found in Island nations.|`|6310a09c4d020682e9d6c5ab9ed40ba8aa	Sad isn't it? There's not many places left in the world that don't have those damned silly American influences. No matter where you go you can find those hideous golden arches and all sort of stuff like that.    Oner of the joys of travelloing is to experience different cultures. I find it quite dpressing to think that if things keep on at this rate there will only be one (the worst one in the world) American.|`|qbsd9MMGaa	yes it is. Arabic culture there is in dander of extinction. as well as local Arabs themselves|`|8prHQSZDaa	Maybe in the eyes of some foreigners ..    you don't see the heritage and cultural side .. because you are living and interacting with the modern side.    its Ok
PA0bGBtCaa	I agree with the other two posters that you will need permission from anyone who is in the film. You will also need the permission from the captain to legally do this during flight. Not that it will mess with flight instruments, becasue it won't, but because he's responsible for anything that goes on inside the cabin.    You should also print out waivers to give to anyone who will be filmed to cover your own ***. Sure there are tons of videos on You Tube from inside airplanes, but trust me, all it takes is one person who sees themself and say "wait, I wasn't asked to be filmed!" and you can find a nice lawsuit on your hands. That person would just get a court order from the airline to release the name of the person who was sitting in seat XX with a video camcorder.    That's just a possibility, but one that you should try to avoid. I'd stick to mainly shooting outside the windows during flight and hide it for take off and landing so you can still film those two parts.|`|X6rFPI2laa	You will certainly need permission of the flight crew, and of any passengers you might want to film.  I suspect you will be told you cannot, due to possible interference with the crew and passengers.  How about just some shots of the airport and the gate?|`|Tcwru3eDaa	you will need permission from the crew and passengers but i think it will be okay because there is lots of videos made on aircraft just look at U tube          happy flying by the way air India is great i love them|`|15EjSfH3aa	Yes, you can record inside a plane......... but I suggest you that try to record on mobile and not on camcorder. The crew will not mind much if you just try decently. But a camcorder can be objectionable. A mobile can't give them any reason to raise objection unless and until you don't disturb anyone or you come in attentions of other. Try to avoid  coming in attention of other people. Take your mobile on off flight mode with you. ''NOKIA 72 or 63'' can serve your purpose. Sony too have many mobiles whom functions like camera can work without SIM. (one of my friends tried this, he took pics)    Wish you a nice and comfortable journey !!!  :-)  If you like monkeys........ go to HIMACHAL PRADESH (in India).......... it has lots of monkeys................ lol !!!

42tTsVuxaa	Europe's a big place, depends where you want to live. from a few hundered euros to a few thousand a month    Good luck     RR|`|dpKntiZoaa	Sweetheart - not meaning to sound condescending, but do you realise what you are asking.    The price of houses in one street are often very different   - multiply that the different streets in a town\  - by the towns (and villages and others) in a region  - by the regions in a country  - and finally by the fact that Europe is not a country, but a continent made up of 48+ countries.    If someone was to give you an average for the continent at large - it would be virtually meaningless.    Take into consideration also the fact that 'cost of living' also plays a big part.  Houses in e.g. the UK are substantially more expensive that Poland, so you might think that it would be most cost-effective to live in Poland - but then if your monthly salary was also lower then it is no point comparing the two.  The two things (cost of living and salaries) are relative to one another in most countries.  So you do need to factor this in also.    If you are very serious about this ambition, then I would give one piece of advice - travel!  Save up the money, book a trip, take a couple of months (depending on your immigration status) and travel around the different countries - get to see things with your own eyes and have your own experiences.  Find out places you like and don't like - and then you can look at what is viable for you (getting a visa to live and work in the EU is pretty difficult anyway if you are non-EU).    Then by all means ask specific questions about houses and so on, for the area or country you find appealing - but asking this question is only get you "best guesses" or more likely sweeping comments (probably like mine I know!)    EDIT - ouch, and maybe you need to temper your attitude as well, as that kind of approach is not really appreciated on this side of the water!  What I said was 'fact' and not sarcasm.    Travel!  It's a wonderful experience and you will gain so much from it - broadening your horizons and getting an idea of how large and diverse countries actually are, (and no, I'm being honest again and not sarcastic, before you say it).

A catch all for anything from 'that's disgusting' to 'too much information']    "That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my entire life."

[When I'm fed up I say this but I'm really not any where near done]    "Try to maintain some semblance of control."

The nature of your relationship with close ones, automatically drags your emotions when you say something to them. unlike saying the same thing to a regular person.

sgApJkSmaa	Prepare your body for an East/West travel:  - If you're flying west of your time zone then go to bed later  - If you're flying east of your time zone then go to sleep earlier    Do this a few days before your flight and practice sleeping in a darkened room. Get enough water (avoid alcohol) -- it will help prevent dehydration and lessen the biological effects of jet lag.|`|pHqkympaaa	Regardless of where you are going, try and alter your sleeping patterns to match your destination.

V8yR8BU1aa	haha.. well    Winnipeg is pretty cold that's for sure.  In the West we call it "Winter-peg".  Other than that, it's ont he Red River and there's lots of lakes and trillions of mosquitos in the summer time.    That.. and we all miss the Winnipeg Jets and hope that one day the Coyotes will move back.    Those movies were pretty funny btw.|`|XfjAwH7Haa	Winnipeg is alright. They drink a lot of slurpees.|`|NWopkX4baa	Winnipeg is an interesting city! It has a lot of great arts and cultural things going on, including Guy Maddin (who is a genius even though I can't stand to watch his movies--but I haven't seen My Winnipeg .yet).     I know a few ex-Winnipegers who are all pretty cool, down to earth, smart people.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	I've tried watching My Winnipeg.  Sorry to Guy Maddin, but I'm just not that into you.  It's a very different style of film, and does not grab me in the least.

GqfiRXu3aa	Chicago is very cold in the winter, but it has the best public transportation of any of the other cities you listed.    Santa Fe is beautiful (I've never been but have seen pics), but I'm sure their public transportation is lacking.      Anywhere in California, without a car, you cannot live there.  You NEED a car in California.    Probably Chicago is your best bet.  If you had a car I'd advise you differently.|`|UzSaTblgaa	I don't know what type of weather you would prefer.  You need a big city for good urban transportation and for access to nice living areas.  I would choose Chicago first despite it's frigid winters, it is a wonderful city and easy to get around in.  Then I would pick Arlington Virginia for its wonderful weather but I don't know about transportation in the city, it's a small city at best.  California is always good but I don't know those cities.  I would stay away from Miami, Atlanta, Iowa, Kentucky and Seattle (awful weather).  Stick with Chicago, Virginia and California.|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	Louisville KY because it is the best combination of safe and affordable while having a great night life. The 'Ville has one of the best park systems in the nation.    If you don't drive you'd really like living in The Highlands or Crescent Hill. Old Louisville (btw Downtown & U of L) is the largest Victorian Historic District in the US and has incredible architecture and bus routes everywhere    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Louisvi...|`|URO3gDXcaa	not driving limits your options.  chicago, and dc would be your best 2 options as the public transportation systems are the best of the list.|`|d0ff48441cb372a53ded2d0fa9ac55bfaa	First of all you should know that Arlington, Virginia, is just across the river from Washington, DC; consider them the same place.    That said, of your list only there (Washington/Arlington) and Chicago fulfill your parameters of being close to major airports AND have a good public transit system, AND are vibrant cities with broad cultural and intellectual activities,   Seattle would be included if it had a better public transportation system.  Atlanta might be included except that its desirable neighborhoods and depth of cultural variety are limited.  Mendon, MA might be included if it were located closer to Boston or Providence (Mendon, MA??  How did Mendon get on your list??  Unlike all the rest of your list I cannot think of any university or medical institution or scientific establishment or anything similar that awards grants that exists in Mendon!!)|`|gXJdryRNaa	Good luck on your grant.    I would choose Chicago first.  But that is just me personally.  People flock to Chicago to see all the sights (including concerts, sports games, museums, Shedd Aquarium - the best aquarium I have ever seen), etc.  Chicago also has an excellent transportation system and has O'Hare airport and Midway.      Sante Fe and Albuquerque are wonderful places to visit as well.  If you are into a free spirt type of thinking and love creative art work you are in the right place.  Down to earth and friendly people.  Warm weather doesn't hurt either.    Washington DC is beautiful.  Home to the Smithsonian Museums, The White House and Capital, not to mention all the history and monuments there.  DC also has some great clubs and restaurants.  Good transportation system there too.  Can almost always find a cab and not too expensive (which really surprised me)|`|nWjnuYDUaa	Miami would be my  1 pick, because its warm has an airport and a great nightlife. Plus, there are tons of beaches, shopping and malls.  You will be about 2 hrs from disneyworld, 3hrs from Tampa and 3hrs from the Florida Keys. Plus there is historic St. Augustine.  Basically, you can't get bored in Miami.    Chicago is obviously a big city, but it is cold if you like that.  Atlanta should also be pretty nice and close to the airport. Houston is also warm and by an airport.    Some places you listed sound a bit more rural, but if you like country living, go with them.|`|bH1XfyTYaa	I've been to about half of these places, and not all of them are truly "cities" in the commonly-accepted sense.  Unless you are a huge fan of cold weather, freezing rain, hail, bone-chilling winds, ice and snow, I'd avoid places like Connecticut, Chicago, Coon Rapids IA (how did it get on the list anyway?), Mendon MA, Louisville KY, Ogden UT, Washington state, Beatrice NE, etc.  My top recommendations (having been to all of these) would be: Miami FL, Atlanta, GA, Santa Fe & Albuquerque NM, Houston TX, Arlington VA, and Washington DC.  My top personal choice would be Santa Fe.  The city is absolutely gorgeous with an incredible blend of cultures.  Santa Fe Trails is their public transit system, and although it is under-utilized it offers multiple routes throughout the city with pickups about every 20-30 minutes.  The weather is mild and bearable, even though it snows a bit in the winter.  The nearest larger airport is in Albuquerque, which is a drawback, but the pleasures of Santa Fe outweigh the small inconvenience.
iy1mXC0Saa	i think england is the worst place you could visit, it is non stop rain/snow/miserable weather    but.      Thorpe Park is a must, everyone loves it there.    London Eye, London Dungeons.    Legoland,    hyde park    02 arena for concerts etc    ice skating in somerset house    trafalgar square.    Thats a few for london (except thorpe park and legoland which are outside london)    London is the best place to go for site seeing and things to do really.    but other places are good as well.    Cornwall you get the countryside feel.
AA11349530	there's usually stuff to do in country towns apart from visiting museums, but I doubt you'd find it on the internet ... you'd really need to go to the place and talk to the locals while you're supping your ale|`|UzPFTdUFaa	The best thing about England is its beautiful countryside; get off the roads and hike the hills and forests.|`|VWtamazEaa	Go surfing in Cornwall and go for some walks in the Lake District.

Ok I'll admit, a real english pub is great, but these are all things you could do anywhere. If your gonna spend a year in England, your not going to plan the whole trip in detail. You'll go where you are taken! I would definantly visit Dorset, see the jurassic coast and Brownsea Island.  Also check out the countryside in Cornwall, and further up north. Just go everywhere! You could easily do that in a year (England isn't very big!)

He works for a software company and travels to fix the problems people have with their software.  It's based on more individual personalized service whereas many of these companies are like a telemarketing room, with rows and rows of telephones.  It's an important question to ask in the interview and usually is based on how expensive the contract with your IT company is.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Mostly IT techs stay in a specific area.

AlbJmy7aaa	Ok, I've got it planned for you.    First you want to purchase your tickets from Egged going Jerusalem to Eilat.   This is such a popular route that is one of the only ones that allow advance reserved seating. Do this here:    http://www.egged.co.il/Eng/main.asp?lngC...    I suggest you buy round trip if you are going to have a good world cell phone because you can call ahead and change the times if need be.. or spend a little more and purchase 1 way.. no big deal.    Secondly, for vias, you need to arrive in Eilat early in the morning (or have stayed over night).  The only alternative requires you to turn in your passports to the Egyptian consulate in Eilat (with having taken photos at a nearby drugstore) and waiting 24 hours or more.    I would bring some passport sized photos of you and your kid with you, but I don't know of them being required there (for some reason they didn't do this last time my friend went).    Anyhow, here is the consulate info:    68 Afraty Street  Bna Betkha, Eilat  Tel: (7) 597-6115       The place is NOT open on Friday or Saturday for religious reasons. So you must arrive early Sun-Thur and expect delays.  The reason you do this is because you need a mainland Egyptian visa to leave Sinai.. otherwise you only get a free visa at Taba for East Sinai only.    After your taxi ride from the bus station to the consulate, you need another taxi to the Taba border crossing.    From here you will emerge in Egypt and immediately be hounded by people offering rides. At the MOST give them like 40 cents (2 Egyptian pounds) to take you around th corner to the East Delta bus station.    The bus station is very cheap and easy but its not clearly visible from the border, its just around a bend.. less than a mile.      From here you would purchase bus tickets to Dahab.   Dahab is very nice, cheap and close proximity to Mt Sinai. I recommend Bisbhishi, its a small village with some nice rooms (well nice for the price) and they have a tourist office located across the street in the back of the Sphynx hotel.    Info:    http://www.bishbishi.com/      Their excursions cost about 150 EP (about $30) and are either overnight (for sunrise) or during the day (sunset).  They are very long and require a decent hike up a hill.  It can be cold and windy up there (even in April) so either dress warm and bring snacks.. or expect to be somewhat hungry in your blankets that smell of camel dung.      When you arrange your trip and lodging also talk to them about your plans to go to Cairo. You can either use their minibus service or a regular bus from the station (minibus can be slightly cramped and unsafe at night but has less stops and quicker). Either way expect 6 to 10 hours (depending on traffic, stops, checkpoints/inspections in Suez etc) to arrive in Cairo.    The buses are looong travels but pretty comfortable (comparable to Israel's buses but a bit more dirty)    From there I recommend some of the nice cheap bedouin run hotels. One is called Bedouin Village near (its near Tal'at Harb Square I believe).  Bishbishi or your hotel in Dahab can also recommend things.    I would purchase an Egypt Lonely Planet book before you go (its expensive there) as it will give you all bus schedules and hotel info.      Have fun!  Enjoy yourself in Dahab (lots to do) and Cairo (even more to do.. I fell in love and stayed waaay longer than I had hoped).    Take a bus back to Taba from Cairo or to Dahab for a few days of unwinding from city life.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	By camel guided by the Bedouin.    I really would not recommend travelling through the Sinai these days unless you speak fluent Arabic and tell them you're not Jewish.

jPt4iwICaa	It's very simple, Tamara, as some people already explained.   One thing is unclear to me though: where did you hear that word "Vardaska"? No Serb uses that term - we either say Macedonia (the term we learnt at school ever since Tito gave them that name stealing it from the Greeks) or Fyromians (the term we're using ever since we left school, grew up and acquired basic knowledge of history, myself included). Very strange that you should use it.     Macedonia is part of Greece and has been so centuries before Slavs came to the Balkans. Now, we all know that, but we don't all want to admit it. Fyrom is a by-product of the dismantling of ex-Yugoslavia, and as I said before should be regarded as a teenager desperately seeking for her identity, even at the cost of stealing it from its much more mature neighbour Greece.|`|212FfV3faa	yes i can explain to you.  Macedonia is in north Greece. So, the government of F.Y.R.O.M. wants actually to be named "Macedonia", as well so that they can expand their country and to take Greek Macedonia -because they claim that it used to be theirs....But the funny thing is that there are historical facts that Macedonia was always Greek! But FYROM doesnt want to accept this.|`|a6p6zaYFaa	I'm Greek and I dont get it either. I think bulgarians are just jealous of us.|`|Sh3vYDr3aa	A controversy exists in regards to whether or not any parts of the historic region of Macedonia are incorporated in the present-day the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as very little if any of the ancient Macedonian kingdom is. There is also controversy, however, with regards to the Slavic peoples who are concentrated in less than half of the region. They first arrived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD when Slavic-speaking populations overturned Macedonia's Greek ethnic composition. As a result, the appropriation by the "Republic of Macedonia" of what Greece held as its "Greek symbols", raised concerns in Greece as well as fuelling nationalist anger. This anger was reinforced by the legacy of the Civil War and the view in some quarters, that members of Greece's Slavic-speaking minority were pro-Yugoslavian and presented a danger to its borders. The status of the Republic of Macedonia became a heated political issue in Greece where demonstrations took place in Athens while one million Macedonian Greeks took to the streets in Thessaloniki in 1992, under the slogan: "Macedonia is Greek", referring to the name and ancient history of the region, not posing a territorial claim against their northern neighbor. Initially, the Greek government objected formally to any use of the name Macedonia (including any derivative names) and also to the use of symbols such as the Vergina Sun. On the other hand, also in 1992, demonstrations by more than 100,000 ethnic Slav Macedonians took place in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, over the failure to receive recognition and supporting the constitutional name of the country.    The FYROM printed currency with landmarks currently located within Greek Borders and they were forced to destroy that money and change their flag... but they continue to lay claim to the ancient lands of Macedonia when they are only in possesion of 30% and the other land is in Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria and the majority in Greece. The part cannot claim the whole. How can you be a descendant of Alexander when your people did not come into the region until 9 centuries later?    Historical Macedonia is considered to be the realm of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great (4th century BC), 90 percent of which is now the Greek region of Macedonia and the remaining 10 percent in southwestern FYROM around Monastir, Bitola and toward the Ohrid lakes.  This area was known as Vadarska    So how can anyone say the FYROM was the western half? More like the Northwestern 10%...lol     Was Phillip Greek?  There is no question that he was. The ancient Macedonians spoke Greek. Exhaustive research shows that linguistically and culturally, the ancient Macedonians were Greek tribes. All inscriptions found in Macedonia dating from before the advent of the Romans are Greek, as are the names of peoples and their gods. The names Philip and Alexander derive from Greek words. That much is clear and anything else is the result of propaganda by Skopje. Alexander Himself proclaimed that he was a descendant of Greeks from Argos. So if the FYROMians claim to be descendants of Alexander than they are Also Greek by default since Alexander considered himself a Greek.    In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, they moved into the whole of the southern Balkans and created a strong population base in the area in question, where the populations had dwindled due to wars and invasions. Despite their efforts, however, they were unable to seize Thessaloniki, the joint capital, in a manner of speaking, of the Byzantine empire.      Greeks are not promoting hate but ever since ancient times we unite to defend against an aggressor (I don't want to say enemy because I don't believe that Greece sees the FYROM as an enemy but rather a misguided neighbor) and I don't see anything wrong with fighting false propaganda. The only reason the FYROM got so far is because of US backing because of Us interests. In fact the US Congress disagrees with the President's decisions to recognise the FYROM with their constitutional name.  US House of Representatives in 1361 resolution on Durban Revision Conference, unanimously adopted by the Plenum, refers to our neigbouring country as FYROM and not as "Republic of Macedonia. It is a first time that a unanimous decision of the US House of Representatives makes clear reference of the neighbouring countrys internationally recognized name. It should be reminded that the two bodies of US Congress-House of Representatives 356 resolution and the Senates 300 resolution  call FYROM to put a halt to its hostile and irredentist campaign against Greece and work constructively to produce a mutually acceptable solution to name issue.|`|24eKqnyqaa	The problem is simple. The Macedonians keep calling everything the way they like and this is pissing off the rest of the Greeks.   For example, they don't say "tyropita", they say "bugatsa me tyri".  They don't say "mou les", they say "me les".    Are you talking about the fyromians?|`|c696f477a4d1a069e6273b7aae58b19daa	They are trying to steal the name of a State in Greece..

The rights of Macedonians (F.Y.R.O.M.) are not recognised by the government and most of the population of Greece.  Nice example of government brainwash.  ( I hope I can say it. Greece is democratic?).|`|r7FdyeC5aa	Vardaska is actually Vardarska, and the wrong spelling usually comes from Greeks when they refer to Macedonia as Vardaska. Between the two world wars the present day Macedonia was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and was known as Vardarska banovina (banovina means a district). The Serbian policy from that time considered Macedonians as Southern Serbs. Today only hard line nationalists in Serbia keep on referring to us as Southern Serbs. The only remaining open question between Macedonia and Serbia today is the question of the Macedonian orthodox church, which Serbs consider to be part of the Serbian orthodox church. Just a reminder: when the division of ex Yugoslavia began in 1991, Macedonia was the only ex Yugoslav republic which was not involved in the war atrocities. Among other things, there are 4% Serbs living in Macedonia. The war atrocities mostly happened in places where there was a big Serbian minority. The war in Slovenia lasted 10 days before the then Yugoslav national army pulled out. In Croatia and Bosnia it lasted for several years. Without support among the local population the army pulled out from Macedonia without a single bulled being fired.    The Bulgarians are different story. Bulgaria is the first country in the world that recognized Republic of Macedonia. Interesting thing is that they recognized the state, but not the nation and the language as Macedonian. According to Bulgarians, Macedonian language is only a diallect of the Bulgarian language, and Macedonian nation is part of the Bulgarian nation i.e. Macedonians=Bulgarians. Similarity between Macedonian, Bulgarian (and Serbian) language comes from their origins. They were all developed from the glagolica alphabet invented by brothers Cyril and Methodius and they belong in the same group of languages (South Slav languages). Other than similarities, there are also differences between those languages, which makes them separate languages. It is non-sense to say that Bulgarian and Macedonian are the same language. It is like saying: Serbian and Croatian language are the same, or Croatian is only a diallect of Serbian language. Serbs and Croats understand each other much better, than Macedonians and Bulgarians do. Go to Croatia and say to a Croat that he speaks Serbian and see what happens.    From the answers here you can see what is the main problem between  Macedonians and Greeks. Well, one side of the story, which goes back to ancient times. Greeks deny Macedonia the right to use the name Macedonia. They also deny the existence of a separate Macedonian nation, or they equal Macedonians with Greeks. Macedonia is Greek. Consequently there is no Macedonian language and there is no Macedonian church. Then, what are we? Tito's invention of course. Brainwashed amorph population with no roots, fyromians and fakedonians. We claim Greek lands, we steal others nations history. Too much irony.  This is one of the rarest examples of the modern history where one nation completely denies the existance of another nation. Israelies are fighting with Palestinians, but they still call them Palestinians. Turks are fighting with Kurds, but they still call them Kurds. We are not fighting with Greeks, but they call us fakedonians.  The ancient history is not exclusively Greek. Nor is the Byzantine history. The process of forming the nations, in modern sense of the word, began after the French revolution. Greeks got their independence in 1821. Bulgaria and Serbia in the 19th century. Albania in 1912. Does that make us Macedonians inferior because we got independence in the 20th century? Not many nations are lucky to live in their own state. There are many open conflicts in the world based on the national issue. Many nations are denied having their own state. Greece denies the right of Macedonians to have its own state by denying our identity. Macedonia for us is more than just a word. That's who we are. We speak Macedonian language which is taught around the world on university level and is recognized as such - Macedonian language. We are recognized by more than 120 countries under the constitutional name as Republic of Macedonia. And the whole world addresses us as Macedonians, because that's who we are.  If, as other users here say, we are not Macedonians, then what are we? Serbs? Bulgarians? Albanians? Turks? Eskimos? Martians? Penguins?  My "brainwashed" mind says: we are Macedonians, nothing more, and nothing less.|`|YU471WSsaa	this is to PLATINUM..you dont have your facts right...FIRST OF ALL ...there is now country called MACEDON or MACEDONIA....this is the ISSUE..and untill people can comprehend this..us greeks will alwasy be at odds with the ridiculous calims...How ever there is  NOMOS in GREECE called "MAKEDONIA" and this nomos is the only one who has the right to be called MAKEDONIA and its residents with in the greek borders..and thew VERGAN  star OF makedonia was never alexander the greats..right .it was the makedonia tribe right of greece who where in fact of DORIAN stock that goes back in to antiquity the star its sefl has been an intriquit part of the tribe of makedons and a relegious one since  thier occupation of the area or nomus  with in the borders of greece... the word MAKEDONIA means   TALL PEOPLE.. in ancient greek  ....THE country now which which is called FYROM... and is reconized by the UN.. was and still is the region of a splinter group of southern slavs who settled in the area 900 years ago who where called  and are still called  VADRASKANS...but because we greeks let them settle there and because we educated them and taught them about the orthodox relegion and gave them  the CYRILLIC script as thier own THROGUH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH wich att he time was in CONSTANTNOPOLI..as the orthodox relegion att hat time was looking for converts was sending its own preachers in the form of now ST COSMAS and the ST  CYRILL...who the script is named after ..and was was not only apated by vadraskans but by bulgarians and yugoslavians and russians..where the SLAVS ORIGANLLY came from., and the fact that the turkish occupation happed in greece and all was lost for 400 years and the FACT that turks gave away property that belonged to greeks in the NOMO of MAKEDONIA .,  ...is some how...a claim for the vadraskans that the nomo was theres and all its history???????? and they DARE CALL THEM SELF MAKEDONIA ...they are slavs ...ALEXANDER THE GREAT SPOKE GREEK NOT SLAVIC.... even the turks called them VADRASKANS not MACEDONIANS as they claim...THE TRUTH IS THAT  CARTOGRAPHERS UNDER NOPOLEON WHERE SENT OUT TO MAKE MAPS OF THE BALKANS  as they never existed while they where making them  they  COINDED  a PSEDUO NATION TO THE WORLD NAMED ...MACEDONIA.....and to prove that the "C"   in macedonia..is french for the "K"  in the greek nomos of  MAKEDONIA....in simple terms there is no country called MACEDONIA  its only a nomos called MAKEDONIA in greeces borders encasing its greek roots from antiquity...  and trhe  vadraskans know this but are taking it for a ride and trying to milk greece of its history and its lands..on  a .world paltform playing out the down trodden..when in truth they are nothing but LIERS..and and ARE even refusing to be slavic YET THEY SPEAK SLAVIC ??  instead of beign with yugoslavia as one nation..they want to gain a country through lies and decit..i say tot he VADRASKAN  ....shows us your proof  where is your historical TOME???..we greeks have one..|`|S1uPEgbTaa	I have nothing more to add to what already some Greek users have said.    I just want to make a clarification for Macedon777.    Greeks don't deny your existance as a nation or a state.Greeks deny the name you use for this.    If you call yourself Macedonians,Sicilians,Cretans,Vikings or whatever doesn't mean you are just because you chose this name .    What you are is something you should look and find,don't ask here.  But just because you decided to use a name-which is associated with a history that you have no relation to, doesn't mean you are.    I can call my self Marylin Monroe,just because I don't have another name.Does this make me Marylin Monroe?the diva actor?No.    It doesn't mean that I don't exist, but doesn't mean that just because I claim that,makes me one,ok?    As for the question (If, as other users here say, we are not Macedonians, then what are we? Serbs? Bulgarians? Albanians? Turks? Eskimos? Martians? Penguins?) my personal opinion is :    Bulgarians mixed with Serbs and Albanians.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	As I understand it, the principal problem is that Macedonia today - either the Greek province or the former Yugoslav republic - is not the same as ancient Macedonia, so nobody quite knows what is meant by that name.    The Greeks maintain that, because ancient Macedonia was an intrinsic part of the Greek world, they should have the right to use of the name. They also apparently suspect that any country calling itself Macedonia intends, by definition, to include the province of Greece called Macedonia. They were alarmed when the FYR Macedonia used the star of Alexander the Great - king of Macedon - on their original flag, which they felt usurped a central part of their own Greek heritage. (A roughly analogous situation is the independence of Kosovo, which is seen by Serbs as you will know as central to the national consciousness of the Serbian people).    The Macedonians claim that their country is pretty much the same geographical area as ancient Macedon, give or take, and that because the south Slavs have lived there for 1400 years or more they should be entitled to use the name without prejudice to its Greek history. (A similar situation would be the use of the name "Egypt" by the current largely Arabic population of Egypt, although in that case there is no remaining Egyptian state to dispute the name).|`|LMo8HaA2aa	I don't imply anything, but a simple search at the resolved questions in Y!A would be enough for you to see how many and also informative questions are there about this issue.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

bTtAQ8Pgaa	CRISTIANIT  Dopo le grandi invasioni del IX e X secolo l'europa si stabilizz grazie all'impero bizantino, alla nascita di altri regni cristiani come Ungheria, Polonia,Bulgaria ,Principato di kiev. Nel medioevo, tuttavia non esisteva  l'europa se non in senso geografico . Era solo il concetto di Cristianit a riunire la comunit culturale e religiosa del continente.    LA POPOLAZIONE  La societ si basava sul sistema feudale costituito da una rete di rapporti di dependenza: il signore donava il feudo in beneficio in cambio di fedelt. Ma poi fin il feudalesimo e nacquero pian piano le signorie che erano autonome, quindi  i sovrani non avevano pi il controllo. Nei loro territori  i signori feudali dominavano sulle  popolazioni contadine e amministravano la guistizia.    LA POPOLAZIONE  Tra il 1000 e il 1300 si verific in Europa un imponente crescita demgrafica a causa di un insieme di fenomeni di   diversa natura come il miglioramento delle condizioni ecologiche,l a fine delle invasioni, il consolidamento del sistema feudale, la diminuzione della mortalit infantile  e, soprattutto, la possibilit da parte dei  servi di coltivare autonomamente la terra. L' aumento della mandopera (era aumentata la popolazione) port alla   bonifica di vaste regioni  fino allora occupate da foreste o da paludi.    IL PROCESSO DELLE TECNICHE  Agli inizi del XIII secolo la societa medievale era basata sull'agricoltura. Ci furono importanti miglioramenti nelle tecniche agrarie : impiego dall' aratro pesante,rotazione triennale delle colture, diffuzione del mulino ad acqua, maggiore produzione. I raccolti aumentarono ma ci  non provoc un considerevole miglioramento delle condizioni di vita dei contadini    LA RIPRESA DELL'URBANESIMO  L'incremento demografico e aumento della produttivit agricola stimolarono lo sviluppo urbano. La citt a sua volta esercit ma forte attrazione sulle campagne, diventando punto di riferimento dell' attivit agrocola e dando ai servi che vi si trasferivano, la possibilit di diventare operai o artigiani. Si accentu sempre di pi la divisione tra attivit rurali e attivit urbane.

Your husband can move anywhere within the E.E.C. and continue to claim disability benefit, you must inform the authorities because your claim is handle by the Overseas Benefit Office also they continue to check up on you, they employee local English or English speaking doctors to do this.  Does your husband claim Disability Living Allowance, if the answer is yes then he will probably lost this if you leave England, there is a cut of year of either 1991 or 1992 (not sure which) if he was claiming before he can continue whilst living abroad if his claim started later then he will lost it.    I spent four years living in Tenerife and I returned to England two years ago, my advice to you as one disabled to another "don't do it".    Dealing with all the paperwork is difficult, the medical side is a nightmare, being disabled you can forget private health insurance which means you will have to join the Spanish N.H.S.  first, they have a rule laid down by the Spanish Government that they can only deal with you in Spanish which means if you can't speak fluent Spanish you will have to employ and pay for a translator every time you visit the doctor or hospital and that can be expensive as you pay by the hour.   To register for medical care took me about six months to get all the required paperwork and when I left Tenerife all I had was a piece of paper to show that I was register I was and still am waiting for my medical card not that I want it now.  Many of the medical aids in Spain are provided by private companies for which you have to obtain a presciption from your doctor, if you fail to get a repeat prescription the company will demand the be returned of the equipment regardless of how important it is to the patient.  If you come back to England for a holiday you are only then entitled to accident and emergency medical cover because you will no longer be registered with the UK N.H.S.    My dream of living in Tenerife was shattered by having to deal with the medical side of my life there, I'm glad I tried but I even more glad to return to England to a system that I understand and can deal with.    Foot note:- With the Governments intend new system to record the all details of those who enter and and leave the country the days are number for those who cheat the system and live overseas without declaring the fact.
b5ySK6SGaa	If your going for power mods. Larger intake and exhausts will give you more top end power (More power in higher rev range). Narrow intake gives good power low down for slow driving. Large exhaust improves top end allowing the tons of gases to escape more freely.  More expensive mods would be turbo kits and complete race prepping including porting and crack testing, and high performance cam shafts, value springs and lifters etc.    For body mods check out local catalogues and go see a body shop and they'll point you in the right direction.

Y5qIP5kPaa	of course  use this one :  http://www.egyptair.com/English/Pages/sp...      ---edit to MR. S down bellow  Actually most of the time from USA ( Egyptians are not the passengers,,, it is more cheaper to take KLM if there is a stop in between ,, so most Egyptians prefer to use -one stop -flight to pay less...It is only a small info to the answerer bellow me,,,Although I am not with him in the hygiene thing,, the only problem with the  Egyptians passengers coming from USA ,using KLM , (and that is why I do not use KLM) is that they have lots of children with them (family trips always) and I can not sleep that much during the flight..and I do not like Delta  the crew remind me of the  bus's crew,,     (lived in USA Fl  for 4 years),,  --------------  Ok , S  i tried to be civilized but you started your cowboy heroism like usual with you people,, is it the curse of Ham that you justify your racism with??,,, You see   Mr, American , I have not meet in my life worse in smell than you Americans,, Of course you know what you eat.. the junk food that turns most of you...(you know  to what)... and the ugly smell of Alcohol coming from the mouth,, that I throw up when I talk closer to you people... And the worst who are living and working in Egypt... they are inferior and could not survive in USA that they have to come here to be able to live and feel superior on some kind people ,,and they are no one over  there ,at home... sorry,, You know I am telling the truth, especially I have lots of friends from You in maadie and your club in Port saed street there... And when you are transferred back home you cry and cry to leave here where you are treated way better than in Your country,, Now, a friend of mine who is an American was crying every night  because she was traveling with Britons on board who looked to her down  that she wanted to jump to the Nile ,,as all the Europeans do with you,,,You know of course that,,, Now while it is discovered that you have 2 million crooks who took banks money and can not pay their homes there, and the more than 600000 person who are jobless and ask for help,, your country is asking to suck some Arabic blood to survive,,, sorry it is the fact,,,   By the way I was not in USA to work and use your people, I was making money for  them... and I preferred to leave to more civilized people in Europe , as I was fed up with no culture people there,,, Our zoo, is older than your country, and if you have your days, there is no big difference between you and the Arabs who you insult everyday,, you are cow boys and they are sheep boys and if you are rich because your wealth of  raw material  (and actually you do not work , just live in Chinese products)to attract immigrants,,  they are also rich to hire people like you...I am sorry again,, I stick to what I said,,, You smell bad physically (because what you eat and drink) and morally...(because a fake superiority, and fake culture)  ---  As for the tickets  Salam habibi  ==========  Return ticket By Egypt air from New york to Cairo and back   1100 USD  Return ticket by KLM from Newyork to Caio and back is 1019 USD    http://www.klm.com/travel/klm_splash/spl...  The difference is that KLM flies from more than one departure city  so it is always cheaper than Egypt air...(but not direct flight....)    Check the web sites,, and you will find that KLM is cheaper always than Egypt air,,, as it has a stop... so do not talk what you do not know.(.hahah  American Efta,.You are the experts   ahahaha ..like always).  Shalom|`|7bnQmXksaa	EDIT to Fed up Zoser     COME ON .. Are you serious,    1 KLM IS NOT THE CHEAPEST NO matter how many stops they make!!      2 EGYPT AIR HAS ALMOST 60% Egyptians  on every flight I have flown .I have flown them 8 times and sometimes with more then 20 coworkers and their family . All of them would agree with what I said. You also mentioned they bring their families. So in one sentence you say they are not on the flights and then you say they bring their families.     Slow down what does that even mean  someone asked for help and you are not being honest or you have not flown enough to know how right I am. Either way no hard feeling I forgive you .      You don't agree with the hygiene thing. Come one be honest its not fair not to be. I read your comments to 9 co workers 3 Americans 4 from UK and 2 from Ireland and they laughed at you . They  actually all  flew coach Egypt air and think your comments are silly. All agreed the smell was horrible. I did not mean to hurt your feelings I am sure you are fresh and minty I am only saying the coach cabin is not .    HERE IS MY ORIGINAL ANSWER I AM STICKING TO IT  I am in Egypt all the time, I am an American and I do consulting in Egypt in the last 8 years I have been there 16 times. In fact I am typing this from one of my offices there as you read this. Here are the best choices. I only fly business so I'm not sure about coach. But here is what I know for sure . Check a few sites to see the average price. however I am sure Egypt Air and Delta are the cheapest as of Oct. I came in Aug until Sept on delta and then I came again in OCT and both times Delta was cheapest by far.     1. If you want business class take  Delta (I  have taken it 9 times) and it  is the least expensive AND THE FOOD IS MUCH BETTER!!!  It is only one of 2 carriers that fly direct from JFK to EGYPT ALL OTHER STOP IN EUROPE 1 or 2 TIMES.  2. Egypt air is cheap and I have taken 7 times  it will also fly direct but the food SUCKS....By sucks I mean REALLY SUCKS, you can get a green red yellow fish cake thingy or some other horrible meat thing with brown sauce. The food is Really bad.  the service is so so depending on who is on the flight  and there is no ALCOHOL .. But in general the staff is nice.     If you  fly coach, Do not take Egypt air. The passengers are mostly Egyptian and they do not have the same hygiene Habits I'M NOT BEING RACIST as the love of my life is Egyptian and I am marrying her.HOWEVER . 75 to 85% of them Smell bad. Its the few hundred million that ruined it for the other nice smelling 5, Look at it this way  12 hours in coach the entire section smells like armpits and funk and its gross and it will make you vomit. Not that all Americans smell fresh and minty however All my flights in my life and its way over 50 Egypt air BY FAR SMELLS THE WORST IN COACH. I went to  check on a co worker 5 hours into the flight in coach and it was horrible.     IF YOU WANT COACH     THE CHEAPEST WAY TO FLY IS THE FOLLOWING    1. Go to The Airlines web sight and price it out  2. Then call DIRECT takes longer but you will be happy you did.     You will for sure get some better prices on their web site or calling your self. If you need a good whole sale company  e mail me direct and I will give you the best places to call for flights and the best places to call for hotels.   Last time i posted phone numbers I got thumbs down but if you need hotels or cheap air lines coach included  and cant find them on your own  or cant find what you need I will be happy to help I am an expert on Egypt and travel and hotels there . I can connect you to the companies I use and for sure you will get the best rates. e mail me If you cant find what you are looking for     good luck|`|AA10956234	This website is great for giving you all the ways and flights to choose from, also u can book through it,  http://www.amadeus.net/plnext/meb/HomePa...

q9PVawNyaa	No. The paramilitaries certainly weren't victims and letting them think they were only makes them feel more justified in what they did.|`|AA11984132	Yes everybody in the North of Ireland and indeed in the Republic of Ireland were victims of the troubles. Why? because at the time of the Partition of the country, and indeed today, many people in power in the U.K. Government, particularly in the Conservative party, have used, and are using the North of Ireland to suit their own purposes.The people of the North of Ireland were of no use to the Powers that be in London, however the Industries such as shipbuilding, and the ports around the coast were.|`|UkaBy2Hyaa	Considering the size of NI's population, the number of people affected by the troubles both mentally and physically was massive.  Maybe only (and I use that word extremely loosely) 3500+ people lost their lives but 10,000s more have suffered horrific disabling injuries 10,000 more have suffered with their mental health as well.      People who lived in working class areas and hot spots (such as Derry City, South Armagh etc) suffered hugely but that doesn't take away from the fact that nearly everyone who grew up in the bad decades of the troubles (70s, 80, and the 1st half of the 90s) in NI will in some way have experienced victimhood.    Does that mean that everyone who was involved in the trouble was a victim?    IMHO No.      There were those who used the troubles purely to propheteer and for personal gain (both monetarily and to push an agenda) but that being said I think it would be foolish to pretend that anyone who was involved in the paramilitaries or state terrorism and collusion was not a victim by fact of their actions.  Generally speaking people dont go out to join groups like the UDA or IRA and commit acts of terror on a whim.  Theyre the result of an injustice or perceived injustice which has happened to them.  Its how violence in the north has been perpetuated for the guts of 4 decades.    I in absolutely in no way condone any of the violence which happened in the north, from whichever side it came but bigots like Willie Frazier  dont just wake up one day and decide to be bigots.  In Willies case he lost his father and most of his uncles to the PIRA. He might be a bigot but hes still a victim.    On the other side youve got people like the UVF drug lords whove make a fortune from the troubles and people like Slab Murphy (A high ranking Provo who was found with black bags full of money earlier last year) its hard to see how people like that are victims.
kZ8jIStBaa	You have really hit where it hurts. The agenda of manipulation and sanitation of history, arts, literature and political science has been continuing ever since Communists grabbed power in China. Sometimes they manipulated the events and sometimes they offered a different interpretation that suited the communist ideology.    After coming to power in 1949, the Communist gradually nationalized the publishing industry, centralized the book distribution system, and brought writers under institutional control through the Writers Union. A system of strict censorship was implemented, with Mao's "Yan'an Talks" as the guiding force. Periodic literary campaigns (e.g., against Hu Shi, Hu Feng () targeted certain literary figures who did not toe the Party line on literature. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_lit...    With the Communist takeover in 1949, the government saw motion pictures as an important mass production art form and tool for propaganda. Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films and Hollywood and Hong Kong productions were banned as the Communist Party of China sought to tighten control over mass media.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Cin...    Even today these tough measures on humanitarian sciences continue. It has been reported that every cinematographer has to submit the script of movie for approval before starting production. A communist party official keeps supervising the movie at every stage of production. While I am talking of movies let's see an interesting link: "Hero:A Distortion of History" http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2004/09/her...    "While Zhang Yimous Hero is number one at the American box office, Li Yongyan of Asia Times explains how the movie distorts Chinese history to present a politically correct conclusion. Many American reviewers who have given the movie high marks for choreography and cinematography have largely missed its political overtones, which were loudly debated on Internet chat rooms when the movie was released in China two years ago. The movie won the approval of the government, as the premiere was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and the movie was Chinas official Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film in 2003. Zhang Yimou recently directed the China section of the closing ceremony at the Athens Olympics.    Li writes how Zhang twists the legend of the hero/assassin who risks his life to take out the brutal Emperor: Instead of an explosive ending in which the assassination attempt is thwarted either by a dogged detective or a vigilant emperor, Zhang has the hero give up at the last second The emperor then launches into a lecture on the importance of his life to mankind"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(2002_...    History is freely manipulated to suit the agenda of the Communists. They go on distorting the history of other neighboring nations as well to stake claim over other's land. Just see what Korea has to say about all this.   http://www.itcenglish.com/data_files/pro...  http://www.itcenglish.com/data_files/aca...    I don't know how to quantify the extent of control, but we can safely say that they are effectively lying, the worst type of lie. They think that speaking a lie thousand time will make it truth. How sad !!|`|MR4WwKoZaa	All countries do this.  I am not saying it's alright, but I am saying it's not fair to target China as if it's the only perpetrator.|`|gWleYSuIaa	Yes they do.  The control is as complete as they can make it.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	show me the country where the history isn't "controlled"...    some "top secret materials"...   some cases "to be revealed a hundred years after..."    perhaps i know such one and the only country, it's Vatican...    all others, including yours (which is not indicated but still) always control not only humanities as History and Politics, but also Law, Medicine, Technology, Media and many other aspects of people's life...    China is a modern and civilized country, highly valued all over the world...|`|BrjyljGIaa	Well, of course they do.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	They control everything and if I give you a link in support of my claim someone will pop up calling it a biased report. They have rewritten history to suit their own narrow agenda. All literature has to conform to the Communist guidelines. Movies are shot under the supervision of Communist officials. They have the ultimate say on everything.
Lx6TXgHKaa	It's because they believed that they could not control people's mind without wiping out the history. It has happened before as one of the answerer has told. Christians wiped out the history of Pagans and other earth based religions. They persecuted the practitioners. But it was more than one thousand year ago. The civilized world today does not practice such things, nor does it forgive them. Communists had no right to write the history that suited their purpose while obliterating other portions.    Maybe once China gets rid of the communist rule, intellectuals will research and correct the mistakes. People who play with history are never forgiven by the history as time will surely tell.|`|asaLj4BTaa	what have been wiped out? most people went through this section of history are alive by now, so it cant be wiped out at all. you are so astonished about it, i think, because you just heared about it.

Look at how the Christians destroyed pagan temples and art.  Look at how the Taliban wiped out the Buddhist and other artwork in Afghanistan.  It is a shame, though.  Chairman Mao is still very, very popular here in China.  I, for one, have a hard time forgiving him.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	those objects of Chinese historical value were destroyed by Chinese people...     as far as they were Chiense people and destroyed Chinese objects, they had the total right to destroy thir own property...    it makes no difference, will you forgive or not because, as a matter of fact, nobody asks you to do that...|`|kZ8jIStBaa	History is something that we preserve for our future generations.

The head of municipe would be something like the STATE CAPITAL in the US, Guatemala is so small that it is divided in departments and each department has a head of municipe which is the most important town (cause they can not be consider citys).|`|xiMnj4f4aa	The previous answer is wrong.  Tikal was once a Mayan settlement, but now it is a National Park.  Asking what city it is in, would be like asking what city Yellowstone is in.  The park is located in the department of El Peten.  A Guatemalan department is like a state.  The closest modern cities are Flores and Santa Elena, together just referred to as Flores.  The closest airport is the Flores Airport.
X6rFPI2laa	You're doing fine!  If you can ride English you can ride Western, and the difference in saddle will basically make that transition for you.  But don't post -- it will confuse the horse!  When you get to a ranch, I think you will find that you will NOT be riding bareback at all, but have a regular Western saddle.  And you will certainly not be riding without reins!   The only hint I have is not to let the stirrups be too short for you!  Sometimes people want the stirrups longer because it can be easier to mount, but then the stirrups are too short for riding.  Have fun!|`|UzSaTblgaa	Western style uses stirrups and reins!  You will do fine, it's a more relaxed style - a loose seat, if you will.  You relax your back and sit solidly in the saddle, it's all about balance.  You can post a bit in a trot but not as formally as english style.  Watch some American cowboy movies!
AA10250756	Ormond Beach near Daytona is known for its schools. In addition, in Tampa, if you are in the Plant High School District in Tampa you are in an excellent school district with a high school that sends students to Ivy League colleges and safe neighborhoods. You can walk to little stores in Hyde Park which is part of the Plant High School district.|`|UzSaTblgaa	I'd choose Ft. Lauderdale.  Schools are pretty good (none in FL are great), weather is nice, city not too crowded, good place for kids.|`|OORYD6rUaa	There are many great places, but I favor Safety Harbor/Palm Harbor/ Dunedin areas.  This is part of Tampa Bay, across the bay from Tampa in the northern part of Pinellas County.    The schools here are great and it is much more family oriented than most of Tampa proper.  You are also close to beaches, and crime rates are lower than most areas.  All 3 places have nice re-developed, small quaint downtowns with festivals and events, and Dunedin and Safety Harbor have big city access with small town feel|`|aH5CGP4Faa	St Augustine is incredibly family friendly, with some of the best schools in Florida, so many events and free activities for children. It's a popular tourist destination but also has a small town feel. You're right on the Atlantic, some truly gorgeous beaches. Crime rate is very low. I grew up in Central Florida and it was nice to be near Disney but there wasn't much else to do there.

rvTcDJ6yaa	I had 3 nights in Rome, 3 in Florence and 2 in Venice.   Venice is a small place.. a lot smaller than I thought and you can easily get around it in a day. I found less to do on the sightseeing front than the other places as the main point of interests are the san marco square...the bascialla/duomo is ok ( i remember it was cold inside and gold!) and the Doges palace was quite cool. THe Rialtro bridgehas a good market next to it to buy some cheap glassware....not sure of the origin of it, but its cheaper than official stuff!. Apart from that there is a museum..i didn't go as I was museumed out at that point and some churches. THe Murano glass factory is supposed to be good, but I think you need a day to enjoy that..not sure ( try www.viator.com for day tours)    Rome has quite a bit to offer....i liked the vatican, some of the roman things like the roman forum and pantheon. Trevi fountain is nice, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the spanish steps...they did not look like the pictures...anyway a few churches and other things. I did a day tour to Pompeii which was great and can totally recommend, but you might be cutting it short for time.    Florence is pretty and has quite a few things to see...just meandering the streets is nice but you have to avoid the people...there were LOTS of people there when I went ( near easter) but I think maybe its like that all the time.  From florence its about an hour to Pisa....there is not much else in pisa than the tower but that is worth seeing as it really is leaning!  I also did a trip to a town called Lucca which is lovely and also about an hour away by train. THere are less people there and its nice to escape the hoards.    I had varied accommodation in Rome...I was trying all sorts as a test.  I had a hostel and a hotel in Venice ( tryin a hostel for the first time.. good to meet people and had a good location but i got bitten in the bed and didnt like sharing with others)..then had a nice little hotel called hotel messiner which was reasonably priced compared to other places ....i had a nice view over a canal from my room which was at the end of the corrodor ( right above the noisy kitchen! but when it closed it was good..no elevator either)venice and florence were quite expensive for accommodation from memory.   In Rome I had a 4 star place but it was a long way from the centre and i had only book 2 nights so i got a new place close to the train station ( which is where I booked it from) and while it was a small room it was nice.  In Florence I stayed in a campground/cabins place out of the city which was heaps cheaper than in the city and bus was cheap...despite a 50min bus ride to and from florence. so can't help you there as i don't think that what you want.  Can't help you with food either as I ate ( with some people I hooked up with) at the resteraunt at the campground.  BUT lots to see  in florence..lovely duomo, david statue is impressive! ( there are 2 replicas in the  city, one where the origianal was for a few hundred years and one overlooking the city on the other side of the river at a lookout ( the double decker bus is a good way to see the city sights and it takes you there)  Anyway hope it helps.|`|LrGhFAkkaa	You are going to some wonderful places :-) I went to Florence in the summer of 2007 and it is a compact city so you can cover most of it on foot.

What's wrong with giving it seven more years?|`|4e18c82089d9eecf334053f6edf2d156aa	i think you already know the answer. you just need somebody to back you up a bit.    stick with your instincts....    RUN!!!!!!|`|Uaobd0ODaa	Asian people, especially from countries like the Philippines, have a different attitude to marriage and relationships than western people. They like to get married young and have children. They go about it in a much more business like way, like a business arrangement. She's got the looks/body, you've got the social standing and money, or earning potential. They also see white western men as a good catch and a way of moving up the social ladder, especially as if you're rich.   Love isn't seen as an essential ingredient in for a good marriage.   She may be using sex to get your attention and to encourage you to marry her.   So just b/c she wants to marry you it doesn't mean she loves you. On the other hand it doesnt mean she doesn't love you. Intercultural marriages are difficult and often end in divorce. If you're serious you need to learn about her culture first and even a bit of her language. Asian women are often looking for more freedom and equality when they marry western men. Western men are often looking for a submissive, obedient girl when they marry Asian girls. Usually both are happy in the beginning but as time goes on both become less satisfied.   Asian girls can be quite crafty and are good at hustling. They can often see if a guy is naive and take advantage of that and u do sound a little naive, at 18 most guys are. You should be careful. She might be the domineering type. I would try and get a bit more life experience before you think about settling down, and learn how to have more strength of mind and self determination.|`|T6v3RWixaa	Just a warning:  When you marry a Filipina, you also marry the whole family and clan..... just what my husband used to tell me, that he married the whole family.      Edit:  Let me speak as a mother to a son:  You are still so young  to settle down.  Enjoy life first, see the world, it is never too late  for a man to settle down.|`|0HczsxDGaa	Actually as a rule Filipino families like the idea of their women having white men's babies. As a half Filipino/White baby is considered as more attractive, and "superior", in the Philippines. Honestly, no criticism for this please, this is true, alot of Filipinos still have a very colonial attitude. So, from that point of view you'll probably become accepted by most of her family sooner or later. Also, they do say if you marry a Filipino girl then you marry her family. Filipinas are generally very intelligent and well-educated women. They do also look to white guys often because their men don't treat them particularly well, they are free to cheat on their wives and some even beat them. However, without knowing the girl it is impossible to know her intentions. She may very well be genuine, however, she may not. There are those that will scam you, and there are those that really do want love. My advice to you would be to take a little more time, maybe a year, just because she moves fast doesn't mean you have to. Explain this to her and if she doesn't like it then perhaps she isn't right for you. If she understands your concerns then she may well be genuine. Just remember you're only 18 and you have your whole life ahead of you, don't feel pressured into doing anything you aren't comfortable with. I really hope it does work out for you though, Filipinas are incredibly beautiful women, and the nice/genuine ones would probably make the ideal partner for any man.    EDIT. The men that will get scammed are more likely to be the older ones who go for the beautiful young Filipinas, and are basically looking for her to 'serve' them. So, basically what do they expect.|`|50be9e4c464acb11ea076cabb1b56f26aa	Watch out. Don't be caught in the bird trap.  Most fast paced commitments are dirty low schemes.  Filipina's are very attractive and if her family is poor,be careful.  If you understood the native language, you would know her true motives.    Be patient and watch the truth about her unfold.|`|kFq62tBpaa	it's up to you to decide on that matter coz that is serious.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	Its just hormones kicking.  The only way your going to win the love and affection of her family is with cash, and plenty of it.  Do you think your story is new?  There is an ongoing, unofficial, national campaign among filipinos to get all the white foreigners out of their country and out of their lives.  They call that filipino pride.  What it really means is filipino racism.  They did it to Marcos and look what followed.  I'm done.|`|QJpmEV6Baa	Whatever her nationality, you are far too young to be commiting to anyone.  You have a long time to live and you have many experiences that you should enjoy. You don't sound like you want to commit to her. Your intuition ( gut feeling ) is telling you that you are right not to want to settle with anyone right now. Dont do it. In time you will find the one you really want to be with and if it is this female than you will both be togther and be happy about all aspects of your now and the past.  Please dont let anyone rush you into something that you will regret later. What is her hurry? you need to ask yourself this question. Good luck :)|`|e9gsf1GJaa	hahaha, right.  if shes like not filipinoized anymore then, its whatever.  not everybody is a fob.|`|iw4BBRxgaa	Right mate, im speaking as a filipino who has grown up overseas (i moved here to New Zealand when I was 2 and am now 15)    This girl is they type of filipino that sort of pisses me off and makes me ashamed. Your 18, theres no need to talk about forever or crap like that. I dont want to offend people and I dont want to piss anyone off here but this girl sounds like they type of filipino that is poor and unclassy and desperate and above all, IMMATURE. She doesnt sound GENUINE.    im sorry that you had to meet a filipino like this, it gives us the wrong public image and really annoys me. not all filipinos (even the ones in the philippines) are stupid, naive, cant speak english and desperate like this.    and overall, hello...you're 18! why the hell are you even thinking of settling down?
oLhAi73caa	I slipped over on the way to work yesterday, it hurt a lot especially since Im 5 months pregnant.     People were really nice actually, I had several business men pick me up off the floor instantly (surprising!!!), they checked I was ok, and offered to accompany me to the nearest hospital.     But I was ok! - Im wearing snow boots now, until the ice disappears!     :D|`|wmBK9uASaa	No and no....|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	Nope i haven't slipped yet just sliding on the ice. My brother fell over twice though he tried walking down a slope and as soon as he got up after the 1st time fell over again hehe.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I did on the way to uni and when I stood up it really hurt so I just turned straight back round and walked home (past an old lady who was having no prblem walking at all - embarassing!). So I've been too scared to go out much since then and it's a 30m walk to uni when I'm rushing so it would take me over an hour to get there at the speed I can walk on ice/snow and no buses were running today.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	OMG!  I feel so sorry for your boyfriend and your dad!    I slipped and fell on Monday ... I live in a gated development and by the gate there are steps with tiles on them, and nothing to hold onto, so I went flat on my ****.  No-one saw me so they couldn't laugh, or help.  It really hurt though!  Also today, I have to walk across a large carpark to get to my station and whilst most of the pavements have now cleared, this carpark was like an ice rink ... I made sure to walk very slowly!  I did slip but didn't fall.    One of my colleagues also slipped.  I don't know the details but she had to take two days off work with a bruised ****.  She is nearly 60 so I can imagine it wasn't fun.    I also saw a man fall on all the slush that had been walked into the train station, and I'm pleased to say that about three people rushed over to him to help!|`|FwhwN5tnaa	Lol, I nearly did.  But I'd fall over if the ground was dry.    But I heard about a 16-year-old girl who died from sledging.  She fell in to a barbed wire fence.  But she was doing it at night, using a old roof of a car.|`|QxzR0VC8aa	yes i did outside of my school and it was just really funny, my friends laughed then helped me up :)|`|mXS3ZpPHaa	I Slippeed !

We picked snow up and threw it at each other. No ice. Then some 18 year olds came along with buckets of ice and started to throw them at us. We obviosuly ducked several times. Then after we took several blows, we was 10minutes from school when we thought we lost them. They came back this time with bikes and we moved out the way to let them through. Aiimee tried to dodge them but fell to the floor in the middle of the road. She couldnt get up. I tried to help her but everytime we got her up she fell back down. When we finally got her back up a car was close approaching trying to brake, but we knew he wasnt going to stop. Aiimee pushed me out the way and got hit by the car. She died aged 16.    R.I.P Aiimee Louise Clark :'( 2/1/93- 27/1/2009...   I will always miss you :'(|`|PaZosnMPaa	how could your boyfriend break his ribs then that would be a critical matter and he should be in hospital , no i have not fallen yet cause i walk wisely =]|`|Y7ksupZZaa	lool aww dear!    hehehe i fell today because we me and my boyfriend had to walk dwn a slopey hill and we had to run dow the hill as we couldnt stop ourselves because our shoes had no grip lol.   once u start moving on the ice u cant stopp! and we both went flying and he landed on top of me lol was hilarious. it happened to everyone there. lol noone could prevent themselves from falling hehehehehehe.  alsoooo he made a snowball and tried throwing it on me full pace and he fell on his bum for putting the strength in lo. i didnt even do anything hehe. fun dayy. love the snow. but the bad thing is the cars are uncontrolable on ice lol. the cars were skiddin on ice and getting stuck. dont u jus love snowwww =D|`|JjpSrQBsaa	painfull. no. yes. driveway.|`|iaHM24Xjaa	Walking to school today!

pTLcvsVfaa	If you get a party bus, they wont even care how old you are. As long as the person renting it is 21, you can have other people on it drinking. Not legally of course, but they are not going to stop you.    Just google NYC limos/charters and you will get so many companies that pop up. Call a few and see what offer.
NK3VJgiRaa	Hoe Long will you be there? You can go site seeing. There are lots of beautiful & historic sites in Old San Juan. El Morro Fort is amazing. You can walk la Paseo Princesa, see the govenors palace & the San Juan Cathedral & more. San Juan also has tons of nightlife, restaurants, shopping & casinos to keep you busy. If you are over 18 you can go to the Bacardi Factory Tour in Catano. You take a ferry from San Juan. San Juan has beaches too. Isla Verde is probably the best in the city. Of course outside of San Juan there are better beaches, but you would need a car rental. But if you do decide to rent a car, then you should also go to El Yunque rain forest & swim in la mina falls. & also check out the Arecibo telescope or Camuy Caves.

gXJdryRNaa	I personally like Chicago better.  I have been to all 3 cities and just had a better time there.      Los Angeles is massive in size and you must drrrrriiiiiivvvvveeee like crazy to get anywhere.  They also have earthquakes, Santa Ana winds, torrential rains, mudslides and smog.      New York City is a beautiful city to visit.  But I have an aunt who has lived there for 30 years.  She loves living there but she does admit that most of her lifestyle consists of a 600 sq apartment, sailing, and of course Broadway.  She says she does not usually eat at home unless she buys all of her ingredients fresh and normally eats out.  She also states that she walks everywhere or takes a cab and owning a car there just isn't worth it.    About the only issue I personally have ever had in Chi town is the airport.  Flights are almost always late and the airport is like its own miniature city.   I have never gotten bored in Chicago when visiting and always look forward to going back to visit friends and see the sights.    BTW, I am not from any of these places but have visited all 3.  I just prefer Chicago.|`|32Ftg0Ceaa	la for sure|`|dqxW1W0eaa	I would like to visit New York and check out Madison Square Garden/Gleason's Gym/Empire/Hudson River/Broadway Theatre/and all the historical places.Get a stack of them I Love New York tee shirts then come on back home to my little lake place here in Florida where I belong---home sweet home.....................!|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Chicago I've never been there.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	New York personally, but I would like to see Chicago and I live very close to Los Angeles, which is a nice city to visit (not so much fun to live in)|`|LaczJGJ7aa	Los Angeles California!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me2oJOtAaa	Kol ha k'vod lekhah Ariel ! you said exactly what ive been thinking for a long time now !     Yes - many people here talk out of thier arses. They see the news, believe it then some how imagine that they know everything there is to know about the situation.     The pro palastinian supporters are the worst for this. They talk about the the conditions palastinians have to endure without once having spent a night in an israeli bunker because rockets have been fired from hamas onto israeli civilians...     As i keep on saying. The Gaza conflict for many just an excuse to publically hate on Jews and israelis and say the most horrific things when normally thier views would have negative consequences for them.     It seems anti semitism is only not ok when Israel isnt defending itself. As soon as it retaliates against hamas suddenly jews/ israelis/ zionist whatever are a single entity all as equaly responsible for the death of palastinians as the israeli government itself.    The people who so vehemently support Palastine and cry '' justice '' and '' human rights'' if israel so much as blinks  - you will notice are very silent when it comes to Afghnistan, Sudan or the famine in Eithopia....     thats because human rights and justice are only fun slogans when theres a way to rant against jews in the process...     Most people here are ignorant... they have no idea what its like to hear a bomb go off let alone see the blood of children on the road or the screams of mothers watching as the bloody body parts of their dead children are picked off the road....     And for the record,     I lived in israel for 2 years at the beggining of the Intefada, AND i was on the teyeled when the dolphinarium night club blew up. i heard the bomb go  off and I saw the carnage minutes after it happened.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	I did not live in palestine, but my father did ( only for 6 years) and later on he visited Palestine a couple of times, and he told me about the good and bad things that happened to him there.    also my grandfather is a palestinian that used to live in palestine.  and I have lots of Palestinian friends, and I've heard lots of real stories from people that've actually live/d there.    If I had the chance to go to palestine  I won't hesitate for a moment..i want to go there..and find more about the truth, I try not to rely so much on the media but yes certainly to some extend it has some affect on me ( and i'm pretty sure it's the same thing for the pro-israelis) btw not everything that the media shows is considered lies or exaggerations .    too bad that most of the Palestinians that actually live in palestine, either don't have time to participate here or don't have access to the internet.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	to answer you, no I dont believe anything they say, as they dont know what they are talking about, they are either ignorant, or brainwashed into hating Israel.and dont even know where Israel is on the map.Most of them dont have anything nice to say about Israel and we all know, that Israel is a great place with lots to do and see.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	I notice the same thing. A lot of people here never been to Israel like I have. I don't know why some people are concerned about the conflict if they don't live there or don't know any friends or loved ones that live there.|`|qzsDSsoWaa	Hi Arieh,  I'm not Palestinian as you all know, i'm an American Arab from Lebanese roots, As an Arab I feel that Palestine belongs to me and to all believers in REAL peace, not in Zionist peace.  I'm very updated about what's happening their and as I mentioned in a previous answer I will be in Gaza If -GOD wants- the 16th February, because I still believe that Jews, Christians and Muslims can live together like before without the Zionist umbrella.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	I think you might want to be careful about what you wish for. If you silence the voices of everyone in the U.S., Canada and certain parts of Europe based on the fact that they've never been to Israel, odds are that there would be zero support left for Israel.     Would you also want to silence the voices of U.S. Congressmen and Senators who've never been to Israel when they vote for or against giving aid to Israel because citizens here who also have never been to Israel wrote to them and asked that they support Israel?     By the way, I have been to Israel and I hope to visit again some day.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	It is indeed a challenge to understand the reality from what the media portray.    However, I find it is possible to get some reliable information from history books.  I also research to find which sources are most reliable, and what they are best at.  A variety of sources with different biases is a good idea.  Even living in Israel or Gaza or West Bank, you can't always know what's going on.  You know what's happening in your neighborhood (to an extent) but it can be hard to get the big picture.    This is where communication can be helpful.  Yes, I would certainly like to visit Israel and Gaza and West Bank and Jordan and Iran and Iraq and a lot of other fascinating places, but I can't right now.  Some of those places might not even be too safe; that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to see them, though.|`|wVNwoEfCaa	Arieh, if it wasn't for the fact that I have a very small child who needs me, and who I could not bear to see in danger, I would have gone to Gaza a long time ago to help these people as much as I could.  I also want to see Israel, as I have nothing against the Jewish people, just their governmentt and it's murderous tactics.  I hope one day to be able to go and help my Palestinian brothers and sisters.|`|AA11295048	Astronomers have never been to a star or another planet are they credible? Being there does not automatically make one credible, people still tell lies. And offend times things are not what they appear to be. What is evident is that one side wants to live and the other would rather die killing the other side.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	I don't feel I need to see Israel to understand her plight.  Or to be in support of the people there.  If I came there which I do intend, would the few Israelis that might give me time inform me of the entire national view?  No.  No more than the few I meet here.  Would touring the Christian sites bring me closer to the Jew?  I think not.  You are too harsh a critic.  You certainly aren't authorized or qualified to decide who should come here and who shouldn't.  Judge yourself first.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	No, I certainly do not.    Many of these same people also claim that particular nationality while having never set foot there.|`|5oSnj1eTaa	I just hate to spend 3 to 4 hours in your airport being investigated by an illiterate guard my friend.  No I don't care about your "security"   You should have set better living rules to the Palestinian people if the Jews wanted peace.  I prefer to give my hard earned money to the Italians or the greeks.  At least these people say "please" or "hello" when you meet them.  Greetings|`|xnU7v2Oxaa	You joke, I laugh.   That's the deal, yesssss?  I made once the mistake to trust my money and vacation to the jews and the first thing they did was to cheat me, Arieheheh!  Six hundread Dead American Presidents!  Gone!  How would you feel if someone would steal from you the cash for which you stayed working over-time each night, for two whole months?  No dooode, the jews are too much in love with money.  Do you know by any chance how much they ask for a bottle of mineral water?  No I am not going to tell you because you'll think I am kidding here.  So, no IIsrael for me, mama mia!|`|t58rc9tCaa	I think that would characterize most of the people here. Have you ever met a Libyan who had never even seen a Jew in her life, yet hated Jews? It's a phenomenon.    Edit - Bravo Sierra is referring to the peace that would come with Muslim rule - I'm the ruler, you're the dhimmi, you agree to my conditions and you can live in peace with me. Palestinians are extremely fanatical Muslims, and there is no doubt that were there a one state solution, the demographic majority would vote an Islamic state into power. Bravo Sierra seems quite uninformed of the fact that under the Zionist peace, Arab Christians and Druze and Ahmadis and Bahais and Hindu immigrants and atheists live side by side with Jews of all sects. 51% of Israel's Jewish population is of Arab/Mizrahi origin, a million Jews who were thrown out of Arab lands from the 1940s to the 1970s. Israel is the only country where the number of Arab Christians has actually grown, from 30,000 in 1948 to over 130,000 today. In all Arab countries, including Lebanon, the percentage of Christians has been dwindling for decades. The Druze, Ahmadis and Bahais are all former Muslim sects who are savagely persecuted in Muslim countries. Bahais are actually very mistrusted by Muslims because they are allowed to have their religious headquarters, the House of Wisdom, in Haifa, Israel! Under Islamic rule, there is dominance and non-Muslims live as second-class citizens or "dhimmis" with much more limited rights and powers than Muslims. Under the secular "Zionist peace," there is coexistence among many faiths that is marred only by fundamentalist Muslims.    In Israel a Jew is free to convert to Islam if he likes, officially and documentally speaking, at the highest level. A Muslim man is free to marry a Jewish woman in a secular court, and the marriage would be recognized. There are Islamic courts for settling family matters among Muslims and a Muslim ministry that is the equivalent of Al Awqaf. Non-Muslims are forbidden to pray on the Temple Mount out of the beliefs of this ministry. I challenge anyone to find any Muslim or Shariah state with a record of freedom of religion as clean as Israel's.    Bravo Sierra is a Lebanese Muslim. Lebanon was a large Christian majority country as recently as the 1960s, with a very rightwing government. The Lebanese Civil War that raged for 15 years and terrorized God knows how many Christians, and then Hezbollah and the Palestinian Muslim militias - and the wave of assassinations of politicians from the Christian right - you have 14 million Lebanese living abroad, the majority of whom are Christians, and they were of course blocked from participating in the elections after the Cedar Revolution by Syria - all in all, the Lebanese Christians have a far greater emigration rate than the Muslims, and the Lebanese Shiites have the highest birthrate in the country. In short, Lebanon, by way of terror and war and violence and assassination and intimidation and demographics, is now only 35% Christian, when it was 70% Christian 60 years ago. Perhaps Bravo Sierra is proud of this and expects the same to happen in Israel.

xSHRJw46aa	Once you see the "Grand" Canyon, it becomes your new definition for big.  I have never seen a picture that does it justice.  The colors, the size.  It is just gorgeous.  Check out the giant California Condors if you go.  They are the big birds with number on their wings.  Some of the rangers have books that tell the history of each condor based on the number.  Also, make sure you participate in one of the ranger led talks when you are there.  We went to the Condor talk.  It took place just off the trail along the rim of the canyon.  The rangers know a great deal about everything around them, and they love to share.  If you are traveling with kids, make sure you get Junior Ranger booklets for them.  You will enjoy the exercises as much as they do.|`|AA11620976	Yes Many times > I've lived an hour away from it and I have my size 14 bootprints all over the inside of it   It is one of those rare and  special places that  neither photographs nor descriptions can possibly ever do justice  too  From a hiker's perspective it's really paradoxical because you expect to be  walking in an awesome space But then you walk into a side canyon  or a wash and this big  canyon becomes a very special and very intimate place to be   The deafening silence of the Canyon  when there are no aircraft over head is palpable   Then there is all of that amazing geology   Again from a hiker's perspective you absolutley have to learn the geology of the Canyon and the reason is that since the Canyon is this open book geology test with all of this exposed rock  ,all hiking guide books for the Canyon use the various geological formations as reference points when giving directions>Hikers do the same thing when giving directions to other hikers  The best book on GCN geology is  Corridors of Time by Ron Redfern  http://www.amazon.com/Corridors-time-pan...

zrR7KXCnaa	Too much.. (As I also a Slovene)  Capital: Ljubljana, interesting for sightseeing, nut you need just a day to see everything. Well you can have a really in-depth sightseeing and see the whole city. In addition to centre of Ljubljana I would also recommend you to see Tivoli park and if you like local specialities you should go and eat a Hot-Horse and no it's not like hot dog it's really made of horses meat. I would also recommend the mostec park and Ro?nik hill that are above Tivoli park you'll have pure nature in centre of Lj.  Other things I would recommend:  I personally would go to Velenje where you can see a coal-mining museum which is very interesting and also Velenje is known to have the biggest statue of Tito in the world, but it's hard to find it...  I would recommend Kras region where even I could spend years and not feel bored (I hope that some day I'll live there). You have to see ?tanjel, Postojnska cave, Predjama castle. Maybe cerknica lake which is a interesting as it is a largest intermittent lake in Slovenia but not the only one.  Then there is coast small, but interesting.  The Alpine part is very nice to...    Let that be enough|`|3fHZOobiaa	I know that it is a country in Northern-Balkans, that it shares its boundary with Italy, that it is a very nice tourist place and that Ljubljana is the capital city, moreover it is a member of EU and euro is its currency...

These are the places I visited when I went there.....|`|AdQXw4olaa	Well, I know quite a lot because I live here!

Colombia is a BEAUTIFUL country and a whole lot safer and more fascinating than I ever expected it to be.    LOVE the sophisticated feel of Bogota with all the great cafes and clubs in Zona Rosa/Candelaria and all the excellent museums and arts venues.    LOVE the mellow vibes of Medellin, its friendly people, and its clean, modern feel. Great nightlife in the Parque Lleras area, as well as Calle 70 and other fun areas.

Also in Bogota, check out the bulletproof tailor's shop. It was one of the highlights of my trip.|`|Mkb0wTjAaa	Im from Venezuela and there is nothing diferent to see, the same lifestyle, the same clear water beaches, the same beautiful girls, the same social issues, the same languaje, the same...

I recommend the Eje Cafetero or Coffee-growing-region which is a beautiful region where they grow coffee and bananas. It is a lot of fun and I recomend that place the most, It is in the departamentos of Quindio, Risaralada, Valle Del Cauca, and Caldas. I recommend El parque nacional del cafe (www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com), and Bosque Del Saman canopy (www.fincahotelelbosque.com). A trip on a boat made of guadua (like bamboo) down a river. Its a nice place with good scenery too,

I used to ask Koreans, aren't you worried about North Korea. Most just say, this has been going on for so long and aren't worried and are always more worried about the economy.    Saber-Rattling Tactics      North Korea Should Refrain From Provocative Acts    North Korea's threat to take an ``all-out confrontational posture'' against the South is seen as a carefully calculated move to escalate tension ahead of Barack Obama's inauguration as 44th U.S. president. It seems that the reclusive communist country is trying to draw attention from the new American government that is expected to prioritize troubled spots such as Iraq and Afghanistan over the North Korean nuclear issue.    It is quite unusual that a spokesman for the chief of the General Staff of the (North) Korean People's Army issued a televised statement threatening to wipe out the South. Wearing a military uniform, he read the strongly worded message on the North's official Korean Central Broadcasting Station. The spokesman did not hesitate to use slanderous remarks to bring about confrontation to the inter-Korean ties.    ``Now that traitor (South Korean President) Lee Myung-bak and his group opted for confrontation,'' the North Korean military official said Saturday, ``our revolutionary armed forces are compelled to take an all-out confrontational posture to shatter them.'' Such a message is the first of its kind from the North Korean army's General Staff in 10 years. The acerbic statement came just hours after the North's Foreign Ministry said Pyongyang may not give up its nuclear weapons even if its ties with Washington were normalized.     The ministry's spokesman said the North will maintain nuclear weapons it has developed until it becomes free from the U.S. nuclear threat. ``Normalization of diplomatic relations and the nuclear issue are entirely different issues,'' the spokesman said. ``We can live without normalized relations with the United States but can't live without the nuclear deterrence. That is the reality of Korea today.''     Judging from the two separate statements, the North is apparently attempting to make use of the saber-rattling tactics to pressure the South to change its hard-line policy toward the world's last Stalinist country. At the same time the North is struggling to win an upper hand in to-be-resumed talks with the U.S. over the nuclear issue.     What's really worrisome is that the North might use military force to nullify the maritime borderline on the West Sea that was drawn by the U.S.-led United Nations Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The North has repeatedly claimed that the borderline should be redrawn further south, leading to naval clashes between the two Koreas in 1999 and 2002.    In this situation, the South should not overreact to the North's brinkmanship tactics. What's important is to avoid any unnecessary conflicts with the North and further deterioration in the inter-Korean relations that have frayed since President Lee took office last February. The Lee administration has opted for a low-key approach toward the North although it is stepping up its combat readiness to cope with any potential emergencies.    It is also necessary for Seoul and Washington to make joint efforts to better deal with the recalcitrant North. No one is certain about what the unpredictable communist regime will do to divert attention from its internal problems such as the reported ill health of its leader Kim Jong-il. Therefore, South Korea and the U.S. should strengthen collaboration in forcing the North to completely dismantle its nuclear program and become a responsible member of the international community. First of all, Pyongyang ought to give up its saber rattling and brinkmanship to move toward reconciliation, peace and co-prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.      http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opi...
1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	There was never a palestinian nation, Palestinian Arab nationalism is largely a post-World War I phenomenon that did not become a significant political movement until after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's capture of the West Bank.The term "Palestine" is believed to be derived from the Philistines, an Aegean people who, in the 12th Century B.C.E., settled along the Mediterranean coastal plain of what are now Israel and the Gaza Strip. In the second century C.E., after crushing the last Jewish revolt, the Romans first applied the name Palaestina to Judea (the southern portion of what is now called the West Bank) in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel. The Arabic word "Filastin" is derived from this Latin name  Jerusalem was never a capital city of any Arab country, and Jerusalem was never the capital of any Arab entity. In fact, it was a backwater for most of Arab history. Jerusalem never served as a provincial capital under Muslim rule nor was it ever a Muslim cultural center. For Jews, the entire city is sacred, but Muslims revere a site  the Dome of the Rock  not the city. "To a Muslim," observed British writer Christopher Sykes, "there is a profound difference between Jerusalem and Mecca or Medina. The latter are holy places containing holy sites." Besides the Dome of the Rock, he noted, Jerusalem has no major Islamic significance.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	there never was and hopefully and   God willing there never will be|`|01NUrwfYaa	there has never been a palestinian nation for arabs that is,    - the ottoman empire ruled it until WWI  - british mandate by league of nations ruled palestine, transjordan (jordan), and what is now israel.  - in 1948 british mandate expired and israel was supposed to receive half of palestine and the west jerusalem (no holy sites).  - there was a war that same year, and arab forces were defeated, a few moe in the 60s, including 1967... also 1973  - israel pummeled egypt and syria and disabled there entire airforces within hours.. crossed the sinai and occupied about 3 or 4 times more land then israel proper.. think it was yom kippur war..    - after that man nations were defeated.. israel controlled the west bank and gaza.    - egypt never allowed palestinians in gaza citizenship  - transjordan annexed the west bank, didn't care about the palestinians.  - I'm thinking 1973 was the major war and israel captured all the terr.. sorry don't remember exactly.  - so palestinians want east jerusalem as there capital. but arab nations don't want peace they want israel gone.  - doesn't matter what they say, they want israel gone.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The term Palestine is rarely used in the Old Testament, and when it is, it refers specifically to the southwestern coastal area of Israel occupied by the Philistines.

Before Israel occupied the land, it would be generally accurate to say that the southwestern coastal area was called Philistia (the Way of the Philistines, or Palestine), while the central highlands were called Canaan. Both the Canaanites and the Philistines had disappeared as distinct peoples at least by the time of the Babylonian Captivity of Judea (586 B.C.), and they no longer exist.

Or the Apaches or the Chickasaw Nations don't exist because the cartographers never put Apachia or Chickasawstan on some map? It's just dumb. The Palestinian people, Arabs and Christians, have lived on ancestral lands for thousands of years and MANY Palestinian families hold deeds (also a relatively modern invention) to those lands.

If you try and find any reference to the Palestinians as we know them today, you will find they did not exist until 1967. Before that, they largely identified as Jordanians.

The Canaanites disappeared from the face of the earth three millennia ago, and no one knows if any of their descendants survived or, if they did, who they would be.    Sherif Hussein, the guardian of the Islamic Holy Places in Arabia, said the Palestinians' ancestors had only been in the area for 1,000 years.9 Even the Palestinians themselves have acknowledged their association with the region came long after the Jews. In testimony before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946, for example, they claimed a connection to Palestine of more than 1,000 years, dating back no further than the conquest of Muhammad's followers in the 7th century.10 And that claim is also dubious. Over the last 2,000 years, there have been massive invasions that killed off most of the local people (e.g., the Crusades), migrations, the plague, and other manmade or natural disasters. The entire local population was replaced many times over. During the British mandate alone, more than 100,000 Arabs emigrated from neighboring countries and are today considered Palestinians.    By contrast, no serious historian questions the more than 3,000-year-old Jewish connection to the Land of Israel, or the modern Jewish people's relation to the ancient Hebrews.    ...[the Palestinian Arabs'] basic sense of corporate historic identity was, at different levels, Muslim or Arab or - for some - Syrian; it is significant that even by the end of the Mandate in 1948, after thirty years of separate Palestinian political existence, there were virtually no books in Arabic on the history of Palestine..|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	There is a slight discrepancy between what Muslims say, and what is the truth.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	Palestinian is the name given to the indigenious people of the region that the Romans called "Palestine"....

There were riots by Palestinian Arabs against Palestinian Jews prior to Israel's formation. Arabs and Jews may have lived side by side, but there was always tension. Plus Jews weren't treated well by the Muslim rulers (or the Christians for that matter).    Plus it's a bit different because as along as Palestine was under Islamic control, it was OK for the Jews to live as Dhimmis under Islamic rule. But it's not OK for Jews to actually rule their ancient homeland under mainstream Islamic theology. Any land that was part of the Islamic empire and was lost needs to be recaptured according to mainstream Islamic theology.    Plus you should look up the documents that the Arab nations issued as justification for invading the newly formed state of Israel. The justification is religious in nature.|`|vmv1rP76aa	The difference is Christian extremists are in denial that they are doing anything wrong.

BTW, the Arab extremist movement to expel or kill all Jews from the Holy Land did not begin in 1948.  There was an active movement, exemplified by Hitler's ally Mohammad Amin al Husayni.  As soon as the Ottoman Empire broke up and the British created the British Mandate of Palestine, he and his followers agitated to get rid of the Jews.  Britain's appointed task was to get the Mandate of Palestine ready for self government.  It did help organize the states of Jordan and Israel out of Mandate land.  Israel was necessary because so many of Husayni's fellow travelers were unwilling to live with Jews; the Jews had to have their own state.|`|5oSnj1eTaa	My dear Lulu, I am afraid I will have to agree with you.  We the Christians have done in the past some terrible things in the name of God.  You see I have repeatedly posted here that the next Jewish holocaust will be executed by some of us the Christian people.  You see deep down all the Mohammedan followers are God fearing people that very rarely go to extreme.  If they do it seems there was no other option in sight.  Take the example of Palestine, do you think that there would be "Israel" right now if the Jews had committed these terrible war crimes against some Christians?  I doubt it very much.  Greetings|`|t58rc9tCaa	Lulu:    First, while you're right in that fundamentalist Islam and fundamentalist Christianity do not differ in terms of expansionist and fascist ideology, the vast difference between them is their popularity. Christian fundamentalism is virtually nonexistent - yes, there is a far-right Christian lobby in the US, but the US is an extremely free and nonreligious country where only a tiny minority of the 80% or so of Americans self-identifying as Christians, would agree with hardcore Christian beliefs. The majority would probably not even agree that non-Christians need Jesus as their only salvation. Yes, George Bush did make several ill-advised references to his faith, but he can hardly hold a candle to any Muslim preacher, and I've had the chance to observe many in the squalid mosques of the Middle East where anything goes because there is no concept of political correctness. George Bush DID use political correctness, believe it or not. When he used the term "Islamofascism," for example, he made it clear that he believed that Islamofascism was very different from the teachings of mainstream Islam and from the large majority of Muslims. Of course, this explanatory part of his speech was ignored and Muslim lobbyists took "Islamofascism" out of context.    Let's stick to simple facts: There is not one Christian country in the world that implements the laws of the Old or the New Testament. All Christian countries in the world are secular and guarantee freedom of religion, and respect it as well. The most Christian you can politically get these days is to ban euthanasia or abortion. Countries that have Christianity as their official religion, like those of Scandinavia, do this for purely ceremonial purposes. In fact, Scandinavia has one of the highest rates of atheism in the world.    Meanwhile, the vast majority of the world's 58 Muslim states implement some degree of Shariah. Those that implement Shariah completely have among the most tarnished human rights records in the world (Somalia, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, etc). Even those that are supposedly secular, have many human rights clashes with ceremonial Islam, like Egypt.    Almost all Muslim countries implement formal and informal regulations that would be considered religious apartheid in Western eyes, and this goes completely uncriticized by the UN and the international community. The very law of forbidding Christian men from marrying Muslim women is an example, or the arrest and penalization of Christian missionaries who preach to Muslims.    You will find very few Christians or Israeli Jews who espouse the views you have mentioned in your post. However, you will find a great many Muslims even in Europe who:    - believe Muslims who leave Islam should be killed (36% of young British Muslims).  - believe Theo Van Gogh and Pim Fortuyn deserved to die ("If you insult Islam, you have to pay" was a "typical" response according to an article I read).  - support the Salman Rushdie fatwa (even Cat Stevens/Youssef Islam hinted at this, and his records were boycotted in America).  - reject integration (in polls!) and believe they should have the right to develop along separate lines (44% of UK Muslims).  - sympathize with suicide bombers, regarding them as martyrs or believing that their cause is pure while their methods are wrong (13% polled regarded them as martyrs; 12% sympathized with their cause).  - are responsible for anti-Semitic violence (Muslims are 4-5% of the EU population and are responsible for 50% of all attacks on Jews).  - would like the Shariah to be implemented in their host country (40% of UK Muslims).    Recently there was outrage in the UK over the Government's likening Muslims with Shariah views to the BNP. But what's the real difference?    You know that this is true.    In short, the problem of Christian fundamentalism relative to Islamic, is commonly very much overstated.    Second, about the two-state solution: most Palestinians have absolutely no intention whatsoever of capitulating to the existence of Israel. The proposal of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is only seen as a milestone.     Yassir Arafat himself said that since the Palestinians could not defeat the Israelis in war, they would have to consolidate their hold on any part of the land they could obtain through peace, and then use their superior numbers to overwhelm Israel demographically if not militarily.    This is part of why the Palestinians are having so many children (>3% population growth rate). It's not just culture or poverty. The Palestinians believe that their nuclear weapon is the womb. I was watching Al Aqsa TV and I saw a preacher boast that Allah had blessed the Palestinians with many "banoon" and the Israelis with few. Once again, Yassir Arafat himself believed in the tactical advantage of population explosion - he believed that Israel could not overpower a future 6-7 million Palestinians living in the territories.    It is ironic that even Arafat, who won the Nobel Peace prize, only used the Oslo Accords to legitimatize his interests. He had no intention of living with Israel in the long term.    This is the same reason why Hamas offered Israel a year long truce - but not a permanent ceasefire. Hamas even said that a permanent ceasefire would undermine its vow to fight the occupation indefinitely. In Islam, it is permissible to propose a ceasefire to your enemy so that you can build up your strength and reprepare for war. There are fatwas on this. This is the only reason Hamas would ever agree to a ceasefire, and never to peace.    I access Arab media all the time, and even in the media of states that supposedly recognize Israel, Israel is always presented as Palestine.

I have to say that I've read everything you and Teresa both posted here and as an Arab-American Christian whose parents fled the Middle East to avoid the situation there I have to agree with Teresa.  I also know a great many other Arab-Americans and Christians who also support Israel.    If the Palestinians, or more precisely Hamas only wanted their own country it might be one thing. But they obviously have no intentions of building a country and their primary goals appears to be destroying Israel.     No one likes war, or the fact that innocent people die in wars.  But it is the inevitable result when one nation or people set out to destroy another like Hams is trying to do to Israel. Hezbollah did the same in Lebanon and other factions of radical Islam have done it in other parts of the wrold.      So, whether you like it or not, the Israeli government has every right to defend its people using whatever means is necessary. That too is a fact of life, whether you agree with it or not.|`|AA11565799	Christian terrorists?  What are you talking about?

Had they mistreated, tortured and murdered captured Americans?  Do you have any Christian terror complaints from say the last 100 years that you want to lay on us?    Addition:  I flat out reject your entire premise.  If President Bush violated articles of the Geneva Convention, and I am not saying he did, then he did so as a secular leader of a secular country.

And there's your difference.|`|yNbGq4viaa	Wow, this is one of the most prejudiced, lop-sided views of religion I have ever had the misfortune to read.  I am a member of a Christian church that is extremely strict.  Not only are we NOT intolerant of other religions, but we do not condone violence. True, we do believe that Christianity is the path to salvation, but we do not kill, beat, slaughter, shoot, terrorize, demean or otherwise harass anyone from other faiths.  Mainly because it goes against everything the Bible teaches about tolerance and love of your fellow man.  I have a hard time calling anyone that is a hater of a certain race or people a true Christian and in fact believe that they have deluded themselves into thinking hating a certain religion is justified.    Some people look at the Crusades and say, "Oh, well, Christians resorted to violence in order to push their beliefs on everyone else."  That's like saying that all whites are prejudiced because some of the whites owned slaves 150 years ago.      When you bring up the actions of General John Pershing and his treatment of Muslims, you have to think of Adolph Hitler and his treatment of the Jews.  Just because he was in power at the time doesn't mean that ALL Germans were Jew haters or that they ALL condoned his actions.  Also, you can't hold the current generation of Germans responsible for the actions of their ancestors.    When, in the past 200 years has there been a massive uprising of Christians moved to violence in order to propogate their religion?  I dare you to name ONE.  Meanwhile, I can name incidents instigated by the Muslim community one after the other.  The sad part is, most of the "Muslims" committing these acts are not true to the Muslim religion either.  They have twisted and warped the Muslim views in order to make them fit their personal vendettas.  So, be careful before you lump all Muslims or all Christians together and before you call anyone a terrorist.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	If you got extremists from all the different religions together and locked them in a room, they would find they have one thing in common - they hate that anyone disagrees with their convictions in any way.

AA12068233	You could try Atlanta Station like one poster said.    I used to live in the Post Collier Hills. It's not too expensive, nice, safe and it does have a pool. When I lived there rent was $735 for a 1/1.    It's a very good location because there is a Publix (a grocery store incase you didn't know) literally right across the street and several bars within walking distance. There's Willy's which is a Mexican restaurant and they have live music every Friday from Spring until it gets to cold. There's a ratty, but cool bar across the street that a lot of Georgia Tech kids go to called Mr. C's. About a half mile down the road the opposite way there's a cool little place called Fox and Hounds. In the shopping center just to the South of where Publix is there is a sports bars. I forgot what it's called, though.    It's located right next to 75N, less than a half mile, maybe 5 - 10 minutes in heavy morning traffic, so you have a straight shot down to I-20.    One word of caution, and this will apply to most any apartment, not just Post Collier Hills, the pet deposit for an animal that size will be about $750 or more, and a fraction of that will be refundable.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	Maybe look at the Vinings area or Sandy Springs.

It is a popular place for golf and dinghy sailing and is easily accessible from the city centre using the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) suburban rail system.|`|afeoTehEaa	It's a city right enough and it's Ireland's 33rd county.  We know a lot of people who come from County Sutton.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	There is a Sutton in County Dublin, on the way to Howth. A friend of mine lived there.|`|QY5YOZcmaa	Its a suburb in Dublin (north side) right beside howth|`|tTizVNWUaa	Sutton is in the London area of England.    There is a school in dublin called Sutton Park School|`|Jj30buLMaa	its a suburb of North Dublin.
vGeIgXOoaa	well i loved it in dublin it was soo snowy i had snowball fights nd did snow angels l.o.v.e.d it i wish it snowed again|`|S9JY6N0iaa	Loved the snow and walking in it and snowball fights etc.  But a bollocks to drive in traffic was mental :(|`|SP9szs13aa	its basically all melted in drogheda....but i have 2weeks off school :P  work experiance and then mid term...woooooo
vvlaZXO1aa	Surat Thai to Phuket is about 3 hours.  In my opinion you are better off just taking a bus form Bangkok to Phuket directly, it would be faster and probably cheaper.      A boat from Phuket to Phi Phi takes roughly 1 hour.|`|Vlp50eEGaa	I have driven it before but can't remember the distance, it's about a 3 hour drive.  I still can't understand why people will take a train and bus to Phuket when you can get a bus trip which I believe will cost you less then both a train and bus.  The bus from Bangkok to Phuket is about 12 hours.  The train and bus a little longer.  They only have 1 track in many areas and if another train is passing you can be stopped and waiting.  Bus is more reliable to me.
pMrdTbCXaa	The Canon 450D also goes by the name Canon EOS Kiss X2 in Japan.  It is difficult to find it under the 450D badge.    The price at Bic Camera (major electronics retailer) is 65,300 Yen for just the body.  72,500 Yen for a single lens kit.    The third link shows you the price at discount retailers.  Generally online shops only.  The lowest list price is 51,120.
aSxl6l0Gaa	LOL. I've taken the subway that late. Just be mindful of where you sit. If I'm traveling late at night, I usually sit in the conductor car (usually the middle of the train/platform), and sit across from the conductor's door. And as weird as it sounds, pay attention as you get to stops and when the door opens and closes. (I know you'll only be on for a little bit, but I remember a time when some freak was punching people in the head just before the door closes.)    And as for NJT, are you taking the last train out? (I think the last train to Trenton is at 1:20 or something.) I'd be a little more wary about, to be honest. Because the train is so long, it's often harder to try to track down a conductor, I worry sometimes, especially if the train is not crowded. People can hide behind seats, and since you are going on a weekend, you're going to be on a train with a whole bunch of drunk people. I've done that ride a couple of times, and it's not fun at all. I've seem some fights; I've seen some arguments; and I've seen a lot of puking. Just be really aware of your surroundings, and try to sit in a crowded car--the more people around you, the better.    Have fun, though!|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Its fine these days.    Just use good judgement.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	no problem at all. there might even be cops on patrol. chances are you'll spend more time on the platform than riding the train. the same should be for NJT. in fact, i'd feel safer on the train than off of it.    btw, i know what you mean about the Broad Street Line...|`|OZJuOio7aa	I have ridden that line that late at night and never had a problem - especially between those two stations, as they are in high-traffic areas. As the other answerer said, just use good judgement. I can't speak to NJtransit, though.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	It's fine -- just stay alert, don't try to ride around drunk, and don't engage with strangers.  BTW, the line you're talking about is the "A/C/E," not the "A M C".  The C does not run after midnight, but the A and E do.
KaP78IoBaa	Hi, the fastest way I can imagine is taking the National Rail from Heathrow into Bournemouth station, which is an aproximately 3 hours trip and then the Airport Shuttle from the station to the airport. That is a suttle bus service that runs hourly between the station and the airport. The times for the trains are available a http://nationalrail.co.uk/ just ype "Heathrow" at departure station and "Bournemouth" as arrival statio. There are lots of options to chose and fares I have seen are around 40 GBP. You can find info on the airport suttle service here: http://www.bournemouth-airport-shuttle.c... and here: http://www.bournemouthairport.com/bohweb...  The travel time from the station to the airport is around 15 minutes.  You can also see other train options with Virgin Trains at https://www.buytickets.virgintrains.co.u...    Hope this helps|`|UzPFTdUFaa	Catch the Air to Rail express bus from Heathrow to Woking Station and then a South West Trains train; there are two trains per hour from Woking to Bournemouth
dSQxCGbJaa	If you think you'll be able to sleep on the flight without the sleeping tabs, I would recommend not using them. They make me proper drowsy and foggy long after the flight. (But that's just my experience)    It is helpful to stay awake throughout the day when you get off the flight,as your body needs to settle into a new routine. I would say, it's not as bad as you think it's going to be. Just try and stick to a pattern of sleep and you'll be fine.    Rest well before you get on the flight and drink loads of water. A glass of red wine in the airport always helps me to relax and sleep on the flight, but that's not usually what's recommended as alcohol seriously dehydrates you...but personally, it just chills me out enough to snooze!    Good luck and have a great trip!|`|3LPTLUczaa	Sleep on the plane.|`|1f53d307e103593725c9ad616aeeaca1aa	If you'll be there for 6 weeks, it is not vital to beat jet-lag right away. People who travel for business and need to work effectively upon arrival for only one week then fly home have more to worry about. It is more important to get enough rest so that you don't come down with the flu that you may pick up on the flight. During the day, it really helps to stay outdoors and get some sun.|`|Tcwru3eDaa	i would try to sleep without a tablet because they do make you drowsy  i usually try to sleep on long flights by reclining my seat a little and wearing a thing that goes over Ur eyes      happy flying!|`|4NNlQAuhaa	Hi try looking on this webpage you might find some advice    http://www.thetravelinsider.info/2002/05...

There is a bus system (Lynx), but I don't really recommend it.

Enjoy your trip|`|AA11707357	It might be too cold for the beach.  The closest beach is on the Atlantic side and that is cold all year long.  The closest is probably Satelite beach or Coco Beach.  I would check out launch schedules from Nasa.  Watching a rocket launch will change your life.  There is Downtown Disney and Citywalk.  I recommend both butif you are on a budget Citywalk is cheaper.  Check out Kareoke Star.  It's a kareoke bar with a live band and back up singers.  Hope you have a good time.
6fanRjFaaa	next week, over 2/14.  the city will be taken over by NBA all-star weekend.  most of the basketball events will take place downtown, but surely lots of parties in old town to celebrate.  weather will be 80s, and i dont think youll need a light jacket.

Me personally, I think it's the best place in the world, but other people think it's the worst. So all I can say, is u gotta come and experience it by yourself.|`|hhhk499qaa	its very fun there. you can do what ever you want there  good luck  BTW, ive been in sharm el sheikh, its very nice there

PA0bGBtCaa	Unless you're flying to a private strip in uncontrolled airspace. I've been flying around for a few years, and I've been to some very questionable runways before, but all public runways that I've landed at have had the big touchdown zones on them. Not all of them were precision landing capable either.    I'm sure there are some public ones out there that only have a runway number and nothing else, but when flying VFR, the touchdown zone is a good spot to want to land your plane.
86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Most airlines permit a carry on bag no larger than 45 lineal inches (h+w+l) and a personal item such as a purse, laptop bag or small backpack. Most airlines require that your personal item be no larger than 36 lineal inches. Check your airlines website, not all airlines are the same and some airlines strictly enforce their policies.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	The realistic answer is yes.    I see these morons all the time with like 3 or 4 huge bags getting on the plane. Security does not even pay attention to how many bags you are bringing, and the airline doesnt either.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	I believe everyone is allowed to have two carry-on's because if they only allowed women to then that would be sexist. But different airlines allow more or less carry-on's than others so his best bet would be to go to their website or call them.|`|Tcwru3eDaa	he needs to book in another bag online|`|iC4hjwVsaa	TSA security regulates carry on to 1 bag and 1 smaller personal item like a purse or briefcase.  Many times travelers push the limit by taking 2 bags with 1 bag being smaller.  If you get through the security checkpoint then the airline may have an issue with the backpack if it is very large.  Check with the specific airline for size restrictions.    If the backpack complies with size then he can use that as his carry on and a smaller abg as his personal item.|`|c5njkH5Oaa	It depends which counties you are flying between.  Some airports will make you check one bag in.  This is true for British airports, and some European ones.  Ladies have to put their handbag inside their carry on, or check the carry on in. I have never had to check in a secind carry on at a US or Canadian airport though.  The weight of the carry on is also an issue...i forget what the limit is, but it isn't all that much, so it really depends how much he is taking.|`|mZtXd9Evaa	It depends on how big the backpack is.  I travel frequently and I have a carry-on but then I also use one of those drawstring gym sack. I believe most athletic apparel brands make them these days. I've never had a problem with those. I would think a large backpack probably wouldn't work, but I'm not positive.  Hope this helps!

m1V5ws73aa	The New England Aquarium is fun, but check with their website to see how late they are open-- certainly not all night!  I don't know of any place that would be open all night, but maybe you could take him to some all night store like Wal Mart and try to interest him in the toys, or get some children's books from the library that you can read together with him.  Games or anything that will require him to participate in may help him stay awake.  Best of luck!|`|AA6Aq94vaa	You might want to check out events listings in the papers.

AA12074269	The bet best would be to get on the stata committee or at least attend the meetings. There may have been a problem with hail damage or flooding or something of that type that has resulted in the extra fee. The standard levy works out to a little under 35K. Is there a garden that is being mowed? Outside painted? Stairs repaired or elevator to maintain? Is there airconditioning that is installed into each of the apartments? If so then the maintainance of these is what the levy goes towards.|`|hT7BhNamaa	cwis_e, that sounds awfully high, here co owners pay on Condo fees on the square footage of their apartment, and some don't even reach that high a rate.     In the buildings I manage, they have heated pool, fully equipped gymnasium, steam room and dry sauna, as well as showers. There is also a function room that can be hired with kitchen at an unbelievable cheap rate.    Do you have some government body you can refer to?
g05wGcPhaa	Since this is in the Miami section I'm assuming you want to move to this part of town.    Miami has a number of good and bad cities to live in and to avoid.     In Miami the cities are divided into numerous area's. Places to avoid in Miami are Liberty City, Overtown, North Miami, Opa Locka, Atlantic City, Carol City, Little Haiti, or anything around Opa Locka Airport. Good places to live in are some parts of Homestead, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne, Coral Gables, South Miami, and Midtown. If want to live in a SAFE good neighborhood then expect to pay very high rent/mortgage.    Affordable homes? Psshh..Miami is a big city and it's divided into smaller cities so it depends which area of Miami you move to. Some area's are prone to crime and poverty so the average apartment rent for a good area there would be about $1500 if you live in a decent area. Home's are selling less and less today so expect to see real estate prices in the 350k-400k.    As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.2%. So that means 752,000 are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.    Public Transportation? LOL. Not going to work. If you want to live in Miami expect to have a car because public transportation here lacks when it comes to time. The buses don't get you anywhere in less than 45 minutes so don't expect it unless your just going down the street. Taxi fares are over the roof if you add up all the expenses. All of the money your going to spend on public transportation can go towards a car.    Also If your planning on moving to Miami get ready for nasty rush hour traffic and constant accidents on the 826 (Palmetto Expressway) and any other highway in Miami-Dade County. Miami has the worst set of drivers that's why I rather live in Broward County.    This is the South Florida/Miami economy right now and ANYTHING can happen within 2 years and make this place like it used to be, but for now these are the current facts.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Beware of the little old headless drivers.

The colleges here require that unless you reside in the area and are a freshman you must live in the dorm your freshman year unless you go to a community college. The dorms do no allow pets. You will not be able to support yourselves with the kind of jobs you will get without a college education. Unemployment is high and there are lots of people competing for unskilled jobs. The big point is will your parents support you? If they will not, then wait until you finish college to move down here. Please also be aware that many apartments will either not rent to someone with a dog or will charge you a large pet deposit fee.
VVSqTdaOaa	I have seen people with fancy cameras before with the small bag. Epcot has great pictures spots. Epcot does not have roller coasters but it has Test track if your camera bag is small enough you can put them in between your feet or some rides like Mission space have compartments for small things.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Personally, I wouldn't trust someone else to watch my DSLR.   My friend who is a photojournalist often asks me to hold onto her DSLR when she is running around doing some other things because it's so heavy, and I keep it around my neck and won't set it down anywhere because it can be swiped in a second of inattention.  Can you take a cheaper camera with you for that?  Something that's maybe small enough to put into a waist bag and keep it with you even on the coaster.  You can still get decent pics out of a semi-point and shoot.  Best of luck, and have fun.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Do you really want to be hauling around a big camera bag with a camera and lenses all day?  Some rides have net bags to keep your bags in. But unless you are going with someone who is not riding, you can't just leave your bag with some stranger. Disney cast members will not watch your stuff. There are lockers at the entrance to all Disney parks. EPCOT does not have any roller coasters. You should be able to bring a bag on Test Track.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I agree that you might not want to drag all that equipment around the parks.  You might be able to have a Disney employee at the ride keep an eye on your stuff.  They're usually very cooperative, but it could be they can't take responsibility for something like that.  Honestly, if you rented a stroller and put your things in a diaper bag, I'll bet nobody would touch them.  You see those parked outside of every ride at Disney.
uzsIp1oeaa	John D, its your trip. And one paid for by you. I guess its your right to do any darn thing you want to do. And that includes watching footie in a coffee shop. And smoking up a storm.    Although I have never seen a CS have any sports on the TV.    What you want is a sports bar I think. There is one next to the main Bulldog on the Lidesplien Or Coco's Outback, a food place, on the Rembrandtplien. Now you may or may not be able to smoke in these places. The rules have changed. What was OK a year ago may not be OK today.    And please they still allow Brits in most places. A loud, drunk, roudy group may get shown the door.

If you take the effort to come to Amsterdam, explore the town, do touristy things and do things that are not available at home.

You could get lucky, but i estimate you have about a 5% chance.|`|AA11705909	You would want a coffee shop that caters for Brits, the Bulldog should do you. But why do you want to sit in a coffee shop for 6 days watching footie? You could do that just as easily at home with your pals, just get in a couple of crates of Heineken, an ounce of spliff and a plasma TV and you are well away. I just do not understand some Brits, why do they go abroad and do the same things they could do just as easily at home? Strange.|`|TadINnYoaa	http://www.coffeeshop.freeuk.com/Sheeba....    Good weed.

Just look at what the mayor is proposing and has blamed them due to drunkeness every weekend like they do in UK. Its all they know !  Amsterdam is sick of it.
tqD9xUpYaa	Are you thinking of the second chance program run by the US Attorney's office?  Mayor Jackson and his police chief have agreed to hire a felon as a traffic controller, who will start his job tomorrow.  I don't think the mayor, or the City of Cleveland, specifically have a felon job program.  I wish the man good luck in his new job and hope he does well.|`|IOcHUMPCaa	check out:    http://www.jobs2me.net

I was there last spring, and kicked myself for not going to the Ritz instead.    Mind you, I've never been to the Ritz for tea, but I hear it is out of this world with the swan pool and all (spring and summer only).    Like Chris said above, the St James does it, too, and it looks amazing.    So the Queen E:  It was nice, but really not a big deal, nothing made me say "WOW".|`|ztb1F35Xaa	they shud

Very dirty.|`|9fBm2mOJaa	I don't see why not. As long as you are not dumping water or waste, it should not be  a problem. Pick a quiet suburban  street rather than a city location and no-one should mind an overnight stay. Parking like that is free.    You are probably better off in a campground though - better security and amenities, more people. Some are better than others and the one in Takapuna looks pretty good as you can park right on the waterfront..|`|JhfE14iLaa	There is nowhere you can stay for free, and you can't just park at a car park for the night.

Here it is though, Anaheim bus to Long Beach. Long Beach to UCLA. Possibly via the airport) UCLA over the hill  to Ventura BLVD. Then grab that bus to West Hollywood. Four or five buses, 6 - 7 hours.    Google LA County RTD for route maps. Google Orange County too.
38b1ffa24888207bae6b7d6a14477456aa	You really should know the answer to this one hmmmm!    Praia da Rocha in the Algarve.  Its an excellent mix of beauty and convenience.  A very popular choice with Portuguese and International tourists.    http://family.webshots.com/album/6987562...    This is a very snazzy place to go to.  It has a beautiful marina with bars, a large variety of restaurants and cafes overlooking the Arade river and the sea!    The beach is spectacular and conveniently located and with lots going on for veryone!   You are near Portim?o which is also lively and attractive (specially by the Riverside!).    The night atmosphere is great with quiet as well as vibrant places.     http://www.freemaps.net/admin/sources/ed...    From Praia da Rocha you can do day coach trips/tours to scenic Monchique, historical Silves, popular Lagos and extreme Sagres.     Boat trips from the riverside of Portim?o are great fun. They can go up to Silves, towards Carvoeiro or towards Alvor/Lagos.     Youll probably also visit one of water parks (http://www.slidesplash.com/index.php?lan... ) and Zoomarine. http://www.zoomarine.com/ {No need for a car for these  you are picked up near one of the hotels at Praia da Rocha} and have lots of fun with lots of other activities including cultural ones part of Allgarve 2009.      I would be surprised if you were disappointed!  Take care of the strong sun in during the summer!

There are lots of nice bars and restaurants, and some lovely little traditional tavernas. A good selection of sandy beaches; Liminaki, Adams Nisi, Lantra, and Makronnisoss , and Napa has Eurpoes largest waterpark too.    You can take a boat trip from the harbour, passing by The Seacaves, Cavo .Greko, Konnos Bay, Protaras, Pernera, and, then, just after passing Kaparris, you will turn around just offshore from the ghost town of Famagusta, before making the return trip. the boat usually stops of a coiple of times to allow people to swim from the boat in the clear waters of the little coves near to konnos Bay. The boat is usually out from 11.30.am, returning around 4.pm. You coulds then call into one of the many restaurants in the harbour; Vassos Fish retaurant is worth a try.      You can get  a bus to Konnos Bay where there are plenty of watersports on offer, and as its a small cove, its less commercialised than some of the beaches.     If you choose to stay in a hotel, then take up some of the trips such as Lefkosia ( Nicosia). You can now pass through Ledras Street into the Turkish occupied north....but if you choose to do this, then remember to take your passport with you. Stroll around the old part of Lefkosia, and have a drink or a meal at one of the little tavernas.    Take a safari trip up the Troodos Mountains, or visit Paphos and see the mosaics in the harbour, or visit The Tombs of the Kings    There is loads to see and do here in Cyprus...and its safe and friendly too.|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	You could try Cambrils in Spain, it is just a short bus ride from Salou (which has all the pubs, clubs etc.) but Cambrils is quieter. It is also very close to Port Aventura Theme and Water Parks which are brilliant fun with excellent rides and it is also a short train journey to Barcelona where you will find all the culture you like. I stayed at the Cambrils Princess hotel and we loved the whole holiday.    EDIT This hotel is straight over the road from a huge beach and busses run in both directions from right in front of it too.

It has miles and miles of Golden Beaches with clear blue water where you can relax. it has many parks where yyou can go for picnics and walks. It also has Spain's largest Volcano Called Mount Teide. You can make a day trip out of that by going up in a Cable Car and looking at the national parks surrounding it. Furthermore Tenerife has its own seaworld, a massive aqaurium with all sorts of tropical fish and sharks...amazing!  You can take boat trips out to sea and stuff. there is also waterparks called 'Loro Parque', and '  Aqualand' and 'Parque Las guilas - Jungle Park'  and 'Camel Park' The night life can be fantastic as well, there are lots of night clubs. You dont get a lot of football hooligans or drunkards so it is pretty safe. i have been before and i would reccomend  hotle called 'VILLA TOGORA'. http://www.jetsetleisure.co.uk/aptvillat...    is is in a really pleasant location and very safe. it is clean and im sure you would love it.

You can get more info on smallworldvacations.com, then click "Disney World Resort". If you want the cheapest places to eat and everything, including park tips, go to mousesavers.com. :)  As for Disney Quest, I wouldn't recommend going there. It's packed full, even on school days, and you need to wait in a long line to get to games you could find in a normal arcade. There are some upper scale rides like Pirates of the Caribbean and I believe there's a raft ride, but I don't think it's worth the money it costs.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Disney doesn't do discounts.  There are lots of scams out there, so I suggest you buy either from Disney or an authorized discount dealer only.  Try AAA if you are a member, or http://www.mapleleaftickets.com or http://www.undercovertourist.com|`|0JAYAuVXaa	check round google|`|4GHJlTkkaa	I don't know how long you are planning on staying, or when your trip is, but Disney is currently offering a deal where if you buy 4 days of tickets/hotels you will receive three free.  I believe the deal extends through early June, but you have to book by March I think.  If that doesn't fit your needs you can also check with AAA if you are a member as they often offer discounts.  I'd also recommend the sites mousemiser.com and mousesaver.com.  Good luck!

nINIHF8baa	You have all totally missed the point of this question.    Its not who has a better system to deal with young pregnancies either inside or outside marriage.  Its not which group of girls get into sexual activities BY THEIR OWN CHOICE at a young age.    This is totally about the health risks incurred by very young teenage (and younger) pregnancies, which is not only condoned by the Islamic states but actively encouraged by their ruling theocracies.  Actually often the clerics are the worst ones at taking exceptionally young girls as a wife..    In many parts of the islamic world, marriage as young as possible is encouraged and condoned and it is quite common to find child wives and mothers at the age of 9 and 10.  In the West, this is not only vigorously discouraged, but steps would be taken to prevent this happening to the point of instituting serious legal codes to protect the child.    I once worked with a middle eastern woman who was a grandmother at 22.  She was virtually sold as a bride to a much older man by her father (mum had no say).  She had absolutely no say in her marriage and what happened to her during it.  She said she was forced into sex constantly and against her will but learned to just keep her mouth shut to avoid beatings.  She had her first child in marriage at the age of 10.  When her own daughter turned 11, she too was ''sold'' or traded to one of her husband's friends in exchange for the friends young daughter, (7 year old) who became this woman's husbands second wife.  The woman's daughter gave birth and as both the woman and her daughter said 'Thankfully it was a boy, so no more girls to go through the agony we've been through'.     The woman and her daughter were both so physically damaged by childbirth at such a young age that neither of them were capable of having further children.  The young 7 year old second wife suffered several years of rape by her husband before she finally matured enough to become pregnant and died due to complications during the pregnancy.    When I met this woman, she and her daughter had both been discarded by their husbands who had gone on to take several more very, very young brides.      Under Islamic law, the mother has no rights to her children and if she is divorced, her husband can and will take the children from her and with no provisions to see her children again.  She can also be tossed out of the family home with nothing more than the clothes she stands up in and enough money to feed herself for a couple of weeks (if she is lucky).  This is why there is a very high but very hidden prostitution rate in Islamic countries.  These women, often 12-14 year olds, have been married, had a child or two, been tossed out by the husband for a younger model, and left to their own devices.  Sometimes their families will take them back, but it is regarded as a huge disgrace and so the parents (read - father) won't have them back.  If they are 'lucky' they will be sold again to someone as a third or fourth wife but this time they will be hard used as house workers and child minders whilst the husband enjoys his younger first and second wives, or as farm labourers or money earners of some description.  In effect, not much better off than a slave.    They had both managed somehow to leave their countries (illegally) and had made their way to the west.    They have both had the physical and internal damage done to them repaired to where they can lead a normal life and both lead very quiet lives.  Both are working unskilled factory jobs in the same company and live together.  Neither of them will remarry or have kids and both of them have left islam.|`|DSVUvfGuaa	I think that you have misunderstood the situations, It is not the Government who is doing that... It is the people themselves who are practicing life like in the old days, and One thing els, why is the whole world focusing on the Arab culture that much. They want to practice their own religion their own way. So what the HECK is all that fuss about the Arab/Muslim nations. Some time I keep wondering, Is it any Buddys Business who comes to my home ? So please think of all those Arabs through Generations have been doing this with success and nothing happened WELL ?   I do not want to mention some other things in here , I am afraid to heart people that bad. But in brief, Why does the European children practice sex in a very early age and we are all quite about it?  I know what I am doing and aware of the whats going on in Europe. I live here ( Europe)|`|t58rc9tCaa	The average age of the commencement of sexual activity in the EU is 15 years and 8 months. The very lowest age of consent, is 14 years.    In Islam a girl is considered a woman as soon as she has her first period, and ready to have sex with her husband. Muhammad consummated his marriage with Aisha when, in solar terms, she was 8 years and 9 months old.    Teenage sex =/= child marriage    Mohamed B, if you don't like the way things are done in Europe where the kuffar have taken you into their homes and given you a house and a job and a standard of living that is greater than anything you could have dreamed off in the Shariah paradise you came from, feel free to leave.    And by the way, we all know that non-Muslim foreign workers in Saudi Arabia are allowed purely for economic reasons. They are isolated from the general population in their own compounds and they have no political representation whatsoever. Saudi Arabia has 5 million expatriates, and still quotes itself as 100% Muslim. Religious apartheid at its finest - even Israel calls itself only 76% Jewish.|`|4d381268b26155be917ffb27731db32eaa	In reality, there are heaps of non-Muslims who get pregnant at a young age. A few years ago, there was one at the age of 12. Many non-Muslims practice sexual intercourse in high school even in year 7 - where they are at the age of 11 or 12.    When a young Muslim gets married, she has the support of her family around her. An unmarried non-Muslim would not have such support if she got pregnant at a young age.
uvx3cnkJaa	Ali welcome to Saudi Arabia.     Coming to the point what the father did was very brave but it was actually the right thing to do. Islamically you need to know whether you re marrying a virgin or not its even written in the marriage contract. Im not sure if the girl had a boyfriend before she convirted to islam or not coz from what i understand this american family convirted to islam and then moved to ksa, if thats the case then becoming a muslim erases all sins in the past and hopefully Allah will forgive her for what she s done. In this case of you find it in your heart that you can overlook this matter spec if you find that the girl is a very good person who can be a good wife to you then make istikhara and go ahead with this marriage and know that you can go to heaven solely because of this generous act. Helping out a muslim sister is highly appteciated by Allah.     On the other hand, if you think you are a jealous person and you wont ever go over this issue then forget about the shole thing. You can also forget about it if the girl had a boyfriend and did what she did while she s a muslim..    Thats my advice to you anyway and btw if you re struggling to find yourself a wife in ksa i and my husband can help you out. We know the best of families from Saudi who marry their daughters to you in no time     Best of luck :)|`|AA11477027	I think there is no harm in marrying her. His father did nothin wrong.Best of luck|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Hah man. You still live in the dark ages, and you said you came from the USA ? What is it to be a virgin or not to be. A woman can loss it just riding a bike but you said that she had a boy friend... Hey that's too much in the Saudi. Never the less, I would go for it. you said that you are a Muslim SO Remember if you do go for it, and think of all the blessings that you shall gain in helping her and your self. If you love her then Look the other way and never use the case as a weapon in your future. Whats gone is gone  (give her and your self a chance to start a beautiful life) I am talking to you as a Father of 4 kids in Europe, and alhamdulilaah they are doing great.  When the good father approached you and told you the facts, it is because he does not want to be blamed later on and according to the Arab customs it is right and well done

3fHZOobiaa	1. Official Name of Country: Italian Republic     2. Popular Name of Country: Italy     3. Capital City: Rome    4. Administrative Divisions: Italy is subdivided into 20 regions (regioni, singular regione). Five of these regions have a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on some of their local matters; these are marked by an asterisk (*) in the table below. The country is further divided into 109 provinces (province) and 8,101 municipalities (comuni).      5. Other Major Cities : Ancona, Bari, Bologna, Catanina, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Trento, Turin, Venice.    6. Area : 294,020 SQ KM    7. Boundaries :  Italy shares its northern, Alpine boundary with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. The independent states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within the Italian Peninsula, and Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.    8. Landforms: Italy occupies an elongated boot-shaped peninsula, surrounded on the west by the Tyrrhenian Sea and on the east by the Adriatic Sea. It is bounded by France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia to the north. The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone; the Alps form its northern boundary. The largest of its northern lakes is Garda (143 sq mi; 370 km2); in the centre is Campotosto Lake. The Po, Italy's principal river, flows from the Alps on the western border and crosses the great Padan plain to the Adriatic Sea. Several islands form part of Italy; the largest are Sicily (9,926 sq mi; 25,708 km2) and Sardinia (9,301 sq mi; 24,090 km2). There are several active volcanoes in Italy: Etna, the largest active volcano in Europe; Vulcano; Stromboli; and Vesuvius, the only active volcano on the mainland of Europe.      9. Bodies of Water: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Catego...      10. Climate: The climate in Italy is highly diverse and can be far from the stereotypical Mediterranean climate depending on the location. Most of the inland northern areas of Italy, for example Turin, Milan and Bologna, have a continental climate often classified as humid subtropical (K?ppen climate classification Cfa). The coastal areas of Liguria and most of the peninsula south of Florence generally fit the Mediterranean stereotype (K?ppen climate classification Csa). The coastal areas of the peninsula can be very different from the interior higher altitudes and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer.    11. Natural Resources:  coal, mercury, zinc, potash, marble, barite, asbestos, pumice, fluorspar, feldspar, pyrite (sulfur), natural gas and crude oil reserves, fish, arable land    12. Land Use : arable land: 26.41%   permanent crops: 9.09%   other: 64.5% (2005)  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land, etc.    13. Environmental Issues/Natural Hazards: see here http://www.euro.who.int/countryinformati...    14. Population : In October 2007, the Italian population surpassed 59.8 million. Italy currently has the fourth-largest population in the European Union and the 23rd-largest population worldwide. Italy's population density, at 196.1 persons per kilometre, is the fifth highest in the European Union. The highest density is in northern Italy, as that one-third of the country contains almost half of the Italian population. After World War II, Italy saw an economic boom which lured the rural population to the cities, and at the same time it turned from a nation characterized by massive emigration to a net immigrant-receiving country. High fertility persisted until the 70s when it plunged below replacement, so that as of 2007, one in five Italians was a pensioner. Despite this, thanks mainly to the immigration of the 80s and 90s, in the 2000s Italy saw natural population growth for the first time in years.    15 Language : see, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_o...    16. Religion: Roman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. Fully 87.8% of Italians identified themselves as Roman Catholic, although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%).|`|AA10303328	My favorite reference place is the CIA World Fact Book, located at:  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...|`|alweKUW9aa	ancona is not a  one of the most important city at all along with bari, trento and catania  boundaries: france, switzerland, austria, croatia  landform: boot  the most important river is Po', tevere (rome) arno (florence)  language: italian  religion: most people are catholic  literacy 98 per cent or also more|`|bTtAQ8Pgaa	5.

This month the average temperature is a high of 73 and a low of 55.  Personally that means I'd carry some jeans and somethings to layer.  Some tshirts and some long sleeve shirts.

6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	it all sounds good. busch gardens vs universal vs disney-its just a matter of personal taste. busch has big roller coasters and lots of animals,universal has lots of thrill rides, disney has all sorts of fun stuff, but no big thrill rides. all are going to be crowded in june though    st augustine beach definitely warm enough to swim in june. i susally start swimming the first week of may. check out the beach at anastasia state park-its at the north end of st augustine beach. no cars, no buildings, just beautiful beach. also, check out anastasia watersports in the park, they rent kayaks, windsurferers etc. its beautiful to kayak along that stretch of water.  congratulations!|`|AA11707357	No real answer, but my honeymoon was in St. Augustine Beach.  Lots to do and super romantic.  Congratulations!|`|aH5CGP4Faa	That sounds like an excellent itinerary. Busch Gardens is pretty fun, but there's a lot more to do in central florida if you only want to spend a few days, between Disney and Universal.     St Augustine is the perfect town if you guys aren't really looking for nightlife, quaint shops, ghost tours, carriage rides, bed and breakfasts, similar to Savannah in many ways. The beaches in St Augustine in June are DEFINITELY warm enough! It'll be hot, hot, hot. Try some jet ski rentals in St Augustine, you can jet ski around in the bay by the Fort, see dolphins jumping all around and even park the ski at the docks of restaurants and bars up and down the Intracoastal.     Savannah is a nice place to end it, more bed and breakfasts, a lot of history to explore, and there's a lot of tourism created around that book!

g05wGcPhaa	Right now? Alot. As you know we are in a severe recession right now and the price for everything is rising.

Imqb5ueqaa	You can live comfortably, but nowhere like a king.    A 5 bedroom house in the enclave of the rich (Forbes Park, Dasmarinas Village) rents out for more than your full budget per month. Relative to this residential area, you will be classified very poor. So forget the notion of living like a king, because the rich who live in these areas do not even live like kings. Super-comfortably, yes.    Now, if you bring that budget to places outside of Metro manila, you could possibly rent a 5-bedroom house, spend for maintenance, household staff, and food. But there will be little left, if at all. And kings do not have to worry that they will have to wait for next month's pension to pay hospital bills.    Live in a modest but comfortable place. You will live a higher quality of life if you are confident you have enough funds for recreation as well as for emergencies.|`|rVUvopaLaa	for sure one of the reason why your dad wants to settle back(?) in the phils to help you out particularly with some domestic chores.  having such monthly budget it's quite sufficient enough for middle class 2 person dwelling.  but you need to know where particularly in the Phils you want the reason being the cost of living varies.     here are the considerations;  your dad being elderly you need to have good access to medical help. living in rural areas is not really a good option.  surely at 73 your dad needs to see a doctor regularly particularly a specialist like a cardiologist for example.      a good school for you if in case    security:  it can be risky if some people knows that you are from overseas & the almighty dollar can be a attraction from crooks.      living conditions:  you need to find apartments similar or suits your preference.  obviously things are different from where you're from.  meaning this can be costly.      healthcare: this is very expensive in the Phils like everytime you do anything you have to pay for it and there's no government subsidy whatsoever.  believe me there are hospitals that you need to buy your own cotton or bandages.  how's that?  medical procedures, practices can be unethical, unorthodox or simply weird.      in other words you need to save money in the event of something goes wrong with your dad medically speaking.  frankly speaking your monthly budget is not enough when he gets sick.  trust me.      now you want to k now if you can live like a king?  yes, but perhaps that's temporary because when he get's sick your money is insufficient.      that's also depending on how you live your life, how much you spend on things such as the utilities, food, clothing, entertainment, sports etc etc    finally you need to have a huge adjustment in your lifestyle and everything that you do, say etc etc.      personally, i would rather hire someone as carer from the Phils to help you out in overseas rather than moving to the Phils.  for me this is the perfect idea.    the way to do this sponsor someone for the carer visas or a carer visa tourist/working.  the paperworks and the expenses to process is a lot cheap than moving to the Phils.  the carer can be paid something like US$500 to $600 monthly which means you saves money and you don't need to move to the Phils.  you don't need to lose your friends and your dad will have a better medical attention than in the Phils.  you have better education as well.    good luck|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	I already answered your question a while ago.

Angeles City/Olonggapo City - exactly what you want, but there are already so many Americans living there.    Cavite/Laguna - there are good international schools in the area and anywhere south of Metro Manila isn't really city-living.    Cebu - talk about city-living in a rural area. life is simpler there.|`|AA11828341	As far as I know a foreigner can't own a house or a property here.   About Metro Manila rate for maid or helper, it can be another story for you guys because you're a foreigner, they might charge you higher, it could be up to $100/month. But then it's not bad at all,  With the money you will receive monthly of course you and your father can live in prosperity. It equals to 150 thousand pesos/month and it's really a big amount. You can rent a decent condo for 20,000 a month fully furnished in Makati. With food budget and all, say 20,000 a month is really more than enough. So save the money for your education too. You can study here and don't worry about quality because there's bunch of school in Manila that offers quality education.  If you would like to try a different place aside from Manila, you can try living here in Lucena City. Less cost for everything but food will be quite the same, oh well...bonus is fresh seafoods.    ----------------------  Camaro: Yes I think it's more that 150,000 pesos, thanks for correcting.|`|9vvEOHVXaa	Maids cost more.

B3FBgxjEaa	C.    There is no doubt that Portuguese have dramatically affected life in West Africa in both good and bad ways. West Africa advanced from primitive subsistence farming culture to a major worldwide exporter of goods. The Portuguese Christian influence can be seen in many places where sadistic spiritual worship changed dramatically to Christianity. However, the Portuguese also affected West Africa in bad ways. Malnutrition, poverty and slavery (c.an expansion of Africa's internal slave trade) came about because of the Portuguese presence and dominance.
AA11937736	400-500 Euros should be more than enough. You can get a nice lunch for 20 euros or less and few tourist attractions cost more than 10 euros to enter.     However, please note that there are ATM machines in France and Visa/Mastercard are accepted in most places. So there's no reason you have to carry all of it in cash.     Ask your bank in Canada which French Bank they are affiliated with and if you can use that banks ATMs. Bank of America, for example, is affiliated with BNP Paribus and BoA customers can use BNP ATMs.|`|f1j9TmlNaa	estimate for about 100 Euros a day if you want nice food then you may have to pay for it but if you just want sandwiches you can get then for about 10 euros a sandwich.

I'm assuming it is a major city since all the basics are covered for you. Honestly, just tell your bank that you are going to France and you can withdraw Euros as you go. That is how I have always done it in Europe. I know there may be a small fee for each transaction, but this is not too big of a deal as long as you are aware of how much you spend and then can take out how much you feel you need. Plus you aren't going around with a huge lump sum in your luggage. I would say bring like 200-400 Euros with you( obviously not all in your purse/wallet!) and then feel out how much you are spending. It is worth paying a couple of bucks to some bank in order to have the security of not running out of money.

(Special identity card for aliens of Greek descent) is issued to citizens of Albania or Russia of Greek descent.    You do not hold a Greek citizenship on that document and may not go to London without a tourist visa, since the United Kingdom does not belong to the Schengen area. The right to freely work in Great Britain is only granted to Greek citizens but not to aliens of Hellenic descent. Once your naturalization process is completed and you have gotten your Greece passport issued you may use all these rights but not beforehead.

And usually near port, they have a pilot on board, who is something with an excellent knowledge of the area, and then usually the pilot is in charge of the ship during that time.    So the answer is no.  No captain is going to let you drive the boat if you slip him a $20.|`|nYi7UJaxaa	Yes he will,they have the mini boats ready for you.|`|AA11850523	no way for security reasons|`|KIVJ9O4Faa	no, but he will get you close to the controls of the coast guard boat that will bring you to jail.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	Ha, ha, ha! Some cruise companies allow bridge visits, and you should take the chance to see what a cruise ship's bridge is like. Honestly, it's more like a computer control room nowadays! "Driving" the ship (boat??!) just means pressing a button or two and electronics do it all. The Captain might let you press a button, under close supervision - but is that worth $20?!
9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	Not terribly much as far as I can see.  There is an attraction in the centre of Nottingham - called the Tales of Robin Hood which has recently closed down.  I believe that the council declined to assist with funding.  There is a statue outside the Nottingham Castle and they hold a Robin Hood type event at the Castle occasionally.    There is also a visitor attraction in Sherwood Forest with marked paths to the Major Oak which was reputed to be where Robin and his Merry Men hung out.  They applied for lottery funding to expand but were not successful.  (but that attraction would not be under the management of Nottingham City Council as far as I am aware)

BBxB9Nkzaa	If you want to see a good sample of Japan in addition to Fuji-San, buy a Japan Rail Pass (JR Pass).  It will take less than 3 hours to go from Tokyo to Kyoto on the shinkansen (bullet train).  Kyoto has plenty of temples.  Nara does too and it is close to Osaka and Kyoto and easily accessible by local train.  Kobe is nice too.  Take the cable car up the mountain by Shin-Kobe station.  Hiroshima is about 80 minutes from there on the shinkansen.  From there try Miyajima just south of the city.  If you have time go to Nagasaki and Kagoshima to see Sakurajima.  It will be hard to see all of this in a week but feel free to pick and choose!  Also try Himeji castle.  It's  between Kobe and Hiroshima.    For the JR Pass go to www.japanrailpass.net|`|LLhLEIUAaa	If you are going to Tokyo for the first time, I think you should stick to Tokyo and nearby area to really enjoy your first visit. Trying to do too much on the first visit won't be much fun in my opinion.    When I had my father-in-law and his wife in Japan for the first time, they wanted to go to Kyoto, Nagoya, Mt. Fuji and of course popular spots in Tokyo and they were only gonna stay for 4-5 days. I suggested they would go Kyoto and Nagoya the next time and they fully enjoyed Tokyo area.     Anyway, the railroad pass the above poster said is good.

Peace    FX|`|AA10985791	NO NO NO, on a personal level I don't want to loose money on exchange rates again, the reason we are heading north is because Euro is stronger than a weakening, and previously over valued .      The devaluation of the euro is most likely to happen due to the strengthening USdollar, not STG,.  Its a big world out there.  Currency, like everything else is affected by demand and supply.  and the Euro zone market place is far larger than one country, (ie UK), AND, I think you'll find some of the other currencies are pegged to the euro.  We're just not fooling ourselves.....and I think you'll find the French, Spanish and Italians might be a tad insulted by saying the Euro is the old mark    Hi jake, I believe there are talks to come up with a second Bretton Woods agreement, but i still believe the US dollar will recover enough, lets face it it did go extremely under valued.

uyfFGeMsaa	They don't really want Jerusalem as their capital.  What they really want is for the Jews NOT to have Jerusalem as their capital.    Muslims can't tolerate the idea that Jews are dominant, anywhere.  That's why they can't tolerate a Jewish state.  That's why they invented a "Palestinian" people distinct from the surrounding population that is culturally and ethnically almost indistinguishable.  That's why they invented the term "historic Palestine" to separate it from the rest of British Mandatory Palestine (which was 4-5 times bigger and included Jordan), so that it would just about fit perfectly over the whole state of Israel, and they could scream that the Jews stole Palestine.    If the Jews suddenly disappeared, Arabs would soon lose interest in Palestine, and Jerusalem would revert to the neglected backwater that it was before the advent of Zionism.  They want it because the Jews have it.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	why do they kill in the name of there false, so called god|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	Great question, its so true, Jerusalem was never the capital of any Arab entity. In fact, it was a backwater for most of Arab history. Jerusalem never served as a provincial capital under Muslim rule nor was it ever a Muslim cultural center. For Jews, the entire city is sacred, but Muslims revere a site  the Dome of the Rock  not the city. "To a Muslim," observed British writer Christopher Sykes, "there is a profound difference between Jerusalem and Mecca or Medina. The latter are holy places containing holy sites." Besides the Dome of the Rock, he noted, Jerusalem has no major Islamic significance.Jews have been living in Jerusalem continuously for nearly two millennia. They have constituted the largest single group of inhabitants there since the 1840's (map of Jerusalem in 1912) .Jerusalem contains the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.  The answer is the same, as to the reason they want Israel, which isnt theirs either.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The Jewish passion for the Holy City is revealed in the writings of King David:     "If I forget you O Jerusalem,  Let my right hand forget her cunning.  If I do not remember you,  Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth  If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy."      Palestinains     By Yasser Arafat and his thugs .....       "The jihad will continue ... You have to understand our main battle is Jerusalem ... It is not their capitol. It is our capitol."  Arafat speech in Johannesburg, South Africa, May 1994     "By Allah, I swear ... that the Palestinian people are prepared to sacrifice the last boy and the last girl so that the Palestinian flag will be flown over the walls, the churches and the mosques of Jerusalem."     The passion for the Dome of the Rock suggests that Palestinains are staunch Muslims, yet Palestinains are notoriously irreligious among Arabs. In any case, Islam respects the Biblewhich specifies the Jews right to the land. The Palestinains should respect it, since they claim to revere the Bible.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	1.they have no history tries to it?  Actual Palestinians are the descendants of the ancient Canaanites people who actually lived from Southern Palestine to Nothern Lebanon..  there were divided in many groups : arameans , phoenicians etc....Jerusalem is in the  Palestinian region ..      2. Not all Palestinians are Muslims , many are Christians  and Jerusalem has got a Muslim history as well as a Christian and Jewish one ...actually there is a big mosquee in Jerusalem who was built many centuries ago...      -EDIT-  Where do you think the Canaanites went , if they aren't actual Palestinians? .  This is completly a fact..  After the 7th century , Canaanites have been arabized by the Arab Empire , most of Canaanites adopted Bedoin (Arab's) language and Islam.....Jewish is not a race or a people , it's a religion...the Hebrew converted many people into Judaism when they migrated to Levant..untill the Jesus's times , when many people of Lebanon and Palestine converted themselves into Christianity , then in the 7th century Islam came and converted them into muslim's belief , but there are still many christian communities in Levant and also some Jewish ones..|`|77abb2cc3e4888ac26b17b7b44a5e008aa	Mohamed the prophet was raised by and learned from Jews and Christians.

K6zkGj7Zaa	Depends on what you are there for and what your taste in weather is.  Waimea (or Kamuela) is higher in altitude and is much cooler than the coast areas, you should bring a light jacket for night time.  The South West Side (Kona) is dry and sunny, the beaches are farther north.  Great snorkeling, fishing, kayaking.    The Big Island is just that, "BIG".  You can fit all of the other Hawaiian Islands into the Big Island.  It has All of the topography and climates that the others do too.  Rain Forest, Desert, Volcano (Active too), rolling hills, you name it.  There are beaches (white and black)  Cliffs and coves.  You can even stay in the Volcano National Park (Volcano House or Camp out)  There is a Military MWR site there too! (If you are Military)    There are resorts, hotels, condos, B &Bs, you can even camp out.    You should access the many tourist web sites (don't settle on any one), and pick up a guide book.  A really good one is:   Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook by Andrew Doughty     Remember to check out Rental Cars, you will need a car.    What ever you do, DO NOT take advice from people who's experience of Hawaii is Waikiki on Oahu.  That is not the real Hawaii.    Make sure you take plenty of time to enjoy your stay.  The standard one week (really 5 days plus 2 days for travel) is not enough.  Good Luck and have a great time!
AA12350023	although I respect "Alhamdullahs" response.. She has her experiences..  I beg to differ  My Saudi husband (and his other 6 brothers, he's from a large family) they are very pro-active in child rearing..  My husband was there with me when i had my 2.. he does so much for me and the children.. He does change diapers, he baths them, feeds them.. There was many a night also, he stayed up and walked the newborn just so I could sleep.. He was a dream back in those days.. He now is always willing to babysit when I need an evening out with my girlfriends (I am not a mother that uses foreign labor maids/nannys, im a do it yourself mother).. So if my husband is busy, then they are off to grandmothers house.. Our whole extended family is like that.. They all love babies and all are willing to lend a hand.   My daughter has her daddy wrapped around her little finger.. whatever she wants, he's there to give.. He likes to take them to the parks on Friday mornings before Jumah prayer, that gets them out of my way so I can do laundry and prepare stuff for the week ahead.. He plays a bit of play football with my son.. and he sits in the sand box at the parks and digs and builds sand castles with they kids.. I know it seems funny, but this is my husband..|`|cypZ0ykXaa	HI!! i'm not a saudi.neither do i know much 'bout the saudi men. but , its very gud to know frm mintee 'bout thier family & her hubby. and its so imp for a wife specially during the pregnancy period & post delivery time.|`|wTeJulT5aa	In general, men have nothing to do with taking care of the children.  They do play with the kids and have fun with them though...just no changing diapers or bathing them or making them food, etc.  Some men want to be more involved, but I think it's rare here in Saudi Arabia.  Actually, a lot of families have maids, which sometimes are basically a nanny for the kids.      Women give birth in hospitals, and the hospitals are very modern.  Some people choose to go to maternity hospitals that have hotel like suites you stay in for 2 days after having your baby.|`|dp2Rocjraa	i think its diffrent  from some husbands to others , i see a lot of men in the family for instance or people i know , some get very involved with the child , from bathing to diaper changes . and some just thing there job is to provide the child only .. but will raise him and play with him , but not help , with changing and so on .. so it really depends on the guy , what kind of guy he is .  hope ive helped :).

h1IYS0dbaa	There is one in Leysin (Switzerland):    http://www.american-college.com/front_co...    I know someone who went there.

It is considered one of the best american universities.|`|1W0Q95wZaa	I don't know American universities here in Switzerland. But the Swiss universities are among the best in the world.|`|uulh9ov1aa	Webster University in Geneva|`|ace9b0c85fe0b4936f055753c30719a7aa	I'm at JCU right now actually! It's fabulous, great profs not a lot of work and it definitely transfers back to the states! In rome there's also a campus for American university. But you know that already, there are few campuses up in Florence and I know UTSA has an architecture campus in Tuscany.      There's actually a lot of swiss in Rome, guys at least from the pontifical swiss guard at the vatican.  They're tons of fun and much more restrained than most of the men here.      It's probably easier to study in Italy, since a lot more italians speak english and there's just so many different languages and dialects in switzerland that it gets tricky. Like, I can understand a little german but when my friends speak in swiss german I am completely lost.      Best bet would be to talk to your study abroad advisor, because each school meets different needs.  Some are really only for italian and art history majors, while at others, like JCU, you can get a wider variety of credits.  Like i'm getting psychology credit, and my roommates are mostly doing international business, economics or management.  plus we have on-site classes where you are essentially toured around to the different historical spots and lectured there.  It's really fascinating and much more interesting than just doing a guided tour.

It is a gift card in the amount of what it cost to get in the park for a day. Or you can get a birthday fastpass. Both of them are only good on your birthday.

It was rough, but besides that we owed nothing else. In those days we saved up to buy anything we needed. I rented a TV, had no dishwasher or washing machine, so when the recession hit, we had nothing to loose. Luckily I kept my job but paid 48% tax and 7% pension and 8% PRSI, so my take home pay was miserable. Over the next 30 years thing improved  slowly until I retired in 2003.   Two years ago we put our first nest egg, both our SSSA's, into a BoI Evergreen Account, and agreed to continue saving the same amount ever since.   In December 2008, a Statement landed on the mat, telling us that our investment was worth less than 50% of the amount we had invested.  No explanation, no reason, except a line at the bottom which said that " Investments may go down as well as up "  It is no consolation to you, but personally, I think things are going to get worse before it will get better.|`|XMTG2XlXaa	Yes it is bad everywhere.|`|JsfSS1o8aa	do you watch the news theres a global rescission at the moment|`|sOi98doYaa	Things are looking very grim at the moment, the 80's won't be a patch on this one I think.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Draw the dole of course|`|62RKtkOhaa	sounds pretty tough out there for you. sorry to hear it BUT everywhere is going through a tough time - tho not as bad as you.

My friend (Its a long story) broke her leg in the summer but as she was a sole trader hasn't received one cent since around August.  She has no job still.    I have a job, wont lose it but now I stand to lose another 160 euro a month, along with the pension, levy, and tax.  The tax will go up this year, probably by May or June.  I am so annoyed as they haven't ditched the junior minsters, the TDs had the cheek to try and get a pay rise (they're not getting it now) and wont give themselves another pay cut.  They don't care!    I guess everyone has a story of their own to tell.  But at some point things will improve.
eD7qRBKHaa	You can buy multi-day tickets from Disney which will get you into Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios.  You can add-on the option to also get into the water parks, Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.    Then you will have to buy your Universal tickets from Universal.  They also have multi-day tickets which will get you into their two parks, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.      You won't be able to find an all-encompassing tickets, because the competitors don't work together to produce these.    You need to figure out how many days you wish to spend at each park and get multi-day tickets for that.  You save a lot of money by buying these.

They will hide in a doorway or around a corner and watch for someone pulling in one minute early, or arriving one minute after the meter runs out.
CoIDVbnxaa	my brothers friend who is moroccan, he married a girl from morocco. and it has taken him a year to get visa and everything sorted.  its a long process and is costly and very frustrating from what i have heard. exact reason why i wont marry a moroccan man, and the fact that the likely reason they marry you is for papers as every moroccan is aware of, im moroccan i knwo this all too well from what i have seen.  good luck      you can work in morocco if you have a profession, a teacher but you need arabic and you need qualifications and proof.   well its really hard to tell with these men, moroccans have what we call emotional inteligence. they can pull at your heart strings and make you believe anything. i know its been tryed on me before. iv also been told by moroccan men, who say they marry western women, they get a visa, money a better life, live in the west and the women most of whom are divourced or mature get a young handsome man who loves them for bringing them to the west. and for these women thats adequete enough.   on eman i spoke to said he loved her for that reason alone and becuase of that he will stay with her and not leave her becuase she is paying for everything, flights, wedding etc etc. He was very honest with me, and i hear it all the time when i am in morocco about how men met girls on holiday or online and that they will take them back to the UK or america, its really sad and decitful.   Iv seen it all my life and i wont marry a moroccan from morocco. even if he has a good job they cant live here unless they have a visa and alot want to come for the life, freedom and enjoy western society.  any devout muslim man would hate to live in the west, everything haram surrounding him. thats how i know a genuine moroccan man from a liar.   anyways good luck. and be careful     jazakallah khier|`|f1NBiKDGaa	all i can say is that it will take more than one week to get the overall certificate.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	I married my husband in Morocco in 2006.

So many days we went to offices that decided not to be open that day, and when they were open they were not at all helpful.  I know how frustrating this all is.

That way you don't have to wait a year to get him over there with you.|`|qJkKP2c3aa	My friend is marrying. She has her certificate of no impediment. She returned tuesday! She now has her CRBC  (police check)   Yes you could possibly do it in the inbetween days in Morocco  but in my experience  you either have to wait a long time only to be told to return the next day, or the person you need to see is not there. You can make a provisional appointment and hope they keep to that day. Its because Morocco is so laid back and truly everything is inchallah.    My friend will return for 3 weeks in order to ensure all papers are completed. She has the added problem that her husband to be lives in Marrakech, works all week but has to go to Rabat to the Embassy  it cannot be done at the consulate in Marrakech.    Give yourself plenty of time in Morocco to sort things and get married if you can get the time from work. And you know that just because you are married it does not entitle your husband automatic access to the UK? this has happened to 2 of my colleagues - one of whom has waited 7 months and is still not over here yet.  However, dont lose hope "if you want it you can get it"  By the way, what type of work do you do? i may beable to give you direction to English speaking employers - email me.  Best wishes.    In answer to  Lyndsey G : just because you obtain a fiancee visa, doesnt aytomatically allow residency in the  UK. A fiancee visa may or may not petmit entry to the UK when he arrives, and most certainly - if one marries on a fiancee visa does not allow a person to stay longer than the said 6 months. However following marriage, when the husband hass returned to Morocco  he may apply for a multiple entry visa while he is awaiting his spouse visa. He will still have to wait months or more to e allowed to stay yearly.|`|mjBMJfJIaa	Salam Allykum, from my experience you should not leave your job, this is a hard thing to replace in these hard economic times, unless you are going to move there. Just ask for a week or two off to do the things you need to do, or ask for a leave of absence for a month.   All Moroccan men dont just want papers, this is not true. A few bad men dont mean all men are like this. There are some good men in this world. I know America has the fiance visa, does the UK have this also?  It is a nice place with lots to see in Morocco and the people are great and friendly, but the economy is poor and you cant find a job. This is the reality. Im trying to get my husband his visa for America so i can go back someday. Also, right now we are working on my Moroccan residency card, cause after living in Morocco six months he can get his visa for the US in one week after. Maybe the UK is like this? It is called Direct Consular Filing.  Hope this helps.

ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	So, apply for a visitor's visa.    Just so you know, though, you would not be able to work while you're in Canada and you would have to satisfy immigration officials that you would be leaving at the end of your visit.    Don't take it wrong but it's just that there are a number of people who wrongly believe that they can work while visiting here or that they can apply to immigrate to Canada while they're here or to extend their visitor's visa. Immigration officials keep a keen lookout for things like that and so you may face a wary eye or two.

24cCxnpzaa	Hey Bahama is very nice place to visit especially for couples. And Winter Haven is awesome place for stay, its reasonable, royal and you can do many things at one place and they have very good arrangements for their guests. And Long Island is considered to be the best place and most beautiful island of Bahamas and Winter Haven is exactly situated over there. And I believe you should definitely consider Winter Haven on your mind before you choose any resorts.|`|AA11613031	Hi,  there are plenty of great deals now with all the cruise lines ~   The later yoiu book a trip the better the deal.  They have always been running specials to fill up the ship !  I saved over $500.00 last year when I booked a week before the trip cause,  they needed another 260 passangers !  I saved a bundle and you'll save a lot more if, you take an inside cabin rather than get a balcony.  Good luck searching & have a great trip ~  Joel
16EYP0Xiaa	Hi,  My answer would depend on how long you have for your trip.  This is because it's about 500 miles from San Diego to San Francisco. Not knowing what traffic is like in LA, it could take a very long day to make the drive. If you only have a few days for your vacation, IMHO spending one of them to do this drive doesn't make much sense.    Have you thought about flying? Southwest Airlines has many daily nonstop flights to the S.F. Bay Area...with fares as low as $59 one way. The San Diego Airport is right near downtown, and can even be reached by bus. From San Diego it only takes about 90 minutes to fly to San Francisco, Oakland, or San Jose.    If your are mainly going to see San Francisco, I'd say you don't need a car, especially if you are unaccustomed to driving and finding parking in a very congested place like Manhattan or Boston.     San Francisco has pretty good public transportation [BART light rail, buses]. BART connects both the San Francisco and Oakland airports. [the SF airport has a BART station at the airport, while the Oakland airport has a free shuttle to the BART station located nearby]    If you are going to spend several days in the Bay Area and want a car. You can always leave your car at a BART station and take BART into San Francisco. That's usually what we do.    Have a great trip!|`|sJ7GzZLbaa	I would say rent a car or take the train. Renting a car is probably your best bet because you can go at your own pace, stop when you need to, etc. the train is more convinient because there is no driving required, you can drink and do whatever you want, it takes longer than driving though because it stops along the way. you might want to look into amtrak and see if it goes that far north|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	It depends on how much time you have.    Flying is the best way - 80 minute flight    By car: it's a long drive any there are two options: I-5 and CA-101.  I-5 is BORING! It goes through the central valley and will take several hours. 101 is more coastal and takes longer. If you diverge and take Highway 1, you'll be traveling along Big Sur, and some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. (Check out Hearst Castle if you have the time)    For a unique romantic experience, the train is great. The tracks run up the coast. SD to LA is the Surf Line Route. From LA it's The Coast Starlight, one of the great passenger train rides in the world. The tracks are right on the ocean cliffs for a good portion of the way. It will take all day, and can run late, but it's a great ride.
lcj1AKt1aa	Here is some information.    TRAVEL  OF  MINOR        1. Non-accompanied minors under 18 years-old, or minors who travel with someone who is not the mother or the father, or with a relative whose family name is not the same, must have a letter of parental consent into spanish signed by at least one of the parents.        2.

AA11937736	I defer to ChocoBN on the issue of hostels but I would suggest that staying anyplace other than the center of Paris, especially on a very short stay, isn't worth the savings.    Even a short Metro or bus ride eats up valuable time. Stay in the center and you may well walk everywhere.    If you're in the center then a short downpour that soaks your clothes and leaves your footwear squishy with water or a change in temperature that leaves you shivering or sweltering is taken care of by a short walk back to your hotel to change.     Its easier to find evening entertainment and to enjoy it without worrying about catching the last Metro or having to navigate the night bus system.     I could go on about this but you get the idea.    In any case, if you reconsider then consider any of the following Hotels.    My favorite is the Hotel St. Andre des Arts that I've stayed in dozens of times over the last several decades. ( http://www.france-hotel-guide.com/h75006... ) The location is perfect. Its short walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Place St. Michel, Luxembourg Gardens, Cluny Museum, Sainte Chapelle and a host of other sights. Its in a very lively area filled with cafes, bars and restaurants with a wide range of prices. Its across the street from Le Mazet where Jim Morrison had his last drink and around the corner from the oldest restaurant in Paris. There's a daily street market on the next block.  At 91  for a double (includes breakfast and taxes) its more than twice as expensive as ChocoBN's hostel but the difference in total cost over 4 nights doesn't really amount to much.    Some other inexpensive centrally located hotels are::    Hotel des Allies http://www.alliesparishotel.com/  Hotel de Nesle http://www.hoteldenesleparis.com/  Hotel de Rouen http://www.hotelderouen.net/index.htm|`|RrEESD6Paa	I don't think you can find anything actually "cheap" in Paris, but you may be able to find some great deals just outside of the city... that's what I always do when I go there. I would recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck and check out the link below.|`|PHpVr8raaa	This place will meet all your criteria: http://www.cisp.fr/cisp/index.asp?ln=us  Out of the two centers, Maurice Ravel is the better one. Price is 39.10 for a single room with private bathroom and breakfast, much cheaper if you share. I have stayed there, it is clean and perfect (although closer to the outskirts of Paris than the center but the mtro is a couple of blocks away).    Otherwise some B&Bs can be as low as 30:  http://www.abritel.fr/uk/detail.php?wety...  http://www.homelidays.com/EN-Holidays-Re...  As prices are normally for 2 people, you should be able to negociate 5 off for single occupancy since there will be only one breakfast. At 39/person, this lady gets the best ratings and is a little closer to the center (you could even walk): http://www.homelidays.com/paris-11/bedan...      EDIT: I don't know what you mean by cheap so I gave you the cheapest that are still clean and reliable (some super cheap hotels in very central Paris have terrible beds or screw up with reservations, which can be an issue in June as it's the busy season) but if you can afford more, I agree with Rillifane that staying in a more central location (ideally 3rd to 6th/ eastern 7th arrondissements) is much better.     Hi Rillifane,   I just wanted to clarify that the CISP centers are not hostels, they actually feel more like those large chain hotels : that same clean, modern, sleek but charmless, standardized decor (without the carpet), mostly single and double rooms rather than dorms, only difference is rooms are tiny and have no amenities (no TV, minibar, hair-dryer nor in-room wifi) but a better than average breakfast  - for France - and all taxes are included. Unfortunately, they're not in central arrondissements...|`|Q6XYkUUNaa	1. Join the YHA.  2.

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola!  Well I think Cabo is definately the better party place.  It has become quite popular in the past while, as lots of celebrities like to jet down for the weekends here.    We have several nightclubs all within a few blocks of each other.  I usually make my way from each until the wee hours in the morning.  Each bar has its own thing that makes it fun.  Some have dance shows, some live music, some for dancing on tables.  My favorites are Cabo Wabo, El Squid Roe, Gigglin Marlin, and I also like Barmetro.    I think the only reason people would pick Puerto Rico is because they don't want to leave the umbrella of the USA.  Cabo is in Mexico and therefore you should expect to act like you are in a different country.    oh and p.s. August through October is the quieter season, but weekends rock!|`|jLnXuam7aa	I went to Cabo in Oct 08 and the club and nightlife was dead and this was my fourth time in Cabo, in years before it was always great but with the economy a lot less people are in cabo|`|sZGzUmLDaa	cabo because you can buy more and spend less than puerto rico|`|tmkc9UPMaa	Well i dont know if my opinion is biased because im from mexico and well i will tell you that cabo san lucas is better although i ve been to puerto rico and it was really good but cabo san lucas has a better night life and there are great pubs, beaches, food, etc.   Im sorry if i didnt help or if you didnt understand my english   and well i dont know where you are going to decide to go but i hope you enjoy it whatever your decision is.|`|q1RSJu4Saa	I do say cabo san lucas its a great place to be in with the family!!    hands down for cabo!

KS2OHXCRaa	It is illegal to work in Ireland on a tourist visa. You could most likely attend interviews here on a business visa basis and accept the job if offered, but you cannot legally work until you have the required work permit.     Currently work permits are hard to come by, and employers who want to hire outside of Ireland and EU/EEA zone will be required to put through advertisings etc to make sure that this position cannot be filled by Irish/EU/EEA first, then only can they put through a work permit application. Not only that, certain jobs and of certain salary scale are not even eligible for work permit applications at the moment.    For information on work permits please check this link : http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego...    Please note that Indian nationals are visa-requiring nationals. (http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=877... )      * Update *  Even if you get a job offer, this is not a guarantee on the work permit. Work permit is issued by the Dept of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Your (future) employer could try to obtain a permit for you, as long as they've met all the criteria - that the job is not under the list of jobs ineligible for work permit and that they have tried to find the best candidate from the pool of Irish/EU/EEA employees but unable to find one. However the assessment lies with the Dept of Enterprise. If they refuse to issue the work permit, there's not much your employer can do either.    To be honest, this is a lot of hassles and many employers would rather not be involved with it. On top of that, there's an application/processing fees of 1000euro, which is a lot of money. Unless this job that you're applying for is a specialised ones, it's going to be hard to find an employer who's willing to jump all the hoops in order to secure a work permit for non-EEA citizen.    If you intend to apply for any of the jobs below, you can for now forget about it. There will not be any work permits issued for these categories. You will be wasting your time and resources, and wasting the potential employer's time and resources as well.    From 1 February 2007 work permits are not available for the following occupations.        * Clerical and administrative staff      * General operatives and labourers      * Operator and production staff      * Retail sales staff, sales representatives and supervisory or specialist sales staff      * Drivers (excluding HGV)      * Nursery/crche workers, child minders/nannies      * Hotel, tourism and catering staff except chefs       * The following craft workers and apprentice/trainee craft workers: bookbinders, bricklayers, cabinet makers, carpenters/joiners, carton makers, fitters - construction plant, electricians, instrumentation craftspeople, fitters, tilers - floor/wall, mechanics - heavy vehicles, instrumentation craftspersons, metal fabricators, mechanics - motor, originators, painters and decorators, plumbers, printers, engineers - refrigeration, sheet metal workers, tool makers, vehicle body repairers, machinists - wood, plasterers and welders    Seriously, read the link that I've provided above.

Before the American financial catastrophe, Ireland was one of the fastest growing economies in the EU. The Irish accomplished this by using Polish immigrants who found they could earn twice the salary in Ireland. Unfortunately, the Irish developed too much too fast. When the credit markets collapsed, economic growth stopped. The irish are once again leaving their country seeking better jobs elsewhere. Ironically, western business is now moving to eastern Europe because of low labor costs.|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	its illegal without visa/work permit and most places will check you have those - even places where before you could get work under the table such as restaurants and pubs are now more strict about that.

UF8qU5cGaa	They are not bankrupt, but they do have serious financial problems. There's a very real difference between the two.     Besides, a country can never really go "bankrupt". The IMF will not "own" Iceland if they fail to pay their loans.    The solution is simple and follows other countries: less government spending, fewer services and higher prices. People will have to get used to lower wages, higher taxes and unemployment.    Iceland has already taken the first steps to recovery, their Nordic neighbors have already lent them substantial amounts of money/credit. And the IMF has given them a few billion dollars in loans.    Now they just need to let the dust settle, let the unhealthy businesses die and get absorbed by healthier competitors. People have lost their jobs, and will have to find or create new ones.    Already many Icelandic people have decided to or have left for other countries in Europe where they can find jobs. My own country, Norway, has received a considerable number.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	For that particular journey, underground is your best bet.    In terms of getting around London in general, walking is always good!  It's good to check on a map how far things really are.  What might be two tube stops might only be a ten minute walk ... so you'd be saving time, money, and not missing any sights!    Buses are a bit crap to be honest.  There is too much traffic for them to cover long distances quickly.  As far as I'm concerned, the only thing buses are good for is at night after the tubes have stopped running, or for those in the suburbs who live too far from a station to walk.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Underground is definately your best bet.

Exit left out of the station, walk up Villiers Street, Cross the Strand, walk to the right then go up any of the side streets to the left and you'll get to Covent Garden.    Best thing to do is to purchase an Oyster card and top it up as a pay as you go card and then you can use it on any bus or tube by tapping it on the reader at the gate or on the reader as you board the bus.    For more information go to www.tfl.gov.uk|`|AA12370221	Cari is right, it is often easier to walk.  The other option is to use a black cab taxi, especially if you are carrying a case and don't want all those corridors and steps on the underground.  and crowds.|`|bda465ikaa	For zone 1 (central London) it is a good idea to have a map with true distances, and not the standard circuit map. You must change tube lines to go from Victoria to Covent Garden, but it is only about a 600 yard walk from Embankment Station.  ---------  In general, the covent garden station can get very crowded. It is not served by escalators, only elevators. At peak times, they advise people to disembark at other stations and walk to Covent Garden.
zOyWCvqtaa	I've met quite a few Poms (our name for English people) during my time and there are mixed reviews.  Australia is generally cheaper and cleaner than London and has a different more relaxed culture.  In saying that there are plenty of "cultured" places to visit, especially in Melbourne.  I agree with the previous contributor in saying you should visit in summer to see if you can handle the heat, I've lived here all my life and hate the heat.  You will find in many places the way of life is a little slower than London, though Sydney and Melbourne are close to matching it.  you will find the suburbs of most cities are different to the main city itself os for example in sydney CBD there are crowds and overpriced coffee e.t.c and just fast busy and rude people (like in London haha) bit out here in the outer suburbs things are slower and people are more friendly...slightly (I live about 40km from Sydney city itself).  Our cities are also more spread out with urban sprawl than in Europe as well, you can take over 1 hour by train or car and still be in Sydney (granted the suburbs), for example.  A lot of english people fall in love with the place and never want to move back and then are those who can't handle it and get back to the Old Dart ASAP.  Come over for a working or study holiday at first and get a feel for the place before making any decisions.  Also keep in mind that Australia is huge and it takes a while to travel between places, e.g. a flight from Sydney to Melbourne takes 1 hour, car 8 hours, train 12 hours.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	In general it's much cheaper in Australia though I've heard recently prices have become more comparable.

So, try it, you will love it, but don't go the whole hog straight away... because you might be surprised at how different it is, especially to london.

You do not specify where in England you want to fly to so I will assume it is London.    Cologne Bonn (It is the airport in Koln) to London Gatwick is your one option. The flight is operated by easyJet. You can also fly from Cologne Bonn to London Stansted and this flights are operated by German Wings (http://www.low-cost-airline-guide.com/)    Let's start with Koln - Gatwick flight.  As I said, it is operated by easyJet.  The flights are operated daily and if you want to fly pretty much now the price is close to 100 Euros.

However, I do know that I checked into many hotels in NYC without anyone ever asking for Id. And I am not much older then you.    Ussualy, as long as you hand them a credit card, they probably dont care how old you are. Its not a federal law like drinking age, its more of a descion made by the hotel itself. So its not always enforced.|`|PdBOR3OSaa	I would say no as long as u have  drivers licence and a major credit card enjoy your Night In NYC|`|FCCkrhozaa	These are some of the hotels that allow 18 year old's.

LXKTZSU0aa	You usually will be fine for the month of april. By that time things have started to heat back up around here. Hopefully this unusually cold winter will be outta here. Also you may want to try out some of the natural springs around the area as well. Where the gulf fluctuates in temperature, the springs stay at 72 degrees all year round. Clear water is a good choice for vacationing...what you can't find in Clearwater you can easily find in Tampa of St. Pete.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Last year I went to Zephyr hills in March and I know Clearwater is farther south and the weather was great.  I am sure the weather will be fine in April to go swimming in.|`|0gdBjXb1aa	my aunt usually goes to clear water in mid-march...you might not feel like swimming, but i think it's comfortably warm|`|fPiL88XLaa	I grew up on Clearwater Beach, and there is no better time in Florida then April and May, these months make for a perfect beach day, it is not cool and most important not tooo HOT.  The Gulf is warmer then the Atlantic, so if your used to swimming in April on the East coast, you will be fine.  It is Feb, and though today we have unusually cold weather, Monday calls for a high of 78' - in April the High averages mid to high 80's and low 70's at night, it is always beach weather in Florida.

cowXmiP3aa	My Mother & 2 younger sisters live there & they love it though it is a bit off the beaten track, there are frequent trains though & is very handy for the Lake District.|`|4786d32b584fcb26c69f4fab5c440db6aa	It is out on a limb and awkward to get in and out of. The main road in and out is the A590  and it is notorious for accidents.    If you really want to live near the Lakes, then Kendal is very beautiful with good shopping. It is also on M6 so it is easy to get to Carlisle, Penrith and even Glasgow is only 2 hours away.     To the south you have Lancaster, Preston and even Manchester all on the M6.    It can take an hour driving along the A590 to get to the M6 especially if you get stuck behind a slow moving vehicle. I think this will bug you after a while.|`|AA11349530	I don't know the place that well, I've visited that's all ... it's quite off the beaten track ... it's near to the Lake District but it's not in it, which probably means you have the advantages of the area without the tourists ... it's an ex-industrial town (shipbuilding etc) but that has run down now ... it's got a fairly good shopping area for a relatively small town, I think a lot of people in the surrounding area must come into Barrow for shopping ... it struck me as the sort of place that's a fairly relaxed, slow pace of life but probably not all that good if you were looking for a job ... it has good transport links but it takes a bit of time to get to anywhere
LXKTZSU0aa	Flagler Beach on the East coast of Florida would be a nice place or Ormond beach. The are right between Daytona and St. Augustine. So you could visit the larger cites if you wanted but wouldn't have to be stuck in them. Plus with it being on the atlantic side you would get the good beaches with nice sand and good waves that you would be hard to find on the west coast of Florida.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	If you wait until hurricane season I bet the waves will be big enough.  lol
ZaadvJAXaa	This time of year, it is cold.  The summers are mild, but it can get hot.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Not really.  They have long winters and short summers.  Cold winters and hot summers.|`|1CVOHoapaa	It is and it is also ice cold in Alex|`|F3WjMOgOaa	during the winter it is.  they get lots of lake effect weather.  it is normal to have 3+ inches of snow, and it will last for days.  If there is not 6+ inches, the chances of school being closed is very small.  summers are usually hot.  Humidity for the most part is around 70-80%.    It storms often, but they will not last long.  It is very different to the UK.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yes it does get cold here. In the Winter time mainly and it starts to be cool in the Fall/Autumn. Summers it can get about in the high 80's low 90's and Spring it is just comfortable where you can wear shorts and capris. I live in Missouri which is right next to IL and their weather is about the same. They do get lots of tornadoes by the IL and MO border. (Trust me, when we are scared where we live the storms usually jump over us and touch down and IL, it is so close that when my mom and I went to a candy store we heard tornado sirens going off and we panicked and ran to the car, we were so scared by it was in IL) They also can get earthquakes, last year they did (I think it was in IL but I woke up 4:37am and everything in my room was moving, I live in Missouri but I felt it, it was strange but cool) This is pretty much everything you can expect there.

xSHRJw46aa	We have both flown and driven to Orlando to see the Mouse.  Frankly, I love it as a family trip.    We have always stayed 'off-site' and used a car.    The bad news is, there really are no bargain tickets.  The only time we have had 'bargain' tickets is a long time ago when we got single day passes for going to a time share presentation.  Yuck.  I think that you can get a small AAA discount.    I think that you best bet is to buy your tickets online from the official Disney World site, and pick them up when you get there.  The way the pricing works now, the first couple of days in the parks cost a small fortune, but the last few days are literally pennies.      From the category of personal preferences, I always like to have the park hopper option.  We end up park hopping almost every day.  Stopping at the car in the middle of the day is also a no-impact way to save a few bucks on food and drinks.  You can grab a soda out of the trunk and enjoy it as you move on to the next park.  You can also grab a water bottle to carry back in.  We have even been known to eat our lunch out of a cooler in the car as we drive to the next park.  It is not that bad if you consider it part of the adventure.  It does save my family of 4 about $40-50 per day for lunch food.    Read more tips at the site below.    I wish I had better news, but I hope this helped.|`|PdBOR3OSaa	wow That a hard to answer I would say that if u are a Member of the militery u can get a discount on the tickets or if you have a AAA card you get a discount on tickets.      too bad you can't take advange of the buy 4 night get 3 nights free with park tickes include .! that deal is on till june 29 but u must book by March 29, 2009|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Disney doesn't do discounts. There are lots of scams out there, so I suggest you buy either from Disney or an authorized discount dealer only.

BJIo6twUaa	I enjoyed hawaii. I miss the island. I was stationed there for 6 years when i was in the Air Force. I didnt have any problems, but i adjust well to my surroundings.  If you have a job lined up, that is one good thing there because hawaii is very expensive.     Things about culture, Key things to remember when in hawaii, if you go to someone house to visit, it is custom to take your shoes off, usually people bring food when it comes to outings/get togethers.     Over all i didnt have much of a culture shock, i just enjoyed the island. The only thing i didnt like about it was the traffic. Lots of traffic on the island.    But i could recommend visiting first incase you dont care too much for being on the island, some people get island fever and just dont like living on an island. I was stationed with a few people that were like that.|`|mIPxH501aa	no, you should have a look, if someone else likes does not mean that you will like it also, so go and visit it and then make your decision.|`|AA12361841	yes go! if you are not effecting any one else life GO! you only live once and what's the worse that can happen? You move back?  I do know it is very expensive there so make sure you are looking at your salary against the cost of living there. Blessings*|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Do your research online, and if you like what you read, take the job! :-) Most importantly, research which island you'll be moving to.    This is ultimately your decision.|`|fHNOiZP0aa	The adventurer in my says you should just do it, and really, life won't turn upside down and explode if you do.  BUT Hawaii is a different place.  I went there and did like some of it, and didn't like others.  It depends on what island you're going to.  Also, consider things like weather.  Do you like constant high humidity?      Why don't you do this.  Take a vacay from your current job, go to Hawaii and try to decide in a week if you like it or not, if you do...continue to work in Hawaii and call your other job to say you're not coming back.  Irresponsible....meh...who cares, it's your friggin life we're talkin' about, live a little!

One lady told me that Phoenix was "a bend in the road." (route 66)|`|UppsoSZPaa	My best guess is that was a fraction of the size it is now.
