ncojw5ttaa	It's amazing!!! I've gone to places I never knew existed because of the Phantom. Their reviews are very acurate. I trust them for all my restaurant needs!!<br>  <br>  The Phantom Gourmet Food Festival that they host every year is a blast! There's so much good food and lots of fun. Everyone wears purple and they have all kinds of silly contests. They also have the BBQ Beach Party in the summer.|`|07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	I think he is the only honest reviewer. The others on TV go in announcing that they are from some TV station and are handed complimentary meals. Big surprise - those other reviewers always say that free food is the greatest they have ever eaten.<br>  <br>  Phantom goes in anonymously and pays for his food. When he says it is good you can believe it.|`|46GLUOrraa	its fabulous!|`|AA11732565	Phantom? Barely, everyone at the restaurants knows the Andelman Brothers...<br>  Gourmet? Not really. Mac and cheese, packaged cocoa, burgers,chips and chinese food (usually at the Kowloon which is okay) are the current preoccupations of this trio. They host a Saturday night radio show and judging by their choice of restaurants, I'd say they should hire me to do the job right.<br>  Oh yeah, sorry - I forgot pizza. Add it to their groaning board!|`|CLm2dX1faa	I love the Phantom I think they do a great in reviews and are quite honest. I lived in Boston my whole life and find their reviews to be the best. They really do not favor any particular restaurant. Maybe except fuddruckers ( I hate fuddruckers)|`|5c936a54fb80e00b663741498162c091aa	<a href="http://www.yelp.com/topic/boston-phantom-gourmet-show" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com/topic/boston-phantom...</a><br>  <br>  thats your answer.|`|AA10727777	Very Amazing, i have found places that i have never known exist in boston|`|MU7DVCkJaa	i think its excellent it shows you many excellent locations yay i love good food
gaXUIduMaa	The advertising slogan needs to be catchy and either new or such that it brings in business.  They hold surveys to tell when a slogan is becoming meaningless and will change it.  Sometimes they do it on a regular basis others will wait until it looses its punch.  Companies will spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for a good slogan, logo, tune and whatever.  If it works, expect them to keep it for at least a couple years, if it doesn't work, it could be out in 3 months.|`|SzFxztyyaa	Because change is good and you want to keep people interested in your business. Businesses change marketing tactics all the time and like I said it's to keep people interested.|`|LmFGYK7laa	because they felt like it ....... hahaaa|`|TZzkJHbaaa	its a secret :)|`|WaIE6KZVaa	cuz my favorite color is pink|`|AA12221820	i knoe where i live its rallys now..|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Change is important.<br>  Maybe they found something better to describe their food.<br>  Now just gotta wait for McDonalds to change their slogan.
EwzM7EEaaa	Hey, I worked at Tim's about a year and a half ago.<br>  They didn't do a background check on me, however they did ask for a reference and they DID give them a call.<br>  I had 1 quick, 15 minute interview and then next thing i knew i was hired.<br>  My starting wage was 8.35$, i got a raise (of 15 cents... ) after 3 months<br>  <br>  It was really quite simple to get the job, I think I applied online, got a call, then within a week of the call I had an interview, I was hired shortly after.<br>  When you get hired you're supposed to watch like a ton of training videos, teaching you all the do's and don'ts of Timmies. But I referred my friend to work there and he was hired and never had to watch the training videos

Plenty of bars just around the corner from there to choose from too on Queen Street. Have fun :-)|`|KTj3z0loaa	The nightlife is fantastic, the front is full of bars and such and they look really fun.<br>  Plus there are loads of hotels to stay in too so if you get drunk you only have to stumble a few feet to your hotel lol.<br>  But yeah the nightlife is brilliant there's pubs and clubs everywhere!|`|ItXgAoo4aa	I've heard it is ok.
