20090221030324AA2jM7k	Environment;Global Warming	Global Warming Question!!!?	To extent does the sun cause global warming?, i'm not convinced that we are the main contributors to global warming, i.e. the polar icecaps of Mars are receding at several miles a year, much faster than ours and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting, in fact several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas - how are SUV's causing that, all these planets are further away from the sun. I don't deny we are exacerbating the conditions of global warming but I believe the government are giving us false information to feed are minds to, persuade us that global warming is of increasing nature and purely down to are own faults, for their own benefit e.g. to push green taxes etc.

20090221041952AARfoGj	Environment;Global Warming	Where are the top five global warming destinations?	CNN International, says, (updated 9:57 am,EST, Tue. Feb. 17, 2009, "Five places to go before global warming messes them up: New Orleans "COULD" be in trouble from rising sea levels. First of all New Orleans is under sea level to begin with, and flooding there has nothing to do with so called global warming.    Glaciers in the Alps "MAY" melt in the middle of the century. "MAY" melt there is a strong fact?!?!   Encouraged by warm winters, pine beetles are ruining forests in Colorado. Therefore they claim warm winters, global warming indirectly causes a living form to cause global warming, eating up forests. Therefore global warming takes the credit, pine beetles off the hook!?!?!?    Bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where algae in the coral die and leave white skeletons,  (and other reefs all over the world).    Since they have shown that fish still eat these new white skeletons and strive, why is that bad?    Then the deforestation of the Amazon Rain Forest, Brazil, cutting down trees. Well they should of never cut so many trees to begin with, and should of planted trees to replenish these missing trees, that is recycling, and has nothing to do with global warming, but has to do with the quality of air, for breathing, animals, humans.    Are these the "Top Five" global warming destinations?

20090221012705AArOIkO	Environment;Global Warming	Why are there so many climate change deniers here?	Why don't you believe global warming is real? The best answer will be the one that actually gives me a good answer with some things to back it up or a good argument :). Personally i think its real and it maybe already to late to stop it. But i want to know from people who believe its a hoax why? Honest answers don't just say because your mummy told you or because you are stuck in the past and think greenies are stupid. Also add where you come from :) I live in regional Australia.

20090221015134AA9byTA	Environment;Green Living	How green am I..........?	 http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculato...       This is not meant to be bragging on myself.  The aforementioned question is simply one that has been asked more and more lately.      -Maintenance:  I use ponies as a lawnmower.  They are even more precise than a weed-eater around edges.  I use their manure in my compost.  Plus, there is no labor involved for mowing, and they make interesting pets.      -Energy: I have a wood-stove for heat, which is quite efficient and keeps my electricity bill below $60 in the winter, even with more electronics than I should probably have running and having Christmas lights for a month.  I use the equivalent of one to two trees for heat each winter.      I now have energy saving light bulbs in almost every room (the most used rooms).  I use only what lights are necessary at the moment.         -Transportation: My car can get over 30 mpg, while still performing adequately.  I’ve added extra upgrades (air filter, muffler, cold air intake, etc,) that are supposed to make it more efficient.  I do notice a difference in fuel consumption since the upgrades have been added (along with some slight performance bonuses).      I use tires which have the highest treadwear rating (they last a long time, even with having good traction).      -Consumables: The house has it’s own well, with it’s own pressure filter.  I have a Brita filter pitcher, and use water from the well for drinking water.  I use reusable bottles when it is required to have water afar (hiking and stuff).      I am starting my first garden this year.  I am using my own compost from kitchen scraps, manure, leaves, etc.      -Garbage: This is my worst environmental aspect.  Even though we recycle glass, aluminum, and plastic, we have no trash service so we burn our remaining garbage.  I would like to build some kind of incinerator/burning pit that has at least a make-shift filter on it to reduce my air pollution.      -Influence: I have spread influence over my family.  My father has bought a hydrogen generator for his truck.  He requires a rather large truck for his job.  My family utilizes his truck as “the family’s truck” so that it is all that is necessary for the entire family to complete big tasks.  My parents also have energy saving light bulbs... not to mention that my father works for a clean energy industry.      -Future Plans: I am very interested in building a mini-windmill.  If it produces enough power to nearly power my two-bedroom house, I might build a few more and make profit from them... if I can afford one at all.

20090221040107AAiMpmT	Environment;Global Warming	Is there a lack of collective will regarding tackling climate change?	There is nothing We (Humanity) need to combat climate change (technology-wise) that isn't already at our disposal.      Wind turbines, solar cells, solar furnaces, hydroelectricity, wood, etc. are all at our disposal. I find it insane that no single country has seized the initiative and thrown itself into this project. The outcome is such vast, free energy supply that most countries would not only be self-sufficient with regards to energy needs, but be major exporters too.      There's no point in a country aspiring to take over the World if there's nothing left in the end.

Our teacher has given us an assessment task where we have to write a magazine article on 'Saving Our Planet!'   I was wondering if anyone could help me make my magazine article better, or give me tips/links.   Here is what we are supposed to do:      Task:   Write a magazine article on 'Saving our planet!'   Your magazine article must include the following points:   ? An introduction   ? A description of what global warming is   ? An analysis of the causes of global warming and the impact is it having on our planet   ? A description of how one biome is being affected by global warming (think about how it is being affected now, and also what may happen in the future)   ? Ideas of what can/must be done to slow down or stop global warming.      We also got a grading sheet which tells us what we should do to get an A*, A, B*,  and so on:      For and A* (I’m hoping to achieve this level)   ? The process of global warming is explained fully, identifying the source/causes of the problem- makes fully integrated use of diagrams & graphs   ? Impacts of global warming are categorized and fully explained, making reference to what/who they will affect   ? A relevant biome is chosen and the impacts of global warming on that biome are fully explained and analysed (both human and environmental impacts must be considered)   ? A range of realistic proposals for reducing global warming are given and described fully, these will include what both individuals and organizations can do to reduce their impact on the environment.   ? Work is presented in an appropriate format.   ? Work includes ideas beyond what is covered in class.      I would be thankful to any ideas or links. This is a very important task as it will cover 15% of our overall grade mark, so please help me!      Thank you
20090203092158AASwxqk	Environment;Global Warming	Why are Republicans so out of touch with scientists when it comes to global warming?	A recent Rasmussen poll made headlines by reporting that 41% of Americans blame global warming on human activity, down from 46% two years ago.      However, in the 2006 poll, 56% of Democrats said human activity was the cause of global warming while 51% of Republicans said it was largely natural.      In the 2008 poll found that 59% of Democrats blame global warming on human activity as opposed to just 21% of Republicans.  67% of Republicans blamed natural causes as opposed to 23% of Democrats.    http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/03/ra...       In short, since 2 years ago, slightly more Democrats have come to believe that humans are causing global warming, whereas significantly more Republicans think it's just natural.      The Democrats are in agreement with 97% of scientists who are actively researching climate science.    http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Dor...       Why is it that more and more Republicans think global warming is just natural when the scientific experts clearly think and demonstrate otherwise with peer-reviewed scientific studies?
