0E8SPyyXaa	Thats what happens to me im trying to figure it out|`|QTd8MVDjaa	You might be a little nervous to land on cement. Just totally commit to it and really focus on getting that back foot on. Maybe your body is trying to face forward instead of sideways. Shift your shoulders more so your body will stay sideways, then your feet might follow and stay parallel to the board. Maybe try to to flick more up than to the side. I don't know exactly what would cause this, because it's different for everybody. Just keep practicing and commit to it. I hope these tips helped!

I've met a couple of the fine folks from the hockey section and am pleased to say that I have pics of ALL of them that would make fine blackmail material someday. Mwahahaha.

iPWKzzQtaa	There are 2 questions there.    The heel...good news you finished your last long run. For a bruised heel besides icing, which is obvious, I'm guessing a few days rest only. Just 2 weeks to the race. Swimming as a cross training or water running would be ok.    Now the hills? Did you train hills or not? If not it's late..but here's a short workout.    On a treadmill, go to 5% gradient....go 20 mins like this, slow 6-7 min/kms...if you got in 3 runs like that...you will feel amazing running on flat ground. Don't lessen the gradient for 20 mins...slow the speed if necessary.

8m9HXnPfaa	Montreal Canadiens...    Because of the players, the history, the championships, the ups and downs, the passion of Quebecers for hockey (and all of Canada`s for that matter). Also, I live in Montreal and have grown up watching the habs play, gone to the Bell Center / Molson Center and the Famous Montreal Forum. I love my Habs.    Maurice Richard  Guy Lafleur  Jean Beliveau  Yvan Cournoyer  Bob Gainey  Steve Shutt  Guy Carbonneau  Larry Robinson  Ken Dryden  Patrick Roy  Jacques Plante  Georges Vezina  Alex Kovalev  Guy Lapointe  Serge Savard  Henri Richard  Howie Morenz  etc... (and the list goes on)    24 Stanley Cups...    Its the greatest hockey team to have ever played in the NHL.    Have a nice day|`|YTwnVAtdaa	i am a HUGE New Jersey Devils fan!!    I grew up watching them and going to games.  When i was about 7 my dad started taking me to see them and i have always loved them!!  They fight for the cup every year and they know how to win! Plus i love Brodeur and i think he is the best goalie in the NHL! Even though he is hurt right now i still like Clemmenson.|`|hX089rlnaa	Red Wings - I like their style of play, their class and skill.    I tend to prefer the European style of Hockey.|`|ARuJLITUaa	The Rangers!!    because I'm a masochist, I think.  I can't think of another reason of late.|`|KyCJOR2paa	Detroit Red Wings.  Because I live in Michigan and that's what Michiganders do.  It also makes it easier because the Wings are always a great team.    I think people should stay loyal to their local teams, except if that means rooting for the Detroit Lions.  JK, but not really.  Its a good thing I hate the NFL.  Picking teams just because they are good is kind of lame.  Because what happens when they start to suck, then you are left with a sucky team with no real reason to root for them.  That is how bandwagoners are made.  I used to work with a guy in the late '90s who rooted for the Yankees, Cowboys, Lakers, Duke (basketball).  Now that is just stupid.|`|iHjt2nWyaa	I'm not a big fan, but the Rangers!   Ps: GO GOMEZ :P !|`|XI2iylR4aa	The Islanders, because I live on the Island!  This year they haven't really given me much of a reason to like them, but I still do.|`|0r7qmf0gaa	Quebec Nordiques.|`|NIPH3Gy7aa	I have a few different teams I like.   1.

Watched some games one season and ended up picking the Sabres - late 80's /early 90's?? back when they had Malarchuk in net.|`|jLPjuVMGaa	Pitts,Nucks,Aves,Buffs,MON,ML,NJ,Det cause you are a awsome person.

They keep my hands super warm, very flexible, and very stylish;) The only thing that im not vewry fond about is the tips of the gloves arent very strong. i mean they keep my fingers warm and all, but if you rub up against the snow with them(mostly impact after jumps) but otherwise, get them. hope this helps

Without the penalty, as soon as one player left the bench, everyone else followed. Same for third man in. The league is really feeling heat over fighting and they can't afford to take chances on it getting out of control. No question, hockey is better for both of these penalties.|`|2iuZdBXraa	Rule 70.2 says, in part, that "a player who has entered the game on a legal line change ... who starts an altercation may be subject to discipline.  Simple as that.  Grayhambone - big deal, Kennedy should've stayed on the bench after that poor performance.  Schenn can deliver hits while players are on their skates, look what he did Malkin.  Nice game Schenn.|`|8m9HXnPfaa	I think a 2 minute minor penalty for fight instigation along with the 5 minute minor for roughing would have been enough.

And all you sore loser need to shut up about the refs giving the game.  Adrian Wilson  bull dozing the holder was a bad call right.  NO every penalty was shown at least 3 times by Al Michaels and every one except for 2 the whole game where legit.  The Cardinals played like they were not used to winning a game the whole game except for 1 quarter.  Thats not going to win you a Super Bowl.  Shut up and stop crying; the Steelers won the game without the refs help.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Yes, I agree with Michael K, the refs didn't give the Steelers the game. Both teams made stupid mistakes and they were penalized for them. I don't know I don't think a ref made a block on Harrison's TD run. I don't think they blocked for Ben during the final drive. I don't remember them making big throw after big throw to Holmes. I don't think they blocked anyone on Santonio Holmes forty yard play to the Cards six yard line. Holmes caught the TD pass not the refs (yes he had both feet clearly down so don't go there) We won the SB without a good offensive line and no running game. When is someone going to step up and say the Ben Roethlisberger is an elite QB.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	maybe we can trade them for some moose knuckle|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Um... no.

e481517ca5c550c982f3830cd6a6c40faa	There are no shortcuts or tricks.  If you are just beginning to train for the upcoming season, being sore and feeling slow are normal.  Also, your friends may have more experience or you may be a different point in your development.  Here is what I would do in your situation:    1. Be sure to do a good warm up with stretching and also a good warm down (easy jogging).    2. During the off season, do some jogging and some stride outs (sprints at about 70% of your max effort).  Also, there are some from drills you can do that will help you be more efficient when running/sprinting.  Here's a link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcH97Dx8V...    3. Don't neglect your weight training (upper and lower body).  Explosive speed is key to being successful in the shot and discus.|`|WrDGhduxaa	there are no tricks to running. A coach does not expect a thrower to keep up with any runners. What he wants is for you to be able to be as fast as is possible for you.  Quickness or speed is necessary to throw far.  Strength is not the only thing you need to throw well.  Try to relax and stand up tall.  Run to your best and hopefully you will improve  your speed and that will improve your throws.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Yes as a discuss/shotputer...the coach probably isn't expecting too much.    But go out slowly, even in the sprints...of course try to finish strong. Maybe you are expending too much energy at the start, putting yourself into oxygen debt.....of course that will hurt. Slow down a little and see what happens. I think it's ok not to keep up always, because every athlete is different.|`|6fl7RrJMaa	i run track, im a runner though. I just say forget about it. Doesnt matter if u keep up, just as long as ur trying ur best. Also,Just ask ur coach if u can skip a few runs, why not atleast try. I have nothing to help about the pain except ice them
YajYjjxLaa	depends, how old are you? what level hockey do you play at? well, i like it and i have it. light weight and believe it or not my slapshot got better with it. my points almost doubled too. but it is fragile, when someone slashes me i look down every time to make sure they didn't break my stick lol. btw, hockeymonkey is a good site|`|3nnjNUOjaa	It sucks i broke 6 of them this year.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	never get a junior stick........pointless unless your 60 pounds. There just pasta noodles.    There a good stick and the O cut outs are to make the stick less likely to break not give you a harder shot.    For 100 bucks its a good stick, for $354 when they first came out no way.    I found the blades a little small for my liking but really no big deal they are still designed to really torque out a great shot.    don't buy it online, there 100 bucks every where nowadays.    another problem, sticks that are red yellow or green (green being the least offencive) are easy for refs to pick up penalties on as they really stand out.    excellent stick for the money but the bauer one 90's are $125 bucks too now and there a really good stick..again no juniors.    good luck!!!|`|x9GODf8eaa	I have never used it, but based on customer reviews, I would not recommend it.    The stick is designed to be like a bauer supreme stick, built for powerful slapshots. However, it is heavier, breaks easier (I have heard from reviews) and not as widely used as many other top of the line sticks (one95, vapor xxxx, se16, s17, 7k, etc).    If that is the kind of stick you want (power) I would recommend you get either the supreme one95 or the stealth s17.|`|ZNFjSlKvaa	All of the older kids using Senior Sticks 9K O-Sticks said they broke easily but were light weight. If its only a Junior stick then I think you would be good. The stick is really light, and for a junior makes a nice stick.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	dont get it, its not that great. if you really want a quality stick, get the 7k sickick.

WpqwaqcQaa	well money is a huge part of it but you also need a good driver and design team. Certainly Honda and Toyota have plenty of money but that hasn't helped them win.    these days the shortest route to Formula one is to come up thru a minor series like in Europe (British Formula 3) or North America (Indy Lights).    It's like racing an upside down F-15 fighter jet.    the G's or g forces the drivers pull on every turn are incredible.    when Nascar driver Jeff Gordon took a spin in Montoya's F1 car (few years ago) Gordon  said the braking was so much better and that his neck was hurting just from those few laps. Montoya said something like driving a Gordon's car was like driving a brick on ice.    so to become a F1 driver you would need a ton of money and a great deal of talent.    also re-post you question under    "sports / auto racing / Formula One".    and you'll get more informed answers|`|3bbBBMNnaa	you need lots of money from sponsors aswell as having skill   the top teams hav more money to spend on their cars so have an advantage over the smaller teams with less money|`|GOHWnkWPaa	its something that takes people around the track in an automobile
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure that sounds pretty interesting.Maybe you should be writing the storylines in WWE !|`|k2fFfNtRaa	It used to be good in the ealy 90's but has gone down hill. Tna and roh is alot better in my opinion.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I understand in a way your feelings towards WWE. However, WWE and TNA are not the only promotions out there. Maybe you should look into RoH or Dragon Gate. Less storylines and more technical wrestling.|`|rJMZdp04aa	First Off , I Thank You & Commend you for Acknowledging it as Scripted , and not Fake.  At least you still have some Respect for it , even if you don't like it anymore.    And I get where you're coming from , I understand.  But as a HUGE Pro WRESTLING Fan (I am not a WWE Mark) and someone who is Training to become a Pro - I must disagree with you on some things , but Not All.    1 - Is it still Worth it? / And is it still Entertaining?  Yes. To Me it is.  It serves it's Purpose as 2 hours of Entertainment on Mondays & Fridays. Great way to Start & End the Week.  That is it's Job , as with all Entertainment - To let People Escape Reality for a Few Hours & let them Believe in Something Better.  Give them something to talk about.    And Yes , I'll still buy maybe 8/14 WWE PPV's (I watch all TNA & Worse WWE PPV's online) that are good.  Anything that has the Elimination Chamber , Hell in a Cell , Last Man Standing , etc.. - I'll admit , I'm a Dead Mark for.    These Performers are THE Best Athletes in the World.  I don't care what anyone says , and I will Defend that.  They Deserve the Respect to at least watch some of the PPV's.      2 - Is it getting to the "Beyond Cheesy" Point? / Storylines worth Watching?    In some Aspects - Yes.  ECW is THE Prime Example.  ECW has become the Epitome of the Kiddie Era.  Make Believe Characters , Leprechauns , & No Sexy Women.  WWECW is a Disgrace to the OG ECW.  Personally , And I believe Most Fans would agree - I REALLY wouldn't care if ECW just got Completely Buried & was put out of it's Misery for Good Once and for All.  All it is anymore is the Development Territory FCW on National TV.  It Means Nothing.    On the Other Hand though , there ARE some pretty good Storylines FINALLY making their way back into WWE.  At the Moment , I see 3 happening at the same time:  -Randy Orton/Mcmahon's - The Punting of Vince  -HBK/JBL - HBK is Broke  -Jeff Hardy/Matt Hardy - Matt is Jealous of Little Bro. , Possible Christian Return    It Does make for Some Interesting Television on Monday & Friday Nights.  It's Better than Most other "Entertainment" out there , and I'll admit , with the PG Era - It is Really for the Whole Family.    WWE appeals to Everyone - No matter Age , Gender , Race , or Background.  It Truly is the Entertainment Melting Pot.  It has something for Everyone.    You make Good Points , & I Respect your Opinions.  And Again , I thank you for the Mutal Respect returned to us who are still Wrestling Fans.|`|Y3O8cW8Kaa	Wait!!! You said you haven't watched WWE in a good "year" so how in the world are you critiquing the story lines and the company? I could understand if you've been watching regularly, but you haven't watched in a FULL YEAR so how do you know what is going on? So John Cena being number 1 and Kurt Angle going to TNA justifies that you are knowledgeable? You have not been watching WWE so please go and watch for a year and then come back and post on how you don't like it. I still don't understand....you have NOT BEEN WATCHING yet you still critizie.People before you hear his thoughts on wrestling please be aware that he states, himself, that he has NOT watched in a a year. Oh, just to answer your question no your opinion is not good.|`|02XHxknUaa	its ok
AA12103453	I totally agree with you, and agree with the calls that were questionable for the most part. I don't really think that the personal foul for unnecessary roughness(running in to the holder) was questionable, but I'm guessing you are more talking about the calls people bring up as questionable. When I saw the Roughing the passer at game speed I thought that didn't really need called, but hey it was technically the right call. Glad to see some more people who like to watch a good game.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Because it's the same every year....people will ALWAYS complain about the Super Bowl regardless who wins.    It's the nature of the beast.|`|KNTofuxMaa	The holding in the end zone for the safety was obvious. Not only did one tackle hold, both held. Clerly visible in replay.     The calls, or, lack thereof were...    The 100 yard INT return. The guys knee was clearly down. Great play but, should have been 991/2 yard return for no TD    Why did they not call Santonio for using the ball as a prop. He used the ball to imitate a powder bottle then, used it to simulate throwing powder into the air. No flag.    Warner's arm was going forward. His forward motion pulled through the defender's arm and was still in his possession after clearing the defender's grasp.     Unfortunately, poor officiating is becoming the norm in sports. Steeler fans will say stop crying. They would be crying if their team was on the receiving end of the shaft.  Again, I'm a fan of neither team. Just an NFL fan who is sick of the refs deciding the outcome of the game.     Side note... Anyone else thinks it's ironic that the ref's flag are the same color as the Steelers uniforms?|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Well, complaining about officiating seems to be part of watching the game. We do need to have as accurate officiating as possible, due to the competitive and financial nature of the sport. Although I am with you on the excessive complaints that arise sometimes and are used as excuses for games that were simply lost.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	I like the question and I like Bam Bam's answer. Both correct. I am an independent, but last night I felt empathy for the underdog, although I still have tremendous respect for the Steelers.    Still, all the whining and bickering about refs from Cards fans, plus all the braggadocio from the Steeler fans only serve to cheapen the memory of an outstanding Superbowl played as hard as either team could and resulting in a squeaked, but deserved, win.|`|yw8IeiPNaa	every fan is going to talk about the game and how this should have happened or that happened.It's just part of the game.If you don't want to read about them don't read them.|`|8NLNF0sraa	Finally, someone who feels the same way I do.  I am a Steelers fan, and proud of it, but I also like the Cardinals.  I thought last nights game was great, and I do agree some of the calls could be questionable, but for the most part, the refs did call them good.  I could go on and on, but I won't..  People make me so mad when they can't accept the way a game ended.|`|fm2fCEf7aa	Its because the Superbowl went from being about football to being another place to be seen. Where were all the big ads, halftime extravaganzas, and big dollar payoffs during the early Superbowls? Nowhere. It wasn't' till someone saw they could ripoff the game and make it a business did it go from being a fun way to spend an afternoon. Screw the hype, the flash, the festival... we need to take back our dang game. Forget the million dollar salaries, high priced tickets, and $5 hot dogs... its more fun watching my nephews, sons and son-in-laws play football in the back yard... besides parking is free and I don't have to stand in line to go to the bathroom... we have 3 and I own the house.|`|uOVsCWdNaa	I wish everyone would just be happy that they got to watch an awesome game. If the Cardinals would have won their fans would not be whining right now. The best team won. Go Steelers!

UYTMABFLaa	One work out you can do is find something stable to step on, about a foot high, give or take a few inches. Put your right foot on the step, then jump as high as you can straight up using your right foot to push you up. Land back on your right foot, then back to the ground on your left. Do about 10 of these, then switch to your left foot on the step. Remember to use your arms too. This workout would be even better with small weights in your hands.    I used JumpSoles for increasing my vertical. You can just wear them around the house and don't have to work out and you will get stronger. Working out with them and following the work outs they provide, or making up your own, will definitely increase your vertical.    Squats are also another good option to get your jumping muscles in shape, as well as power cleans, if you have access to that equipment. Even just doing them without weights will help.    One tip for blocking. When you jump up to block, to get hang time, leave your arms up in the air, shrug your shoulders up, and reach as high as you can with your thumbs pointing to the ceiling and your fingers fanning out to cover maximum area. If the ball goes past your block and you need to get down quickly, drop your shoulders in the air and it will bring you down faster. Try it, it sounds silly, but it works.    As a middle, I would also practice doing your step-cross-hop footwork since you will need to get out to the sides quickly, and none of this information will help you if you can't get out there quick enough to set up for the block!    Hope this all helped! I'm sure you'll get more tips. Take them all into consideration and do what works best for you!|`|OHmpeZPyaa	You can use the Vertimax. It's a machine that you use to help your vertical get better. If there's a local gym around where you live you can ask if they have one. I've only tried it once, but you can see that it works after you finish using it. Hope this helps. :)|`|Z6SMxM6saa	Buy some leg waits and do everything you can in them, walk around the house work out. They are the best

JKbvnwcDaa	Tyree caught that ball on his dome. Holmes made a nice play, but there really is no comparison.|`|AA10106002	Holmes, 'cause it won the game.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Well, Tyree's was more amazing (Mannings escape AND the catch itself) but Holmes' was for the game winning touchdown. I think Holmes goes down as the biggest catch in SB history.    Look how much reverence is still paid to "THE CATCH" Montana to Dwight Clark in 1982 and that was only the NFC Championship game.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Tyree...........no doubt!|`|wxXguyK3aa	Tyree, just because of how Eli escaped and Tyree had to push the ball against his head.  However, the Holmes catch was a TD and with a lot less time left.|`|jpTl3o5naa	Santonio Holmes and he is the MVP! The guy didn't get to show off his skills much but without that beautiful catch for the TD, Steelers would have lost. It will go down in history as one of the most memorable. It put him right up there in the league of people like Lynn Swann. The Steelers are the Super Bowl champs and 6 times at that, so why wouldn't that be the highlight of the game? That play won the game for the Steelers. It was a very close game and a real nail biter! Wow! What a game, what a half-time show with the "Boss and the E Street band" and Jennifer Hudson from American Idol sang an outstanding version of our National Anthem. The commercials were great too. How much more could we ask for?|`|hA5m65Waaa	Tyree by far|`|IgXqUytkaa	both will go down in history as one of the greatest catches in the superbowl but i would say Tyree's is better because of eli escape.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	Tyree was most amazing.....|`|u4Hv7gdIaa	Depends on what you look at, ya know.   David tyree was a 6th round pick and really a 4th receiver which makes the catch even more amazing, but it really was just a lucky catch that he could never duplicate. tyree doesn't really have remarkable talent and skill.    holmes on the other hand was a first round pick so everyone knows he can play. His catch was pretty good b/c he had to drag his feet and it was the game winner, but he will probably do that many times throughout his career.HIs catch was more planned than Tyree's.      The way I see it Tyree's

DfPyyDssaa	For many centuries to come.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	Hopefully, it will last forever or until vince's money runs out. Shane or Stephanie, will run it after vince dies and hhh will help.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	i think it would carry onb without him.. they make so much money it could always continue.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	When Vince goes the first order of business is to get a new creative team.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	The WWWF/WWF/WWE has existed for more than 45 years. It is much bigger and has more cash resources than it ever has had in it's entire history. As long as Vince does not throw millions into other things, i.e. the World Body Building Federation, the XFL, Ico Pro, Hotels, Casinos or other activities that would cost WWE Tens of Millions or Hundreds of MIllions in losses. The company will probably continue for decades to come. When Vince and Linda do decide to no longer have active roles in World Wrestling Entertainment, Shane, Marissa, Stephanie, Jean Paul (Triple H) will have the majority of shares in World Wrestling Entertainment. Their children will have roles in the company and will run the company decades from now when Shane, Marissa, Stephanie and Jean Paul decide to step aside.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I think your question should be how is the WWE still going on. I'm sorry but it's really going down hill for the past few years.|`|FxvZmBGBaa	I hope it lasts 4eva|`|EZf00NJJaa	Hopefully , forever .    Stephanie , HHH , Shane and then the next generation of Mc Mahons ......|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	yeah|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	yes shame would|`|2NTGmTdaaa	If Shane does take it on, he will have a lot of work to do as WWE in my opinion can not go on for much longer. Even though i am a big fan of it myself, the story lines are becoming weaker and weaker as the years progress and it is always the same people winning the belts. For example, if HHH wins the belt at No Way Out, that will be his 13th major championship in WWE. Also, the wrestlers that are coming into WWE are becoming mor and more outrageous which may add comedy to the show, but puts the name down. For example, the new guy who supposedly comes from the funfair, is absolutely useless at wrestling and even some of the wrestlers that have been in there longer, for example, William Regal, cannot wrestle. In my opinion, if WWE carries on, they should think of getting rid of some of the roster and bringing in new, fresh talent that are able to wrestle.|`|081NXWAeaa	yeah    WWE will go on|`|gCG1uUafaa	I think it is Shane's and Stephanie's blood so it will continue.    With them both having children and HHH being Stephanie's kids dad they will carry it on too.    Long live wwe.

I give credit to the owners...The Rooney family....THEY are the best.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Yes, yes they are.|`|ndopqX6Taa	There was football before the Super Ball you know, so if you want to include Championships The Packers won 11 Championships before the Super Bowl started to be played.     In todays game they are the best franchise. They do not go out for the quick fix, they are loyal to their coaches and build a team instead of trying to create one. The NFL is such a copycat league, I wish some of the other teams would start copying that.     And I am definitelyy not a fan of the Steelers.
ndxXPie9aa	He should have been EJECTED!!|`|grBxTsK6aa	It looked like they were both in the wrong, but he over-reacted.|`|UQYurvnYaa	no one knows what happened except for those to. buuut it was pretty funny|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	oh that was a legal hit, nothing wrong with that at all.  Just like the other calls, that was fine. He shouldnt have been flagged for that.  Ask Steelers fans, they can tell you there was nothing wrong with it|`|dfo8gSaraa	Regardless of what happened, Harrison should've kept his composure.

Hit the guy in front of you.  That kind of stuff happens on every play in football.          If you have never played the game please don't judge that play.  I played o-line and d-line. That is common in the trenches. and being that that was on a punt makes it even more likely that stuff happens.|`|HJIyxjUuaa	he was a jerk  they should have suspended him... and mike tomlin didn't talk to him|`|hlmvLfmtaa	He was presenting himself in an honorable professional image that all the little gangsta wannabees can look up to and admire.

Harrison doesn't have a reputation of playing dirty.  We probably saw a retaliatory act.  For hockey fans, that was a love tap.  Relax all you soccer fans, this is football.  Francisco didn't even feel it in those pads.|`|XevoB1uyaa	The flag was was for standing over the player not for hitting him. Open hand, not to the face, pushing him down. You don't get a penalty for over-powering an opponent. It's legal.|`|fc6551745f589de7c5708e185ca0b59daa	That was an inexcusable act, and he should be fined and suspended for at least one game.  If you think that play was ok, then you are a biased Steelers' fan or a moron.  Even John Madden said he should be ejected, and like him or not, Madden has lived football for over 60 years, so he has experienced, seen, and knows a lot more about football than either you or I do.|`|JnKtpazfaa	i think he was mad  but it was funny

8oAlBL91aa	Really the only way to get tickets is to get them on ebay or another ticket place or from someone you know, the only reason we have gotten to 2 games (in 4 years) is because we knew someone and still had to pay face value.

sqfjfR3iaa	If you go to House Shows and Pay Per Views, you are more likely to see blood.

PLUS, IT'S NO WORSE THAN CUTTING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SHAVE ANYWAY, IT'S JUST A LITTLE NICK THEY MAKE IN THEIR FOREHEADS, NO BIGGER ACROSS THAN THE SIDE OF A DIME. THEY DO IT WHEN THEY SWEAT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS MORE BLOOD THAN THEIR ACTUALLY IS. KEEP IN MIND, WWE WAS DOING BLADEJOBS IN 1993 TOO, AND IN 1993, THEY WERE JUST AS PG, IF NOT MORESO THAN THEY ARE TODAY.

ujMsLUcNaa	Any basketball team selling ......ahem.... I meant trading Pau Gasol for a bunch of scrubs and noobies has got to be the worst run franchise, not just in the NBA but in the entire galaxy.|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	they got oj mayo, rudy gay, and marc gasol, pau's brother, so i think they're trying to win, but the problem with those three players is that they're all young and only want to score points, not play defense|`|keUqPWVuaa	He's dead on, to much talent has slipped through the fingers of that franchise. They have had players that you can build championship franchises around, but they never get them help. they think if they get A superstar then they should win. They ride that pony until it drops. Then they trade them away. That's why players are know fro leaving the franchise as soon as their contracts expire. That's not how you want your franchise to be thought of among players. You want to be thought of like San Antonio, Boston, or Golden State. These are teams that are known for how well they take care of players. Taking care of players isn't just your pay check. It's not having to play 39 minutes every night wearing your body down. Players who play massive minutes have shorter careers. A longer career means more money even if you don't have a huge contract.     Getting some young players and trying to win doesn't mean your managing your. Managing the team means surround a star with good support tallent.  Signing players based on good team chemistry not just skills. A player who struggled under one teams system could be an All-Star in another. It's all based on the chemistry of the people that surround them. This is one of the things that seems to be lost on The Grizzles management. Having promising young talent is great, but without any veteran leadership to give them direction or purpose you lose focus to easily.    Next season Memphis will be trading away some of the young talent they have now because they are going to be trying to address some shortcoming they noticed this year. So the young players that are finally building a rapport will be broken up. This is what they always do.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	that is true.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	The Grizzlies used to be in Vancouver, Canada where I live.  All the team gave us when they were here were neverending losses, terrible draft picks, bad ownership.  The worst franchise and team in NBA history, very much agree.|`|BiMkowVMaa	As long as the Los Angeles Clippers exist there is no franchise worse then the Clippers.    I've seen the Grizzles play, the problem is a truck load of young players and a poor coach. The players do try hard, but they also have a week bench. Their plan is to save money for the 2009-2010 seasons free agents. Which is no different than the Knicks, the Heat, the Suns, and many others team on the brink or lottery and playoffs.|`|moeaIZB9aa	well i dont know they got OJ mayo now so it looks like they're trying to win they're just really bad

SkN2NqpGaa	Yes, targetbutt is correct, but he did leave ouit a couple things.    Momentum. The more momentum the sharp broadhead (or perhaps even bodkin*) tipped arrow has, the more resistence it takes to stop that arrow. A fellow named Pip Bickerstaffe, using an English "Warbow" (an English Longbow, of the "Robin Hood" style, made of yew) put bodkin tipped wooden arrows through plates of modern mild steel from a distance of 20 or so yards.... In fairly broad, general terms, the heavier the arrow, the more momentum the arrow has.    The actual type of metal those "armor plates" are made of. See above, about the bodkin tipped arrows and the plates of mild steel....    And, of course, there are always gaps between those metal/ceramic armor plates in "body armor". The plate might be able to stop a knife or sharp broadhead tipped arrow -- but if the knife or arrow hits one of those gaps....    The reason kevlar can stop a bullet is because the bullet is usually designed to squash down, and become larger in diameter when it hits something. That larger diameter means more surface area hitting the "target", and because the bullet weighs very little to begin with it is easier to slow (and stop) the bullet.    The point of the broadhead (or bodkin) does not normally squash down like a bullet does, so it stays small with very little surface area at the place of impact with the armor. It isn't just the weight of the broadhead (or bodkin) which has to be stopped, either -- it is the weight of the entire arrow (and most hunting-weight arrows are far heavier than most bullets - at least twice as heavy as a 30-06 slug).    *a bodkin is not a "target" or "field" point - it is a type of point designed for piercing armor.|`|ZKikquiOaa	It's not the power, it's the point.  An arrow shot from a longbow with sharp broadhead can easily slice through modern kevlar armor.  Now if the armor is backed up by ceramic plate or steel plate then the broadhead will run into problem.  Kevlar is fabric, it'll stop bullets, but it won't stop sharp objects like knives or broadheads.|`|H7GIq2eFaa	You are correct target.  There are special vests for stab protection that would probably stop the arrow as well as the plates.
Lb811SzCaa	No excuse for not reveiwing it. It is as though they forgot it was the SuperBowl. I would not have been surprised if they reviewed that play in a preseason game for crying out loud. That said, he did not have control of the ball so according to rule book it was a fumble. According to me it was an incomplete pass (does that make sense?)|`|yw8IeiPNaa	from what I hear they did but to late to change things.|`|uDF2jNpUaa	The booth did in fact review the play but deemed it not necessary for the referee to go and review it.  Under two minutes the booth looks at any play that could be considered reviewable they will ask the ref to look at it.      In this situation the booth determined it was a clear fumble when they looked at it and felt it unnecessary for the ref to review.  You could actually here Al Michaels saying this on air after the play occurred.|`|S0PSLpZiaa	as kurt warners arm was going forward lamaar woodley pulled it back and the ball fell forward therefore fumble face cardinals fans arizona sucks GO Steelers|`|8t5vPDnqaa	I absolutely agree.  I'm not a fan of either the Cards or the Steelers, I just like to see a good game.  Yesterday was definitely a great game but marred by that last play and some penalties.  The Cards rightfully should have had one more play.  I would have like to have seen Warner chuck up a grab ball in Fitz' direction.    It was not an empty hand going forwards.  The hand had a ball in it when it was going forwards.  I was watching the game with my Steelers-fan-buddy and even he admits it should have been labeled a forward pass after we reviewed it several times on his PVR.|`|C4KFUBLDaa	Woodley's hand was on the ball well before Kurt started to pass it.  I agree with the first overturned call, the arm was already in forward motion, but on this play it was not.  Only after Kurt was loosing possession did his arm start moving forward.  Even Kurt didn't protest this call as much as the first.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	I saw the play and the replay and yes his arm was going forward but if you look closely he had lost control of the ball so case in point yes it was a fumble and i was rooting for the cards to win but overall the game was exciting yet to many foolish calls on the cards led to their demise and a call i know of that was called as a face mask against Rodgers-Cromartie was not a facemask at all and shouldn;t have been called.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Definitely bogus.  The NFL says they looked at it.  I don't buy it.  Play should have been stopped.  His arm was going forward.|`|GKUjM0vyaa	they did and it was pronounced as fumble   watch sports center they have been talking about it almost all day    plus it would have not made a difference with under 5 seconds to go   Bunch of cry babies thought they can beat "The Gods Of Football" The Steelers. LOL, LOL, LOL, LOL, LOL, LOL!!!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	that sucks too       but I did like the 10 second show|`|a6EndAPiaa	First off the last play of the game was Ben Roethlisberger taking a knee.    The second to the last play of the game could have been reviewed for 2 days and it still would not get changed.  Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.  That is the way the rule works.    I am sure the replay booth official looked at the play and immediately determined that it was a fumble and that the play did not need to be reviewed.    For those of you who think it was a forward pass I am sorry you just do not understand the rule.  Weather you agree with the rule is a different story.    Empty hand moving forward = fumble EVERY TIME.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Because in the NFL, the referees don't always use the booth review like they do in college. If they are confident with what they see then they will stick to it. With no timeouts the Cards couldn't challenge the play, this is why I prefer the college rules more. You can argue saying that the game was rigged, but don't hate the games hate the rules. I mean in the NFL, in overtime the team that scores first wins how unreasonable. That means that whichever team has more luck with the coin toss usually wins the game, bogus.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Because it was clear that it was a fumble...no need to review it.    We can thank Bill Belichick and Tommy Brady for that..."The Tuck Rule"|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I watched every play of the game intensely, and I cannot agree with you. To me that was a clear fumble with the ball being stripped by a Steeler. Remember they did give Kurt the ball back the first time, ruling that he was in the process of - and intending to - throw a pass.|`|uOVsCWdNaa	Wah wah wah. Please, your whining will not change it. There were calls against both teams blah blah blah. Bottom line: Steelers played better. Please just get over it. You should be happy the Cardinals made it into the Super Bowl.|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	Same reason why they didn`t give Pass Interference to Kevin Curtis when he got tripped up by Cards Corner. It`s all Rigged, or Officials paid off.

He should have to publicly apologize, he should be fined and suspended at least one regular season game.  That's inexcusable, regardless if the Cardinal players was holding him, you don't physically assault someone, whether on the gridiron or in the street.  And yes, punching someone in the back, while they're on the ground, and then shoving him ten feet is assault.  All that he received for that was a 5 inch penalty.|`|GKUjM0vyaa	That was a punishment punch from one of the Football Gods. LOL  " The Gods Of Football" "The Steelers"
LsH5lpnEaa	Steelers fan reigns in:  A NFL game cannot be protested.  Any sort of change or rebuttal would have to come from the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell.  Since they already gave out the trophies and speeches, I don't see it happening.  If a miracle occurred and something was officially stated it wouldn't be until after the pro bowl.    My friends and I were watching the review in slow motion in HD on a 60" TV.  We watched it about five times forward and backward.  Kurt Warners arm actually did go forward two to three inches before contact.  Upon contact his arm was pushed back near where his arm rotation started.  When his arm returned following contact the ball popped out and his arm flew forward.   They claim the call was reviewed by the booth.  An official review with the penalty would have placed the Cardinals on the 29 yard line with approximately 8 seconds left.  Still a long shot.  However, it wouldn't have soured our victory.    Both teams played great despite one case of poor sportmanship.  My hats are off to the Cardinals on a great season.|`|i5MInqeMaa	There were some legit complaints about the reffing, i agree, but i'm not a steeler fan either.  I actually wanted the CArds to win.  But the CAds made some big mistakes.  No excuses.  If Kurt warner didn't throw that int for a TD than the cards would win.  Can't make excuses if you make mistakes like that.  Why didn't they try to get Fitz involved more ith the first half.  They guy is unbelivable.  I agree the ending sucked for the CArds, but that doesn't mean there gona still go down and score a TD.|`|812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	The first hit on Warner was a fumble too, the refs were clearly on Arizona's side on that one.  He got popped in the shoulder and the mere fact that it looked as if his arm was going forward from one (1) angle, they reversed that call.  Was complete BS.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Kurts arm was not going forward so I don't know what game you were watching.    It was a great game and the better team won, period.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	seriously officials sucked in this one. the fact the cards challenged TWO calls and won shows that the refs were eager to call anything that would help the steelers. im a steelers fan also but some of that was just generic|`|wuPTBIIuaa	the one play they called at the end of the first half was a good call. i believe i saw the head touch inside the end zone first.and it really looked like both toes touched down solid.    edit:  the call by the box was a fumble. i saw the hand of the quarterback and the ball separate before the arm was extended. the ball was coming out of the hand, just after the arm-**** was farthest back, i think it was a fumble too.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Ken Wisenhut did not complain about the last play - as you are - and it was booth reviewed. Almost every play was which was unusual for a Superbowl because of the time it chews up.    Also, bad behavior is unacceptable, and should not be tolerated. However during the big game those rules are relaxed due to the pressure on the players and the teams being from different divisions and sometimes very different schools of thought.|`|AA11097612	The ball was clearly hit before Warner's arm started forward.  Warner was clearly not in control of the ball.  The ball was muffed in accordance with the NFL rules.  The play resulted in a fumble.  Steelers recovered the ball.  Steeler's ball.    Even Warner, who complained on the earlier play when he was trying to throw the ball and ultimately ruled as an incomplete pass, didn't complain at all after this play.  Why?  Because he knew the rules too and knew what had happened.  He fumbled the ball.  The Steelers recovered the ball. Steelers win.    I can understand the complaining about many of the calls and non-calls in the game but not this one.|`|HP53PqRCaa	Woulda...shoulda...coulda...blah blah blah!|`|IcOxR1p7aa	If anyone will protest, the coaches and owner will file a grievance with the NFL commissioner. However, the Steelers won and they will not file. During the off-season the owners and Players association will probably revamp the challenges and review system. We have had too many "blown games" this season.|`|fm2fCEf7aa	Since the NFL makes their own rules and hires their own officials it cannot be protested. Yet a Congressional Investigation can be conducted to see if any Anti-trust Laws were violated but that isn't about to happen. It would take someone in Congress to request the investigation and since the politicians get contributions and endorsements from these team owners that's not about to happen.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	I don't know why people keep complaining about that call, it was clear as day that he fumbled and was in no way even close.  If your gonna complain about calls at least complain about the ones that were close, like the late hit against Big Ben.|`|fW42riZfaa	This superbowl showed me that these games are fixed, the NFL wont get another penny from me.
126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	That's a tough question. This year's Super Bowl was great, edge of my seat, OMG can they really do it action! I loved it. But last year's Super Bowl was equally great. I mean the whole time I just kept expecting the Patriots to pull it out. I mean they had all year. They're gonna win, they're gonna win, but the Giants refused to lose. It was amazing, incredibly, just historic. For a team to go 18-0 and then lose the Championship game, you CANNOT beat that. Last year's Super Bowl is number 1, but this year's is number 2. (Haha...Seriously, there hasn't really been a Super Bowl as good as the last two years since either the Rams v. Titans or maybe Ravens v. Giants).     And the Cardinals were a classy team in my opinion. Classy because they played with their hearts. They played the best they could, and that was almost enough. I don't care what the mayor did (he has nothing to do with the team, your logic here is retarded), or what the fans did, or anything, the player's played with tremendous heart and respect, and they deserved to be in the Super Bowl, and if they would've won, they would've deserved it. But Pittsburgh was the better team, and they made enough plays to earn the title. Nevertheless, Congratulations to Arizona Cardinals on an extraordinary playoff run and hopefully they continue to have success. They've been doormats of their division and the entire league for long enough. Congratulations to both teams.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not me. Last night was the best Superbowl I can ever remember seeing since the seventies, albeit it was sloppy. But what can you do. The pressure is so great on the players and the emotions run so high.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Steeler fans in the House to tell that this year Super Bowl was better then last year because AZ wasn't Classy their Mayor stomped the Terrible Towel like the TN Titans did, I knew the Steelers would win because the Cards actually did not show any class.      6TH TITLE for the BLACK AND GOLD.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	this one was a good superbowl. most emotionally envolved one ive ever been apart of. so better than last year.. hands down|`|wuPTBIIuaa	so far i havent seen the whole game. but i heard the overturn at the end was pretty good.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	They were both great games.  Anytime you have the outcome of a championship game decided in the final seconds makes for great memories and the victory sweeter.  Blow outs make me yawn.|`|5xf4qlGHaa	Last year hands down.|`|3692ob2daa	why would you call them a scum?|`|QS2zFPJhaa	LAST YEAR  this year would have been better if the panthers was going against the Steelers|`|W7BZcdynaa	This years.    Last years was boring until the last two drives. Watching Punt after Punt is annoying.      Top 3    1) St. Louis over Tennessee (one yard short)  2) New England over St. Louis ( 2nd biggest upset ever, going by the spread) NYJ over Indy was  1.  3) Pittsburgh over Arizona      If I was old enough I would put the Jets one up there.|`|Lb811SzCaa	You know what. They were both amazing. I too am a huge Giants fan so I of course enjoyed last year better. Also you had the story line of the Pats trying to go undefeated etc... So it will probably go down in history as better.    However, I do think the game last night was just as tantalizing for Cards and Steelers fans as it was for us and Pats fans last year. Plus their was more scoring in the game last night. Harrison's play, The cards coming from behind. Holmes catch. I think their was more action last night in that sense. Problem was it was the Steelers and the Cards.    End result, they were both incredible and I would rate them equal.|`|lNytOKH5aa	this year cuz in the second half it was real exciting but last year wasn't dat exciting|`|qThmcR1Aaa	There has never been a better Super Bowl than last year's.    It's funny, though ... I wonder where all the people went who kept whining about what a BORING Super Bowl this one was gonna be. People have been bellyaching for two weeks about it. And now other people are coming in here asking if 43 was the "best ever." Hilarious.|`|M5ZZE7W0aa	As a native Steeler fan I would agree that last years was better because the integrity of the NFL was on the line esp with the spygate because if the Patriots won, we would see nothing but Congressional hearings involving every team spying. The Giants showed that you don't have to cheat to win it all and thus we would not be able to enjoy this years Super Bowl.     Anyway, I can't wait to go to the Steeler Parade tommorow at noon for the second time in my life.|`|WFWmU3wkaa	I agree.  Any game with Larry Fitzgerald makes it ten times better than it would've been without him
AA11108627	All of the above, except  5 of course.      There are "key" plays in every game, but who knows if even one missed block that was made could have dramatically changed the result of a seemingly meaningless play?    In an intensely team sport like football, EVERY play is important, and serves as a building-block for the victory.    Of course,  3 is a matter of opinion.  You can't look at 1 or 2 instances and conclude the entire game was subject to poor officiating.  And it is unrealistic to expect refs -- as limited, imperfect individuals -- to see every situation, call every deserved penalty, and judge things perfectly in real time without the advantage of slow-motion replay from a variety of camera angles.  They are only human, and were specifically chosen to officiate this game as those who are the very best.    The game may not have been officiated perfectly, but no game is.  Every team doesn't get a deserved call sometimes.  The most obvious ones are usually overturned.  It's a part of the game.  Let it go.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Kurt Warner throwing the interception and the whole Arizona offense for giving up on the play and letting Harrison score.    Arizona defense on the last drive the Steeler had.  They let Big Ben march down the field like joe montana out there.  Unacceptable.    Offensive Coordiantor for Arizona.  Why couldn't they make adjustments to get the ball to fitz more in the first half.|`|xbISxnmfaa	4. Those lucky lucky bastards.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	the phanton roughing the passer penalty and the HILARIOUS "running into the HOLDER" at the goal line.  In 25 years of watching the NFL,I have never, not one time ever seen that called. I actually never even knew that was a penalty.  Also, Im not sold on Harrison even being in the end zone on that run back.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Clearly  4.    If the final score had remained 17-7 or 20-7 I would've picked  2|`|f7qVtYfaaa	the interception killed arizona , how often do you see a linebacker lumber 100 yards for a pick 6 with time run out ? thye HAD to stop that and failed, take away that and you have a different game.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	definately 2.  the harrison interception.  it was at least a 10 point swing cuz it took away cards field goal or touchdown an gave 7 to the steelers.|`|7sMyItRDaa	I think somehow Matt Millen and Tiki Barber had something to do with this. Once I find out more I will get back to you.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Hands down   2.      That was at least a 10 pt spread. It went from 10-10 (assuming Zona would at least get a FG) 17-7.|`|Lb811SzCaa	Clearly the pick 6 at end of first half.     Holmes td is second, but without Harrison's pick Holmes td is meaningless. Because the pick six was either a ten point or 14 point swing depending that was the biggest play maybe in Superbowl history. It also changed momentum going in at half time from the cards to the steelers. Notice it took the Cards until halfway through the fourth quarter to get the momentum back at all.|`|GKUjM0vyaa	2 and 4 combined    Goooooo Steelers|`|yw8IeiPNaa	Number 2.In that didn't happen then the whole game would have changed.Differant plays would have been called and the steelers would felt more pressure to make a TD.|`|AA11110524	2. james harrison   without a doubt that play was huge for the Steelers. that was a 14 point swing. not only did they stop the Cards from scoring a TD and going down 14-10 at haltime but they score and go up 17-7 to HT. if they dont get that pick 6 and the Cardinals score, Cards win. they would of done a way better job managing a lead than the Steelers.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	i agree with you on the first 4 indeed. My feeling on the Rodger-Cromartie penalty for face mask was a total b/s call. The one that stood out most to me that as a penalty that should have been called was Holmes celebration in any other game thats a flag plain and simple but the ref just let it go|`|NozkYcLLaa	I'd say 2.|`|3LQ4Dm0uaa	1,2,4.    number 4 was the big one.  But number 2 can't be overlooked.  It delivered a blow to the gut that the cards weren't able to recover from until late in the 4th quarter.  But that last drive by Big Ben was so clutch.    And great half time show too.  Bruce Springsteen is such a great singer.|`|0c0a6cf5a61a9c81feddb56b8c7a6bc4aa	2 without a doubt. Instead of possibly getting 3 or 7 points the cardinals give the steelers 7.|`|EMPzJc8Caa	the penalties against arizona. how many did the cardinals have? who  will win the big game next year?
6tGYe5roaa	I really do not think any team should be labeled "America's Team." Everyone, all across America, has their own specific team that they root for. How can you label one team as America's team over another?    I have always hated that saying. I have never thought of the Cowboys as "America's Team" and I do not look at the Steelers that way.|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Ew.    They should just leave it how it is, there is no NFL Football team to represent America.    Especially the Steelers. :P|`|5FiO6aNCaa	You people and your butt-hurtness over a silly nickname. The term America's Team belongs to the Cowboys for a reason.  During the early Super Bowl days the Cowboys were known as the team that just couldn't win the big game. It garnered a lot of support as they had the underdog sympathy vote from people. It was feel good for the nation when they began winning Super Bowls.    Calling some other team America's team is akin to calling Tampa Bay Defense the Steel Curtain. "America's Team" doesn't mean all of America loves the Cowboys, it's just a nickname that the Cowboys have.....not a title....|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Trust me, Dallas has made that nickname a running joke, Pittsburgh wouldn't want it.......|`|AA11565799	That would make everyone who supports another team annoyed.  I never bought into the Cowboys as America's team.  They are Dallas' team and certainly the more popular team in Texas. That's it.  The Cowboys are loathed in Washington, Philadelphia and New York.  Not in football but in many other sports, we get America's team every four years for the Olympics.  That's it.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	nobody should be named " americas team " because only fans in the state like them.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	na its Pittsburgh, its clear Americans an officials NEED them to be it.  Im a Cowboys fan, its clearly the Steelers.  The Steelers are the Barry Bonds of the NFL!  Everyone is bragging about 6 titles.  Well Bonds is the all time home run king yet people still complain an hate him, but love the Steelers?  Makes no sense.  People are onto the Steelers now though.  MILLIONS of people have watched how they have "won" their last 2 championships.  When your on the world stage an winning that way, it damages your credibility as a true champion big time.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I think it would be the Dallas Cowboys for mainstream America.    Overrated, lazy, sloppy, poor work habits, in constant legal trouble, more flash than substance. Quit easily. Easy to get in bed. No effort given.         I think the values that this country were built on are the qualities of the Pittsburgh Steelers.     Honesty. Hard work. Teamwork. Decency. Accountability. Friendship. Values. Substance. Iron on Iron.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I believe that this is nothing more than talk, since all of our teams are American and there would be an uproar over any one team being called that. However, if that were to happen, the title would have to be passed around to each team for a certain period of time for fairness.|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Redskins|`|TuOp3hNPaa	oh brother. there should be no americas team.  jus leave things as they are|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I am a Steeler fan but I don't think any team should be known as "America's Team".|`|GKUjM0vyaa	in that case president Obama likes the Steelers

z7JsVzcnaa	Lots of people start lacrosse in high school.  Starting at 13 would give your a head start on those folks.    Get your hands on a stick and get practicing catching and throwing.  It's fundamental to the game, and the sooner you can catch and throw the sooner you'll start figuring you the game.    Also, work on cradling    Can't tell you much more than that since I play and coach the men's game, but catching, passing and cradling is all the same.|`|OdD5IXI5aa	Anyone can learn to play lacrosse and many people start playing lacrosse at a later age then you.  So yes, you can start at 13.  Lacrosse is the fastest game on two feet.  It is a mix of basketball, hockey, and soccer.  The object of the game is to get the ball, which is made out of rubber and about the size of a baseball, into the opposing teams goal.  to get the ball into the goal, you use a stick that has a little net in it and you swing the stick to pass or shoot the ball.  There are four different positions, attack, midfielder, defense, and the goalie.  There is one goalie and 3 attack men, midfielders, and defense men on the field at the same time.  The midfielders can go anywhere on the field while the attack men has to stay in the offensive side and the defense and goalie have to stay on the defensive side.
utTFiz3gaa	Believe it or not Torii Hunter had a rough childhood, his dad was on drugs most of the time so his mom (and his grandma) was the main person taking care of him and his 2 other brothers. They were pretty poor and Torii and his girlfriend had a baby at the age of 16 and he really had to step up and soon after that he went to the minors and worked real hard to become a major leaguer and now he's one of the most respected and loved guys in baseball :)  Torii's great!|`|7a4kzKVeaa	well, it was Josh Hamilton....then he was traded to Texas.  i guess it would be the guy Cincy got in return: Edinson Volquez, 17 game winner last year.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	With all due respect to Joel it has to be Rick Ankiel. He had to overcome the mental meltdown he had as a pitcher, go back to the minors, and learn a completely new position.|`|FYBUbRmTaa	Carlos Quentin|`|c6q3EERdaa	I'd say Ryan Ludwick. He had gotten hurt after he made his MLB debut in 2002, and had been in the minors until re-appearing with the Cardinals in 07.

Ranked in the middle of the pack in the minors, then came in and, in his first two years mind you, won a Silver Slugger, Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove, and MVP.  Are there any awards he hasn't won yet?  His accomplishments as an undersized and underestimated player have outshone all others on the Sox, and most others in the Majors.     Now, if Lester were to, say, win a Cy Young, it might be a different story...
QtjnmEzoaa	At the beginning of the football season, you join a league (online or otherwise) and have a draft. You are given a random spot for your draft choice. You go in order for the first round, then reverse order for the second round, original order for the third round, etc. In normal rules there are 14 total rounds, because there are 14 roster spots. There are unlimited rule variations possible, but I'm going by the standard ESPN.com rules.    Once you draft your players, you set your lineup. Your starters are as follows:  QB  RB  RB  RB/WR (your choice)  WR  WR  TE  K  DST (an entire defensive squad from one team)    You will then have 5 players on your bench. The best option for your bench is a backup QB, two backup RBs, and two backup WRs. Quality replacements for the other positions can easily be picked up off the waiver line as needed.    Waivers is where undrafted players go. If you have too many players who aren't active due to their team's bye week or injury, or if you think an undrafted player will be more successful than a player you can already have, you can pick up a replacement for them on the waiver wire. You will have to drop one of your original players in order to do this.    You also have the option of trading players on your roster with other Fantasy owners throughout the season.     Before each football week begins, you must prepare your final active roster and set it at least 5 minutes before the player's game begins. You are matched up with another fantasy owners roster and your players get points based on how well they do. They get points based on Passing yards, rushing yards, receiving yards, touchdowns, and negative points for turnovers. With your defense, it's the opposite. Anyway, whichever owner whose roster accumulates the most points wins the week.    The fantasy season comprises weeks 1-13 of the NFL. Then you go into a playoff, with the  1 team, who has won the most weekly matchups, against the  4 team and the  2 team vs. the  3 team. While there are generally 10 teams in a league, only the top 4 teams make the playoffs. Each playoff matchup lasts for two weeks.    Several websites offer it (Yahoo, NFL.com, ESPN.com) though my personal favorite is ESPN. Most websites have different,customizable rules, and the ones I gave you are the ESPN rules. You'll have to wait until next season to sign up though. Usually about a week before the regular season starts is the ideal time. You have to pay to join leagues in which you can win money, but I wouldn't recommend that until you've gotten a feel for the game.    I'm trying to keep this short, so that's the condensed version for you. Add any questions you have. I promise I didn't copy and paste this from a website, it's an original answer.    Hope this helps!
yDuGraj8aa	Yeah for sure I see this all the time.  I live in delaware and im seeing cardinals fans.  there are so many front runners in this world. I work with a woman who wears a steelers jersey when they win a big game. I bet she doesnt even know 3 players on the team.  My team won 4 games this year win or lose there my team|`|btcbtyDnaa	there my 2nd fav team bud    and i still dont know why i like dallas? one more crap season and cards be my 1st|`|p6oDbJxOaa	Ha...I don't think so. People just root for them because they suck and they felt bad for them!|`|X5TNlI3Raa	sorry to tell u but i know ppl who love the nfl team arizona cardinals. duhhhh bc if az did not nfl team. than why did they build a new football stadium for no reason? the football stadium is not there for collage it is there for pro football. omg r u f****** stupid or something? the stadium is in glendale arizona.|`|7WFrijvhaa	haha i was thinking the same thing!!  they were NEVER a good team; although they were this year; i admit; BUT THEY LOST !! HAHAHAHA & the steelers WON OF COURSE :)) WOOO!|`|fHxpycJSaa	All they've done all day is whine and cry about the referees. I liked them better when they were getting their brains beaten in every year. They don't handle success very well.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	I imagine that there are a decent number of Cards' fans, but seeing as they have had little success there's not a lot to hoot and hollar about. When your team isn't doing well you basically have to keep quiet.    Not everyone is a front-runner. Some people root for the underdog. I watched the game at a Casino in Reno, NV. I was expecting a majority of Pittsburgh front-runners but surprisingly there were more people rooting for the Cards. I also saw a fair amount of Leinhert jerseys. I doubt that those were purchased this year.    I'm not exactly sure what you're bragging about. The ranks of the "Steelers' Nation" are bloated by front-runners.|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	hhahahahahhaha omg i totally agrreee!!!!!    hah    i know! i have never heard a person talk about being a cards fan until yesterday!  complete bullsh!!T|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Sure they did, they're just not as loud and obnoxious as Steeler fans.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!!|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Yes I'm sure their are some!    My Thoughts are your being a bit of a sore winner.|`|xIfvXy4waa	Haha funny, yes we do know we have a football team, a pro one, not so much. Nobody here is even from AZ so everyone was rooting for their home teams before this, and us loyal fans (LETS GO STEELERS) stuck with our teams. I really only met three families of Cardinal fans before this postseason, no joke. Thank goodness the loss shut them up.|`|0SdX6MpWaa	You know that its not only Steeler and Cardinal fans that watch the superbowl right?|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Considering the Cardinals have been around since 1898, I'm guessing they have a long and loyal fanbase. But it's human nature to pile on the bandwagon, especially when it's an underdog that hasn't won in so long. The Packers bandwagon was huge in the mid-'90s, but then everyone moved on to the Broncos. I guess they eventually became Patriots fans. It happens all the time.
2sxiHRvzaa	gary caldwell|`|217ff35a8ea8ca73e63af6072240aa24aa	Scott Brown ,or Pedro Mendez|`|bzwSCm6taa	john fleck....;-)|`|cTTmHn9paa	Chris Burke|`|m2zXOREJaa	Shinsuke Nakamura|`|lsXcvlTbaa	Broony|`|57rbgBw2aa	'cause he's an immature little idiot,...  Scott Brown nae bother.
wKGZ0h8Paa	No.  I like Miami.  Don't do that to them.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	they need to trade Andrew Bynum... he is the next Shaun Livingston.    na na na na hey hey hey goodbye Fakers! thanks Kobe!  NEVER FORGET 2008 FINALS.|`|N2177Ameaa	Naw, that trade is wack. Miami probably won't accept it. Anyways, the might trade Marion to Toronto for O'neal.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	NO.|`|A7OCbBJNaa	Pat Riley doesn't like selfish players..|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	No lol =P.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	absolutely no.|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	That would be great for the Lakers.    But they won't get the Triangle to go right. Fisher would have to take some more shots as Wade is not as clutch as Kobe. Marion wouldn't fit with the best frontcourt + best frontcourt bench in the Nation.    Heat fans would collapse. They would have to take Kobe with only Beasley and Chalmers (2 rookies) as the 2 other veterans!|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	if they get marion and wade then yes... The Lakers won't have 4 year run they will have a 10 year run with bynum and Wade... Personally if I was the Lakers GM and the Heat offered this I would hands down say yes... And a healthy Wade has the potential to be better than kobe.... Im a laker fan look at my answers not a hater...|`|tY3rZSsiaa	why would miami do this?  this makes absolutely no sense for miami.|`|IJ7vle8Vaa	naaaaaaaah|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	If that trade happened, I'd love the Lakers and hate the Heat.    For Miami's sake, that trade should not happen.  For LA's sake, that trade can't happen soon enough.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Nah, you're messing up the chemistry...|`|tBuzrlSdaa	HELL NO|`|uoIV59V6aa	lol u on crack|`|pdbUroC1aa	ummm that could be a trade becuz d-wade is a force when he's healthy currently leading the league in scoring. maybe if they gave them beasley but I still wouldn't do this trade. kobe can take over the game any time he wants so nooo way|`|SBwxjXI3aa	I wud if i got lyk 2 first and second round draft picks|`|2dgVkcVAaa	they won't|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	what the heck?  no way in hell.|`|rZmiyAqJaa	I'D LIKE TO PLAY MOTORBOAT ON YOUR KNOCKERS.|`|8IZZ4yENaa	Miami would never do it. Lakers would get the best out of the trade because they are getting two superstars to miami's one. Dwyane Wade for Kobe Bryant is more believable. Only i don' think the Lakers would let go of Kobe, he is too much of an asset.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Ha.    You're so funny.    /Sarcasm.
dfo8gSaraa	I don't. Neither does the head of NFL officials.    Only the bandwagon Cardinals fans and Steeler haters will agree with you.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	it looked like it but the call was kinda quick on the field , it is a tough one to call so who knows they didn't seem to give it much review time.game over.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	Yes.    He had control of the ball as his arm was moving forward. Yes, the ball was tipped a little bit, but he still had possession.|`|MaizmvvMaa	Nope    NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira confirmed that Kurt Warner fumbled on the Cardinals' last play of the Super Bowl.  Announcer Al Michaels claimed there was a quick booth review at the end and Pereira confirmed that as well. Neither Warner nor head coach Ken Whisenhunt believed there was a review and both were quite miffed about it after the game. The odds of a Hail Mary touchdown were incredibility slim, but Pereira's confirmation about the review and the fumble at least offer some closure to an epic game.|`|f2uqEIksaa	it was a tough call, but i think they made the right one. however, they should have reviewed it. (but even if it was incomplete, i dont think it would have made a difference)|`|Jp2415Whaa	His arm was about to throw a bomb.  he was gonna throw a hail mary just because he knew he was gonna get hit.  He did what was needed for it to be incomplete, but hey - WELCOME TO A STEELERS SUPERBOWL.  The kid here, with the steeler helmet in his avatar.  You're freaking annoying man, go enjoy your title, let others talk about controversies, because you're just gonna bring that Steeler bs in here again, K? peace.|`|nti4j9k2aa	As much as I'd like to agree with you, i think it was not incomplete. I watched it again and again trying to make it show me what I wanted to see, but it's just not there. Sorry!|`|qT73NYDzaa	Yes...when they said his arm was not going forward I was thinking , are you BLIND!|`|8t5vPDnqaa	I agree.  He was holding the ball, his arm was moving forward, ball comes out.  How is that debatable?  And I'm not a Cards fan nor a Steeler hater.  I just want to see a good football game and not feel gypped (sp?) at the ending of the Championship game.  It may not have made any difference, but I would think most football fans would want to see it played out properly.  That whole incident just reminds me of somebody who gets undercharged for an item at a store and then takes off as quickly as possible to avoid any closer examination.|`|jrRpaQEeaa	yes, i agree.
Ar5VHDiBaa	I was born into a Cubs family & I get geeked up for every season because THIS is finally going to be the year.    Jack Brickhouse said any team can have a bad century....... well that century is OVER. Cubs win it all in 2009.    Eamus Catuli|`|I2I843Myaa	If they live in Chicago that would be a reason. Also, some people started liking the organization when Sosa was there and never stopped liking it. I think they're a likable team.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Cuz there a good team and have nice fans. I feel bad for people being so harsh to them|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Why do people like the Yankees?  Why do people like the Mets?  Why do people like the Phillies?  It's the same concept, really.  Most Cubs fans probably either grew up near Chicago or their family influenced them or that was simply the first team they ever really watched play baseball.    (Most) baseball fans aren't bandwagon fans.  Your favorite team is ALWAYS your favorite team.|`|Gb6Hm4xQaa	Because people who live in Chicago prefer the Cubs over the White Sox. Why? I don't know.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	we have one of the oldest franchises in baseball, and the 2nd oldest still standing ball park, there is history, and there is a certain atmosphere and attitude that comes with being a Cubs fan, life doesn't get much better than this|`|2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	Cause they're lovable losers.|`|0vUPUoIBaa	They are true fans not winner pickers, we know that for sure|`|SA1HuYOHaa	Idk, cubs play to disappoint|`|f4Q3PeE0aa	I was born and raised on the north side of the Chi and was brought u going to cubs games. You know your a true fan if you are a cubs fan, cuz it hurts sooo bad! And with my luck after waiting for so long the minute I switch squads they will win it all!|`|RW7qVMk5aa	Because our team Tries and they might lose games, but when they do they dont hang theyr head's like pansies|`|d8e728311057920726dbfbc7353ca59faa	Why do you like the team you like?    Stupid question|`|Qs02A0Rqaa	Because they're one of the best teams in baseball... Cubs fans never stop believing. We all know our championship is coming soon, its just that nobody wants to admit it...  And nobody likes the White Sox...    GO CUBS!!!
AA12305061	They are given to Red Cross and other companies and sent to 3rd World countries, like kenya ect. They cannot legally be sold in the USA, so most of them are sent to Africa.|`|4kzXmvcdaa	they give them to people who need clothes like in Africa
l1pewZpaaa	Yeah congrats to the Cardinals.       But honestly, you didn't shock me    Oh and just a thought i'm going to put out there, good teams should be able to overcome bad penalties. Other teams do it all the time.    Oh and should they have even been in The Super Bowl? When some teams went 11-5 and didn't even make the playoffs? I mean seriously, there is division is the worst in football, so they get 6 free games right off the bat. I mean yeah they won games when they needed to in the playoffs, and congrats to them. But to say they are the best team in the NFC is a gross overstatement    Edit- Don't ask for my opinion if you don't actually want it|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Get over it.|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	sorry hun, but no. of course im a steelers fan!!    BEST team in the league!|`|6c132bf947edacc1c9a9882b9e133b43aa	well, i aint a fan of steeler or cardinals but i wanted the cardinals to win and i was mad but ya, it cheers me up that the steelers almost lost to the cardinals.|`|QdCUbFXraa	the Cardinals r awesome!|`|4IYKRhxIaa	OH YEAH YOU ROCK!!! btw- THAT WAS SO NOT A FUMBLE!!! did you see the play by fitzgerald when there was 3 minutes and 47 seconds left?! it was crazy! i was screaming when he caught it and dodged all the steelers guys and ESPECIALLY when he made a TOUCHDOWN!!! it was so cool and...    WE SHOULD HAVE WON!!!    please excuse all the capitals. im just ticked and excited and other mixed feelings.|`|OMnNgbMlaa	CARDINALS OWN IT|`|btcbtyDnaa	haha i just did the same thing    they never quit, im glad, that was a damn good super bowl, no matter who you wanted to win, im proud that that was the super bowl and represinting the NFL|`|sfl63QxAaa	Steeler fans can hardly call that a legit win because of how horrible some of the calls were.  Kurt Warner ftw|`|wbIEau0qaa	cards fan should be proud of their team !!     steeler nation.. give credit where credit is due|`|EEkg0JVSaa	I like the cardinals but I'm more of a dallas fan.|`|c5FSGxxqaa	All you diehard Cardinal fans have been so for about 4 WEEKS. Steeler fans eat, sleep, and live for football and the right team one last night.|`|yDuGraj8aa	There was a bad call and a few calls missed.  I bet you are very proud of your team. IMO they didnt deserve to play in the game. sorry but they went 9-7 regular season. They only beat 1 winning team in the regular season. Now they get to deal with the glory of the superbowl curse. You lose a superbowl next year you will be doomed for a not so good year|`|YC9vnWCvaa	i love the cardinals i thought they were gonna win  UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE it sucked and im sad =[|`|BH05gFobaa	i love you april|`|sw2C2gMwaa	I'm so sad the Cardinals lost! I wish they would have won! It was so close! They had the game!....NOT    CARDINALS SUCK|`|I59qE0WNaa	so true! that was the cardinals game ...      theyre the winners!
RW7qVMk5aa	Bonds, 15.5  Jeter, 21.6  Giambi, 23.4  Manny, 17  A-Rod, 27.7  Selig 18mil    Your numbers are wrong    Bonds easily earned his paycheck with how much he helped san fran earn with his home run chase, Jeter is overpaid, way overpaid, always has been. Giambi no way in hell he did, he had an off year. Manny Always earned his money in boston except for 2008. A-Rod he was a prue beast 2007 he earned every penny and more. BUd Selig, any time you can organize an entire baseball schedule and find places for snowed out games(yes there were snowed out games in 2007, and 2008 i think also) you deserve a ton of money, but maybe not that much      I was referring mor to the rescheduling of games which yes he was in charge of, like when he forced the astro's to play a 'home game' in milwaukee against the cubs    Either way, the salary numbers are still wrong so i really think i should be getting this best answer seing as how my answers are right :P|`|w2HNZJHBaa	A) 2  B) 3  C) 5  D) 4  E) 1  F) 6|`|u1T5TQP7aa	1) F  2) E  3) B  4) D  5) C  6) A|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	The fact the Bud Selig made at least 15.5 million is pretty distrubing.    edit: I can tell you that Bud Selig has nothing to do with creating the schedule and rescheduling make up games.  One of his senior vice presidents is in charge of scheduling.  They usually hire peope to do it for them.  http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=...
FFE9Qztzaa	Yeah. Most def.    2-1|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	SI SE PUEDE!!    VIVA MEXICO!|`|JiKNOtvdaa	I think yes, they can beat USA, mostly with the defense  They probably have like the top 4 defenses of Mexico playing against USA, but the most important part is that they all play with heart.|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	Can we? Yep  Will we?...|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Pues ojala y si|`|kPbou3Vdaa	MEXICO!!!!!|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	Probably yes. Mexico has almost 9 years without beating U.S in U.S territory. I am not happy with the way they have played so far, as they just lost to Sweden, but they have to fight to dead in order to win the game. They have good players, but the most important thing is if they can produce or not. Lets see this time.|`|XSBNv0iOaa	Its a good Call up and all.  And I know with these players we have a Great chance of wining against the U.S.A.  We just have to wait and see how Sven uses these players on the pitch,and make them seem and play like the real Seleccion Mexicana We know thats in them.|`|D3RDQDHMaa	si se puede!!!!!!!!!!|`|mdEqS1JXaa	yes i think mexico is going to play great     score 3-1|`|UbvfR4xdaa	4-0 gana usa. Why cuz mexico has sucky players and not expirience|`|DGkHpOFBaa	YES!!!  Mexico has never done well on the road....and the climate in Columbus will be cold.  Mexico better bring their heart and soul and leave in on the pitch...I want to see sweat, dust and tears....this quote says it all:    "It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."    YES MEXICO CAN AND WILL WIN!!!!|`|GDL00jbIaa	yes   score  2-1 mexico wins|`|Q6y9ua4naa	with this line up the only things holding mexcio from winning are time to get to know each other/play well together as a team and they must be able to beat the states at there own style of play, mexico cant go in pushing and attacking leaving an opening for the states to do a counterattack....they should bunker down and make the states come at them and mexico should counter attack with speed they have.  if they counter attack, get a goal and bunker they should win this game.
54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	many times    there was a 108 yard TD return about a year ago    there are probably 5 events of this type per year in the regular season    Tony Dorsett had a 99 yard run from scrimmage in a game against the Vikings once.|`|AA12103453	I think like 108 is the record. Yeah INTs have been run back from the end of the endzone, as have kick returns(and a missed field goal on a windy day). It's something to watch.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes...plenty of times...|`|MaizmvvMaa	You can't have an offensive play of 100 yards, only 99 yards, there have been i believe 9, 99 yards pass plays in NFL history, and i believe 1 it could be more 99 yard runs. the longest play in NFL history is 108 yards by antonio cromartie of the san diego chargers, which happened last year against the vikings. The 2nd longest play in superbowl history was a 98 yard kickoff return for TD.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	The longest play in NFL history was a missed field goal returned 109 yards for a touchdown by Antonio Cromartie in 2007.  (Chargers vs. Vikings)    The longest interception return for a touchdown (which is what happened last night) went for 108 yards by Ed Reed about 2 months ago.    Just to clarify, the offense can't run a play longer than 99 yards. Only special teams and defense can make plays like that.     Plays of 100 yards or more are not as uncommon as you might think. They probably happen 2-3 times per season I would assume.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ya theres lots of players tht return kicks an interceptions for more than a hundred yards. happens at least 2 or 3 times a yr|`|3nWLLWPpaa	theres been INTs for tds of over 90 yards and kick returns for 99 but the 100 yard return was the longeset ever|`|yDuGraj8aa	It happens alot all the time just this was the biggest in a superbowl.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	HOW THE HELL DO YOU LET A LINEBACKER GO 100 YDS. FOR A TD.SOMEBODY TACKLE THE GUY!!!|`|uFk8ohenaa	its possible..its happened and it was the first time 2 happe in a Super Bowl.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	This has happened many times in the last few years alone. Ed Reed has BOTH of the two longest interception returns in NFL history, 108 yards last year, and 106 yards back in '04.    Most of the longest plays were missed field goal returns though, with Cromartie's 109 yard return in 2007 standing as the longest play ever in the NFL.    Second place (108 yards) is a 4-way tie between Ed Reed, Ellis Hobbs, Nathan Vasher and Devin Hester, and all 4 of those happened in the last 3 years.|`|AA10939368	This was a record setting play that resulted in a 100 yard return.  Actually the longest run by a running back was made by Willie Parker in Superbowl XL for 75 yards.      We are specifying in the superbowl only here as this has occurred in the regular season.  An offensive player cannot run a ball back for 100 yards, only a special teams player or defensive player can do that.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Pronger has stated he is willing to leave if Anaheim gets the right deal (since when did a player get to approve a trade based on who he was traded for)    Bouwmeester and his agent halted talks with Florida a while ago and he wants to play for a perennial contendor and he doesn't feel that Florida will do the right thing even if they make the playoffs this year.    There's also the possibility that a current Chicago goaltender may be traded.|`|liUG1m9Waa	Theres always a chance Vinny Lecavilier will be traded to Montreal.    I as a Devils fan am also hoping they make a move for a Defenseman|`|hnMp0sunaa	I have a feeling we should watch for the Senators to make a big one with Spezza and Vermette. Also wondering if Gigure will stay very long in Anaheim considering what has happened. At this point, Lecavalier in Montreal would be a real shocker ...really not sure what Gainey is thinking anymore...|`|x5lqWRT3aa	Technically anyone who's a UFA this season that's on a team not competing for a playoff spot.  Definately the Islanders are trading away Guerin, Weight, and other players.  Lecavalier, I don't know about this one, it's a do or die for Tampa. Cause if they don't deal him now, they're locked to his contract, for another 11 years.  Pronger, could be going to NYR in return for maybe Gomez? Since Anaheim needs scoring help.   Briere's name is being thrown around. But it's all a pile of dust.  Kaberle 80% of being dealt (it was a higher %, but since the hand injury), if he isn't dealt this year, then next year's more likely.  Gaborik, very low % of being dealt, with his injuries and all. I think he'll leave Minnesota a UFA, or maybe being dealt for a late 1st rounder at the draft. (Trading his rights)  Eklund was saying Gionta to Vancouver (e3), that's a possibility. But I don't trust him..  Kovalchuk, not sure about his place. He's probably staying put. Most teams don't have enought cap space to support his salary.  Jay Bouwmeester is a questionable one. New York? Montreal?|`|F934e4HQaa	kovalchuk|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Phom.....Christ, please do not quote Eklund. That guy is an idiot.     Half the guys you/he mention/s have no trade clauses.|`|rvE7gyuUaa	I think the Ducks are going to shed some players.  Look for Pronger to be on his way out. I don't think Vinny is going to move and I would say 50/50 on Jay Bo.|`|NHxepPUQaa	Guys like Kaberle, Bowmeester (sp?), and Pronger could be traded. Vinny Lecavalier could possibly moved and the devils might trade Gionta.|`|zMSdChKgaa	I don't think there will be too many notable trades. All the teams in playoff contention are set. Just a prediction, I think Lecavier will be traded to the Stars.
5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	i think he looks good.    just don't understand why he's gotta pull his shorts out his bum before every point.    must be some superstition|`|xasAaGFaaa	the 3/4 capris and the sleeveless shirts always looked pimp. but he is turning that around while he is the number one player. he is wearing normal sized shorts and a t shirt. why would he need a better look. that apparel is really nice looking anyways. as the best player he can wear whatever he wants and still dominate|`|Wg3UySpfaa	i actually think he did that this year at the aus pen. Previous years i didn't like his 3/4 pants and i actually thought those shorts were the reason he kept picking at his pants, but obviously he still does it with the newly improved shorts, so i guess not. I love his shirt and shorts this year at the aus open and as long as he doesn't go back to his previous outfits...he's improved|`|poOjs31caa	zc|`|oTtRLkjEaa	i think it looks fine|`|IYxceupsaa	I didn't like the new outfit at the beginning. Since the tops were sleeved! But I quite like the outfit now. The top and shorts are not baggy like the other guys. They have a more fitted appearance which is nice. Most importantly to me he still looks really hot on court. I dunno how he does it!. There has never been such a hot tennis player like Senor Nadal. I love him!|`|degfdvTGaa	I hated his outfit at first but now i've realised he hasn't lost his powers ( the new one may actually be helping his game) i've come to like the new look|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I hate that sludgy green he wears but if he's picking his **** and wiping his arms and face every 2 seconds then he's going to annoy me whatever he wears|`|m7tjMSDCaa	well he wore green...green is my favourite colour...but i cant really imagine him wearing anything else...not much variety unlike women tennis gear|`|ZEaM2y05aa	I think Nadal can wear what ever he likes.

4V6V9uN8aa	The Undertaker, by miles..  He is widely respected throughout the WWE locker rooms & in the corporate office for a number of reasons & he is the one the rookies & younger guys learn the ropes from.  Also, aside from HBK, he has the longest tenure in the WWE & has the one mark on his record that no one else can claim, he is the only wrestler to cleanly defeat Hulk Hogan for the WWF title & not lose a match to him in return.  The only other that held that distinction was Ultimate Warrior until the NWO storyline in WCW when Hogan defeated him at Starrcade.      As for the WQ, it is easily Dave Batista.  Aside from his wrestling character, I am talking about the man himself.  Many have said he is lazy, is undeservedly pushed ahead of others who have earned their way into title contention, he is not as "strong" as WWE makes him seem, & many smaller fans (kids) are intimidated or scared of him because of the way he acts at promotional shows.  Then, there was the Ric Flair situation involving HBK.  Flair was the one to pick Michaels for that WM match.  He originally wanted one last shot at the WWE title, but it was too much to put him in title contention just for him to lose.  Everyone else backstage accepted what was gonna happen at WM24, but Dave wanted the shot instead of Shawn, thus the "jealousy" storyline.      One bonus statement - the wrestler who deserves the most respect for all he has done for WWE & wrestling as a whole - Shawn Michaels.  From the Montreal Incident to WM24 to this thing JBL, try to find someone who has gone through more, personally & professionally, than the Heartbreak Kid & still stayed at the top of the heap!!!!|`|f3AdydqAaa	MR- Undertaker, HBK, HHH  LR- Vladimir Kozlov, Hardcore Holly|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Most Respected: Undertaker  Least Respected: Michael Cole (you said person, not wrestler)|`|Gr7My8FTaa	Ric Flair, Undertaker, Shawn micheals|`|B8xXBR5Uaa	Undertaker,Hbk,HHH,Cena  Kane(he should get a push)and i cant remeber the rest right now!|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Eddie Guerrero  WQ: Vladimir Kozlov|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Jeff Hardy.

3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	I agree with you about Game Commissions, especially the Pa. Game Commission has, and is Destroying the Whitetail Deer Herds in Pennsylvania, because of selling way to many Doe Tags, and permitting Hunters to shoot Three (3*) or more Animals combined with all the different licenses, and seasons.* The Whitetail Deer population is extremely low in Pa. because of mismanagement by the Game Commission, and the Forest Industry.* Its a Damn shame.*|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Take it up with your local biologists. In most places, the doe kill is essential. Overpopulation, not under, is the problem. Not to mention that if you don't kill does, you wind up with some ridiculous buck-to-doe ratio. I've seen it as much as one-to-seven. A good doe kill can give you the right size herd with a one-to-one population. It also works well alongside a quality buck management program.  You're completely oversimplifying.|`|DAtIypvzaa	First of all real hunters would hunt bucks and does equally beacause true hunters dont hunt to kill they hunt to preserve wildlife.  Does are much more overpopulated than bucks.

I will use my State of Michigan, USA as an example...     There are just too many Deer...  by harvesting more doe deer, we bring down the numbers...  simple as that.   Now personally I find that the illusion of Quality Deer Management, does not have the average hunter in mind.  In Michigan, Hunters have been given opportunity to take two Bucks as a limit, with the second Buck must having at least Three countable points off one antler...  Also depending on the "Game Management Unit" a hunter can purchase, over the counter, one "Antlerless" tag per every twenty-four hours.  As for your question, a hunter that only hunts for the doe deer, don't get to bent out of shape, they are hunting, hopefully legally, and let them,  that means more bucks for you to hunt.     and to ease your stress go to your states DNR/Fish and Game website to learn what your biologist are estimating is the size of the overall heard and the break down buck to doe ratio.  Doe's will out number buck that is just part of the species habit.  yet if there is a gross overage either way then more tags are going to be available.    One last thing,  you also must understand too is the number of vehicle/deer accidents in your state... though the numbers are counted as a total because, well after a big truck makes contact, sometimes there is not enough left to make a determination as to what sex it was.  If these numbers are in the 10's of thousands and that is just an estimate because most of the Truck deer encounters for the most part are not reported to police because a truck doesn't gets damaged like a car {Truck, meaning 18-wheeler}  with that, you keep on shooting the buck, and let the other shoot the doe...  for they are still having to pay the same amount for that box of ammo as you do.|`|4Uaiy4Ejaa	It is not about pride it is about food.  If I have to choose between eating a doe or eating nothing I will shoot the doe to eat her.|`|mGYaT87baa	Where I hunt in Wisconsin, I am required to shoot a Doe before I am allowed to shoot a buck. Not enough hunters anymore to control the population. Caprine Wasing Disease (CWD) is spreading due to overpopulation, and the DNR is doing everything they can to reduce the herd. I think there are fewer deer now, but there are more bucks than there used to be. There are also fewer hunters, and that leads to fewer deer being chased around and seen.    The real problem is not that there are too many deer harvested, but there are not enough new hunters! For every new hunter that takes up the sport, two or three retire.|`|aDNdND6oaa	I shoot em with a bow, I don't pay for the land I hunt, and I know how to spell.  Your education astounds me.

If you shut your mouth you might learn something. Try reading some articles in the hunting magazines and L...E...A...R....N something before you come on here insulting the people that know a hell of a lot more than you, Junior.      I'd like to take you on a long, long walk larry. You have been reported Junior.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	actually a hunter is a better hunter if he/she takes more does than bucks- especially depending on the deer population and the doe-to-buck ratio    it's NOT depleting the deer herds, by removing does, the bucks will be able to breed with more does, so there will be more born, if more bucks were taken than does, the bucks wouldn't be able to breed ALL the does    and any one with half a brain KNOWS that the buck is the MAJOR part of the breeding stock- IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO!  ain't like all the does can make themselves prego, it takes bucks (the males) to do that and if does out numbered the bucks greatly, the bucks would have a VERY hard time tracking and breeding with EVERY doe in the area, so reducing the doe population will make breeding easier, thus more does will become prego     where the hell do you get off by saying that it take so hunting skills?! you probably have never been hunting in before! if you did, you'd know  that DOES ARE JUST AS HARD TO HUNT AS BUCKS  actually, does are probably harder to hunt because the maternal instincts      heck- its ignorant people like you who do nothing for us, you and other people like you make it harder on us|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Because intelligent hunters know that for the herd to remain healthy we must kill some does. If the state is selling doe permits, then it wants the does killed to balance the herd. Reducing the herd leaves more forage for the remaining deer. The does will have more twins, and the fawns will be healthier. The bucks will grow bigger racks. This is all known science for anyone with have a brain.    If you don't want to hunt does, fine, just let someone else buy the tag and fill it. They will enjoy a freezer full of tender venison while you gnaw on a tough old buck.    Oh, and once you start hunting does they get smart real quick. Do you really think that bucks are born smarter than does. They learn to be cautious from being hunted. Does do the same thing. You still got to be in the right spot, and make the shot. It takes the same skills, just less luck than waiting and hoping for a big buck.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	So how is shooting a doe any different than shooting a buck?  Meat is meat.  The antlers are just for show, and you can't eat them.  In some states, the mortality rate for bucks is well over 90% by 18 months.  That means that there is a huge surplus of does, and the environment can only support so many total deer.  So if you want more bucks, you are going to have to remove some of the does.  As for killing off the breeding stock, there are already more deer in most areas than the ecosystem can support long term.  As a result, you are getting lots of smaller, undernourished deer that are more prone to disease and starvation.  Again, killing off some of the does helps this situation as well.  Now, as for real hunters, I ask you, who is the real hunter?  The guy that only wants to go get the big bucks because he is compensating for personal um... deficiencies?  Or the hunter that is willing to do what is best to manage the herd?  You are hunting them with a rifle in most cases.  It doesn't take any more skill or talent to kill a buck.  You are pulling a trigger.  That's it.  If you were going out and wrestling them down to the ground and beating them senseless with nothing more than a codpiece, I would say that the bucks are more challenging.  But pulling a trigger on a doe is just the same as pulling the trigger on a buck.  You just don't have to wait as long hoping to see one with bigger antlers.|`|AA11694178	The simple fact is that in many areas, you need to kill off a certain number of does to keep the herd within controlled limits.  Too many breeding does will soon overpopulate an area and result in rampant diseases and starvation.  A properly managed herd will produce healthier and larger deer than one where too many does are breeding.  That is the explanation from a game management position.    Hunters like to kill does because doe meat is more tender and tastier than meat from a buck.  When a hunter has a chance to harvest a doe, he ought to do so.  The herd will be better off for it and he will be able to put a better grade of venison on his table.  Antlers are pretty on the wall but make very poor soup.  The ranch in Texas where I used to hunt would allow you to take two bucks but the rule was that you had to take a doe before you could take your second buck.  One year, he was having problems with wild hogs so he required that you take a doe and a hog before taking your second buck.    If this doesn't sound right to you, talk to your local game warden or wildlife biologist.  Maybe they can help you understand modern game herd management.  They will tell you that there are times when it is imperative that does be harvested and hunters are the best and most economical way of doing this.  The herd is kept healthier and the hunter has a better grade of venison on his table.  Its a win/ win situation.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Hunters are killing does the game management agencies are telling them to. The game management agencies are telling them to is because its the fastest way to reduce the deer population and keep it at manageable levels. The reason management agencies are finally pushing to reduce the deer populations is that currently the deer herds are too large and are causing environmental damage to forests, hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to farmers crops, millions in damage to ornamental plants around houses, and thousands of deer-car collisions (which kill people, and cost over 1 billion dollars in damage).     As for why does... If you just shoot bucks the surviving bucks will breed the does and the population will rebound when the fawns are born in the spring. If you shoot does, not only do you reduce the number of deer, you also reduce the number of females that can give birth to deer in the spring and in the following years letting you drop the deer population to sustainable levels and keep it there.|`|xOReEw6Waa	Actually the doe permits are inline with proper herd management techniques. It isn't the always the ratio of does and bucks that determines the harvest,but the total carrying capacity of the resources for the entire population. So, you need a good mix of bucks and does, especially an age mix in the buck population,but you need to maintain herd numbers that are sustainable within the gender mix. Too many deer are not a good option in the long run, and too many does make the ratios out of proportion. So, the long term approach is taking some does. Friend of mine is with Idaho Fish and Game,another in Washington State and both agree with the doe hunts.  My son and I went out hunting this last fall, he has an option for does (he is almost 12 now) but he wanted a buck for his first deer.|`|nooi0ldjaa	yeah, great idea...lets kill every thing in the woods with balls!    its called heard management so you have a good number of males and females...and in turn have a healthy heard.    sure females carry the young, but without males AND females there would be no young to carry.    a doe is just as hard to kill as a buck, just because it has balls don't give it a eye in the back of its head...seems like you have no hunting exprience at all...|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Because the herds in most Eastern States are over populated and must be reduced for the health of the species. What happened to your education? Western States are not allowing does to be taken period. At least NM, CO, and AZ. TX is over ran by little white tails that have been reduced in size to about that of a Lab Retriever due to over population of habitat. DUH|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Hey I represent that!  Err; resent that!    Are you saying that those who shoot does have only "half a brain"?    "dumb as doe" --> dumb *** doe  "and no hunting for bucks" --> and not hunting for bucks  "depleting are deer herds." --> depleting our deer herds  "brain knows u don't"  --> brain knows you don't    Next time you want to degrade the mental capacity of a people group; at least check your spelling and grammar first.    No hunting skills required for shooting does?  I beg to differ.  I'm prouder of the doe I shot at twenty yards with my 357 handgun than I am of the 7 point buck I shot at 50 yards with a 30/30 win.        Shooting bucks is great; but I'm not above shooting a doe to provide meat for my household.  The DNR controls the number of doe permits and they have a better understanding of deer ecology than I do.  If they issue a doe tag to me, I will put meat in the freezer if given the opportunity.  (I've never been able to gnaw on the antlers anyway)|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Listen State Wildlife officials set the number of tags issued in response to habitat availability and food availability.  No offense but I think the scientists in these organizations know a lot more about the health of a deer herd than some holier than thou 12 year old on yahoo answers.

It's not the first time that it's happened, according to the article, so I'm surprised that the FCC isn't all over Comcast for repeated incidents.|`|AA12103453	Yeah somebody mentioned about it on here last night like right after the game or so. Guess now we all have confirmation of it, man that would freak you out though.
51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	You are correct, both feet or one other body part (knee, elbow, hand, head, etc.) need to make contact inbounds for a catch to count in the NFL.  In college or high school, only one foot or other body part needs to touch the ground.    No, it does not count in the NFL if your foot is on top of your own foot.  However, I do believe it counts if it comes to rest on another player who is in bounds.|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	both feet DID touch the ground!! did you see the replay?!    if they didnt, even if it looked a little bit like they didnt, the ref wouldnt have counted it!!!    im glad they won!!  whooopp whooooop!!|`|QtjnmEzoaa	You are correct that both feet have to touch in bounds. Often, even with the situation you described, it will be ruled a touchdown on the field. In order to overturn the ruling, they have to have indisputable evidence. In this case it would be extremely difficult to have the kind of evidence required to overturn it based on the zoom and quality of the picture. I believe firmly that last night's play was a touchdown based on a lot of replay, but I can certainly see where you're coming from and you have a valid point. I just don't think we have the technology at this point to do much about it.|`|MaizmvvMaa	No, your right both feet do need to touch, it does touch, at first you can see it a bit off the ground maybe an inch or so, very close but just before the guy hits him you see it drop that inch and touch the ground. Very close call.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	They both did. Watch the replay without your Cardinal colored glasses on.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|dfo8gSaraa	Yes, they do and yes they DID.    Look at the picture about halfway down:  http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=dw...|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	The ref on the field makes the call.  The review ref needs incontrovertible evidence he screwed up.  It was too close to contradict the guy right there.    If it helps, me 1,000 miles away could not tell either.  I have to assume the guy ten feet or so from the play got it right.  I'd say that if he said it was out of bounds too.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	yea or the toes as long as something from each foot touches inbounds its a touchdown that catch was GOOD and i routed for the cards  trust me ive watched ALOT of football in my day and that WAS a touchdown no if ands or buts about it|`|yDuGraj8aa	The refs reviewed this catch over and over and both feets toes tapped the ground.  Im 100% positive the refs no more then you. GET OVER IT|`|2qQPBDlkaa	yes and no....      yes you have to establish your possession in bounds.. commonly this means both feet down in bounds... HOWEVER    it can also be one knee or any other part of the body other then hands and feet....     takes two hands two feet or any other piece of you touching in bounds to count.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Both feet need to be down, which they were.|`|jrRpaQEeaa	Yes they do, and to me it did look like they both touched the ground(lucky catch)|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Yeah, both feet have to touch the ground, even if it's just the tips of the toes. I thought the same thing when I saw the replay ... I thought Holmes' second foot was on the back of his first foot. I guess the officials had a better view than we did at home.    And before anyone thumbs-down this answer, I'm not crying about it. I don't have a dog in this hunt. My favorite team wasn't playing, and I was fine with the Steelers winning. I just thought the same thing as the questioner when I saw the replay.
LdJFFvSVaa	Wolves - Coventry 6 million  Coventry - Inter 13 million  Inter - Leeds 9 million  Leeds - Tottenham 7 million  Tottenham - Liverpool 20 million  Liverpool - Tottenham 12 million (rising to 15)    Altogether that's 70 million, LMAO I hope he's proud of himself : )|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	6m > Wolves  13m > Inter Milan  12m > Leeds  7m > Tottenham  19m > Liverpool  12m > Tottenham    69m - My god!|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Too much.

MaizmvvMaa	NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira confirmed that Kurt Warner fumbled on the Cardinals' last play of the Super Bowl.  Announcer Al Michaels claimed there was a quick booth review at the end and Pereira confirmed that as well. Neither Warner nor head coach Ken Whisenhunt believed there was a review and both were quite miffed about it after the game. The odds of a Hail Mary touchdown were incredibility slim, but Pereira's confirmation about the review and the fumble at least offer some closure to an epic game.|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	They did. And to me it looked like a fumble. If you were watching it on NBC instead of online or any other channel, you might have been in a commercial break or something. It was very quick.    :] GO PATRIOTS|`|WQGuO3fJaa	It was apparently reviewed in the booth. They didn't review it on the field because the NFL and the media loves the steelers (check out how many reporters are claiming the Steelers to be the best franchise of all time even though they are easily the dirtiest). I am an Eagle's fan, the last play should have been reviewed on the field, even if it wasn't overturned. They reviewed the Holmes catch, they needed to review that as well.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	they already overturned the first touchdown by big ben in the beginning.  so they didnt want to over turn another like the harrison int return or the holmes td at the end.  so they didnt even want to look at the incomplete pass by warner at the end. they jus wanted to keep it as a fumble an get the game over|`|3nWLLWPpaa	they did review it were u watching?|`|LVjM9k8yaa	It was reviewed upstairs. Just because the referee didn't call timeout and go to the sidelines doesn't mean the replay booth wasn't looking at it. If they had thought his arm was going forward the game would have been stopped and Arizona would have gotten the ball back. His arm didn't move forward until the ball was already out.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|wLHjvTuBaa	i rooted for the cardinals    but i guess you didnt see it|`|0080cddfd4f4c4bb9ed2462f9f69e09aaa	They did review the play, and they said that Kurt Warner lost control of the ball when he brought his arm back and that the ball simply went forward after that.|`|AA10939368	The play was officially reviewed in the booth as there was less than two minutes left on the clock.  It was confirmed to be a fumble.  The ball was hit out of his hands prior to forward motion.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Didn't see the refs review Warner's play at the end of the game, but if this many people say there was a review I guess I just missed it...?    Anyway, the way the NFL handles replays is just asinine  - why doesn't the NFL just have an extra referee in the booth reviewing every single play in between plays?  The TV broadcasters have no problem doing it.  Take it out of the coaches' hands and just review everything.  The technology to do it already exists.     If the "booth ref" finds an error or questions a call, he could then just call down to the ref on the field and correct the call himself and the game could go on.  This would prevent the inevitable 5 minute delays in every game due to "challenges"and it would also prevent coaches from having to risk losing precious time-outs to guess at calls they see from as far as 50 yards away at full game speed.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	There is a replay official (someone with actual on the field officiating experience at the NCAA 1A or NFL level) in the replay booth with a technician.  The official is the person who talks to the referee on the field during reviews and the technician sets up the different camera angles for the referee to see.    In the last two minutes of a half, the replay official reviews every play and, if he thinks he sees something that may overturn the call or that the call was close enough that it warrants a second look, he then sends a signal to a pager-like device worn by the referee and the umpire on the field.  Thus, each play is reviewed by a qualified official.    In this case, the replay showed it was clearly a fumble.  The ball was knocked out of the QB's hand before he started moving his arm forward.  He must have complete control of the ball along with moving his hand forward for it to be considered a pass.  There was no need for the referee to be buzzed except to try to reduce any conspiracy theories on the part of Cardinal fans and talk radio hosts.|`|MO8SVvMdaa	set up|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	I dislike the Cardnals but there were a lot of  reffs that didn't noticed a lot of things during the game. And it really mad me mad.  The steelers did some things but they got caught.  Cardnals on the other hand didn't.  >:[    The reffs mad me angry more than who won.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think the nfl is saying that they did review it but there was not enough to overturn it. but if they did it was an unusually fast and quiet review.
BXuT6VTBaa	Hey, yo've just stumbled across an amazing toe toucher ( I don't mean to be full of myself) My trick is probably the easiest thing ever. First thing I did was fall asleep in middle splitz. Second is I did a few sit ups, and walla and also don't put your legs up right away, wait unit you've hit your peack then thrust your legs up with every thing you have.   P.S. cheerleading is a sport it's just not in the olympics because it is not world wide.  P.P.S. Football isn't in the Olympics either. :)|`|X7IsNqI7aa	look online and find hip flexor stretches!  hip flexors help you bring your legs up!  dont sit in your jump keep you back straight and chin up and also bring your legs to you (arms straight also)!  stretch alot! but dont overstretch yourself because you can pull a muscle!|`|fMWeRrJTaa	lift your legs to the side while standing up straight. do at least 10 on each side. lay on the floor and do a v-up but when coming up put your kegs in a toe touch position. use ankle weights. Also use these when doing the other exercises. just keep practicing and you will get it!!! good luck!!!!!

Mya9LUxuaa	Continue to do track.  It's a great sport and has something for everybody.  With track you will get memories and experiences for the rest of your life.  If you really need a job, get one.  But you can work for the rest of your life, being on your high school track team won't always be there.|`|5i785w12aa	School is the most important thing.  Do whatever gives you the most time for your work.  What the best solution might be is to do neither and if you are able to get really good grades that will pay for itself in a scholarship for college.|`|qQq23yziaa	I think they care. I am 50 years old now, ran track in high school and it was a great time. You have the rest of your life to get a job. Enjoy sports while you can still do them|`|5lpi9zMcaa	i think a job but thats my opinion i don't find running around the track very fun it bores me|`|fOMcLCCcaa	I think with a job you would have the same stress.  And your meant to have fun in high school, so if I were you, I'd join it...you'll always have college to have a job.    Unless you drive and need to pay for gas, or you want to but you own things, then I don't think a high schools needs a job.
wnyPTH0waa	alright, so back bend kickovers arent as hard as you think they are.:P     for the which legs kick over first, it basically depends which is your "good leg", or the leg that when you kick over, feels the most natural to go first. For most people its the side they write with, usually the right leg goes first. But for some people their left leg feels more natural to them to kick first.     so basically, a backbend kick over works like this:  when youre in the bridge, the leg you kick over with (that i just explained) lifts up, and  the other leg thats on the floor kicks really hard to push your body over.    so i would suggest to start off, have someone beside your body to hold your back when you go down into the bridge in case you collapse or get scared. So once youre in the bridge, you push with your leg thats on the floor, and bring the other leg up. The person spotting you can help push your leg over if you get stuck in midair. :P    Once you start getting comfortable with this, the person can spot you less by just having a han on your back, and then just have a finger, and then just to be beside you in case you need help.    i really hope this helps:)  good luck!!!:)

Ar5VHDiBaa	they could call it Choke Park|`|c6q3EERdaa	I thought the Citi naming was stupid in the first place. Jackie Robinson Park wouldn't be a much better idea. I think the Mets screwed themselves over with the naming. Shea would've been a better idea, just like the Cardinals kept the Busch Stadium name when their new park was finished in 06.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I agree with all that money going to waist. They should have named it shea Jr lol. I think there already doing to much for jackie robinson a guy who didnt even play on our team, let alone naming a stadium after him. Btw awesome user name lol|`|RW7qVMk5aa	Thats retarded. That's like getting mad at the Orlando magic and a bunch of other NBA teams for retiring MJ's number, except worse|`|zLGqPFmHaa	Because they want to be dramatic and attract the hype of naming after him. They feel like they have some special connection with Jacki becuase they see themselves as replacements for the Dodgers in NY, while they rely are the replacement for the Giants. They want the name to have meaning, just as Yankee Stadium is world know. They want to match the Yankees, just as they  named their Spring Training field Traditions Field, despite the lack of any tradition in the Mets history what so ever. They were trying to copy the yankees Legends Field. I am an Angels fan so don't think im biased.|`|e7B8WkkIaa	There is a lot of simple PC here. All teams retired his number. The MLB will do anything to brand his likeness, for some reason.   How about Felix Milan Stadium.   Omar likes all things Latin. It could work.|`|KiJPlhUmaa	I totally agree the mets should just have Shea Stadium as there name. I never even like Citi-Field, and Jackie Robinson Park is just being rude to all of the great met players like Tom Seaver, I would rather have the stadium being called Tom Seaver Park, then Jackie Robinson Park.

Cb5N6UaQaa	Didn't Paul Pierce suffer a similar injury to that of Andrew Bynum in game 1 of the 2008 Finals?    My answer is: No. Paul Pierce FAKED to suffer a similar injury to that of Andrew Bynum in game 1 of the 2008 Finals.    Or intended to at least. Don 't listen to this jokers that clearly don't understand the real question here. Paul Pierce should really call himself The LIE instead of the Truth. That is insult to injury.

Pierce was HURT, ie, the fall caused alot of PAIN.  Bynum is injured, ie, the fall caused something to break in his obviously fragile body.     So being that Pierce came back and played and kicked the lakers around some more, and bynum is out for how many weeks again? who's the puzzy?     I don't want to be like the so called laker 'fans' who are just kobe lovers, so I won't say any more except you twits get just what you all deserve.

75ZMWlnnaa	djoker played some great tennis at the beginning of 2008, by winning AO, then winning indian wells, and then rome- ok thats 3 BIG tournaments in a space of 4 months, so as u say, i guess he did peak a bit too soon, he was riding a huge wave of confidence and momentum.    the turning point was that match against rafa at hamburg in the SF, where the no.2 ranking was on the line, if he had beaten rafa, djoker would have been no.2, he lost to rafa in a high-quality 3 setter, and i think his confidence after that loss just dropped a few notches. he COULD have won in straight sets.    then came wimbledon, where everybody was expecting djoker to face fed in the SF, instead he gets torn to shreds by safin in the 2nd round, his confidence and his huge ego were deflated by a million notches.    he lost to andy murray in toronto and cincinnati, that was when murray really made his charge so to speak.    olympics match against rafa, he must still be having nightmares about match point when he missed a very easy overhead, djoker so wanted to win the gold medal, but at least he won the bronze.    us open- he lost to an in-form federer, revenge was on fed's mind, and djoker really did not stand much of a chance, he got demolished in the 1st and 4th sets there.    he is INCONSISTENT, lets face it, he did not win a single title between may and november last year, and yeh he won the masters cup because he got drawn into the easier group and played against davydenko in the final who is one of the biggest chokers in the game...    and this is the truth: if djoker ever plays against a healthy rafa or a healthy roger, he is going to lose, he simply can not compete at their level, those 2 are great, id say djoker is just good, same thing with murray and the other youngsters like tsonga, simon, gulbis.    i feel that murray is going to be no.3 before djoker can even become no.2. i would not be surprised to see djoker slip down to no.4 or no.5 by the end of this year.    n i see rafa and roger holding no.1 and no.2 for quite a while.    n also lets not forget that djoker has had a number of chances to become no.2, hamburg SF against rafa, french open SF against rafa, tennis masters cup (he just had to win against tsonga in his last RR match, but he lost), brisbane intl (he just had to get to the F, but loses 1st round to gulbis in straights), and then in sydney (he just had to beat nieminen of all people in SF, and he lost in straights).    that was FIVE opportunities he has had to prove he was worthy of being world no.2, but no more chances are going to fall his way unless rafa or roger comes down with a serious injury and are out of the game for a while (which i hope does not happen).|`|ASbdsqFSaa	Because before the Australian Open he was only 50 points behind Federer in the rankings. But now that the Australian Open Federer would have gained a lot of points as Djokovic would have lost points as he retired from his Quarter final with Roddick, where as Federer made the final. Djokovic had more points to defend as he was the defending champ where as Federer didn't.    In order to retain the 1000 points Novak gained from winning it last year he would've needed to win the tournament. He didn't, sadly Nadal did :(    I hope this answers your question :)|`|8326e8ed18368243be0734a4088435e3aa	It's just delusions of grandeur.|`|k6M48eUMaa	I have no idea.

Steelers- Harris, Lambert, Ham or Bradshaw.  It show's more respect to the team and you know those player's are retired and can't be traded.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	the BEARS Tommy Harris is the one of the best|`|OUKKNF1eaa	i have jack lambert. wanted mel blount but couldnt find one.|`|XHharKJgaa	For Bears, go with Matt Forte or Devin Hester.

30LMCJrAaa	They have so many needs, they should trade down for more picks.     As for qb, free agency or later in the draft.

AA12243350	ramp and throat it, extended beaver tail grip safety with "memory bump", extended thumb safety (not ambi), matched sear  & disconnector, fit a match barrel and bushing, no full length guide rod, commander hammer,  night sites,  replace trigger. then start polishing all the parts and pieces. fit the slide.  And this is just the minnimum I'd do.  I'm not going to go into the fine tuning, it would take several pages to give all the info. pick up "the book of the .45" by Dean Grennel for some excellent ideas on building a .45 cor CCW.  shoot safe|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Honestly? I like my Rock Island the way it is.     The finish has a bit of holster-wear on the slide, but it's still as strong as ever.

There is no customization, and anyone who says it is not an accurate piece has never been shot at by me. At gunfighting distance it is an excellent shooter.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	I wouldn't in most cases, as there are better (and smaller) guns out there that work better for CCW.  However, if you have your heart set on it, here is what you might consider:    Add some low profile CCW sights, like Novak or Xpress.    Have the hammer replaced with a commander style hammer or some other version that snags less.    Have a slightly larger grip safety installed to keep the hammer from "biting" you.  Not a full beavertail, as that doesn't always work with a CCW gun.    Have the ejection port flared to increase the ejection reliability.    Have all of the sharp edges on the outside of the gun smoothed down.    Have the entire thing refinished with duracoat or some other corrosion resistant coating.    Possibly have the mainspring and mainspring housing bobbed.|`|HdSaN24caa	if you're going to carry it, why not get a smaller version?  it's pretty hard to hide a regular size .45. go ask any gun store, and don't wait too long. they're working overtime on new gun laws.|`|AA10232434	better check exactly what the GI version is, i think it has military spec. tolerances making it less accurate.... and i would also get a 4 inch barrel... and i don't like the fact that 1911's have to be in the c.ocked position to be ready (single action) i would prefer a double/single action like a sig sauer, but that is wider than a 1911... my personal choice is a 357 snub
AA12243350	save your money. If "glare" is your concern, get a parkerized finish put on it. Improve the GI sites by replacing them with Novaks, or night sites. Checkering on a pistol has no place other than possibly in front of the grips on the frame, but I prefer to add Hogue wrap around grips if you feel the need. These cost a lot less than checkering and give a better grip anyway.  shoot safe|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Grooves are not going to lighten the weapon by any appreciable amount--we're talking grams here--and if weight was your primary concern, I doubt you'd be carrying a 1911 ;). It's not a bad feature to have if the gun happens to come with it, but I don't see it as something worth spending money on. Grooves are intended to give you a better grip when racking the slide, especially in a panic situation where your dexterity is impaired and your hands may be sweaty. However, most people carry their 1911's condition 1 anyway (round in chamber, hammer back, safety on)...so that benefit is pretty negligible.    Edit: I realize that "hammer back" is not the common phrase. Apparently the censors have deemed the word "c0cked" to be naughty.
TuOp3hNPaa	he should. its better to leave early an have ppl think u should of stayed than stay an have ppl think u should of retired.  like farve he should of jus stayed in retirment but since he didnt he left a bad taste in everybodies mouth about him. now when i think of him i think ya that guy shoulda retired instead of wow he was a good qb|`|XHharKJgaa	I think he will retire, he's had a great career. If I were him, I'd really want to play again, but I'd be reluctant because he will never have another year as good as the one he had this year and obviously, you always want to end on a high note. Even though the Cards didn't win, this is definitely a high note for Warner after the past few years of struggle.|`|8juUgSK2aa	no way. Only if he won. He is coming back.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	i sure hope not
dDhTMacAaa	I am, especially after he thought he was in SmackDown while NBC had about thirty-six cameras on him.

JK! : D I think that there may be some more deserving fellows, but he is a potential hall o famer|`|AA10021709	No Way|`|zSRdNxJvaa	Yes. He put up Hall of Fame numbers in last night's game alone. Win or Lose last night he definitly deserves a Hall of Fame spot.|`|rlJx7JSQaa	ABSOLUTELY!|`|xP08melDaa	Thats a tough one but im gonna say YES... hes got a super bowl ring and MVP and hes made appearances in 3 superbowls in his career.... he also has beast stats at is in the top 10 all time so YES definitely|`|RY5nmWlgaa	yes.|`|EvDoLydgaa	yes|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I think it depends on who else is eligible for the Hall while he is. He's had 3 absolutely incredible years, but he's had the same number of horrible years plus several where he was entirely off the map. We all know he can play, and he has some monster stats to prove it. The only issue I see is longevity. He hasn't had those stats for as many years as HOF caliber quarterbacks generally do. If in the coming years the Hall eligibles are fairly weak, he'll get in. But if he has immense competition (remember, he'll be around the same class as Brett Favre, who is a lock) considering there are only 6 spots per year then he won't. I can almost guarantee he won't get in the first year he's eligible. But I wouldn't be completely shocked if he made it at some point during his eligibility.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Yes, Kurt Warner is indeed a Hall of Famer.|`|qAqsz3bBaa	yes

Good luck!|`|K5AeQuSNaa	peanut oil and feed corn.  This works even better if you let it soak in the sun for a couple of days.  You can also add some berries or anchovies, though I would wait to add those at the end.|`|lAWi4Mv0aa	well i know a good ol trick. get you some fresh corn and some cooking grease. throw in a big old piece of sponge. When the hogs eat it the sponge will swell inside them. Then they won't be able to p o o it back out. This will cause them to die. This also works good for coyote and opposum.
VXQFT341aa	The cowboys will never win a Super Bowl again as long as Jerry Jones is the owner. Look at what he has done. Instead of building a team thru the draft and having those young players make their mark and come together as a team, He signs head cases and has 53 individuals instead of teammates that respect each other. Daniel Snyder of the of the Redskins is the same. And remember Good Ole Boy Jerry ran Tom Landry out of town. So Chad can keep dreaming. You cant buy championships anymore. Dallas does not have 6 SB titles.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	BOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Top dogs once again? I didn't know 6 (Cowboys) > 6 (Steelers), the numbers look the same to me...

Johnson is faster even though both Fitzgerald and Johnson are around 6'2" 6'3". The only reason Fitzgerald comes up consistent while Johnson doesn't is because Fitzgerald has the better quarterback (Kurt Warner to Matt Schaub, is that even a comparison?) and Fitzgerald gets to play against the lame NFC West (Johnson gets the Colts, Titans, Jags). If Johnson got to play in the NFC West and had Kurt Warner, Johnson would have the better numbers.

Doesnt it suck when MILLIONS of people on the world wide stage know how Pittsburgh has won its last 2?  We all know about the 70s an how they won.  I used to honestly respect them but I have NO respect for a team that doesnt earn its championships. NO respect towards them.  They earned their way there an were handed another one.  Let me ask you this............Is Barry Bonds the home run king?  Answer that question for me.      Steroids    HGH anyone?      http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/...

No, they sure wont take their Super Bowls away but I like to educate people on facts. I have provided factual evidence in links on each post.   I have nothing but time.

ovvC9NeCaa	Yes, I think that Bama's gonna win too, except maybe not by 21  Vt's Defense isn't THAT bad and they always play physical  but Bama's going to win cause they have a great defense returning,  plus one of the top five recruiting classes this year  they also have some key players returning on offense    Go 'Bama!!!! :)
rNUyV1EYaa	Nothing is going on right now. The Cowboys are having discussions internally about whether Owens will be on the team next season; and that is all.    They have until June 1st to make a roster decision on T.O.; so we may not get an answer until then.|`|u7GBP579aa	i know that the cowboys dont want him and he is a cancer to the locker room. He has to much cap with the team so the best thing to do is trade maybe for a defensive player like a linebacker. Lets not forget they have Roy williams|`|pWvGbTdcaa	Well, I haven't heard anything about TO getting traded, I've heard that there is a chance of the Cowboys releasing him, but not trading him.|`|RK9bJPOmaa	nothing yet. they are still keeping him.

5v1krJWeaa	They seem to be looking at orlando cabrera, but also they need depth in the bullpen. They could get some good prospects with a deadline trade this year for Holliday. Honestly they really don't have a chance this year for the AL west or wild card. they have to build up a better farm system. They have that from getting players like Bobby Crosby and Hudston Street but they have to keep them and pull of a 96' Yankees.|`|k5zvA1X9aa	Trading Matt Holliday for some good prospects and an everyday player.
c94rE8u8aa	I'm an Eagles/Phillies fan because my dad comes from Philly and had my fanhood decided before I was born, so:    Yes I'm glad the Steelers won the Super Bowl. They just passed the Cowboys for most Super Bowl wins while defeating the team that knocked us out of the playoffs in what could be McNabb's and Dawkin's last chance at a SB ring. But, I'd rather have the Eagles win it any day, because like I just said, Brian Dawkins and Donovan McNabb are great players who have stuck with the team through the thick and the thin and deserve a championship.|`|XrCc85kNaa	No...  I hate the Steelers.....  But in my mind the Cards won....the Steelers only won because of the refs....    And of course...I would rather have the Eagles win...|`|xIfvXy4waa	I like to consider myself a Pirate fan, Pittsburgh is my town. Of course Steelers, I root for anything in that city.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Of course I'd rather have the Eagles win, but that's because I'm an Eagles fan.  I was rooting for the Steelers though, because the Cards beat the Eagles.    If I wasn't an Eagles fan, it would be Cardinals all the way, because I don't particularly like the Steelers.  I just didn't want to see Arizona win after beating the Eagles.|`|uTvMXhaOaa	for the football one...i wanted the eagles but i am glad a philly team was in it and won!    and i am a HUGE Phillies fan!!! kidding me? world series champs! do you know how much stress they put us through these last few seasons?! getting in then not winning then winning! and we have utley and howard...along with victorino (my favorite) and hamels :)|`|zy9XbvSraa	Everyone in philly including me would love the eagles to win and you guys know we are going to win the nhl cup.

Phillies, because I'm addicted to them.|`|nxymxSUFaa	As an Eagles fan I would much rather have seen the Eagles in the Super Bowl.  For some reason the 9-7 Cardinals didn't merit being on a "world championship" game.  For that matter the 9-6-1 Eagles really didn't belong in the SB either.  The next best thing was to see the Steelers win the SB.  They proved all season long that they were the best team in the AFC.  The certainly were the better team last night.      Like baseball, the present NFL playoff structure allows for mediocre teams to end up in championship games and I think it's wrong.  In 2006 the 83-78 St. Louis Cardinals won the world series which I thought was undeserving considering they did not distinguish themselves during the regular season.  The same goes for the Arizona Cardinals.  9-7 just doesn't cut it.  I'm glad the Steelers won the game.
USfjlrLNaa	it did...but....the rule was changed in the 90's saying that if a receiver controlled the ball, even if the ball touches the ground...then it is a completed pass.  I think the game was the 1998 NFC Championship game when the Tampa Bay Bucs had a receiver had a play where he caught the ball, but the ball touched the ground and it was overturned. They then changed the rule the next year, so that as long as the receiver maintains control of the ball then it is a catch.|`|huHOpRLLaa	lol  i didnt notice|`|sl8ffVHVaa	Yes it did but Pittsburgh didn't challenge it.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	didn't matter they kicked the field goal before they had a chance to look at the play , so the TD stays. his hands were clearly underneath the football even if the football makes contact with the ground if _B_O_T_H hands are underneath the ball it counts as a reception. otherwise santoinio holmes TD would not have counted the ball hit the ground when he did but both hands where underneath the ball.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	It may have glazed it Eric. But remember there is additional latitude given during the Superbowl for plays of that type due to the pressure and intensity of the game.    The NFL admitted some time ago that there will be some latitude on very close calls during the SB. Which is why there are all the challenges allowed. But no, we can't allow it to get real sloppy with officiating I mean it is the big game.|`|VtC3AP5Gaa	NO. Cardinals all the way!|`|spBnMPzFaa	it's not incomplete if his hand is under the ball, but I thought the steelers would challenge the catch, because I noticed it too.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Fitz had possesion of the ball on the way down though.  And if it was called incomplete, the refs probly would have called interference on the Steelers because Taylor was blocking out Larry's facemask while the ball was in the air.  Overall, it was a good catch.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Just you. Get over it, you won. Let the Cardinals fans make idiots of themselves with the crying and conspiricy theories.    45-35  Enough Said!

In my opinion the Super Bowl should be in a dome every year, either that or a climate with perfect weather that time of year.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	They do this so that the fans and the teams are put in the best climate conditions possible to play and act their best.

TLmiDaLCaa	It was an absolutely cheap shot.  The ref was looking at him.  Most of it occurred after the flag was thrown.  The refs have no excuse whatsoever for not ejecting him.  Even  John Madden, who defended a rather dirty batch of Raiders over the  years, thought it should have been a certain ejection.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	*passes out kleenex to all the crybabies*    it's the nfl ladies not nursery school.  if he punches you, punch back.  players throw cheap shots the whole game on both sides of the ball.  it's part of the game.  yeah like his punch is gonna hurt a guy that's covered head to toe in pads and gets linebackers throwing their entire bodies at him the whole game.|`|eOQ8rGqCaa	You know he was an *** when a die hard Steelers fan is pissed off at what he did to that Cards player he should have been kicked out of the game and I have lost a lot of respect for that guy.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	It's football. It's the biggest game of the year. Millions of people have money on the outcome, over/under, the score at halftime, etc.. The game is intense, the players are ecstastic and psyched to be playing .. do you really expect players' emotions to not get the better of them in that sort of atmosphere? Harrison's been physical and aggressive like that all year. He may have been a LITTLE out of line, but stop looking for excuses, people make mistakes, it's life. Move on.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I think that Harrison should have been ejected.  There was no reason to punch that guy after the play.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	I think the game was bought. And as far as the illegal punches and etc.  The player got by with it because of what he is not who he is.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	STOP complaining!!!!  The Cards had a great season and played a heck of a game but it is still football. They are gonna hit and yes he got a penalty that was the right call.

Nothing new.  They were doing whatever they could get away with, and so were the Cardinals.  Pittsburgh won, even though I didn't want them too, they won.  Game over.  How it happened, is not important after the fact.  There are hundreds of cheap shots that happened in every single game in every single season.  Arizona gave them a good game, but, it's over.|`|aOx2hovgaa	nope only you..    mess with the best,die like the rest.|`|0SdX6MpWaa	Is it possible for a ref to just brush that off?... I mean when Kris Dielman on the Chargers was ejected for supposedly throwin a punch which he didn't he was ejected so fast, no one knew what the hell was going on... But here you had Harrison who beats his wife, punching this guy and the Cardnials player was doing nothing back, its cuz the Steelers stand behind the raiders in dirty|`|tOIhNyCJaa	DeMarcus Ware:  The REAL NFL Defensive Player of the Year!

Maybe the guy he punched/ personal fouled had some cheapshots on Harrison we couldn't see, or maybe they were jawing for a while.  I don't think it was right what Harrison did, but I wouldn't judge him for it.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Yes, he should have been ejected. The rest of your suggestions are a little over the top and either tainted by your dislike of the Steelers or your favorite team losing the Super Bowl fair and square.

2V3JZ3Wbaa	Alittle of both, wait for a few years and time will tell. He is a  good coach I believe, this organization has an eye for getting really good coaches. One of the very few  organizations in all of sports that doesn't run through 10 coaches in 7 years or so. Maybe others  should take some lessons. I think the  Steelers will get even better though, the Cards showed some of their weakness, they even seemed upset over it. Mike Tomlin even said some of the dimensions of the team is a work in progress after the Super Bowl.|`|wMW2LNkbaa	he had the playmakers already there, but is decent coach.|`|XHharKJgaa	A little of both, Bill Cowher did a lot of the work in bringing this team to where it is. Mike Tomlin refined some of that. However, I have to say if Tomlin wasn't head coach and some Bobby Petrino or Nick Saban is coach, the Steelers would not have won the Super Bowl.|`|q06g4hHKaa	A little of both.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think he has a very good team ,a very good staff and i do believe he will go on to be considered an above average coach, not sure about the "great" label ,time will tell|`|Jp2415Whaa	Players carry the team.  Tomlin's job was made alot easier tbh.  Then again what the team is known for is their D.  And guess who's the D coordinator..Mr. Dick.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	He's only been there 2 years...Its Cowher's team he's winning with...Not to say he isn't a good coach, but the pieces were already there for winning...|`|dL82oSHTaa	I think a Little of both.

I'm guessing the scum bucket is in Arizona? That does it, Cardinal fans have surpassed Sonner fans as the kings of excuses. I didn't think anyone could do that, you should feel proud.    45-35  Enough Said!

Be sure to check out the informative scope video at this Nikon page....    http://www.opticsplanet.net/nikon-rifles...

If you can afford a "really good scope", then start looking through Leupold scopes, Bushnell's higher-end scopes and Nikon scopes.|`|lAWi4Mv0aa	whatever is cheap. considering you wont be shooting no further than 100-150 yards. You dont need something high powered. Go check wal-mart.|`|mmIihkZaaa	Bushnell Banner!! Less than $100 from Cabelas or Bass Pro. Terrific scope for the money. I scoped two .22 rifles with Banners and they are great. I know several lever gun hunters that also swear by them for their 30-30's and 35's.|`|mGYaT87baa	+1 on the Bushnell's and the Nikon's. They are great, and plenty good enough for your .22 . If you have money to burn, Leopold makes a drop dead gorgeous rimfire scope, but it is expensive. Stay away from the cheapest scopes, and pay special attention to the clamps and rings to ensure that it can't wiggle loose.|`|Hb3IrJ85aa	if your Marlin is a mag, I would look at a good scope. I use my 22 mag for fox, cats, and Yotes. I have reached 225 yards with little effort. you should shoot enough to be proficient at long range, NOTE...Marlins are picky on the type of ammo you use, no 2 brands will shoot the same. I have the best group at 150 yds  with CCI  Maxi Mags 40 gr.hp.  My scope is a Bushnell 4-12X50mm, and my grouping is .59 ( about 1/2 inch)  100 yds is dead on with all five rounds touching each other and .1 inch high. ( i zero my rifle for that), I have never lost a critter yet !

BLACK-and-GOLD refs?|`|15wwA3jjaa	I just want to know what kind of dirt the Rooney family has on the NFL, because it seems to me that the Steelers' Super Bowls always seem to involve controversy.    People couldn't say enough about Bill Belichick leaving the field with 2 seconds left on the clock in last year's Super Bowl, well what about the officials allowing Pittsburgh to kneel for the win after an obvious incomplete pass.  It's pretty bad when every post game show is questioning the lack of an official review at the end of the biggest game of the season.  Awefully convenient if you ask me.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Hey Fat Albert share the love brother i believe it was bought too.   Just to many strange things came down on Pittsburgh side.

It was easy to see the fix was on.  I love NFL fans who are blind to what is going on around them.  I hope they get caught in a couple years like the scandal in the NBA.|`|OLESQtjJaa	Zero dallors, Ben Roethlisberger scored on the first drive, but that was overturn and there was no offensive holding foul in the endzone that resulted for a safety|`|CL7OTeiCaa	The refs aren't dumb.

Go Steelers!!!|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	Cry a river...it isn't the refs who ruin the sport...it is whiny crybabies like you who do.

It's time to everyone to stop whining about the game.  Steelers won.  Accept it, and move on.  There are questionable calls in every single game played every year.

G33E41IBaa	You can write him a letter and the Canadiens organization will forward it to him:    Carey Price  c/o The Montreal Canadiens  1275 St. Antoine Street West   Montreal, QC, CANADA   H3C 5L2    I don't know if the Canadiens have open practice for fans or not, but if they do you can ask about their practice schedule.  Typically, some NHL players will sign autographs (some don't because they don't want people to just sell them, but if you ask them to personalize it, for example, To: Sara, they might be more willing).  Most players will certainly take pictures.  Once you're done watching them practice, you can catch them as they leave the ice.  But remember, the team does not always practice during scheduled times, and sometimes the entire team doesn't show up.  Don't get discouraged, just try again.    You can call the Canadiens or fill out a contact form to get in touch and find out if they have open practice times and their location.  You can also contact the team and straight out ask them how you can meet Carey Price.  He may have autograph signings or something that the team can tell you about.  Other than that, I don't know how you can meet him without interfering with his personal life.    http://canadiens.nhl.com/team/app/?servi...

Cabelas has them.  http://www.cabelas.com  and search underwater cameras.|`|AA11016927	The submarine concept would be very cool but very expensive. A wireless underwater camera would not be cheap!    Your "best bet" is what the above posters have described. An underwater ice-fishing camera would be perfect:  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    I have had good results with the above camera for fishing. However, Aqua View is a better brand and will  last longer.    Good luck with your project.

Yes.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Of course they can. They have the talent, they have the experience, and they have one of the rowdiest fanbases of any pro sports team.

THey will NOT lose another Super Bowl ever again.  Its impossible.

Oh ok.
EGe0k8P6aa	Q. Could A 750FPS gun with a pellet kill a ground hog.  A. Possibly. A lot would depend on the pellet weight you're getting 750 fps with and on proper shot placement. Something like a .22 Eun Jin heavy pellet (28 grains) would deliver 35 ft-lbs of energy. A light weight 5 grain .177 pellet would deliver 6.25 ft-lbs at the same velocity. In the article I linked to, Jim Chapman recommended using gun/pellet combinations that yield 30+ ft-lbs to kill ground hogs. Personally I'd recommend something more like an .22 Airforce Condor, or a .25 Sumatra 2500/Career 707 since it would deliver more power and give you a better margin of safety, but I'm simply being cautious.    Q. OK so When a gun says 750fps dose it mean it goes 750 FEET or power wise?  A. 750 fps is a muzzle velocity expressed in feet per second. That is one component in determining the kinetic energy of a gun, but its only a component.|`|km9cQNAXaa	Ground Hogs are tough little critters. For a humane kill you need at least a .22LR at short ranges. I recommend a .22 Magnum at realistic ranges. At longer ranges, like 100 yards a .223 is a better choice.    Ian M|`|nooi0ldjaa	not Living in a area with ground hogs, i cant answer that.    but i can answer "OK so When a gun says 750fps dose it mean it goes 750 FEET or power wise"    750 FPS means the pellet or BB flies 750 feet per sec    F-feet  P-per  S- second -- FPS|`|lAWi4Mv0aa	only if you could pull of a headshot. which that may not kill it either. You'd have to be a real good shot.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	It might rarely be possible, but highly unlikely, if ever.* It would likely wound, and possibly cripple, rather than kill humanely.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	yes, it is done on a regular bases! just look in the airgun hunting forums. the feet per second that is advertised on a gun, is done with really light pellets, that are not accurate at those speeds and lose power fast. so they are not ideal for hunting. so ideal hunting pellets are slower in those guns. although i dont live in ground hog area, i have taken possum and racoon with my benjamin 392 to @ 30yrds with ear shoots and its advertised 685 fps!

I had more fun with Smackdown 2 for the PS1 then I did with the newer SVR games. The big thing that annoys me about the game is the lack of match types. They add in a new match type each year, and remove the old ones (Remember the Casket Match, Buried Alive Match, Fulfill Your Fantasy, Bra and Panties, Lumberjack matches....I could go on forever with the match types that have been removed).    Yet I can't complain to much...I still buy the damn game every year :(|`|5864fJdSaa	i think you are partly right.  svr07 was better then svr06, but when svr08 cam along, it fell straight down to rock bottom. 08 sucked so fricken much! svr09 is pretty good, my favorite in the series followed by 07.|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Both.

gW0nD5cEaa	Despite the fact I was rooting for the Big Red, I would say the Harrison run was great. But Fitzgerald's touchdown was almost as good. If I were a Steelers fan the winning touchdown would have been, but I was not thrilled with it.    It was one of the more exciting games from what I hear.

Seriously, the Steelers had two sets of downs (eight downs) to get a touchdown while inside the FIVE. That pissed me off.

sPiwb8Hraa	The primary reason (imao) is that it is a very disorganized game on the part of the players. I mean, the ball literally just gets lateraled around and people are all sloppy and fans can call in and request a team to run a certain play.    I watch it, but in no way can the game be taken with any seriousness.|`|JbtmCKdTaa	Because it gets no attention from football players|`|GNaj2fudaa	Probably because the superbowl is over and its just a bunch of players from all teams.

75ZMWlnnaa	i think he will never be no.1 again, but the fact is he was no.1 before, and that is an achievement that will be recognised and also the fact that he won us open in 2003, noone can take those two things away from him.    if he keeps playing at the level he is now, i see him sticking around in the top 10 for a while.    as far as majors go, i think the deepest run he can make is QF or SF, he will not get to the final because he would have to beat either rafa or roger in the SF, and i just can not see that happening with the way both those guys are playing right now.    roddick can improve his backhand (it is still weak, stands no chance against rafa or roger), his net game, and stop hitting that spinny forehand, better court positioning (rafa and roger just excel at this) and better court speed.    omg, he needs to watch his wimbledon 04 match against fed where his forehand was hit hard and flat, that was winning him some big points. even though he lost, he played a great match.|`|b1983d97492f54610bd19296241cac96aa	This question have been asked many times before.    The answer will be the same:  He is not good enough to beat the top two players even on their worst day (Fed's mono affected performance not withstanding), and unlikely to beat either the 3rd or 4th ranked player on their average days.  That virtually ensures he will never be in the top again.  I love the fact he works hard and maximizes his potentials, but the game has moved onto something multi-dimensional, Roddick just does not have the tools to compete, 15lbs leaner or not.    The fundamental problem for him is that for him to be able to beat the nadals and feds of the world, he must change his game significantly in some ways, and those changes would make it not Roddick.  As someone closer to 30 than 20, that is just about impossible.|`|9ekjMzbUaa	get more power and volley more.be better with tactics.he can't hit hard with power otherwise he be number one|`|RC3WoqFkaa	he needs to be more consistent, improve his backhand and a ton of other stuff. he won't be  1 in the world any more. nadal is starting to dominate all surfaces. he'll win some big 1 tournaments once in a while, but he won't win a grand slam again.|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	he won that slam and became  1 because he was new and no one knew how he played and now everyone knows how he plays and how to beat him  *EDIT*  hes top 5 material, but considering Nadal, Federer and all these younger players coming, Roddick doesnt have much of a chance to be  1

xOReEw6Waa	Yes, each caliber has it's own specific die set. I reload for 223,243 Win, 30-06 and 300 WSM so I have 4 die sets. Each cartridge requires a different set of sizing and seating dies. Some pistols use 3 dies. In my case the 243 and the 30-06 use the same base, while the 300WSM uses a larger one. The idea is that the same family of cartridges will use the same base---all the 30-06 family use the same base, as does the .308 line.|`|AA12243350	you have to buy a complete "shell plate" for each caliber direct from dillon.  shoot safe|`|itiLu3dRaa	See "caliber conversion kits".
wnyPTH0waa	Umm, for the bridge part, i would suggest doing it on a slant or a matt called a cheese, that basically looks like a triangle of cheese.it helped alot with my back walkover.  also if you practise with someone spotting you, going down into a bridge from standing, it really helps. once youre comfortable with that, you could try doing the kickover part.    the kickover is probably the easier part in the backwalkover because all you have to do is push off your legs really hard for the first few times, then once you get used to the movement, you dont need to push so hard.  i would suggest doing them with someone helping, or spotting you. it helps alot if youre afraid or not used to it.    hope this helps:)  good luck with it:):)
QcNkZxPaaa	2 Teams: Team A and Team B     Each team has 3 separate units: the offense, defense and special units.     Only 11 players are on the field from one team at any one time.    Goal: Score more points that your opponent to win.    A play begins with the snap. From there, the quarterback can either throw the ball, hand it off, or run with it.    Methods of scoring :  TOUCHDOWN = 6 POINTS  EXTRA POINT (after TD) 1 point  TWO-POINT CONVERSION = 2 points (after TD)   FIELD GOAL = 3 POINTS  SAFETY = 2 POINTS    The safety is worth two points.

f1UYyl3Qaa	You want it with all that hang time, thats what makes it a good drop shot. If you watch the pro's hit drop shots, they all have a decent arc to them. This is so it will spin backwards more.|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	I see what you mean, you always come up with lobs for your slices. What you should do is first perfect slicing because a true slice is a ball that floats to the edge of the back court. It's important to master slicing first because drop shot is the same form but with a slightly different follow through.    Once you master the slice you realize that the best slices are those when you cut behind the ball and your stroke starting with the racquet beside your shoulder and ending under and out wards. With that in mind, drop shot is completely different, you want to make the same stroke but with less cut behind the bal and more cut UNDER the ball. It should end up being not a lob, but a falling ball that will land very short and low. The key is to keep the wrist firm and turn your racquet under the ball. That isn't a typical slice since you want it behind it.|`|YKDhstvkaa	put more power in your slice and less in your push.
QTd8MVDjaa	There aren't any "disadvantages" with either barrel. Both barrels will perform better than the stock barrel. They're basically the same barrel. Might as well go with the Progressive barrel, though, because it's only $2 more and it's been around a lot longer, so it's been tweaked a lot over it's production time, so it should perform a little better. They will both do great with the SP-1 and with a good paintball/bore match.

We have had the 2007 and 2008 crf250r's and they have been raced hard and have had no problems with them other than those that you would expect from the punishment given to them.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I've been racing CRF250R's since 2005 and have had no issues. I have the vales adjusted before each season. That is less than recommended but it has worked for me, although I try not to bounce mine off of the rev limiter. If you are not riding super aggressive you could probably get 3 seasons out of the top end. I trade my bikes way before then anyway so I have never needed a top end on the CRF's.
WIsKyL1Maa	The CRF250R is one of the best used bikes on the market. The fist thing i would make sure the bike was easy to start if its hard to start then most likely it has valve issues. The valves on the CRF250 are one of the 1st things to go wrong and costly to repair.     Try to get a one owner that doesn't have much time on it. Check the air filter to see if its clean and has no tears. Check the rear brake pads. Check the tranny oil and clutch side to see if its burnt. This will tell you how well it was taken care of. Good luck!|`|82Esp6v1aa	ask how much its been riden, four-strokes are great bikes, i have a crf250r also and its an 07, i beat the sh it out of it and have replaced valves and pistons since then, so just ask how its been maintained, treated. (even though they will say its never been raced, always maointained, kept inside, blah b;ah blah, you never know what they will say to make a sale haha) but i love four strokes.

I would love to know who put him up to this stunt.    If you thought the double back flip was good, you have not seen anything yet !
AA10959323	The reason is due to water and air's difference in thermodynamic and physical properties. For one, air is much less dense than water, so the same volume of air will heat up much faster than the same volume of water. This means it takes the pool of water longer to heat up than the air above it (meaning for most of the early part of the day it is actually cooler - hence it feels cooler).    Assuming the temperature of the water and the air are actually the same the water still feels cooler due to water having a much higher thermal conductivity. This means that water will pull the heat away from your body at a higher rate than the air will, making it "feel" cooler when it's actually the same temperature.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	As mentioned above, it's mainly heat conductivity. Water conducts heat away from you skin about 20 times more efficiently than air does! This is why SCUBA divers typically wear insulating wet suits even in 70-degree water, while 70-degree air is perfectly comfortable.|`|ZX0ackIraa	water doesn't warm up as fast as the air.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Have you ever been in a hot tub and then jumped in the pool? It feels really cold. Once you get in the water your body has to get used to the water. When it's hot out and you jump into the water, it often feels cooler than it actually is.

We'll see Shaq, Kobe and Jackson back in action on Feb. 15.|`|e244f73e4196f993f5f933b295465ca5aa	No because first Shaq's contract will make the Lakers give up some key player.

F8TvlhYxaa	Francisco had been trying to take out Harrison's knees all game on punt coverage. On the play in question, Harrison blocked the cut block and held Francisco down and hit him with an open palm on the back, then Francisco put his helmet into Harrison's crotch. Harrison let him up and nailed him with an OPEN PALM. It was not a punch, what Harrison did was completely legal. He never punched, he blocked his man out of the play until the whistle blew.    It looked aggressive on replay, but look in the background, the play is still going on and the whistle not blown. Harrison is doing his job and beating down his opponent, legally.    Admittedly the last block may have been after the whistle, but it was borderline at worst. And it's tough to stop yourself as the whistle is being blown. But the flag was already on thrown before the play was over, even though Harrison did nothing wrong during the play. He just physically dominated a inferior opponent who was trying to play dirty. A flag for a late hit might have been appropriate, but unnecessary roughness it was not.|`|4rL3BjkYaa	Ted, thanks for the clip and assessment. It was right on the money.    I think it warranted the flag, mainly to keep future confontations between the two from getting out of hand. Harrison was the aggressor, so naturally he got flagged. Is it worth an ejection and a fine? No way.     Before watching this clip many times, I (as a James harrison fan) thought he should at least get fined. Now it looks to me like it was taken out of the context of the game...the play was still going on, but the media made it look like this defenseless player was laying on the ground taking a beating.    I am sure the official figured it was about time to put an end to it. You can see Francisco clearly going for the chop block, and I can imagine Harrison being frustrated by it. Excessive? Perhaps. But it was handled properly from what i can see.|`|hFmhlcDGaa	You can only see it with stop/action play.  Before Harrison pushed him down you can see Francisco's right arm fly up to Harrison's privates.  It is a fast hit so must be hard, it is only two frames.  I can't show the footage, my wife taped the game on DVR and I watched this in frame by frame mode.    Find someone who has the game saved and watch in stop action and see what you think.    I have to agree with some of the later posts, you can see the Cardinal players in the background downing the ball, that is after the hard push to the ground.  The flags come out because he continued the aggression.  Pushing a player to the ground on a punt seems what the blocker should do.  I thought you call these "pancakes" and are generally praised.   I think if all hard pushes got players ejected you would have this go on all the time.  I can't see why you would eject Harrison for this while almost no other players are ejected and also this action does not come close to a long term injury.  They are hard shoves not knee or back breakers.  Certainly a more serious intent to injure should justify such an outcry.|`|TXq3bLKRaa	Aaron Francisco really did nothing. I watched the movie over and over. Francisco was going into block and slipped a little. Not like he meant to do anything. It's football mistakes happen, so as Francisco went to block Harrison he went a little low, and Harrison took it wrong and started to hit him in the back. Already, Harrison is a poorsport.    Francisco tries to get up, but Harrison (I really don't know why he did it) punched Aaron in the kidney. That was uncalled for. I don't care what you people say.     Over all I know Aaron Francisco is completely innocent.  Harrison acted poorly and had no sportsmanship.    Should of been benched.  My local newspaper said it pretty much. I agree.|`|t6M1iZ3eaa	I don't think Francisco did anything.  But that's the wrong question, because James Harrison acted well within the rules during the play.  Watch the video, and you'll see Harrison does not punch Francisco, no matter what John Madden mistakenly blurted out.  link below:  http://www.pronewsblog.com/sports/james-...  Now, who are you going to believe, John Madden or your own lying eyes?  Watch the clip of what ACTUALLY happened, and you'll see his hand is open the whole time, and he hits him on the upper back, not the kidneys, for crying out loud.  Nothing worthy of ejection or even a personal foul for unsportsmanlike by the time the flag lands behind them.  It looks bad because it's mean, violent and aggressive, but it's all within the rules.    If you don't like this, pick another sport to watch.  Maybe you'd like tennis--an epic men's final in the Australian Open between the two best players in modern tennis history was going on right around the same time.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I don't have a source, but usually when something like this happens, it's trash talk.     Perhaps Francisco was saying something to Harrison that I couldn't type on here without having it get deleted, for example.|`|15wwA3jjaa	He really did nothing to warrant such an attack... about the only thing I can think of him doing is trying to push Harrison away after Harrison punched him... then of course Harrison went ape sh*t on him after such a "brutal" push.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I don't care. Dude got what he deserved.      James Harrison all day baby!|`|hHI0Vktxaa	Harrison has no class at all... he should have been thrown out of the game for those actions, he better get a fine or I'll be a little irritated....    exmelax, Larry Fitz and Steve Breaston were the two that tackled him at the end of the half...|`|MDhI4mBEaa	There is video footage of Francisco trying to hit Harrison in the nuts while he was down. That is why Harrison tried to beat the **** out of him. I would have done the same.|`|AA10848322	I am sure we will get an answer here in the next day or two.? NFL will surely fine Harrison for his misconduct.? As a sports official watching the game, was truly amazed he was not ejected from the game.? Throwing punches is totally unsportsmanlike and unprofessional in a football game.? Upon further review, I am sure Mr. Harrison will lose quite a bit of $$$ for his unprofessional act.? I thought his play at the end of the half was a key play that could of earned him MVP.? But after his disgusting unprofessional conduct, I think it hurt his chances.? I believe if this had been a regular season game, we would see Mr Harrison suspended besides fined.? The Commissioner's Office will probably send down their ruling late this week.  As every game is reviewed for disciplinary action by the front office of the NFL.|`|YkyAozmZaa	francisco was diving fro harrison's legs during the play obviously attempting to injure , i wouldve done more than push him around if you try and ruin my career

AA12103453	Defense admitted they went lax. To be honest though a big part was Ike Taylor falling right about the time Fitz got the pass. I admit in reality that was a lucky break for the Steelers. If they get Fitz right after he catches it I think Warner can still go down and get the TD and the Steelers probably don't have the time to go get the score.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Ok..  What is your question for us?    You answered your own damn question...|`|Jp2415Whaa	The cornerback guarding fitz slipped if you can find the vid on youtube.  As soon as he slipped, it was obvious the gap for one of the best recievers was a one way ticket to the endzone.

It sure woulda been BA if they did that and AZ walked away with a ring.|`|YTasscmKaa	No, they just got burned by a good QB and WR. It happens.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	first it was a stupid defense to have 2 safties 25 yards back. then when the play started the both jus split towards the sidelines leaving a huge gap an poor old harrison had no chance|`|15wwA3jjaa	No, he just burned them and made the  1 defense in the NFL look like a high school team.  Though I will say, if he was smart he would have taken a knee at the 1 yard line to drain as much of the clock as possible.  Had they just run 1 more play that's at least 40 more seconds off the clock, and given the time remaining when Holmes caught that touchdown, the Steelers would have ended up taking the field goal and going into overtime.  Who knows, we might just be talking about the Arizona Cardinals today, and not the Steelers.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	No.    We don't "let" anyone score.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	1.  It's a possibility, but that would be too risky to do.    2.  Fitz has a lot of speed, he could have outran them in any situation.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	No.  He scored because there were 2 out routes and the middle slant worked perfectly.  BTW the  1 ranked Defense gave up 410 yards.|`|VbkKj27jaa	No. The D just got beat. They played good all the way through the 4th i think thats when Warner started to figure out their D just a lil bit.

Before I ordered my RWS 34 Diana, I went to look at a few Gamo rifles at Mills Fleet Farm.  The Gamos there (I can't recall models) but they ranged in price from $150-300, they were all kinda crudely built and looked cheap.  The RWS diana 34 has a much heavier and nicer barrel.  Beyond that, the fit and finish is just as good as most quality firearms.  Plus, the Diana 34 is German made, Gamo is just Chinese garbage.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	If you had said the Gamo CFX then it would have at least been a reasonable comparison, though IMO, the RWS 34 is still a better all around rifle....

mUG8XtNpaa	There were questionable calls for both sides. I find it funny that because of the funny officiating in the last Steelers game, people put emphasis on the officiating for this game.

7zfcYRqwaa	Its a good order, I guess.  The will change the order versus lefty and righties again this year with Victorio batting in a run producing role vs. lefties.  Howard needs some protection because he is a very poor breaking ball hitter and doesn't have any plate discipline, and Werth is not consistent enough to do so, so who know what they are going to do.  My opinion is to switch Howard and Utley, but that wont happen, because you should have your best hitter batting 3rd so he as an opportunity for more at bats in a game.  Maybe move Rollins behind Howard, but that wont happen because Rollins sets the tone for the whole team.|`|mW209Ma3aa	Victorino  Rollins  Utley  Howard  Werth  Feliz  Ibanez  Ruiz  Pitcher|`|klOl7Q6Laa	i think that order is good.

The new KTM RC8R and the HRC prep RC51 ( RVT / VTR )    So really it boils down to budget and what type of bike you want.    You can bike up a cheap, early 90's SuperSport 400 like a Grey Import GSX-R / CRB or even ZXR for as little as 400. Spend @ 100 on making it a track bike, and never look back!

AA11016927	Most attractant company's have a Crappie scent.

It also (call me crazy) seemed to (call me crazy) draw fish from a distance. Once the attractant filtered into the water was when the schools of 'Gils & Crappie showed up.     20 FT from me was another set of guys fishing, (I could hear they were doing well). I immed dropped a live Crappie minnow down once I got set-up and (according to my Aqua View), I had a couple fish pass by, but nothing stayed long enough to get excited about my live bait.      Then I started jigging a SUPER small 1/32 jig (it honestly was a Fly-fishing fly with a split-shot about 2 FT up to weight it down), with added attractant. Within about 10 minutes I had a school of 'Gils & Crappie surrounding my hole! It was amazing- but not unusual! I've had this happen before.     Anyway, the guys fishing next door didn't catch another fish the whole time I was there. I guess I stole there school with my attractant and Fly-jig.................    Hope this helps ya? Good fishing.
EaBRGlLAaa	For the Ray and Tope I would suggest Sandeel, cut off the head thread around the bend of your hook and tie in place with shearing / bait elastic , or trap with the second hook of a pennel rig.    Cod , Lug worm ( my preferance is for black lug ) 4 or 6 threaded up the trace is good, maybe fished as a cocktail with Squid.     Conger , Live or dead fresh Pouting,a whole Mackerel fillet or a whole Squid. The Pouting also gives you a good chance of a nice Bass.|`|26864d65d58271ca44e00e9d7936f50caa	www.whitbyseaanglers.co.uk/best-cod-fish...    i'm just learning too but some of the above looks like it could work. tight lines, JIM|`|xtdeTwYmaa	a spoon|`|tpLEJQhzaa	A fishnet if you have a cano
6S8KjBLQaa	Oh my Lord I love my Elena! I find her squeeling as sexy as can be, and I love her as a player. I was dying for her to win her first major! Wouldn't you be a tad emotional if you were in the semifinals for like 20 majors but have never won a final!? At least she won the gold..She is a very nice person a well.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|KYaM65gzaa	absolutely not. she was my pre tourney pick to win it all i was disappointed when she lost. she is a babe. anyone got her number and can give it to me?|`|75ZMWlnnaa	no way, never would i want to murder her, elena is such a great person on and off the court, and she is not an attention-seeker, she is my favourite female tennis player.    she is a great role model with her great behaviour on and off the court, i guess she kept squealing because she was just frustrated that another great opportunity to get into the final was passing by her so quickly.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I don't mind Elena she's nice and all but i do think she was abit over the top in that game against Serena. It was driving me insane also lol! But other than that i dont mind watching her play|`|uuHrf7cGaa	For god sake she is a professional - squeeks irritate me and I ain't going to murder her even if they are obnoxious.....  As good as a player she is, she has vastly improved on her serves - her ground strokes are far better. Yet she chokes on her serve and irrespective of her looks - many of the Russians seem to choke when they play William sisters. Did we not see Kuznetseva, Sharapova, Damentieva, Safina and you name them - you have chokers when it gets to that level.  I do not like professionals when they grunt and squeek so loud irrespective of their looks. They become monotonous as the game goes on. To top that we have stupid commentators - commenting non sense all the time.....|`|AA11218682	Elena is sexy so she can do whatever she wants
XQoH9ZI5aa	Part of the reason he got the 5 games was because of his lengthy rap sheet.   Yes, I think he deserves to play in the NHL. I also think he deserved the suspension and the loss of pay. The punishment fit the crime. Please, let's not start up with the lifetime bans again.     I'm sure that a ban isn't what you are proposing...is it? LOL He certainly plays with an edge, he's just a marginal player too so not the type of guy you want to see ruining careers but at the same time, we can't get too hasty.     As much as I disliked Bryan Marchment, Ulf Samuelsson, Darius Kaspiritus, Claude Lemieux et al, I wouldn't want their livlihood taken away from them......even for being dirty....suspensions are fine.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	I agree with Bob. You can't be hasty and hand out bans like they're pamphlets. If a ban is ever deserved, it's for players that have a long history of outright nastiness.|`|70ixZ5geaa	Yes.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	He deserves to play if they hand out penalties like this to him whenever he does this kind of stuff, or they increase the amount of time he sits out when he continues to do this.

Lol0iLfgaa	Okay, you probably can do it.  I can't give you a definite answer because I don't know what type of shape you are in.    The best strategy for a 2 miles is to kind of relax into your pace.  Being 14, I am going to assume that the pace will be fast from the gun, and everyone will die off after that point.  The key is for you to not push yourself too hard at the start in order to save more for the end.  Go out with the pack, but stay towards the back.  Try and stay relaxed, and when you feel them falling off, start making your ground.  If you come across at about 6:20 for your first mile, you should be in good shape.  Don't try and go any faster than that though.      You can't win a race in the first mile, but you can lose one.|`|qrHUoUVQaa	you can do it just try hard,  for dinner 2nite eat pasta and tons of water and tomorrow have a power bar and just get a good warm up in take some deep breaths and go for it..... I think you'll do it!  Good Luck... thats the distance I run 1 mile - a half marathon and that is what I do and I made it to nationals, i am 13........:)

If you don't really understand it: Neal down on one knee. And then start to go down to two knees. But while you do this bring your knee that was on the ground first up.
AA10025824	You can't hold things like that against him.  He's just someone who turned out to be a great swimmer.  He wasn't born knowing his life was going to be analyzed and he made mistakes any kid could make.  He would do a service maybe telling kids why they shouldn't do such things now, but we can't hold it against him.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	I don't think he has anything to apologize for.

I don't agree with Michael Phelps allowing someone to take a picture of it, but I certainly don't believe its as big of a deal as everyone is making out to be. Sxe Phil shares the same idea as me and he in the link below.|`|ZtCyxfpfaa	I'm realistic, if this is the worst the young man does, he isn't that bad. I do not idolize or put athletes on pedestals.

6da3ee9b09b2c0e77cd2805c92c4119faa	If you want a good idea of what would be needed, pick up a copy of Into Thin Air by Jonathan Krakauer.  There are plenty of books to read that can take you through what the Everest experience might be like.     Cash is a definite yes - both routes of ascent are thru countries that rely on steeply priced permits as a source of income.  You need guides to keep you out of trouble, sherpas to haul all the necessary equipment and oxygen, and adequate ice climbing experience.  As an example, you need to know how to do a full ice axe arrest, and not just in practice, but you should probably have done one "in combat."      The air is extremely thin.  Before attempting anything like Everest, go summit Whitney, Mt. Rainier, and finally McKinley (aka Denali) to get the experience you'll want prior to making the investment into an Everest summit.    Experience above 14,000 feet will make you a much better candidate for Everest.  Training in lower elevations will help, but it's not enough by a long shot.     The guides that take you on Everest are risking life and limb to get you to the summit and back, and of course, that's something they don't take lightly (either in cash or in their decision on whether they'll take you or not).  The more training and experience at higher altitudes you have, the better your chances of a successful summit attempt.      Cost:  $40,000.00 - $65,000.00 per person    And, from what I understand,...you don't want the "cheapest" guides.  You want the best.  Kind of like having laser eye surgery.  Do you want the cheap guy to do it? or the guy who has done it successfully many many times?   You're trusting the guides and sherpas with your life, so be as prepared as you can possibly be, and hire the best guides to help ensure a safe attempt.|`|Enzrj1hKaa	About $65,000 and a high level of fitness and strength|`|5fSMFUJIaa	well money wise not that much compare to training and physical condition because of your body being able to take that much little air as u get higher to the peak of everest|`|AA10184408	Money, desire, time and training. Thats it!... Oh and, good gloves.|`|yvpfphQNaa	Money, a lot - hundred grand? two hundred grand?    Training - depends on whether you're paying some really experienced Guides a shedload of money to babystep you through every stage, or whether you're doing it as a proper expedition (maybe even with you as the leader). In either case you'll need at least a few seasons in the Alps and/or then other Greater Ranges (probably decades of experience if you do it as a proper expedition) in order to become familiar and comfortable with technique and gear, for rock climbing, ice climbing, and mixed climbing.     Physical condition - you might have to haul a very heavy sack thousands of vertical metres, and you'll have to have very long days. so.. pretty fit!  Note your physical condition affects Not At All the way you react to altitude, sometimes ridiculously fit people can't make it due to that whilst older fatter people can, sometimes the other way around..

gnRiLwSxaa	If you want to play tennis, you must be willing to do some running.   While playing, you will have to sprint for some balls, so you should work on speed, mostly in short sprints.    Toughen up and accept that you may have to do some running in practice and games.   You can't just stand there and look pretty.   Most practice time is practicing certain shots, serving and playing points or practice games.   Some time may be spent doing exercises and running.

Depends on what deck you get.  If you get a blank deck  Its 150 dollars. if you get a pro deck  the highest it ever was, was about 165 dollars. i suggest blank decks if your on a budget. but then again 15 more bucks is pretty worth it|`|99amr13kaa	a local skateshop or look at friends decks and if you like them order them online.|`|lg0g6pH7aa	I wouldnt do zumiez just for a deck its around 60$ i would go on ebay theres like plan b zooyork all brands and a good deck would be zooyork if you want good concave and if you want pop for a good strong ollie it would be a enjoi and you can get trucks everything the whole setup on ebay for aroudn only 60$ suometimes 50$ for EVERYTHING and nothing is different people are just selling them real cheap. remember EBAY.COM unless you wanna go to zumiez and spen almost 200$ for a complete.

zh2OoqVUaa	Yes, they could trade Sun Yue for him.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	The Lakers cant get him, they have no young talent to trade|`|XrCc85kNaa	LMAO!!!  That would be funny as hell...    But no...we cant give up that many players...|`|13XU8cCKaa	Maybe the Grizzlies will give the Lakers Marc like they did Pau last year.|`|KhBmlaefaa	I think a second round pick would be enough to get Marc away from Memphis. I mean all it took was Kwame to get Pau and Kwame isn't even worth a second rounder.|`|PvpbooLXaa	yes they should and I just answered a question asking about a possible trade    http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...

3vJAiAoVaa	the halftime shows have gotten worse and worse since the jt and janet incident. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW HORRIBLE THE HALFTIME SHOW WAS THIS YEAR...THE BOSS WAS A LOSS...THIS was just SAD....POOR GUY...I actually think the highlight was when he got hit in the crotch by the camera...i never laughed so hard...One has to wonder...what was he thinking. Well all swell that ends swell so when his show was over i would consider it a swell ending. LOL|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes. And to make any changes it would take complaining to the NFL from a lot of fans writing letters and sending emails and maybe even putting up a website.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	i agree but i think the super bowl is not what it use to be. AMERICA are going  FOOTBALL that european FOOTBALL. the biggest game in the WORLD. and the name super bowl sound terrible|`|D4Bq1E3Faa	Totally agree on that. Prince was the closest one in the past years to the greatness of the MTV-styled shows. everyone else...no good.  p(-_-)q

1b056ae753a93a6725c73d5d98237d88aa	The Lakers played 32 regular season games with Gasol last season. The won 27 of them. That's an .843 winning percentage, which also happens to be better than any team in the NBA including the Lakers are currently playing. That was done without Bynum, with a Gasol that was completely new to the system and without Trevor Ariza on the floor or Jordan Farmar playing at his current level. Then they made it all the way to the finals! This year's team is better than that team even without Bynum and the rest of the west is not what it was last year. The Lakers will maintain the top seed in the West and return to the Finals. If they are fortunate enough to get Bynum back great, if not, don't worry so much. I like this teams chances.|`|1X8c2hEFaa	well theres actually a chance thats going to happen. its a torn MCL and that really a bad injury so he might be out including the playoff, which sad for the lakers, i hope he comes back before the playoffs.  I dont think lakers will make any deal, they are pretty decent team now.|`|tnqO91xoaa	Bynum will be back in time to give the Celtics an a$$ wooping|`|EKF2HdZKaa	if they do their chemistry is on the line........  personnally they arent bad with bynum out,so they should stick with no trades,plus lamar odom should be able to step up|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Bynum will be out 8-10 weeks so he will have about a month to redeem himself and rehab his basketball skills to get ready for the playoffs. He is a possible franchise player for the Lakers Jackson would make a stupid move trading him, because then they will have to move Gasol to the center position, and we all know the softness Gasol has, he will get scared to death facing Shaq and other big centers, especially Shaq lol.|`|yL894Gj3aa	Who do they got to trade besides Gasoft and Odom?
VjMpfA2Yaa	Yes he is a great goolie and a bright future...but he should be out there already.     Put it this way in America he cant get any better, he has reached his max, until he goes to europe then he will be better. Lets just look at the example the US did, Brad Guzan is a great goolie, has a great future, 3 years in the MLS and now he is in Aston Villa. He might not be a starter but he is devoloping his skills...I think thats something Mexican teams need to start doing.    And america needs to get him of his lil cloud fast!|`|sp80uzmLaa	Yes to Manchester United|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Yeah he probably will|`|smeaQXafaa	Yes  Most likely he will go to EPL  Manchester United mostly because Van der Sar is 38 or something and they will be looking for a goalie to replace him soon.|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	Yeah talented he well leave in 2010 and Probably go to Barca, for some reason i picture him there. its probably because Valdez sucks hella bad|`|mdEqS1JXaa	i think he will he said that he is just waitting for 2010 so he can play the world cup i think that arsenal will end up buying him|`|A2puqgbTaa	Yah  He and America said he was going to leave to europe after this season    Uh Barca cuz they need a goalie|`|8zgFyfibaa	Yes and america is a great club. So what you're saying is the mexican league is weak?......    A lot of manchester united fans have said that they like his style and would love for him to be they're goalkeeper after van de sarr.    But I think clubs like this would be good for him.    Newcastle united aka TOON ARMY  Ac milan  Fc porto  Manchester united  Ajax amsterdam.|`|7DwKjkMWaa	OK the only reason you think AMERICA is not for MEMO is cus  your jealous he inst with that LAME EXCUSE of a TEAM u SUPPORT.. that being said....    YES MEMO WILL BE GOING TO EUROPE BUT NOT TOO SOON MAYBE AFTER THE WORLD CUP. AND ACTUALLY MANCHESTER UNITED ARE LOOKING TO REPLACE VAN DER SAR, AND THEY LIKE HOW HE PLAYS SO WHO KNOWS. HE MIGHT JUST JOIN THE RED DEVILS.    BUT SEEING AS HOW MANCHESTER CITY IS THROWING RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR GREAT PLAYERS I SEE HIM GOING TO MAN CITY.    AS FOR BARCA, NOPE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN VICTOR VALDEZ  HAS HIS SPOT SECURE, TALK ABOUT THEY NEED A GOALIE HE IS THE LESS SCORED ON GOALIE IN LA LIGA RIGHT NOW, ALLOWING ONLY 15 GOALS IN 21 GAMES, SO ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, UNLESS HE WANTS TO BE IN THE BENCH FOR A YEAR OR 2 WHICH I DOUBT.    AS FOR ARSENAL IF U HAVEN'T NOTICED ARSENAL DOESN'T BUY PLAYERS THEY MAKE PLAYERS SO HE WONT GO THERE.    MILAN? MAYBE, BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT THEY WILL OUT BID MANCHESTER UNITED OR MANCHESTER CITY.  SO ITS EITHER ONE OF THOSE TWO CLUBS.    BUT HE WILL BE GOING TO THE ELP MOST CERTAINLY.|`|c6H2GC9kaa	yea he will go soon and if he does it would be to either man utd, arsenal or ac milan bcuz they all have old goalies in their starting line ups|`|1fwo8HqMaa	european clubs don't like 5'11' tall goalies.    he is too short!    the average goalies out there are about 6'3' and up.    he is not made for euro footy.|`|b4uCTRABaa	ii think he will leave when he is champion with america but he has to stay there for a long time|`|gPQLOPFDaa	YEA HE IS A GREAT GOALIE THATS WHY HE IS THE BEST GOALIE IN MEXICO ANY TEAM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HIM AND HIS FUTURE IS IN EUROPE HE IS GOOD AND TALENTED|`|C3RCunFoaa	Darko hahah he is not 5'11"    Guillermo Ochoa-  1.83m - 6'0"    Iker Casillas-   1.85m - 6'1/2"    last time i checked Iker Casillas and Ochoa are one of the best Goal Keepers in the world, and him and Ochoa are almost exactly the same height|`|p4cgonKCaa	manchester united most likely their current goalie is getting old and they are going to have to replace him soon.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Most likely

However, the Cardinals have never won a Super Bowl, so I can understand their fans' frustration.    I'm not justifying it, just saying I understand it.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	The losing teams bandwagon fans always whines about the refs. The true fans know that their team screwed up, not the refs (at least most of the time).

He was going for a throw and it was an incomplete pass.|`|AA11650395	What do you mean by always? Have you really paid attention to them even before this football season?

Ar5VHDiBaa	ACTUALLY people from all the main ball & stick sports in America go to a Disney Park w/ the trophy after winning the championship.    The phrases "I'm Going to Disneyworld!" and "I'm Going to Disneyland!" were a part of Disney's advertising campaign in the late 1980's.    The week before Super Bowl XXI in 1987, New York Giants quarterback, Phil Simms was approached by Disney reps and asked if his team won the Super Bowl if he'd say "I'm going to Disney World!" while they had a camera on him.    At first Phil Simms declined but the Disney reps persisted and on January 25, 1987 after his New York Giants defeated the Denver Broncos, 3920, Phil Simms became the first person to utter the words "I'm Going to Disneyworld!"|`|gjWgIs10aa	cuz they go to disney land|`|eh33yd3Kaa	Every year after the SuperBowl the MVP (usually on the winning team) says "I'm going to Disney World!" and does.     Springsteen was just joking around with the saying, I'm not sure if he actually meant it. >.|`|UADHt07Zaa	First, I'm pretty sure that he said, "I'm going to Disney World."    Second, Disney has this thing with at the NFL where the Super Bowl MVP yells to a camera, "I'm going to Disney World," and has sort of become a post-Super Bowl tradition, where he actually goes to Disney World.    I remember in 2006 when the Steelers beat the Seahawks.  One of the Steelers yelled out a variation of it, saying, "I'm taking the Bus to Disney World," refering to Jarome 'the Bus' Bettis, not an actual bus.    Heckler: I thought it was like that but I wasn't sure.|`|AA12220784	Well they give the MVP a car and send them to disney.  but I am hoping Holmes run Springsteen over with that car.|`|Sw0yxyueaa	yeah, what a Dumbo.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	yeah somebody said it. Maybe he got paid to say it.
V1Ods7dvaa	The Cardinals won two challenges. I hear ya, it isn't fair.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	yes, take away the Seattle Super Bowl too. If you can believe it, that was actually WORSE then this one!  Ill even go as far to say that Pittsburgh IS better then AZ, but wow, they were handed that one|`|c71316f440c7c102ff8ab9c606b89e49aa	sour grapes|`|cdQryr7paa	OMG.  Warner's hand was going forward, but the ball was not in it, and under control of it.  Harrison was not down at the one, because he was on top of a Cardinal player, so he was not in contact with the ground.   Holmes made a heck of a catch, and his toe was down.  Maybe you should ask yourself why Warner threw that ball into coverage right before the half so it was intercepted anyway, instead of whining about Harrison's knee.  Or, how the Cardinals let Holmes get open in the opposite corner of the end zone running the same play he had the ball go right through his hands on the play before.  You and your buddies need to quit whining like little girls about the Cardinals losing.  You all look pathetic.|`|FPjIOlSAaa	O please dont be such a soor loser(i rooted for the cardinals to win)    it wasnt a clean game there were flags flyinging everywhere for both teams. there was only one questionable call. No one played clean football. one guy on the cardinals was called for holding like 20 times. the officials officiated the game the right way.   The cardinals had a better offense then the steelers. Cardinals did better overall on offense than the steelers, but the carinals defense were running out of gas and the steelers offense got to the cards D        This is what happened to the NFL  it was a good game stop complaining  officials did a good job and every call was good except one questionable one  u dont hear any of the players or coaches complaining or any commentators.|`|98bupiDFaa	I'm not a Steelers or Cards fan, but...shut up.  People like you annoy the hell out of me.|`|JWu1exdQaa	i totally agree with you    but  im a girl and i know football    sexist jerk    i take that back thanks!|`|6VsjiOWKaa	They shouldn't invalidate the Super Bowl. Sure the refs did make some pretty bad calls, but Sanantonio Holmes did get both feet in bounds.And Harrison got that ball across the goal line. But the thing that bothers me is that the refs didn't at least review Kurt Warner's "Fumble". The play was questionable but the refs couldn't take the time to review a call that decided if the game would keep going?|`|VkwL0vooaa	Holmes toe was down and Harrison was in but it was close. Fitzgerald's TD was not a catch but ref had some horrible calls against the Cardinals. I was rooting for the Cardinals but the only thing that really could have changed the game for them was more penalties on the Steelers and one last shot at the end zone because Warner did not fumble it.|`|Xov7QY2faa	Yeah the game really annoyed me, I couldn't even watch it for the first time in years.  They called the Cardinals on everything, but the Stealers deserved some calls that they didn't get.  One guy touched the football to the ground before he made it to the endzone, and they didn't call it.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes...  The steelers only won because of the refs and steroids (back then)...|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Warner's fumble at the end of the game WAS reviewed by the booth. They ruled it a fumble!!!!

There is nothing to review, the game is over, move on with your life!!!|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Holmes had both feet down ,They showed the replay 20 times.If you want to know why they lost look at the pick that went for the TD before the half.That's where the Cards lost.It was game over right their    I'm not a Steelers fan.|`|r61bHJ0iaa	UGH...I'm so sick of hearing the sorry a$$ cardinals fans saying the STEELERS stole the superbowl from them.

I support Sven, and I really really hopes he beats the US and continues as the coach cause too many changes in a team is whats phucking up the seleccion.    BUT i heard that Sven was one of the top candidates to manage Real Madrid! and that he was in talks with los galacticos but rejected the offer because he respected the contract he had with Mexico (says alot of Sven)     But also, Aguirre said that when he left Atletico he would love to coach in the EPL...will that happend now? or will he just take a break and find another coaching job out there in Europe.    id Mexico has a dissapointing loss against the US (hope not) I think might even resign, cause Mexico casi se lo va tragar if that happends, but like I said I hope Sven stays and does his thing, he is a great coach and hopefully we start seeing results.....    Vamos Mexico!!|`|PowkYTGJaa	Dude I dont think thats gonna happen but c'mon people we have to support our coach hes really experience I think he knows perfectly whats hes doing and sven is gonna take us to the world cup no doubt!!

MPz9APZDaa	Great game, that's what great players do when they are missing a key player. Don't forget Gasol had a great game with 31 pts 5 ast 14 reb. But yeah, a great game from number 24...!|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	what mark said :]|`|aUGM3ju6aa	What a STUPID record? It's just a freakin 61 point game. Who cares where it was at? Jordan scored 61 plenty of times.|`|D6Llh23Baa	well, LAL is right. it was bernard's king 60 points made in MSG that was the previous record. jordan's 55 was the highest in MSG by any non-knicks player.|`|jjjgcuduaa	It's not Jordan, it's Bernard King's record.|`|MTbgg5eyaa	61 points. 3 healthy fingers.
3cQx8ZFSaa	Lita as she's had a great career and has been in some great storylines as well.|`|YRkjw7kDaa	Trish...maybe not her mic skills but the rest  Lita and Gail Kim would probably be a little behind her at least in my opinion|`|qCt3yUNlaa	Trish Stratus|`|7UcaXCHraa	me of course! :D|`|74s2ddGMaa	as much as people don't like her cause of what she did after wrestling i think chyna is just cause she was so brutally dominant...plus she fully got the short end of the stick when it came to the whole triple h/steph mcmahon thing...sickest move?...widows peak by victoria|`|cE8SQUEbaa	Lita.|`|af8360bee6f5cbac42cfcedb7980ccc4aa	Trish Stratus no question she has it all.|`|ysa5YgZcaa	Lita no doubt|`|6n63DKYWaa	well if you include title reigns then it is the fabulous moolah|`|MBTxmuNpaa	Chyna who is the only diva to participate in the Royal Rumble and she is the only diva to be Intercontinental Champion which is why she is the best

Not sure, best bet would be shaq or t-mac.|`|p4H61jQDaa	if bosh bolts raps should try and get a player like D wade or joe johnson, i really would want bosh to stay as he would make a formidable duo with banana in the front court but it sadly looks like it is not going to happen, I would try and trade bosh for greg oden|`|h1xvACAnaa	agree with =DD the Knicks will most likely get Bosh and either Lebron (which seems really unlikely right now) or D-Wade and the Knicks in return i think will get Nate Robinson and some other players and a frist round draft pick rights
f239486529db7d21a3e718cc9dd9fedfaa	They need to play better defense. Opponents are scoring at will against them. Its mostly the fault of Mike Dantoni he wants to play a fast paced scoring game. We all know defense wins championships. Mike Dantoni has been able to win but not win when it matters. A trade would also help a player like tayshaun prince or Varejao are those players who do the dirty work eveynight. New york doesnt have a player like that. the future is bright with nate robinson and david lee|`|gDkAsUGKaa	hahahaha what wuld u be saying with bynum too in the line-up lol welcome to the thunder level. soory bud.       and jesus!!!! 59 points wtf|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Say good night now.

PvIFahGjaa	Train your calves, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Do squats, leg extensions, toe raises for calves - hold dumbells or a barbell with weights at your side or in front of you and raise your toes off the ground using your calves. Hamstring curls, leg press, and lunges with dumbells.      Deep Knee Bends --- Be standing. Slowly bend at the knees while keeping your back straight. Slowly crouch down as low as possible (it shouldn't hurt) and slowly rise back up. Do this 15 times. Over time increase to 20, 30, etc.     Deep Knee Bend Jumps --- Be standing. Crouch down as described above but fairly quickly, almost touching your bottom to the ground, then explode upwards as high as you can. The moment you land, immediately crouch and launch back up again. Do this 15 times, and when you can, increase to 20, 30, etc.     Toe Raises --- Stand regularly, then raise up onto the tips of your toes. Lower back down. Don't just rock up and down, do it slowly (not too slowly) but steadily. Repeat 30-50 times.     Toe-Raise with Weights --- If you have any sort of weights, holding/wearing them while doing these toe raises will help. Use small weights (a mere 5 or 10 pounds is fine) and work your way up.     Stomach Crunches ---  Stomach crunches, where while lying on your back, using your ab muscles and keeping your back straight, you rise up just enough to lift your shoulders off the ground, are better. Do them often - perhaps for 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night.     Jumping Rope - Jumping rope definitely helps your vertical leap. Jump rope while watching tv or something. Make it a habit.     Also do plyometric exercises. Plyometric exercises are specialized, high intensity training techniques used to develop athletic power (strength and speed). Plyometric training involves high-intensity, explosive muscular contractions that invoke the stretch reflex (stretching the muscle before it contracts so that it contracts with greater force). The most common plyometric exercises include hops, jumps and bounding movements. One popular plyometric exercise is jumping off a box and rebounding off the floor and onto another, higher box. These exercises typically increase speed and strength and build power.     Look up some plyometric exercises on Google.|`|VHphDgrhaa	hamstrings are most important. tie heavy stuff to your legs/feet then try to jump.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	work out or do jumps with a weight vest or weights around your ankles. then when you take them off it will be easier to achieve your goal

LyR6DudNaa	the way to get better is to watch the pros play(NBA)  watch what they do, study the  moves. Then after that start applying it to pratice.Run the move over and over again.

It works great.  Playing against better players will be another good way to improve.|`|AA10305521	practice. go to training lessons. watch films to see what you need to work on. go to your public library and rent some movies about basketball with john stockton dribbling drills and types of things like that.|`|FsnxfhEuaa	OK, I have some Things that will Totally HELP you. If you are desperate, Use these things.    1. Practice, at anytime you're not doing anything, Go out the door, go shoot some hoops at your park.      2. Try Watching On Youtube, Videos like The Top  Basketball Things you need to know.      3. If you could Join your schools' Basketball team, That would be Magnificent. The Coach Will really help you practice, then you'll get a little playing time in the real games.                   Good Luck, Wish you the best of it. Hope You Win The Tournament.

UWJinEbIaa	-from ROH home page    "The first TV tapings for Ring of Honor on HDNet will take place on Saturday, February 28th at 7:30pm and Sunday, March 1st at 3:00pm. History will be made when ROH holds its first two television tapings. Both events will take place at The Arena (formerly the New Alhambra Arena or ECW Arena) on 7 Ritner Street, Philadelphia, PA 19148.    Tickets for the February 28th sale are now on sale at www.rohwrestling.com. The on sale date for tickets to the March 1st event will be announced shortly."    Its a good channel for them considering that it is a small company.....they don't have to worry about "ratings" or pleasing "fanboys".   I can see ROH gaining new fans who regularly watch HD Fights and its specials.

I am a Lakers fan and haven't been a fan of Kobe's until the last few weks of this season when he's played basketball - not that me-first, I'm-going-to-score-no-matter-what mentality that he's displayed since entering the league.    And "championship in the bag"? Not that I wish it, but how about this scenario: Kobe drives the lane during a playoff game and someone steps in trying to draw a charge and Kobe takes a hard fall and breaks a bone, has a concussion, etc. Who cares whether it's a charging foul or a blocking foul? Kobe will be out at a critical time. Don't think it's possible? Ask Steve Nash about this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM0ndgMMV...|`|XrCc85kNaa	No..

MTbgg5eyaa	Dude, Reggie Miller probably is the next best shooting guard after Jordan in their era.    If you would base it on the rings, you seriously need to get a life.    I mean, John Stockton and Karl Malone is better than Robert Horry. And they have no rings compared to Horry's seven.    Ray Allen is not the greatest 3-point shooter. reggie is.    HOF is not based on being in the All-Star, it's based on a percentage of fan base.    Dude you don't even know what it takes to be a HOF, so please, don't post stuffs like this.          EDIT : What i mean is All-star is based on fan votes.    Yao Ming is averaging over 2 million votes but he doesn't even deserve to be in the HOF.    Me retarded? Dude, you better check out my credibility. Let's see who's who. You've not even been in here for long. And the fact that you're stating dumb facts on being a HOF just makes your opinions worse.|`|7a0dbc5c9e3cb71bdf921f4ec25ba243aa	Yes definitely. here are some of the reasons why  1.Miller is the all-time NBA leader in total 3-point field goal made (2,560) and ranks at 12th place in total points (25,279),[1] 7th in free throw percentage (88.8%), 6th in minutes played (47,619) and 7th in games played (1,323).[1] He is also all-time NBA leader in total three-point field goals made in the playoffs (320).  2.Miller led the league twice in three-point field goals made (1992-93, 1996-97). He also led the league in free throw percentage five times, including his last season.  3.Reggie Miller is one of only six members of the 50-40-90 club along with Larry Bird, Mark Price, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki and Jos Caldern. This club is for players who during the course of a season shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better from three-point range, and 90% or better from the free throw line.  4.Miller played more games with the same team than all but two players in NBA history, John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz. Over the course of his career, Miller scored 25,279 points, with an average of 18.2 points per game. He shot .471 from the field, .395 from 3-point range and .888 from the free throw line  5.Miller was a member of the gold medal-winning Olympic men's basketball team in 1996 and of the US national team for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and 2002 FIBA World Championship. The 2002 team did not win the championship that year, which was the first time that NBA players competed against international competition and lost. Miller was injured during the 2002 World Championships and played limited minutes.  These reasons alone are good enough to get him in the hall. It doesn't matter that he hasn't won a ring. Barkley ha no rings. Also Miller would beat Allen|`|fHxpycJSaa	He will be elected easily when his time comes.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No,he hasn't got great nubers and he's one of the top five shooters in the nba as third behind Allen and Allen is behind Nowitzki who is the best all time shooter.But Miller NO WAY man  Dirk would win them both on a shotout|`|i0Igqvroaa	of course, because its MILLER TIME! i agree with matt theres not a lot of reggie millers in the nba. i mean this guy was booed by pacer fans when he first came in the league but look at what happened after that. he stayed with one team for his whole career, and has led the team to many playoffs trips and the finals even if they lost. he was one of those unique, charismatic, fun, likable  guys thats hard to find these days in the nba oh yeah hes super clutch|`|1238d8d31da2946a8a5f08dd1fdb4bcbaa	YES.Miller caused terror for many NBA teams.    Reggie Miller would win.heck,Reggie Miller in 2009 would beat Allen|`|xGLyp2TOaa	Miller is the all-time NBA leader in total 3-point field goal made (2,560) and ranks at 12th place in total points (25,279),[1] 7th in free throw percentage (88.8%), 6th in minutes played (47,619) and 7th in games played (1,323).[1] He is also all-time NBA leader in total three-point field goals made in the playoffs (320).    Miller led the league twice in three-point field goals made (1992-93, 1996-97). He also led the league in free throw percentage five times, including his last season.

This club is for players who during the course of a season shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better from three-point range, and 90% or better from the free throw line.     He is a hall of famer, and no there are not plenty of reggie millers in the NBA|`|IZ3tNmpyaa	Definitely a Hall of Famer. Not only was Reggie Miller a great shooter he was also one of the Most CLUTCH SHOOTERS in the history of the league. Where do you think MILLER TIME came from? He was at his best when the game is on the line.. He never choked.. If there was one guy you dont want holding the ball if you were playing the Pacers in the  dying seconds of the game with you up by 2 points its Reggie Miller.. Jordan, Ewing, Malone and all those great players from the late 80s to the late 90s can attest to that.     MILLER TIME is an HOF no doubt.|`|gnRiLwSxaa	No.   There are dozens of players as good as Reggie.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Yeah, Reggie would win if he was in his prime.
EKF2HdZKaa	im goin with rudy gay to win......  fernandez cant dunk (other than alley oops)  dwight wont repeat....  nate....agreed|`|13XU8cCKaa	No.  Putting in a little midget makes it exciting.

Z0AE7eHiaa	Uconn is looking good against my cards right now, they have taken away our inside game completely. Most teams can't do that.

It's either a all MX team or all American team, no mixing.|`|wKnjGSU1aa	If there was ever a team like that, this would be a very good line-up in my opinion:    ____________Ochoa  Bornstein, Marquez, Bocanegra, Salcido  _________Pardo___Bradley  Dempsey__________________Guardado  ___________Castillo  ___________Donovan    Subs:  GK: T.Howard, O.Sanchez  DF: J.Magallon, O.Onyewu, R.Osorio,   MF: F.Arce, G.Torrado, S.Kljestan, G.Dos Santos, D.Beasley  FW: O.Bravo, J.Altidore    Overall, I would pick Osorio over Bornstein, Magallon over Bocanegra, Arce over Dempsey, but then it would basically be Mexico, your question is about a mixed team, this would be what I would use.|`|smeaQXafaa	If that was to happen then I would go to a gas station with my car and crash right into the gas pumping thing and kill myself and everybody there.|`|EGEafwSVaa	----------------------Ochoa-----------.....  ---------------------Howard-----------...  -------------------O.Sanchez----------...

PvpbooLXaa	I like that trade as it helps all sides and fills all teams needs and is quite fair|`|eec2ef335496c1fc74f9ca2966ab4363aa	pretty good overall but im guessing lee wont agree to that low of a contract when his current one expires....so philly kinda of gets screwed.
EKF2HdZKaa	as much as i dislike this trade..........  i think it is a pretty decent trade  charlotte can morph the players they recieve (especially darko) to be usefull  memphis gets a good big and some exp.  sacr. gets a good pg who should help the whole team out well  lakers get another big man.......|`|ObwyyJuMaa	If i was the lakers i would try for Brad Miller|`|I7fZPAkOaa	this is horrible. tell me why the bobcats would get rid of Felton and Morrison for  Luke Walton and Darko?!?!? Felton has great potential and is worth much better players than those 2 jokes. come on now...|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Its not bad, its a pretty good trade. That will be cool both gasol brothers on 1 team. I want to see that!|`|PvpbooLXaa	I think the trade is worth it for all the teams but the Bobcats. I could see why Larry Brown would want the two but I just don't see it happening unless you add a first round pick to the Charlotte from the lakers
k6Sbm9qCaa	YEAH... i am actually in peru right now... the waves here have been really small for about a week but a swell is coming... anyway there are killer waves here... There are many spots to surf my personal favorite is Mancora... nice left point break..  the town is amazing... super low key and lazy during the day..... but at night its a whole different story it is full of nite life and lots of partying. It is very safe area just dont go looking for trouble you know what i mean.  everything here is very very cheap!  email me at surferjoshcr@yahoo.com if you want to talk more...  peru is a very beautiful country and the econmy is booming compred to the states that is why i am here.  this place is amazing! hope to hear more from you.  later|`|4veNeNU6aa	anywhere in the northern area is gonna catch some really solid swell.  I mean like the Mancora/Lobitos region.  Or, you could try your luck in central Peru, around Chiclayo.  Lots of good lefthanders down there! Have fun!
Da3Rvlfoaa	Dmitri is correct...    But real men use CO2!    And then go to the hospital to have the pot-metal slide removed from their chest, after it sheers off and impales them...    ...ya, propane+silicon oil+adaptor nozzle for propane tank=green gas|`|bfe155c991aa2ee2da9869b79c9d2198aa	yes u can. all u need is 1 of those small propane tanks from walmart or any other store for like $3 and a propane adapter (kinda pricy but its worth it in the long run) the only bad thing really is that it flippin stinks! oh and propane and green gas dont last long in the cold so in the winter i would use a co2 pistol or get a co2 mag for my gas gun.  and lastly u need some silicone oil that u put in the orings of the prpoane tank so ur gun doesnt break. hope i at least helped ya!|`|UuknG7bJaa	Everyone said it, but yeah, get a propane adapter and some silicone lube. Put some lube in it about every 5 magazine fills and you'll be good.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	Green gas = propane + silicon oil.|`|HAH7ILrSaa	yup, don''t forget to buy some propane adaptors and some sillicone or it won't work.    CO2 guns are uncommon but they preform better at cold temp and a stronger fps.
1jmXT4Vvaa	I was looking into the condor until I heard several complaints of the front stock falling off during recoil.  I've also heard complaints of the trigger having problems.  It has the single trigger, and sometimes it won't advance to the second barrel with light loads, and sometimes it fires both barrels at once with heavy ones.  It is not Benelli quality.  That's like saying the Aveo and the Corvette are the same because Chevy makes both.  One is a cheap Korean import and the other is a Vette.  I would ask to shoot a few boxes of shells through it.  Use some low brass target loads as well as some three inch slugs.  If you are satisfied after 100 rounds, buy it.  If he doesn't agree, I'd pass.  I ignored warnings about the quality of the new Kahr semi auto Tommy guns.  The result, I sent it back to the factory for the second time today.  It sucks.  I spent $900 on a Tommy gun that won't shoot a full clip without jamming at least twice (now the clips are just falling out during recoil).  There's usually something to the complaints, especially if the same complaint shows up a few times.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	If you give the seller 1/2 of what he paid for it, it would probably be a good deal for both of you.    BTW, The first time a friend of mine saw a Stoeger Outback, he asked the clerk "where's the rest of this gun?". LOL.    Edit: yes, I know Stoeger is owned by Benelli. But if the Stoeger 2000 is the same as the Benelli, why does the benelli cost a couple of hundred dollars more?|`|wtpbA43aaa	stogers are not the best quality, Iwould pay about $200

ZEP1K3oSaa	Hell yes I was born in 1971 an grew up with the Iron Curtain, with Mean Joe Green, Terry Bradshaw and Frank O Harris, which many people mistake me for him a lot! Anyway I have been a fan from the cradle to the grave I'm 37 now and I am looking forward to being a Steelers Fan for life! 6 Baby babbbbbayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!! I love it and just so you all know I was born and raised her in Riverside California so I'm not from there and was never a Rams, Raiders or Chargers fan so I've never been a turn coat and thank god I never like Raiders or Rams since they both suck and are turn coats period...all those of you who are fans of them need to think for one second if those franchises were for the fans why did they turn! F-them!!! Great topic and I love love love that we are the Champions for the 6th time and only one in history and first! Best of luck to all of you next year! I predict Phili and Pits next year should have happened this time but oh well, next year (Eric) he's my best friend and obviously an eagles fan!    GAH|`|m4wFJPAOaa	You mean the way they bought the game??|`|8h3tSUYuaa	No I hate them. I'm not even a Cardinals fan but they should of won.|`|CFsBX9Nxaa	Yeah i just watched the game cause it is the superbowl! i didnt like either team but i was hoping the Cards would win. O well my team will be in it Next year!!    How Bout them COWBOYS!!|`|pVHOTFfjaa	NOPE!I HATE THE STEELERS!CARDINALS SHOULDVE WON THAT GAME!AND AGAIN I HATE STEELERS!!!!|`|ufr8TU6Jaa	Hell yes!!! They are a great team and have done well especially to have a new coach. The game wasn't bought, both teams put in great effort and it just so happend that the steelers were a little bit better. It was a great game!! GO STEELERS 6 time FRANCHISE CHAMPS!!!! WOOOT!|`|C2CCbTRKaa	YOUR OFFICIALLY CRAZY RIGHT NOW!!!|`|AeYeR5KQaa	football sucks|`|Lc17QNBmaa	NO WAY!!!! I sooooooo wanted the cardinals to win!|`|f4161d5311428bd1bcf66cba4e105e28aa	No. I hate the Steelers.|`|AA12220784	I am a longtime Steel fan right out of Sixburgh.  Very happy .  Who Day? Steelers!|`|ruenEu8Yaa	i wanted to see the cardinals win.  especially after that comeback they made... being a big colts fan i wanted to see edgerrin james get him a SB ring and i wanted to see kurt warner get his "hall of fame sealing super bowl win"    im not upset though.  it was nice to see the steelers get their 2nd SB win and 6th overall.  i like big ben, and i like most of their coach.  so im content with the outcome, even though that last play should have been reviewed.  even though it was obvious it was a fumble...
sPiwb8Hraa	Anyone who did malicious destructive damage should be held responsible for their actions. Stopping the Super Bowls is insane. That would be like telling the World Cup people that they have to stop soccer for the same reason.|`|RZIV15e3aa	They should be arrested. No because the Eagles have a title to win next year.
KR3IvxNwaa	that would be a good deal. Cardinals defnitely need a good running back to back their passing game and Chargers also need a great WR.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Wow are you serious? AJ Smith won't pull the trigger and the Cardinals won't either.|`|4pL0fjeVaa	No chance, Fitzgerald isn't going anywhere.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Why  the heck would ARizona make that trade?|`|KTp27Fokaa	Not a chance.    Fitz has many more years ahead of him than LT, and is better than him right now.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!! we need fitz to stay and bring us back to the big game|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	lmaoo yeah!!!!! id do tht for sure!!!!!!!! rivers would have a new target and san diego would win!    but i wouldnt take the deal if i was the cards|`|FmZyN6ORaa	Fitzgerald is the Cardinal's star receiver right now...I doubt they would trade him|`|37PYnKr9aa	What reason would the Cardinal make a trade like that? LT is great, but Fitzgerald is younger and is not a RB. WR's last a lot longer than RB's. LT should have some great years left, but due to the Chargers over using him the past 8 years, he is not the same back he used to be.|`|yg3Pveakaa	What the f... Will you trade the present star for the fast? Hell NO!!!|`|M5ykrN4Laa	that would be retarded fitzgerald in aa chargers jersey? NOPE!|`|uoZIYhJtaa	No way Arizona takes this trade (The Chargers would take it in a minute)...LT has a lot of miles on him and he has seen his best days.|`|ySjHowZqaa	The cards aren't stupid they know that they've got the best reciever in the nfl They wouldn't trade him.|`|btcbtyDnaa	no lt isnt on a roll now, and fitz needs to bring us the big trophy|`|5etFAmrsaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|rzkFHAEJaa	no.
K7JfRjzMaa	Hell yes. Kane has busted his *** for 12 years in the WWE. I think it's ridiculous that a guy like him only has one world championship (ECW title doesn't count, imo) for one day, while a guy like Edge has had SEVEN World/WWE title reigns over 4 years. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching Edge, I love the character, but I am tired of Edge as WWE Champion.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	IMO he doesn't need the title. He likes doing good business and putting over talent. His prime was 5 - 10 years ago.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Kane doesn't want the title. In his WWE spotlight interview Kane is more interested in promoting the younger talent. Kane is a class guy, who puts the business ahead of personal gain.|`|mtuXPcAnaa	You're not the only one.

oMjVp4zGaa	if your boat is a tiller model and your trolling motor is not a foot pedal model then you have to put in on the transom where you will be 90% of the time though you have a huge disadvantage with steering it from the transom your need to be centralized in all aspects will out weigh running from the back to the front endlessly when you should be fishing    If your boat has a steering wheel then you might have to return your trolling motor and get the longer shaft model for that bow mounting perfection it offers, even if it is a hand operated or a foot pedal operated.     If you need any other help, please include all the possible variables that will assist in our helping you.|`|NaFP8RaLaa	Trolling motors can steer and control the boat better if mounted up on the bow.  Also makes it easier to control if you are up on the front casting.  Myself, if the only time I would mount a trolling motor on the back would be if it was on a small jon boat and it was the main motor on a river, lake, or pond.|`|amlmhoUuaa	Generally they are mounted on the front of the boat. So they are easier to maneuver while you are fishing as for you fixing the height issue they make trolling motors that have a longer poles.  I would check at Bass Pro Shop  to see if they make an extension or something.  Hope I helped good luck and enjoy you new boat|`|nfCH7nkTaa	You should always put it on the front of your boat, you can change the height of it by changing the stopper on it, I have to do it all the time when the lake gets rough

You can also direct order bullets from the manufacturers, such as Barnes,Nosler,Hornady, Sierra, Swift and Speer. I just hate to spend money on shipping if you could have someone local.

XNpnK4vpaa	Mildots are not the same thing as Minutes of Angle (M.O.A.).    An m.o.a. is the measurement of an angle.  It is 1/60th of a degree.  There are 360 degrees in a circle.    Often people express it as one inch at 100 yards.  What they mean is that the one m.o.a. could create a triangle (or a cone) whose sides are 100 yards long and whose base measures approximately 1 inch wide (or in diameter).  Actually it measures 1.047197580733 inches.  For more information please visit this link...  http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/Mi...    I think you meant to say that your scope uses elevation and windage turrets designed to change the point of impact by 1/8 of an inch at 100 yards.  So it would take 8 clicks of turret movement to change the scope settings by 1 m.o.a.    If you needed to compensate for 48.7 inches of bullet-drop during a 500 yard trajectory...  1"@100yards = 5"@500yards  48.7"bullet drop divided by 5" = approximately 9.74 m.o.a elevation adjustment.  9.74 multiplied by 8 = 77.92 clicks which is rounded up or down to be 78 clicks or 77 clicks (since you can't move the scope elevation turret less than one whole click).    You don't need a mil-dot scope.  But you're welcome to want one.  You don't need a Mil-dot Master calculator.  But you're welcome to purchase one.  You'll probably want a calculator of some kind, because doing the math on paper takes longer.  You'll probably want a lazer rangefinder to verify distances to targets.  Using mil-dot equipped scopes is effective, but involves knowing the height & width of an object in order to estimate the distance to it.  A lazer rangefinder is quicker and more precise in many situations (except when weather or foliage obscure the target or scatter the lazer ranging beam).|`|AA11729094	Your scope is 8 clicks equals an inch at 100 yards. 500 yards would be 40 clicks an inch. You may need shims.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Nope, definitely not!     Then again, I'm shooting at 3-4 foot wide targets, not... however wide a minute of angle is. :-D|`|4mb6xaxBaa	48.7 / ( 500 / 100 ) x 8 = 77.92  bullet drop divided by ( distance divided by 100) times clicks per minute of accuracy equals the number of clicks|`|K5AeQuSNaa	No, I am not.

FmZyN6ORaa	both were pretty similar..the game didn't really start until the fourth quarter, and then it got intense...being a giants fan though, I definitely liked last year's Super Bowl better (obviously), and I think there were too many penalties/bad calls in yesterday's game...(and the cardinals lost). also, no one predicted a giants victory against the undefeated patriots in XLII, so it was a bigger upset and more exciting game in my opinion|`|C2CCbTRKaa	I,M GOING WITH THE GIANTS VS.

The Harrison interception for a touchdown could be argued as the best play in superbowl history as well as the touchdown by holmes. Also this game was like the NFC title game in which the cardinals were winning by a good margin the whole game then blew it, only to come back on a two minute drive to win. Not to mention this was history in the making, the steelers going for a record 6th superbowl in franchise history, the cardinals going for there first ever|`|68901cc226a1a5e64d9b9e9528736f88aa	I would like to say yesterday's Superbowl but they blew the call on the last play by not reviewing it. I would have like Kurt Warner to have thrown one last Hale Mary.    So I would say Giants over Patriots from last year.    Peace,|`|jlt7LUyDaa	Steelers - Cards was without question the best, most exciting superbowl off all time. In fact, I'd say it was the best game I've ever seen...period. SB 42 was great too, but this one easily topped it.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	giants vs patriots. that was an underdog giants team who fought the doubt of beating an 18-0 team. plus it ended in thrilling fashion.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	giants vs. pats so we can kick their ***|`|RZIV15e3aa	Steelers vs Cardinals.

And it had good defense. Steelers vs Cardinals, not so much. Plus, the Steelers vs Cardinals game was tainted with hoards of penalty flags.|`|xP08melDaa	The Giants-Patriots won was because of the idea of a "perfect season" was at stake.  Overall, the better game was Arizona-Pittsburgh but the idea bhind the perfect season and the stunning David Tyree catch overpowered that question|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Steelers versus Cardinals was the best SB I have ever seen in my life.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	i think the giants game had a better finish but the cards game was more exciting.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	Giants vs Patriots|`|J74Y5LKxaa	The Steelers / Cardinals game had a lot more action in my opinion, but the Giants win over the Patriots was much more of an upset and therefore a lot more memorable.  I just feel sorry for all the people who lost money yesterday because the Steelers didn't make the spread!

z8waxOJEaa	if harrison had made that play at the end of the game and not committed the penalty that helps give the Cards on of those scores that lead to putting them ahead yeah..but as it was it was the clutch catches in the final drive made by Holmes that braught the trophy back home....all game Holmes was making key catching and stepping up to make up for the great loss of Hines not being at full health....what was holmes stats for the game corect me if Im mistakin but wasnt it something like 9 catchs for 140yd and that full extension in the end zone toes touching the endzone.....i would love to get that picture and have a local artist put it in a  charcoal print on my steeler wall of fame..|`|RZIV15e3aa	Because Santonio caught the game winning touchdown that sent the Cards back to the bottom where they belong.|`|8816e721e2ba35178f9a86d4e3b829f2aa	James Harrison committed a stupid personal foul.|`|uWpwXn6paa	Did you not see the cheap shot he did in the 4th Qtr?

tNerdFYsaa	I think it wasn't his best, but remember this was the number one Defense in the NFL that they were up against, and Pitt had 2 free weeks to game plan this to shut down the playmakers and they got it done until late in the game. But you are right i did feel he was conservative and he threw a ton of check down passes, but thats what the Defense gave him and he went with it. Also, it could be a bit of nerves and pressure. The Cards fans have had nothing to cheer about for years and in probably the biggest game they ever played I'm sure he was a bit timid to call the "big" plays|`|fHxpycJSaa	The Steelers did a good job on Fitz early. They're not going to force it to him when he being successfully double covered. Haley didn't get where he was by doing stupid stuff like ignoring a player of Fitz's talent.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I didn't think it was a bad game overall. I'm just disappointed we didn't get to see the flea-flicker that's been their signature this postseason or at least a trick play of some kind. He didn't use the incredible talent he has to work with to his fullest potential. I don't blame him for not being super aggressive down the field against Pittsburgh's secondary, but he could have pulled a few more exciting plays out of the hat.

But I will say one thing about LBJ is his numbers are close to numbers that only a few people accomplished in the  history of the NBA.    His assist and points per game and rebounds are very good for anyone but he is only 23-24 yrs old so their are not too many players that has those  numbers he has at that age.    and I wll say one thing about MJ,  there has been no other competitor in my opinion that has such a will to win.  I really think that what separates Jordan from other greats.|`|jjjgcuduaa	LeBron has a VERY small chance of cracking the top ten. Kobe's at  8, Jordan is at  6, there's no way he can.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	I think LeBron James has potential to be just as good as Michael if he continues playing the way he has his entire career. His size and strength and speed is unmatchable in today's NBA, which makes his stats easier to capture, while Jordan had to face the era when defense was a lot better than it is today and he still dominated it; redefined basketball. Watch the Cavaliers games and LeBron James dominates everyone.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	even with the numbers its hard to predict the future  lebron might be better if he wins many rings and in the future when la and boston get old the cavs will be the best team,by a large margin so u can exoect a few rings...........  http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/ksp...  cant find why lebron will be better but jordan edges him in everything,still close.........  anything is possible|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Let's just say LeBron's got what it takes to be better than MJ.

Generally speaking the Knicks are not a defensive oriented team.  i mean the Lakers have 96 after 3 quarters.      Every team goes through injuries and so there is no "feeling sorry" business-- they are professionals.      Off course you can subscribe to whatever theory you want.

CP3F9OK9aa	Maybe  a screw is untightened or something. Normally, your backboard should not move, but the whole entire hoop should. Between the rim and the backboard, there should be springs or something that makes it absorb energy. For example, when you dunk, the rim will move with you so it doesn't snap off. The backboard alone should not move. If it moves like, 1 inch or half a centimeter, its fine. But if it shakes a lot, then you either set it up the wrong way or its manufacturer problem. To get better answers, i would add details about the type of rim,  backboard, and if its hung on a wall, or on a pole, etc... All info helps.|`|Mb9K663Jaa	its called basketball its supposed to move if you move it!  look at professional basketball gamese n it moves!  :P|`|sQq8q4Biaa	well its probably loose bolts but you could be complicated and call the manufacturer and complain just to be an asshole... i'd do it :)  If you do tell me how it goes|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Something is missing to stabalize the back board|`|ea78ba2fcd380748f7e34d9cc9b891dfaa	Well it can be a manufacture problem.

8kDAgDAzaa	It's called the Open Hand Rule.  If the QB's arm is moving forward but the ball isn't in his hand (no grip, just floating along with the hand), it's a fumble.

YYqrT4jBaa	First off, cheap paintballs aren't always good. Second, don't base paintballs' quality on their price. Never listen to people who say that a $40 case of paint is crap because its low priced. Quality is sometimes a reflection of price but not always.    Now, for paintballs. You want a brittle shell but not too brittle to break in your barrel and not too hard to not break when they hit people. Visible Impact paintballs are great for a low price. They cost about $38 for a case of 2000. The best part is that you can get them at Wal-Mart. I linked a review for them.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	What would be considered cheap for you? RPS Stingers are about $35 a case (2000). That's one of the cheapest paintballs that are any decent. But remember, the more you pay the better the paintballs will be. If you buy a case of 2000 paintballs for less than $30, you're gonna have breaks and chops.

xOReEw6Waa	Ethical hunting max range with a 308 is 300 to 400 yards tops. Anything thing farther with deer sized animals isn't a good shot because there is so little energy left at impact.. Varmints yes, but not big game. As for target shooting, 700 to 1000 yards is possible, but not with a hunting scope.    As for scopes,Leupold, Nikon and Burris are capable hunting scopes at 3x9 40mm and varmint/range scopes at 6x16 or better with up to 56mm AO. The Nikon Pro Staff and Buckmaster go for $150-$350 and the Leupold's are $200-$500 for hunting applications.  I've hunting in Idaho and Washington state since 1973 and been close enough to deer and elk to slap them on their way through, so I'm not a big fan of 400 yard shots on animals. I do know there are times you only get one chance at a big buck or bull at 400 yards too, and if you have absolute confidence in your weapon and skill, then you can take the shot. Read "The Perfect Shot" for N. American animals, helps a lot.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	The furthest distance you could shoot with it would depend upon how well you can shoot and how well the rifle/scope/cartridge combination performs (and how far the targets are at your shooting range).    The Remington 700 is a nice choice.    Leupold makes nice scopes.  Bushnell scopes offer a good value for my money (if you can't afford Leupold).|`|wtpbA43aaa	lepold scopes are the best, I would go with that|`|gE5n79m7aa	Excellent advise / answers in rife Range.

5nVtNENDaa	This depends on a lot of things. First off- the type of base on your snowboard. A sintered base, which is found on most mid to high-end snowboards, need to be consistently waxed to optimize performance and maintain the integrity of the base. Extruded bases, found on most mid to lower-end snowboards, are designed in a way that no waxing is mandatory. These bases are very easy to maintain for this reason.     If you have a board with a sintered base, you should iron wax it everytime to get the absolute optimum performance, but usually once every 2 or 3 days on the snow is sufficient for most people. Notice I said "iron wax"... this process gives you a better quality job and will last much longer than a simple machine wax. Other factors that might change the intervals are stickyness of the snow and how many runs per day. Now if your board is an extruded base, it will be perfectly happy if never waxed. However, you can still wax it if you want a little extra glide. In this case a machine wax will be just fine and you will get no added benefit from a more expensive iron wax.     Hope that answers your question    Sierra Crew  www.Sierrasnowboard.com|`|LygV4VOOaa	I depend mine on the type of snow i was riding on.     If you ride the fresh stuff the wax will last longer.

2SSD6BP9aa	Some of the people answering don't seem to know what a jockstrap is for.  It is NOT to protect your nuts from being hit by the tennis ball!  A cup - sometimes worn inside a jock - is what would protect you from that.  There should be no reason for you to wear a cup for tennis.  But just because there's no reason for the cup, doesn't meant there's no reason for a jockstrap.    A jockstrap is to give you support down below.  It does that much better than compression shorts and it doesn't restrict your movement at all.  The question is do you need that much support?  That's something only you can answer.  It depends on the size of your equipment, how much it bounces around as you run back and forth, and how much that bothers you.    Not every guy needs a jock for tennis.  Just like not all women need a sports bra for certain sports.  Flat chested women can get away with not wearing a bra at all.  But just because some guys don't need a jock to support their stuff doesn't mean they can say no guy could ever possibly need one.    Will you get teased in the locker room if you wear one?  I don't know.  Jocks are really common at my school.  Almost no one does compression shorts anymore.  More than half the guys on the tennis team wear them.  (Maybe not everyone really needs them but they wear them because other guys do.)  In other sports they are even more common.  A decent number of guys even wear them for gym class - but less than half.  So no one ever gets teased for wearing them.  But if they are not common at your school, then maybe you could end up getting teased.    First figure out if you need the support.  If you want the support but don't want to be teased, then wait till your first practice and see what the other guys are wearing.  If you see just compression shorts but no jocks, then get some compression shorts to go along with the crowd.  If you see both jocks and compression shorts then I would recomend a jock instead of the compression shorts.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHegV7jaY...|`|Z03zgM0maa	No way. I played tennis for 4 years in high school and never wore one. The chances of it hitting you in the nuts is slim to none. Only if you have snail reflexes would you be slow enough to not get out of the way. Plus the ball bounces once before you hit it so it gives you even more time to move. A jockstrap will slow you down and it is extremely uncomfortable for tennis because  you move your legs so much, you might even get a rash. Don't do it.|`|CFsBX9Nxaa	Well it depends. I played for two years in high school and i didnt wear one but it was because it bothered me when i started to move around. So my coach told me to get compression underwear. Like bike shorts but the underwear kind. Well i got those and i was Awesome. I didnt have to worry about my junk flopping around when i started to move around.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Hell no.  If your not good enough to hit the ball away from your nards, then you are not good enough to play tennis.|`|gdU86jYWaa	Guess I am from the old school.  Back in junior and senior high school jockstraps were required for PE class.  Am glad we wore our supporters when play games like dodge ball!    When I took tennis as PE class in college each guy in class wore his jockstrap or some wore cups to protect there package.

Do ab workouts every day.    2) If you don't have daily access to a weight room or gym, do push ups, sit ups, body squats, knee-jumps, and run.    3) Eat more protein and the right amount and type of carbs. What I do after a workout is drink a glass of chocolate milk; it has the protein in it to help build muscle, and some simple sugars do help you recover faster.    4) Lift a little more weight than you think you can.    5) You're not going to go from benching 85 to 300 in a meek.

VghVdPfsaa	To me, they get a good amount of attention, but not nearly as much as the men's side.    Most of the time, the most women's sports coverage is during the Olympics every 2 years. That is probably the closest that the coverage is the same for both men and women. Although ESPN's SportsCenter will run the occasional highlights of women's college basketball or tennis or golf or some other things, it's really not much. And the WNBA is about the same.     However, there isn't really a market for women's sports just yet. Look at the WNBA; their most successful franchise, the Houston Comets, just recently folded. I know there was a women's soccer league a few years back, that folded too. The only successful women's leagues there are are probably the WTA and LPGA Tour.     And I must admit that mostly comes from girls' girly personality. I know that that's a stereotype but it's just true. And some of the disrespect comes from the athlete's themselves. If you saw yesterday's Danica Patrick GoDaddy.com commercials during the Super Bowl, you'll know what I mean (another one that comes to mind is swimmer Natalie Coughlin). I personally don't have a problem with it, but it does make the way people view women's sports differ. If there's not a big market, companies such as ESPN won't have feature stuff for it. Basic laws of supply and demand.     And to me, although I've idolized athletes and coaches such as Mia Hamm, Lisa Leslie, Pat Summitt and the late Kay Yow my whole life, why watch a slower and maybe less physical game when I can watch a fast paced and exciting men's game? I hate to say it, but that's just the way it'll be untill someone TRULY revolutionizes women's sports.|`|otm11IHgaa	No, they don't.  Aside from in the olympics, they are watched way less than men's sports and achievements made by girls or women aren't seen as equivalent to those made by boys (ex. if a girl makes a high level team, or breaks a record, she isn't necessarily viewed as being really athletic or a jock, whereas guys are).  When the Canadian woman's hockey team played at my local rink there were less spectators than the local Jr. A team gets, which is @ a lower level than the WHL.  When the WWHL (women's "WHL" league) played, there were about 100 people at the rink.    We aren't as fast or as strong, so aren't watched as much.|`|17f313c0636520ec01d8f896d35ffb85aa	no because its a waste of time|`|WiIUEObTaa	no. not by a long shot. my current three year rant has been the exclusion of women's lacrosse on network t v. not cable sports but major bigoted networks. pure sexists balderdash. was fortunate enough to see mens, woman's under 19 championships. no television coverage at all. held outskirts vancouver. 87 division one colleges have this sport on full ride scholarships. due to past playing ,was on team Canada's sideline. mens team great player now coach agrees with the idea that woman's version of lacrosse is the more traditional better sport than the mens game.he is head coach syracuse women's program. soccer needs more exposure , women are more team oriented in what is turning into a hot dog sport. women's hockey. great great players. very clean but aggressive. these young ladies can flat out play. very fast pace , lack of whistles. tremendous athletes. this site bashes cheerleaders . only reason for this . cheer leaders are better athletes than players on the field. more intelligent since practises intense .longer in duration yet the  G P A is higher than the male jocks. more serious injury sport, if not the highest injury risk sport. the w n b a was a laughing stock. the people laughing macho men jocks who were to stupid physically unfit to play any sport past 10 years old. the male ego cannot handle womens natural intelligence. much higher than males. it is time to stop the disrespect to women. it has reached its all time low. i am in my sixties. have had to become involved to many times when i have heard sick insulting language used towards the superior sex. . it is the delicate inferior male ego at work that holdsen sports down . i have earned the right to make these statments. won major team championships. box/indoor lacrosse. worlds field at lacrosse many stupid individuale awards. plus a very special door opened. these bigots should shut up and learn. womens sports are exploding. get darts poker off the air. or better yet start womans sports channel. thank you
uARQSXomaa	I used to own a Taurus .38 4" revolver. I was unimpressed with the quality, and the gun quickly developed pretty severe timing problems. Bear in mind however that this was a used gun made quite a while ago. I have since seen a number of Taurus firearms that seem to have much better fit, finish, and general build quality.    I currently own a Ruger SP101, and I love the gun. It's a 2-1/4" .357, but I primarily shoot .38spl through it. The particular model I have is the KSP-321XL which features a bobbed hammer, so it slides out of a pocket or holster easily without catching on clothing. The SP-101 is a proven model that has maintained popularity as a backup or concealed-carry defensive weapon for decades.    Taurus has a huge selection of models to choose from. The 651 and 617 both look like reasonable defensive handguns, but I can't really give any personal opinion of them. They appear to be extremely similar to some classic models from Smith and Wesson who have made some of the finest revolvers ever built (e.g. the 617 and 686), but the similarities may be aesthetic.    BTW: The ballistics of the .357 are a far sight better than .38 or 9mm, and if you get a .357, you can always practice with the less expensive .38spl and load .357 for defensive carry purposes.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	I like Ruger products..... Why the .38? --- That cartridge is a little anemic when it comes to stopping power.... Consider a pistol chambered in 9MM.... Its got plenty of stopping power without overdoing it...    http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Better is a pretty subjective sort of thing. Depending on exactly what models you are looking at Ruger's have a long, long history of being the most rugged and trouble free revolvers you can buy. In one of the leagues I shoot in, I was asking one of our revolver afficionados about an issue I was having with my Smith and Wesson 686+. Namely that the ejector rod would start to unscrew and that if I didn't check it frequently could unscrew enough to prevent the cylinder from being able to open.    His response, was, "Well, you can start out by just wrenching it down tight. Then you can try lock tight and then wrenching it down tight. Then you can sell it and buy a Ruger." (This is a semi common problem with some models of Smith and Wesson)    Now, I still have the Smith and Wesson (in fact I have a model 19 as well) but the point was well taken that the Ruger revolvers have at least a half century reputation for reliability and ruggedness. Ruger also has an excellent reputation for service if you do have problems with your firearm.    Now, Taurus and revolvers are much newer than Ruger, but still have better than a decade of very good track record. Taurus made their revolver name with going after the really high powered rounds, .454 Casull, .45 Colt, .44 Magnum and such. Much of this know how has been incorporated into their smaller guns and they are getting a good reputation.    So, generally, the Ruger revolvers are considered to have a better fit and finish, be a little smoother, particularly in the trigger and all around considered to be a little "better" by most folks in the shooting community. However, they are often $80 - $150 more than a similar model of Taurus. Depending on how you view carry:     - I just need a functional gun, as it is going to get impounded if I have to use it and I looking at a 25 feet and in encounter range - then I'd suggest a Taurus.    - I'm looking for something I want to shoot, and is the best quality I can afford and plan on shooting regulary, possibly even customize in the future. - Then I'd probably suggest the Ruger.    I would be remiss in saying though that if you are looking at .38 specials in particular you really should take a look at some of the Colt guns on the used market at a minimum.    Thinkingblade|`|Wbo0PEZaaa	9mm|`|lmWqwpygaa	Ruger costs about 20% more, but Taurus has lifetime warranty.|`|OnWmqs4paa	I've had a Taurus model 66 (.357) for about twenty years, it has seen some abuse and is still a fine revolver, personally I carry a Glock 27, very sweet!    PS I have a ruger mini-14 no complaints there either...|`|XNpnK4vpaa	Both Ruger and Taurus small framed .38 Special revolvers have their merits.    The Ruger SP101 (yes, I have one) is built like a tank, reliable, 'user friendly' and easy to maintain.  The purchase price is reasonable.  The only downside is that in the snub-nosed revolver category, it is one of the heaviest pistols.    The Taurus Model 85 (and the variations similar to the 85) is small, lighter (than the Ruger SP101), user-friendly and generally gets the job done.  It may not stand up well to rough treatment or abuse.    The contestants you haven't mentioned would be the Smith & Wesson Model 60, the Model 36 (I own one) and similar variations.  While similar in size to the Taurus models (which imitate the S&W revolvers), the S&W revolvers cost more, but also offer better fit, finish, smoothness and a tendency to last longer.    I've fired all three.  I prefer the Ruger for target practice and the S&W for carry (because its lighter than the Ruger SP101).    Older S&W and Taurus small-framed revolvers may not be rated for +P ammunition.  New production models are rated for +P ammunition (to the best of my knowledge).  Ruger SP101's are able to handle +P ammunition.      I don't reccomend shooting .357 Magnums from small frame pistols, because the recoil is severe.|`|eY0MhGfmaa	I think Rugers have a finer fit and finish, but both are fine weapons. It's worth mentioning that Taurus is known for their exceptional customer service.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Why not get a .357? They're the same size, only slightly heavier and more expensive, and you have the option of carrying *far* more firepower. And, of course, you can still load .38's for cheaper target practice and reduced recoil when you desire.    Take a look at the S&W J-frames. The 60-14 (2" barrel, .357 mag, all-stainless) is my favorite revolver. They're pricier, yes, but incredibly solid and nicely-built.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	Taurus is located in Brazil so you may have problems with contacting them|`|g4Dxlklxaa	Absolutely go Ruger.     That's great that Taurus has a lifetime warranty because you're going to need it. With them, they are hit or miss... Some are awesome, some are lemons. I've seen gunsmiths with plenty of Taurus semis and wheelguns waiting on parts. Rugers on the other hand are virtually indestructible. You could run one over with a tank and it will still fire and it is 100% made in the USA. All Taurus guns are made in Brazil. Plus, with the Ruger SP101 you can feed it a steady diet of .357 magnum loads and it stays tight. You probably already know, but remember that a .357 chambered pistol also fires .38 Specials, .38 +p+ etc., so you get flexibility there.     BTW, the S&W airlites are great guns and easily concealed, but hurt like a sonofabech if you actually intend to fire.|`|43V1pN2Taa	i like rugars but honestly it's the same as ford and chevy|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Have you seen the new Ruger lcr.  If you had, you wouldn't even be posting this question.  Check out the style of that cylinder.  Ruger claims that the hogue grips reduce felt recoil by about 50%.  They have spent a few years perfecting the dao trigger.  Guns and ammo mag just did a review on the gun this month.  They really liked it.  http://www.ruger-firearms.com/LCR/index....|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Rugers are definitely better built but they are more expensoive and generally heavier  I have owned many many Taurus revolvers over the past 21 years and have never had an issue with any of them  My Ruger experience is running about 50/50 with two disabling malfunctions on the first outing, one on the first shot    As far Taurus being a bad investment  Those Taurus revolvers only cost about $150 in the 70's and are going for around $300 now  That would be a 100% increase which beats the Colt example given  The last Taurus snub I sold for $400 was bought for $170 three years before  That is better than a 100% increase    I actually had to take a loss on the Rugers I bought and sold|`|QNX9NET3aa	Personally I would buy the Ruger. A little more expensive but built like a brick. Taurus has done much in the last few years to improve there quality.However at resale the Ruger will hold it's value bettor.|`|AA12274507	I have a Smith & Wesson in .38 with a 2" barrel. It is the model 637 airweight and it is perfect for concealed carrying. It is certainly not good for anything over 20-30 feet. But it is better than nothing and a hell of a lot more better than carrying that cinder block of a Beretta 92 around with me. Here is a pic of it:    http://server6.theimagehosting.com/album...|`|e20ea1a3352e7d0bf5b5005b71182ae4aa	i would go taurus, but either is a good choice|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Taurus is not a name brand, but, their quality has definitly improved over the years.  You will get good service from a Taurus pistol.    That said - the Taurus is a bad investment.  Most name brand pistols - Ruger, S&W, and Colt after the first two or three years of ownership will begin to appreciate $30 a year.  I bought a Colt Gold Cup in the 1980's for under $500 new and recently sold it for over $950.  Go find a 1980's Taurus pistol for the same price and it won't fetch more than $250 today.    The money you save on the Taurus today will bite you in the butt later on in life.  If this is a pistol you plan to work hard with - around salt water, boats, outdoors camping in the rain, lots of rough handling - obviously a name brand pistol isn't going to command much appreciation after being worked to death.  This is when a Taurus makes allot of sense to buy.    Hope this helps|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	They are both good brands.  Ruger is going to be a bit more expensive, but if you ever plan on selling it, you are going to get a better price with the ruger.    Since I'm an automatic person, I'd recommend getting an automatic.  They are easier to reload and can have a thinner profile.  Ruger LCP is an example, or a Kel Tec.  I'm just throwing it out there.  Couldn't help myself.  I know revolvers are good, but I just like automatics better. (My kel tec fits in my jeans back pocket. . . . . . .try that with your revovler)

I'd just confuse you if I attempted to explain it, so you can read about the basics here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Champi...    NFL - 32 teams, separated into two conferences of 16, which are further divided into 4 divisions of 4. Each team plays 16 games, and at the end of the season 6 teams from each conference make the playoffs (all 4 division winners and the next 2 best teams, called "wild cards"). Each conference then does a single-elimination tournament (semi-complicated, the top two division winners get byes in the first round) and each conference produces a champion. The two champions play in the league championship game - the Super Bowl.

z28L84Cjaa	The most likely way it would happen (if at all), and it is a little messed up based on the new point system  Nadal beats Federer in the French Open (Nadal has no gain, Federer loses 200 points) increasing the gap to 3460)  Federer beats Nadal at Wimbledon (Federer gains 600, Nadal loses 800 ) narrowing the gap to 2060  Points from the Olympics fall reducing the gap by another 600 points to 1460  If Federer finds his form in the ATP World Tour 1000 and 500s, he could have a real shot at retaking the  1 spot at the US Open.  He lost a few hundred points at a time when he didn't defend his title from the previous year.  Enough of those point gains, gives Federer a real chance to return to the top.  Nadal also has a ton of points to defend, making it more difficult (and adds more pressure) on Nadal.  Federer would need to repeat at the US Open, and possibly need Nadal to lose more than the 180 points that come off because of the new point structure if he makes it to the semifinals again, but he has a real chance in 2009.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	improve his backhand|`|YKDhstvkaa	has to get more points and titles than nadal|`|poEJEuwNaa	Hire someone to take out Nadal. Is Tonya Harding available?|`|LtOxnF0kaa	I think that Roger Federer will never be able to regain 1 as long as Nadal their.Im a big Nadal fan and  Roger is 28 and Nadal just has it in the bag.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	A lot of points, he has dug himself in quite a hole.  Personally, I don't think he is going to get back.  Nadal is just too good and getting better.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	sasuke great answer ! lol    Its true. Roger shouldnt be concentrating on the  1 ranking just now, he should be focussing on how to beat Nadal.|`|jByScRfraa	Nadal has a points lead of 3,260 in the new points system. In order for to regain the  1, he would have to win the French and have Nadal lose in the 1st round which would make it only a 260 point lead. So then he would need to win Wimbledon too, but you know that won't happen cause Nadal is way too good at Roland Garros. Odds are that Federer will have some problems getting to the final so by the time they get to Wimbledon Federer will be down by about 4,000.
3Twg9Uuuaa	As long as the firearm is not concealed, and you are out of the city limits you can carry a firearm for self protection. Glendora and Pasadena, I believe have stronger restrictions within city limits and have extended their city limits well into the national forest just for that purpose to control firearms use where the NFA would not. I do agree with previous post that you need to check with the local forest ranger in the district you plan on traveling for any new restrictions.|`|43V1pN2Taa	you need to contact a forest ranger,they will tell you everything|`|TvARYVRJaa	call um  it prob. is  is this calif.  ??
eY1Vttiyaa	Um... sorry to say, but your chances are slim.  First of all, it is impossible to play a few times a year and be good, that's like someone picking up a guitar and able to do the Heartbreaker solo after a week.  Maybe, though, if you play a lot, maybe like 5-7 days a week, you can get good.  Most of the tennis pros went to private schools and only go for like 4 hours and play tennis for 5 hours a day.  But, it is possible, after all Sam Querrey started getting serious about tennis when he was 14 and he is good.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Well, your gonna have to try harder than that. Lessons will help, but if you wanna go pro you'll need to teach yourself more than anything else.     I started last year when i was 15, as a freshmen in high school. After the Season, i knew i wanted to be a professional tennis player. I had some natural talent too, i ended up winning conference. I havent even been playing a year yet, but im working on becoming a pro.     The Thing is, you have to be more dedicated than you think. You need to play everyday, you need to practice everyday. You need to research form, tactics. You need to train your body, train your mental aspects of the game. You need to improve hand eye coordination, reaction time, footwork....    In the summer i played every day for 2 and a half hours on avg. Still, i did not improve as much as i hoped, and if i waste this summer like i did last summer, then i will surely not become pro. The thing is, i just spent the summer playing, not practicing to get better. Make sure you focus on getting better.     I Saved up my money for a tennis ball machine and bought one. In the summer i plan using this everyday. Still, i dont know if this is enough to become pro.     But i will try no matter what, and if i cant get pro, then maybe my son will, maybe i will become a tennis coach, and maybe i can coach a pro. But Pro or not, Tennis will be in life, and i will try as hard as i can to achieve my goal, as you should too.|`|tNc0qMT1aa	you would have to start practicing at LEAST 5 times a week and get a very good coach. it would be very helpful if you lived in a big city so you get a good coach

xOReEw6Waa	You don't mention your age and that might have something to do with it. The other thing is maturity.     If you haven't completed a Hunter Education program, now would be a great time to sigh up for it. Most states require an Orange Card to hunt even small game these days, and you only have to do the class once.Taking the class shows your parents you are serious about the activity and want to learn all you can to be safe.Since you are going with an adult, there is always direct supervision too.     My 11 year old son completed his Hunter Ed course last fall in time for deer season. We went out, but never did get him a shot on a buck. My son got 95% on the test too, better than half the adults in the class. He can also shoot his .243 Winchester well. So, my advise is get your class taken care of and involve your dad as quality time and to learn about hunter safety himself. Hunting as a sport is actually safer than soccer,football and baseball, statistically. The other aspect of shooting is non-hunting activities like skeet and trap, target shooting and just plinking. I had my own 30-06 when I was 14, but I grew up in North Idaho where hunting was an almost expected activity. I would much rather see a child, boy or girl, interested in shooting more than plying Nintendo games for sure.|`|43V1pN2Taa	good luck|`|SiPGcBnYaa	i've actually never had this problem sorry|`|sSiGcBPdaa	they dont let you go cause hunting sucks and it is dangerous. become a vegeteterian|`|TvARYVRJaa	well  thats  a tough question  i would  ask mom and dad  both and get there ansewer   hunting is a dangerous i can understand dads  position,,,,,,,,,   but  he must  think of you also it is what you like  to do then tell them  you have already been hunting  which i think  you have not ?? ok thanks and good luck good hunting|`|nooi0ldjaa	first, go take your hunters safety class, show your parents your responsible. then offer to take your dad with you and the "adult" you go with. but end the end its their house and their rules.|`|DBP3lU8Taa	is this a trick question..?|`|aDNdND6oaa	Well, I don't know how old you are, but I would be cautious about going with friends at a younger age, 15 or 16 would be the youngest I could imagine.      See if you could get one of the other hunters parents to go along.  This may be enough to persuade your parents.|`|g4Dxlklxaa	Easy... Bring dad along.     I think his main concern is for your safety, which just means he's good dad. If you can show him that you are responsible and safe, then he'll be more willing to cave. This doesn't JUST apply to hunting though... If you drive like an idiot or have bad grades, that also shows how responsible you can be.     In the meantime, explain to him that an experienced adult will be along, you will have a safety vest on, and only one person will be shooting at a time. It may even help to have your dad meet the adult that will take you out.     However, if that adult has a problem meeting your dad, that probably isn't a good person to be shooting with in the first place.

fmUGHvgHaa	ECW 1/27/09 Results and Review Matt Hardy Released  Labels: boogeyman, ecw, ecw championship, ecw review, Finlay, mark henry, paul burchill, tommy dreamer  Theodore Long came out to inform everyone on ECW that Matt Hardy is now officially off the ECW roster and is now on Smackdown permanently. Thats fine with me. Jack Swagger came out and wanted to celebrate his new reign, and announced that this night would feature the celebration for the new ECW champion, and you know what? Its about time that we had an undefeated champion on WWE programming.    The Boogeyman came out from under the ring and scared Jack Swagger away!    The Boogeyman defeated Ricky Ortiz via countout    Im not sure what happened here. Ricky Ortiz was thrown out of the ring by The Boogeyman just stayed in the ring and looked scary; what a sorry excuse for a match. This was the dumbest match or attempt at a match ever.    Finlay defeated Paul Burchill    This match was a hard hitting brawl style match up. It featured a lot of hard shots between Burchill and Finlay, but didnt really prove to be all that great overall. Horswoggle distracted Katie Lea for a short break in the action, and after that it was all Finlay. Too bad they never went anywhere with that whole Pirate Paul gimmick. Finlay hit his finisher, and Paul lost yet another match up. Nothing too great here, just another match up for Paul to lose; How long before Paul gets fired? I think its going to be sooner than later.    Mark Henry defeated Tommy Dreamer    This was a hard hitting match in which Tommy Dreamer proved yet again that he needs to retire. Ive been rooting for Tommy Dreamer to retire for a long time now, and for whatever reasons the WWE still finds it in their heart to keep him employed. However, they make him lose these hard fought battles with nothing more than whimper to end it all. This match was heavily one sided, Dreamer gave everything he had, but Mark Henry caught Tommy Dreamer in mid air and dropped him with the worlds strongest slam and pinned Tommy Dreamer yet again! Thats right, Mark Henry defeats a dead fish called Tommy Dreamer.    Ecw on sci-fi 1/27/09 Results and Review    The Boogeyman defeated Ricky Ortiz via countout  Finlay defeated Paul Burchill  Mark Henry defeated Tommy Dreamer    Jack Swagger losing his belt was boring to me. I like Swagger, but he needs to stop with the lisp. Someone get the kid a speech coach and get a professional linguist to help him out a little bit. Overall, not the worse night in wrestling, but also not the best night in wrestling; ECW on sci-fi still has a lot in an hour show, which is a good thing in a bloated wwe marketplace.|`|M200Idq0aa	BREAKING: *MAJOR* Spoilers for tonight's RAW revealed!

He beat Murray and Tsonga, then took Nadal to 5 close sets. His confidence is going to take him pretty deep in the next tournament as well, especially when combined with his forehand.    For the women - Jelena Dokic.  After so much time off, and not really being in top form, her level of play was phenomenal.  I hope we see a great deal more from her the remainder of the season.|`|x3g32RDnaa	victoria azarenka and jelena dokic  and gilles|`|KSvpLcHxaa	I say Nadal. He added some miles on his serve, he was hitting the ball flatter, moving as good as ever. He was smoking people left and right until he reached the Semis. He was able to beat Federer after a 5 hour plus match showing he fittiness and endurance was at an all time high. I think its amazing that he is number and just keeps finding ways to improve his game.

They stayed in some hotel which is more like a dirty old hostel and the respiratory infection almost cost them the summit.  So maybe that`s something to think about.  I`m sure even a regular carpentar`s dust mask will help prevent inhaling dust etc, and you can get it in any hardware store.  The surgical masks you can get in any med supply store, possibly even in a good pharmacy and def. online.

xhPKkkELaa	Welcome to surfing. Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers. Having "surfed" a couple times before is nice, but it really doesn't count. There are way too may dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.    Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.    Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.    Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop when you finally get ready to buy a board and discuss your skill level, your size (wieght is very important, but how tall you are is virtually irrelevnat) and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. You should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.    And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment.    Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.    Surfing is incredible and iot has provided me with a lifet time of fun. I hope you take the time to learn the right way, and you too can have a lifetime of fun. Good luck!    http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:  http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...  http://360guide.info/surfing/surfboard-t...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...|`|fm5QR6hYaa	I totally agree with John F. there. Find a good local surf shop and ask the people that work there. They usually know there stuff, and some even offer lessons. Get some face to face advice. It will save you lots of trouble.|`|4veNeNU6aa	Start Longboarding.  you'll find it alot easier, then you can make the transition to shorter and shorter boards once you feel comfortable.|`|r1FX4xfMaa	ER130 is right. you really should start off with a longboard or a mini mal or a fun board. it will be a lot easier than starting with a shortboard. it will also be a lot faster to learn on a longbaord. shortboards are designed for experienced riders. however, you can infact start off on a shortboard, but it will take all of your time and dedication if you want to start surfing on that thing any time soon. so if you want to learn how to surf and everything, start off on a longboard. once you get that, move on to a shortboard. if you want to learn on a shortboard, it will take a while, but with practice, you can get it. longboards are also good because you can surf in flat waves that you couldnt with a shortboard. there are also fish boards too. so your choice. hope this helps.|`|QPheve7faa	The bigger the board - the easier for beginners.    So longboard- borrow one from a friend or buy a really cheap one for starters.    In the long run I think surfing is the way to go.    Just get in the water!!|`|8JXJTz2Maa	Start on a long board you'll look like a w-anker walking down the beach as a learner with a short board. Advance when you get bored with your long board. Short boards are a lot harder than folks think.|`|P941l5b0aa	It will be easier for you to catch smaller waves with a long board in the beginning when you are just learning.|`|XX2MotEmaa	Longboard first  funshape second  shortboard last
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Is your son racing?  As if so he doesn't have a lot of options at the height he is.  He could still race the kx65 till he turns 13 but perhaps he may want to move on as many of the boys do by the time they are nearing 13.  Have a look at the crf150r as it is a great bike and he should be able to manage that.  You may have to trim the seat down a bit and use starting blocks on the line, but if he wants to stick with the 2 stroke perhaps something like a yz85 or kx85.  Post a bit more information about what use he is going to put the bike to, but if he has been riding the kx 65 I am sure even if not racing he would find something like a ttr125cc a bit lame|`|qM4cMNufaa	yz 85|`|dcDRHNDQaa	125cc would go alright but they are a dieing breed. So maby a 250cc but I would set the throddle down untill he gets used to the extra power. good luck|`|vUeh2C64aa	a yamaha yz 85 or honda crf 150 they are both easy bikes to ride and learn on and they race well.and definately dont get a 250 that would be asking for ur son to hurt himself badly.and a 65 would be a waste of time and as i am currently running 3rd in my state races.(australian state racing) i have a bit of an idea.|`|WIsKyL1Maa	I would get him a CR80,RM80,KX80, or YZ80 he will love any of them.|`|VjTe48CDaa	"I love emo girls with sex hair!!" you wanna give a 90 lb. kid a 250f? you're a moron.      If he wants to step up from the 65/90 then any 85 will do really, it's just up to him on what he feels comfortable on.|`|qsBxFa9Laa	well im going to awenser this question out of my experience from dirt-bike riding. when i was 12 my dad got me a kx 80 two stroke. i was about 4 foot 9 and it was perfect for me to grow into but still to the point where i can touch the floor. the kx 80 had just the right of power for me because i didnt want anything that will go too fast but not too slow. and this was the perfect amount of speed so when i got better it still was a good bike for me. good luck and god bless
6da3ee9b09b2c0e77cd2805c92c4119faa	There used to be a waiting list of about 10 years to get permits for running a private trip.  Now the park service has gone to a lottery system ... you sign up, keep fingers crossed, and take your chances.     You can take solo kayaks and be accompanied by commercial outfitters for support boats.  If you are familiar at all with Whitewater classifications, then you know that standard river ratings are on a 6 point scale, class 1 being relatively easy riffles or small rapids and class 6 being essentially impassable except by luck.     The Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is on such a huge scale, that it is actually rated on a 10 point system in order to accommodate all the variables a river of that volume can throw at you.     The skills required for a kayaker to negotiate Grand Canyon include:  1. A bomber roll. The water is too fast and cold to really enjoy swimming.  2. The ability to turn sideways to a big wave train and paddle out of it.  3. The ability to keep your balance and your cool in sustained funny water (whirlpools and boils occur at the bottom of many rapids and along eddy lines).  4. The ability to scout and choose a big-water line.

MbcvI1A9aa	WR the most. washington and rolle were good back there. the only reason why people say we need to upgrade at CB is because mcallister was hurt and were pretty old at CB but with ed reed back there who needs CB's. maybe a 2nd,3rd or 4th CB. 1st WR is what ravens need most. mason may be in his last year. as good as percy harvin is hes only 5'10 like the rest of the ravens recievers. i like darrius heyward-bey in this one especially since he went to maryland. other options:  demetruis byrd  jeremy maclin  michael crabtree (if hes still left)|`|H7AcXAyaaa	WR.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	1) Chris McAllister keeps getting hurt so the Ravens need a new shutdown Corner.  2) Samari Rolle is getting older and is a step slower, so they could stand t draft 2 corners.  3) The Ravens need a Big Speedy Wide Receiver, a Larry Fitzgerald or Anquoin Bolden type wide receiver who can stretch defenses while Mark Clayton and Derrick Mason move the chains.  4) Being a Ravens Fan, I would love to get another big physical Defensive Tackle like Haloti Ngata. They would drive opposing defenses crazy.  5) We have 3 Tight Ends, but none of them could stay healthy. Maybe draft a Tight End in a late round.  6) the Ravens are also going to need at least one more linebacker. Ray Lewis, Bart Scott and Terrell Suggs are all free-agents. Many sportswriters say the Ravens will be able to keep 2, but not all 3.|`|6pIspe7iaa	they need to replace either Lewis or Scott. i like the LB from USC {rey manuglala} The ravens can not resign both LB's|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	WR. Badly.    Mason/Clayton just isn't gonna work. If smart, Ravens go for Heyward-Bey. Ready to play immediately and played college ball at Maryland.|`|qktegr2baa	wr|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Unless the Ravens can find a way to keep Lewis, Scott, and Suggs, they'll need a linebacker.    Whether or not that situation is resolved before the draft will remain to be seen, but regardless of what happens at LB, I would think a CB is a higher priority than a WR is this draft.    If a standout WR were to fall to the Ravens in the first round, or if there's a glut of CBs where one could fall to their second round selection, I could understand taking the WR first.    In addition to covering potential losses at LB and upgrading WR and/or CB, trying to upgrade the lines on both sides of the ball couldn't hurt.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I still think the Ravens need a corner-back. They were lucky this year, because by the time the quarterback seen the people open, they were using viewing this on their back. I would keep Fabian Washington over Rolle.|`|UDqMdvESaa	They're going to draft a DB   They're going to go after Boldin if Arizona can't keep him

L8bUjthkaa	Carmelo Anthony, Denver Nuggets-    This might be the most shocking inclusion on this list, but I have thought he was overrated from the minute he stepped on the court in the NBA. Why, you ask? Let me count the reasons.    1. He's a selfish player with an attitude problem. Even though he's matured somewhat, his run-ins with coaches are well-documented.    2. He is hailed as a superstar on the level of LeBron James yet he hasn't made an All-Star team still.    3. His defense is sub-par at best. Just plant your eyeballs on him for 10 possessions or so on defense and you'll immediately see what I'm talking about.    Anthony is a very good player but he also is more of a sidekick than a go-to guy in my opinion because on offense, he lacks a go-to move that he can score reliably in the clutch. There, I've made my case. Apologies to the legions of Melo tee-wearing fans but that's just how I feel.

He should stay retired.|`|0E8SPyyXaa	if that happens i will have to order wrestlemania even though i order every wrestlemania|`|5oaOOquXaa	That     is      true        or          it     could     be    Chris   Jericho   vs  the       Nature    Boy    Ric     Flair     with      Mickey    Rourke   as   the    special      guest    referree.|`|CJzbIhWuaa	no, flair should stay retired, especially the way they did his retirement last year, i say since he was bashing hall of famers, he should wrestle the head of this years class, STONE COLD, with flair and rourke in his corner|`|TWQNYhVVaa	I doubt it..but it is possible..|`|Kecfbgm5aa	i think it will unfortunatley happen. i dont like this cuz flair had an excellent end to his career so why would he wreck that by losing to y2j at wm25. im all for flair as a one time ref for a jericho match but not a ric wrestling match|`|aWVZb2Pgaa	I think he is just coming back this one time. He wanted his last match at a wrestlemania to be with HBK not Jericho.     Good thinking tho|`|F3VjJAdiaa	i know flair is doing the indy circuit with his son, but it doesn't mean he won't rise from the dead yet again to wrestle at wm 25. I think it would be a mistake but it still could happen|`|r2MfXmkqaa	Rourke has a better chance then Flair. But i can see Rourke vs. Jericho and Jericho destory Rourke then Flair come out and beat Jericho down leaving Rourke and Flair to celebrate

OfNTLq3Qaa	Ric Flair!|`|r2MfXmkqaa	um, nah but Booker was the closest...|`|mxqAOxYRaa	Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Vince Mcmahon as far as i know, the Rock just barely changed his themes|`|w173betxaa	Colin Delaney|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Cant really think of one because they always tweek it in some way. I would say HBK is the closest thing to what you are asking. At first Sensational Sherri use to sing his theme song and once she left WWE he modified it to his voice and kept it that way ever since.    I would also say Ric Flair but he has been in the business since... forever, so there is no telling if he did have another theme song for himself.|`|vaVkveEkaa	Well, you could count Shane McMahon with the "Here comes the money!" theme, and you could also count Vince with the "No Chance in Hell" theme.     -Carlito's also never changed his theme, and also Maria and Melina never altered her theme if you count Divas.     -Chris Jericho (if you didn't count the one week he used that Saliva track) has never changed Break Down The Walls since his debut.     -For the past, Ric Flair did alter his theme (through different symphonies) but never alter the official track. In WCW and WWE, Booker T kept the same "Rap Sheet" theme for at least ten years.    -The late Chris Benoit never changed his theme throughout his time in WWE, and his theme in WCW doesn't count really, because he was always part of a stable or using someone else's theme.    That's all I can think of for now....hope I get the ten points.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Not that I can think of....Ric Flair has had pretty much the same,just added a WOOOO but that would be a mod..|`|a5X1sHHpaa	Carlito and Shawn Michaels .    but HBK changed his theme from girl singing to male singing cuz he got married .|`|YWmUFv5Iaa	i think shawn micheals or ric flair|`|sQpoIxf7aa	HBK yeh he had another theme with the mid night rockers but that was Marty's idea so as far as im concerned HBK has always had the same theme|`|7BS1L0oBaa	Colin Delaney  The Miz  Kofi Kingston  CM Punk  Branden Walker  Ricky Ortiz  Evan Bourne  Jack Swagger|`|QpRUNk0laa	Shawn Michaels had the same Lyrics, but the first verison had Sensational Sherrie singing it, than it was Jimmy Hart, than it was him singing it|`|AW7cvRzCaa	Ric Flair with a slight modification and Shawn Michaels has changed his very slighty because the late Sherri Martel was singing in it.  His marriage had nothing to do with it.  He was forced to change it because of the problems between the release of sherri and the WWE sometime ago.
3Twg9Uuuaa	Fished there many times, best spots are near the dam. The lake allows remote controlled toy boats in some of the best fishing areas. Also the water gets some run off from the near by dairies and stinks because of it and the fish have the same oder and taste. I fish there now only for the fun of it and release everything I catch. Try the green and chartreuse floating baits for the trout and the stinkiest catfish bait you can get. Save a mackerel from that pier fishing trip and use that. There are bass and crappie but nothing to write home about. Camping is nice there, a lot of stars at night still as less Development around the area.|`|oMjVp4zGaa	This is probably the only lake in Southern California I haven't fished. But, in conjunction with chris w's answer, has anyone ever thought of having a remote controlled boat, take a crank bait out to the middle and using the quick release set-up used on down-riggers it would snap free if bit by a fish or pulled on from shore by the angler holding the rod?
sPiwb8Hraa	That was proven a long long time ago sir. So my answer is yes.|`|BH05gFobaa	yes it does, qb isnt the whole team|`|mlAvI4CTaa	big ben was better|`|ajnGHNr8aa	It just shows that the best team or player does not always win. It all depends on who gets the breaks at the right time. This game was over going into the 4th quarter but the Cards found a way to come back and they were the better team in that quarter. The Steelers got the break of too much time on the clock and a pass into triple coverage that should not have even been thrown but fell into the arms of an average receiver who did little in the game but won the MVP. I think the MVP should be considered for both teams, regardless if they win or lose. One great catch does not make you and MVP on one drive of the game. Brining your team back from 13 down in the last quarter to take the lead, that makes an MVP. Great game though.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Last year's Super Bowl proved that.|`|5lDS78Rnaa	yes it does kurt had the game won! but now we are not going to see him anymore maybe he wont retire|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	I didn't realize that had to be proven.    Lots of Superbowls were won by the team with the 2nd best QB on the field.|`|fHxpycJSaa	The better quarterback  DID win. Big Ben should have been MVP.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No.|`|l1pewZpaaa	Yeah but then again Roethlisberger doesn't exactly have a Fitzgerald on his team|`|liUG1m9Waa	big ben was considered better you idiot.    warner wasnt even the startter wwhen camp opened|`|dfo8gSaraa	Define "better".  Stats wise, Warner did better.  But, when the game was on the line, Roethlisberger PERFORMED.  Hate all you like, that last drive was executed very well by Ben.    At the end of the day, stats don't mean jack....the final score does.
68c1d5b1f14b95ec630477c10b85baefaa	Plastic melted onto smooth metal actually chips off fairly easily. I have had to remove plastic from many machined parts. A good set of picks makes the process easier. Just don't use the hammer and chisel!    As for this being a firearm that has been subjected to extreme temps, the firearm may not be salvageable at all. High temperatures will ruin the heat treating of the barrel and chamber areas. This means that they may be softened or if the temperature was reduced rapidly they could be very brittle. In any case, firing the weapon could result in metal failure and serious injury.|`|AA10232540	Use a soldering iron to cut the plastic loose.  It heats to far less than the tempering temp of a firearm.|`|16gnzVayaa	Like Jracciato said above me, metal's hardness will change if heated for a prolonged period of time. Very rapid cooling of hot metal will harden the surface. If you heat up metal and let it cool gradually, the metal will become softer. When tempered steel lost it's original properties, it is no longer the same. If you chrome or re-blue a tight gun, the gun will shoot a little differently after its done because the gun was cooked in chemical bath during the process. Metal will wrap from heated chemical baths. The heat from a fire that melted storage cases was much greater than controlled chemical baths.    I am not sure if there are any VERY noticeable changes in the slide and frame but I am pretty certain all springs in that gun will be effected.     Salvage that gun and don't take any chances.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Simply soak the pistol in MEK (methel ethel keytone) overnight and all the major solids will melt.  Then rinse or spray with triclhlorethane and it will be fine.  No doubt there are other plastic disolving solutions available.  Use what you find locally.    These are solvents commonly used in places that either work in plastic fabrication, or, prepare metal for different types of finishing - like chrome, plating, or powder coating.    This is a great example of why you never store any ammo in a fire rated gun safe.    Most fire rated safes have a hole in the rear for the electrical cord that goes to the dehumidifier.  What they do not tell you - is you need to visit your local electrical supply house for some 'FireStop' sealer - it fills in the rest of the hole and prevents the hot fire from coming in that little hole.....    Hope this helps    Hope this helps.|`|AA10182211	SWAT magazine, about 3 years back did an article on exactly this issue.  They had great success and included what exactly to do.      Dec 2005  -  Project Phoenix      http://www.swatmag.com/archive_2005/dec0...|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	If you handle or use MEK or trichorathane make sure to take all precautions against exposure cumulative liver toxin (MEK)|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Remove as much plastic as posible then have a gunsmith get it out of the action.  Depending on how hot it got all the springs could be wrecked.  The blueing is probably messed up too so you would want it re done.    Unfortunately most firesafe are unsuitable for storing guns.  The insulation contains water and can cause rust.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	as brianwv6 said, freeze it with nitrogen or put in freezer and plastic will become very brittle. if you heat and cool over time, the metal and plastic will sepperate on its own|`|AA11729094	I'd use a mapp gas torch to remelt the plastic off the metal parts, the plastic will melt well before the heat can damage the metal parts.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	make sure the gun is completely empty (not live) and heat it up again so the plastic melts and let it just melt off.|`|BLIjEkE5aa	Try freezing it. the plastic should become very brittle then and should easily chip off.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Your gun may be toast.  The heating, especially if it was for a prolonged period of time may have screwed up the temper of the metal.  This is what insurance is for.
ndopqX6Taa	Anyone who watched the game knows his feet were inbounds.    Why would you waste your time with anyone who didn't think they were as they are obviously an idiot who can't see things objectively.|`|jMAn10NOaa	They showed it over and over. It was a spectactular catch!|`|sBmV2pstaa	They actually accidentally showed the correct view for determining the catch. They only showed that view ONCE. he didnt have both feet down. But they kept rerunning theplay in that vague high corner angle and the view to where you couldnt see Holmes feet. I aint crazy. I saw it and millions other saw it. They did not show the most effective angle but one time and the other vague ones  over and over and over. Look to youtube in the coming days. I am not crazy I know what I saw.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	both feet were in the endzone and get over it cards fan|`|LNzIBlwaaa	Here is a zoom photo that Santonio Holmes got two feet down in bounds for the touchdown.  http://www.steelersdepot.com/blog/2009/0...|`|7e6591ac4a2ede1a407a83fa0245c719aa	actually, his right foot is an inch higher than his left, leading me to conclude that he DIDN"T get both feet down!!!OOOOPS!!!!|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	No problem with that it was a good play, the refs messed the game up for me. They didn't eject Harrison for punching a player on the ground and keep punching him after the flag was thrown.Missed the illegal block in the back at the 30 during Harrison's int return. Then, not reviewing the final play and also a dubious roughing the passer call on Arizona.     I don't support either team but was looking forward to a great game and the refs ruined it.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	I don't think many people are arguing is wasn't a catch, because it was.     I would rather see the proof that the last play of the game was NOT a forward pass...because that should have at LEAST been reviewed.|`|YhfMrppSaa	I dont need too. I seen the reply last night, still remembered.      Thanks, or no thanks|`|AA11749193	No- He had complete control of the ball and both feet hit the ground at the most crucial moment. I do wish Big Ben would've got MVP.     The play was reviewed, and it looked good, and I wasn't happy, but, hey, good for him.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	No...I need proof that Kurt Warner fumbled and didn't throw an incomplete pass at the end of the game...    And the question wasn't whether Holmes was in bounds...It was whether or not he should have been nailed with a 15 yard excessive celebration call...Obviously, he should have...|`|zAkeKg5Qaa	How is this an issue? In the age of HD, there was no doubt that his fee were down. The catch was a much easier call than reversing Rothlesberger's running TD in the 1st quarter.|`|q8mbICQ8aa	Did he have complete control?  Nothing we can do to change it now anyways so it doesn't matter what the call was.|`|AA11206135	Yeah for San "tippy toe"nio Holmes!
7SCOqUa8aa	yes, he was and he hit some big shots for them in the playoffs that year.. i think this may be the one objection i have with the spurs in that they got rid of jackson (or let him walk, i cant remember).. either way they should have found a way to keep him.. i always said bowen was highly overrated and i continually saw him miss open jumper after open jumper.. now, bowen isnt even starting and playing less and less minutes while jackson is still in his prime.. this sf position is one of the two positions that is a weakness for the spurs(the other being a legit big man opposite duncan) and it could have been solidified with jackson.. right now they could have parker, ginobli/finley (whichever one starts, the other comes off the bench), jackson, bonner, duncan.. it can be argued they would have won even more championships with jackson..|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	do you still respect stephen jackson?    cool just wondering|`|mG2BCZe7aa	He was on the Spurs team from 2001-2003. It was on the 2003 NBA Playoffs, Jackson earned his own ring as the Spurs 3rd leading scorer, averaging 12.8 points per game during the playoffs.      Hope this helps.
jwm0kQvNaa	yes, it was his knee.  if he'd really not been hurt, he would've cried the ball.  being as it was, he wasn't going to argue about it.  cause he's a p*ssy.|`|nDzenpkwaa	He wasn't...  He was used as a decoy for most of the game, which worked out great for Santonio Holmes!!!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	It was surely his knee, and the only reason he appeared at all was to get in there and make a couple of plays for the big game. I'm sure they pumped up his knee with cortizone and told him that he could only do a few plays or risk permanent lifelong injury.|`|BH05gFobaa	cardinals covered him well obviously|`|wbIEau0qaa	cause his was injured. and its not like he can outrun anyone|`|zOw22PDyaa	uh prob. cuz he wasnt open|`|lP9kQmRraa	Could've been his knee but I think it was the coverage scheme Arizona was utilizing.  Beside his first catch, I think he was double covered for most of the game.  Didn't really matter though, Santonio Holmes showed that he is a very talented receiver.|`|0db605dd532e7272be97e3e194768d82aa	Hines was not 100%, he had a hard time making cuts which he said after the game. Also, the Cards did a nice job covering him which allowed both Miller and Holmes to get open.|`|EVU0sFhBaa	well bcuase he cant run they used him as a decoy !!!|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	he's injured    he's also old and slow and past his prime    great receiver in his day but not the top receiver for the team anymore|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Cause Steelers had the game in the bag all along.|`|MaizmvvMaa	It's probably a combination of his knee, and ben is starting to have more trust in santonio. Holmes did come up to him as they went to the drive and said I want to be the guy that does this, I want to be the guy that wins this game.
VjMpfA2Yaa	the bald guy? hahaha...    well even as a Chivista I always think Reynoso blows. But for some reason he getting alot of points in the mediotiempo fantasy.    I dont know how Villaluz is in there, didnt he just start playing??    Pardo? hmm two yellows and the third game comes out with injury kinda crappy "welcome back" to Mexico.    and shouldnt the fowards be players that havent scored anything but are starters or have gotten playing time every game.....even though I agree that Landin will always be in the worst team selection ;-)|`|smeaQXafaa	pavel pardo is not supposed to be there!|`|8zgFyfibaa	I disagree pardo doesn't deserve to be in the list he played good so far.    I would add conejo perez|`|QcEcylBvaa	I disagree, and how did this became according to us? Did you did some poll or survey or something. This is according to YOU.    This will be me:  GK: Oscar "Conejo" Perez(Tigres)-(C)    DF: Jose "Gringo" Castro(Tigres)  DF: Darvin Chavez(Atlas)-(2 red cards in two games)  DF: Miguel Acosta(Puebla)  DF: Mario Perez(Necaxa)    MF: Rafael Medina(Tecos)  MF: German Villa(Necaxa)  MF: Antonio Sancho(Tigres)  MF: Dario Botinelli(Atlas)    FW: Giancarlo Maldonado(Atlante)  FW: Victor Piriz(Necaxa)    DT: Raul Arias    EDIT: I went through your account and I didn't found a single question that asked who were the worst. So you're lying and all this is based on your opinion.|`|MMTZuSY8aa	You are missing Drawin Chavez, he got 3 red cards this year. One in the InterLiga, Jornada 1 and Jornada 3.|`|xtmQ7vksaa	I really disagree with all the players you put up from Cruz Azul.. they've all been doing really well and Landin scored a goal way faster then he did with Morelia last season.    Probably the only ones i can agree with are Reynoso, De Pinho, and the bald guy.|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	why vera and pardo??..    seems like just another....anti-americanista huh??..    i would understand de pinho...|`|o2kW3eG0aa	lol you only answered according us haha|`|aNnmH3R4aa	HAHA....Funny how people put Villaluz when yet he hasn't even played 90mins in the whole season!!  I guess he is doing something right for people to hate him!!!    Other then that....I agree.      Landin is just garbage.  I'm still scratching my head on why Benja puts him in as a starter!!      The only reason he scored that last time was because it was a product of the work from Vela and Lugo!|`|b7IaDJVTaa	pavel pardo should be replace with ochoa from chivas.|`|7Xridrxaaa	what happened to Dante Lopez?? wtf he hasnt even scored! At least De Pinho and Landin scored. I am a Pumas fan but godamn Dante has sucked for us lately    HAHAHA@ THE BALD DEFENDER FROM PUEBLA THAT LOOKS LIKE CHELIS.
gPQLOPFDaa	I THINK IF I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE IT WOULD BE BETWEEN TWO OF THEM ENRIQUE ESQUEDA AND LANDIN THEY ARE BOTH GOOD PLAYERS BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE PLAYING GOOD THEY BOTH HAVE THERE GOOD GAMES AND THERE BAD GAMES JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PLAYER|`|3uOv4gOYaa	SANTI FERNANDEZ-----Nomas porque salio del America, que orgullo no????????|`|b7IaDJVTaa	pinho cuz he plays for america.|`|JYErVWsJaa	Luis Angel Landin  i have faith in him that he would wake up in cruz azul and become a goleador again|`|C3RCunFoaa	Esqueda anyday!|`|Epmny08zaa	depinho he sometimes plays good...i would not have the others.....cuzz "SON UNAS BURRAS PA JUGAR"...especially landin LOL|`|uSPxe2Bbaa	Either Landin or Esqueda. They both have a lot of determination and skill.|`|LAdeGGGFaa	Fonseca even though i am a Americanista.     But tell you the truth esqueda plays way much better as a midfielder then a striker.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	FCUK!! de esos ninguno....i rather play with no fowards! hahaha    I would put them ALL in a pot, melt them down, and make one out of all 5 players....aver si sale algo bueno.    but if i had to had to had tooooo.......Robert de Pinho (just cause of his international experience in europe)|`|QcEcylBvaa	Fonseca  He works hard and tries always.|`|wKnjGSU1aa	I would pick Esqueda, he's a real good player in my opinion, I don't think he's a bad player. He does some good assists, he moves around the field well, he's an alright player. That's just my opinion.|`|XSBNv0iOaa	Esqueda.  Even though he doesnt have any goals this season,I know he'll Explode with some in the middle of the season.  He just needs more Playing time.|`|sp80uzmLaa	Fonseca|`|xtmQ7vksaa	Probably Landin.. and im not kidding. Trust me, he's going to become a better player now that he's with Cruz Azul.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	hahahahahahah how bout none, well maybe only de pinho since he was the **** in europe,|`|GDL00jbIaa	none they all suck  u want good forwards look at chivas forwards    arellano  medina   ochoa|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	esqueda...    some times he plays like sht but there are times when u see him playin good...    knows how to move around and for some reason i see that esqueda understands cabanas mare than de pinho..    but de pinho is a better goal scorer than esqueda...esqueda has a great headers...but de pinho know how to finish goals better than esqueda...even tho he has just made 1 in the mexican league with america...
Bgpk4npBaa	they didnt screw up the game but they did call alot of unnesseary penalties and that made the  game boring in the first half they should and will be chewed out by the NFL for call so much BS  and there was 11 flags on the cards not 20 and there was a TOTAL of 18 penalties, you could call holding on ever play if you wanted to and they pracitaly did so thats not good at all|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Yes|`|0nWuiYy5aa	You hate to see the officiating be such a bigger-than-necessary part of a HUGE game like this, but it is what it is.  There was a lot of holding going on and some cheap shots that deserved personal fouls.  But overall, the officiating wasn't as bad as I've seen it and no one can blame the Cardinal's loss on the officiating.|`|c5FSGxxqaa	GO STEELERS!|`|AsvVWfiHaa	the refs are not going to be super, just because it's the super bowl.  they were the same refs that they've been all year long. they made mistakes like they always do....but not just on part of the cardinals.  i saw plenty of things go on that if called would've penalized the cards into 3rd and 20 situations...so please stop.  the game is over and the Steelers won.|`|AA10939368	Who thinks the Arizona fans are a bunch of whiners just like Seahawk fans?      Actually, the referees were pretty good yesterday, they called holding fairly evenly yesterday, offsides was even, they did not call either team for overcelebrating, and the unsportsmanlike penalties were what they are.  There is no denying those either way.    Considering there were three altercations yesterday, they handled it well.|`|mlAvI4CTaa	no one thinks the refs screwed up      refs had a perfect nite      steelers !!!      hahaha|`|BH05gFobaa	not totally, just that one drive  cardinals played weak in first half|`|qThmcR1Aaa	No game is officiated perfectly, and every losing team always has fans complaining about the officiating.    The refs didn't give up a 100-yard TD return, or throw a game-winning pass to Holmes. Bottom line, the Cards didn't get it done when they needed to.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	I am Australian and love aussie rules footy so watched the Superbowl to check out American football. What a load of crap. The whole thing is geared to the media and making money, the players were giving interviews the day before and having their biceps measured by bimbo girls. In Australia we take our footy very seriously and that sort of garbage would never happen. Not to mention your footy stops and starts, 15 minutes takes 40 minutes and you have a concert in the middle, again for money. Its all so American, the yanks don't know footy, or the business of footy, you all go over the top and make a mockery out of it just like everything else you do. Pathetic. And aussies footballers don't wear any padding.|`|uMTF3HXcaa	I think that the refs called every possible penalty they could have against the cardinals. The refs were terrible and the game was rigged.|`|0080cddfd4f4c4bb9ed2462f9f69e09aaa	The refs in the game were not that bad. If you look at every foul that they called, the only questionable one was the roughing the passer they called on the Cardinals. Even though I am a Steelers fan, I will admit that both the Steelers and Cardinals gave up big penalties that all got the fouls they deserved, like Harrison pushing the Cardinal player. But when it came down to it the Steelers were able to make the big plays when it counted. Everyone should just quit blaming the game on the referees because they did a very good job, and just admit that both the Steelers and the Cardinals played a great game!!|`|jrRpaQEeaa	I think so. They SUCKED! Cards prolly could have one it if it wasent for the refs.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Who thinks Cards fans are cry babies?|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	no. you cards are just complete cry babies cuz you guys lost!  DEAL WITH IT!|`|9XCL2ElKaa	I don't understand how 20 yellow flags were thrown against the Cards. i think that some of the refs were biased.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	Notice how all the Steelers' fans are saying the refs were "perfect?" It's because they're too blind to see all the atrocious penalties their precious team got away with!     Like all those fights the Steelers kept instigating? Only ONE TIME was it actually penalized!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not me. Congratulations Steelers on the Six Pack.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Yes harrison should have been ejected he will get a fine. that's was a horrible display of fair football. if you look at the replay the line judge  was looking right at harrison when he did that too. poor officiating. I thought that wipeout was more fair and more entertaining .|`|dfo8gSaraa	I don't.    There were bad calls on BOTH sides of the ball. But, I've seen much worse officiating than yesterday.|`|MaizmvvMaa	NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira confirmed that Kurt Warner fumbled on the Cardinals' last play of the Super Bowl.  Announcer Al Michaels claimed there was a quick booth review at the end and Pereira confirmed that as well. Neither Warner nor head coach Ken Whisenhunt believed there was a review and both were quite miffed about it after the game. The odds of a Hail Mary touchdown were incredibility slim, but Pereira's confirmation about the review and the fumble at least offer some closure to an epic game.
a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	they don't get stuck.  you do not feel them, unless you do not keep them clean and change them out as prescribed.    if you sleep in them (even extended wear lenses), you will wake up with them being cloudy, and you will have "eye boogers" in the corners of your eyes.    if you do not clean them, wear new ones when you are supposed to (change them out), then you can cause great damage to the inside of your eyelid and the eyeball itself.    your ophthalmologist or optometrist can inform you of everything you need to know.|`|RCXPgmfSaa	it really depends on each individual's eyes  how much water they produce etcetc  like the tears and stuff    cuz i can sleep with mine fine :P|`|oNchHZIlaa	they can get stuck if they are really dry but they only really dry out for me is when i wear them to sleep. leading me the other question. there is only one brand out there that i know of that you can sleep with them on, otherwise you have to take them off but if you take a nap or anything like that you will be fine.   and some people do accidently wear them when they sleep and nothing really bad happens, they just dry out a lot.   after a while you wont even feel them. i love my contacts way better than my glasses. although the first time i had to put them in it took me like two doctors visits to get the hang of it.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	contacts are really comfortable and after u get used to them u cant even feel them. acuvue oaysis is the best because it doesnt dry out and theyre very comfortable. i wear mine during practice and i do just fine. u r not supposed to sleep with contacts unless they r the overnite kinds. u can take short naps, but it is better for ur eyes to have them out while u sleep.|`|MXpW48lFaa	They can get a little hard to get off if they're dry, I personally don't feel much wearing mine because they're soft and just sit on my eye, at first it WILL feel a little or a lot awkward, but they're fine. I wouldn't sleep in them though, take them out when you got to bed and put them in when you get up. If you want more information you should check it out with your Optomitrist :)    Hope things go well :D|`|tQsxsuNPaa	These are questions you should be asking your contact lens practitioner...optician.    And why under swimming and diving?  YOU CAN NOT WEAR THEM IN THE POOL!!!  YOU WILL BURN THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR EYES!  I can't wear them for hours after a long swim.
AA12139293	I was because so many of them I'd seen before.  What happened to premiering NEW commercials for the Super Bowl?  Oh, and that Pepsi Max commercial?  Give me a break.|`|EVU0sFhBaa	i hated thm they suked all but the doritos and palamalou!|`|MUgs8tKoaa	i was, but the companies didn't want to spend so much money because of the economy.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	I cringe at nearly all of them.  Have for years now.  I think they are trying to hard.|`|Jn6r9Lx3aa	Very dissapointed not great example for children and let me say last year was appropriate,funny, and enjoyable very dissapointed.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	I reckon!!!!!  Enough with the Doritos already...Geez.|`|TRPqdDTLaa	They could of put more effort into most of them|`|s25Dh5RVaa	They were lame.

AA11559902	In my humble opinion......    Kobe is an a**...........  :)  Ridiculously bad character - but a good b-ball player, I don't dispute that. I give credit where credit's due - and call an a** like I see 'em lol :)    Who do you like for college b-ball, Derek?|`|JD5NQxeNaa	No it's an internet glitch on a nationwide/worldwide scale. WTF do you think. Sorry, I am just venting after this tough loss.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Whoa! Kobe is still crap!  Lakers suck!  Go Celtics&Suns!|`|NEtVRjplaa	Yeah he did. At halftime the Lakers had 65 points and Kobe had 34 of them! It was great game.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I love how the Knicks fans started chanting MVP for Kobe...haha thats pathetic to be a Knick fan!!|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	haha don't get too over excited.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Yea|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Yeah this question has been asked about 80% of the time the past hour. Kobe definitely went off if he got 61, don't you think?|`|2OoSK35xaa	Im sure Kobe got off (thats what they said in colorado)    Yea, 61 points, 20-20 from the charity stripe, and Pau Gasol put in 31 and didn't even garner a mention.|`|tnqO91xoaa	Yes he did      he was unstoppable         GO LAKERS!!!!!!!|`|LdIgg7yTaa	Ditto to what GsW said.|`|nz220kO4aa	Yes he did. it was a great show to watch.|`|nynlxGmNaa	thats what happen when stars play at the world most famous arena
BxsWYt2qaa	yes it will suck but ted and cody will come out and Procter orton from undertakers choke hold|`|nzKo4TFvaa	yes Muhammed Hassan is going to DQ|`|JiCfYfLraa	yes it would the wwe always do that and that pisses me off why cant they have a winner. but you already know thats gonna happen. legacy is gonna interfere and get in the match attacking undertaker and then its gonna be a dq so predictable.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Yes it will suck..|`|77uc2xXUaa	It will end in DQ, guaranteed.  They won't give that good of a match unless its on PPV, trust me.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Yes! So many good potentialatches end in da nowadays for instance cena vs edge. I will be very upset if there is a dq.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	It will end in DQ. Just watch, Taker will have Orton in the hell's gate and then Dibiase and Rhodes will interfere and beat the living cr@p out of Taker. It's way too predictable if you ask me.|`|CK8oRi9faa	you know that taker will win with that choke hold
gz2M5hsBaa	That's not a Hat-trick. It needs to happen in the same match.    It would be good to see him get it, just for the sake of it.|`|mZ2Uluioaa	It is counted as hat trick technically but i'm sorry to say , it is impossible for him to achieve this as he is now only good enough for tailenders~    omg, ronny's account is suspended for abuse to MBTM~|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Very doubtful. The indian batsmen are able to read him well, even the lower range batsmen like Sharma & Zahir.|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	No it will not count. As MBTM said, batsmen are now starting to pick Mendis and soon they will be hitting him around at ease. Similar to Paul Adams with his weird bowling action.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	It can only be a hatric if he took the 3wickets in the same match.. Unfortunately for mendis it wont be termed a hatric if he gets a wicket of his 1st delivery today|`|a7OKLGQjaa	His strike rate in ODIs is (balls per wicket) is 19.    That means he takes a wicket every 19 balls.    Hence the probability of his hat-trick is 5%.|`|r0HYuHubaa	your guess is as good as any1s|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Mendis will get his Hat-trick~      cheers|`|ocPlxCIeaa	no he will never get it,    There Is No More Mystery In Mendis.  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I don't know whether that counts,does it?|`|AA11088802	no|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|t7uuzjfHaa	A hat-trick can never involve more than two innings because it can only be achieved within ONE  MATCH.   ---for Test matches    In ODIs  a  hat trick  can never involve more  than 1 inning.        The chances of Mendis taking a wicket off his first ball  are 20% .   So,I think, no .|`|b9C8CKo1aa	He can do it...But only if his first over of the match is going to be Indias Last over....;)|`|Mfi84xBQaa	This can't be a Hat-Trick , Man $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
xryhIM8Saa	I agree its priceless just hold on to it man|`|FTHiD6tMaa	well i dont know about a hat but look at this    http://www.sportsmemorabilia.com/sports-...    if the jersey is worth that much than the hat would be worth a litttle less but still a Lot hope i helped...!|`|aGNjZmyJaa	At least a grand.|`|HOtYR1ksaa	It's priceless.|`|NzS7yD32aa	A lot!!!!!!!!!!    I will keep it if i were you     a future Hall of Famer
H7AcXAyaaa	LeBron James in 2010 because he would want to play with Stuckey.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	LeBron James has a better chance of the two, but neither will be coming to Detroit. I 100% guarantee it. I think both are very content with their situations.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Neither|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Neither they will stay. Although, I think Amar'e will go to the Pistons.|`|3teWTOPqaa	LeBron James, because Kobe isn't leaving the Lakers. Although I don't think either will go to Detroit.
1GpHnVHwaa	The reason why Ortiz went to Atlante was because Atlante thought Vilar was leaving to Europe or Argentina..But I bet you now El Gato is regreting that dumb move. He is like 33 or 34 years old already poor guy he should've gone to Atlas because they really need a better goalie.|`|kPbou3Vdaa	It had to be an Argentine to take away a Mexican's spot.|`|pMzq6B3paa	CHIVAS!!!!!!!!!|`|CeiIz1Vbaa	No, Federico Vilar is still the GK|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Was he the dude from Jaguares??  I really dont know|`|A2puqgbTaa	I had have Vilar then that maleta|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	my question is why el Gato ortiz agreed to go to Atlante!?!?!    why go to a team that already has a starting goolie that is never going to get the bench....
e5c347190016113ac012b8aa79ed41aeaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!    That is cruelty to animals even if they are pests.  It is irresponsible what you are wanting to do.|`|wKdQqh4Faa	Umm you should if you would like to have fun. In my opinion i would, just dont kill the animal because you could get fined or sued O_O|`|WXjvWLNraa	sure, make sure it isn't shooting to fast though.
LIKkt8djaa	Well the gashes could be repaired with p-tex and epoxy depending on how bad they are, and the edges I'm pretty sure they can use epoxy for that to depending upon how bad it is, pics would really clear it up. But generally if the edges are literally coming off the board it's time for a new one, something I've learned is that park boards are meant to get beat up. You're better off not worrying about beating up your board so you can just enjoy the ride.|`|Cxr2fSAlaa	take it to a shop to be prepared if you are thinking of getting rid of it should it with a paintball gun and I was kidding about the shooting animals with a paintball gun.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Yea I would say so...If there are any open places that are too big to fix with epoxy then they will retain water and eventually ruin your board.  Browse around at the new boards, you'd be surprised at what the new boards come with so as not to mess up your board so quickly.
mFz4sdUjaa	What part of MEXICO HASNT WON IN THE USA IN THE LAST 10 YEARS do mexico fans not get?|`|HVE2kX6Raa	I like the fact that you are a US fan, but Landon at left wing??? Never gonna happen and should never happen. He is our Attacking midfielder and orchestrates our whole offense. If we need goals, he goes to striker otherwise he sets up the offense. The starting 11 should be:    RB: Cherundolo (He has been playing for Hannover and appears to be fine)    CB: Bocanegra and Onyewu    LB: Pierce (I don't like him, but I would take him over Wynne. He is faster and has more experience)    LM: Beasley (Still the best option at LM and one of the best attackers for the US.    CM: Bradley    RM: Sacha    RAM: Landon    LAM: Dempsey    ST: Ching    Bench: Guzan, Altidore, Adu, Hejduk, Convey (I know Bobby won't make it, but I would love to see him get back in the US lineup).    Even the most diehard mexican fan would have to be weary of this lineup. Especially when they're without a lot of their top talent.|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha i'll challange your formation. I think Landon will play below Ching(although i think Altidore will start) like the US always do ( a pus$y as formation by the US like always) and Frankie Hejduk should start. I am not Sven but this is how i would field my team    ------------------Vuoso  -------------------------------Nery Castillo    Martinez---Leandro---Pardo---------- Zinha    Pinto----Salcido---Marquez--- Osorio|`|LAdeGGGFaa	Mexico starting line up i believe is going to be  ----------Sanchez--------  Osorio-Marquez-Galindo-Salcido  ------Pardo-----Leandro------  Medina--------------------Sinha----  ---------------Nery-------------------...  -------------Vouso--------------------...    4-4-1 for sven line up.|`|QcEcylBvaa	Who cares who US is gonna use, we gonna win 5-0.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	no one cares in this section mr. darko, u should just post this in your french section...no offence this is the mEXican football section no?      and player by player we have better talent...nuff said.|`|8zgFyfibaa	Like ticallion said go ask in the  french section. It don't matter we all know the usa will play defense and counter attack.      Who cares who they put we will win     I never loose hope in el tri.|`|t0QsKaQ7aa	i'd like to hear your insights. Because you blow up your players way too much. I give it to you, Gooch is a good defender. Strong header and  great physic. Maybe not so good against players with quick feet, but i like him from the USMNST. Howard? Egh. Get of your knees with him.    Most logical line up,    ___________Sanchez__________  Osorio, Marquez, Galindo, Salcido  ______Pardo_____Leandro______  Zinha__________________Medina  _____Castillo_____Ochoa_______      Now let me give you your comparison,  The defense is Mexico hands down, individually of course. Marquez, no one on the USMNST comes close to his caliber of play. 6 Years in Barcelona and one of Guardiola's most trusted men. Bocanegra is good, but the teams he has played in come no where near Barcelona. Gooch, he still stuck in Belgium. Two players of experience compared to Mexico's 4 defenders of experience will easily handle the pressure. The midfield, I know Donovan will not be there. He is an attacking player, so he will be the attacking midfielder. Pavel Pardo and Zinha are the two players of experience. If Ramon Morales was there, he would be a great addition and would send in balls from the wing with such ease. But Dempsey is a good player, will cause problems for Mexico.    The attack, the game will be won in the midfield, not the attack. That's all there is.|`|DBQRLygoaa	Thats all gravy but I dont understand why you must come here.. to mexican section to talk about your usa team. Makes no sense.. I come here looking for mexican news etc and always see people asking about usa, am i in wrong section!?!|`|C3RCunFoaa	As much as i don't like Oswaldo Sanchez Sven is going to start him.    -----------------Sanchez--------------...    Osorio-Marquez-Galindo-Salcido    ---------Pardo--------Augusto---------  ------------------Sinha---------------...    -----Castillo-------------Medina------...  -----------------Vuoso----------------...        This is the most logical, considering the Form of the players.

Remember when he scored 81 points...he only had 6 rebounds and 2 assists. Devin Harris for Most improved player! Danny Granger for MVP! (One day)|`|okECVBkzaa	To have zero rebounds is kind of odd. You would think at least one would bounce his way. I didnt see the game, so I dont know how things went, but it makes sense he'd score 60+ tonight.

If they ever saw any other driver break any driving laws, they would encourage other drivers to stick the red card at them. The whole goal was to embarrass the violator for breaking the law by having multiple drivers show the red cards at them.|`|ainRE0abaa	yeah.  except.  i wouldnt like them to do it to me.  cuz i wouldnt even be able to get two words out before i got red carded.|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	i love that idea. i'm going to do it at work tomorrow.|`|tZIPhjPHaa	Substitute "Guillotine" for Red Card and "Flog" for yellow card and I'm there.|`|TlcMyJeuaa	You know, you don't have to wish for this, you can actually do it.  You'll look like a complete dumbass, but really that's the only thing stopping you.|`|VSRyCQyVaa	I do that, but I use physical violence instead.    If I slap them, that is the equivalent of a yellow card...if I punch them, that's the red card.|`|ecFd7gVdaa	I'll just throw a yellow flag when someone offend me.
f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	What?  Fitzgerald is awesome, indeed, but the Steelers defense (including Polamalu) kept him at bay for most of the game.      Come on...The reason Fitzgerald didn't score more than he did is because Polamalu had him covered.      You know.....here in Steelers country, I've heard NOTHING BUT RESPECT for the Cardinals and the tremendous fight they gave us.  Sure, BEFORE the game there's a lot of talking smack, that's just how it goes.  It's all in fun.  But you don't get to the SB without being one hell of a team, and that goes for both the Cardinals AND the Steelers.      The biggest factor in the game (in my humble opinion) were the penalties.  The Steelers had 7 penalties for -56 yards vs the Cardinals'  11 for -106 yards.  Looking at other stats, the penalites seem to have been the Cardinals' biggest obsticle.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	Exactly.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Fitz is too big, too strong and too fast, he's got great hands too.     He also has a 39 in. vertical leap.    Killer combo for a WR isn't it?|`|XaFYUMRSaa	I'm not sure, but I really don't think he's cares they got the win.|`|4kdlE54Paa	Larry Fitzgerald runs great routes and has great break away speed.  He is really hard to catch after he gets that stride going.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Because Fitz is the best receiver in the league, and the Steelers aren't up to speed yet with techniques to cover him. Or try to anyway. Congrats Steelers on your sixth trophy!|`|Z9uZ98Msaa	who cares  Fitzgerald is just that good|`|H0LfFGmlaa	In case you haven't noticed no one can stop Fitzgerald. Did you see the one catch he had in the end zone? He's probably the only guy in the NFL that can make a catch like that.|`|lK6S5cGSaa	Because Fitzgerald's vertical is higher than everyone on the Steeler's defense combined.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Troy and Ike Taylor kept Fitzgerald out of the end zone the entire first half.  Because he is a tremendous player, it was inevitable that he would do something big at some point.      Regardelss of stats, the final score does not lie.|`|AA10939368	They contained him for three quarters, so they did a pretty good job of it.  The last touchdown was made because the Steelers changed their defense and Arizona was holding, not called mind you.  I do not think he really cares either, they won the superbowl. That is like saying why did Arizona allow Holmes to make the game winning touchdown pass.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Basically they are playing cover 2 defense which  literally means he is not on him one on one(Ike Taylor and Deshea Townsend were those CB's) and also at times they have safety blitzes which was part of their sheme.    In the Catch and Run for a TD by Fitz, It was a cover 2 but slightly Troy moved to the slot receiver which Fitz saw and ran for a TD..Their cover 2 stop Fitz in the first half but Arizona adjust to it and was successfully reading the defenses, I say it was also good judgement on Kurt Warner part.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Fitz is unstoppable.  Not even Polamalu can keep up with that beast.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	The stats don't lie, but they don't show the whole picture either.    Fitzgerald had 1 catch through the first 3 quarters.    Polamalu and the rest of the Steelers defense wore down in the 4th, but the Cardinals defense wore down as well.|`|YTYjzGAXaa	ummm    Did Asante Samuels and Brian Dawkins stop him? Nuff said...|`|osI8T5rMaa	His one of the best receiver in NFL nobody can stop him and no one can jump and catch the way he did ,his good yes,but then Palomalu and the rest of the steelers doesnt care they're the champion not Fitz team.|`|JwWLcBlpaa	BECAUSE THE MAN IS NOT HUMAN !!!!!!!!!! LOL    I THINK HES THE BEST RECIVER BECAUSE TROY CAN STOP EVERY BODY ALSE|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	The defense stopped Fitzy for 3 quarters, they relaxed a little bit early but at the end forced the winning fumble when it mattered.    Troy kept smashing Fitz the entire game.|`|FBdj61JFaa	The reason is because the steelers played polamalu wrong... he is not the deep centerfield-like safety ed reed is, instead he is a more physical tackler. Since The steelers played a prevent Defense a majority of the night, and Fitzgerald is god-like, Polamalu just got burned.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	Because Fitzgerald is black.    and Palomalu isn't as black.|`|eKsgL2wkaa	Dont know. I couldnt figure out why they just didnt keep going to Fitzgerald more.
0viBGF9vaa	No the pats werent, honestly the Dolphins definatly deserved it, they came from a 1-16 season and beat out two really good teams to win their division. Steelers were the best this year though, they deserved the title. I wanted the eagles to go though|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No.|`|7RziqsDcaa	I know, it was BS that the Bears didn't make it. Oh well, the best team will now have to wait untill next year..|`|kurVssmbaa	they were one of the top teams going into this year but without brady they weren't as good as the dolphins or raven. they are a lock for the afc east w/ brady. just remember who outplayed them twice last year.

B6dQzaGyaa	Kimbo could never get in the ring/octagon/street with a true MMA fighter unless it was a pure boxing match vs an BJJ fighter, Kimbo had all his opponents hand picked for him so that he would win, well that didnt work out to well even when he met an average MMA fighter.    Kimbo may be the baddest "street boxer" out there, but he has no submission defense, not enough cardio to go 3 full rounds, and very little real wrestling skills, he has a big punch and moderately decent chin, but you put him up against any fighter on an elite MMA level from 185lbs up and he gets owned, even if he has 40lbs on them    However you put Cote in the "street boxing" rules that you can only stand up and no knees, and all Kimbos boys to protect their cash cow and he would probably win...any other scenario and its over|`|eSvi5IDPaa	Patrick Cote would kill him.    Come on KImbo knocked Kimbo out with a Jab.    KImbo's wins are Ray Mercer who in hes 50's.Tank Abbott who is just a can and in hes 40's also a alcholic.James Thompson which was stopped to early.    In hes street fights he fought guys that were 20-30 pounds lighter than him and had no fight training and he cheated in some fights like when hes team breaks it up when he starts losing and when Kimbo tackles ppl in street boxing matchs.    Kimbo is a dirty cheater and will die against Cote.    but you know Kimbo is a Heavyweight and Cote is a MIdlleweight.|`|rOv1wowLaa	cote is too expirenced if kimbo trained in other martial arts besides being a slugger he could be good but cote would destroy him if it was a fair fight
HtsowwHBaa	one thing for sure, liverpool now stuck with just tores for the rest of the season and that mean only one formation to fit, one man up front. no room to be creative and be flexible in there. once teams found out how to kill toress and stop the supply to him u guys r screwed. no plan B.|`|HEEXkiihaa	dont forget rafa wanted to get rid of alonso for barry...anyway rafa sux and parry too|`|WzSwdv3zaa	rafa bought reaira and all in all it was a decent buy       parry buys keane and well now he's gone      theres a reason why the manager should be the ONLY one who decides who to buy|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	3 world class midfielders??    try 1 and it's not Gerrard.|`|ujRVh1e4aa	I for one, do not believe Parry was the correct one in the situation. I was also not sure if they needed Gareth Barry at the time, with Gerrard and Alonso having a well known partnership in the center of the field. But I feel like it was a good descion to go for Riera only because Ryan Babel is still young. He still has alot to learn and the thing that liverpool were missing all of last season was the crossing, i for one that it was disgraceful, riera brings the crossing and the good penetration past a right back, hes done it past wes brown, Jose Bosingwa, and Sagna this year, i think that was a great move. When i first heard of the keane deal i was scared very very scared. I didn't think it was gonna work i realized from the beggining that this could be a problem because Fernando Torres is the lone striker type of guy, he likes to get past the defense get through balls have much space around him, but with RObbie keane next to him he didn't have alot of space to operate and the main problem between the too was that they both wanted to score, i think Robbie should have been more of the passer, but that wasnt the case. Now with Keane gone i think Rafa is in somewhat of a pickle, he defended keane for so long without possibly thinking of a replacement if the irishman left, personally i felt that saviola of real madrid would have been a great option, and would communicate very well with Torres (they being both spanish). Now if Torres gets injured, i believe Dirk Kuyt will move up but N'gog as his back up?
eDCyle05aa	I would pick Frank Gore because Dallas starting RBs haven't done real good for the last couple of years.|`|huHOpRLLaa	marrion barber  cuz he sexy   hehe  = )|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	They're both good. I'd probably take Barber because Gore has had more injury and fumbling problems, but Gore is more explosive.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	Frank gore.    Definitely,    at least he has had some decent years.    Marion barber just sucks.    check the stats.      plus,    Frank gore has had a bad O-line/ overall bad team his entire career.    As much as I hate the cowboys, the do have a a lot of talent on their team.|`|kBf7OUXNaa	I have to agree with the people above me.    The Cowboys are a passing team with T.O [Terrell Owens].  and Miles Austen, Jason Witten. And you got Tony Romo Throwing the ball. What more could you ask for. and only run the ball in clutch situations    And the 49ers, well dont a good QB. and Mike Singletary likes to run the ball mainly. He plays with the running game.    therefore more yardage for Gore.|`|SoyiS9IKaa	They both are tough and run hard.  They run at the D instead of running away.  Instead of running out of bounds they usually try to stay in and hit someone.  Im a NINERS fan so I've got to go with Gore.
W0IqNBRUaa	yeah if he worked on his conditioning and didnt slack.   he looks really out of shape. i dunno about being outclassed. gsp is really good and shud never be underestimated.    and btw there is always a allegations against gsp for penn fans!|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Theres a better chance of it snowing in hell:)|`|ffh5mTViaa	Yes, he could have BUT...  1)he did not train as hard as GSP  2)his gameplan did not consider GSPs weight advantage  3)his training camp pales considerably to the Jackson camp (fire yer bro)  4)his ego refuses to let him recognize 1,2 and 3    but seriously it was the vaseline steroid substance that was rubbed on GSP that was the deciding factor;)|`|gGodoQEjaa	No i bet 500 on GSP|`|UqUqU9ceaa	gsps trainers got caught rubbing Vaseline all over gsps back so there in trouble for that right now did you even notice why bjs legs were slipping down his back when he was trying to get high guard its because gsp had vaseline all over his back|`|AA11517536	Yes, BJ would've had a chance if he had actually trained for the fight.  Instead, he was too busy chillin' on the beaches of Hawaii.    Can't say that I blame him actually...    He also needs a real camp.  Right now, he's just surrounded by yes-men who worship him.|`|b0faTDlJaa	Yes there was a chance i gave him about a 10% chance of  beating GSP.You wanna see something funny, watch how all the Bj fans desperately look for excuses as to why Bj got owned. It was very obvious to me what would happen. But Bj in his own mind thought he could walk up to GSPs territory and take his belt...then he woke up lol.
4OCcsDeTaa	taker passes the torch all the time. he even wanted to put orton over and have him win at mania 21 but orton refused out of respect. their wont be a clear winner for this match. you know how wwe is|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Ahhm i do know Undertaker gpin to win undertake Hopefully but i dont thin ortan is becomin NWC i think this becuase randy orton is aioming for legends n he likes to kick ppl|`|NRs72Afxaa	Undertaker will make Ortan look good for his World Title run I'll say that, but I don't think it'll be a clean finish.|`|AA10691319	dude back off the crack, taker isnt going to drop to orton.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Next week Undertaker will make Orton look good... however.. by the end Undertaker will be dominating.. and the Legacy will interfere and Kane will come to help xD That's what I think.. and hey I was right about there being a no hold barred match between Orton and Shane..|`|aULZ8D10aa	I hope orton wins, but he will beat cena for the title.

3teWTOPqaa	lol let's not get ahead of ourselves and keep the eyes on the big trophy instead. Kobe has the potential to prove how valuable he really is with Bynum out and next week there will be two big tests for Kobe and the Lakers, so we will see.    Lakers in 09'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    EDIT: Iverson, do you know what's ironic about a A.I fan calling anyone a ballhog?|`|xhHfXuKFaa	at this rate it can go either way...|`|mSFjbetxaa	I think it is too tough to call at this point.|`|0PbYE3M7aa	Kobe just put up the most points ever against the Knicks.|`|MPz9APZDaa	Yeah, another MVP wouldn't be bad, but as MC said we need to keep the eye on the prize.     To AI and MC, Kobe is ball hog? Oh boy, another jealous person. Did you see Iverson chuck up all those shots and miss a lot of them vs the Cavs on Sunday? Think again...!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	LeBron will Win MVP.|`|nynlxGmNaa	kobe mvp|`|stdjB5n8aa	kobe back-to-back ball hog award    sorry iverson not a ball not even near a ball hog|`|tl7fd34yaa	stop being such a prisoner of the moment, relax Lebron will still win the MVP|`|gaNDR31Taa	well remember that in those times when kobe was without gasol and a good bynun, he was a huge scorer (remember the 81 point game?). People thought that bryant would win the mvp award but did not win it for 2 years until he won it in 2008. LeBron is on a winning team and kobe is on a winning team. Depending on whoever steps up, they will become the mvp. The mvp award is another award. The finals mvp award is a different story.|`|Y3PKA2Wvaa	and BACK TO BACK failure to win a championship|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	lebron is playing great but people was calling him the mvp 10 gms into the season that's just crazy ,that said now that bynums out kobe will take it to another level and win his 2nd mvp.
w9kSGLBxaa	The NSAC is launching an investigation. It appears he was greased but they are not pointing the finger at George...yet. The evidence is clear. He was greased. I do not think it would have changed the out come of the fight. Cheating is cheating and some one needs to get there @rse in to deep shite because of it.      edit...wow, i am sorry. I completely misread your question, sorry. I do not think he did againt Serra|`|xY9eumpTaa	Hi did, GSP was always known for greasing before fights and all of Greg Jackson's fighters are known for it.    It may not seem that it played a big factor here, but BJ's strategy for the fight was to use a high guard and a rubber guard to control GSP until he could find a sweep.  You can see that BJ's legs slipped off whenever he went for a high guard.  Not saying he would have won, but the fight would have been very different.    Also, those who think the grease was "wiped off" were confused.  You grease up well before the fight and let it sink in, usually w/ something like ben gay that will start to ooze back out of your skin when you start to sweat.  The reason Nurse was putting vaseline on during the fight was to cover the skin and make GSP sweat more... if a little didn't get wiped off then that's even better.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Possibly, but not enough to cause a difference in the outcome.  It's the same with BJ.  GSP was slightly greased down, but not enough to change the outcome.      I don't think Serra or Penn should fight GSP again.  Either of them would lose.  Grease of no grease.|`|65PS8shGaa	no all of this contriversy is bs. he completely destroyed serra and bj|`|cj8iM1Olaa	HE didn't grease anything. His cornerman are the ones who would have done the greasing.    And even if he was greased against BJ, the NSAC toweled him down in between rounds.
Wq4ASMktaa	Remington has an AWESOME little program on their site that you can download for free - it gives you the exact bullet drop for every centerfire cartridge that they make, and it tells you where you should be aiming if the if the target range and zero range are different distances.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	I have done this before as well. I would tell you that I have a nikon bdc scope and this has a dot system for my scope to show where to put the dot at 200, 300, 400, 500 even. If you go to nikon's website you can look through this scope and it will help you see the distance up you will have to move. Just based on memory I would say for 200 it is less the half a centimeter with my .270. I will get you the link.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I bought a Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14 scope with the BDC reticle and put it on my 338 win mag.  It's almost not fair how well that thing works.  We have a 1000 yard range, and it is almost cheating how easy it is to ring the 500 yard gong.  Nikon does a really good job explaining this reticle on their website.  It is so much easier than just holding over and hoping.|`|TvARYVRJaa	yes you can,,, big target   hgth. wise ok thanks  and good back stop as you know the hold over
A5zTi1tWaa	I like him, he can be the character that energizes a team. He won't fit well in a system that requires discipline, patience and movement though.     He's a run and gun player so he could only fit in GS, Denver probably(Billups could make him even better), and LAC with B-Diddy.    But what I wanna see him being in Detroit, just fits the Tough Boy type but that is a tough system for him.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Best player on the Warriors and I feel sorry for him! He did not have a problem w/ Pop he was young got a ring and did not know how hard it was to get another, so he left to Atlanta for more $.|`|7SCOqUa8aa	i think he is a very good player that is an above average starter in the league.. if he ever plays on a really good team, he may even make an all star team one day.. the one negative on him was his emotions and staying focues but that worry seems to have wavered for he is now looked upon as a leader of the warriors ... i like watching him play-he can do everything from shoot, pass, and rebound..|`|eTUEAWO9aa	hes decent. hes a starter type of guy, but not an allstar|`|mSFjbetxaa	He had a problem with Pop, so Pop traded him.  I think he is consistant, and that is necessary in the NBA.|`|zRoDeilLaa	Kobe > Jordan        MICHAEL JORDAN SUCKS!!!|`|Jsvz996Baa	he is good my auntie loves him she calls herself ms.jackson|`|HHqE8xzJaa	Hes a dirty.. ugly player...

ALL DA WAY|`|OzDVtamDaa	Leborn James. Kobe and Lebron can shoot as good as each other. both average near 30ppg but lebron can also average 7assist and 8 rebounds a game. Plus the main thing is they are pretty much can go toe to toe with each other but Kobe probaly can only do it 5 more years while Lebon have 15.      Plus they are both legends.but wouldnt you have a 24year old legen than a 31 year old one

Matt's been more loyal to the company (been in WWE since '98; didn't defect to TNA like his brother)...and yet they reward Jeff with the top title while Matt is stuck on the crappy "ECW" brand.

He was excellent with guy who did the play-by-play both for football comments and just because he happens to be a funny guy.  He should never have left the broadcast booth.  The ability to talk football and eat brats is in his blood.  Planning the roster for a professional team was beyond his skill sets.|`|a6EndAPiaa	Yes his is immanently qualified.  He was the president of an NFL team.  Just how many people do you think have held that post?  Just because he did a bad job as a president does not mean that he does not have anything worthwhile to say.    At least you can clearly understand him when he speaks (yes I am talking about you Shannon Sharpe).  I would much rather hear Millen than Sharpe.    Yes I would rather hear analysis from Charlie Casserly or Bobby Bethard because they are much more knowledgeable but there are many less knowledgeable folks who give us opinions on the NFL on TV than Millen.|`|dfo8gSaraa	I agree.

What makes him qualified to give analysis and opinions about football........he's never played or coached    LOL I'm definitely not a Millen supporter but I DO get tired of people acting like he's the worst thing to happen to football......when in actuality those same people don't know their facts.....and if you don't know your facts you don't have a solid argument so yea.....|`|qjCl8paPaa	well he has experienced something no other gm has|`|3692ob2daa	hahhaha i was thinkin about the same thing
ltqUpAKhaa	Two choices here.  Given the fact that they had bouts a week apart, a unification bout with Andre Berto makes a lot of sense right now as a big summer fight.  Also, the fact that this bout was already close to happening at the end of last year makes this a fight worth making.  Berto is finished fighting tuneups (at least it looks like that way) after his victory over Collazo.  This is the next logical step for him, as he needs to fight a champion like Mosley if he really wants to show he is ready to take over the 147 division. And this will also be good for Mosley to show that he is still the same man who takes on anybody who challenges him, as he always has. The only problem with this is that Berto may end up rematching Collazo, as their fight was so close.  If anybody was able to watch this fight, I wont go so far as to say Collazo could have won a decision, but it maybe could have been called a draw. So both men may agree to rematch. This would leave Mosley to fight.....    Josh Clottey.  This fight makes perfect sense right now.  Clottey has been idle since busting Zab Judah, and scrambling to find an opponent. With Mosley getting rid of Margarito, there is nobody really left for Clottey to fight.  Berto may not be ready for a fighter like Clottey, whereas a seasoned veteran champion like Mosley would be much more comfortable fighting in such a tough, ultra-physical type of fight.  Furthermore, there is arguably nobody better in the division right now who could possibly make a fight with Mosley as early as this summer, as Cotto and Margarito are tied up til at least late fall.     *Floyd Mayweather, if he returns, is looking to fight the winner of Pacquiao - Hatton, which takes these 3 fighters out of the mix for summer.      *Paul Williams has basically been ruled out by Mosley.|`|Limt9t5Qaa	He is from the Golden Boy stable so he will probably fight some other welter from that same stable so that Oscar can cash in on the promoting fees. If you study other cards from GBP they always fight each other and Oscar just gets richer and richer. More than likely it will be some poor bastard that is up and coming and not fit to fight Mosley. Either that or Mosley will demand to fight top guys so he can unify...but that's not too likely.|`|rhgVEXkDaa	4 possible opponents    Floyd Mayweather Jr.  Miguel cotto  Manny Pacquiao  Ricky Hatton|`|R0J1W3BCaa	Not Floyd "Money" Mayweather if his old *** wants to keeps his belt. HA HA HA HA HA HA|`|jY6cis4Kaa	Either the Hatton-Pacquiao winner or maybe Miguel Cotto in a rematch. Mosley has admitted to not wanting to fight Paul Williams because of his size. He could possibly give Andre Berto a shot.|`|9ANVqDNGaa	Cotto will most likely be his first title defense. It would set up an obvious rematch and their first fight was close, if Cotto had not won the last two rounds it may have been a draw. Mosley has a lot of options though. Let's hope money doesn't decide all his opponents, granted he does deserve it at this point in his career and what boxing requires.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	The quick pick looks like Cotto, he has a fight coming up in a couple weeks, so they probably won't match up until mid-summer.  That is a long time off for Mosley.    I'd like to see him take on Clottey before a showdown rematch with Cotto.  Berto would be great too.  I know Williams people say he can come back down to 147 easy, but he's going to be fighting weighing about 168-170 pounds in his next fight, it isn't easy to cut that type of muscle and fight comfortably - if he could, that would also be a great fight.      You obviously have the winner of Pac v. Hatton, but that too could take 6 months or more to materialize.  I think Mosley is a true fan's fighter, and he realizes that there are so many great fights to be made out there, that he won't wait around for the mega fights against Cotto or Pac/Hatton, he'll take at least 1 fight first - he may have looked 27 against Margarito, but the truth is he is on a timetable here, and hopefully will fight as often as possible against in the deepest division in the sport.|`|hIOkdSEFaa	i say up and comer andre berto|`|AA10744471	The Pacman would be an ideal opponent, presumably to avenge the devastating loss of his friend-business partner de la Hoya.|`|xlyk63xRaa	paul williams should step back down and challenge him.

E5mFWOqqaa	Well, first you have to meet the requirements:    1. A LOT of money to spend racing and going through the ranks.    2. The drive to actually keep up with it- you WILL have a hard time almost non-stop. It'll take years for you to rise through the ranks and even get a NASCAR division.    3. Once you get there, you gotta have sponsors. You can't survive in the racing world unless you've got REALLY deep pockets, sponsors, and the ability.

But he was just a mediocre outfielder.  Keep in mind the Ted lost several years out of his prime due to WWII and Korea as  a Marine Corps fighter pilot. If he had played through those missing years when he was at his peak as baseball player there might not have been any hitting records left for anyone else.    His book on hitting is still the standard for those who want to be hitters and not just batters, big difference. Ted hurt himself as he never bowed to sports writers or fans. I suspect he was very shy and kept people away in that manner.    Add: Pete Rose had only average skills, he made it up through hustle. Too bad others have not followed that pattern. But Pete was short on smarts, he messed up on his own.    Depends on how you rate pitchers. If you are for a star as in the sky, burning bright steadily that is one thing. But if you want meteorite that blazes across the sky it is another.     Koufax was the meteor. I saw him play in 59 when he was a bonus baby. I sat just off the field in left field of the Coliseum when  he warmed up for a game that was lost. The speed of the ball and the impact sound in the bullpen catchers mitt was intimidating.  Add: I believe the Koufax never, ever, hit a batter. Keep in mind he was part of the team of Drysdale and Koufax. Don did hit a few.  :-)|`|fHxpycJSaa	Hitter - It's a tie between Ty Cobb and Ted Williams  Pitcher - Tough one, but I'm going with Cy Young  Player - Babe Ruth|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Babe Ruth  Sandy Koufax  Babe Ruth    Have a nice day.|`|EtEf098yaa	Hitter: I'm going with a new answer, just based on ability to hit, Tony Gywnn.  Never had a bad year, always got the job done.  Always made contact, did what he had to.  He never was a power hitter and never got the same attention, but he was a first ballot HOF and rightfully so.  Ted isn't a bad choice either.  Arod is not the best hitter by any means of hte word, he's the 3rd best HR hitter ever, maybe (behind Ruth and McGwire).    Pitcher - This is definitely up for debate.  From what i've been told Sandy Koufax should be up there.  I can only go by what i've seen (born in 1980) and i'm going to say Greg Maddaux.  Never seen anyone do what he did, and he did it like no one else (he was a pitcher who got batters out, not a strikeout pitcher) .  It even harder, and no one did it as long as him (though Pedro in his prime was about as good as anyone in their prime).    Player - I'll agree with Babe Ruth there.  P, hitter, but couldn't play the field all that well.  If defense counts, he's out, and put in Willie Mayes, with Mickey Mantle as a close 2nd (barring injury he would have been better then Mayes).  Then again you can say the same about Ken Griffey Jr.  But I'll say Willie.|`|AYiVipawaa	Hank Aaron/ Ted Williams: Hank Aaron has the most hr. Williams has good batting average and hr.

WgTKHqlnaa	Because for some reason they haven't figured out that the real problem is Brian Murray, not any of the coaches.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Simply put, there has to be a fall guy. The GM will never admit that he has drafted poorly for the last five years. All Hartsburg had to work with was one scoring line and a group of nondescript forwards that do not have the talent to compete at this level. The Sens are atrocious defensively and they do not have a number-one goaltender on their roster. When a team has given up on their season, all too evident if you have watched the Sens play the last two months, management has no choice but to fire the coach. They do this to appease the disgruntled fans and silence the over-zealous Ottawa media. Is it the answer: no. It is a stop-gap measure designed to give them time. Now, there is no pressure on the interim coach and management will focus on naming a full-time coach this off-season. This, of course, will cure all that ails the team.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Everything that is wrong with the Sens can be summed up in two words: Bryan Murray. He has never won anything (and never will). Craig Hartsburg is an excellent coach and he had to pay the price for all the garbage that Murray has brought into the Sens the last few years.

In other words if the Cards won you wouldn't be screaming. So have your fun and claim it was the refs, just remember the record books will always say the Steelers won.    As to Holmes he just got the likely game winning TD, wouldn't you protect that ball with your life? That wasn't showboating. You forget the review? We ALL knew it was going to be reviewed, or it should be. It was too close not to double check. If you want to complain about the celebration and using the ball as a prop I can accept that, but your complaint is just silly to me.    Another thing as I read this whole rant. If the knee doesn't touch the turf it isn't down. I understand not studying a rule book but that has been the rule forever. Not to be rude but do you just watch the Super Bowl? The ball DIDN'T touch the turf, and if you show me where it did I'll admit it.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	1. Steelers completely outplayed the Cards for 50 minutes out of 60    2. Refs made bad calls for both teams, and Arizona actually got points directly from a terrible call (the phantom Hold that resulted in a safety)    3. Harrison made it into the endzone without a doubt, the first part of his body to touch the ground was his helmet and by then the ball was a half yard past the goal line    4. Warner fumbled on the last play, it was clear as day had you bothered to look at the replays.  Should they have looked at it?  Yeah, but no way in hell it gets reversed so the point is moot    Look the Cards played a good game and did better than most people expected them to, so be proud of your team and quit crying about something you realistically got the better of.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	I wanted the Cardinals and they should have won except for those bogus calls!|`|0dlYbctDaa	I had no preference in who won this game but I will have to say that the roughing the passer and roughing the kick holder calls were both terrible calls that should not have been made. The int. return was a good call and he should not have been called down on the one. Also the player for the Steelers who threw the punches should have been ejected based on NFL rules that state any player who throw a punch will be ejected from the game and fined by the league for his behavior.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	The Cards deserved to play in and win the Super Bowl....the same 9-7 Cards that won 6 of their games in their pathetic division????....as oppose to the same 12-4 Steelers that had the toughest schedule in the league?????  Your question is so blindly biased that it isn't even worthy of any thought out responses.....|`|f3ee8f568e1351a50c7d84f228bcc643aa	This wasnt a "refbowl" the cardinals was fouling all over the place and obvious fouls at that. They beat themselves with 91 yards of fouling and all of them obvious. The cardinals are less experienced like you said to the superbowl environment, and it showed.    Curt Warner didnt get his momentum going until 4th quarter and at the end when the steelers fumbled the ball, he tried to do a Big Ben scramble much to his displease. Kurt never try a Big Ben scramble...only Big Ben can do that :).    And about the Harrison touchdown they werent even allowed to "officially" challenge the play but they did anyway. Once the 2nd quarter is over you arent allowed to challenge a play but they did anyway giving the Cardinals a even more chance.    All in all the cardinals beat THEMSELVES.|`|F5Jms9OBaa	1.I think the Cardinals shouldv'e won  2.The Cardinals because they diserved it and worked harder to get to that position especially Fitzgerald!    I agree with you 100% buddy it was a ref bowl   We got like 25 penalties of 140 yards and they only got 4 for 30 yards!  IT WAS DEF. A REF BOWL

3teWTOPqaa	Did you see the Portland vs Hornets game? I bet CP3 was wishing he can score like Kobe to stop his team from choking a double digit 4th quarter lead.    Anyways, if Kobe can take 31 shots and get 60pts, then he has every right to take those shots.|`|uxregJ0faa	Only your kind will discredit him. He had a great performance|`|KhBmlaefaa	Anybody shooting the way he was, I'd welcome that any day. I don't like the guy but c'mon, he wasn't shooting 25% on 30 shots. He shot crazy lights out tonight to the tune of 60%.|`|oGBEl25jaa	hornets top scorer today was 25 points. he took 24 shots.    kobe dropped 61 and took 31 shots.    he was efficient.    had he missed a lot of shots i would agree.    but he shot over 50 percent and is the greatest thing this generation will witness in basketball.    as for paul.    hes not a shooter so how can he ballhog.    its haters like you that are a disgrace.    you will never play a second in the nba let alone drop 61 yet you get on this site and hate on the greatest player in this generation.    wow you are the one to talk.    appreciate greatness and shut the *** up|`|Zt1VDawZaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcgy6xLr...|`|98wFqBwSaa	That's just Kobme being Kobme.|`|xO2fDqklaa	I was kinda thinking that to.

I don't know his numbers exactly but it seems as if his scoring has been down this year compared to previous seasons.  Paul as MVP. I have no arguments with that.|`|eTUEAWO9aa	what are u talking about? pau gasol had like 30 and ariza had 13? kobe was in the zone and got them a win so thats all that matters. and that hes smelling victory tonite on his haters|`|tBuzrlSdaa	You are so dumb, we will lose if Kobe takes small shots. He is the best player on the team. Damn hater. SO Wilt made 101 points before means he is a ballhog? I dont think so|`|oZKs3cPxaa	if kobe is not the MVP, how did he lead his team to victory today. when he went out in the 2nd quarter, the knicks were catching up. when he came back in, kobe and the lakers were kicking ***. AND HOW THE HELL DOES KOBE SCORING 61 POINTS IN A GAME AND LEADING HIS TEAM TO VICTORY LEAD TO PROVING THAT CP3 IS MVP NOT KOBE????????????????? DONT HATE BECUASE YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER ISNT EVEN CLOSE BEING AS GOOD AS TO KOBE!|`|6klgIoQJaa	Because you touch yourself at night|`|OiljXd8Uaa	kobe haters always find some kind of excuse to bring Kobe down. I dont get them. Its like they have no intelligence whatsoever. If kobe doesnt shoot much, they say he can't outscore MJ.. i told you so kind of remark. When he scores then he's a ballhog... FInally, if Kobe is both passing and shooting well.. then they call him a rapist. WTF? Give that man some credit for maintaining the popularity of the sport throughout the world.|`|Og89azFcaa	usually i would be the first to say kobe is a hotdog...but i can't say anthing if he puts up 61 on 30 shots...dats ridiculous...u gotta appreciate greatness when u see it|`|AFK4sy15aa	yes he is a ballhog. what are you going to do about it|`|xhHfXuKFaa	if CP3 scored 61 would u still be saying that?|`|AA11488609	His role is to be a ballhog, and he is a good shooter, so that is why.

qEjpOsyKaa	I also like Tuukka Rask and believe he's an awesome goalie.     But, I would let him play in the AHL for longer because he'd just be riding the pine a lot of the time. Bruins have a good thing going with  Thomas and Fernandez so I don't see them doing it. But then again, I'm pretty sure Fernandez's contract is done at the end of this year so you never know.     I personally wouldn't because Fernandez is a good playoff goalie (insurance in case Thomas cracks) and the Bruins definitely have a shot this year. Why change something that's working for them?|`|Bv0I2aRAaa	Trading Fernandez would be ideal considering it would be selling at a high point...but there is no team to trade with...teams out of the playoffs don't need a rental (he will be a unrestricted free agent at the end of the year) and good teams won't want to trade a top 4 defense man...which is what Boston would want in return... I am from Boston and am a Die hard Bruins fan...Rask is the future and would thrive with Thomas as Fernandez has but a trade is very unlikely...|`|8crDZMU4aa	The sports shows talk about this often lately.I also think Rask is a very good goalie but I don't want to mess with success this year.  Fernandez has done a great job during the first half of the season.  No,Boston will lose a chance to deal a player instead of just letting him walks but we need seasoned players in the playoffs.One NHL game this year does not make him ready to help us win Lord Stanley and bring him back where he belongs!Tough decision time has arrived.  Go Bruins!!!!!!!!!!!|`|mbtx2gWeaa	Tuukka is a good goalie but he is young. i am a huge bruins fan and i think Manny Fernandez is an insanely good goalie.  to trade him would be a huge mistake. trust me Tuukka will get his shot but i think he should get more seasoned in the ahl.  Go MANNNNY

b8I7WDhXaa	I disagree. I think most of his fans will stay with him. Sure, what he did was downright stupid, but he is an Olympic athlete and has 8 gold medals. What are you doing with your life? I don't see YOU winning any gold medals.|`|habVAikEaa	listen, all athletes, whether they are pros or not, do lots of crazy things.    Vick created a dog fight match  pro. baseball players(are usually the ones on lots of steroids) use them.  plaxico shot himself in the leg.  and now, phelps is a pot head.  next, you probably hear about an olympian cuss out the officials in front of everyone.  who knows, **** HAPPENS.  he still is one of the greatest athletes.  so this sort of stuff happens, and everyone needs to deal with it.|`|zfQDHAkUaa	i would have laughed to me honest... haha  i used to be a HUGE  michael phelps fan...but im soo disappointed in him. he's the BEST olympian EVER. he just lost a million fans.|`|2khmhsHnaa	that pot maybe aint so bad....|`|fqrE36YSaa	I knew something was up. Nobody is THAT good.  I knew it wasn't the chlorine in the water.  Explains why he eats all of those big meals everyday now doesn't it?|`|DLxh9CANaa	If you need to ask this question, I think you must feel pretty bad yourself. Phelps is a kid who made a mistake, nothing more. He's apologized for it, and it's time to MOVE ON. He's not the only athlete in the world who's had problems- look at Michael Vick or OJ Simpson. Their offenses are far more serious than Phelps', but they have basically gotten away with it. People like you tend to forget that underneath all the glitz and glamour, there's a real HUMAN BEING- one who has flaws and shortcomings, just as we all do. Phelps isn't perfect, but then neither is anyone else. Did you know he has the learning disorder ADD? ADD affects a person's ability to use good judgement, and to control impulsive behavior. There are MILLIONS of people with this problem, some of which are famous- and there is evidence that it may be hereditary, at least to some degree. Phelps was most likely BORN with this tendency, and it's not his fault that he has it.     Give Phelps a break. He deserves it- he's young, inexperienced, and has a lot to learn about life, and about the pressures which go with being famous. Everyone does things they regret at that age- it's part of the way we mature and grow up as people.
Y4RS35M7aa	You really need to get or download a ballistic table.  I highly recommend the Hornady Reloading Manual, which includes, in Volume II a complete ballistic table for projectiles .17 cal and up, and also has all kinds of neat information concerning the history and development of different cartridges.  My edition is pretty old, but they update them all the time.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Equation??? ---- Forget the math? ---    There are tables already out there for the ammo you are using...    Just pull up the ammo you are using on this link below and all the math equations are already done and are ready for your use.....      http://www.shootingtimes.com/ballistics/|`|4mb6xaxBaa	32ft/second squared|`|svbFM4Zyaa	It is different for every bullet but the thing is that if you want to see how much one type drops just go to the ammunition website and you can see the ballistics chart for the round your shooting over each yardage.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	There are a lot of variables, and the equation is too complicated for working by hand anyways.  Here's a calculator.  Hope it helps.  http://www.biggameinfo.com/BalCalc.aspx|`|lsKEbeacaa	distance drop in feet  = ((time x time) x 32.2)) / 2      If you know the time period you can determine the distance a falling object has traveled in that span.     Firing perfectly horizontally and under idealized conditions i.e., in a vacuum, the bullet will drop 16.1 feet in the first second.     In two seconds the bullet has dropped 64.4 feet.    Three seconds: 144.9 feet.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	A ballistics chart from the manufacturer is the best way to get decent info.      The calculations involve the acceleration of gravity (of course),  as well as the mass, ballistic coefficient, and sectional density of the bullet to calculate drag.  The Big Game Info site has a pretty decent calculator.    However, just the formula, even if you work it, is a half-answer.  It assumes you start with a vertical acceleration of zero (ie a barrel parallel to the ground).  This is never the true case, since for the bullet's flight path to ever intersect with the point of aim, the bullet has to begin with an initial upwards velocity.  Therefore the distance to zero also has an effect.

Yv5RYcmvaa	I strongly discourage use of violence, but I understand that there are times for it.   The best tactic I can suggest is that you do the following:  When he comes at you, puck him hard in the chest or just a few inches lower (the gut) and if he bends enough, give him a fast elbow to the back.   Make sure your elbow comes down on him. Don;t continue from there, unless he is still coming at you.  Also, make sure that you control the movement of the 'skirmish'. That is key.  Again, do all the above if there is no other choice.|`|65PS8shGaa	jab. hard right/left depending on what hand you use. then take him down and either submit him or feed him elbows. check youtube for bjj mount submissions

ySvQf3e5aa	Yes, whoever wins this fight will get the title shot. Rampage will definitely win so he'll fight Rashad next for the belt, than they'll probably give next title defense to Machida. Or if Jardine wins, than they'll probably give the title shot to Machida, however they'd need another big name fight to anchor that card, because Rashad vs Machida = no PPV sales...|`|AA11517536	Jardine likes to throw leg kicks and Jackson doesn't do a great job checking those.  If he figures out how to check the kicks, I'd say he has a good chance against Jardine.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	I can c Keith jardine winning but it would be by deisicon, he has the stand up tools to win, he would have to circle and jab/leg kick for 3 rounds, basically what he did with Chuck only having to worry about the left hook, Jardine has Greg Jackson in his cornor,and along with good cardio, stand up, and chin i can c Jardine winning a hard fought fight|`|eSvi5IDPaa	Yepp winner of this fight or Machida will get title shot.    I think Keith Jardine will pull a upset.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	No way jardine will upset.Rampage looks better than ever and has really cleaned up his act.|`|65PS8shGaa	page is going to ko him|`|S0N3BRecaa	Jackson wins.

TG78hidsaa	Its all about your style bro. You can buy the top of the line stick but if your not comfortable with it its not going to do you a lick of good. I personally use a sher-wood rm19 with a Bouchard curve. I love it! Go to a local Hockey shop that has guys who know what their doing. Tell them your problem they should be able to help you out. As for flex ask them too. Flex test them and see what you think. Stronger flex is more a of a slap shot kind of stick. Where as a weaker flex gives you that whip kind of motion for harder wrist shots.    Hope this helps good luck!|`|UkW9FPEZaa	I have a CCM U+ Recchi curve its a nice stick and a way to tell what a stick is good for is how big the curve is. A bigger curve is better for shooting a smaller curve is good for passing and back hand shots.|`|axxQzOCHaa	This is too random a question without seeing you play, but generally I use Easton composite shafts with a mid-curve fibreglass blade (brand does not matter, but the Modano pattern works well for me on the forehand and backhand) Although at my  weight I probably should use an 85 flex but a 100 gives me more control / durability|`|auhz5a6caa	easton makes pretty good sticks (Se17 and S17 are very good sticks, have em both) iginla and the lindstrom curves are good and i can't remember the lies for them tho|`|HSsqa0Vgaa	Easton and CCM sticks are ok, I really like sherwoods too.  It is tough to find something that fits you with them being so expensive, so when your shooting around at pickup or warm ups ask people if you can take a couple shots with their stick. I love warrior lax gear, but their hockey sticks are awful, they are made by Technique i believe, who made horrible sticks too.  I am a big fan of the Easton Synergy Sakic|`|7QAFd6oqaa	I would  recomend the rbk 7k sick kick.  its light, durable, and cheap.  if you want a good wrist shot i would recomend the datsuyk curve.

iz5zDFxvaa	You must be one of those spoiled-rotten fans who only know about winning and live in your own little fantasy world. We just got finished signing 3 of the top free agents on the market and you're still not satisfied? WOW, talk about greedy! As a Yankee fan here, you give the Yankee fanbase a bad name. Shame on you!|`|WUuO6wbAaa	If the Mets were to make Manny Ramirez a last minute offer, I think this would be wise of Omar Minaya. You have to understand the economical rationale though. The Yankees have spent 423.5 million this off-season. Even though they're payroll is less than it was at the end of last season, they have to spend a lot on the three superstars they've already brought in for the next 8 years. The Yankees have 4 OF's right now, all of whom have decent sized salaries. I don't know how willing they are to use Swisher in CF, but the truth is, if they're not, they've got a logjam of highly paid OF's. Nady's a good player, but the fact he's in a contract year means his value won't be good. Still though, a team like the Mets who needs a right-handed bat and who've seen him do well for themselves may be interested. There's a way for the Yankees to make space for Manny, but at this point, they don't have the money. No one will trade for Matsui or Damon who are both paid 13 million each. Not unless they pay for at least 5 million of their salary.    Brian Cashman may not be the best GM, but he's not horrible. Honestly though, any GM who's got a payroll of that magnitude to use wouldn't seem like a bad one. He got the Yankees 3 superstars and you're ready to throw him overboard for not getting a 4th? Manny wants 3 or 4 years. Why give that to him if no one else is? If they could get him on a one year deal, they may consider it. But it'd require trading two OF's, probably Nady and Swisher, which can be done. I don't think he wants a one year deal though. He'll probably convince the Dodgers to give him back the 2nd year, likely at 45 million again.    I know Minaya would love to sign him, but the truth is, the Wilpon's were effected by the Madoff situation. They've never exceeded the luxury tax and resent the idea of doing so. Their payroll is at 133 million right now and the luxury tax is 160 million. If Garcia's on the 25 man roster for a day, that jumps to 134.5 million. He's got a bunch of other incentives, along with others, who can hike that number too. The only way Ramirez is ending up a Met is if they trade Delgado, which may not be the worst idea. They could move the Murphy/Tatis platoon over to 1B.    With or without Manny, the Yankees are not winning a World Series. They may get to the World Series, but if I were a betting man, and I actually am one (although not on this issue), I wouldn't say the Yankees are winning the AL East, the pennant or the WS. Maybe the Wild Card. I say the Rays win the division and Red Sox and Yankees go down for a tight race at the end. Now if Manny were to end up a Blue Jay, this would be some 4 way deadlock. But that doesn't seem like it'll happen.|`|eP0KkYR3aa	Yankees don't need manny as bad as the mets do but the mets are too cheap so hes not going there. Yankees have too many out fielders as it is. Mark Texeira  is a better pick up any ways i don't want manny|`|9lDqqQ8Iaa	Are you kidding me? How spoiled are you Yankee fans? You guys have the top four highest paid players of all time on your roster and you are whining about not getting Manny Ramirez. Oh, no. We might not be able to buy the World Series this year. Mark Texeira is a better pickup than Manny at this point in their careers anyway. The best bet would be to start building a legitimate farm system again. The Devil Rays proved that stockpiling young talent beats grabbing up aging and overpriced free agents, even in the American League East. The Orioles are in the process of a similar plan, and look for them to be contenders in the next 2 or 3 years that way. You can't always buy a good team.

X8NGHSP8aa	I think he's a little bit of both. He has made it clear to his team that they will do it his way. He stood his ground when Casey Hampton came into camp over weight and when Willie Parker complained about the way the running game was structured Tomlin made it clear that he not Wille was running the team. He sat Santonio Holmes out of the Giants game because of off the field issues, so I think that his track record on being a disciplinarian speaks for it self. Mike also has his players backs, he will defend them and take the heat when necessary but he expects a lot from his team. To his credit when Tomlin was hired he was a defensive coach whose teams played a 4-3 but his first priority was to retain Dick LeBeau and allow him to run the 3-4 defense.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	He is a coach who encourages his team to do what it takes to win.

a8745d93f495ed1006e4532daff1bc40aa	Wow you have a picture of Jake Plummer who guess what choked against Ben Roethlisberger in the AFC Championship game three years ago - how ironic is that.  Ben kicked his a** and showed Jake what a real QB does.      Amazing how ur jealousy shines through in your question - you just are so envious of him.  He is with a winning franchise; 2 SB rings now, and who knows how many more.    Get a life and quit bashing people that are so much obviously better than you - He's a champion and his skills and ability were shown yesterday.      Mediocre?  Get a dictionary you obviously don't know what you're talking about.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Well said speedo. Don't pay him no mind. He obviously doesn't know anything about football, and he is just trying to rile the Steeler Nation. Ben was 21 of 30 for 256 yards and a QB rating 93.2 and drove the Steelers from their own twelve (after the holding penalty) with a little more than two and a half minuets to go in the biggest game of the year to a winning TD. With Hines Ward obviously hurting, he only had Holmes to go to. He made big throws on third downs and bought time with his legs to find Holmes again and again and again. All of his throw were right on the money. So Steeler fans just ignore what Jake the Snake has to say, he is just trying to get under your skin. As a matter of fact this will be the last time I answer anything from him. I'd rather spend my time at YA to talk football with people who actually want to discuss football not those who come here to talk smack.|`|AA10939368	It must suck to be a hater, most quarterbacks are not capable of what he is able to do.

7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	I think so and so does baseballthinkfactory.org's ZIPS projections.     Saturday, January 31, 2009  2009 ZiPS Projections - Boston Red Sox  For my money, this is still the team to beat in baseball. While the Red Sox can't match Tampa's massive stable of young pitching, the team is probably the deepest in baseball overall.    Some of the depth will be harder to keep around long-term as the players aren't young and a lot of the pitchers, like Smoltz and Penny, are fliers on pitchers with injury concerns, but there aren't many things that could happen that could really kill Boston's chances in 2009. Even Ortiz "going Hafner" is something the team could survive. Not much else to say; this team is a known commodity and there really aren't a lot of open questions.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	If Smoltz and Penny can play anything like their old selves, the Sox definitely have fighting chance!|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Everyone has a chance in my book...well for now since the season hasn't started.|`|yghiYtwEaa	No and im not a yankee fan  Yankees will pull it out but Soxs or Rays will be wild card  No matter what there will be 2 teams in the AL east and sox might make it if they beat the rays and the other teams that are trying to make wild card. unless Yankees completely fail then it is all yours to get to the world series and maybe win it if the white sox don't beat you and same with cubs.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Hopefully not, but if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to bet my life on who would win it, then I'd pick the Sox. They've got the best team, on paper, and the fewest question marks. (e.g. The Yankees 'could' have a better team, but so many question marks on that team, that they could also end up in the basement behind the Blue Jays)

gqoIfbH0aa	1. There are two hoops, one on each end of the court.    2. A player with the ball must dribble at all times in order to keep moving, only 2 1/2 steps can be taken without dribbling and this is debatable of what a 1/2 step is.    3. 5 players on each team are on the court at all times unless there is extensive injuries upon the rosters.    4. The team that scores the most points at the end of the game wins.    5. In a game there are 4 quarters which consist of 12 minutes each and a halftime period where a break is held.    6. In scoring in basketball, there are 3 forms of points, a 2 point shot, a 3 point shot, and a free throw which count for 1 point each.    7. When the ball goes out of bounds I.E. leaves the court of play, the ball is turned over by the team who touched the ball last on the way out.    8. When inbounding a basketball you must take 5 seconds or less or it results in a turnover to the other team.    9. Extensive arguing, disruption of the game, etc. will lead to a Technical Foul, a player can recieve two of these in one game then will be thrown out for the rest of the game.    10. A flagarant foul takes place when a foul is commited and the player who fouled appears to have made no play to the ball and is just intending on hurting/stopping/injurying the opposing player.|`|jDi45m0uaa	Wow justice..    why you wasted time writing these?|`|21nhdIXKaa	michael jordan is the best player of all time  wilt chamberlain has the record for most points in 1 game: 100  Boston Celtics have 17 nba championship       theres three|`|T0avNFQFaa	1. 2009 MVP = Kobe Bryant vs Lebron James    2. 2009 NBA Champs = Boston Celtics or LA Lakers or Cleveland Cavaliers    3. 2009 Most Improved Player = Devin Harris vs Danny Granger    4.

They have offense,  they're good at offense.

This is certainly not going to stop me from liking them. In fact, I'm more involved than ever. I have been waiting for this for years! It's finally happened. I can't wait to see how this plays out.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I still like matt and i thought his heel promo on smackdown was pretty good. This might be the push matt needs to become a true main event superstar. Matt just did it because he was sick of taking care of jeff and the fact that no matter what he did people always liked jeff better. I think this is the start of a heated rivalry between the two and it seems like an interesting storyline to me.|`|o4ARntxraa	Tbh, Not Being A Fan Of Matt Doesn't Mean You Should Stop Being A Fan Of Jeff's.

QcEcylBvaa	I feel the same way as you, no faith in Mexico. Ticallionstallion, nice words or encouragement or whatever the term is, but we have to be realistic here. The favorite is US.

This game is gonna be played in freezing rain. It's gonna be ugly.|`|x6lPKIIjaa	Mexico is goin thru a rebuild period rite now, i think sven is doin gud by experimenting and seeing wat players work well nationally becuz even tho temo and morales and many others are great players, they will not be in conditions to play the world cup in 2010 becuz of their age, and bofo isnt doin anything with his team rite now, but i really hope mexico wins, our players have great potential, also hoping that sven can find a team that works, MEXICO CAMPEON DEL MUNDO 2010!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7Xridrxaaa	Well for once with all the injuries and suspensions i think we can all say that the USA is favorito to win this game haha but throughout history Mexico has elevated their game against big teams like Italy,Holland, and Brazil and lost meaningless friendlies. VIVA MEXICO! though|`|LAdeGGGFaa	all teams lose and win, but dont you remember recent copa america mexico played good and same in the world cup.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	No faith in your team.......    what happend last year when Mexico lost to the US and had a crappy Copa de oro? everyone thought that they were going to get destroyed by the powerfull Brazil in the first game of Copa America, I seriously dont think that no one really expected the 2-0 win over Brazil...or ever imagined that we would even bring back home a 3rd place (nothing great but it wasnt expected)    Even if mexico is playing crappy and we lost against sweeden or even los Pinches hondurenos i will still support my team and I do beleive we can beat them....    All big teams go through tough times, and the real fans are the ones who stick with them and never doubt them    just my opinion ;-)|`|wKnjGSU1aa	I'm optimistic, I have faith in my team, wether they are on their best or worst form. I'm right there. Like I said before, yo me la juego a que Mexico gana. I don't know about the score, but I do think Mexico is going to win. That's my way of viewing it, I support them wether they are up or down. Mexico is always known to compete better against big teams, going toe-to-toe with them, but for some reason, it seems like they don't give their all against small teams (not minimizing any of them or not using it as an excuse). I'm optimistic that Mexico is going to win.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	I don't care about that Mexico is still going to win. You have to have faith because Mexico always does better with big team than with small teams|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Yep but with chile that was without the real badazz peepz  Plus Sven keeps trying to make up his style.  He needs to work with the players in their true positions and then develop from then on.  Plus he has made fatal errors like not calling great players like Bofo, Blanco, Hobbit, ETC..|`|5QfNKwqyaa	el problema no es el sven o los jugadores      el problema es de la femexfut que lo unico que le importa de la seleccion es exprimirla y sacarle todo el dinero posible, y tambien porque no hay un buen sistema de selecciones    y de los directivos que no invierten en las fuerzas basicas prefieren contratar a un jugador extranjero por millones de dolares que invertirlos en la formacion de nuevos talentos
4kdlE54Paa	You gotta go with Frank Gore.  Larry Johnson is on the downward spiral of his short career.  He was over used the first two years as a starter when Priest Holmes went down.

AA11720887	None of them is an upgrade from Hunter. This is only his 3rd year in the majors and his BA is .293 over that time. This guy has major talent. Cameron is a multi-talented player but he just can't hit for average. A lifetime BA of .253 for a guy who can hit 20+ HR's and can steal 20+ bases is a shame. But it just isn't there. Adam Lind have extreme possibilities, but he is more of a gamble than Pence.  Span, Young, Guillen, and Byrnes just aren't as talented. Guillen is a close second to Pence but Hunter will pass up all of guillen's stats. Lowell is a great 3B. He plays with heart and is one of my favorite players in the game. But in fantasy, you have to put those feelings aside. It's just about numbers. Same with Encarnacion. They just don't put up the numbers that Hunter will. Keep him.

NNn84vTCaa	WWE doesn't hate Jeff Hardy, other wise they wouldn't put the title on him. Vince doesn't give a flying fck what his Wrestlers issues are, Jeff pulls in twice as many fans opposed to the douche bags people support, he is over, and makes WWE alot of money. And Vince loves the money, like i said, if WWE hated him, they would not put the title on him.     Yes he's on two wellness violations, he was the companies champion, one of the most over stars there are, and has worked his butt off the past year. He knows for sure not to screw up, and I honestly think you are more likely to see CM Punk done for the Wellness Policy than seeing Jeff Hardy done again.    Edit; I didn't think you were a hater. Here is some info: Jeff was meant to win money in the bank at Wrestlemania 24, cash it in, and become WWE champion that way. But, he got suspended, so they gave the shot to CM Punk instead. They delayed Jeffs push because of his suspension, to see if they could trust him again, which is why he became champ at Armageddon.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	If World Wrestling Entertainment hates Jeff Hardy, why do they pay him so much money? Why do they push his merchandise and make millions of dollars and he gets a percentage of that? If World Wrestling Entertainment hated Jeff Hardy, they would never have re-signed him after they released him. They would have left him out there in the Independents. You'll have to ask the WWE Booking Team why he won the WWE Championship when he did.|`|NPbSdQ1Paa	They dont they should of fired him much time ago he did drugs twice he should be realesed on the spot|`|pO0rfIv0aa	what.....people dont hate jeff hardy. people hate matt.    and jeff hardy is not doing drugs
iOICjcZcaa	I would meet Randy Orton, NO doubts about it. I would ask him about his WWE career, of course. I'd ask stuff like "What was the most memorable moment in your career?" I'd also ask what he plans to do after he retires and just stuff about his life.     If I couldn't meet him, I'd meet HBK.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well I would have to say Randy Orton to see what he is like outside the ring so I could see both sides of him and I would ask what was it like growing up the son of a pro athlete and what is like to be such a BIG main eventer at your age and what do you see for your self in the further|`|J2bLQcHNaa	I'd Like to meet Jeff Hardy|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Undertaker, and I would say "Why did you decide to Wrestle"?|`|41WXZPnCaa	Y2J    Chris Jericho    I'll Say     God Bless Ya Man Amazing Wrestler I Remenber Corazon De Leon His Matches IN Mexico And Japana|`|YkdNNRFzaa	i would like to meet micky james because she is hot also jeff hardy|`|0NNEJXJPaa	Cena,  Are u retarded?|`|3svykAV3aa	Matt Hardy just so I could say "What the hell is the matter with you?"|`|18LodFaiaa	I'd be on the other end of the phone screaming my butt off!!!      I'd say either Edge, Christian, or Matt Hardy (duh... lol)      I'd talk to them about how I think they are reallly good at thier job, and how I think its amazing how far you can get from nothing. I'd probably goof off a while, talk about random crap, and act all star dazed, too.|`|CzTXKJoNaa	Well, out of the people in WWE now I think Undertaker. He's been in the business a LONG time.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Randy Orton or Chris Jericho.    To RKO: I would ask him how he feels since he started wrestling for the WWE until now; in a few years his stardom has increased rapidly. And he is really big and a great wrestler. And I would just say how cool I think he is.    To Chris Jericho: I would ask him how he feels from training and wrestling back in Japan to where he is now. And I would ask for an autograph, photos, etc.     (:|`|WK6vrkdKaa	Id ask to meet Triple H or Kane and id say to them "what made them want to become wrestlers?"..|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Christian.

To Batista "[pant, pant, pant, " words are not available.|`|IjWdqBuRaa	I would have to say EVAN BOURNE (My Baby)  I would tell him how good of a wrestler he is and that I admire him. Also that i'm one of his biggest FAN evur!|`|F3VjJAdiaa	For current wrestlers, and I can only pick one...It's a toss up between Finlay, Regal, and the Big Show.

I stopped watching wrestling a while back.|`|2ynZARB4aa	OMG I would pick John Cena or Batista.  O my god my heart would pound out of my chest i probably would not be able to stand up i swear.    I would ask John out lol because last i heard he was single, i would be perfect for him :) lol  I would try and get stuck in. but i would probably be a stuttery mess so he would be like he yea right girl    Batista i would probably just drool and collapse o i would die.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Chris Jericho    "Now Listen You Liar And Hypocrite, You May Have Good Hair, But Its No Where As Good As Mine!"    Just A Random Thought|`|02XHxknUaa	randy orton or the hardyz|`|5864fJdSaa	i would love to talk to chris jericho because i read his book and i would want to talk about going into wrestling and how wrestling connects with God, cause people like sting, hbk, and jericho have been on that one church channel, i forgot what its called.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the rock  he can tell me some jokes then get back stage off raw and annoy vince and stephanie like he did during the wwf era|`|SsodRf4kaa	HBK all the way.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	Randy Orton    "You are a great heel. Thank you."|`|vaVkveEkaa	I'd pick Evan Bourne and ask him how I could do a Shooting Star Press and a jumping calf kick.     BEST IMPORT OF WWE is.....    Evan Bourne!    EB for Life!!!

AA12103453	Did you see replays of the exact actions? He used the ball as a prop to pretend he was shaking the powder on his hands. That alone gives it away as he wasn't just throwing it in the air. I'm a Steelers fan and could tell CLEARLY what he was doing after I saw the replay, did see it during the game. Don't listen to some "fans" who just deny, deny, deny.|`|g5RS83paaa	some people thought he should have been penalized, you're not supposed to use the ball as a prop|`|puQEeOUIaa	It was a fumble.....|`|zOw22PDyaa	c'mon how can you not tell. dont ask me why he mocks him|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	it's obvious what do you think that pour thing was, and yeah i'm from Cle. too and yeah and he also looked up just like Lebron after he throws it i know it|`|JMPB5OO0aa	uhh, he shook the football in his other hand like he was dumping out the powder and then threw it up in the air with the same hand motion.  If it wasn't a lebron tribute then it's one hell of a coincidence.|`|MaizmvvMaa	It was clearly him pouring something on his hands and then throwing it up in the air, maybe he was pouring salt on his hands and throwing it over his shoulder for good luck.....    it was obviously lebron's thing.|`|BH05gFobaa	haha, you said hommage|`|EVU0sFhBaa	it probably was labron cause he used the ball as a chalk dumper.....................................    its  kinda ovios|`|fxOqJcJaaa	im pretty sure it was a LeBron thing.|`|SvRhoavUaa	No doubt, it was a LeBron homage. He even acted like he was putting the chalk in his hands before he threw the ball up.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	I think it was an homage to the pizza guy... in the LeBron commercial    The guy should have gotten a 15 yard Unsportsmanlike Conduct penalty for that but of course this is just one of many blown calls in one of the worst officiating jobs in Super Bowl history.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	From the commercial where he's a football player.  He should of been flagged.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	It was obviously Lebron.        To some of you:  You have to be a real sore loser to call for a penalty on something like that!  No real sports fan wants a penalty called for celebration EVER.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	It wasn't, Cards fans are jealous.|`|l1pewZpaaa	Seriously? It was obviously a LeBron "hommage"
lNubFvPkaa	Hey ill try to help.  First, rush yards are sumthing that comes mainly from the runningback but can come from the QB or a receiver.If the QB hands it off to the RB,runs it himself instead of throwing it, or hands it off to a receiver,thats considered a rush and whatever he runs for, is the rush yardage.And a rushing touchdown is a touchdown that is scored by running it into the endzone rather than a catch, meaning it would be a reception TD.    Second a sack is when any player on defense gets to and tackles the QB before he can get the ball out of his hands and pass it but it must be behind the line of scrimmage or the spot where the ball is placed or the blue line like on tv and somtimes you can see it on the game.|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	You are right for the whole Sacks thing but Rushing means running yards. Like when you run the ball and say you get 10 yards. Then you get 3 yards. Then 15 yards. It all adds up to 28 Rushing Yards.|`|7a4kzKVeaa	"rushing yards" are not things that you do.  its the yards accumulated by handing off the ball to your running back.  same with rushing touchdowns: they are touchdowns scored by handing the ball off, or running it with your quarterback.     a sack is when you tackle the quarterback for a loss behind the original line of scrimmage.    hope i helped : )
xwEEfzY7aa	Townsend, Tn is considered the peaceful side of the Smokies. It has everything you're looking for and it's more affordable than neighboring Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge...........|`|ICGQ9EBcaa	Moonshine Creek campgrounds are nice located in Cosby Tn. Also about a 20 min drive from Gatlinburg.|`|mwT1Ik5Jaa	If you're going to camp you can't beat the Smoky Mountain National Park. It has several great campgrounds.
4V6V9uN8aa	On occasion, Spoilers for certain cards are put out at Pro Wrestling News for WWE & TNA shows before they air to the public.  There is almost no way possible to get hold of an actual script of a wrestling show, not even of a past show.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	if we knew wwe would suck even more than it does in the pg era|`|vTalY5Skaa	Between any wwe diva's BOOBS I know it's true it's d@mn true!|`|sqfjfR3iaa	World Wrestling Entertainment does not make scripts available for public viewing. Why would anyone need to see scripts prior to the actual broadcast of the show? If you wanted to see what will happen tonight, you should have gone to the Raw House Shows this weekend, Mike Knox qualified for the Raw Eliminiation Chamber Match by winning a Qualifying Match at a House Show this weekend.|`|omCOMXqOaa	you cant i mean why would they do that|`|Gr7My8FTaa	u cant|`|84ceqOC4aa	hmm.|`|AA11482019	You can't.
RK9bJPOmaa	nope. i saw it here too man.  I been trying to everyone, but they were like u r makin excuses, cuz cards lost.  Man that game was all cardinals. I SO THINK REF"S RIGGED THIS GAME!!!!|`|Jp2415Whaa	Dude, i'm all out for getting the Steelers for the bs that was pulled in the SB.  I hate the Steelers and i've been a cards fan for a long time.  But WHAT ENCROACHMENT? Please don't just add random controversies, stick with ones that are actually getting somewhere.|`|aO8iBKkZaa	yep, you're the only one who saw it because you're the only one looking for a valid reason that the cardinals lost besides the fact that they were outplayed (although just barely).  Bad calls happen on both sides.  Be a gracious loser, it's more becoming.
TuOp3hNPaa	ok first u dont need to say "american" cuz that jus shows ur not american an ur also in the football (american) section so u dont need to express the american part.  but then for football ur jus score a touch down. then kick a kick for an extra point. then kick the ball off to the other team an play defense an keep the other team from scoring a touchdown.  also when ur on offense an u only have 4 downs if u dont think that u can get a 1st down (which is makin it 10 yrs from the spot where u started the 4 downs) then on the 4th down u do somthing called punting. which is where u drop the ball flat an kick it while its in the air|`|ohOaoiwwaa	Plz go 2 a professional team coach,  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|GINmkQMfaa	im pretty sure its jut catching and throwing the ball
