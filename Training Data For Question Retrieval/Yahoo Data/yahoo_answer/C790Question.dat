20090307150541AA6ZTAd	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Does being a vegetarian have to do the way your mind works?	someone who is not a vegetarian might look at some cooked meat and get hungry and want to eat it, salivate more maybe? something like a natural human instinct?   i don't really eat much meat myself, so i don't really understand it, i identify more with vegetarians..   are people trained to look at meat and feel hungry? if we are very hungry and haven't eaten in a long time, does that mean it would look more appealing, rather than when we are full with other things? even to a vegetarian? or is it a permanent thing in your mind that meat isn't a food, but something else like paper that you wouldn't ever consider eating..      any other theories or studies you've heard of would be good to know, too. i'm pretty curious about this :)      thanks!

20090307152201AACfLpZ	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Good ideas for my birthday party, i'll be 17?	Im 17 in april and i want some good ideas for my birthday party. Usually when my friends come over we will have some snacks, sit and watch a good movie, then perhaps go and play badminton in the garden or go out to the local park etc. Then we usually come back for a while, go on the play station and then finally have pizza etc. I want my birthday party to be a bit more exciting this year, one of my friends found my last one boring and went home early, which was rude, and the others enjoyed it all fine but anyway. no suggestions of alcholhol etc as most of my friends dont drink that much at all and arent interested in it, and i wouldnt be allowed. I do like some games but not things that are really difficult or logic kinda stuff. And i want to invite some new people from my college this year so any ideas what might make it a memorable experience???. It needs to be enjoyable but not too far. And we would stay in my house, so not ideas about going bowling or something or a meal, as i dont want to do that.      >>??      Thanks

20090307154358AALVeLW	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Question for vegans [20 characters]?	I've had pet chickens for a long time. They eat organic food and spend their days walking around our huge yard picking bugs and grass like happy chickens. We treat them good and give them treats like corn husks to pick and watermelon rinds to pick. They live in a spacious coop that's always clean. They even let us pick them up. We don't have a rooster, laying eggs is just part of what they do and they'd lay them whether we ate them or not.       My question is, why wouldn't you eat eggs from chickens like ours? We're not forcing them to lay, and they live a good life. We're not exploiting them, we have them just to enjoy having them. The eggs would just go bad if nobody ate them.

Fresh Strawberry Cake - Whole strawberries are chopped and folded into a white cake batter, usually topped with a rich cream cheese frosting      Orange Marmalade & Lemon Cake - A tangy lemon cake made with bitter English orange marmalade and lemon zest. A lemon and butter sauce is poured over the cake after it's baked, then iced with cream cheese frosting.       Raspberry Liqueur Cake - A white cake made with a French raspberry "crÃ¨me de Framboise" and raspberries folded into the batter prior to baking. A raspberry liqueur and butter sauce is poured over the cake when it is fresh from the oven, then covered with a rich cream cheese frosting      Texas Turtle - Devils food cake with caramel and nuts in the filling, white fudge frosting on the outside.      Carrot Cake - A moist traditional favorite with carrots, walnuts and spices, topped with cream cheese frosting.       BTW: I have tasted them ALL and they are soooooooo good. That makes it all the more difficult : /   Hubby 2 be picked the Top Layer and left me to decide the other two...please help me..

20090307133109AAjP70V	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Is storing chewed gum in a jar insanitary or harmful to students heath?	My teacher, Mrs. Patterson (8th Grade), Has this jar in her classroom that has about 4 inches of chewed gum stacked in the inside of it. When she sees students chewing gum, she tells them to put it in the gum jar instead of in the trash. She NEVER empties this jar and it has built up over the school year.      Every now and then she will open the jar when she wants a student to put gum in it. Does this put harmful bacteria in the the air? I would think that if ANY student was sick, chewing gum, and that student had to put it in the jar, then that could make the entire jar full of harmful viruses and bacteria, that go into the air when it's opened. Right?      I really want to prove that this having this jar is against   Hernando County School Board Policies.      Specifically:       http://www.hcsb.k12.fl.us/pdf/HCSB%20Pol...        http://www.hcsb.k12.fl.us/pdf/HCSB%20Pol...       And possibly?       http://www.hcsb.k12.fl.us/pdf/HCSB%20Pol...       Lastly, If I could prove that it is harmful to the students heath, I could probably speak to the principal and present the information I have collected, but I do not know where to start.      So what I really want to know is what I should do to get started.      Thanks,   Randy

20090307151352AAjD5ZG	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	First week of being vegetarian, and I've lost a lot of weight?	about 4 months ago, i was told i have hypothyroid. anyways, i blew up, and my cholesterol with 287. i didn't exersize or eat healthy or anything. i got in down to 211 in 2 weeks, and for the past 4 months i've been working off the extra weight i've gained. i've always been large, i was a 9 lb baby. but anyways, i decided to be become vegetarian for general purposes, not health. and i own a treadmill, and a stationary bike and weights, and i've been exercising 4x a week. and at first i had lost around 11 - 13 lbs and getting my metabolism back up in 3 and a half months. my appetite has completely suppressed in the past week, and i've lost 5 lbs in one week? i have been eating a lot less, and i am aware of my body and figure. but ive also been drinking a lot of fiji water, and eating grapefruits. i also plan on taking hydroxycut soon. but in the past week i haven't been that active, but the weight is just dropping off, and ive made lifestyle changes so i definitely don't want to gain it back, but this is healthy, right?      i also don't drink juice, sodas, coffee or eat fast food. i hate butter, whipped cream, cheesecake.      i eat brown whole weat bread, and drink fiji water, skimmed milk, and tea and a lot of fruits and vegetables. and i also take ADD medication along with thyroxine. i also have a bad habit of brushing my teeth when i'm hungry to avoid eating, or wash out the hunger by drinking water. i have a lot of little things i do, like if i have one big meal, later i'll have a small meal. lately i've been having a snack for breakfast and a big dinner. also vitamin C supplements.   and i havent smoked weed in a while to avoid munchies, same with drinking.
