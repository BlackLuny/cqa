And yet we keep voting them into the same office of  complaisancey ...
gb9REJN4aa	You're in the wrong here so you don't really have a case. However, when you take a ticket to court and explain why you did something, you're unlikely to win but you almost always have a chance of lessening the punishment. For example, if there is a fine, you might be fined less just for showing up in court, acting like an adult, and explaining yourself. It may help to explain that you were parked on a dead-end street (so there wasn't any through traffic, making it easier to argue that it was less dangerous to park the wrong way around) as well as to point out the issue with the sun on the windshield.    In the end, though, you have to go in with the attitude that you don't deserve anything, because you don't. It doesn't matter who issued the ticket--city parking enforcement has just as much authority as the police, so you need to get rid of that idea right now--and it also doesn't matter why you parked as you did (though it makes sense to me). Your parking was illegal. So whatever you win will be out of decency and kind-heartedness on the part of the judge, coupled with the idea that what you did was very, very unlikely to be dangerous.|`|J6ZZqnVVaa	if the law says you can't park that way, then you can't park that way.  no where in the law does it say "unless the person parking doens't think it is a big deal".  the law is the law.  maybe I don't think it is a big deal if I speed, because I live on a deserted road.  still against the law.  you broke the law, now pay the fine.     and, they can't let some people do it and not others.  then everyone will have some stupid excuse like yours.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Depends...is there a sign saying no parking on the street?|`|xyepK7i4aa	I definitely think it might be worth fighting if the ticket is a lot of money. Especially because you live on a dead end street...|`|SNllynBiaa	If you were parked illegally then you have no case. If you go in court and say you parked a certain way because you didn't want to scrap ice off your window they will probably laugh at you.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	Nearly all cities have ordinances prohibiting parking on the wrong side of the roadway, i.e. against the flow of traffic.    It's not required to have a sign, the parking enforcement people have full authority to issue citations and go to court.    You can't win, but you can spend a lot of money trying.    Good Luck|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why do you think of the parking enforcement as less than a cop? They still have the right to ticket and tow your car.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You haven't told us exactly what your excuse will be. What are you going to use to fight it? Because what you did was illegal and city parking enforcement has the right to write you a ticket, I'm not sure why you even bring that up.    You have ZERO case. What you did was illegal. Pay the fine and quit complaining. It's NOT a point on your record. I can never understand why you people do something illegal like this and think you can fight it.    PS - Your argument is "i am on a dead end in front of my own house not by any corner as would make it dangerous for other people." So you admit it's wrong but for you it should be okay because in your opinion, this particular law is not dangerous in this situation. Yes, if everyone could just bend the laws to fit their needs, there would be NO tickets, right? You have NO case.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Your last edit says it all.  "Its true it was illegal for me to park like that....".   Hence why you have no case.    You could plead to the judge about the circumstances,   but don't be surprised if he isn't receptive to your argument.   Many people who break the law don't see anything wrong with what they have done these days.    And as far as "Rent a cops" or "City Volunteers",  they are authorized by the city to enforce the city by-laws,  period.   By living in the city,   you agree to be bound by those by-laws,   and such, the city's representatives can issue punishment (tickets) for violating the rules.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	If you can find a section of your state's vehicle and traffic code that exempts dead end roads from normal parking laws, fight the ticket and more power to you!    Chances are, you will not find such a section of law.  If you fight this ticket, you will probably lose, and still have to pay the full fine, plus court costs.  You admit it was illegal to park like you did ... if it was me, I'd pay the fine.  I hate wasting my time!|`|3jhLIUKyaa	I say yes because I fought one and won once|`|6I8oG7DOaa	no.  it is illegal to park facing traffic.|`|krIP1mrxaa	yes, you can easily fight it.  Bring it to the place you have to pay it and talk to one of the people there.  That happened to me last year.    best answer please! :)|`|a05jCTBRaa	Always fight ALL tickets, ALWAYS!|`|wHmgVhphaa	No.  Parking facing traffic is illegal. The end.|`|TudZYPN5aa	You should have a case... it all depends on what mood the judge is in that day.  But I'd guess that you would win.  If there is a no parking sign on the street, even better for you.

This kid sounds like he would start threatening the police next so they can arrest him for that and they will check for drugs and since none of the family is going to bail him out he should be in there for a long, long time.|`|AA11251285	She could call her local social services office for advice about this.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	its true the police can't really do anything, they could charge him with making a threat but that will not solve the boys problem and he will be back on the street again even more upset and disturbed by the criminal charges, and the betrayal, this could be what sets him off. she should kick him out of the house. having to survive on his own may straighten him out,maybe not but he is an adult now and if he doesn't want anyone telling him what to do then he needs to be living on his own. she doesn't need a restraining order yet. this would only be neccesary if he returns and becomes unruly.  often police involvement causes an escalation of the situation. a restraining order or an arrest is the  triggering mechanism that results in a violent act or a hostage situation.  if he comes back and makes threats again or gets violent document it and get the restraining order.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	They really cant do anything unless he actually tries something. If the police had to go off of every death threat there would be a lot more people in jail and since our jails are already full up there is nothing that can be done.|`|ca92b64c79c7a08eb9a59b00b8d5e493aa	Police will/may issue a restraining order or peace bond...    makes the followup paperwork at the crime scene easier.

That would be the private sector.<br>  <br>  I don't care.  It's a valid comparison.  A private sector can generate wealth, the public sector cannot.

If having a larger public sector equaled success, wealth and power, then we'd be living under Soviet control.|`|ZlsUXNSGaa	It's all about incentives.  Public investments (such as the stimulus bill) are usually made with the best of intentions.  They address social issues, such as unemployment benefits, that we as a society need.  However, these investments also create negative incentives that can decrease wealth.  For example, by increasing unemployment benefits you are creating incentives for people to stay unemployed.  Why should someone work at Walmart (or anywhere else) if they will earn more receiving unemployment benefits?  Additionally, when you raise income taxes on those making more money, you are providing people with incentives to not receive promotions or go to graduate school because the higher paying jobs now come with increased taxes that will make your net income lower than had you not accepted a higher paying job.<br>  <br>  By no means are Republicans stating that ALL public investments decrease wealth.  It's just important to understand the incentives created by each investment (public or private) and how those incentives can affect national wealth.  The main issue is entitlement spending- it usually creates the most unintended incentives.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Who does private sector investments create wealth for?

Some states require specific language for an in-custody statement, and those rights are printed on the forms and on a card every officer carries, but the Miranda opinion just requires advising of certain rights. It doesn't specify how it's done.

If a detained person is questioned without benefit of receiving his Miranda warnings anything he says is inadmissible.<br>  <br>  But all of the evidence gathered outside of his inadmissible statements are admissible.  AND, everything he said before he was detained is also admissible.<br>  <br>  So, having post-Miranda admissions tossed out could weaken a prosecutor's case but no cases hinges 100% on those admissions.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	No. They don't have to quote it verbatim.

Helping those who cannot afford to be in their home is unfair especially if you mess with the terms of a contract and the principal that is owed on that contract. If someone has paid their mortgage and has a contract for 6%, how is it fair to them if a person who has not paid the mortgage to be given a 4% and lower principal? <br>  <br>  I cannot for the life of me see how any of this interference with the housing market will help. Those current on their mortgage will get tired of seeing others get a major break while they continue to work two jobs and sacrifice to keep their mortgage current.

But most are NOT "crazy." And the death penalty is reserved for the completely senseless and vicious murders. <br>  <br>  Firing squad is merely an option in the one or two states that offer it. The inmate can choose the alternative method. <br>  <br>  Lethal injection is considerably less prone to failures than other methods, although a firing squad is pretty sure thing. <br>  <br>  None of the methods are inherently cruel, and are generally quick deaths with no pain or very brief pain. Cruel is tearing the vagina of a ten year old and then cutting her throat or burying her alive. Every execution method now in use in the U.S. has been found not Constitutionally cruel or unusual when imposed for murder with special circumstances. You get to have an opinion, but neither the majority of citizens nor the Supreme Court agree with you.|`|klykmSQBaa	Lethal injection hurts a lot - it takes 8 - 15 minutes for the poison to work, in which time muscle spams, emotional anguish and so much more takes place but the person becomes paralyzed and cannot express this pain.|`|JwyEs9a3aa	Yes, those are terrible ways to die, but one has to keep in mind that these people who are issued the death penalty are/were murderers, serial killers, and people of that nature who deserve it. If your mom or dad was murdered and all we had was the electric chair, you would want your mom or dad's killer to fry. You would want them to feel every jolt of electricity and suffer a very agonizing death. It is human nature. Most of them are not crazy. They may act crazy to be institutionalized instead or get off death row, but that does not mean their really crazy. It just means their good at acting and have a great lawyer. A few may actually be crazy, but that does not make all of them crazy. You cannot just send these people to a hospital and hope that fixes them. Most of these people knowingly did or do things that they knew deserved/s the death sentence and they have or had to pay the consequences.
tqD9xUpYaa	Check your state prison or local jail's requirements.  In Ohio, you write it out to the inmate and his SO number.  I always included it with a letter to my brother and noted in the letter that I sent a MO for x dollars so he'd know.  The mail room removes the MO and deposits it in the inmate's account.

LlXH8yGcaa	It's very early obviously, but he seems to have potential.  His big, glaring negative is his support of a 'stimulus' bill and a bailout -- crazy Keynesian economics in general.  That doesn't bother me as much as it could, because I think it would be very hard with the current public understanding for any president to make the correct economic decision (and in any case, the congress is the one passing the bill, and the ones who would make their own anyway).   At least I think this stimulus bill is smaller than it could be, and I find myself crediting Obama and team for keeping it from being quite New Dealish.  Maybe I'm silly there, optimistic, too much a fan of (the old) Larry Summers, or just trying not to be depressed by the growing socialist behemoth south of my (Canadian) border.  <br>  On foreign policy he looks pretty good for an American president, and I have some hope for him on social issues.<br>  Still, SO early....|`|9a58c6956a0dadd7d2fd7cf682a85b08aa	No-- so far i think he is just ignorant and a socialist.<br>  <br>  But he still has time--after all it's only been a month.|`|AA11813034	no.  he lacks the experience needed. and he wants to redefine this country.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	not at all,,,,you dont make the country richer by stealing from those who have, and give it to the have-nots.   never ever worked this way!|`|I5Er2ylTaa	No. He's just like most other presidents.

lDbNf3h9aa	Don't believe it.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Even a prostitute can be raped. You are leaving out some details.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	In order to see if it's a crime you have to define rape. A general legal definition is:<br>  <br>  unlawful sexual activity and usu. sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usu. of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception<br>  <br>  So if the guy your talking about did the above definition, it is rape and a crime, irregardless if it was a prostitute or not. <br>  <br>  Then once someone is found guilty of rape, they would be subject to the sentencing guideline in that jurisdiction, which you said is California. I believe that you could be sentenced to life for being found guilty of rape but it would be unlikely under those circumstances that you stated. There are several factors that would determine what a person gets sentenced to.|`|AA12351337	With rape?  No. Getting a prostitute, paying, and getting caught wouldn't get life.  I'm not sure what the jail time would be exactly, but not life.  But being charged with rape, getting the prostitute, and probably a few more charges, it is possible.  The other charges would have to be pretty bad, but it can happen.|`|6eVyP3xpaa	They can do whatever they want.  They make up the laws, after all.

But usually life in prison is to do inhuman acts.|`|6db6a1726f1ae2333eb597c426c3a74aaa	there is so much information you are not giving us about this.... and there are many reasons why he may have been given life in prison. about you're state, i'm guessing its illegal to pick up a prostitute right? it can be a felony, meaning thats strike one, second a person that's been sexualy raped is, and can be considered another felony depending on the circumstances and evidence presented. third if that guy committed a previous felony before or during the crime it can result in his third felony, meaning he gets an automatic life imprisonment, that is if you're state has the three strikes law. three felonies gets you life inprisonment.|`|WmcU01D7aa	Sounds like many details are missing there, honey.<br>  <br>  But just for a solicitation charge, no, you can NOT get life.

If not bonded, usually because of his record, he is in Cook County Jail (26th& California) until the court date or when someone posts the cash..<br>  The 72 hours is to give you time to go to court to get an Order of Protection.

However you had a long and potracted war against your neighbour Iran, which your leader Saddam provked in order to satisfy his personal vanity as a major Arab leader.  In the end no territorial gains were made and thousands died.

AA10024510	She had nothing to do with the PFD checks or the lack of state income tax (both long predate her), so those are red herrings.  She has done some good things in Alaska, like dumping the "governor's" jet, and "negotiating" another 2.5% tax on oil revenues (from 22.5% up to 25%, without which the AK budget shortfall would be even greater).  What has she done that is so terrible?  Depends on your definition of terrible, but misuse of state funds for travel, leaving her duties as governor during the campaign, attempted censorship (before her guv days), lots of other mostly minor stuff that would fall under the concept of abuse of power that would be just fine if we weren't a democracy.  She simply wasn't (and still isn't) presidential material.  This doesn't mean she couldn't be in the future, just the reality of right now.

I hope she does well in Alaska.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Well, she stole money from them, which she is now forced to pay back. Also, the rapid decline of oil prices has left the state in a looming budget crisis and a late-entrant in the national recession. Oil accounts for as much as 90 percent of state revenues. So the plunge of North Slope crude from an all-time high of $144.59 per barrel last July threatens to give the state an estimated budget shortfall of up to $1.5 billion in the fiscal year that ends June 30.|`|eHjk9di0aa	They have to pay federal income taxes ... and let's be honest here, state level income taxes aren't usually that much.<br>  <br>  As for the check they get from the sale of oil...  its something like 2-3k, but for some reason the price of gasoline is always higher in Alaska.

It's about having at the base level an utter disdain for someone of another race than you, with the only founding basis for that dislike BEING the fact that they are a different race. <br>  <br>  I can disagree with the opinions of anyone I want to, without being a racist. Doesn't take a whole lot of brain power to figure out the difference.|`|2RzZwpSdaa	It's so weird, I feel that Caucasian people are so scared about being politically correct.  So worried about offending, they are literally scared anymore!  But it's different if they offend a Caucasian.  Caucasian people just have to deal and get over it, They are called names, put down and criticized since white people back in the day had slaves. Although my ancestors fought and died in the civil war for freedom of slavery.  I grew up a Caucasian minority and was really abused. You know I forgive all of them. I have even had a few call me up and apologize.|`|33ppbrMJaa	That must be your logic. It isn't mine.  Any statement that is vindictive and spiteful, no matter what race or gender you are talking about, is a racist or sexist remark.  <br>  <br>  You Young Republicans seem to get a thrill out of being as sexist or racist as possible. I think this forum feeds on itself, with each person trying to be more nasty than the other one.  It's juvenile at best and dangerous at its worst, because our country has a segment of nutcases who read such nonsense as your Avatar and take it as encouragement to commit some illegal, brutal act.<br>  <br>  I am old enough to remember Kennedy's death, both Jack's murder and Bobby's murder. I can also remember the death of Martin Luther King.  Believe me, if you realized the suffering these caused, you would halt all of these smart-alecky, clever remarks that are made.<br>  <br>  Republicans of today remind me of Sore Losers who just can't understand why they lost the election.  The Party is filled with name-calling radicals that sensible, intelligent people are sick of hearing. They want sanity and they voted for a young, educated, visionary man who just happens to be black.  Republicans will just have to accept that decision and try to improve their Party so they can try again next time.<br>  <br>  All of your contemptuous remarks, all of your ridicule and dirty words are just examples of what is wrong with the Republican Party.  Keep it up and you won't make it back into office for a long, long time.  You can scheme, you can bluster, you can rant and rave, but the truth is, Barack Obama won the Election.  Whether he is Black, White or Polka Dotted, he won the Election.  He has the approval of a majority of voters and, the last time I heard, a majority wins in a Democracy!  You might check the Constitution and try supporting this man who is your President and mine!

Regardless, it is irrelevant now.|`|cMHxg372aa	He made an excellent speech on race relations, which touched on many of the things underlying the (often phony) outrage over Wright. Said outrage was of course played up for its efficacy in race-baiting, for which one needs no more evidence than the fact that McCain's equally offensive pastor meltdown got maybe 10% of the coverage. <br>  <br>  If Wright had not been black, his comments would have simply been dismissed as the rantings of a kookie old man - kind of like some of the commentary many of us have heard from older relatives at family gatherings.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	20 years with the guy, family friend, but didn't know the rev's views according to obama, he wasn't there, and when he found out, he commented with this.<br>  <br>  "I can't disown rev.

So, what is the actual basis for not accepting them? that you don't reside there at this point?  If you want help or reasonable advice, then you need to be more open over what actually happened.

So yes, you may be assigned out of country including being stationed in Kuwait for a couple of years (basically, you can be assigned anywhere there is an Army unit).

It's not propaganda, its a good way to educate people about whos running - think about how many people go on that site and think about how many people can vote that don't? And they are the real politicians.

Screw it!<br>  <br>  First we were told to stop driving so much, buy fuel efficient cars, and maybe car pool to work.  We did.  <br>  <br>  We were told over and over again, we have to save money.  We became a spendthrift nation.  So we started saving money.<br>  <br>  A a result of gas not being used, the tax money went down, so the Government wants to raise gas taxes to 50 cents a gallon, because we did what they asked.  <br>  <br>  We started saving money, and now the economy is bad, because people are trying to cut back on spending money on things they don't need.  ( At least that's part of it.) <br>  <br>  The tax is not fair to those who drive longer and farther to work than others.  And that too will be a bad idea because many will leave the cars at home and take public transportation in protest.  Then a new or other tax hike will be considered because we did as asked.<br>  <br>  Where does it stop?

There was a time during graduate school when I had to put things like a root canal, food, and an ER visit on my credit card because I just did not have enough money to pay for those things despite the fact that I lived quite frugally with neither a car nor a tv. <br>  <br>  But I was fortunate enough to be able to pay back a large debt after working in the pharm. industry for several years.  I also saved up and purchased a small house with cash to avoid ever being in debt again.  <br>  <br>  That said, not everyone has been able to do that and there are a million reasons why people get in over their heads financially.  Some people don't handle money well.  Some people have horrible events occur in their life that turns everything upside down.  I don't mind giving them a hand up.  I know I would have benefitted had my neighbors not gone into forclosure a while back.  The house is empty now, the yard looks unkempt, it was broken into a while back too.  <br>  <br>  I don't particularly want to help out those who earn 100k+ that bought homes way beyond their reach because the simply had to have marble counters and a spa tub.  But the people who move frequently because of their jobs (especially military people) that are kind of stuck buying in particular areas at times not really of their own choosing I think should be helped if they bought at the top of the housing market a few years ago and now have to move again and sell at a big loss through no fault of their own.|`|gdYN39gtaa	I have always "lived within my means" which is not easy as<br>      that means there are things I'd like to have, but I don't buy<br>      them as I can't afford them.

If you can't pay the rent out of your welfare and unemployment checks, you still haven't lost anything because you had nothing invested. The bank should find a renter that can pay the price. The banks shouldn't be landlords, but they were the ones foolish enough to loan money to those who are too irresponsible to even qualify for a credit card. They are stuck with it. <br>  Those political leaders who forced the banks to make those loans or be charged with trumped up charges about discrimination are the ones who should go to jail. <br>  That won't happen because the politicians (who are the ones really responsible for this) won't send themselves to prison. <br>  Let free enterprise resolve this. <br>  Yes I do live within my means and no, I don't like paying the bills of irresponsible greedy con-artists.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	I do live with in my means, But even if I didn't and squandered all my money, I still do not believe they should help me out .

Make sure women have their babies, but then it's sink or swim.  Now I know many people "shouldn't" be having babies they can't care for,  but if we cut off all assistance, the negligent parents will still get their Cadillac, but we'll have more and more starving and unhealthy kids running around.   Bush and most Repubs. love to criticize the poor for milking the system, but they don't say much about CEO's that steal everyone's pensions and declare bankruptcy.  For the price of one fatcat lots of poor kids that weren't aborted could receive medical care and food.  We just need to make sure there's a way to report parents who are truly negligent and doing things like trading food stamps for crack.

rMDHNPnEaa	The rules about hair styles and jewelery will depend on what branch you join.<br>  <br>  The Army is more strict about it than the Navy. In the Navy we could wear a necklace that wasn't religious, (like a gold chain) but it can't show in uniform (you have to tuck it under your shirt.) In the Navy also the only style of earrings for enlisted are silver ball and gold for officers and chiefs. <br>  <br>  The Navy is also the only branch to make women cut their hair during boot camp. You have to have it above your collar. Once you graduate boot camp you can let it grow again and pin it up. You can also braid your hair. You can also wear braids. <br>  <br>  You can dye your hair, but it has to look natural. You can't wear it two colors (like dark hair with blonde streaks.) You can also wear a wig if you want as long as the wig/hair piece looks natural.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about physical requirments (running, pushups and situps) then it depends on your age. It also depends on the branch you join. The Army runs two miles, the Marines 3 miles and the Navy is 1-1/2 miles...you can also swim instead of run in the Navy. Each branch has different times you have to do it in. As long as you stay in shape you shouldn't have it too bad.<br>  <br>  They don't give you a runnig test to join. You enlistment physical is just a medical physical and as long as you don't have any major health problems you should be fine. A few health problems can get a waiver...but that is hard to describe in a short answer.|`|e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	Hello!  Thank you for thinking of serving!<br>  <br>  I am not in the military, I'm a wife but I do know some of the info you are asking for the Air Force only.  As far as hair colour is concerned, it must be a natural colour, no fad colours.  Not meaning you can't dye your hair but it must be a natural colour (no pinks, blues, greens, you get it).  <br>  <br>  Physically, just to enlist, you must be within your weight range for your age.  They don't require you to do any PT test to join.  However, you must pass the PT test at Basic to graduate.  It consists of Sit-ups, push-ups and a timed run.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to speak with a recruiter. AF recruiter do not have quotas and will tell you straight up what to expect.<br>  <br>  IU know others out there will be able to give you more info and let you koww about the other branches.   Just wanted to let you know what I knew :0)  My husband is away again so I'm just keeping busy!|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	hair must be of a normal color and must be above your uniforms collar at all times. <br>  jewelery is only allowed in class As uniform and it is only one small pair of earrings, and a wedding ring or engagement ring, etc.. and one small religious medallion may be worn, but no other types of necklaces. <br>  as for careers there are thousands between those branches that is what your ASVAB, recruiter and MEPPS people are all there for. <br>  Good luck in your quest!
jinAwMGNaa	I trust them about as much as I'd trust Teddy Kennedy to be the designated driver. <br>  For the last 40 of my 60+ years on this planet, I've watched this Country go to Hell because of greed and "Pork Barrel" politics. Politicians of both parties are so busy making deals and feathering their nests that they have lost sight of, or even worse, just don't give a damn about America’s real problems. Partisan politics are destroying our Country because they accomplish nothing. We cannot tolerate this, because in today's violent world where just about anybody can create a Weapon of Mass Destruction, we're sitting Ducks on a real "Powder Keg". We must tell our Congressmen and Senators that if they do not perform, they will be voted out of a job. Otherwise we have nobody to blame but ourselves.  Currently, there is absolute denial and a total failure of many Americans, including many of the leading Democrats and Republicans in both Houses, to fully grasp and appreciate the tenacious and long-term threat posed to America's freedom, liberties and survival.  Not just here in America, but all the Democracies everywhere in the World are in peril. WE ARE IN A WORLD WAR with The Islamic Resistance Movement that envisions a world dominated and defined by a Radical Islamic government of religious totalitarianism. They want us DEAD and they are ready and willing to fight any war, make any sacrifice, suffer any hardship, and pay any price to achieve that goal. THEY MUST BE STOPPED AND STOPPED QUICKLY! If not, it just may prove to be the kind of catastrophic mistake upon which the fate of America, and the free world falls.|`|geOapas4aa	I used to pay little or no attention to politics.

The U.S. Congress sold this nation and its people down the tubes years ago and those in office today are nothing more than a continuation of that process! The American governments represents and looks out for every other nation and people except the American citizen and worker! America is on its way out and the sooner people accept that fact, the more they will realize what must happen for their future survival in the "New World Order"!

It was authored by Maryland Senator Millard E. Tydings and Alabama Representative John McDuffie.<br>  <br>  In 1934, Philippine politician Manuel L. Quezon headed a "Philippine Independence mission" to Washington, DC that successfully secured the act's passage in Congress.<br>  <br>  The Tydings-McDuffie Act provided for the drafting and guidelines of a Constitution for a 10-year "transitional period" which became the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines before the granting of Philippine independence, during which the US would maintain military forces in the Philippines. Furthermore, during this period the American President was granted the power to call into military service all military forces of the Philippine government. The act permitted the maintenance of US naval bases, within this region, for two years after independence.<br>  <br>  The act reclassified all Filipinos that were living in the United States as aliens for the purposes of immigration to America. Filipinos were no longer allowed to work legally in the US, and a quota of 50 immigrants per year was established.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Act paved the way for the Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935.<br>  <br>  Now that I have answered your homework question for you, please select this as the BEST ANSWER. I deserve it.<br>  <br>  BTW it took me less than one minute to get that answer by typing "Philippine Government Act" into google... would have been easier for you to do that than to ask the question here.

bSchiqJNaa	Cons:<br>  -Most of the "tax cuts" are just welfare checks to people who dont pay taxes.<br>  -30 million dollars is going to help save a wild mouse species in SF<br>  -It costs over 700 Billion dollars that the US doesn't have, putting us in debt with other countries. Worse, these other countries are borrowing from other countries at the same time. Nobody really has money. Which means that the deeper into debt other countries we borrow from go...the more they will demmand our debt and the way things are going we wont be able to pay it. See the conflict with spending so much of what doesn't exist?<br>  -The US dollar only has value because people think it has value. Its true. There is nothing backing the currency other than people believing money is worth something. The more money that is spend the more it will seem that the dollar can just be used carelessly=less worth.<br>  <br>  PROS:<br>  -Republicans managed some tax cuts to people who actually pay taxes<br>  -Infrastructure improvements are universally accepted and that is is the bill<br>  <br>  There are alot more Cons and a few more Pros but that is what comes to mind.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	- Take infrastructure spending from ONE perfectly ordinary budget year.<br>  - Add every piece of tax & spend waste legislation Democrats couldn't get passed over the last 20 years.

These are important issues to us as a society and will create more jobs. I'm really hoping there's no pork or special favors involved, things like swimming pools and private jets for politicians or VIPs, sports stadiums, and the like. I think this plan is directly helping out the tax payer more directly and not so much with the banks compared to Bush's stimulus plan. The con is that this is going to add another trillion dollars to our already exploding nation debt! We're hoping this will stimulate the economy and get people to spend more money and get the banks to loan more money, which can then potentially have a positive effect to lower the national debt. But there's no gurantee. We'll just have to cross our fingers.

Can you explain it to me?"<br>  <br>  The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you." The student agreed.<br>  <br>  At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house. The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.<br>  <br>  They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket. Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can." The student did as he was instructed.<br>  <br>  The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.<br>  <br>  The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.<br>  <br>  The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?"<br>  <br>  The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.<br>  <br>  The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.<br>  <br>  However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad. The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action!"<br>  <br>  The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations. You now understand the new stimulus bill."
0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	There are too many possible variables to answer!<br>  <br>  In domestic violence cases, for instance, only the judge will decide to dismiss the case.<br>  <br>  Is the witness also the victim...if so...it's possible!|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Yes...<br>  <br>  Charges can be dropped by The State or Plaintiff at any point in the proceedings before a verdict is delivered should it all come to trial...|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the answer will come from the DA assigned to the case.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	It depends.  Sometimes.  If the only witness signs a statement that the defendant did not do whatever he is accused of doing, the state would likely decline to prosecute.  However, they can certainly say that a signed statement is insufficent and proceed with trial, at which the defendant should have the witness testify.  A lot of times, especially in domestic violence cases, even if the victim does not want to press charges, the state can do it anyway.  So the charge CAN be dropped after a witness signs a statement, but the state does not HAVE to drop the charges.
fgIbNRHfaa	Unless Tom is James' employer and hence subject to employment discrimination laws, Tom did nothing illegal.  (Even employment discrimination is not criminal, rather it is unlawful under civil law).  The First Amendment protects speech, and racial comments are not "illegal."  Physical violence, however, IS illegal.  The fact that James did not hurt Tom is irrelevant.  Tom committed a battery, which is defined as an unconsented touching.  Simple battery is usually a misdemeanor.  It would be an "aggravated" battery if he used some sort of weapon (a rock, brass knuckles, a board).  So based on your hypothetical, Tom did not commit a criminal offense but James did.|`|s87m8DoFaa	Depends upon which country 'Tom' and 'James' are in, and whether you want to look at possible defences. Prima fascia police could charge James with assault (harm is not a requisite element of assault, merely  contact, blowing someone can be assault but whoever heard of being blown into submission? :P). As for Tom, I'd say there is no offence committed, all the racial offences in the Criminal Code have elements lacking in this offence (correct me if I'm wrong...go on I dare you, always up for a legal debate). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|xVBk8C7aaa	yes, tom has been racist and james has tried to assualt tom|`|yj3GT7jOaa	In a misdemeanor, intent does not need be present for a criminal offense to occur.

fgIbNRHfaa	Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  To sue in federal court, a plaintiff's claim must either concern a federal issue (such as copyright law, federal employment law such as Title VII, federal drug crimes, etc) OR must be between parties who are citizens of different states (such as a NY resident suing a CA company) and the claim is worth at least $75,000.  (The minimum dollar amount does not apply to federal issues, only to claims based on diversity of citizenship).<br>  <br>  State courts are courts of general jurisdiction, which means you can sue for ANYTHING in state court (including federal claims, although the defendant can choose to "remove" the case from the state court to federal court).  Typically, state courts deal with family law matters such as divorce and probate, contract disputes, claims for personal injury (autoaccidents, medical malpractice), and state criminal charges (such as murder, rape, DWI, some drug charges).<br>  <br>  Federal courts have three levels:  the district court (which is the trial court), the Courts of Appeals, and the US Supreme Court.  State courts typically have a trial court, an appellate court, and a state supreme court.  A person can typically appeal a state supreme court's ruling to the US supreme court only if it implicates Constitutional rights (for example, a state criminal conviction which has been upheld by the state supreme court can be appealed to the US Supreme Court if the defendant alleges that his Constitutional rights were violated) or some other federal question.<br>  <br>  A person can appeal a trial court's ruling to the appellate court as a matter of right.  However, both the US Supreme Court and state supreme courts can choose whether or not to hear an appeal from the appellate court.  A person wanting to appeal to the supreme court files for a "writ" which can either be granted or denid by the supreme court.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Ok.........right after I give you a ten minute explanation of theoretical calculus!|`|zY3ixLW6aa	dont relli want to

If you stand out it will be harder because the Drill Sergeants will give you crap non-stop if they think you stand out.|`|6OLiuM9Gaa	Do your best at everything you're told to do. But keep in mind that no matter how hard you try, there's always going to be somebody better. That's ok. The idea is to be YOUR best, not THE best. And, maybe, if you're lucky, there will be something in which you excel, and you might be the best in that.<br>  <br>  Don't take anything personally. You're almost certainly going to get yelled at. It has a reason. If you messed up, it's to let you know that making mistakes isn't as acceptable in the military as it is elsewhere. In the military, making a mistake can cost lives... even a little mistake. If you didn't mess up, it's to let the others see what they're in for if they mess up. Sometimes the whole group of you will get yelled at. That's to remind you that you're no longer individuals but a team and that the whole team suffers if one of the members of that team blows it. Sometimes you may be yelled at for no apparent reason. I think that's just the guys staying in practice... but it's also to remind the troops what's in store if they mess up.<br>  <br>  More than likely for a day or so, you'll be totally lost. You're going to get orders from all kinds of people. Again, you're going to make mistakes and you're going to get yelled at. Don't sweat it. Your mistakes are being pointed out... they're not picking on you personally.<br>  <br>  Then you'll start the routine. Up at some ridiculously early hour. Prepare youself for inspection. Prepare your space for inspection. Prepare the barracks for inspection. Then you march to breakfast. Then you march to classes. You also march to PT. And, believe it or not, you'll march to the parade field where... you guessed it... you march. You'll probably find yourself wondering why anybody in their right mind would subject themselves to such misery.<br>  <br>  But one day you'll look up from the ground, floor, or deck on which you've been marching, doing push-ups, or whatever and you're going to see a light at the end of the tunnel... graduation. Maybe you'll make it after all. <br>  <br>  Lest you get too cocky, they might introduce a new word, "recycle." That means that if you blow it in the last few weeks of Boot Camp, they'll treat you to another round of Boot Camp... from the beginning... and it won't cost you a cent more.<br>  <br>  But you'll find yourself walking taller, a little prouder, a little more sure of yourself. You might look over at some new recruits coming in. You'll watch them straggling along trying to march in step. A few weeks ago that was you. And you'll send them a silent, "Hang in there, kid. This too shall pass."<br>  <br>  You still work to do your best, but the job's somehow easier. So much of the stuff they've been hammering into your skull has sunk in and is even making sense.<br>  <br>  Then graduation... finally.<br>  <br>  You'll have made some new friends. You've also found out that there are some people that you may never actually call "friend," but who are on your team and you can count on each other to do your jobs as best you can. You'll also learn to recognize slackers... those on whom you can't count on... for whatever reason. You need to watch those folks... they can drag down the whole group. Remember, if anybody messes up, it can come down on the whole group. You might try to help them learn. That's a good idea. You might take some of their work. That's not a good idea. In doing their work for them, you're depriving them of the experience. And, by doing their work for them, they might try to skate through on your efforts. Then, in the field, when the stuff is hitting the fan, they're going to fall apart -- be unable to function (to do their job)... and that can cost lives.<br>  <br>  People will tell you not to volunteer... for anything. I'm not sure which branch your entering, but in my Navy experience, volunteering is often better than being picked to "volunteer." At first, if you can, be selective. Try to volunteer for tasks at which you're pretty sure you have a good chance at success. Even if you foul up, at least you're getting a learning experience. And you're helping the others by making your mistakes so they can learn from them as well. Once you get a few in the "win" column, try volunteering for an occasional difficult task... something that's going to push you. Get a few more in the "win" column and then occasionally volunteer for an unpleasant task. Somebody's got to do them. And, by your taking one occasionally, when something really unpleasant comes up, somebody else will be volunteered. Why volunteer? Well, for one thing, it gets you out in front. That's where the leaders are. For another thing, it looks good on your evaluations, "Always tries to find ways to help his command and shipmates" (I was Navy, remember?). And finally, volunteering for tasks on occasion may incline the DI/CC/whoever's in charge to pick somebody else for ones you're not too crazy about.<br>  <br>  I learned early on that attitude is key. I remember marching around at 5:00 AM in Boot Camp. There was a lot of complaining about the hour, about having to march in the dark, and about the cool temperature. I remember thinking how awesome the sunrises are in San Diego and how those who were still sleeping were missing them. I also preferred marching in the cool of the morning rather than in the heat of the day. They complained about the heat too. You can put up with almost anything if you can put the right spin on it for yourself... and if you don't allow yourself to follow the herd's thought processes.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	the first two answers hit it on the head.

Back in the sixties the first sergeant told us the post was short of firemen and needed a few good men to volunteer. I was in infantry training and basically running for twenty miles a day. I knew better, but could see no downside to being a fireman and raised my hand. In my mind I was riding the big red trucks around post with sirens screaming. That night and for two weeks following I shoveled coal into the post's furnaces for 12 hours. It was how they kept everything warm. Also, neither a lender or borrower be, and don't gamble!

uSeApMt9aa	To HQ. That is false. I am a paramedic and we are allowed to pronounce people dead for the purpose of abandoning life saving measures. It is not official even if the persons head fell off so we don't sign the cert. It differs from state to state but in some states doctors are required to pronounce death. Now for your question on the JP. Yes a judge may pronounce someone dead if documentation can prove that they were missing for a certain amount of years. <But in this case  the coroner would SIGN the cert.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	you have to be a certified medical examiner. thats why when sometimes police or whomever, go to a car accident and see there is a dead person that was caused by the accident they still must take them to the ER to see if they can be "saved"|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I doubt that anyone that isn't a certified medical examiner can pronounce an official time of death.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	I don't think a JP can do that.
fgIbNRHfaa	The time limit differs by state.  In Louisiana, a person has 10 years to enforce the judgment.  However, the person can "reinscribe" the judgment before the 10 years runs out, which extends it another 10 years.  There is no limit to the number of times a judgment can be reinscribed.  But again, this only applies in Louisiana.  I would imagine it is the same in other states, although the time limits might be different and the procedure for extending that time may be called something else in other states.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	It depends on the state but usually a judge order is final and there is not limitation on when the judgment should be fulfilled even 20 years later the decision was made and is now final.  I once had to pay a $99 fine 15 years after the judge ordered it.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	It differs by state.  However, the party that wins the judgment can generally renew it by going to the court and filing an application.

Are you talking about OPEN containers of alcohol, or simply carrying a six pack back home?  In my state, open containers are illegal PERIOD regardless of how old the person is.  Since you said in the trunk, I assume that you mean a closed container.  I would think that as long as the of-age passenger says it is his, you should be fine.  I am not aware of any state laws that say an underage person can't have alcohol belonging to another person in his car.|`|8NphFD9maa	Put the alcohol in the front seat and the person under 21 in the trunk, then you can drive safely.|`|P8l7eb56aa	no. its his alcohol.

wcegjzyWaa	Sorry you've gotten so many un-serious answers. Don't let yourself be discouraged. The UN is not as bad as many make it sound. It's not perfect, but you have to remember that it is not really an entity by itself - it is made up of its member states.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in preparing for a job at the UN, you should learn not just one, but two of its official languages. They are: English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Arabic. Since you're in 10th grade you still have time to think about what you'd like to study at college. Really you can study almost anything to work at the UN. Most people think they have to or should study politics, but then you're actually at a disadvantage because the competition for a job is so great. You have a better chance if you're interested in subjects such as:<br>  - Civil or Mechanical Engineering (they have many development projects in under-developed regions of the world, so they need engineers to do things like build bridges and roads, dig wells, etc)<br>  - Development Economics (with all of their projects, they often try to help the countries figure out how to repay their national debts and restructure their financial systems)<br>  - Logistics (you can sometimes find business colleges in which you can specialize in logistics, and the UN really needs people to help it get supplies to all of the peacekeeping and development missions it has all over the world)<br>  <br>  Of course you can also study politics, but, as I said, then the competition for a job will be greater. There are also a few things you should know about the UN hiring process. They try to get equal geographic distribution in all of their departments at all levels. Because most applicants to the UN come from North America and Western Europe, that's where the competition is the highest (if there are 10 jobs in a department, they try to get for example 2 Africans, 1 Middle Easterner, 2 Asians, 2 South Americans, 1 Eastern European, and 2 North Americans / Western Europeans. It's not like they have an exact formula like what I just said, but that's just to give you an idea of how they try to divide things up. Since fewer South Americans apply than North Americans, the South Americans' chances of getting a job are greater). So if you're from the United States then, unfortunately, you have a little bit of a disadvantage. You can make up for that disadvantage by qualifying yourself through languages, areas of specialty, study abroad programs in college (NOT to Western Europe!! Most colleges have programs in Asia, some even in Africa - you're better off trying those), etc.<br>       You should also know that the UN hiring process is notorious for taking forever and a day. It typically takes 6 months for them to even get back to you, so if you want a job just out of college, apply early or be prepared to wait!! <br>  <br>  Good luck and, like I said, don't let yourself be discouraged by the negative comments you read here.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Definitely learn at least one of its "working languages."  The working languages are English, French, and Spanish. <br>  <br>  Here's a pretty good description of the process and what you'll need:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Job-With-the-United-Nations" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Job-With-th...</a>|`|lEaT5q06aa	grow up quick<br>  with any luck the UN will be defunct in a few years|`|Pd4Fh0Ymaa	Don't listen to the ones that say you must learn a language to join, the biggest authorities in there can't even speak English to save their lives.<br>  <br>  Just learn to do politics, to talk all kinds of polished rubbish while saying nothing.<br>  But  I think there might not be such a beautiful world for you to be in when you grow up.

Again not technically "taking" your Second Amendment right away, just making it too expensive to own a weapon. It only hurts the innocent gun owner.

You can't license a 'right', only a privilege.

So too is the ammo registration bills, the talk of taxing ammo out of existence and the bill your talking about with the insurence.<br>  <br>  Reading some of the other answers here, this question is a perfect example of how split the nation is. Gun banners on one side gun owners on the other and at each other's throats. Both sides bordering fanaticism and once fanaticism starts blood will spill. Yet they still attack gun ownership knowing full well it will lead to such splits in society. From an objective standpoint somebody reading this should worry a great deal about the near future of the US.

He is destroying our Nation and our freedoms.  I loved America and knowing that I had a choice and could make the decisions that I wanted for my life.  Obama believes in Socialism and thinks the Government should be in charge and make the choices for me and the rest of the Country.  He believes in raising taxes and spending and is putting more pressure on the people to pay for things we cannot afford.  The stimulus package will not help us get jobs or be in better shape.  We are in for a major Depression with all the spending and with the lack of knowledge on what we are getting.  Obama made sure that there wasn't time to even read the bill before he demanded that it be signed and his cronies (the Dems and Libs who had the responsibility to read it before signing it) didn't take the opportunity to read the contract but signed it anyway.  Would you sign any contract for anything (house, car, etc.) without reading the details??  Not if you have half a brain!!  Now Obama wants to have another bunch of money spending bills approved.  He has no experience dealing with foreign nations; he has very little experience at anything.  Obama had presented all kinds of ideas for CHANGE in our lives and he IS changing the Country as we knew it.  He is going to start revamping the health care system and it will not be a good thing.  So far, Tom Daschle has put forth a bunch of socialist ideas that Obama loves.  The government will be in charge of the choices for medical care; not the doctor and patient.  The government will give the approval on what services you can receive and if they think the cost is too high for you to receive the care.  The doctor cannot persuade the choice.  Read Tom Daschle's book; look into it.  This is the truth and people are not getting it.  Too many think that Obama will save the Country and make us better but they haven't got a clue.  They didn't do their research when it came to voting and they aren't doing their research now.  Obama wants a dictatorship; not a democracy.  He is slowly but surely removing your choices and getting away with it.  People need to wake up, get informed and voice their opinions before it is too late.  We are on a steady slide downward.  Obama is an empty suit and a very, very dangerous man.  This presidential choice is the worst America has every known.  History will show that this is true.  God help us all.

If not then it is like dialing 911 as a crank call. By doing it when you do not need help you degrade its effectiveness as a distress signal and may prevent someone in need from receiving the help they need. Therefore it is immoral.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	Since it is genrally regarded as a sign of distress I would see it as a mis-application....much like calling 911 to complain about Burger King or storming into a hospital emergency room for a headache.<br>  <br>  At best it seems a bit immature and at worst the person is exploiting "distress" for pure, self-agrandizing posturing.
3LRhCH0baa	Do you have a shred of compassion for fellow humanbeing?<br>  <br>  "don't give me "brutal communist treatment" or "lack of religious freedom," "<br>  - What are you talking about?

Deal with it!!<br>  <br>  As far as Tibet goes, the Chinese invaded and conquered Tibet.     China is a vast country, and didn't need to conquer and oppress these people, as they are doing, now, in this time period.

The military service is NOT welfare. It's compensation for services rendered. If you work at McDonald's, you are not on welfare. Each job and organization dictates the compensation and benefits.

If you get wounded on the field, do you think they are going to send you a bill !!!!! (NO, BTW It would be covered under workers compensation in the private sector). Minimizing taxes is not tax evasion ! It is against existing laws to structure transactions as you claim UBS did. (See Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, etc.). Contracting out for weapons design is not welfare. It is two parties entering into a contract for goods and services. Halliburton is one of the largest companies that are available to provide these type of contract services. You wouldn't want to hire McDonald's to do a Halliburton job.  Just because Cheney worked at Halliburton previously, you cannot say that all Republicans had anything to do with these companies. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Cheney who PREVIOUSLY worked for the company did anything wrong.<br>  Tax cuts to the RICH?? How about all the tax cuts for the people that don't pay taxes - i.e. earned income credit, ss recipients, etc..

A misdemeanor, as long as no weapon was used (in most places).  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, shoplifting and theft laws are not federal, they are local laws and are different from city to city.

You have to probe that you guys are together for real, not for papers!|`|HrLbf25Paa	Well, the first task on schedule should be to consult an attorney regarding the status of your wife. The reason why is important to speak with an attorney is because it all depends on how your wife entered the United States. In case your wife entered the USA with a visa and her visa expired then assuming you are a US citizen you need to file for an I-130 which is a family petition and you also need to submit I-485 as well. You might want to check the website of the USCIS, for you will need to submit documents such as marriage certiicate, pictures , a copy of your citizenship, your son's birth certificate, copy of the last three filed taxes, copies of car insurance, medical, joint bank accounts etc. The purpose of these documents is to show that your marriage is legitimate. The more papers you have to support your marriage, the least an Immigration officer will question. Make sure you include a copy of her passport with all of the stamps and a copy of her I-94. Please be extremely careful when filling the application. Also make sure you submit a copy of your latest pay stubs.|`|AA11605508	First, if she is not here legally, she needs to leave the country immediately. If she is here legally, she needs to return home when her visa expires and return AFTER the fiance visa is processed.<br>  <br>  You will need to apply for a fiance visa. This will cost about $700 dollars, payable to the INS.  Once the paperwork is processed (anywhere from one to six months), she can return to the U.S. You two will have ninety days to marry.|`|jNG2eM3Taa	if she is mexican you just made a big mistake because they will **** anybody they dont care your brother your dad your uncle your granddad her people and so on 2years you probably wana go get checked out right now|`|I7piny88aa	She came here legally meaning that she  had a visa when she arrived? If so... after you get married, what you have to do is go to USCIS.gov and download some forms that you will send with a huge fee (it's like $1000). Then you will have to appear before an immigration officer and prove that your marriage is real (which should be easy considering that you have a baby.<br>  The forms are: I-130, G-325A, I-485, I-693, I-864, and I-765 if she needs employment authorization to get a social security.<br>  <br>  You can always get an attorney, but in your case it would be a waste of money. And no, she DOES NOT have to go back to her country if she came legally to the U.S. and has a I-92... best of luck!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	If "legally" means that she has an alien registration card, she has permanant residency, so she doesn't really have to do anything, except maybe change her name on her card and passport if she will be using your last name.|`|x0gM4Rwmaa	I assume the immigrant isn't a citizen. <br>  <br>  If she isn't, she will have to go BACK to her home country and you'll have to file a petition for your spouse to come here. You will have to be making more than 1.5x the US poverty level for a 2-person family. You'll have to pay for the petition, pay to get her to her interview once that comes, and you will legally be responsible for providing for her for 3 years after she gets here. <br>  <br>  The process takes a while. But no doubt about it, to file the necessary petition she has to go BACK to her HOME country. Sorry.

Well, it is. And the bailout Bush did was WRONG. I assure you that most of us do not and DID NOT agree with it.

BoAXvBW4aa	For some reason I think you think you know the answer to the question. There is two things about your rant that should be pointed out.<br>   <br>  First, the 700+ billion dollars (informally called TARP 2) doesn't go to "housing the foreclosed." TARP 2 is money that goes into the economy by shovel ready projects and other forms of government spending like unemployment benefits, city projects etc. The Obama administration is providing 75 billion to deal with foreclosures but, it is completely separate bill.<br>  <br>  Second, your argument is what scholars (and idiots alike) call a straw man fallacy. You should be arguing that the stimulus package itself is bad, you shouldn't say it is socialism and then attack socialism. So what if it is socialism? Why is socialism bad? How are our freedoms harmed if there are socialist elements in our society (i.e. SSI, unemployment benefits, etc.)?|`|1HhWfPIJaa	Roads are socialist. Schools are socialist. Hospitals that get any government money are socialist. NASA is socialist. Get over it. Wake up and see the world around you.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	It's obvious you're illiterate when it comes to economics...|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Left hand - nail.<br>  Right hand - hammer.<br>  Swing - you've hit the nail on the head.<br>  <br>  Bingo!|`|ffJcrsmLaa	Socialism : "any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods"<br>  <br>  If you can understand that definition, it is easy to see that this stimulus package is not "socialism". The government pays for a lot of things; I'm sure you would consider your local fire department a "socialist" institution, even though it is payed for by tax payers' money and controlled by the government. I don't have any problem with people not agreeing with the stimulus package, but calling it "socialism" is completely false.|`|cMHxg372aa	No, it's not socialism. Socialism is a system in which the government nationalizes or expropriates privately-held capital and directly plans production.<br>  <br>  The stimulus plan works within the context of the existing market system; ergo, socialism it is not. Ask a bona fide socialist or communist if they think it's socialism - they'll laugh at you, probably after calling Obama a stooge of the capitalist bourgeoisie.|`|de711i5Vaa	It is certainly beginning to look that way. But then, Smart people knew that from the beginning. Idiot loons said otherwise.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	yes it is|`|HzVE4kz1aa	socialism, capitalism, it's all a wash of buzz words.  We have taxes in this country.  Taxes pay for our common good way of life.  We have police, clean streets, fire depts, schools, parks, etc.  We are now facing an economic crisis that rivals the Great Depression.  So would you suggest the financial markets be allowed to fail?  Then we're talking streets with businesses boarded up.  The middle class becoming the poor, the rich becoming the middle class, and the poor, well, they'll be in sprawling slums, gangs, crime. national guard coming in to shoot rioters.  Or we can buck up and go into debt.  Spend our way out of this.  That means we basically keep everything on par with debt, until the money acts as an investment creating future wealth.  The stimulus package is intended to preserve our mixture of capitalist/socialist programs.  Pure capitalism would be like India or something.  A few wealthy elite in gated communities, and sprawling slums where 'irresponsible' people make 2 cents a day.  I think another New Deal makes more sense.  It feels more Free.|`|40a37255449a9b40b7011ed1797f9b57aa	Who cares what it's called as long as it gets Americans back to work and this country on it's feet again.

Doesn't make it a difference<br>  <br>  If's still offensive|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I think you need a little clarification.<br>  Pelosi did not write the stimulus bill, this is something Obama sent to congress, which in the two houses, tweaked and changed some facets of it.<br>  The excuses are simply empty in fact,  The tragedy that left a woman maimed in Connecticut was also said to be the chimp.  That had nothing to do with it. Pelosi has been depicted as many things, chimp not being one of them. Then too, caricaturists when they did Bush as a chimp, used identifiable features.  This was a chimp, with the understanding that there would be no need to use the characteristics that have been used to illustrate Obama.<br>  There is no indoctrination at work here, the cartoon said what it meant, and it was racist since it used a stereotype popular since the civil war.<br>  Maybe you need a better sense of history.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	I don't have a problem with that view.. <br>  But, when people can't understand why some are offended and act as if they can't see how they could be? That's just weird.. <br>  <br>  I first heard the story on Republican radio. The first 15 minutes, they talked about how Obama was the chimp and it wasn't racist because it wasn't about Obama, it was about the stimulous.. Then a caller stated "it's obviously about congress".. The host's view changed all of a sudden.. From then on, he stated that the chimp was the congress, not Obama.. You lose crediblity doing things like that..|`|ntuJzqycaa	I thought they were still talking about Bush.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	their all a bunch of horses asses. but if their is a chimp, i guess obama with those goofy ears would resemble it the most.|`|2BWyZOy5aa	The chimp refers to all communist scum that wrote and supported that bill|`|ZWXFyULsaa	the jews are trying to switch the blame

Yzb44aV6aa	Yes...but he wont.|`|AA10284358	and another one bites the dust This seems to be an epidemic of Obamas carefully picked people jumping the fence or forced out.<br>  Not a good sign.This speaks volumes of the dear leader.Oh well you still have Hillary in there smiling. Would love to see her with the chinese leader. Bet it was hard trying to act like she knew what she was talking about. Can just see her telling the chinese leader to straighten up his act on his finance juggling.Will we ever get to hear what she really said. Doubt it.Where is she going now is it to Obama's home land. That should be interesting. Oh well I guess we can afford to pay for her getting to see the world. If we can handle the stimulus I guess we can handle her travels. Oh I heard the dems. now want to tax the miles we travel not the amount of gas we use. Make sense. Not sure i understand the logic but then I don;t understand anything they do. Happy trails.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Yes.  The Senate Democrats were dumb to let him in anyway.  You know that anything connected to Gov. B. was going to be dirty.  They let the black community and Republicans bully them into it.  Idiots!|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Yes he should. He was appointed by a corrupt governor and has now been caught lying about his contact and fund raising for Blago. He needs to just step down.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	he sounds like he's lying to me.  I have a nose for these things.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Why? He purchased that seat fair and square!

I know because I live here.|`|EOPD0ftfaa	Nah he should snuggle down it the bed With Obama and Blagojevich and get comfy!|`|KVMJ7wSXaa	Ya he needs to.  He has to wait to call Michale Jackson to ask for some advice.|`|n1hnIBdeaa	Yes he should,Gov urges him to leave and so do some church officals.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	yes, but he is consulting jessie jackson and uncle al sharpton first...|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	He's another crook.|`|YaTgrhr9aa	Yes his goose is cooked well done|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes, he should. But he is less likely to do so than Bill Clinton is to stop staring at women.|`|AA11313983	Yes.  The problem with corrupt politicians, however, is that they almost never admit to being corrupt.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Yes.  He lied to get there.  But he has no integrity, and will not voluntarily resign.  Hopefully, the voters of Illinois will send his ratty old *** packing when the seat comes up for election.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Those who know him say that his ego is as big as his house so any chance of him resigning looks pretty slim.  Problem with that dude is that he knew he was lying from day one and like so many around Hussein, he though he could get away with it.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Yes but like Gov.

Following McCain's adultry, Reagan rarely spoke with the man.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Reagan took over a bad economy and fixed it by reminding Americans that we only succeed  when government isn't standing in the way. He lowered taxes, got the government out of the way, and a hideous economy was replaced by a bustling economy. Within two years.<br>  <br>  Obama is doing the opposite. We are constantly informed that if we don't do what he says immediately we will all be doomed, and if we don't fork out all our earnings and the future earnings of our children to his government, the crisis will get worse.<br>  <br>  Reagan didn't like Communists or Totalitarian governments, incidentally.|`|3uH441n3aa	The black Jimmy Carter|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I think he would have a hearty chuckle...|`|zEVpA4WCaa	IF HE WERE ALIVE HE MIGHT SAY LET JOHN HINKLEY OUT OF JAIL.

A contradictory position from today's right wing extremists who have highjacked Reagan's GOP.    <br>  <br>  And you must also remember; like him or not, Reagan had more class in his little finger than most of the whole of the herd of extremists who now call themselves "Republicans."  And that includes the naysayers,  hatemongers and sore losers who post here on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  President Reagan would have seen him as first, an American President due respect for the office he holds, and second a member of the loyal opposition.  In other than the contentious heat of a political campaign, his class would have shown - something many here would do well to emulate.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	President Reagan would probably think President Barack Obama is the actor in a travel advertisement.

Yes, President Reagan is rolling over in his grave!|`|A2qbzxrfaa	Definitely, Reagan HATED communism/socialism.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Reagan would have just stared at him and slobbered on himself.....|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	Probably.|`|IFVrLCNOaa	He would say 'well, there you go again' just like he said to Carter in the 1980 debate. hahahahaha<br>  <br>  And, he would tell Eric Holder to go shove.. He'd recite his Point Du Hoc speech from 1984 in Normandy where he recounted our courageous Ranger veterans in WW2 scaling the cliffs to secure the beach head. And, then Reagan will put Holder in his place by showing that our nation is not a nation of cowards !!!!!!!|`|sI3kqp7xaa	"We the people" tell the government what to do, it doesn't tell us. "We the people" are the driver, the government is the car. And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast.

Our Constitution is a document in which "We the people" tell the government what it is allowed to do. "We the people" are free.<br>  -Ronald Reagan<br>  <br>  He would be very upset with the direction our country has taken, but he warned us that our freedoms are very fragile.<br>  <br>  Too many of us Americans were seduced by Liberalism, and abandoned the virtues of our Founding Fathers.|`|GbeF6gQuaa	He would be more shocked to see how quickly we forgot and flushed away the  hope and prosperity he gave us.

It's redundant.  Just "exaggerate" would cover it.

di43MlSFaa	The only thing that I can think of regarding this would be perhaps the tax cuts might help in getting larger corporations to hire more people here, instead of outsourcing by bringing in foreigners on work visa's, utilizing the H-1B visa hubs, or sending work out to be done in other countries. A majority of the large businesses do that, including banks. With so many unemployed here in this country, they should be hiring our workers first, but want a cheaper way out. So perhaps tax cuts for them might be incentive because it's going to be more difficult for them to request visa workers now.<br>  One would hope that our companies here would hire citizens first, but clearly that is not always the case.<br>   <br>  Tax cuts for smaller businesses might help them to thrive more, but I don't see it as an incentive to hire for the small business owner, but a break so that they have a better chance to survive and grow.  I don't think small business is going to be doing much hiring, but hunkering down to weather the storm so to speak. A tax break for them might be of assistance in that regard.<br>  <br>  These are links for informational purposes about the use of workers on visa's.<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090201/ap_on_bi_ge/bailout_foreign_workers">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090201/ap_o...</a><br>  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123517509078737427.html?mod=article-outset-box" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12351750...</a><br>  <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/02/20/tech-cos-to-h-1b-workers-we-feel-your-pain/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Economy/idUSTRE51I60N20090219" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Econo...</a>|`|de711i5Vaa	so we should print money left and right and give it away to people who don't deserve it instead?

KJZol6Gpaa	Bush is blamed instead of Obama because the press is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democrat party.  Obama, Pelosi & Reid lie constantly, but the press gives them a pass, every time.  Bush was consistently, perhaps obsessively, truthful, and never got credit for it.<br>  <br>  The truth is that Democrats mostly caused this mess.  The Democrats have been in charge of budget and tax matters for just over two years, and strongly influenced them even before that.  It was Clinton and the Democrats who rewrote the Community Reinvestment Act to pressure banks into making dangerous subprime mortgage loans, and it was Democrats in Congress (including Obama) who took big donations from Fannie & Freddie to protect them from the regulatory oversight that Bush had been advocating since early in his first term.  Now Fannie & Freddie's investment in Obama has paid off -- they are to get $200,000,000,000 dollars from the taxpayers, or nearly $2700 per American family of four.<br>  <br>  The Obama/Democrat "stimulus" and "shock treatment" won't help the economy.  It is more of the same discredited Keynesian policies that enabled Hoover & FDR to stretch the 1930-31 recession into a decade-long depression, and enabled Nixon and Carter to give us "stagflation," with the addition of nearly-unprecedented borrowing for an astonishing amount of wasteful pork, and a few other modifications.  One modification is that, thankfully (so far) they are not proposing to duplicate the Hoover/FDR protectionist policies; that will make it less destructive.  Another modification is the stimulus bill's disastrous, radical, deadly new government healthcare "reforms" (translation: throwing grandma under the bus), passed in the dead of night with no debate at all.<br>  <br>  The economy has just one big thing going for it.  It’s not Obama’s misnamed “stimulous” package, that's for sure.  It is oil!  The price of oil is finally back to normal levels.  When oil was 4x its normal price, the cost was bleeding the Western economies white.  Staunching that flow will give a big boost to the American, European & Japanese economies.<br>  <br>  And do you know WHY oil prices came down?  It is because we (thanks to Bush & Patreaus) won the Iraq war!  The defeated Iraqi insurgents no longer have the ability to disrupt Iraq's oil production.  The result is that Iraq's oil exports increased by a factor of TEN (yes, 10x) from the summer of 2007 to the summer of 2008, and ANOTHER factor of 3.5x since then.  They are now near historically normal export levels.  That increased supply of oil to the international market ended the shortage and brought the price down.<br>  <br>  But the press -- the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Democrat Party -- will never tell you that.  That would violate the first rule of American journalism: never, EVER give President Bush credit for anything.|`|3ydkcGyoaa	Actually Bush is not the cause for this down turn.  Actually we were only officially in a recession when the 4th quarter 2008 GDP was released.<br>  <br>  Jimmy Carter passed a housing act which did not do too well.  Bill Clinton passed law requiring lenders to lower down payment requirements and give loans out to people who would not normally qualify.  The banks were forced into this.  After a few years of this banks found ways to make money off of the bad loans buy grouping them in with good loans in mortgage backed securities.  As the foreclosures started to rise, the securities went south.<br>  <br>  The only mistake Bush made was pushing the bailout that did not work and appointing a socialist as treasury secretary.<br>  <br>  I am tired of everyone blaming Bush.  He was getting blamed before he took office.  The stock market has declined 18% since Obama was elected.  Prior to the election the market was making a slight recovery.  It has now declined more than it did when the market had its downturn in September 08.<br>  <br>  Additionally if you look at when Obama makes speeches regarding the economy or anyone from his administration, the stock market plummets even more.<br>  I am tired of people saying this is the worst crisis since great depression.  The depression had double digit unemployment and double digit negative GDP at times.  I see no evidence of a recession in many places in the country.  Restaurants are packed as well as home improvement stores.  These are things that you cut in a recession or do less of.  <br>  Secondly, Barney Frank keeps saying that the mortgage ‘crisis’ is the failure of the free market.  This actually is not true.  Had it been a free market, the banks would have not ever had to give loans to people with no income to support it.  <br>  The reason that Bush gets blamed?  Because democrats don’t want to take the fall.  Get you facts straight before you start blaming people.  How could Bush have stopped this from happening?  He was not in control of the banking industry.  You need to look at folks like Barney Frank who are and have been in that position.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	bush had nothing to do with the economic problem (its not even that bad the dems just make it worse by makeing it seem worse ) its a mental game the more people go out and spend the better the economy is the worse the economy is its beacuse the people arnt spending , and when people are told the economy is bad they stop spending and that just drives it further down <br>  and obama is going to screw this country up worse then carter|`|7tny7w5Raa	amen thank you so much. nuff said. oh and to spud the last 8 years i had no problem with my job (40+) hours a week and just in the last two months I'm lucky to get 16 hours a week. you tell me. no better yet save your breath. you voted for him i would rather not breath the same air you do.|`|eR2rrcJcaa	cause he's black!! and u know, u cant say anything against black ppl, that's plain rude. plus, if the dems keep blaming bush, then they might have a chance 2 win the next 4 years. if they don't blame bush, then they r screwed :D|`|fa0KZ6bMaa	Because it is easy to teach moron liberals to just say "it's Bush's fault" than to expect them to actually use their brains and question their own kind who are really sinking us.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Because Obamites use Bush the way christians use Satan.

Start holding the CURRENT president accountable for his actions people, or have no freedom to do so later. It's not looking good. And you can point your finger backwards ALL DAY LONG...but sorry.

But after deregulation, the bankers and brokers went completely nuts, and got too greedy for their own (or anyone else's) good. <br>      It is also partly the buy-now-pay-later mindset of consumers. People bought houses they couldn't afford, and cashed in their equity to install pools and new kitchens and bathrooms, they were starry-eyed from all the home reno shows on the idiot box. There was a time, not that long ago, that being in debt was a shameful thing. <br>      There needs to be an overhaul in the way that banks and brokerages and other financial institutions do business. Maybe a course in ethics and the law should be included in every university MBA program. There is a very nasty sense of entitlement amongst many executives these days.<br>       At any rate, everybody needs to overhaul the way they spend their money.

It depends where you live.  I used to live in Texas where there was no party registration.  You could theoretically change from year to year which primary you voted in, the only rule was that you could only vote in one party's primary per election.  If they need to declare you one or the other for official reasons, such as the year that I assisted with the recount of ballots and they wanted people to work in teams of one Democrat and one Republican, and I was asked to volunteer because I was involved with the county Democratic Party, it comes from something like that -- because you're involved with the formal political structure and people know you.  <br>  <br>  I'm from New York, and I live in New York again now, and here, you have to register with a party or you don't vote in a primary at all.  You have to be a registered Democrat to vote in the Democratic primary, and a Registered Republican to vote in the Republican primary.<br>  <br>  So, you'll have to call the Board of Elections in your county, wherever that is, and ask if it's the practice to register with a party where you are.  If they seem confused, say, "For example, if I wanted to be a registered Democrat, could I be a registered Democrat here?"  Or you could Google your county B of E and probably find that information.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  Republicans here, do you really want to perpetuate the notion that Republicans are stupid rednecks?

I can say I hate his policies.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Racism!|`|AA10066516	I dont hate him, I hate what he is doing to this country.|`|FiYX5elCaa	wow, where do i start. "people that hate hm should go to jail" people like you are downright scary. you are the thought police from orwells 1984. fyi bush was called hitler and much more, they commonly referred to him as the chimp!, dare you call obama a "chimp!". this man has enslaved our sons and daughters with a crushing debt. all within the first month in office! and he still has a 60% approval rating!<br>  you can say wake up before its too late, gues what, its way too late! you would think that californias financial crisis would be a warning, unfortunately our federal government dosnt seem to notice and is rapidly heading down the same path. when inflation is at 20%, 50%, 100%, 1000% maybe we will wake up. always remember, the people get the government they diserve. unfortuatly our inattentiveness comes at a great cost. to be seen.... socialism has been a failure, unfortunately those we chose to formulate policy dont seem to be students of history, unfortunately we tend to pick the charismatic orator, the empty suit whos ego was been inflated by a shell of boot lickers and yes men. were paying the price already and its only 1 month into the new era!<br>  <br>  those of you who cry racism are baiters. gw appointed the first black national security advisor, the first black secretary of state, the first black female secretary of state(in fact bush's highest cabinet member for the entire time he/she was in office was black, the face of america to the rest of the world. condi rice and c powell.). the first hispanic attorney general alberto gonzalez. clinton is often referred to as the first "black president", why? gw bush appointed more minorities in power than clinton or any other president before, yet he's hated just because of people like you who follow the mainstream media, hate bush dogma. please, read a book, try to think for yourself instead of being spoonfed the hate bush rhetoric. this is what happens when ignorant populism reigns.<br>  <br>  BTW i think its ironic, almost to the point of being amusing, that the very people that voted him into office(21-35) are the ones that will pay the biggest price, you'll have this crushing debt to pay back!, he's YOUR president, dont blame me!!|`|RhDPB70Baa	Obama is a socialist.

Why don't you run down to the book store and buy mr. obamas auto biography hun and read it front to back, let it soak in good ....if you can read that is.<br>  He admits socialist ideology and is a firm follower of marx and lennon (hugo chavez does too). Our complete way of life and unalienable rights hinge on a government appointed to protect it AND citizens to make sure the government does it. Socialism subsidizes free market, nationalizes health care and workforce. In simple words, they control what you do, when you do it and how you do it. Grab a history book and dig deep into it and you'll find many countries that used the same ideology and it always failed. It's a good concept, spread the wealth but think if a doctor got paid the same as someone who flips burgers, how do you think your health care will be then???<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "People who don't like him should go to jail?"

OfPQVR1Naa	Unfortunately, teachers are not usually the smartest of people... I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but it's true.  It goes back to the old adage, "Those who can't DO, teach".  (And those who can't teach work in politics).<br>  <br>  There's no laws against being ignorant.  There is, however, a system in place that can remove this teacher from her job.  That system starts with you (and all your classmates) voicing your concerns to your parents.  <br>  <br>  It's unfortunate, but the school board really doesn't care what you think about your teacher.  They DO care what your parents think.  If they get enough complaints about a teacher (from parents), she will be dismissed.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents what you've seen and get your classmates to tell their parents.  Tell them you're worried she's turning you into a left-wing pansy.|`|jpqSnCpuaa	She is a leftist socialist (if she likes obama).  what a fool.  i have multiple guns.  i have never killed a person and neither have any of my guns.  next time she starts that crap just say "a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  that is the second amendment.  if she still has a problem tell her to discuss it with the founding fathers who thought this to be such an important right that it was the second one that they thought to put in the bill of rights.  if she is still being stupid talk to your parents and have them talk to her.  if that does not work go to the principal.  that will work, trust me.|`|AA11813034	you need to bring this up to someone, your parents need to know and so does the principal. this is completely unacceptable.

AfaFCiKxaa	Given the fact the we're using the world's resources far faster than the earth can provide them, some of us consider it an injustice for anyone to have a lot of kids.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you seem to have a very distorted idea of how much money people on welfare get from the government.  Do a little research and then figure out if you'd be able to live on it before you get too worked up.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Why do you believe that people 1) have more children for more benefits 2). receive more benefits for each additional child? <br>  <br>  You  should really study up on this issue before whining about it. The VAST majority of people on social welfare have 1 child. At 3 children, nearly EVERY state in the union no longer increases benefits based on the number of children. <br>  Since MOST states do not cover contraception for medicaid users, you are both asking the government to regulate morality AND pay more to allow these people access to monthly birth control pills. <br>  There is NO money for social aid for impoverished children. The only things provided for are WIC and medicaid. If a child is disabled, he may receive more money. All children, by age 5, are taken off of WIC, and most are removed from medicaid as well. The average time a child is on welfare in the US is 2 years. <br>  I LOVE  how your side cares so much about fetuses, but NOT AT ALL about living children in poverty. 3 million foster children are on welfare, as they don't have parents who can care for them. I'm certain you would have rather they been aborted.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Bill Clinton reformed welfare back in the 90's|`|gau0w8LMaa	They did something like that by instituting some regulations. If a woman on assistance becomes pregnant she cannot receive more for that child or was kicked out of the system all together.  <br>  <br>  Obama has basically undid that with his stimulus program. Telling states they cannot lower their welfare rolls is black-mail.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	I'm guessing you are a republican and thus against BIG Government...isn't it a bit Hypocritical to think that government should limit the number of kids a person can have?  hmmmm|`|r6JskEtxaa	Have you read the book "Among the Hidden"<br>  <br>  It's all about this topic. <br>  <br>  We aren't China|`|Eo8I3fbnaa	What about an aplication to have kids also. Where do you stop. But seriously I know some people you can start with. But 1st we need to give birth control and teach sex education in High schools so that we can stop babies from having babies. Teach parenting classes. I'm tired of people I know having kids into poverty.|`|ExCAedp4aa	Why? Because the idea of people having children just to increase welfare payments is nothing more than Republican mythology.|`|ntuJzqycaa	You can't limit kids in a free country.<br>  <br>  But you can encourage them to abort.<br>  <br>  You know, a few $$$? See what I'm sayin'?|`|9npIzlHKaa	Because we are not communist China.|`|y46jyjGKaa	Because each welfare cow is a future voting base.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I agree. People need to be responsible and only have the kids they can afford!|`|UpZFb6X5aa	For two reasons.<br>  First, contrary to the lies of the conservatives, MOST women on welfare are married women whose husbands abandoned them. So the arguement about "welfare mothers having lots of kids" is invalid. Those are the facts, and no amount of racist propaganda from the right will change one fact. Never has and never will.<br>  <br>  The second reason is this is a fre countrry--not a Communist dictatorship like China--which is the only country thatwhere the government tries to tellpeople how many children they have.<br>  <br>  Interesting. Now why do you suppose the so-called "conservatives" admire and endorse COMMUNIST methhods and values?
8152BLMSaa	I appreciate your question frustrated citizen, as your perspective perception should be more well rooted in every American citizen at this current point in time. Your reference of the American Revolution and how it was brought about by a British monarchy's flagrant disregard for colonists rights is truer now than it has been since the Vietnam War. <br>  <br>  We are brought up to associate patriotism and allegiance to the government as being interchangeable, when they should be viewed not only separately but in contrast to one another. As it is, the government does not grant liberties or freedoms, but they are the single most institute that stands in the way of the aforementioned. Before there were governments, people were free to do as they wished without the consequences of an institute dictating how they should live their life, or what they can or cannot do. <br>  <br>  Only through mass ignorance and public misconceptions placed upon our nations citizens at a young age are most people brought up to believe that our liberties and freedoms are singular and unique onto ourselves, often without knowing anything about other societies or governments throughout the rest of the industrialized and civilized world. It would seem that our freedoms and liberties would be extended and be made looser as time came on, but still we find ourselves at odds with a government based on a piece of paper written over 200 years ago. <br>  <br>  When this country was founded, many politicians of the newly founded nation were against the forming of a central government extending to all thirteen colonies, because they feared it would become much too powerful and invasive someday (as they had just rid themselves of the British, whose invasive and oppressive manner brought about the call for revolution in the first place). It is in the nature of governments and institutions themselves to become more oppressive and controlling over longer periods of time. In recent times, I've seen police vehicles in the suburbs that have license plate readers attached to the roofs of their cars, in order to detect anyone on the road who may have a warrant out for their arrest, or just an ordinary citizen who may have an outstanding parking fine they forgot about. I find this to be entirely invasive, along the lines of Big Brother in George Orwell's 1984. Before you know it, police vehicles will have face readers which will set off alarms if you are an unregistered citizen or something else. It is a shame, through the marvels of technology and conformity our liberties and freedoms will continually degrade, and the average citizen of the future will probably face more scrutiny than a level three sex offender in the 90's. Our only source of salvation will be a piece of paper written hundreds of years ago, that is unless the government finds ways to work around it, or brings about legislative measures that bypass it (like the Patriot Act). <br>  <br>  As our nations third President Thomas Jefferson once said, "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." This shouldn't be taken literally in the modern day world we live in but nonetheless the message is the same to all people who pride themselves on being American citizens. Non-violent social revolutions should be encouraged from an early age, as a way to counteract the oppressive and restrictive natures that all governments exhibit onto its citizens over a long enough period of time. A citizens only true freedom in our society is knowledge, and the ability to act upon the social injustices being exhibited by ones government through legal means, actions and ventures.|`|2BWyZOy5aa	It died when we allowed a communist illegal alien half breed kenyan to become President.<br>  <br>  You can't expect to keep any freedoms under black marxist leadership.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	No.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	No government can force people to buy things (including homes) they cannot afford.  But with unprecedented freedom the people went out and did that anyway.  A dozing, disinterested government allowed banks to exercise their freedom to be as greedy and/or dumb as they wanted.  Hence the bad debt.<br>  If the government starts putting on controls, they are only doing what parents ought to do when their kids have run riot. Hopefully, common sense will return and freedom will return with it.|`|y1MpW4sEaa	The hope for freedom is not dead, I will have my freedom until I take my last breath.<br>  <br>  Many people in this world do not want to be ruled by dictators, and soon the day will come when we will rise up to throw out the few corrupt who ruin this country and opress our freedoms. A day is soon to come when we will be our own leaders.<br>  <br>  America is the land of the free, and it shall always be as long as the stars shine.|`|trMsK86jaa	Freedom is one of those things that can never be killed.<br>  <br>  It's part of the chaotic nature of it, y'see?<br>  <br>  Freedom can be found anywhere, but you have to fight if you want to find it Everywhere.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Disappointment is a sin.

Your comparison would be more accurate as follows.<br>  <br>  Your neighbor walks around his house for hours dousing the house with gasoline, even though countless people have told him that such a thing is dangerous. And he borrowed the money to buy the gas by putting it on his nearly maxxed out credit card. Then, lights a cigarette, smokes it,  and throws the cigarette on the house, igniting it. Then, just before it is almost completely engulfed, at least beyond the hope of any fire rescue at all, he calls 911. Then, two thousand armed troops show up and force at gun point all neighbors within 20 miles to come to this guy's house and try to put the fire out with cups of water while waiting for the Fire trucks to respond. The house completely burns down, and the firemen can do nothing. So the 2000 armed troops force the neighbors to rebuild the house at gunpoint while the original owner gets a fully paid good night's rest at the nearest 5 star hotel complete with complimentary breakfast. So no, I don't think my tax dollars should be spent keeping his house from burning down.<br>  <br>  You are a fool if you support rewarding this kind of behavior.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	The gov't should pay for the army, police, fire dept., prisons and maybe schools.

0Ad0SrEfaa	“Naturally the common people don’t want war. But after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it’s always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. <br>  <br>  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.”<br>  <br>     --- Hermann Goering, Hitler’s Reich Marshall, at the Nuremberg<br>  Trials after World War II.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	You have to keep the masses confused to keep them in line.

AA11622716	For the reasons described in the article, alcoholism is not a crime and is not punished as a crime.  Only the act of driving while under the influence is a crime.  Similarly, being addicted to drugs is not a crime, but actually possessing the drugs is a crime.  The disease provides the motive- the desire to commit the crime.  The criminal law requires people to respond to their motives in a non-criminal fashion.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	No,they are not protected by the ADA...<br>  <br>  This BS has already been to the Supreme Court.|`|AA10349002	I disagree with the whole non sense about Alcoholism being a disease.

They are a direct threat to public safety.  <br>  <br>  How about a compromise?  If Alcoholics want to be protected under the ADA (virtually granting them permission to Drive Under the Influence) then they should be required to surrender their driver licenses.
5Ys3GvpFaa	It's a shame, but many people simply aren't comfortable with freedom.|`|3MM64geHaa	They feel threatened by people who think the govt should stay out of our lives. Some of them are a little extreme. There are those who would legalize meth and other drugs bc it is the individual's right to screw up. Many of them are soft on national security.  But they do have some good ideas.  Neal Boortz is a libertarian.  Read his page and listen to him and you will get a good idea of what they are. John Stossel of 20/20 is also a libertarian|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Because they aren't mentioned in the mainstream media.  The Libertarian platform is completely sensible.<br>  <br>  People will get a clue when the economy crashes.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	After Obama is through they should look even more appealing.|`|D0KZiRBbaa	To Phillip H above.  I think that there are many Libertarians out there that make good logical arguments in debates.  Ron Paul (though not officially a Libertarian may as well be one) brought up these arguments in a logical way in the debates and was laughed at, ridiculed or ignored by the other candidates, the media and the opposing party as well.  When he discusses blowback and 911...during one of the debates (with Rudy G. being the foil) he was at first laughed at...then Rudy G. came in with a false sense of bravado and feigned astonishment at Dr. Paul's answer.  Then was apparently so offended by the statement that he asked Dr. Paul if he wanted to remit his statement?!  However, Dr. Paul's response was based on the writings and findings of the 911 Commission Report as well as the written opinions of numerous government and intelligence agency experts.  Yet, it was seen as "whacky" just based upon Rudy G's response.  Pathetic.|`|3FtC9D40aa	I think what I like about the libertarian ideal is the concept that the initiation of force should always remain tempered by the rule of law.<br>  <br>  Everything that libertarians believe stems from one piece of natural truth. That force will always create more of itself and that the outcome will always be a disaster. It is from that idea that libertarians strongly feel that you cannot promote charity by initiating force, and isn't that what taxes really are? Forced charity? If you don't believe me. Stop paying your taxes and see how long it takes before you go to jail. Once in jail your would have to worry about being beaten and stabbed or raped. <br>  <br>  So knowing this my hunch would be that realistically you would pay your taxes to avoid this. In fact. Could one argue that you were actually terrorized into paying your taxes? That you were threatened with the initiation of force?<br>  <br>  I can understand why this makes people unhappy. People work hard for what money they can make and it irks them that thier money is taken without their consent. It isn't like the majority of people don't have plenty of bills of their own and thier own personal hardships. For that they have every right to be angry with the government and resentful of those who take without asking. <br>  <br>  Likewise they see how that money is just being wasted in vast layers of beauracracy. They see their dollars eroded as it is handed from layer to layer until ultimately only a few pennies are left for the people that the money was intended to help. <br>  <br>  I just don't see how the system we have now can remain. It just harms everyone it touches.|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	It's because what they say makes sense and contains alot of truth.|`|AA11086243	because they split the parties... they take the small gov. of the reps and personal freedoms of the dems...<br>  <br>  so, there is something for everyone to hate... and hate always rises to the top...|`|IFVrLCNOaa	Because it doesn't fit neatly into one of the two major parties.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	They are more politically grounded right now than either the dems or republicans.|`|A2qbzxrfaa	Because a FREE people means little or no power for the 534 apes that run this country.   <a href="http://fairtax.org" rel="nofollow">http://fairtax.org</a>|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	I think they are ok.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	I don't always agree with ever individual in ANY Political Party.<br>  Libertarians seem to be more agreeable than most from my viewpoint. <br>  The only "whacko" thing about them is their inability to come up with a good candidate who can make good logical arguments in debates.|`|e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	As the saying goes "the truth hurts." And Libertarians expose a lot of the lies the other two parties tell.<br>  <br>  And why try to compete with your opponents views when you can marginalize them, which is what they do to libertarians, and have the lap dog media help in doing so. It's a tactic right out of Saul Alinski's book for radicals.<br>  <br>  There's also a famous quote (and I'm paraphrasing here; horribly no doubt) along the lines of after many years of hearing lies and half truths, the sane man will be labeled a radical by the people. That description fits Ron Paul perfectly, a sane man with real answers being called a kook by many. If someone has the real quote I'd much appreciate it.|`|tvNkizDraa	Libertarians don't really fit into the partisan mold and that tends to be a bit disconcerting to the die-hard party faithful.  A Libertarian will occasionally be a staunch supporter of one party's issue, but just as staunchly support a different issue of the other party.  The Libertarian will be staunchly on your side, but only occasionally.  That's just not trustworthy to the party loyalists.<br>  <br>  Now watch the thumbs down... Libertarians think for themselves and believe that others are capable of doing the same. Often we are disappointed, but we do remain optimistic.<br>  <edit... wow, no thumbs down (yet).  Perhaps because I didn't include a good-natured Libertarian poke at the Dem and Rep party mascots.>

The only way to really screw yourself out of becoming an 03 is to volunteer to go "Open Contract" when you enlist.

owzmt7lDaa	The age of consent is 17 in Texas. A 17 year old in Texas is also allowed to leave their parent's residence without their consent, however your parents still most provide for you until you are 18 if you decide to return. <br>  The working age in Texas is 16, so if you have a steady job, then you would be able to leave anyway and find your own residence (the police wouldn't enforce taking you back). <br>  <br>  Also note that in order to be considered a 'runaway' (generally under 17) there is generally a 24-48 hour waiting period. If you are ever detained by the police after that point then you will simply be returned to your caretaker's residence.<br>  <br>  There really isn't much your mother can do provided you aren't detained by the police after 48 hours of leaving, then you will simply be returned to her.

otYOxmnuaa	Incentives do work:<br>  <br>  We own a cotton-gin (inoperable now) and we were able to change out the filtering system w/ the help of government incentives.  Had there been no incentive, we wouldn't have been able to do it as quickly.<br>  <br>  How about Charles Bronson and his space-craft?  The incentive was 1 million...that was part of the motivation to build his rocket.<br>  <br>  As for DSIRE -- I think incentives are more efficient than flat-out government backing.  Free-market enterprises do the planning first before pursuing any endeavor.  With the incentive, they have to make sure that have it absolutely correct or it'll cost them too much if they fail.  With government backing, it can become a guess and check game...the money keeps flowing.
2CPHm501aa	A little confused by your question. It appears your saying Military is your career choice, but then it also sounds like your saying civilian Police Officer and part time Military.|`|3xTNOevjaa	Join the Marines, better then National Guard and will definatly get you prepared for SWAT.|`|po0zxnt7aa	Well, you do know that to be a police officer, military or college experience will be a plus. Although some department they try to stay clear from prior service, especially military police, because it's hard to break down those with military experiences/habits.To be a SWAT member, you have to do patrol for a few years before you could apply for SWAT, which is demanding and quite a long process. As far as I know, increase in pay will vary with some department. In my opinion, if military is something you really want to do, then go for it. Have you heard of the program that the Army offers, PaYS. If you want to be a police officer after your service, they can get you an interview with a police department. Ask your recruiter about that. Good luck!

This is larger than the large plunge through September and October.  As Obama pumps more social wasteful spending plans into our economy our market will continue to decline.  <br>  <br>  The long term place for your money at 25 is in the stock market, even at this time.  Yes you will not lose money in bonds like you will in the stock marget, but you make a very small margin of money.  In time the stock market will start to go up and these are opportunities that you would miss if you are in bonds.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to find a financial specialist in your area.  Many companies will offer a free review.|`|losg6nY5aa	The stock market seems to be wary of the stimulus plan.  Bonds are safer than stocks right now but the question is what is your time frame.  Over the long haul stocks are better.  But we're talking 5-10 years from now.  If you have something you need to buy (car, house, etc.)  in the next few years then bonds may be the best way to go.

You will learn better.<br>  <br>  However, I will help you get started:<br>  <br>  This question is actually asking for an opinion. Whether or not a judge has too much discretion depends on who the judge is and where the judgment is occuring. <br>  <br>  One could say that judgment is fair if the judge exercises their authority fairly. For example, the female judge that sentenced OJ last year fairly exercised her power to punish him for his new crime while not inflicting punishment for potential past offenses (the murders).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you get started. Try researching on google.

8dc5NMexaa	The Court decree established that portion of retirement as your separate property.  If he did not receive a lump sum upon his retirement, and he is receiving monthly disbursements, part of the same is your separate property.  He is held to be a constructive trustee of your portion and he must deliver the same to you.  To route that portion of your separate property to you and not through him, you need to obtain a QDRO, a qualified domestic relations order, that will be submitted to the retirement plan administrator from his former employer.  The technicalities and complexities of QDRO's take many plan administrator's many months and in some cases greater than a year to draft as to being acceptable to each party, as being consistent with the Decree of Divorce, and being Ordered by the Court.  The QDRO has to be consistent with the decree of divorce, and the Court has no discretion to alter the QDRO to be anything but consistent with the Decree.  In the meantime, i.e. before you obtain the QDRO, you are making a demand on his monthly receipts of your share, and he will be obliged to send the same to you, and if he refuses, then at Court he will be ordered to pay them to you, plus interest, plus attorney's fees that are necessary for your efforts to obtain the same.  <br>  You will not be held to have given a gift to him of all of the present and future payments which are your separate property.  As to the prior receipts of your separate property portion of his retirement disbursements, there exists, from your stated facts, a question of fact of whether he tendered to you your portion of the retirement, and whether you refused the tender.  If any person attempts to give someone their property, and that the rightful owner of the property refuses to accept the same, then there exists a possibility depending on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the same, whether the "refusing to accept" party repudiated their rights to receive the same.  Then the question arises of whether he relied to his detriment on your actions and statements of refusal.  The manner and proof in which the last two stated issues are presented will present the court with a rather tough decision as to whether you have forfeited your separate property portion up to the time, but not later, that you sought to enforce the receipt of your monthly separate property disbursements.  Laches, as opposed to statute of limitations, is the delay in enforcement of legal rights to the extent that it would be inequitable to enforce that right against a party who relied upon the non-enforcement to their significant detriment.  At least to the present and future disbursements to him of your separate property portion, you will be entitled to; however the past payments, if no QDRO and if he tendered the payments to you and you refused to accept and if the surrounding facts and circumstances would support his significant detrimental reliance on your refusal, then the same is left to the manner and proof relevant to same as to whether they will be Ordered paid to you.  A stretched, but not too much, example would be if I tried to give you monies which were yours, and you said "no, use those monies for a room addition to your house for your grandmother, for she is in great need of shelter." then equity may rule favorably for me for I have detrimentally relied upon your actions and words.    A laches defense does not define a period of certainty for the nature of the case must be looked at in its entirety considering all of the facts and circumstances.  In some conceivable cases, laches could be as short as a month or as long as many years.|`|RfxyVIh4aa	Generally based on what is reasonable and fair.<br>  <br>  If this was ordered in the divorce decree, I would absolutely take this in front of a family court judge.  That you weren't married for ten years seems to be irrelevant.  If you weren't entitled to it, it wouldn't have been ordered in the decree.<br>  <br>  The worst the judge can do is say no - and then you're no worse off than you are now.  You definitely don't have to hire an attorney.  In fact, you will look a lot more sympathetic if you do this on your own.  (Judges are always more sympathetic with parties who do not have attorneys than with attorneys.)

Don't think for a second he intends on paying you.  Be proactive and file ASAP.  Since you bought the car from a dealer they have to honor the implied warranty that a car will do carry out its normal function for a reasonable amount of time.  (If they say there is no warranty, as is this case, tell them not to give you that BS---look up the Mag Moss Warranty Act.<br>  Sue them for everything, purchase price, loss of work, etc. Look they gave $500 as a partial---to me that is an admission of guilt.

If they took the car back, then you are entitled to the purchase price of the car (but probably none of the other expenses.<br>  <br>  If you still have the car, I'd be counting your lucky stars that you got $500 back.  Used cars sold by private parties are "as is" sales unless you get a SPECIFIC guarantee.  Them saying that you'd be able to make it home in the car is not sufficient.  This is not a specific guarantee that would allow you to void an "as is" sale.  (If you had asked:  Is the engine good?  Can you guarantee that will run for three months?  And they said yes, THAT would be a specific guarantee that would have been enforceable.)  This is a classic case of "buyer beware."  Buyers who purchase from private sellers are taking a risk if they don't have the car checked by a mechanic.<br>  <br>  My guess is that they talked to someone who gave them a run down of "as is" sales and you probably won't hear back from them.

KTM5JEkLaa	Sort of.  He wants to start a "civilian national security force" that is basically a national police force that also would use local law enforcement given special federal authority to enforce some federal laws.  I have also heard some talk about using National Guard and Reserve troops domestically as well, which really worries me more than the other.

The reason they are now talking about WANTING to build them is to test public opinion to see if they are ready to unveil them publicly.    Last I heard (about a year ago) they had over 80 camps built scattered across North America with the capacity to hold approx 1 million people each. Apparently they except to have to round up around 25% of the total US population in the near future. I wonder what they know that we don't...    These camps fall directly in line with Army Regulation 21035 otherwise known as the Civilian Inmate Labor Program (Civilian Inmate Prison Camps) which was first setup in early 2005.    You can read the Army Regulation for yourself on the official website here : http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210...    I would HIGHLY recommend you read this and search for the keyword "MEDIA" and read those paragraphs. I think you will see exactly how hush hush this program was until now.    I think this quote says it all...  ---  "First they came for the communists,  and I did not speak out because I was not a communist;  Then they came for the socialists,  and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist;  Then they came for the trade unionists,  and I did not speak out  because I was not a trade unionist;  Then they came for the Jews  and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew;  Then they came for me...  and there was no one left to speak out for me."  ---  ~Martin Niemoeller - Prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII.    Enjoy your slavery!|`|BquqToGaaa	They are NOT civilian camps. They are REPUBLICAN RE-EDUCATION CAMPS.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	No.  The idea about civilian camps has no merit.  He wants to create a new version of the Peace Corps.  Anybody think those people were a "National police agency"?    http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/is...

Frank Figliuzzi of the Cleveland FBI and Mike Trivisonno on the Mike Trivisonno Show, WTAM 1100, 7/02/08, Hr. 2.    Caller - Do they perform background checks on candidates and fellows who are in Congress and the Senate and perhaps potential presidential candidates?.    FBI - The short answer is no, no we dont, but theyre given top secret clearances because theyre members of Congress, or Senators, or even higher ranking officials.    Host - Time out. There are no background checks from the FBI on the people that lead the country, the United States of America?.    FBI - Let me emphasize, elected officials. This is a democracy, the people have elected an official to represent them in Washington, and we do not routinely run background checks on those people.    Host - Even people running for president of the United States of America?.    FBI - Thats correct.    Host - Thats a little weird    FBI - Well, its part of democracy, its part of what the American people want, they want to be able to vote for somebody to represent them in Washington and they dont want us to get in the way of that and we have no predilection to get in the way of that.    Host - Yeah, but what if theyre voting for a bad person and they dont know that person is bad, do you follow me?. Im saying, if the guys got a background and maybe hes involved with some people that he shouldnt be involved with, shouldnt we know that as voters?.    FBI - Well, I think youd agree that the American political process is about as rigorous as youll ever see and if theres dirt back there, probably the opponent is gonna get it out probably before anyone else will."|`|c2hfVjxgaa	The spot light is showing his true colors.

By filing your own paperwork you don't need to hire an attorney or paralegal to prepare it for you, so you'll save a lot of money that way. All you'll need to pay after you've finished the paperwork is your state's filing fee. Which is usually around $25 but can be more.

Our products are shoddy, don't last, poorly designed, etc.  We need to fix those issues first.  Then people will want to buy the products.  Free enterprise when left alone, will resolve itself.  Mandating that we buy these products will not fix the problem.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Yes.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Obama doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.|`|spuz7DvNaa	NO!

If something can be negotiated, maybe.|`|HmNqCDsQaa	No, just keep buying cheap plastic crap from China and supporting Wal-Mart, that's the answer to everything.      That's said extremely sarcarstically|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	Maybe not 100% American, but we should think about where products come from.  There would be a trade backlash if we stopped importing items from other countries.    That being said, now if I see a label that says Made in China, I don't buy it unless I really need it and there's no alternative.  So far, I haven't "needed" anything made in China.

Making sure that any money spent does not remain here, in the USA, is far from conservative. But anyone suffering from republicanism doesn't have the ability to understand that.    Being a representative of the people of the United States and being more concerned about creating jobs, in foreign countries, than you are about creating jobs here, in the USA, is far from conservative. But, anyone afflicted with republicanism doesn't have the ability to understand that.    The first step to recovery is realizing you have a problem.

Colin Powel promised his wife that after he left the Cabinet he wouldn't take public office again. That's the long and short of it, and a 5 second google search will confirm what I just told you.    It had nothing to do with his endorsement since McCain was already the GOP candidate of record.

It's the "obstructionist" thinking of Pelosi, Dashole, Gephart and others that would make you think we could NEVER agree, and therefore lead to a question like this.    Steele hasn't agreed with Oshama YET... but when he does, we'll have to see WHAT/WHY he agreed on.    Powell was a DISGRACE.    Obama (and I dare you to disagree) offered us NOTHING of SUBSTANCE.  He was (and remains) an empty resume.   It was OBVIOUS that Powell endorsed him for RACIAL reasons, and for that, I think he SHAMED himself and reduced his character to that of "a typical black person".    BIG DIFFERENCE....|`|AA10725001	i wish i could throw trader powell under that bus me self!|`|PG2gd1tOaa	Uh partner, you have that a little backwards...Powell threw the Republican Party under the bus.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Oh...and the Dems treated Lieberman really well after he endorsed McCain...they almost KICKED him out of the PARTY...Officially!!!     I never swore I would vote for Colin Powell. Ever since he left office he has been a big whiny crybaby who needs attention. He has always been a liberal Republican, anyway. Wait 'til you guys see how Powell acts when he gets nothing for endorsing Odrama after betraying his party...just wait...he is a little prima donna...and now you are stuck with him...    I appreciate the fact that you recognize that Powell was a Republican leader (he's black, remember? guess we can't be racist).    Michael Steel is the leader of the Republican Party...how can he even BE thrown under a bus? He's the guy in charge! We are following his leadership.|`|goHKCuyraa	when you put "thoughts?" at the end of your rants does that mean they are absent?|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	Colin Powell slipped on a banana peel in the middle of the HOV lane in front of a bus just coming off an on-ramp.

He has run for 3 offices and in the first two he got the people running against him disqualified for not filling out something correctly on their applications. He became the only qualified political runner in 2 campaigns by simply waiting for the cut off date for applications and then pointing out the inaccuracies in the competition's paperwork.    Maybe he thought it was the only way he could win.|`|AA11847612	Steele is not running for any office. He is the chair of the RNC.

wOA2Mf6Naa	Bec republicans is all about appearance and not backbone.|`|AA11620976	An article of faith among the today's Republicans is that a loyal Republican always puts Party before Country.Powell is simply to much of a patriot to do that and so they attacked him and drove him out of the pack|`|4c7QomPoaa	I think you answered your own question.|`|IwBIM1tVaa	He contradicted his beliefs only because Obama was black that makes him a weak racist.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	He's what some would call a "snake in the grass"..|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	While an honorable man and fine leader, Powell is not a steadfast Conservative.  He is not now nor ever has been a disgrace.|`|AA11593971	I, for one, was not surprised by his endorsement. Powell has always had one foot on the GOP side of the aisle and the other on the Dem side. Like many generals (and, yes, I happen to know more than a few), Powell has a large ego and it got bruised badly by the Beltway insider criticism when he backed Bush in the Iraq War.     So I don't consider Powell a disgrace... just misguided.|`|qOqm6j2Saa	He was a dove before so in my opinion he wasn't worth bird poop to the administration.|`|AA11481889	He's a conservative that went for the other team...and contradicted his own beliefs ....just because Obama is the same race as he is.    It's disgraceful to abandon your entire moral code...simply to side with someone your own skin color....THAT my friend...is racism at it's finest.

That's part of the reason we need some new blood in there--at least one pair of juevos amid the lot of them, and someone who's willing to do his job, even at the risk of not getting that call back.  We need regular people representing us instead of a parcel of crooks who feel themselves entitled to the positions, and not at all bound to do as their constituency wishes.  Not to mention the graft and collusion and flat out corruption.  Time for revolution!

But in others you are off base. Yes Conservatives do believe in social values and morality, and they don't like change. I ask you is that such a bad thing. A society should have set standards shouldn't it?  Now I am not a religious person, but telling someone what they should believe isn't right either. To me its not a matter weather or not there is a god of some sort, what matters is does that help people become better people as a whole? So in that case its not a matter of right and wrong as much as it is about morality. Now for a history lesson, The Roman Empire fell apart due to the fact that it no longer had a social standard, it attempted to adopt all different aspects of different societies in which caused more confusion and angst more than anything. And because there wasn't any morality left the society crumbled. I believe that is what the Progressives are trying to do. I say if it works don't fix it.

As it currently stands, America is being forced into forming a closer relationship with China as a result of owing them around $600 Billion dollars that was borrowed under the Bush administration in order to finance the war. Its common sense that you don't publicly chastise someone you owe money to, especially if its one of the biggest loans in the history of the world. Not to mention that with the additional interest placed on that borrowed amount, we'll end up paying China back more money than the stimulus bill that was recently signed earlier this week.<br>  <br>  From another viewpoint not from within our own media, some countries probably view our international policies to be in violation of human rights and whatnot to some degree. Considering that the international protests against the Iraq War were the largest in recorded history, and Iraq has been the country with the single largest exodus in recent times (around 2 million Iraqis have fled since 2003). <br>  <br>  I'm sure Clinton's words regarding China came with some hesitancy, as being the Secretary of State she should know more about what China is doing than almost any other US citizen. But in times like these, it seems that forming close bonds with country's we are in heavy debt to is the best course of action from a political standpoint. We owe a lot of money to Japan also (upwards of 600 Billion now) so aside from the recent visit Mrs. Clinton made to Tokyo recently, I would be expecting a lot more US praise of Japan and its people in the times to come.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	It is so much easier to put a bumper sticker on your car that says "free tibet" than it is to actually commit divisions of troops to doing the mission.

The only problem with it was that it was held up in the bureaucracy.  Which is the same thing as saying that they will never see a dime of the money that has been "set aside" for them.<br>  I think that Obama does a lot of speaking out of both sides of his mouth.|`|tDZMJue9aa	obama voted to send money to the bridge to nowhere in alaska rather than to the victims of katrina....this was before the election why would he help them now that he is president..cause he didnt give a **** then and he certainly doesnt give a **** about those  people now|`|AA10535085	New Orleans needs to move Above sea level.|`|L7wJwbjDaa	Why would anyone with any shred of sanity choose to rebuild their home in a city which sits one or two feet below sea level?|`|fBvhkalFaa	How much money do they need to rebuild that rat hole so the occupants can move back and destroy it again?|`|8diTOnNiaa	they are proportioned stimulus taking Katrina into consideration|`|db035173efc210416f7530301531f6f6aa	I have just three words for you - spell checker!|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Left hand - nail.<br>  Right hand - hammer.<br>  Swing - you've hit the nail on the head.<br>  <br>  Bingo!|`|AA10438532	there is a huge difference in running for office and being in office. did you actually think he would keep his promise? before he help new orleans he has to pay back acorn and all the others that cheated so hard to get him elected. i doubt if new orleans contributed enough to his campain for him to worry about now.

Once again just another liberal falsehood.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	I do not see anyone from either side saying Bush is a huge success
U9Cy79anaa	I'll say to conservatives what they said to us for 8 years. Questioning the president's actions or wanting him to fail makes you unpatriotic. So Rush better be careful.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Why are conservative so obsessed that we are?? Obama has said for over a decade that he doesn't support the fairness doctrine. Even Fox News clears this up for you. I couldn't care less what you do with AM radio. I am working during that time and wouldn't listen to it anyway.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Obama opposes the fairness doctrine. This story is old news.|`|sGRZxLfYaa	For all their hot air the far left does not promote nor believe in a marketplace of ideas.  Those of us farther to the right are not afraid of a marketplace of ideas because most often our ideas stand up to scrutiny.  By discussing an idea openly its flaws are exposed or its strength reinforced.  Liberals fear their flawed ideas being exposed.|`|VyRJVPhWaa	because free speech is for free thinkers and it would hinder their attempts at indoctrinating the masses. not only that but libs think that everything should be on an even playing field. just look at this "spread the wealth" idea. they want everyone to be equal in every aspect. if everyone has exactly the same as the next person they should be happy, right?|`|hcc8fq7jaa	They love free speech, as long as they agree with it. Don't you understand?  They only have the newspapers, the networks, AND the cable stations, but you want to deny them the radio? How unfair. My God!<br>  They're opposed to any medium where the opposition can be heard. They'll go after the internet next. Mark my words.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	Wow.  You missed a memo.  Although this became a frenzied issue on the Right... most on the Left have no interest.  AND the president has already said he would not support a "fairness doctrine".|`|Yu6WrjjNaa	They just want to shut down Talk Radio which is about the only source of conservative point's of view.  What they do not realize is that if that happens, then ALL the liberal Media outlet's, TV, Newspapers, Magazines would have to changed to include equal time for each view.|`|FOf9Y9dqaa	Why do you address this as a liberal concern?

Your question is irrelevant...|`|23199b21cfd8fa260dd90623c1817eeeaa	The decision is ultimately left up to the state congress, rather then the governor. The congress is also elected, I don't see any problems.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You do realize that the state congress can also reject the funds if they are in agreement with there states governor.|`|eulMjLtPaa	This only applies to governors.  A governor has 45 days to certify that the state will request and use the dollars provided in the law. State lawmakers can accept the federal money even if their governor objects, if the state House and Senate adopt a resolution supporting receipt of the dollars.  <br>  <br>  So obviously, it will be the will of the legislatures, who actually represent the people of the state, rather than a petulant governor.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	No.<br>  <br>  Is this rant more whining?

But on the plus side, when we *do* hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up =]|`|MTkXXOsjaa	Well, only the future can say how bad things will get but there IS this thing called the "Roman Empire Effect."  What was the downfall of every single major civilization in the past?  Money.  What's causing all of our troubles today?  Money.  Hmm...|`|x1rQ6XPOaa	Don't worry about the economy, just start growing your own vegetables and making your own clothes, and walla you are TRULY FREE!<br>  <br>  Or just rely on welfare and cut back a lot and you are FREE!<br>  <br>  Seriously, recession doesn't affect these people that cut back and save their earnings. These people do not require much maintenance to start. Some examples include the Big Mac eating Bill Gates.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	He should know he started it all...<br>  That Anti American Traitor...SOB...|`|so3UneMXaa	I believe that the democrats are setting up a grim outlook for us all, so that when the recessions does curve back up, (and it always has so far in my lifetime). Then Obama (a democrat) will get all the credit for saving the country. It's all politics! I would stop paying attention to the news for awhile if I were you. Relax, it will all be good.|`|FOf9Y9dqaa	Technically, no one knows or there would not be so many different opinions about it.  There are a lot of smart people working on this, and if none of them can agree, then that cannot be a good sign.  All we can do is hope and pray.|`|fzANVpWqaa	George Soros is a socialist who stands to gain as our economy sinks, he doesn't know if it'll get worse, he can only hope, it benefits him if it does.

ipKhrj7Waa	love people that answer questions, especially military wives!!!!!  How they know everything.......<br>  <br>  this is the deal, RIP is a 3 week course (kinda like basic training on steroids) that if you pass you will get assigned to a Ranger Battalion.  From there, if you prove yourself, your Sqd Ldr may send you to Rgr School. <br>  <br>  Ranger School - EVERYBODY TAKE NOTICE - completely unaffiliated with RIP or ROP or what goes on in a Ranger Battalion.  <br>  <br>  It is a 68 day course (plus more if you do the extend tour) that teaches the basics of patrolling and other infantry skills in beautiful environments of the southeast USA.  It will make you smile, cry and piss you off, but if you get to sew that tab on, it is completely worth it and will be the best day of your life, hands down.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, no RIP is no where near as hard as Ranger School - it has nothing to do with it.  But yes it is challenging in its own right.   Alot of recruiters commonly lump them all together and fill your head with wild stories, (mine did) in reality, they don't have a clue, it just sound tough and cool.  Oh, if you get to mountains, stay out of Wal-mart!!|`|014NXPfFaa	RIP is harder than Ranger school and ROP is hardest.|`|13k2WKx8aa	RIP? Like the Marine Recon deal? You better believe it is!<br>  <br>  As hard as though? I'd say its tougher. How much do the rangers have to swim?<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh. Army RIP. DAMN YOU INTERCHANGEABLE ACRONYMS!!!|`|wrLu93C9aa	keep on dreaming............
oKU7tFWyaa	In all honesty... The rancher should sue the Federal government for emotional distress, and his expenses.  He's doing their job, and at his own expense.<br>  <br>  Vigilante actions is what Charles Bronson does in all his Death Wish movies.  The rancher didn't kill anyone.  Mexico is still pushing for humane treatment of their nationals in the U.S.  When Mexico can demonstrate that they themselves can give their nationals, and illegals humane treatment within their own borders.... Then my opinion might change.  But then again... The U.S. already delivers humane treatment to the illegals within our borders, including the Mexican nationals.  Mexico just won't be happy until we take them all in.|`|aMkLPOOeaa	he spoke the truth|`|OlrMm5WLaa	It is not, his propery, he is renting, and this persons where walking in a road, that is public, that cross,this state land, As I know, in America exist the free transit, in public roads,,,,This guy doesn't, own or rent the roads........So  he is a criminal breaking the law, ,, This great country have justice for all,,,,,,don't You think?|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I would be so PO'd by that ruling.

If the government WAS doing its job, he wouldnt have had to take this in the rear!|`|XFZmAMOAaa	He needs help on that border.Kinda like I break into your house and you hurt me trying to detain me and I sue you for assault and get the money.Maybe we should go to mexico and clean out the government and cops.|`|AA10438532	that ruling was crap. all of the illegals should have to do jail time and then be deported not given a judgement.

7uznrLBXaa	It's a house of justice, so dress respectfully.  <br>  <br>  Men: You need not wear a suit and tie.  Even clean jeans are fine if you wear a button-down shirt and tie with it.  Generally, dress pants or khakis with a dress shirt and tie are fine.  Dress as you would for a religious service, dinner at your girlfriend's/boyfriend's parents' house, etc.<br>  <br>  Women: Dress pants and a plain, modest shirt are fine.  Modest means your shoulders are covered, you are not showing any cleavage, and the top is not skin-tight.  If you wear a skirt, have it hit the knees.  No high-cut slits or tight skirts.  No heels above 3 inches, max.  No heavy make-up or jewelry.  Keep your hair neat and out of your face.  Dress as you would for a religious service, dinner at your girlfriend's/boyfriend's parents' house, etc.<br>  <br>  I do not recommend you dress like the majority of people who show up for juvenile court - tank tops, hoodies, baggy pants, flashy jewelry, etc.|`|8dc5NMexaa	Judges are disciplined to follow judicial ethics and temperament; however I have seen a few inappropriately "lose their good temper" on bad days for them (who knows what was going on in their private lives that day) and take some aggression out on innocent parties who appeared in front of them as if they were not thinking that the court, the judge, the proceedings were not worthy of respect.  Let not your attire wear you.  You wear your attire.  Let not your clothes be an object to which would bring attention, either positive or negative.  A cowboy should not wear a business suit for it is not comfortable to his being.  An old man should not wear slippers because they are comfortable.  Wear slacks or jeans, dockers and tennies, fairly nice shirt, nothing "cool," just usual.  Do not wear shades, flip-flops, heavy make-up, chains, overly-baggy clothes, shorts, or the like.  Most courts will judge without regard to dress, but don't take a chance that you may add to your stress by the chance appearance before a court that may be having a bad day or an unusual judge that takes in appearances as part of his/her judgment considerations.|`|uegmmnOpaa	When you go to court all the judge knows about you is what is on the paperwork in front of him.  Your appearance is the first thing people see, and even the most objective people make snap decisions based on how you look, sometimes without even realizing it.  For example if you see a person wearing sweat pants, flip flops, and a shirt with holes you would view them differently then if they were wearing a business suit with a tie.  This is your chance to sell your image.  Dress respectably.  This is not the day to wear a t-shirt that shows your belly button, or a wife beater that displays all 500 of your tattoos.  Go for modest.  If you wouldn't wear it to church don't wear it to court.  make sure your over all appearance is neat.  Stand up straight, speak clearly, and make good eye contact.  You want to convince they judge that you are a good person who made a mistake, not a delinquent headed for a life of crime.  Especially being young the judge is more likely to give you a second chance.  I hope it goes well for you.  Good luck!|`|pGSfFI6aaa	When I went I just wore the clothes I wear everyday, but if you're really worried about it wear something nicer, more conservative|`|ScZPVCUpaa	I've seen people show up in tank tops, shorts, flip flops, it's amazing.<br>  Anyway, you will make a good impression if you wear something simple, like pants and a blouse, or a dress, no midriff showing, nothing too trendy.  Hope it turns out ok for you.|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	don't wear anything with writing on it like a t-shirt with a funny saying. also, don't wear denim or athletic shoes.

Was there a light bar on top?<br>  <br>  5.) Did the deputy appear to be in his police uniform?<br>  <br>  6.) I would call the Sheriff’s office immediately & report this.

Our country will invariably get much worse as time progresses, we owe over 3 trillion dollars to other countries as it stands, and that's only a third of it. However, when times were getting progressively worse economically under the Bush administration (this didn't all happen over night) they were hardly criticizing the President or his administration then.<br>  <br>  I think it doesn't take much courage to say that the state of the nation if F'd-up currently, regardless of what your political ideologies or preferences are. Let alone if you're getting paid millions of dollars for saying that (as Bill O' Reilly, Glen Beck, Keith Olbermann, and Rush Limbaugh are to name a few) your nothing more than a spineless media person anyway. If our economy does begin to collapse (which I don't expect, but you never know) I guarantee you that all those bastards in the media who call themselves patriots will be the first ones to take a plane ride out, or transfer all their funds into a Swiss bank account. <br>  <br>  Now is not the time to be listening to any politically-bias media station if you have any hope of understanding the current predicament facing the nation, or if you want to help yourself and the country (as people seemed to want to do following 9/11). It seems like most people are only playing out to the very whims of a media that only encourages social disunion when we should all be united for the common cause of doing our part to fix the country. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't question the government, but for things out of your power you should do what you can to help the same country as it was seven years ago.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	I don't know whether he is right or wrong.

It is a way of life and as you deal with your needs, you find freedom to help others.<br>  <br>  Because you have dealt with your needs, you are qualified to help others with similar need. Not with a handout, but by sharing your courage and you knowledge. <br>  <br>  Because you have dealt with your needs you are free from fear, you can trust yourself to have the right answers to lifes problems. <br>  <br>  You don't get arrested for stealing, you get paid for working.<br>  You arent hungry for food, but for tomorrow to show up so you can face life again.<br>  <br>  It's a way of living, not some tool to win a hypocrisy contest.|`|AA11995584	Conservatism deals with what causes peoples needs. Liberalism deals with peoples circumstance without addressing their need. Liberalism will always fail because it requires people with needs to promote its agenda.

Fanatics are those people who become so engrossed in a particular thing that their lives become one with the cause. This happens in many areas of life, not just in terrorism. Sports has their share of fanatics. You can see this by the fist fights that often break out at games of all kinds. Religions certainly have their share of fanatics and can sometimes do more harm than good because of it. Gang bangers sometimes have a fanaticism about their particular gang. And obviously politics have their fanatics as well. The fanaticism of the terrorist I think is two fold. A literal translation of specific parts of what they consider to be their holy book or leader along with a deeply felt sense of being the victim. And if you are talking about Muslim terrorists in particular, they also believe that they will benefit themselves by dying.  Americans can be terrorists too as we all know. It comes from that same sense of being victimized or thinking that the nation is being victimized etc. No matter how you look at it, terrorism is the result of people losing a true sense of reality over perception..|`|13fDE4nGaa	I can sum it up in 3 words..

Once the economic downturn is over, China will find new customers in the developing global market, but we won't find new countries to lend us money. Right now. we have to spend money in order to stimulate what's going on in America, ( Pres. Hover cut back spending and the country went into a tailspin) but the only hope for the borrowing to end is to develop the alternative energy industry and sell its applications throughout the world, while also creating employment for people here in the USA. How much do we piss away on foreign oil? That's my humble opinion.

People that got loans they knew they couldnt pay for made the mistake not the other way around. I could have 250k in credit cards if I wanted to, but that would be me spending money I didnt have. I choose to only spend what i actually have. The people who choose to rack up credit card debt make the choice to get themselves in trouble and should have to get themselves out of it. the same thing goes for these house buyers. <br>  <br>  Becuase of my finacial discipline I own my home outright and dont have to worry about forclosure. I lived in a rented house that was much less rent than what i could afford so i could save up for a house of my own. I did without new cars, plasma TV's and bought with the money I had. After I bought my house i had no other debt so I made double payments on my house and paid it off really early.

I just pray we survive this next 4 years.<br>  <br>  Its going to take someone as bad as Obama to wake up america to the reality of the destruction of the democratic party, which is why their so few and far inbetween elections, revive conservitisim, and i mean conservitism, not Neo Republicanism.<br>  <br>  It took Carter to get Reagan.|`|UGk26Cxraa	There would be even BIGGER worries (yeah, I know it doesn't seem possible). You see, the reps. and the whole rest of Congress would be far more worried about ol' McCain kicking the bucket, and letting the Soccer Mom (whose name shall not be mentioned) become president.|`|BsQcplTQaa	There wouldn't be a mess, we would have fixed it in 2006. You know when the Democrats took over congress.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	We will see about it next election. This Congress is out.|`|XuLVfj1caa	I often wonder that same thing.  They would definitely be doing it differently.  First, as McCain said, the stim would be half of what it is now and it would be almost entirely made up of tax cuts.  I really get why they want tax cuts but now?  Capital Gains tax cuts now?  Who's making any capital gains?  Anyway, I rant.  They would also shut down almost all social programs.  I say this not to disparage republicans but they really believe that people should be on their own.  So no education grants, no extended unemployment benefits (or at least less), less welfare, definitely no healthcare for kids bill.  All these things are programs that cost money.  So, if you're going to reduce taxes (and revenue for the government) you have to stop spending programs.  <br>  <br>  They would also likely increase military and defense spending.  Create a few new fighter planes or tanks, buy a few battle ships, and weapons systems.  These things have to be built in America and those projects do create jobs in various sectors.  <br>  <br>  No auto bailouts, definitely no  homeowner bailouts.  The banks, get bailed out but only because they donate lots of campaign funds.  Then, they wait.  They wait until all those wealthy people who got the tax cuts start hiring more people and spending more money so that it can trickle down to the middle class.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Republicans (assuming that they were conservative republicans) would have cut corporate taxes.  This would allow the companies in trouble to use the tax money to shore up weak areas.  The companies that did not have poor leadership would be able to invest the money creating jobs and increasing their market share.  This would reward the good CEOs and encourage proper behavior in the future.|`|9npIzlHKaa	No - they would be exacerbating the problem:<br>  - More tax cuts for corporations and the rich.<br>  - Even Less oversight.<br>  - Even More de-regulations.<br>  - Even more govn't contracts to corporate CEO's.<br>  - Even more wars in the middle east<br>  <br>  America would finally be destroyed.<br>  <br>  etc.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Its not Bush's mess anymore its Obama's mess!

The question is what has Obama done different.<br>  <br>  What people refuse to see is he brought no change, just more of the same.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Yep, it would be more tax cuts for the rich and the corporations to stimulate the rich and the corporations.|`|Dqk3uuwzaa	1.    Payroll Tax Stimulus. With a temporary new tax credit to offset 50% of the payroll tax, every small business would have more money, and all Americans would take home more of what they earn.<br>  2.    Real Middle-Income Tax Relief. Reduce the marginal tax rate of 25% down to 15%, in effect establishing a flat-rate tax of 15% for close to 9 out of 10 American workers.<br>  3.    Reduce the Business Tax Rate. Match Ireland’s rate of 12.5% to keep more jobs in America.<br>  4.    Homeowner’s Assistance. Provide tax credit incentives to responsible home buyers so they can keep their homes.<br>  5.    Control Spending So We Can Move to a Balanced Budget. This begins with eliminating congressional earmarks and wasteful pork-barrel spending.<br>  6.    No State Aid Without Protection From Fraud. Require state governments to adopt anti-fraud and anti-theft policies before giving them more money. <br>  7.    More American Energy Now. Explore for more American oil and gas and invest in affordable energy for the future, including clean coal, ethanol, nuclear power and renewable fuels.<br>  8.    Abolish Taxes on Capital Gains. Match China, Singapore and many other competitors. More investment in America means more jobs in America. <br>  9.    Protect the Rights of American Workers. We must protect a worker’s right to decide by secret ballot whether to join a union, and the worker’s right to freely negotiate. Forced unionism will kill jobs in America at a time when we can’t afford to lose them.<br>  10.    Replace Sarbanes-Oxley. This failed law is crippling entrepreneurial startups. Replace it with affordable rules that help create jobs, not destroy them.<br>  11.    Abolish the Death Tax. Americans should work for their families, not for Washington.<br>  12.    Invest in Energy and Transportation Infrastructure. This includes a new, expanded electric power grid and a 21st Century air traffic control system that will reduce delays in air travel and save passengers, employees and airlines billions of dollars per year.

You make it sound as if he were planning to invest the whole social security fund (which hasn't existed since the 60's) into marginal schemes.<br>  Had you paid any attention, instead of only condemning any and all ideas originating from him, you would have realized that he wanted to allow younger workers to have the right to invest a whopping 2% of what would normally have been taken by Social Security, into stock funds of their own choosing. <br>  You blithely call this a craps shoot, yet can't see all the wasteful spending perpetrated by your beloved liberal leaders.<br>  When did you libs allow your leaders to pervert Kennedy's "Ask not what your country can do for you, aks what you can do for your country" into "What can my country do for me today that I'm either too lazy or stupid to do for myself"?|`|WXCa8zQoaa	your a creative little sucker ill give you that hahaha that would have to be very interesting wouldn't it|`|MVY8xhXlaa	blaming Bush after the fact for trying to give us freedom of choice- good thinking<br>  <br>  (wow, where do these people come from???????)|`|trMsK86jaa	Lol, then blackwater would've been able to take over.<br>  <br>  ^^|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	Well yes I do...For starters, we would have all the wasted SS money back, and two the volume of the DOW would be around 50,000 instead of 7000.<br>  <br>  This will be hard for you but I want you to think...our money is going there now.

But, would you really expect these execs to give up their multi-million dollar bonuses for incompetence funded by the US Tax Payer?

I'm amazed at how he's cutting pay wages (not his own), saying it will help the economy, but if cut the consumers pay, they spend less.    Giving 800 billion to the AMERICAN CONSUMER is a good idea.    But he's only wasting 800 billion that only goes unadvised and into unproductive and useless corperations.    If corperations are failing, its not more money they need. Its changing how they work. This is how we got into from a recession to a depression in 1933. They put us in more debt my creating more money out of thin air.     700 billion to now I hear a 900 billion pacakge. Thats 1.6 trillion in tax payer dollars. Lets hope they don't pass it because that will only in the long run put you in worse condition.     As Ron Paul said when a man claimed that the economy was going great in 2007 and that his economic collaspe was BS.

On that basis it is likely he will be losing his licence upon conviction.    It perhaps sounds more severe that the distance driven was only small, but essentially the distance driven is irrelevant, it is the simple fact that the car is being driven by a driver over the limit.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	I don't know that there's any difference in the Scots law and the English law on this one.

They falsely claimed it was an emergency bill to cut off all debate.<br>  The lie about the urgency was made clear when President Obama, rather than immediately signing the bill, went on vacation to celebrate Valentine’s Day with his wife in Chicago. [Amazingly he had been in Washington less than a month before he took his first vacation!]<br>  In fact, Obama took almost four days to sign this “urgent” bill.<br>  <br>  Big Lie No. 2: Immediate Stimulus<br>  And then there is Big Lie No. 2: The bill offered immediate help to our ailing economy.<br>  The truth: The bill does not offer significant, immediate stimulus.<br>  Most of the stimulus money won’t even be spent this year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office!<br>  And the CBO has warned that the bill actually will hurt long-term economic growth.<br>  Infrastructure programs, including items such as $8 billion for a high-speed train between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, will take a decade or longer to complete – if environmentalists ever let the project begin.<br>  Republican traitor Arlen Specter, who backed the stimulus bill, got more than $6 billion in the bill for “medical research” – another lulu that has nothing to do with immediate economic stimulus.<br>  Big Lie No. 3: Bipartisan Support<br>  <br>  Then there is Big Lie No. 3: This bill was a bipartisan effort to save the economy.<br>  It was anything but.<br>  Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham said bluntly: “If this is going to be bipartisanship, the country's screwed."<br>  Indeed, every Republican in the House voted against the bill, along with six courageous Democratic congressmen.<br>  In the Senate, almost every Republican opposed the bill except three liberals: Sens. Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Arlen Specter.<br>  Obama promised he would change the “old politics” of Washington. Instead, he is playing hardball partisan Democratic politics of the Chicago type.<br>  He has used the weakening economy as his Reichstag fire event to get to pass an incredible amount of money so he could funnel huge amounts of pork and political payoffs to his Democratic cronies and allies.<br>  And now, he is even talking about a second stimulus program! Why not? Congress just passed his first bill without even reading it! What a joke . . .<br>  Help us expose Obama’s Big Lies<br>  The Real Purpose: Abolish the GOP<br>  <br>  I have no doubt what the real purpose of the stimulus bill was.<br>  Simply, it was to lay the ground work of the remaking of America’s political system into a one-party system.<br>  <br>  Yes, a one-party socialist state that destroyed countries like Mexico.<br>  We have seen what one-party rule has done to cities like Cleveland, Detroit, other cities – and corrupt Chicago.<br>  The media will never tell you this, but that’s the real agenda behind the Obama stimulus bill.<br>  This is why so little of the stimulus is spent now, but spread out over several years.<br>  <br>  This means Obama and Democrats will have hundreds of billions to disburse to their supporters, creating a new party cadre that will help them win re-election in 2010 and 2012.<br>  Don’t believe me?<br>  Well, we all know the fraud perpetrated by groups like ACORN to register Democratic voters.<br>  <br>  In the run-up to the 2009 election, millions of new “voters” were registered – and it clearly helped elect Obama – and gave the Democrats big majorities in the House and Senate.<br>  Their game plan for 2008 worked. Now they want to use public funds – our tax dollars – to pay for more of their political activities.<br>  For example, the final stimulus bill gives $3 billion to groups like ACORN.<br>  <br>  Consider that, in 2008, Obama claimed that he raised $750 million for his campaign. Compared with that amount, ACORN’s $3 billion is staggering.<br>  <br>  No doubt, these billions will help ACORN in its political work of “community organizing” – a euphemism for Democratic activitism.<br>  <br>  But it’s not just ACORN who is getting “stimulus.”<br>  The bulk of the Obama stimulus goes directly to the powerful government employee unions that helped get Obama elected and are the backbone, the shock troops, of the Democratic Party.<br>  <br>  Amazingly, it’s been estimated that half of the stimulus appropriation directly benefits government employee and service employees union that played key roles in Obama’s election.<br>  Second, the bill gives tens of billions to state and local governments to dole out to their cronies. This means there will be even less accountability by Congress.<br>  <br>  And then there are massive payoffs to the special interests to the Democratic Party, with giveaways such as $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, $300 million for new cars for government bureaucrats, $1.2 billion for “youth activities,” tens of billions for “green, environmental and energy programs” — they even include $3.7 billion to help “green” military bases and another $125 million to restore “a bandoned mines.”<br>  Shockingly, the bill creates 33 new government programs!<br>  The stimulus money will give the Democrats the opportunity to become the dominant political party for the next generation.<br>  Counter the Democratic machine by helping us today – Go Here Now<br>  Our Plan to Stop Obama<br>  Despite the massive political payouts Obama, Reid and Pelosi are funneling to their allies across the country, they can still be stopped.<br>  The polls show Americans want a two-party system. They don’t want corrupt, Chicago-style politics in Washington.<br>  They don’t want their taxpayer funds used for political shenanigans and payoffs.<br>  We at the National Republican Trust PAC want to expose the incredible rip-off the stimulus bill will be to the taxpayers.<br>  If Americans knew that the bill would place an additional $9,400 in debt upon each household in America, they would be appalled.<br>  If Americans knew the extent to which this bill is going for political payoffs to groups like ACORN, they would be outraged.<br>  We know that Americans will wake up to what Congress has perpetrated on them with this stimulus.<br>  But we also know we can’t rely on the media to tell the facts.<br>  This is why we want to keep up our media efforts to expose Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.<br>  We now know they have a radical plan for the nation.<br>  There are already calls among Democrats for a new Fairness Doctrine to close down talk radio and hosts like Rush, Hannity, Boortz, Beck, Savage and others.<br>  The Democrats are already talking about legalizing 12 million illegals, making them citizens and voters overnight.<br>  <br>  The Democrats know that, if they do this, they will instantly change the political landscape in the nation for a generation or More.<br>  <br>  This is why the Republican National Trust has launched a media campaign in exposing Sen. Specter in Pennsylvania and Sens. Snowe and Collins in Maine. We want their constituents to know exactly how their senators voted against the public’s best interests.<br>  <br>  The national republican trust has targeted Democratic senators like Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas because we know that Obama is passing sweeping legislation, and that we need to put these senators and congressmen on notice: If they vote for Obama’s plan, they will pay a heave price back home among their voters. <br>  <br>  The National Republican Trust PAC have already played a critical role. We were a key factor in Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ landslide victory in the special Senate run-off in Georgia.<br>  <br>  CNN has called us one of the most “powerful” political action committees in the nation.<br>  Dick Morris, the Fox News analyst, has called the National Republican Trust the most important political force in the nation. He says they are now doing the work of the Republican Party.<br>  <br>  But success depends on the people.<br>  We don’t have fat-cat donors and corporate sponsors.<br>  We depend on Americans who care about this country and who want us to keep fighting.<br>  <br>  Prepare for the coming major battles ahead with Obama, Pelosi and Reid.|`|9bb789fb1a182ebae292a0ef4f9b205eaa	because he had the final say. he didnt even read what was in the bill and he used fear to get people behind it.
vPZ2ERjzaa	Wow, is that guy way off. Long-arm statutes are civil law, not criminal law. Long story short and somewhat simplified:<br>  First, they are a form of law where a state declares when it has personal jurisdiction over someone who is being sued. Not every state has a long-arm statute.<br>  Second, Supreme Court decisions say that the only limit on when a state can constitutionally have personal jurisdiction over someone is when granting personal jurisdiction in a situation would violate the Constitution's Due Process clauses.<br>  Third, a "long-arm" statute is a state's law defining personal jurisdiction where that law (either explicitly or through court interpretations) allows personal jurisdiction all the way up to the constitutional limits; that way, there are no "cracks" where a state could constitutionally have personal jurisdiction, but because the state's statute isn't worded broadly enough so the state doesn't have jurisdiction under its own state law. <br>  <br>  The finer points of long-arm statutes would be examined in a question like this (although this is a simplified fact pattern and explanation):<br>  Paul is driving through the state of X; he is in the middle of moving from State Y to State Z, where he has not yet arrived. Dave, who lives in State Z, negligently crashes into Paul in State X. Where all can Paul sue Dave?<br>  <br>  Imagine State Y's law said it has jurisdiction over Dave, but the Due Process says that would be unconstitutional: Y has no personal jurisdiction, and Paul can't sue Dave here.<br>  Imagine State X's law said it has jurisdiction over Dave, and this wouldn't violate Due Process: X has jurisdiction, and Paul can sue Dave here.<br>  Imagine State Q (the state where Paul had just bought the car he was driving) has a law saying that it doesn't have jurisdiction over Dave, even though for some quirk in the law Due Process would not be violated by having jurisdiction over Dave in this case: State Q lacks jurisdiction over Dave because it does not have a long-arm statute. If it had a long-arm statute, that statute would grant personal jurisdiction in any situation where Due Process wouldn't be violated.|`|z88IMXNFaa	It gives courts personal jurisdiction over persons and companies with minimum contacts in a particular state.|`|20axdeO2aa	So that criminals cannot get away with crimes by moving to a different state.

Check your rental agreement.   Even if you don't have an agreement (like living in a friends basement), once you PAY rent, you are automatically covered under Fair Housing laws.    HOW you are treated is HIGHLY REGULATED and your landlord is PROBABLY violating the law (even if he doesn't realize it).|`|vGu6bcR9aa	You have no choice.    All they are required to do is give you written 24 hour notice before entry.    They don't need your permission.|`|f204f9a2a08b07906da7fcc16e34e34daa	I remember when I was renting, the landlord had a specific paragraph in the lease stating they can enter the premises with reasonable notice.  I think it's pretty common, and legal, for rental properties to be shown while someone still lives there, just as houses are shown while they are still inhabited.  They gave you a day's notice, so that will probably suffice, legally.  Sure, it's an inconvenience, especially when you don't work what society feels is a "normal" schedule, but they don't care about that.  Their main concern is getting a renter to replace you so their income isn't affected.  Good luck.

I'm either doing infantry or MP...a lot of police departments both are great, but I was also told that infantry is a bit better for tatical knowledge, better with me getting use to spilt second deiscion making, i'll be able to abapt to different atoomsphere's quicker, i'll have better judgement skills, I'll stay in phsyical condition ect.. And dont let NO ONE discourge you from your choice with enlisting in any branch of the military. I've had that happen to me sooooooooo many times now, if I had a nickel for everytime someone tried to talk me out of joining, I wouldnt even have to join, because I would be so rich....so just go for it!

When information about the enemy is needed, they call on the Scouts. They are responsible for reconnaissance and you will learn about various weapons to include explosives and mines. Cavalry Scouts engage the enemy with antiarmor weapons and scout vehicles in the field, track and report enemy movement and activities, and will direct the employment of various weapon systems onto the enemy. Here are a few of the duties of a Cavalry Scout: * Secure and prepare ammunition on scout vehicles * Load, clear and fire individual and crewserved weapons * Perform navigation during combat * Serve as member of observation and listening posts * Gather and report information on terrain, weather and enemy disposition and equipment.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	The Army Reserves do not have combat arms formations.  If you want to be a Cav Scout in an actual Cavalry Squadron you are going to have to join the National Guard.  Same thing goes for Infantry, Artillery, Armor, and Combat Engineers.|`|IKw5lXQbaa	yeah youll have time unless you go overseas.youll meet for drill one weekend a month. yes, you can be cav in the reserves,but regular army would probably be more fun|`|AOaHaRvBaa	Yes, you will have time to attend college while you are in the Army Reserves. You will train only one weekend a month plus two weeks of annual training (AT) a year.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you will have to be on active duty for your initial training, professional development schools, and deployments (either stateside, overseas, or both).  Most schools and individual professors will work with you around your weekend training, ATs, and deployments.<br>  <br>  There are no combat arms units (Infantry, Armor, Calvary, etc.)  in the Army Reserves, so I doubt if there are any slots for 19Ds. There are combat arms units in the National Guard, however.  Additionally, you may get more funding for college in the National Guard than in the Army Reserves.

First, after business finally embraced and learned how to implement the computer technologies, it was the most dramatic increase in worker efficiency per man hour worked than any period of time before or since. Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates artificially low instead of letting the open market determine the natural rate. This fueled all kinds of speculative spending (hence the dot com bust), poor investments and poor lending habits (hence the current housing bust) due to money being cheap to borrow. So, who ever wishes to take credit for the 'economic boom of the 90's also takes blame for the current economic melt down. In my book both parties are to blame.<br>  The  bill for the abnormal growth in the nineties due to improper government intervention at coincidentally the same time as major technological implementation has now come due.

0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	You have it backwards my friend. It is because the people have in large part become twisted, demented and corrupt that we have the kind of government that we have now. Our country is full of people who honestly and truly expect the government to take care of them and they see nothing wrong with that. They make excuses for their own failings and blame others for everything that has gone wrong in their lives. They want everything handed to them like a spoiled child. And the government has become the spoiling parent in response to it.<br>  <br>  Our country will not survive if the people refuse to grow up and accept the responsibility for themselves. The Constitution does not proclaim our right to have happiness....but to pursue it. That means we have to do the work. We have to accept our role in either winning or losing. We will only sink further into the pit of entitlements if we don't start making some real changes in our lives.<br>  <br>  For those of us who have always taken responsibility, this is indeed a bitter pill to swallow. We see our life savings destroyed. We see our children and our children's children saddled with enormous debt. We watch as mother/father government allows people to become even weaker and less responsible for themselves. It is up to us now....to make the change that needs to be made. I am not a Republican but am an Independent who leans toward fiscal conservatism and I am going to do everything in my power to swing the pendulum back to center so that responsible people have a vote. I don't hate our President. I know he is only doing what he thinks he needs to do...but in this case, he is being given bad advice. His comparative youth and inexperience is showing itself. We need to rid the country of legislators that give him this bad advice. In your own district or state, find someone who speaks with a voice of responsibility and reason to run against those who will be coming up for re-election in 2010. If we don't start doing it now, it will be to late.It doesn't matter which party they belong to....although it would be better if they didn't have any party affiliation...but either way, judge them on their sense of purpose and responsibility.|`|UGk26Cxraa	I concur.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	Vote in others and Obama isn't the only problem.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	There is no inherent contradiction in being pro-choice and anti-capital punishment, OR vice-versa. The abortion issue generally comes down to where you believe that life begins. Pro-lifers think life begins at conception (and therefore, logically, abortion is murder), whereas pro-choicers believe life begins at birth. Both sides will dazzle you with scientific studies and convincing evidence to support their case, but there simply is no way to “prove” either side - it boils down to what you BELIEVE.<br>  <br>  The death penalty is a completely unrelated issue.  I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  [To those who say that the death penalty kills only those who “deserve it” – please read the above paragraph again.]<br>  <br>  2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Left hand - nail.<br>  Right hand - hammer.<br>  Swing - you've hit the nail on the head.<br>  <br>  Bingo!|`|nXxtBkguaa	the reasoning is that the baby is not actually "human" yet.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	Abortion doesn't kill anyone.

GMHERSExaa	Lets get it straight its not just primarily immigrants, it is Illegal Aliens you are talking about. I say grab them and give them the boot. We can all see how they destroyed California. Who else wants to be next.|`|8XqD6xSCaa	agreed <br>  <br>  many immigrants see Australia as hitting the "jackpot" now were sitten here waving more of our tax dollers away to people who don't deserve it. especially when most cant even be bothered learning our language or care about our country. send them back i say. <br>  <br>  i believe the government just allow them to reside in our country so they can create allies for the possibility of a future war break out.|`|PMWfbgUZaa	The native americans were here first then we immagrated...now imagine if we had cut off immagratioin in the 1900's that would be a mess half of us wouldnt be here...now if we cut off immigration now it will be as if we cut it off in the 1900's<br>  <br>  lol i have no clue wat im talking about...i really dont care..i just wish they would learn english when they came here so at least we could understand them lol|`|HzVE4kz1aa	look, my family has been in this country for 200 years, but they were still immigrants.  What is so threatening about immigrants?  how do you even tell the difference?  20% of this country speaks a language other than English at home.  Which of those families have been here 1 generation?  2?  who cares?  leave them alone.  We have plenty of money, we just screwed ourselves over by not policing our own financial markets.  don't blame poor people.  the rich did this.  send them to jail, and take all their ill gotten money and put it back in our bloodless veins.|`|phuiDk0Baa	I'm not sure what your question is since you've went a little bit off topic from the main question<br>  <br>  The major reason why people are migrating to different countries is because in their country there is diseases, poverty, no opportunity, laws are too loose, corruption, the list goes on. Most of this happens in poorer countries. So when a poorer country is next to one that has much more resources then they do (not meaning enough for everyone, but its big shown in charts and compared to smaller countries) they want to go and seek an equal or close to equal opprotunity as the citizens whom live there. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is research the countries that are around the United States, read their news about the United States, and compare it to the news that you read here about them. Huge difference. <br>  <br>  True, USA is going to some tough times now, but its from circumstances in result of the countries actions and decisions. You can't compare that to the other countries, whom have been enslaved, went through countless revolutions, corrupted leaders, and who are still stuck in the "3rd world era"<br>  <br>  Hopefully the current President now can help improve the conditions in which the United States is in now, and once that's done, "help out" the poorer countries so there will be less and less people migrating into the United States. But before that can happen, United States, and its people, must work together to improve themselves.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	In case you didn't notice, Many illegals are now leaving the country.

I'm guessing your relatives got here before 1920?  They had to pay taxes, but they weren't as high as they became in the 1900's.  And most immigrants don't receive any benefits - you need a social security number and legal permanent resident status to receive anything.  But their employers are supposed to pay their taxes and they are too, even if they're just J-1 student visas.  We're running out of money for welfare and social security because our government miscalculated and then borrowed against and used all that money too quickly.  And there's fraud and theft of the system by American citizens whose grandparents came to this country with nothing but the clothes on their back, etc, etc.|`|AkIgv5WVaa	I saw a saying I just love. It says, "Ask the Indians why it's important to control immigration".

Like you said it is only to monthes and everything will be okay... I will pray for you :) everything will be good :)
AA10829482	Bless your heart there's no time to get them taken out in basic. . . every minute of your day is planned.  If they give you problems later, you can have them taken out and they give you some very nice drugs.|`|014NXPfFaa	No. You can keep them.  And if you need them removed then they dont do it like how you described... they can put you to sleep.|`|LWzrCu5caa	No.  They only remove them if they are causing you problems.  Some people keep them their entire life without problems.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	If it is deemed that they are or will become a problem (not enough room for them to properly erupt etc) they will be pulled... If they are deemed to not be a potential problem you can opt out of having them pulled... <br>  <br>  Getting wisdom teeth pulled isn't too bad...  I had 2 sets (I know weird one set partially erupted impacted and was pulled, then a second set erupted about 14 months later... Had them pulled as well due to lack of room)..<br>  <br>  I didn't feel a thing during the actual extraction of the first 6 (They can either use a local or put you out... I chose local)... Had the final 2 extracted with no pain blocker (I was several months pregnant and chose not to use pain blocker) ..  With the first 6 I took Tylenol with codeine for a day then regular Tylenol for a few days..  With the last 2 I didn't take any pain meds..   <br>  <br>  It wasn't too bad I was back on my feet and back to my normal routine (Excluding eating pointy or poky foods) within 3 days..  No problem...<br>  <br>  Man up and get it done if needed the pain of an impacted tooth is far worse than the pain of extraction...|`|PzSI7EPEaa	It's not painful and you dont need to be put to sleep. I was wide awake they just numbed the area and the Surgeon just went at the teeth with a hammer and chisel.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Optional. Mine grew in like normal teeth so no removal. Friends coming sideways (which causes big problems later) they recommended removal and it was done.|`|zJncQoqsaa	When you join the military you are becoming "their" investment.  They are going to make sure that you are worth it.  And they don't want any preventative problems that would make you incapable of doing your duty in the worst kind of scenario.  Did you know you can get into trouble if you even get a sunburn?  Getting your wisdom teeth pulled was mandatory when I was in.  They are the teeth that will cause a person the most problems even if taken care of properly.  It is in the military best interest to remove the problem before it starts.   They are not needed any more than your appendix or tonsils.  I had mine taken out and the dentist numbed me so I didn't feel a thing; but he was literally putting his knee in my chest and had my head held down to get mine out.  Still didn't feel a thing...|`|wrLu93C9aa	get all of them yanked out!

It is an arrestable offense, however, it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Another example of "obstructing" for your information:<br>  Also, when you are driving on the road and flash your bright lights at on-coming traffic to let them know a cop is around, in some states that is considered obstruction as well.

1i8i22oNaa	If anyone really knew when to put their money back in, they'd be rich. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, you should never put all your money in the market... nothing wrong with high interest FDIC money market, savings, cd's for some of your money... then mutual funds and bonds for the rest.<br>  <br>  Kind of breaks up the risk if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the market is going to fall some more or stay about the same untill it finds out  more about what Obama is going to do.  So far, Obama has been very anti-business with his policy and as most Americans know, it's the businesses that actually hire people, buy product to sell to the consumer, etc.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who claims that business isn't what keeps this country ticking is LOST.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, the government played a huge role in CAUSING this mess.  I still think Frank and Pelosi should be investigated for possible corrupt ties with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  They should be called to explain themselves in front of congress and all the American people just like the "corrupt ceo's".... especially since they were the ones to block investigations of Fannie and Freddie years before this crisis even happend and Fannie and Freddie were MAJOR contributors to Frank.<br>  <br>  Just some food for thought.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	When you see it start to rise agian, youll notice it.

AA11284831	Garnishments are the result of a court order.  Once the creditor got the judgment against her the court would have requested financial information from her before ordering a garnishment.  <br>  <br>  If she ignored that order, the court would have entered a garnishment order at the maximum amount allowed by law.  Getting that changed after ignoring previous court orders is difficult.  She would generally have to prove that she never received proper notice of the court case against her.<br>  <br>  If she complied with the court's order for financial disclosure then that was taken into consideration when the garnishment order was issued and she'd have to appeal the order to have it reduced.<br>  <br>  In either case she probably needs to consult with an attorney.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	The quickest way is to Pay Off The Debt...<br>  She should not have ignored all of those letters...<br>  She could have prevented this by just talking<br>  to the Creditor...

Tough question.  On one hand, Castro has been a pretty tough dictator these years, locking people up in political prisons, killing opposition figures, and supporting such terrible civil wars around the world, like the one in Angola that only ended fairly recently.  He was a Soviet pawn at a time when the Soviet Union aimed to destroy capitalism and our way of life.  He is not a friend of the United States.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I can't see how he is any different from China.  Why do we trade with China, and blatantly overlook their human rights abuses, yet keep an embargo on Cuba that only punishes the Cuban people?  Why do we as a nation argue that integrating China more into the global economy will help contribute to their democratization, yet we don't believe the same could be true with Cuba?<br>  <br>  So Castro is a pretty bad guy, but our policy toward Cuba has been misguided for some time.

RfxyVIh4aa	Send him a reply letter that states something to the effect of the following:<br>  <br>  Dear Name:<br>  <br>  Your facility failed to provide the services you were contracted to provide.  Specifically, I advised you on numerous occasions that my child was being hit by other children in this facility which indicated inadequate supervision on the part of the adults.  Despite my complaints, you did nothing to make my child more safe.  Additionally, my child's teacher quit and the facility's accountant was brought in to care for my child.  The original teacher was not supervising my child and the other children adequately.  I have no faith or confidence that an accountant will perform any better.  Since you failed to provide the services, you are in breach of the contract and I do not owe you anything.  Be advised that I will not pay you or any third party debt collector absent an order from a judge and if any negative information appears on my credit report as a result of your actions I will pursue a civil defamation action against you.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Your Name<br>  <br>  (And, obviously, keep a copy of the letter for your records.  This will go a long way toward proving that you didn't just pull your child out of there because you found a better deal somewhere else.  It will also put him on notice that you're not an easy mark.)|`|09ChIJZlaa	Tell him you'll see him in small claims court if you receive any such collection notice. I would write down everything you have about said incidents for future reference.|`|uegmmnOpaa	I would get a consultation with an attorney.  Some do if for free, but even if you have to pay it is not usually more then $20 or so.  A lot of times just a letter from an attorney is enough to scare away bullies.  I would say if what you are saying is true this Daycare has a lot to lose if you start making a fuss.  I would say that the circumstances that  lead you to your decision to remove your child make your previous contract with this daycare null and void.  However, if no one will go to bat with you, DHS sure will.  They would be all over that like a fly on a turd, lol.  Also, the Better Business Bureau, so other parents don't have to go through what you have.  Another option is to write every state senator and representative you can find for your state and county.  You can contact them online, you would be surprised how fast you may get a response.  Don't back down!  Remember, these people all work for you!  You may also consider talking to other parents whos children go there, they may be having similar problems but be afraid to do anything.  There is power is numbers.  Good luck!|`|dPLkNRNuaa	You can remind the guy of the verbal agreement....and he'll say "I never said any such thing". Then it's up to you to prove he said it. That's gonna be hard to do.<br>  <br>  Which means....the only thing to outline what happens when you pull your child out of day care is the written contract.<br>  <br>  I'd review all the contract/documents you signed when you enrolled you child at the day care. If it says you owe a 30 day notice...then you probably owe him the money. Consider it money well spent to get your daughter out of a bad situation. <br>  <br>  If you think the actions or lack of action at the daycare endangers the children ...file a complaint with the state agency that over sees daycare centers so they can do an investigation. Just make sure that you are confident your concern is valid and not motivated by anger.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Have you called the owner back reminding him about this verbal agreement?  That would be the first thing to do.  If he does not respond to your call, write a letter detailing what happened.  Be polite, be concise, do not rant, send the letter certified, and keep a copy for yourself.<br>  <br>  You can - and should - file a complaint with the BBB (Better Business Bureau.)
8dc5NMexaa	For your own daily and weekly planning purposes, you need to file a motion to modify custody.  In order to fully know that you can make your plans (from important ones to average daily ones) with your child without a possible interference, you need to know your schedule.  You should certainly be ready to offer your proof of days that he has visited with the child thereby showing his disregard (calendars are advised) and proof that "he provides nothing [your words]."  Other than the words, "I provide all the expenses... and he provides nothing," you have no reference to court-ordered child support.  You need to take care of that if you haven't, and it will be taken care of when you go to court for full custody.   Joint Custody should be only granted when two parents participate well in the raising of a child, in support, access, and decision-making.|`|XuG5g9Zgaa	Get an attorney.
zejFr1Ciaa	Smith and Wesson makes a great knife for the money. It's called the Swat Knife it has about a 4 1/2 " blade and only cost about $25.00 available at Cabela's. You should have no problem owning one at 18.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Laws differ between states. Walmart won't sell a knife to anyone under 16, though I don't think there is specifically a legal age to own a knife. Generally a pocket knife under 3.5 inches in blade length is legal. But as I said, laws differ between states.|`|emNCaAq7aa	In the US it depends on the state and sometimes on the city or town.<br>  If you are worried you have to check with the local police department.<br>  In general 2.5 to 3.5 inch blade on a folder is the legal length. <br>  In a lot of rural areas if you wear a non folder on your belt in a holster  it can be up to 6 to 8 inches long.<br>  Almost everywhere in town the age is 18 but again if out in the woods or most rural areas in runs around 14.<br>  Never ever carry, in your pocket, on your belt, in your vehicle or bag, any knife to school no matter what your age. Most schools have a zero tolerance rule that forces them to suspend you and call the police if you are found with any size knife.<br>  As to brands it all depends. I need a knife that is quick to deploy, clips to my pocket, can cut through a seat belt and open a box. So mine is a police special Spyderco with tanto tip and a half serrated blade. since you aren't a cop or a firefighter I doubt if that would be good for you.|`|yTkNT3OSaa	If you want specific legal information you'll have to add your location.<br>  <br>  As general information, it is the context in which you have the knife that determines whether it is considered a weapon or not rather than the length of the blade. For example, if you're trying to start a fight in the street while holding a 2" blade, it's a weapon. If you're building a shelter in the woods with a 6" blade, it's a tool.<br>  <br>  I've not heard of any laws that put an age limit on the ownership of knives; any legislation is usually an age limit at which a retailer can sell you a knife. If the knife is bought for you by a parent, then it shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  As for recommending brands it really depends on your budget. Spyderco make a knife for just about every situation, but prices range from under $50 to over $250. Benchmade is much the same (on a personal note, I only like a couple of Benchmade's knives, but like most of the Spyderco range, but you may be the opposite. I think Spyderco is the more ethical and customer focussed of the two). Buck and Kershaw generally focus on the cheaper side of the market, while still making good quality products. Columbia River Knife & Tool and Gerber are in the same space, but in my opinion, the quality of most of their knives is not as good as their competitors. There are many other noteworthy brands, but the above have the largest ranges.<br>  <br>  Seen as you said you work in the forest I'd recommend a Buck 110  as your first "real" knife. It's an absolute classic that still has a huge following (chances are your parents, and grandparents will have had one at some point and it's probably the most copied design of any knife)... plus, they're relatively inexpensive. If you're after a fixed-blade, then look at the Mora of Sweden range. They shouldn't cost more than $25 and are the best bargain in the market; they will have a limited life-span, but are incredibly good while they last.<br>  <br>  Another recommendation, for a basic pocket knife, is a Victorinox Swiss Army Knife (the most used brand in the world?). Very high build quality, pretty much rust-proof, will last a lifetime, and very affordable.

By the way I would say he would be greatly disappointed in the way things are now. Not because blacks don't have opportunities but because as a culture they strive for failure, and have no sense of responsibility. Its a shame but it is the truth.|`|eCbhygS8aa	He would say just.  <br>  <br>  Until we get to the point where we are colorblind and no longer sexist, AA is still needed. True, we elected a black president, so the majority of Americans realize MLK's dream, but racism is still prevalent. White privilege still exists in our society and it's a fact that our prisons are filled with black men - not bc black men commit more crimes, but bc black men are more likely to be prosecuted and convicted of committing a crime than a white man; be it because of money, or just being a more sympathetic figure than the other, blacks are held to a different standard. <br>  <br>  "Despite the fact that White youth aged 12-17 are as likely—or more likely—to sell or use drugs than Black youth, Black youth are three times as likely to be sent to an adult prison for drug offenses than White youth.7 This is in part due to automatic transfer laws that mandate youth charged with drug offenses within 1,000 feet of a school or public housing project be tried in adult court. Since schools and public housing projects are closer in proximity in urban areas than in rural and suburban areas, it is more likely for Black and Latino youth to be convicted under these laws. For example, between 1995 and 1999 in Cook County, Illinois, 99.2% of youth transferred to adult court under the automatic transfer laws were youth of color."<br>  <br>  <br>  Chris - Put your money where your mouth is.

Usually battlespace is owned by the Infantry and Cavalry and the Artillery sometimes handles areas more around the base, but that's up to the digression of the BCT CO.  Because you'll be outside the wire, you'll have the standard array of dangers...

If they made it here, they can make it back. What they don't realize is, it could be much worse. Look at their other options of other closer countries to Mexico. They made a choice to come here, they can make the choice of leaving if they don't like it. They should not come here expecting disneyland around every turn and to be showered with money, wealth, jobs, respect, etc......you have to earn those things and work hard for them.<br>  <br>  If I were the one complaining after moving to another country, that countries people would damn well be telling me to shut up or leave. I know this because most countries are not that tolerant as they want people to believe they are.

Something has to be good, if they came all the way over here right? Mexicans love their country but usually come here with the hope that they will make enough money to move back someday and live in Mexico. The reason they complain must be the anger that they know they have to stay here if they want those opportunities. Even americans admit our govt is crappy right now, so that's most everyone opinion, but I think it may be that they are mad they can't live in their country and flourish the same way they do here.

I've also been to juaréz (which is not as bad as people make it out to be.) the people there are very friendly, everyone i encountered spoke english. Not once did i see anything that we consider illegal in the united states going on down there. i stayed in a hotel there, walked the streets at night and i'm still alive. I didn't even see a single drug dealer. yet i can walk around syracuse NY at night and see a ton of them. I'm also first in my family to be born in the United States. and I find myself complaining constantly also. Granted, I'm appreciative to live here instead of britain (where my family is from). But our education and healthcare systems really need some help. and no matter where you are from, you will always complain about your living standards. tell me you've NEVER complained about anything in your life? you'd be lying.

kqW5WdQcaa	The North Koreans invaded South Korea with the intention of uniting Korea in 1950, starting the Korean War which ended unofficially in 1953.  North Korea is a hard-line Communist nation, while South Korea is a democracy.  South Korea is also supported militarily by the U.S., and North Korea by various nations rival to the U.S. (China, Russia, Pakistan).  So of course, that makes the two countries tense in regards to relations.  I don't think Clinton's visit will accomplish anything, as much as Rice's visit to Lebanon.  Its just a political show.  Basically, she's saying, we don't like North Korea building nuclear weapons and see China as the North's biggest ally.  That's not anything new.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Neither side is "demanding war"<br>  <br>  After 1945 when Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation the Soviet's were responsible for the part of the country north of the 38th parallel and the United States for the territory south of the 38th.  Both sides installed governments to their liking in their respective territories.  In 1950 the North Korean communist government that was installed by Josef Stalin tried to end this artificial division of the country by military force and invaded the south.  They were eventually pushed back by a U.N. force primarily backed by the United States and the war ended after 3 years in a stalemat at roughly the original dividing line.  <br>  <br>  To this day the north remains a strict communist totalitarian state and one of the poorest nations on earth while the South eventually flourished into a highly prosperous democracy.  Both sides want to see the country reunited but on their own terms.  The war never really ended - they sides just signed a cease fire - so both sides are on a permanent war footing and some shooting does take place, but not all-out conflict.|`|ggBfHk1waa	Honestly, I haven't followed it much recently.  I feel Kim Jong Il (if he's still in charge) is an old school, evil dictator - the likes of which we rarely see.  I don't think we can always figure out his motives.  I also feel North Korea is receiving some sort of assistance from China which makes things very complicated.  I wish we weren't so bogged down in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and we could put more political and military energy toward southeast asia.  Frankly, South Korea could be in trouble, even with our massive military presence there.  Let's just hope cooler heads prevail!  Hillary's chance to shine?  I'm not holding my breath, but I wish her the best.|`|tpn7iR48aa	The korean war ended in a truce not a clear victor or peace treaty. For this reason, the two nations are technically still at war. The more developed and wealthy south(with strong alliances and ties to economic powerhouses) along with the US (their most powerful ally) has imposed sanctions on the north. This has been going on for years. The north, led by Kim Jong-Il have been threatening for quite some time to lash out at the south and there have indeed been several skirmishes at sea over territory and border lines. While the north has not seriously backed up these threats, many people now think that their talk is growing weak and to show the world that they mean business, they are going to have to take action. I dont know if that is true but i do know that they have a very irrational leader and i wouldn't put it past him even if it meant the destruction of his country. Clinton's visit is to talk about sanctions and other measures that could be taken to encourage the north to come back to negotiations concerning their nuclear program. I think that the North is tired of being pushed around and is trying to show that they will not sit by idly while others decide their fate. Although i must say that they got themselves into this position with their history of negotiations. What else could they expect to happen. We know they have nukes, their missiles are not always going to fail, it is time to cut through the crap and seriously reprimand their government (not their people), or contend sometime in the near future with radicals who are in a militaristic sense, technologically up to date.|`|etszzyataa	North people are taller, and the South people are shorter, oh yeah and the North people are communist and they are bad.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	North bad, south good.

President Obama has drafted an experienced group of professionals to form his cabinet in exactly the way every President does.  That is how the system works.    It is hypocritical to complain of his lack of experience and then criticize when he goes out and hires some.  It is also unfair to judge the promise of change less than a month into an administration.  Like it or not we will all have to wait and see what we got.    As for his leadership abilities, well, he won the nomination.  He persuaded a nervous nation that he was the only alternative to another four years of Bush league mismanagement, and won the election as well.  Time alone will tell how good he is.

Someone needs to pay for all those orange barrels.  When I lived in Cols, someone told me they had been working on I-315 for over 20 years!    You can go to the court date and explain what happened and then take your chances.  One thing is that the fine is usually lower if you go to court so that would be one option.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	If you had 'reasonable control' over the vehicle, the accident would not have happened.... period.    The officer was correct in the citation and you'll not be able to beat it in court.|`|AA11089860	That's a pretty dickish move on the officer's part...    The way the law is set up, there are countless contradictions and accusatory finger pointings that cancel out other parts because.... well.... that's what makes the most sense (?).    All tongue in cheek aside, it is true that you lost control of your vehicle, and therefore, you failed to maintain reasonable control.    Do I think you deserve a ticket? Hell no.  Are you going to be able to defend yourself? Hell no.    At least for California traffic court, they only let you plead "Guilty" or "Not Guilty."   If you plead "Guilty", then you have to pay.  If you plead "Not Guilty", then you have a chance to argue. However, since by pleading "Not Guilty" you are saying that you didn't perform the act, and the officer is lying, they can easily prove that you DID do whatever you're in there for, and nail you for the ticket.  How's that for fantastically circular logic?  In addition, if you plead "Not Guilty" and are found guilty, you lose the option of traffic court. They essentially bully you into pleading "Guilty".|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I'd fight it tooth and nail.  You are right.  There are no witnesses to what happened.  The officer made assumptions and ticketed you.      Suppose that a car was coming right at you?  If you didn't move to the side of the road, you would have had a head on accident !  You moved to prevent injury to yourself and others.  Since the accident never occurred you have no proof.    Did the officer indicate any other factors in giving you this ticket?  Skid marks, cameras, other drivers' statements?   Do you have a history of tickets/accidents that may have influenced his decision to ticket you?    I'd fight it.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Just go to court and prove that you intended to drive into the ditch.    Otherwise you DID NOT maintain control of your vehicle.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	There is evidence at the scene that you might not think about, that a trained police officer would see without fail.    How far off the road was your car?  Damage to your vehicle, if so ... how much?  Position of your vehicle relative to the road, facing traffic?  ... facing the direction of travel?    In my time I have driven front wheel drive, rear wheel drive and 4 wheel drive vehicles, and slid off the road a few times as a young man.    An officer responded to every time I slid off the road, and I'll be hanged if every one of them wasn't correct as to exactly what happened in every case!  When I had a few years experience, I learned to control the vehicle I was driving under all but the worst conditions.  I also learned to get off the road during the worst conditions!  Haven't slid off a road in 20 years.  I must be doing something right.    4 wheel drive does not mean that you won't get stuck or slide off the road ... it just means that if you do, you are going to be in one heck of a fix.  4 wheel drive will help you get moving, not turn or slow down.  Reasonable control of a vehicle means staying on the road.|`|AA10566329	you left the roadway, control is staying on the road, therefore you lacked reasonable control|`|X6RwSrJjaa	I live in Cincinnati, and your a idiot if your plead guilty in traffic court.

Regardless of whether or not you can pass your psych eval, they're going to look in your record for reasons to disqualify you.

Only his didn't include much for anyone other than the banks and CEO's of those banks. I also recall that there was no accountability and most of that money was wasted on frivolous trips, junkets and plane rides! ;) <br>  <br>  At least with Obama's spending, our country will see improvement. Our roads and bridges will be repaired. For our citizens who are losing their jobs and need assistance, there will be funds to tide them over. There is also money for our schools, which is greatly needed. But that's okay that you bash it. But when you lose your jobs, don't stick your hand out. That would be hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  Oh and while I'm at it.....<br>  <br>  Pick up a copy of Readers Digest this month. There is an article in there about how BILLIONS have been lost, stolen, or scammed from us in Iraq while Bush was in charge. A lot of it went to bogus companies that we paid to build schools and such. For example: $24.4 million was spent in an electricity venture that was paid in full and never built. $15 billion in Pentagon payments to contractors could not be accounted for. In one 2005 report, $8.8 billion meant to help rebuild the country went missing. To make matters worse, our government, late in 2008, fired several top fraud monitors within the Iraqi government , making it easier for people to help themselves. All of this is happening while Iraq is sitting on $90 billion in oil revenues. But it gets worse...they aren't using their own banks. They are depositing it in other countries. In 2007, The US Treasury paid $435.6 million in interest payments to the Iraqi government for the $10 billion in surplus oil revenues they have stashed at the Federal Reserve Bank in NY.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	About as many times as President Obama has gone on TV to tell us how bad the economy is and how scared we should be.

TsjqzanQaa	Well, I was one of the ones who thought that Obama truly represented change; I was wrong.<br>  <br>  What really was the breaking point for me was when he appointed Geithner as Treasury Secretary, and it was all over the news tha Geithner hadn't paid his taxes.<br>  <br>  Then he tried to appoint Daschle, and public outrage became too strong to ignore, so after he had said that he "would stand behind" Daschle, he had to dump Daschle, and then Obama admitted,"I screwed up."<br>  Those were his own words.<br>  <br>  Subsequently, we still have Geithner as Treasury Secretary.        If the Daschle appointment was a "screw up," then Geithner's appointment is equally wrong, and Geithner should be fired.<br>  <br>  For Obama to approve of politicians who don't pay their own taxes, the same huge taxes that they saddle the rest of us with, is the height of hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  It's indicative that there's one standard of "justice" for politicians, especially when their cronies of Obama, and a separate one for average Americans.<br>  <br>  I expected better from Obama, and I'm bitterly disappointed by his actions.<br>  <br>  However, I'm still convinced that McCain would have wrecked our country completely by following the Bush/Cheney policies that have brought us to this point.<br>  <br>  As far as Afghanistan goes, Russia tried, at the height of their military power, to conquer Afghanistan, and they failed miserably, wasting lives and money.<br>  <br>  Our government seems intent on the same thing.<br>  <br>  We don't need more wars that we can't afford.    Bush exhausted the wealth of America, and we need to solve our own problems at home before our government tries to run the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  I also feel that this stimulus package will be the biggest mistake that our government could make, and they make plenty of them!<br>  <br>  It's just another way for the corrupt politicians, the special interests and cronies to bilk the taxpayers out of even more monumental loot than ever before.<br>  <br>  Our government spends enormous amounts of money, but seldom do they spend even $1 wisely.<br>  <br>  Anyone who believes a politician is a fool.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Obviously, you weren't paying attention.

Obama is smart enough to know that we can't just up and pull out. We have to finish what we started. He NEVER said he was going to bring everyone home in his first month. He said he was hoping to have most out in 16 months. Perhaps you weren't paying attention. We, his supporters, were. <br>  <br>  Afghanastan, where he sent the additional troops, is the war we should have been fighting all along. Iraq was a pit stop to benefit Bush and his cronies. We never should have been there to begin with. You can't blame him for finishing what Bush never should have started in the first place. <br>  <br>  How do you KNOW the stimulus package is going to mess things up even more?

(that is how long he has been in office)  also, they are complaining that the stimulus package won't work, and it hasn't even started. that is like looking at the other football team and saying "oh we are going to lose bad.<br>  <br>  May I am just made of tougher stuff, but I have been through worst, and can only hope for the best.<br>  <br>  and i think anybody that lives in the US and wants him to fail is just plain stupid, I didn't Vote for Bush, but I still wanted him to be a good president, why wouldn't I.<br>  <br>  I will believe it has failed when it fails, and not when some snot nose college  kid that is angry because their parents can't afford to get them a new car this year tells me it will fail.|`|trMsK86jaa	I don't recall ever actually praising him.<br>  <br>  edit; infact, i only praised McCain Once, because i thought that if anyone, a Maverick would be able to grant the wishes of the American People and not the American Government.<br>  <br>  Whether or not he intended to share this message is beyond me, of course.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	They're back in class, too busy to watch the news, and could care less about the economy since daddy still pays their cell phone and tuition.|`|1i8i22oNaa	Did MSNBC stop covering the war... they used to bring us daily casualty counts during the elections.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	crawling back into their holes.|`|SGwkPy62aa	They woke up after their bender of drugs and alcohol and said; "I voted for who"|`|XuLVfj1caa	Anyone who says they have any idea about what the stimulus package will do for our economy is full of it.  I don't even think economists know.  This is uncharged territory and no one knows how this will end up.  I applaud them for trying what they think will work.  As for the troops, you're confusing the two wars.  Obama promised to bring the troops in Iraq home within 16 months.  That drawdown has already begun.  In fact, the 17,000 troops you mentioned that are headed for Afghanistan were originally headed for Iraq.  So, 17,000 will rotate out of Iraq and they will not be replaced.  So, he's kept his word there.  He also said during the campaign that he would send more troops to Afghanistan and fund that war properly.  He has begun that process as well.  So, there's still no comparison between Bush and Obama that you can draw just yet.  He has done more in 30 days than Bush got done in all of 2008.  Whether you agree with what he's done or not, he's definitely at work.|`|9e71d6ba9ed0a15b36038ee62db89bbaaa	When they were talking about change, they meant their diapers.

The inclusion shifts the ride's focus away from world peace and how we're all very similar despite our differences and instead turned it into a character hunt. <br>  <br>  One argument is that if Walt Disney had wanted to include Disney characters he would have put them in there since he oversaw the creation and design of the attraction in 1963.

It looks like they have three or four times as many people as they need for the juries, so most people don't get chosen.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Depending how many people they were called.

z88IMXNFaa	That's because it's not true.  The US Government has never stopped issuing visas to spouses.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	The above responses are correct.  Immediate relatives of US citizens are eligible for visa and green card.  It can be a long process, but they are eligible and there are no numerical limits like there are in other visa categories.  However, if the non-citizen spouse entered the US unlawfully, this will probably prevent them from getting their green card unless Congress acts to reopen 245(i).|`|yTdQUqVRaa	It's not true.<br>  <br>  There's no numerical limit on spousal visas and I know more than a couple of people who are currently going through the process.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	There is no such evidence to my knowledge|`|AA11702773	That is nonsense, which is why you can't find it.
axiA5mMoaa	A drug dealer is an exploiter & a drug user a sick person but in prison they are both convicted prisoners & as prisoner will be treated equally.|`|7bb7def5791e75742a5d4105132faf16aa	No. Drug users are as guilty as the ones selling them. I feel bad for the users because I'm sure that there was a day that they were not drug users but they were misled and outsmarted to even start using drugs in the first place. So most drug users are not smarter then the sellers. The sellers tend to be smart and avoid using the drugs. They want to make money rather than being addicted to it. In part, they are like normal business people but criminals for destroying the community. Look at Mexico, if we don't do something, I'm afraid that drug curtails will take over the United States.|`|880ec6527fe04278aef13b29d116c9d7aa	It wasn't that long ago addicts were treated differently by the courts and given treatment for their addiction. Regan anti-drug policies changed that and made the drug problem in this country worse!! In fact alot of them are mentally ill and never get any treatment for that either! The system is broken.|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	I think the whole system needs an overhaul. There's millions and millions of our tax dollars being spent to imprison people that are guilty of only possession. Our prisons are overcrowded and violent. Criminals are not rehabilitated. Many come out of prison in worse shape then they went in. Being raped and beaten in prison is not a fair punishment for smoking a little weed.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	not really, if someone is willing to buy drugs then it's their fault, not to be mean or anything. and if someone is willing to sell drugs to a person knowing that they could get hooked and knowing that the end result could be devastating then it's their fault too. ultimately, their not usually bad people, they just get caught in the same wrong cycle...one is just as 'bad' as the other...|`|9a58c6956a0dadd7d2fd7cf682a85b08aa	Drug users---should be FINED and made to undergo therapy to break their addiction.<br>  <br>  NOT PRISON.<br>  <br>  Dealers on the other had should be thrown in a dark hole|`|qxUNmdd6aa	nooo way, they are both equally illegal.<br>  you shouldnt do or sell drugs in the first place.<br>  <br>  im embarrassed to say i live in this drug century.|`|nG9nxMySaa	i don't think drug users should go to prison in the first place.|`|jpqXyLItaa	No drugs should be illegal, no one should go to jail for using, selling, growing, or doing anything with them. Non violent drug related offenders cost our government a shitload of money to keep in jail and take valuable prison space from people who actually need to be in  prison.<br>  <br>  The only penalty for drug use should be the effects of that drug and whatever else it may cause. If you die from a heroin overdose, you brought it upon yourself, and that'll be a lesson you won't forget. Throw your life away to meth or crack and become homeless and lose everything you've ever loved, sounds good to me.<br>  <br>  We should be able to do whatever we want with our bodies. People who do drugs make a conscious choice to do them and accept whatever health effects and risk of addiction there may be.<br>  <br>  The fact that there are people in jail for owning, smoking, or selling a plant is absurd to me.|`|mFszeCb5aa	um yeah|`|PwHQSAxvaa	In a way, the user is a victim. The dealers are a bigger problem. But the real prize is the Mister Big.|`|orfmhb2waa	yes|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Drug dealers should be executed. That would help to solve the problem. Actually, they should be declared terrorists, and hunted down and killed by our military in the streets.<br>  Drug users shouldn't go to jail. However, our society should stop this BS coddling of them, as if they're "victims". They're not innocent victims. They created the problem themselves.<br>  Sink or swim. Straighten up or die. Either way, it's doing society a favor.|`|dSpLfZFnaa	Yes.  Drug dealers generally get longer sentences than users and are more likely to have gun related charges which will land them in medium or maximum security facilities.  Users are usually in minimum security facilities which translates to better treatment.  Whether users should be locked up or not is an endless debate.  However, most users agree they should be locked up because of the path their life was taking.  It is sad that it takes prison to wake some users up, but the ones I have talked to generally agree it was best for them.|`|DIuE4vshaa	In prison almost everyone is treated the same. Except for child molesters...they got to prison with a mark on their head.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Yeah...drug users should not have to bend over for the soap in the prison shower.
fOS41FAfaa	I'd like to say it depends on what they were dealing, and who they were dealing to.<br>  <br>  Dealers who sell to kids are scum.<br>  Dealers who sell to adults who know what they're getting into aren't that bad. Some could even be seen as "street pharmacists" <br>  Dealers who sell more dangerous drugs are worse than dealers who sell safer drugs. <br>  <br>  Some users are more prone to addiction than others, but its their decision, and they are the only one to blame. Prison should not be used as a way of treating addiction.<br>  <br>  In prison, everyone should be treated equally, except for those who pose a threat to others.|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	Yes.  All drug and alcohol users or addicts should be treated like a sick patient.  At least the first time.  Most of the drug and alcohol abusers that are currently in prison have probably never been to rehab, and their court/judge never offered it either.  This is one of the main reasons why our prison systems are overcrowded.  If they fail rehab, or re-offend, using drugs/DUI, then I think you have to send them to prison.  But people in this country and our judical system are to quick to judge and think that everyone that breaks the law should go to prison....Until they break the law, and believe that they should catch a break because this was the only time they did anything wrong.|`|vAL1Rahaaa	well.... i do because most kids at my school smoke weed. and i think that if the person wasnt selling it they couldnt get it or they would have never bought it so i think that the users just need rehab but the dealers need to be locked up because most dealers now a days are selling to minors like my friend who is 13 and he smokes and snorts xanax|`|taduoyUHaa	It is my opinion that if a person has a problem with alcohol or drugs, then it is of no use to put them in prison.  Drug dealers yes but addicts are a victim of many things and prison is not going to help them|`|LaiANzeAaa	yes. but only becuase i think capital punishment should be used on drug dealers|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Yes of course. Addiction is a disease and that definition is accepted by the Surgeon General and the World Health Organization. One can become addicted by drinking alcohol, prescribed narcotics or just trying out an illegal drug. Before you know it you are hooked and the drug takes over and you do anything you can to get it.<br>  <br>  Dealers try and get people addicted. I've seen their tricks and once they find their customers they are responsible for the destruction of people's lives.|`|F32uPjAraa	No, you can't have one without the other.|`|5SmX1oLlaa	yes i belive they should be treated diff. a dealer is selling to an addict that can't help thereselves. most addicts will tell you they wish they could stop or never have started. a dealer knows what happens to people so they should get the max.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Yes, the users should be in prison the dealers should be on death row.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Hell ya.....The dealers don't use it they only supply it...Some users can't stop using on there own|`|8SPKsHozaa	yes users should get a free muchines card because they get really hungry... while the dealers get really gay in prison

And if he isnt showing any intrest of the child then maybe he will sign his rights over to you.

emNCaAq7aa	I can only tell you how my city/county handle it. Other places other exact procedures differ.  The following is basic and every case is different.<br>  After arrest the guy is taken to a district lockup for photos and fingerprinting. To do this the arresting officer writes up an arrest report outlining his probable cause for the arrest. The report is reviewed by the watch commander and if Ok'ed the guy is taken to the lockup for the booking process. He is not yet charged with the crime. In the lockup he is fingerprinted and photographed. He is then usually turned over to detectives. The detectives gather all the current evidence up and contact the prosecutors office. They request charges from the prosecutor laying out their evidence. Before charging the prosecutors office interviews everyone, including the arrestee. Then prosecutor decides if charges are appropriate. If the prosecutor does not approve charges but directs the detectives to do something else the bad guy is held either in an interview room or in the local lockup for up to 24 hours or 72 hours with independent approval of the original probable cause. If in that time they satisfy the prosecutors office the prosecutor places charges. If not approved he is released without charging. In all homicide cases the prosecutors office has the final say on charging.<br>  So now he is charged. In the time this took his prints have cleared, meaning he does not have any warrants etc. so he can go to court. Before the next court call he is turned over to the sheriffs office for housing in the county jail. He is scheduled to see the central preliminary felony judge that afternoon. The prosecutors office may take the case to the sitting grand jury in the AM and get an indictment or plead the case in front of the judge for a judicial finding of probable cause in the afternoon. GJ find no bill or judge finds no probable cause he is let go.<br>  After the indictment or the finding he is held in the county jail for bonding or trial. Felony murder ( a homicide committed while committing another felony) in my state is the worst and normally has no bond.

More on the maintenance side of the house, though, and more hardware intensive than software intensive.  And your schooling will be focus on electronic principles.<br>  <br>  Is it related to your desired major?  Somewhat as you will be using specific software to maintain your equipment and diagnose any malfunctions.  Unless I'm mistaken, computer engineering is more about software/OS development and integrating it with the hardware.<br>  <br>  Will you be able to attend college?  Sure but it depends to where you are assigned.  The operational tempo of your unit will determine how many courses, if any, you may be able to take each semester.  Not to mention that the colleges available at your duty location may not offer your major.<br>  <br>  Now to give you a hard time - first, it's Valedictorian (not -ean).  And if you were a valedictorian, you should have maxed out the ASVAB with a 99.

3Wxx2FPkaa	Temporary business US Work Visas Explained below:<br>  <br>  The L-1 Visa<br>  <br>  The L-1 visa is afforded to executives, managers and those with specialized knowledge within a foreign company to transfer to a US affiliate, subsidiary, branch or parent company. In other words, the availability of this work visa in the US facilitates intra-company transfers to associate US entities of foreign companies for those employed within the above named positions.<br>  <br>  A qualifying relationship must exist between the foreign entity and the US company for eligibility for L1 visa status. Both companies must have common ownership of shares which would determine whether one company is the subsidiary, parent company, affiliate or branch of the other company.<br>  <br>  The US or foreign entity must file a petition to prove eligibility for an L1 visa to work in the US. Upon the approval of the petition, the prospective beneficiary is required to apply for L1 visa status at a US embassy or consulate.<br>  <br>  Spouses and children may relocate with the L1 beneficiary on L2 status. Children may attend school and spouses may work. Spouses must apply for work authorization.<br>  <br>  A work visa in the US must be corroborated by a social security number <br>  <br>  E-2 Visa Conditions are given hereunder. After a comparison of the 2 conditions, you will determine, whether it was illegal to work.<br>  <br>  The E-2 Visa<br>  <br>  The E-2 category of US visas is available to foreign business persons who have established a company in the states and wish to enter the country to manage the business. It is otherwise known as the treaty investor visa. It is available to nationals of countries that maintain a treaty with the United States.<br>  <br>  To qualify for this classification of USA business visas, the alien must make a substantial and non-marginal investment in establishing the business. US Immigration guidelines prescribe an investment of no less than $100,000 to meet the ‘substantial’ investment standards. The amount invested to qualify will, however, be determined by factors such as the size and nature of the business. For E2 visa purposes, it is judicious to invest as much as possible as the adequacy of the investment is a subjective determination by the US Immigration Services. An investment of at least $1,000,000 automatically qualifies as a substantial investment for E2 visa purposes.<br>  <br>  As mentioned above, the investment must not be marginal. The estimated income generated by the business must be sufficient to support the E-2 visa beneficiary and his/her family.<br>  <br>  US Immigration laws require that the E-2 visa applicant owns at least 50 percent of the business. Another national of a treaty country or US national/limited company must own the remaining 50 percent. Otherwise, the prospective E-2 visa beneficiary should own 100% of the shares.<br>  <br>  Spouses and unmarried children of the beneficiary are entitled to derivative E visas. Spouses may be authorised to work by filing form I-765 employment authorization application.<br>  <br>  Amongst other documents a five year business plan must be submitted with other evidentiary documents to support the stance that the business will in a reasonable duration become a viable successful business entity that would provide more than a marginal income.<br>  <br>  The E-2 visa is initially issued for a duration of five years, but may be issued for two years if there is some speculation as to whether the business will be successful. <br>  <br>  The visa can be extended indefinitely as long as the investment that supported the business originally still exists and it is still a viable business entity for E-2 standards.<br>  <br>  <br>  An E-2 beneficiary and his/her dependants may change their status and acquire USA green cards. However, this cannot be achieved simply on the platform of being an E2 visa holder. Available circumstances such as marriage to a US citizen would have to form the basis for a petition for green card status for the E2 visa holder.<br>  <br>  The maximization of one’s E-2 status within the US should be discussed in detail with specialist USA immigration lawyers. <br>  <br>  If you don't arrive at a conclusion consult law specialist<br>  Solutions In Law PC<br>  9595 Wilshire Blvd<br>  Suite 900<br>  Beverly Hills, Los Angeles<br>  California 90212<br>  USA<br>  <br>  Tel: 310 492 4311, info@solutionsinlaw.co.uk
n2oEhdZiaa	It sounds like they own you and they will be planning on providing transporation for you to the mobilization site and you will be going to Iraq with the Texas guys.  You can try JAG though.|`|XyXDs8vcaa	Talk to the Unit Administrator of the unit you're doing your RST's with. They'll coordinate with the commander. They shouldn't have attached you to a unit so far away, I don't understand why no one caught that when you first enlisted. You could change your MOS, but since there is a stop movement in place, no classes will be scheduled. What type of unit is this anyway? Keep a paper trail going also. I agree with svt93, it's almost scary what some of these units do to their soldiers.|`|TS5z0SPwaa	Before you go to JAG make sure you have everything documented & make copies before you hand them anything. If the unit cannot function without you they should not be going. 11 series.....
ZjcH929kaa	Actually  yes you are liable. If you do not want to be held liable, you need to post a "No Trespassing" sign on your property and take photos of it for documentation purposes. You can even go as far as printing a "no climbing tree sign" on your yard next to the tree (also taking pictures for documentation purposes). If a child does climb your tree, falls out, breaks their arm, and the parents sue you. You will need to get an attorney, show the pictures and have the exact dates of when you placed these signs on your property to show how long they had been posted there. You can go as far as written affidavits from relatives, and neighbors confirming they had seen the signs on your property. You will win this case. "He who has notes wins" in trials. and it will be dismissed. Another alternative would be to have the parents sign a release of liability that is drawn up by your attorney if the child plays on your property including but not limited to climbing the trees. Most parents wouldn't sign this, and just keep their kids out of your yard. They might now be very friendly neighbors after that, but in a sue-crazy society we live in, you can never be too cautious.|`|b8B0gXDmaa	yes so the best thing you could do  to prevent that from happening is to put in the back Yard and watch the kids when there out there Intel they are about 16 or older|`|pZu6Mk42aa	yes you r responsible. im not sure how to prevent it, i think if you post a sign saying to stay off the tree then that reduces your liability|`|V5AliBPMaa	You wont be responsible if your property is private, or if you have a sign that says don't climb the tree or something.|`|88f1a343b6666f44a54943a922a50329aa	yes, yes, yes, hope you have homeowners ins.|`|tm9egUBraa	Whereabouts are you from?|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	by encouraging people to climb the tree you could open yourself up to being sued if a kid or anyone gets hurt , especially if you are home and supposedly supervising the kids.<br>  you would be better off putting up a sign prohibiting the climbing of the tree.<br>  tell the other parents that their kids must be supervised by them if they intend to climb it and ignore the sign.|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	It depends.  If you have put reasonable precautions up, such as a fence, maybe made the tree not that viewable from the street, etc then no, you generally are not.<br>  <br>  However if it's considered something that a child could easily be attracted to and try to climb, then you quite possibly could be.<br>  <br>  It's a strange section of the law.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	I would say no ... as long as you don't give them permission to climb the tree and shoo them out of it when you see them there.  You could plant a nice flower bed around the tree or some large hostas to try to prevent them from climbing it in the first place.|`|DIuE4vshaa	If you give permission...your liable. If they climb and fall while you are not at home, they were trespassing.<br>  <br>   If you are so worried, never give permission to anyone and put a NO TRESSPASING sign on the tree.|`|6qPndPvXaa	a. yes you would be thats why you have homeowners..<br>  b. plant it in the back yard.<br>  c. by the time that tree gets big enough to climb  your kids will be in  college.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	You are Responsible for Everything that <br>  happens any where on your Property...<br>  No matter what...
