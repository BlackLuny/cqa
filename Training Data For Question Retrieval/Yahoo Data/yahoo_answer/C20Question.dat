20090205044226AAKXzrZ	Politics & Government;Government	Will Sonia Gandhis" mistake be costly that will seperate Indian Unity?	Hi friends, dear Brother and Sister of India.....   I have my question and i would like you to see from a very neytral point of view.      We are aware of the situation in Southern Indian part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.   Srimathi Sonia in the name of taking revenge of LTTE, her action has caused thousands of innocent Tamilian lives in Sri Lanka.   This has never been the case when Barhthia Janatha Party was in power, also that Indian and Pakistan & Chinese military intereference along with the Sri Lankan army has overpowered the Tamil Tigers who were holding on to thier self declared Tamil Elam for past 30yrs, it is a fact that Sri Lanka alone cannot fight the LTTE so India has aided Sri Lanka under Srimthi Sonia Ghandi revenge motive, this has caused absolute hatred among Tamilians in Tamil Nadu and around the world.      If she claim that since it was purely revenge taking on the LTTE, but her so call revenge has casused thousands of innocent lives as sri lankan army Govt has taken this very situationas an advantage to kill as many Tamils as possible, so having Sonia directly or Indirectly involve, will the thousand of hurt and effected individuals not want to take revenge on Sonia ?      So bacically it is a continuation of grudge, till now there is so much of unclear issue over Rajeev Ji killings, CIA, Israel Mosaad and BJP are also some key suspects and according to some experts LTTE were like scapegoats having forcefully blamed.      We never came across Mahthama Gandhiji"s grandchildren wanting to take revenge on RSS or BJP party or its members.   We do not see muslims in India wanting to take revenge of BJP      So why has Srimathi Sonia overeacted ?   Having been to Chennai, having seen the signs telling    "Indian Govt has cheated and betrayed Tamils" i as an Indian, am feeling very hurt , our nation has voiced out for Fijian Indians but have let go and responsible for the death of thousand Tamils across the land.   In the name of Ramayana, we have close link with Lanka, Lanka geographically was part of India once just that due to plate movement the landmass has parted,    the later inhanbited sinhalese greediness of over dominance of Tamils was the key issue to the ethnic conflict and the birth of the rebel groups. Now having nocticed the current Indian goverment is behind all this mess, don"t we Indian see that a foreigner has parted the Indians of the north and south.   The British did this then, now an Italian has done this      Pope has now taken advantage of the situation in Lanka to voice out firmly and co incidently there is deep concentration in Lanka now, the Chief for Internationl Law has also mentioned that Sri Lankan army General Kotabaya must be prosecuted for the Tamil Massacre.      So Christainity have now came into the picture, this will be costly to Hinduism too since majority of Sri Lankan Tamils are Hindus and the Sinhalese are Buddhist.   Srimathi Sonia a born Catholic not only seperated the Indians but also Hindus

Now we are at the door of another depression (already for millions) and growing worse with each passing day.   My wife lost her job and for my company, work has slowed to a crawl.  I was worried about how was I going to keep my employees and how in the world was I going to keep on up bills?   Then he signed into act universal health care for our children.   I had to step back and think about this. Here I was concerned about work and our home, and a man I never meant just secured my children health care when soon I may not be able to afford it.     When I casted my vote, it was for hope.  Now, I am sure we made the correct choice.  I pray to the Lord for my forgiveness of selfishness and pray for this man for the task before him to continue to do the right things for our great county.   Times may get worse before they get better, but now I believe and trust in the man who we appointed as President.      My question is directed to all who has children:  How do you feel knowing now your children will have the health care they need. Even now as parents we loose our jobs and are unable to provide all the things we gave before this hardship that is upon us?

Shouldn't he be spending more time trying to fix the economy and less time making poor people THINK he is "sticking it to the man"?       http://money.cnn.com/news/specials/story...

20090205060245AAmyed1	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Would marriage help with custody battle?	My girlfriend and I were friends for years and while she was in a short relationship she became pregnant after 1 month. She kept the baby and we started dating while she was pregnant and the other guy was too busy having a good time with his buddies to help her out through it all, although he wanted to be a dad, he didnt want to show any responsibility to prove he would be a good one.   Now my girlfriends baby, Natalie, is 7 months old and the father wants to gain some custody of her, but neither of us want that... at all... he moves from place to place constantly(its his way of not being homeless), goes out playing poker and drinking often, I dont even think he would wake up to a baby screaming if he were alseep. We're both scared he will get a lot of custody and horrible things will happen.   Question: If my girlfriend and I got married now (rather than the one more year we were going to wait) would that help our chances at all? It may be too soon, we know, but we both feel it would be better than the alternative by leaps and bounds. Ive been there for Natalie since day one, and ive known my girlfriend for years since before all this. Please give us some advice if you can.. Much thanks!!

Can I sue a doctor that prescribes my ex husband pills when he doesn't need them?   My ex has been getting pills for several years from a doctor. He is now addicted to them and it has affected me in several ways. The big one is that our two children suffer because their father is doped up and they basically have no relationship with him. I have to see them hurt and have broken promises. Also he's constantly in jail due to his drug addiction so therefore does not hold a job, so I don't recieve any child support, nor have for the past 8 years.   Once he over dosed. I walked in to his mother's to find him passed out on the floor. When the ambulance got there we found six different bottles in his room, empty, all perscribed within the week, all were medications that you would get a high off of.   When is enough, enough? Why can "doctor's" get away with this. They took an oath to protect our health, not destroy it. He's basically a legal drug dealer, that has ruined my life.   Do I have a suit?

The bank were mandated to make the sub prime loans by Federal judges and acts of congress. One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.

It just came to my attention that the state I reside in decriminalized marijuana in 1979. This means that they treat the possession of small amounts of marijuana (such as 1-3.5 oz) as a civil offense instead of a criminal offense.      I know that with a civil offense you still get a citation and are fined, but what are the major consequences of a civil offense besides paying a fine since it's not a misdemeanor or anything?      Also would that mean I can get caught toking up as much as I want and not have to worry about anything but paying a fine?      Just what are the major differences between a civil and criminal offense regarding marijuana, besides that you can't be put in jail?      I've never been cited for it, I'm just wondering what would happen if I were.      And I don't want to hear anything about marijuana being bad for me. If I wanted your answers about marijuana being bad I would have asked 'Should I smoke pot?'. I smoke it, I like it, and I have many major accomplishments most people only dream of despite doing it.

I am wondering because people when talking about the death Penalty (which I personally am against) they talk about how sometimes, though it has been rare if the wrong person gets executed, still use it as an argument against the death penalty and then in turn talk about the validity of abortion. In that so shouldn’t that thinking also logically apply over to abortion and the people like Gianna Jesson?

20090205083524AATQbXE	Politics & Government;Immigration	The Meat Industry and illegal aliens.?	We are told the cost of meat would be very high if we get rid of the illegal aliens in the meat processing plants.  Is that true?        Meat industry: Sizing up how labor affects meat prices       http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article...       How much more would consumers have to pay for meat if the United States deported all illegal immigrants and clamped down on the flow of legal immigrants?      Probably a few percentage points, experts say.      Immigration critics have called for a crackdown, and they've expressed frustration when federal agents arrest illegal workers at meat plants. They've said that without immigrant labor, meatpackers would have to raise wages to attract enough U.S. citizens. That inevitably would increase food prices, but not as much as consumers might fear.      Hayenga, who studied the industry for years, noted that grocery stores routinely add about 20 percent to the wholesale price before putting their wares in the cooler. Keeping that in mind, he said, it's safe to conclude that packing-plant labor accounts for less than 10 percent of what consumers pay for their meat.      In other words, if meatpackers suddenly had to double their wages, a pound of ground beef that had sold for $3 might increase to roughly $3.30.   ================================   The folks in De Moine are the very ones who would know I would think, but I don't know.  Is it correct?
20090205084104AA4n3ug	Politics & Government;Immigration	Should anyone trust the Democratic Leadership on the matter of immigraton?	Trust Teddy Kennedy, again?   Posted: June 16, 2007   1:00 a.m. Eastern       http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.as...       Sen. Kennedy Then and Now        In 1965, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization. He ushered through the Senate the immigration policy of President Lyndon B. Johnson, stating Feb. 10, 1965:   "I want to comment on ... what the bill will not do. First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same. ... Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset. ... Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [this bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area. ..."       "Thirdly, the bill will not permit the entry of subversive persons, criminals, illiterates or those with contagious disease. ... As I noted a moment ago, no immigrant visa will be issued to a person who is likely to become a public charge. ..."      Some remember Teddy Kennedy's promise regarding the 1986 amnesty bill: "This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forth an amnesty bill like this."      Kennedy now states regarding his current Kyl-Kennedy immigration bill: "Year after year we've had borders that aren't secure and a system that is broken. ... Well, now it is time for action -- 2007 is the year we must fix our broken system. ... I've been around here long enough to know that opportunities like this don't come often."    ================================      I no longer believe the Democratic Party is objective about this issue.  They took the White House away from the Bush people, and boy am I glad they did.  But they seem to be hide bound to the Mexican Government Lobby Groups.        Can we trust the Democratic Leadership on the Matter of Immigration?

20090205074934AAhvspH	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you understand this Democrat PORK plan proposed the rise in interest rates will outbalance any possitive?	The Stimulus plan under GWB bought stock and gave guarantees, so we got something for the money and a chance at an actual profit as all of those types of situations have made us money in the past.      The Nearly $1,000,000,000,000 PORK BILL the democrats have tossed at their friends and toadies in thanks for cheating the election for them, will do little to stimulate the economy and all of the money will have to be borrowed and we will own nothing in return. Quite a different situation. The democrats are willing to trade our economy to pay off big supporters. Kind of how it works in communist countries with the ruling class and their friends keeping control of all the money, taking all the others have so they can live in luxury.       No one who is not part of the governments friends will have a chance at a decent life when they have consolidated power. THEY will be rich, and the rest poor, and I'm talking about YOU or most of you, democrats and republicans alike.       You will look back on these days and despair.

After counting dozens of cars, the number is roughly 75% for pro-Obama cars being foreign made.   In contrast, the McCain supporters are around 90% for driving US made cars.  My point here is that the Obama people are arrogant if they think the fence sitters will swoon all over Obama because their foreign made car has an Obama sticker…       I am a veteran and I have served in Iraq.  Obama’s first month is not even over yet and he is funding abortions overseas.  Obama is bankrupting my grandchildren who are not even born yet.  He has nominated people who are so important that they don’t have to pay taxes, yet he criticizes corporate salaries.

President Barack Obama will make changes Thursday to President Bush's controversial Office of Faith-Based Initiatives, partly to ensure religious groups that receive government money do not discriminate in hiring, administration officials said.      Obama found that one of the problems with the previous Initiative was that tough questions were decided without appropriate consideration, data, and input from different sides, the officials said. There were ideological decisions, instead of decisions based in fact, they added.         Obama officials say his executive order will make religious groups demonstrate to the government that their hiring is legal and non-discriminatory.

20090205065154AAkiM6T	Politics & Government;Elections	Are you willing to take 500 or 1000 from our children's social security benifits?	The stimulus plan is the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s early agenda, and it also seeks to make good on some of his signature campaign promises, including an income tax cut for most Americans earning less than $200,000 a year. Under the plan, individuals would receive up to $500 and families up to $1,000 through a cut in payroll taxes on the first $8,100 in income. The money would be delivered through paychecks as a reduction in Social Security withholdings, and is intended to bolster consumer spending by giving a small lift to household pocketbooks.

20090205070206AAbVDuN	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do you feel about the financial bail out. Read below and respond.?	I agree with the POTUS, we have to act accordingly and swiftly. The scenario is overly obvious, the distribution of bail out funds given to the financial arms of this nation is not in use to bring about change and the ways that business was being conducted, rather these funds have been put into play to strengthen their immediate fiscal need. If you look further at the situation, a good business would prefer repayment of principle in times of crisis over profit. We are not seeing this with these companies, we are not seeing the high interest charges fall in order to bring payments back in line, thus continuing suffrage throughout the nation at the worse time in history.       Furthermore if your Senator or Rep. in Congress is not acting in the best interest of the people in your state, we have something in the US that says we can have them recalled back home and replaced. So those members of Congress and the Senate who continue to drag their feet, beware your state has eyes and they are watching you.

20090205070425AAlzOqy	Politics & Government;Elections	Why did people get offended when I asked why Christianity was more often associated with Republicans?	My argument was that this doesn't make sense, because Jesus was a hippie, liberal, pot-smoking socialist and people thought that I was insulting Him and decided to report my question. I don't get it!         "Jesus taught his disciples by the example of his life. His faith consisted of depending totally on God to provide all needs, food and shelter for the body, grace for the soul. He got by with a little help from his friends. He went into the wilderness, followed by thousands of people, and took no food with him, yet no one went hungry (Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14). When he was hungry, he looked to what was at hand (Mark 2:23), and he didn't worry about social conventions in eating it, such as not preparing food on the Sabbath (Mark 2:24) or washing up before eating (Matthew 15:1-2). He would dine with people thought to be sinners, taking no worry about his reputation or resume (Mark 2:15-17). He went where he felt called, when he felt called. He wasn't tied down by daily concerns."      "When Jesus sat down on the mountain to teach and explain his faith, he taught against the crushing anxiety that gives people cause to compete with one another for the resources of the earth. He taught against the fear for our lives that makes us hate one another. He taught against the striving and the ambition which prevent us from seeing what is truly present here among us already. He taught us to forget about tomorrow, to let today's trouble's alone concern us. The same applies to the moment you live in, every moment. He teaches us to be concerned about our lives NOW, about our relationships NOW. That is the true meaning of his teachings about the kingdom of God and it's righteousness. When we seek it, we find that it is close at hand indeed."      "Your garden-variety complaint against hippies is that they are "dirty". People complain that they don't wash, shave, or pay attention to their appearance. However, Jesus certainly wasn't known for his cleanliness. He was criticized for not observing purity laws. He was criticized because his disciples did not observe the common religious fasting for the sake of purity. In the presence of Christ (and remember, wherever two or three are gathered in His name, He is there) there is no need for such fasting and concern for purity. As Jesus said, in response to the shocked Pharisee:      "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? So give for alms those things that are within; and see, everything will be clean for you. -- Luke 11:39-40"      It is the gift of God, present in the giving of thanks, in the sharing of love, in the fellowship of resources shared, that cleanses. Neither washing, nor rituals of purity, nor abstaining from certain foods or drink, nor wearing of special clothing, can bring godliness. People who are so concerned about "looking right", about dressing "properly", about "decorum" and the like, have not understood that God's presence is not known or seen in such things, but that the inward love of the soul makes all things clean for us.

Under contract, the gym deducted an allocated amount per month from his bank account which paid for a certain # of sessions. Out of the blue, the owner of the gym closed the location  and sent a letter to the members requesting that they join another location (same gym) but with a different owner.  The first owner gave members about a 2 week heads up on this transition and then the gym closed.  Meanwhile, my fiancee had already prepaid $750.00 for his sessions with his trainer.  However, he discovered that his trainer would not be re-locating to the new location.  My fiancee called several times to find out if he would be refunded for the training sessions and each time the gym staff members have refused to give him an answer and became hostile when he asked for either owner's contact information.  They also informed him that he could transfer his training sessions with one of their current employees (who we discoverd is not a certified trainer) and therefore they will not have to refund his money.   Additionally, when I called and asked for the owner's contact information, the staff member became incredibly hostile towards me, refusing to comply and then abruptly hung up on me.  We are preparing to complain to the Better Business Bureau and the State Attorney's Office.  What else can we do and who else can we inform about this?  Thanks in advance for any help in this!

Dear All,      I was arrested and charged by wounding. I am anxious and I am so regret.   It was happened on the New Year eve 2008 (Jan 1st mid night).    That day I drank a lot and my mind wasn't really clear. People are pushing because there was so crowded, and I accidentally have pushed a girl in front of me and then she turned around and talk to me. And then I was like what, then I hit the girl on the road. I am so regretted and I am sure I am affected by the Alcohol, not really did that intentionally. I broke her nose and started to bleed. I know I have to take my responsibility and I am so heartfelt sorry to her. I just want she and her parent to forgive me and beg them to give me a chance for this time, and I promise I wont drink anymore. I am so regret. I am willing to pay her all the medical expenses that she and her family might have spent.   Can you please assist me on how to write a good apology letter which can move the person I hit and her family?   Thanks very much and I appreciate.    Please Pray for me.      Anxious person. Bread.
20090205073836AANZ1bl	Politics & Government;Politics	Who is using the "Politics of Fear" now?	"This recession might linger for years. Our economy will lose 5 million more jobs. Unemployment will approach double digits. Our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse," Obama wrote in the newspaper piece titled, "The Action Americans Need."   All this to get this "stimulus" bill passed in a hurry.  I believe that he knows that the more people look at this flawed piece of legislation, the less they would support it.  Do you think there is too much pork in this bill?  Do you see imminent doom if it is not passed?

20090205084137AAz9sk1	Politics & Government;Elections	Barack Obama socialist?	Barack Obama wasn't kidding when he said he'd spread the wealth around! Today the president announced that executive compensation at companies receiving substantial government bailout funds would be capped at $500,000.      This is a terrible idea, because first: socialism. It is a proud American tradition to pay executives obscene amounts of money, because that is what the market will bear. And if you try to tinker with the market, for example by attaching preconditions to executive salaries, you're dabbling in social engineering and class warfare, and the next thing you know kids will be reciting Das Kapital in elementary school rather than the pledge of allegiance.      Second, everybody knows that money attracts talent; thus, the higher the salary, the more talent you attract. Many Wall Street CEOs and bank executives earn literally tens of millions of dollars a year, and most of them have proved to be pretty awful at their jobs. So if those massive salaries can't attract a minimum level of competence, just imagine what losers who will work for a mere $500,000 a year! Does President Obama want our troubled financial sector to be led by a herd of drooling dummies who can't even keep their shoes tied? Because he's sure acting like it!

The liberals Dear Leader has passed SCHIP and to pay for it he is raising taxes on cigarettes. Of course the non thinking liberals will say "GOOD, **** THOSE SMOKERS".       http://smoking.info2you.net/?p=30       But, as this article shows, blacks and the poor make up the highest percentage of smokers.      So why is it that B. Hussein wants to raise taxes on the poor and blacks? Didn't he say during the campaign that if you make less than $250,000 a year, you wont' see your taxes go up one bit? Didn't he make that claim? Well, looks like he broke that promise, because if you make less than $250,000 a year and you smoke, your taxes just went up. OOOOOOPSSSS!      Now, I am sure the leftwing loons will say, this is good because the high taxes will act as a deterrent to smoking. Which then begs the question, if people quit smoking, then where will the money come from to pay for SCHIP?      I mean if you really want to fund healthcare for the chillen, then shouldn't you be encouraging people to smoke as much as possible? I think as a companion rule, B. Hussein should make it mandatory to smoke in public spaces including airplanes. FOR THE CHILDREN

The End of the Financial World as We Know It   By MICHAEL LEWIS and DAVID EINHORN   Published: January 3, 2009       AMERICANS enter the New Year in a strange new role: financial lunatics. We’ve been viewed by the wider world with mistrust and suspicion on other matters, but on the subject of money even our harshest critics have been inclined to believe that we knew what we were doing. They watched our investment bankers and emulated them: for a long time now half the planet’s college graduates seemed to want nothing more out of life than a job on Wall Street.      This is one reason the collapse of our financial system has inspired not merely a national but a global crisis of confidence.

No district in the state would stand to benefit as much as MPS. In addition to the construction money, the district would get $115.5 million for special education and low income students over two years, according to detailed projections developed by congressional staffers.

Questions like this have been asked before and those against governement supported health care just accused those who didn't have health insurance as lazy losers.  But with the economy crashing, the scenario has changed.  If you aren't employed anymore and have no income and little savings, what are you doing for health insurance?

The China Containment Policy is a current political belief that U.S. foreign policy strives to diminish the economic and political growth of the People’s Republic of China. The term, which primarily originates from political analysts in China, harks of the U.S. containment policy against the former Soviet Union during the Cold War.
20090205090138AAc6Yzi	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this really what is happening per one headline:  "Obama losing the stimulus message war "?	Yahoo News   At this crucial juncture in the push to pass an economic recovery package, President Obama finds himself in the most unlikely of places: He is losing the message war.    Despite Obama’s sky high personal approval ratings, polls show support has declined for his stimulus bill since Republicans and their conservative talk-radio allies began railing against what they labeled as pork barrel spending within it.    The sheer size of it – hovering at about $900 billion — has prompted more protests that are now causing some moderate and conservative Democrats to flinch and, worse, hesitate.    The anxiety over lost momentum seemed almost palpable this week as the president in television interviews voiced frustration with his White House’s progress and the way his recovery program was being demonized as a Democratic spending frenzy.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   (There is more to the article but this is enough to give you an idea of the rest of it)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     I want a leader. I don't want someone who will cave in to pressures of "the other side". I don't want a leader who will ~~this early in the game at least ~~ reach out to his First Lady and Vice President to deliver a message that he'd already delivered. I don't want a president who repeats himself incessantly trying to explain his position.     I've an idea.    President Obama. Please stay off of the tv screen and making yourself available for 'interviews' everytime someone asks you. Stick to your original plans. To me ~~and just to Me ~~ right now you seem to be weaklening. You are trying to please too many people at one time.   Stop. Re-assess.    Everyone doesn't listen to the radio~~or watch TV~~or even care. They are too busy trying to survive in these very difficult and sad economic times.       After all, the "people"  are your job ;   not the media.

Every month he provides at least $400 to give his child's mother for child care when she is away at work. I told him that he shouldn't even have to be obliged to do such a thing because, she was the one who decided to separate.    They live about 2 hours from each other, therefore because she chooses to be on her own, she'd be responsible for her daughter where she lives, and that he's to do the same when his daughter is with him.    Because he shells out this type of money, he told her that he would claim the expenses for his taxes. She got angry and was quick to say that "Then I'm going to sue you for child support."    I feel awful about everything going on to him. He served in the Navy, and within a month of their meeting at a club she got pregnant, (I think she was looking for financial compensation, if you know what I mean) He left on honorable discharge. He got a job but lost it, got his car repo'ed because he couldn't afford payments on it. Now he's hit with a threat from his ex.       Would she still be able to pin child support on him, even if it wasnt his choice to leave her in the first place, and though he is currently unemployed?       Is there anything he can do to be proactive before things get to be an actual legal matter?       Serious answers only, please.

Do you remember the story about two women who had a baby at the same time and the one mother was careless and suffocated her baby somehow. So she stole the other woman's child and the other woman figured it out (obviously). So they took it to the King and since he had no idea, and the women couldn't agree he just said the child should be cut in two and they can both have a half. So the one who was really the mother backed off immediately and said that the other woman could have her child simply so it could live. I thought that was a great idea because it shows who really loves the child and who doesn't. Obviously it wouldn't work for long once people figured out that their child wouldn't really be cut in two, but the principle is great for all these stupid mothers out there who only keep the fathers away for revenge. Don't you think?

My husband recently found some old emails in an old inbox of mine (with my permission but I didn't know the emails were there) from the guy. They are over a year old. He wrote the guy back telling him to "stay away and if I ever see you you'd better pray to your god because there would be no holding me back." He didn't say anything about what he would actually do to him (no threat of death or even beating him up) as far as what the words imply, that could be anything. Can he get into trouble?
20090205090941AAJRDab	Politics & Government;Government	Can I qualify for welfare? I have a house with mortgage payment.?	I've just lost my restaurant business due to recent economy. I have no money to tie me over until I get a job. I have a 10 year old and 2 mortgages, 1st & 2nd, with no equity. Right now my house is worth less than what I owe to banks so if I were to sell, I would owe banks a lot of money and I don't have that. My total mortgage amount is about the same as renting a 2 bedroom apartment where I am, so it will actually cost more money to sell than to stay. Can I still qualify for assistance for food, cash, and utilities?

The pageant was originally set for January 2008. The pageant was continually postponed. I signed a contract and payed my dues andt he contract stated the pageant would be held on December the 6th 2008. The contracted also did state that there would be no refunds. But the contract that I signed said it would be held December the 6th. The pageant was again reset another 9 times jumping from date to date. She then decided to set it for January 10th in which I had reset plans and could not attend. I asked for my money back and she refused.     My question is.. I filed a small claims court case against her. I did sign a contract with her but the contract I signed was for a pageant that was supposed to be held on December 6th. Would the contract still stand in her favor being She changed the Date? Or will I have a case because of the reset and be able to recieve my money back? I don't know the legalities a contract stands being that she changed the date??? Thank you so much for your help.

20090205080641AAxu67h	Politics & Government;Politics	Pubs in the UK are in decline...What is the biggest factor..the recession or the smoking ban?	The decline in pub takings, and people drinking more at home, for me started with the smoking ban. Then came the so called "credit crunch", (It took the politicians 6 months to admit it was a recession).   Now I don't go to pubs much, but when I do they are not as busy as they should be. A lot of people have complained about ciggy butts outside pubs and other buildings in our area because of the ban. My opinion is that smoking should have been up to the Landlord, with warning notices outside, that you were entering a "smoking environment". There should have been NO smoking in the bar area, but as in the "old" days, when there was a smoking lounge. As in the words of one action group "Them that brought in this ban , don't do pubs".   I don't mind people smoking in pubs..let them kill themselves..but when we start to lose a piece of BRITISH heritage..then the politicians and do-gooders (who are in a minority) want to be told to shut up!   Now the country has hit the recession, we will pull out of that..shame when a few hundred pubs have closed never to re-open..

My MOS will be Combat Arms so I imagine ill be at SOI a little longer.

Please I would like to here from people who have or know someone with experience. I would also like to here from an EX Marine, how long does your training stick with you?      Thanks for the help.
20090205083722AAlUtZW	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it too early to shop and prepare?	My fiance has been cut out of his daughter's life since she was born. He has filed for parental rights and has a paternity test in the process. There is no valid reason for why the mother has kept him away except out of spite. She is immature and has no business having any children. She thinks that all she has to do is refuse the test and file for child support and my fiance will back off. It isn't like that. She can't refuse the test for long because if she does her state aid will be cut off (we did it through child support) so she will have no way to go to the doctor or collect WIC benefits. She doesn't make much money and she is pregnant again so she needs to go to the doctor. Once the test is complete then my fiance has every right to seek rights to his daughter, and I can't see him being denied at least visitation as long as he pays child support. So does it seem like everything will work out for us? I really can't wait to go shopping and get toys for her and pick out a bed set and clothes and all sorts of things to welcome her into our home. The court date is April 3rd. Should I just wait until after that, or do we have things fairly guaranteed?

20090205081916AATrMzC	Politics & Government;Military	Re-enlisting Dilema.  Please Help?	I have recently decided to re-enlist in the Army.  I am prior Army reserve (1986 - 1991).  I wanted to rejoin Army full time and have spoken to a recruiter about it and it seems like something I would love to do.       There are a couple things that I think may be a problem with just up and leaving/being stationed.      1).  I have a home and in this market, I'm not sure I can sell it right away.   2). My daughter will be 18 in 3 months, but she depends on me solely.  She is starting school In Sept 2009 (College) but she will be close to home.  She is willing to live with a relative or even try on her own, but I don't think signing up full time for Army now would be a good idea if I have to boot her out right away.  Helping her get settled and prepared for living alone is probably better.      My question is, what is the benefit of just doing the Army Reserves now and then going full time?        How long are the 'terms' of joining?  2 years?  4 years?  Etc?      I was told that there are no bonus' or incentives for people re-enlisting after being out for a while.  The recruiter told me they couldnt give me an idea of that (If its a possibility) and I couldn't find out about it until I was actually at the MEPS center.  Is that true?      Thanks for all your responses, they have been really helpful in the past.

20090205082505AACdkke	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Anyone know anything about no contact laws? Please help... i'm desperate.?	Me and my boyfriend, I don't even know if i'm legally allowed to call him that anymore, got in some trouble with the law in the beginning of december. We were caught performing sexual acts in a vehicle in a park near my house, i'm 16, he's 19. He means the world to me, and although I was in a lot of trouble afterwards, we continued our relationship and waited to hear if he'd have to go to court. He did, court was yesterday, and when I tried to call him and ask how it went, all he said was "I cannot talk to you, and the only way I can talk to you is to tell you that I can't talk to you." I nearly died, realizing that neither of us wishes to comply with this bullsh*t rule. He will go to jail if we are caught speaking or having any contact whatsoever. I care about him deeply. What can I do?
20090205083007AA6GweL	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	If you never smoke pot.....?	But did it 4 times, each 2 weeks apart.  Does this still count as an occasional smoker and when will it leave your system.  And lets say the amount is 2 hits.  Me and my hubby are having a "discussion" about this.  I say 30 days til gone he says up to 3 days or a week cause it is so little and on occasion.     I think that because it is every two weeks you are not letting your system be clean and it just keeps building up?
