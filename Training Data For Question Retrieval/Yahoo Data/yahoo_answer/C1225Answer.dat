77af9dfbcad746672b88d19627087b3aaa	1. I know that time is different for ghosts then for us, but do they know when there anniversary of death is and is it important to them?    yes they know, and usually no.. it's not important to them as it might be to ones left behind.        2. Are EVP sessions more successful on anniversaries?  No. not really.        3. Would playing the slide show from the funeral attract my loved one? He died in another state from where I live.    ....you took slides of a funeral!?....hhmmm....ok.  anyway... i doubt that would "attract" your loved one.  I would more sugest laying the person's favourite music, having their favourite meal, snacks, do thing that they enjoyed, and TALK to them!  that attracts like no tomorrow...    but don't be disappointed if you don't get a reaction. Not everyone is "stuck" here.  Your loved one may have moved on... but that's a good thing.    good luck!|`|eibO5ax3aa	An earthbound is aware of birthdays, anniversaries, etc., but it is not of any significance to them once they transition. EVP sessions are not necessarily more successful on anniversaries. Think about and converse with your loved one who has crossed over. That's really all you need to do. Earthbounds are not bound by the laws of geography, gravity, physics, and they will hear you. If you pay attention, they will communicate. Many visit while you are dreaming, while others will move things, play around with electrical appliances/lights, take your keys, etc.    Once an individual has passed, they are capable of so much more than they were in life. The only hitch is that they tend not to reveal themselves if you are heavily grieving. It's difficult enough for them to see you in pain, and they are hesitant to contribute to it.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You have asked some interesting questions here.  Do humans survive their physical bodies as distinct, sentient beings?  If they do are they able to physically communicate with those still living?  Do they recognize our time structure?  Nobody knows the answers to any of these questions.  Some would say the answers are unknowable.  So regard with suspicion anyone pretending to know the answers.  Anyone who answers such questions with confidence is likely to be lying, delusional, confused or, to give the benefit of the doubt, just giving unreal authority to far-flung speculation.|`|YIy9yu4qaa	My question is, what exactly are you looking to gain from this endeavor?   Do you want proof of something paranormal or closure?  Just because someone is dead, doesn't mean they are a ghost roaming around. I know popular fiction seems to indicate otherwise, but keep in mind, fiction is not real.  Plus place and time of death or burial does not really have to do with a haunting. Abraham Lincolns ghost, for example, is supposed to haunt the white house, and he neither died nor was buried there.|`|kO6nOtuEaa	Time is not happening after you pass. some don't realize there even gone. you can try the EVP session with the slide there are no guarantee's you really have to be around the place they have departed.

No one knows the truth in them.     If you just miss him and want to talk to him, just do it. It is good for your soul to get what ever it is you want to say off your chest.    If you believe your loved one still lingers you can try an evp session.  As for me I  would just talk to them as they were there and let the answers be answered in my own mind..Sometimes the truth is best left unknown in some situations.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	Just give it a try. Who knows?
SvmZlLdaaa	The main reason is that canids just aren't equipped to make a kill the way felids do. A cat has claws that are kept sharp by being retractile, meaning they can cling on onto their prey, and large canine teeth set in powerful, shortened jaws. They are ambush predators, meaning they creep up on their prey and take it by surprise, in contrast to most canids which run their prey down by superior stamina. This means felids can be more powerfully built, and are strong enough to pull their prey down and kill it before beginning to feed. Canids, on the other hand, must be leaner and lighter in order to maintain a long chase - too much muscle would slow them down. When they catch their prey, their only option is to seize it with their jaws, since their claws are non-retractile and blunt from constant contact with the ground. They are not strong enough to do this alone, unlike cats, and the safest option is to simply tear the prey to pieces (disembowelling an animal as canids such as African wild dogs often do can actually lead to a quicker death than the suffocation method employed by big cats).    Also, most canids hunt in groups, whereas most cats hunt alone. If you have to compete with several others for your food, it makes sense to begin eating as quickly as possible, i.e. as soon as you've got your teeth into your prey. A lone felid can take its time, knowing it has no competition - though cheetahs, which often lose their kills to larger predators like lions or hyenas, do eat more quickly than other cats in case their prey is taken from them. They do kill it first, though.    By the way, you don't need to worry about being eaten alive by wolves (not unless you happen to run into a rabid pack, that is). There is no record of a healthy wolf ever attacking a human. All reports of 'wolf attacks', when investigated, have proved to be attacks by feral dogs, wolf-dog hybrids, or rabid wolves.    In response to tiger b's answer, I'd like to point out that lions are not 'mostly scavengers'. Like almost all predators, they will scavenge when the opportunity arises - it makes sense to eat something you haven't had to expend any energy catching - but the majority of their food comes from animals they have killed themselves. Big cats also don't 'like to let their food rot'. Again like most predators, they will happily eat meat that has begun to decay, but they don't deliberately leave it to rot before eating it. They begin eating what they've killed straight away. In the case of cheetahs, for example, if they left their food to start rotting before eating it they would lose it to larger predators.|`|aY40cuPZaa	i would rather be a snake.|`|a9da82d7c02f0d0c2e3f006a101c69c4aa	In part it depends on size of prey and size of predator and how they hunt.      Big cats usually are solitary hunters (the exception are lions and they are actually mostly scavengers) and to capture a prey they must do their best and that means killing it.  Big cats (especially tigers) also like to let their food rot before eating it.  They will return to a feed site multiple times and feed on the same carcass (a female with it's cubs).    Wolves and dogs are pack hunters.  They must always divide the food and it's an all out war to get the best chunks before another gets them first.  They eat all the food available and the young (like in lions) only get what's leftover.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	You probably have not seen enough films then. I can tell you that big cats can begin to eat their food before it is dead - especially lions where there are multiple animals trying to get their share as quickly as possible.

c511575866d062562bfb645d4ee5d618aa	11032    Since 27 is odd, there must be an odd number of 3-step jumps.  Let N be this number.    N=9  There is one way to do this.  9*3 = 27    N=7  7*3, 3*2  There are 10 jumps altogether.  7 of them are 3-steps.  There are C(10,7) = 120 ways to do this.  or  7*3, 1*2, 1*4  There are 9 jumps altogether. There are C(9,7) = 36 ways to choose which are the 3-steps.  Then there are C(2,1)=2 ways to pick which of the 2 remaining jumps is the 2-step and which is the 4-step.  So there are 36*2 =72 ways to do this.    Following this same line of reasoning,   N=5  5*3, 6*2  C(11,5)=462  or  5*3, 4*2, 1*4  C(10,5) * C(5,1) = 1260  or  5*3, 2*2, 2*4  C(9,5) * C(4,2) = 756  or  5*3, 3*4  C(8,5) = 56    N=3  C(12,3) = 220  C(11,3) * C(8,1) = 1320  C(10,3) * C(7,2) = 2520  C(9,3) * C(6,3) = 1680  C(8,3) * C(5,4) = 280    N=1  C(13,1) = 13  C(12,1) * C(11,1) = 132  C(11,1) * C(10,2) = 495  C(10,1) * C(9,3) = 840  C(9,1) * C(8,4) = 630  C(8,1) * C(7,5) = 168  C(7,1) = 7    Adding all these together yields 11032

A "statistic" is an expression derived from the sample variables.  The average age in the sample is a statistic.

gpNF2Ocsaa	It involves information passing from an axon, through the synapse to a dendrite via action potentials and neurotransmitters:    Neurons have specialized projections called dendrites and axons. Dendrites bring information to the cell body and axons take information away from the cell body.  Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse. The synapse contains a small gap separating neurons. The synapse consists of:    1. a presynaptic ending that contains neurotransmitters, mitochondria and other cell organelles,  2. a postsynaptic ending that contains receptor sites for neurotransmitters and,  3. a synaptic cleft or space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic endings.

8oCwrIR2aa	The angle is 70 degrees.    Call the angle you need "z" and then you have:    x + z = 90  y + z = 180    You also know that x + y + z = 200. If you substitute x + y = 90 for the x + y in that, you get: y + 90 = 200 which resolves to y = 110.    Then put that y + z = 180 to find z = 70.    You don't need to learn what "x" is (it's 20 degrees). Of course, you could have substituted 180 for y + z to get x + 180 = 200 and x = 20 and found "z" that route. Then you wouldn't've needed to learn the measure of "y"  most things can be done more than one way.
GfCsOZOLaa	polarity is basically if a molecule has a distinct positive and negative end.    The way you get that positive and negative is by how closely each atom in a molecule holds the electrons to itself.    For example, O will hold electrons closer than H because it is larger (has more protons) and there for the attraction between the electrons and protons is greater.    This is why H2O is polar.    nonpolar: oil.    Also, any diatomic element is nonopolar (O2, Br2, etc.)  because even though they are bonded, they are the same atom so one cannot hold electrons closer to itself.|`|IlndnVyBaa	You see, atoms are made of a positively charged nucleus    and negatively charge electrons revolving around the nucleus    When atoms are bonded to different atoms on different sides the amount of time they orbit around each atoms is changed and this gives the atom a little more negative charge where the electrons stay longer    and positive charge where the electrons stay less longer.    Like in water that is the case.    Non polar molecules have evenly distributed charge.    Non polar things dissolve only in non polar things while polar things dissolve only in polar things.  This is why oil does not dissolve in water since water is polar and oil is non polar|`|lhYIk8b2aa	A polar molecule, such as water, has a slightly positive charge on one side, and a slightly negative charge on the other.    In water, the hydrogen atoms are not separated by a 180 degree angle, and due to the nature of the bond, they are slightly positively charge, while the oxygen atom is slightly negatively charged.    With a non-polar molecule, such as CO2, the atoms carry no charge since the electrons are distributed more evenly, or any charges are equally balanced, such as in methane.|`|OSqQZwGYaa	A polar molecule is like water (H2O), where it has a dipole moment, meaning the distribution are not equally shared, and also since oxygen is more electronegative, and has a molecular geometry of bent, while methane is a non-polar molecule since all the charges cancel each other out (CH4)  for more information visit wikipedia

cKzfxE0Zaa	When the sun becomes a red giant it will expand to become 0.85 AU in radius and have a surface temperature of about 2400K. It's luminosity then will be 1000 times what it is now. Since the distance at which subsolar temperature is constant depends on the square root of the luminosity, the only semi-decent place to be while the sun is a red giant will be Neptune's largest moon, Triton. The moons of Jupiter and Saturn will also bake in the heat from the swollen sun.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	I gather from this information, that the final expansion size will be 1.75 A.U.  That would be 1.75 X 93 million miles out from the current surface of the Sun.  None of the inner planets, including Mars, will be within the habitable zone.  Perhaps Neptune, Pluto, or Eris could one day be colonized, after the Sun begins its expansion and the habitable zone starts moving outward.  There will be another 5 billion years before it finishes expanding.    "Billions of years in the future, when our Sun bloats up into a red giant, it will expand to consume the Earth's orbit.    When the sun becomes a red giant, the simple calculation would put its equator out past Mars. All of the inner planets would be consumed.  However, as the Sun reaches this late stage in its stellar evolution, it loses a tremendous amount of mass through powerful stellar winds. As it grows, it loses mass, causing the planets to spiral outwards. So the question is, will the expanding Sun overtake the planets spiraling outwards, or will Earth (and maybe even Venus) escape its grasp.    K.-P Schroder and Robert Cannon Smith are two researchers trying to get to the bottom of this question. They've run the calculations with the most current models of stellar evolution, and published a research paper entitled, Distant Future of the Sun and Earth Revisited.  According to Schroder and Smith, when the Sun becomes a red giant star 7.59 billion years, it will start to lose mass quickly. By the time it reaches its largest radius, 256 times its current size, it will be down to only 67% of its current mass.    When the Sun does begin to bloat up, it will go quickly, sweeping through the inner Solar System in just 5 million years. It will then enter its relatively brief (130 million year) helium-burning phase. It will expand past the orbit of Mercury, and then Venus. By the time it approaches the Earth, it will be losing 4.9 x 1020 tonnes of mass every year (8% the mass of the Earth).    But the habitable zone will be gone much sooner. Astronomers estimate that will expand past the Earth's orbit in just a billion years. The heating Sun will evaporate the Earth's oceans away, and then solar radiation will blast away the hydrogen from the water. The Earth will never have oceans again. It will eventually become molten again.  One interesting side benefit for the Solar System. Even though the Earth, at a mere 1.5 astronomical units, will no longer be within the Sun's habitable zone, much of the Solar System will be. The new habitable zone will stretch from 49.4 AU to 71.4 AU, well into the Kuiper Belt. The formerly icy worlds will melt, and liquid water will be present beyond the orbit of Pluto. Perhaps Eris will be the new homeworld.    Back to the question will the Earth survive?  According to Schroder and Smith, the answer is no. Even though the Earth could expand to an orbit 50% larger than today's orbit, it won't get the chance. The expanding Sun will engulf the Earth just before it reaches the tip of the red giant phase. And the Sun would still have another 0.25 AU and 500,000 years to grow."|`|2xpzhN5faa	I've been told that Mars is on the "doomed list" :)|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Mars will not be engulfed by the expansion of the Sun into a red giant, but it will be engulfed by the outer layers of the Sun when they are blown off in a planetary nebula, a short time later.  After that, the Sun will be a white dwarf and the solar system will not be a pleasant place to live.  So, interstellar travel will be necessary.    It's certain that this will not be a problem for "humans".  Our species is only a few million years old---the 4.5 billion years before the Sun dies is enough time for all life on earth to be wiped out and civilization re-emerge twice.  Even if we survive our decendents will be nothing like us in a few million years.

The first phase will see it become an orange giant as the Sun leaves the main-sequence and enters the asymptotic giant branch (of the H-R diagram). This happens when the core runs out of hydrogen in around 4Gyrs.     The orange giant is believed to engulf the orbit of Mercury and drive much of the atmosphere and oceans from Earth. As the Sun expands into the orange giant it'll cool and start contracting again. He fusing will occur, expanding the Sun again. The Sun will become a red giant.     It is thought this will happen twice (expansion and then contraction). It'll certainly engulf the orbit of Venus, and destroy the surface of Earth, but it is likely to not quite engulf Earth's orbit. Note that it'll lose a lot of mass, spiralling the planets outward; it is hard to say with certainty exactly what'll end up where.     Jupiter and Saturn are likely to have shrunk in size (particularly Saturn) as their atmospheres are stripped by the very strong solar wind. Saturn's rings are likely to be destroyed (if they have lasted that long). It is possible that the Oort cloud objects could be disrupted by the increased heat and enter the Solar System impacting some planets.     Basically, if we've stuck around on Earth we're screwed.|`|4RJKl1aKaa	The current estimates are that the Sun will expand to somewhere between the current Earth and Mars orbits.  However the Sun is slowly getting lighter as a result of nuclear reactions and the solar wind and so the planets are slowly being released into larger orbits.  The result is that both the Earth and Mars are expected to escape being engulfed by the Sun, although the Earth will be scorched and no longer habitable.

GfCsOZOLaa	Convex lenses are thicker in the middle then the edges and concave are thicker at the edges then the middle. When light travels through lenses, refraction occurs. The light bends either outward or inward, it depends on the lens.    The lens of your eye is a double convex lens. Its job is to focus the image on the retina of the eye. If one is farsighted, the lens in the eye causes the focus to be behind the retina. These people see far but have some difficultly seeing close-up. The lens focuses behind the retina because the actual eyeball is too short from front to back. To correct this farsightedness, the person would wear glasses or contacts with convex lenses.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Concave lense shows even small thing as bigger and so it can show only a little quantity.Covex lens shows bigger things also as small and so can show larger quantity.|`|uOqk7PzGaa	you probably mean a "positive" lens that happens to be convex. Not sure there is a real reason as to "why" but certainly a positive lens, in this case shaped convex, is the only kind of lens that can produce a real image on the retina.    It is all evolution, the human ancestors that happened to evolve an eye, and they did not looked not even remotely like a human, evolved many types of lenses for their eyes; convex is the only shape that can produce an image and, thus, those that had this type of lens thrive as a species while those others with a different kind of lens did not survive in the long run.|`|gpNF2Ocsaa	It has to do with the properties of light and refraction. In a convex (converging) lens, parallel light is bent "inward" to a converging point, which hopefully is a functioning macula (most sensitive part of the retina)    If the lens were concave (diverging) the light would refract and scatter outward.   Check out the images in the source link and it makes a lot of sense.|`|AA10075521	For vision, the eye lens has to bend the light rays inwards to a point, which is on the retina. The rod cells have to pick these up. If a convex is used, the rays converge and meet on the retina. This is what is required and this only happens. If a concave is used, then the rays will diverge and wont meet at a point on the retina, i.e. on a rod cell or a cone cell. They meet behind the lens, in this case and a virtual image is formed.  Now the mechanism of vision is important. The light changes the structure of a compound called rhodopsin when it falls on the cell. It leads to a set of reactions and an impulse to the brain. This will happen only if the light converge.  We need a real image and not a virtual image. So, the eye has a convex lens and not a concave one.|`|PKEmkT7saa	Kindly read Section 1.1 from the following link .    This is the Grade X Text Book in India .

AA10927246	First, you need to figure out the rate that the tank drains.  It took from 9:55 am to 10:11 am to drain.  That's 16 minutes.<br>  <br>  So basically the drain will remove 1/16 of the tank per minute.<br>  <br>  Then you have two pipes that add water.  One takes 20 minutes to fill the tank, the other takes 30 minutes.  Again turning them into a rate (by inverting) you have:<br>  Pipe A fills 1/20 of the tank per minute<br>  Pipe B fills 1/30 of the tank per minute<br>  The drain removes 1/16 of the tank per minute<br>  <br>  Let M be the number of minutes until the tank is completely full (1 complete tankful):<br>  <br>  Write the equation of adding pipes A and B, but subtracting the drain.<br>  (1/20 + 1/30 - 1/16)M = 1<br>  <br>  Get a common denominator:<br>  20 = 2 x 2 x 5<br>  30 = 2 x 3 x 5<br>  16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2<br>  LCD(20,30,16) = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 240<br>  <br>  Convert the fractions:<br>  1/20 = 12/240<br>  1/30 = 8/240<br>  1/16 = 15/240<br>  <br>  Now you have everything with a common denominator.<br>  (12/240 + 8/240 - 15/240)M = 1<br>  <br>  Combine the fractions into a single fraction:<br>  [(12 + 8 - 15)/240 ] M = 1<br>  ( 5 / 240 )M = 1<br>  <br>  Reduce:<br>  ( 1 / 48 ) M = 1<br>  <br>  Multiply both sides by 48 to solve for M:<br>  M = 1 * 48<br>  M = 48 minutes<br>  <br>  Add that to the time when he started filling (12:40 pm) to get the final time on his watch.<br>  <br>  12:40 pm + 48 minutes = 1:28 pm<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  1:28 pm<br>  <br>  P.S.  I hope he finally remembers to put the plug back in or else it will be drained again 16 minutes later.  :-)|`|EXpYLOhKaa	The outflow of the tank is -(V/16)t. The inflow from pipe one is (V/20)t, the inflow from the other is (V/30)t. So the total flow is: (V/20+V/30-V/16)t=(V/48)t. So if the tank is full it has been 48 minutes and thus he got back at 1:28PM.|`|i8LIR72Taa	One fills 1/20 of the tank per minute, the other 1/30<br>  together they fill 1/20 + 1/30 = 3/60 + 2/60 of the tank per minute, or 5/60. So it takes 60/5 = 12 minutes to fill, the time is 12:40 + 0:12 = 12:52.|`|sj6QVnVgaa	V = tank volume, gal (unknown, but it doesn't matter)<br>  Drain rate D = V/16 gal/min<br>  Pipe #1 fill rate F1 = V/20 gal/min<br>  Pipe #2 fill rate F2 = V/30 gal/min<br>  <br>  to get the fill time T with all valves open, the equation is<br>  F1 + F2 - D = V/T or<br>  V/20 + V/30 - V/16 = V/T<br>  <br>  dividing both sides by V, you get <br>  <br>  1/20 + 1/30 -1/16 = 1/T<br>  <br>  Solve for T and add to the starting time to get the final time

AA11614996	Hi: <br>  <br>  five things to remember about multiplication and division <br>  <br>  1) multiplication is repeated addition or a number add so many times.<br>  <br>  for a example  6 time 8 <br>  <br>  6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6= 48 or <br>  <br>  8+8+8+8+8+8 = 48<br>  <br>  <br>  2)  division is repeated subtraction or multiplication in reverse <br>  <br>  for a example <br>  <br>  48 / 6 = 8 <br>  <br>  48-6 = 42, 42-6 = 36, 36-6= 30, 30-6= 24, 24-6= 18, 18-6= 12, 12-6 = 6 , 6-6 =0 , and if you counted the number of time you subtracted it . It was done 8 times   <br>  <br>  <br>  3) the highest single digit by single digit multiple by  multiplication  is 81 (because 9 * 9 = 81) Thus no single digit number time a single number will never exceed 81 <br>  <br>  4 ) Any multiplication by 5 will always end in a 5 or 0 <br>  <br>  5)  If in doubt about any multiplication number remember at you can add them by the multiplier by the number it is away from 5 from and add the multiplier that many times Or if it's smaller than 5 than subtract it that many time it a away from 5 ( see the example below) <br>  <br>  for example 7*8 =? <br>  <br>  and you forgot what it is <br>  <br>  Okay we know that 5*8= 40 right <br>  <br>  and 7 is two numbers away from 5 So we have to add 8 twice So <br>  <br>  40 + 8 = 48 and 48+8 = 56 therefore  7*8= 56 and 8*7 = 56 <br>  <br>  <br>  9*3 = ? <br>  <br>  you forgot it Okay <br>  <br>  we know that 9 time 5 = 45 So <br>  <br>  how big is three to five and if it less than five how far away it is from five? <br>  <br>  1) it smaller than five so we have to subtractthe 9's it from the 45 <br>  <br>  2) three is two away from five So we have to subtract 9 two time So <br>  <br>  45 - 9 = 36, 36- 9= 27 therefore 3*9= 27 or 9*3 =27 <br>  <br>  <br>  The reason I use the five table is because it's the easiest table to learn short of one and ten <br>  there are many other shortcut in Multiplication but this should get you out of any jams you might get in to <br>  <br>  Also repeating the times table over and over or sing as a song is a great to learn it too. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps
PNM9bnVOaa	The first question you are asking is the domain (what x can NOT be). When you have a fraction, the bottom part of the fraction can not be zero, so really you just have to factor x^2+4x+3. this factors out to (x+3)(x+1). SO.. x Cannot be -1 or -3 because that would make the bottom zero.

gxajLj7Eaa	If you have the equation:<br>  -the vertical shift is the number added after the cos/sin<br>  -the amplitude is the number before the cos/sin function <br>  <br>  For example, take the function F(x) = 2cosx + 3:<br>   the vertical shift would be up 3 units and the amplitude would be 2 (vertical stretch of 2). The rules are the same for any kind of graph, cosine, sine, or otherwise.  You don't need a calculator for this.  <br>  <br>  (FYI, if the x is multiplied by an integer (for example, cos(5x), that makes the graph stretched by a factor of 5 horizontally, so instead of intersecting at pi, it intersects the x axis at 5pi, 10pi, etc.  <br>  If the x is followed by an integer added to or subtracted from the variable, a horizontal shift is indicated: cos(x+2) indicates a shift two units to the left, whereas cos(x-2) indicates a shift two units to the right, which is opposite of the way you might expect it to be.  )

9lzNDwhZaa	I don't think that the advantages of nuclear power have been fully weighed up against its disadvantages.<br>  <br>  Firstly, there is the nuclear waste that needs to be disposed of. Many governments consider that a shale or clay insulated underground recepticle in a non-seismically active area to be adequate for this. Other governments, such as that of the United Kingdom, are unsure about this so that high toxicity nuclear waste remains in temporary disposal sites.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there is the need to dispose of low toxicity nuclear waste such as discarded overalls. This doesn't pose a problem.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, there is the disposal of coolant water. Nuclear power stations are generally situated close to the coast or near large rivers because they need large quantities of water for cooling purposes. If heated water, albeit non radio-active, is disposed directly back into the rivers, it can affect the animal life of the river or nearby sea.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, nuclear power plants only have a limited life after which they need to be decommissioned. Decommissioning a nuclear power plant can be a MAJOR challenge in terms of the environment.<br>  <br>  Overall, despite these drawbacks, nuclear power generation is probably better than oil or gas fired electricity generation as the uncertainties over remaining global oil reserves mean that we need not be totally dependant on hydro-carbons for our power. I do however, most prefer coal power generation in preference to nuclear as coal reserves (like uranium reserves) are also not in short supply. (Scrubbers can remove environmental pollutants from the gas effluents.)|`|lsUMe5WVaa	Nuclear power plants generate nuclear waste, which needs to be disposed of. The waste is radioactive, and takes a very long time to decay, so its not very good for the environment if it isn't contained properly.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, nuclear power is significantly cleaner than most other energy sources (coal and gas for example). It has very low emissions, and actually releases less radioactive material into the environment than several other sources (again, coal or gas are examples).<br>  <br>  As for humanity, nuclear power has the best safety record of all of the major energy sources, so the more nuclear power there is, the fewer deaths there are per yer. However, it also has the highest potential for economic disaster in the case of a meltdown (Chernobyl being an example of the worst case scenario, and not surprisingly, the most expensive human disaster in history).<br>  <br>  One benefit however, is that there is a significant amount of nuclear fuel available, so that we can easily rely on it for a few hundred years. And as technology advances (fuel efficiency), we ought to have enough fuel for a few millennia.

xz4Cf3xfaa	Adam…is right on but just to expand a little more on the subject.<br>  <br>  The temperature is very low (meaning that things would freeze); the pressure is very low (meaning that volatile things like water will evaporate). It sounds a lot like freeze-drying.<br>  <br>  A dead body in space is likely to be rapidly mummified as water is evaporated; your intestinal system is host to millions of tiny bacteria that begin to digest as soon you as you pass away. On a more elemental level, dying cells release enzymes that break down various proteins and molecules. Bacteria are likely to be killed by the freeze-drying process, so bodies would not decay in space. <br>  <br>  Contrary to some myths your eyes would not burst and your body would not explode when exposed to a total vacuum. Your body would experience internal ruptures as the pressure drops.<br>  <br>  Since water vaporizes in a vacuum, eventually your body would become entirely dried out. Your body would also be exposed to all sorts of radiation.<br>  <br>  Just the thought of your body floating through space looking like an interstellar Slim Jim is enough to give someone night sweats!|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It would dry up turn into a piece of leather and carry on like that for many years.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	If the body had no space suit on then it would explode due to the internal pressure being much greater than the very low pressure in space.

815711a008fec055cd8af233c73e548baa	No object is immoveable - as this would mean that is doesnt move under any circumstance. Anything with energy moves, and to have no energy an object would have to be at a temperature of absolute zero (-273.15 Centigrade) and the laws of thermodynamics show this to be an impossible state to achive.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you could fire antimatter at the so-called immoveable object, thus annihilating it and turning it into photons (massless packets of energy). Quantum physics states that the photons will then go on to take part in "pair production", turning into other particles with less energy. The excess energy, so as to abide by the laws of physics, turns into kinetic energy (movement energy) - the object is no longer immoveable.|`|LGkb4xibaa	i'm thinkin that if they existed and that happened, they would probably explode or make some sort of reaction.

4kEuzSpkaa	Probably not. Saturated fat usually comes from animals. Unsaturated fat usually comes from plants. There are probably some exceptions, but if your a vegan - stick to unsaturates to be on the safe side.|`|968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	In chemistry, saturation has four different meanings, none of which have anything to do with vegans.<br>  <br>  In physical chemistry, saturation is the point at which a solution of a substance can dissolve no more of that substance and additional amounts of that substance will appear as a precipitate. This point of maximum concentration, the saturation point, depends on the temperature of the liquid as well as the chemical nature of the substances involved. This can be used in the process of recrystallisation to purify a chemical: it is dissolved to the point of saturation in hot solvent, then as the solvent cools and the solubility decreases, excess solute precipitates. Impurities, being present in much lower concentration, do not saturate the solvent and so remain dissolved in the liquid. If a change in conditions (e.g. cooling) means that the concentration is actually higher than the saturation point, the solution has become supersaturated. <br>  In physical chemistry, when referring to surface processes, saturation denotes the degree of which a surface is full of something. For example, base saturation refers to the fraction of exchangeable cations that are base cations. Similarly, in environmental soil science, nitrogen saturation means that an ecosystem, such as a soil, can not store any more nitrogen. <br>  In organic chemistry, a saturated compound has the maximum amount of hydrogens possible: i.e., no double or triple bonds. In a saturated hydrocarbon chain, every carbon atom is attached to two hydrogen atoms, except carbon atoms at the ends of the chain, which are attached to three hydrogen atoms. In the case of saturated methane, four hydrogen atoms are attached to the single, central carbon atom. Of simple hydrocarbons, alkanes are saturated, and alkenes are unsaturated. The degree of unsaturation is a method of specifying the amount that a compound is partially saturated. In the modern treatment of electronic structure, unsaturated compounds are characterized by pi electron systems. The term is applied similarly to the fatty acid constituents of lipids, where the fat is described as saturated or unsaturated, depending on whether the constituent fatty acids contain carbon-carbon double bonds. Unsaturated is used when any carbon structure contains double or occasionally triple bonds. Many vegetable oils contain fatty acids with one (monounsaturated) or more (polyunsaturated) double bonds in them. <br>  In biochemistry, the term saturation refers to the fraction of total protein binding sites that are occupied at any given time.

AA10299755	Albert Einstein published two theories of relativity: Special Relativity and General Relativity.<br>  <br>  Special Relativity says that the speed of light is constant in all referencial frames even if they are moving near the speed of light, and nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This means that time and space is NOT absolute, or in other words, how fast time flows depends on how fast one is moving. This also led Einstein to the conclusion that matter and energy are euqivalent, and he described it in his most famous equation, E=MC^2.<br>  <br>  General Relativity describes gravity not as a force, but as a manifestation of curved space and time. In this theory, spacetime is treated as a 4-dimensional manifold (or in other words a 4-dimensional geometric shape) which is curved by the presence of mass, energy, and momentum (or stress-energy) within it. The motion of objects being influenced solely by the geometry of spacetime (also called inertial motion) occurs along special paths called timelike and null geodesics of spacetime. Typically, any object falling to the ground unobstructed would be following such a path, as well as any orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars. <br>  <br>  After Einstein published General Relativity, he and other physicists predicted the following based on the results of their calculations using Einstein's general relativity field equations:<br>  <br>  1. Gravitational redshifting of light: The frequency of light will decrease (shifting visible light towards the red end of the spectrum) as it moves to higher gravitational potentials (out of a gravity well). Confirmed by the Pound-Rebka experiment.<br>  <br>  2. Gravitational time dilation: Clocks will run slower at lower gravitational potentials (deeper within a gravity well). Confirmed by the Haefele-Keating experiment and GPS. <br>  <br>  3. Gravitational time delay: Signals will take longer than expected to move through a gravitational field. Confirmed through observations of signals from spacecraft and pulsars passing behind the Sun as seen from the Earth. <br>  <br>  4. Gravitational lensing: A distant object in front of another much more distant object can change how the more distant object is seen by curving the light from the more distant object. These effects include:<br>  <br>  (a) Multiple views of the same object: Observations of quasars<br>  whose light passes close to an intervening galaxy.<br>  (b) Brightening of a star due to the focusing effects of a planet<br>  or another star passing in front of it.<br>  (c) Einstein rings and arcs: One object directly behind another<br>  can make the more distant object's light appear as a ring.<br>  When almost directly behind, the result is an arc.<br>  <br>  5.

Expansion of the universe: This is predicted by cosmological solutions of the Einstein Field Equations. Its existence was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.<br>  <br>  7. Cosmological redshift: Light from distant galaxies will be redshifted due to their movement away from the observer according to Hubble's law. <br>  <br>  8. Big Bang: The arising of the universe from a primordial singularity. Confirmed by the discovery of the Cosmic microwave background radiation, the remnants of the primordial fireball. Discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965. <br>  <br>  9. Dark energy: This is an energy field of unknown composition that may exist throughout the universe. Recent observations of distant supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is currently "accelerating". The solutions of the Einstein field equations that call for this behavior for the current universe, which may require the reintroduction of the cosmological constant, are for a stress-energy which is at least 70% dark energy.|`|4b2bbd06f0269b93cc934bed72028fabaa	mostly that in space, with the speed of light you can essentially fold space and travel so far away that you can witness even earth being born, because afterall, some of the stars that we see in the sky are already dead, light just travels so slowly that we are potentially a million years behind when seeing it from earth|`|180e33dde8692544d9ba2483a248eb37aa	2 points|`|579a6cc163681f088ce83eb17942a4a6aa	Read stephen hawking's ' A brief History of itme'. <br>  Any educated person can understand the theory of relativity after reading this book.|`|e8a123248a60b6f2c75dfd92c5807840aa	nothing can travel faster than light wich always travels at a constant speed.<br>  Time is relative to the speed something travels at, fast travelling things expericence a slower time so live/last longer (opposite to peolpe you notice here) but compared to the fast traveling item time passes faster in slow traveling things.

Get a basin and fill it with water. Then get a kitchen paper towel and draw a line horizontally about 2 cm from the end of one side with a pencil - your base line. Now blot your ink on the line at the same spot to make sure its concentrated. Then suspend the paper towel so that about 1.5cm of the paper towel is in the water - with the base line near the water. Let the water travel up the paper towel - this is through capilary action. When the water level reaches about 2cm from the top of the paper towel, remove the paper towel from the water. If you did the experiment correctly, you would see a few different spots of colours on the paper towel at different areas whereby each coloured spot represents a different component in the ink. Look under the principles of chromatography for the explanation for your project. Good luck!|`|YG3E6Raiaa	Your project can be anything you want, provided you make it a scientific experiment. <br>  <br>  You should ask a question (which may relate to something you observe), form a hypothesis (which is a testable guess), then test the hypothesis.  It's often a good idea to measure something while testing a hypothesis, but it's not any sort of requirement.<br>  <br>  At one time "everybody knew" that heavy objects fell faster than light objects.  A rock obviously falls faster than a feather, right?<br>  <br>  Galileo hypothesized that heavy objects fall as fast as light objects and proceeded to test that by dropping a large and a small ball off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  (A friend at the bottom of the tower observed that they hit the ground at the same time.)<br>  <br>  That was an exceedingly simple experiment, but was of historic importance.  Your science project need not be any less simple.
AtLhkbXOaa	Je crois qu'il s'agit d'un problème de convection. Les matières grasses du lait ont une facheuse tendance à s'agglomérer à la surface (du fait de leur densité), elles forment un barrage à la pénétration des micro-ondes ce qui conjugué à la relative opacité de la tasse, limite l' échauffement.|`|Afcu4Rejaa	Bonjour, <br>  D'une part le rayonnement du four à micro-onde est synchronisé sur la fréquence de résonnance de la molécule d'eau... La répartition de l'eau dans l'aliment devrait donc avoir un effet sur les zones qui vont le plus absorber ce rayonnement.<br>  <br>  D'autre part le lait est légèrement plus lourd que l'eau en elle-même, (même si le lait entier contient environ 88% d'eau.)<br>  <br>  Une première hypothèse peut donc être liée à une disociation par gravité, même faible. Le haut du récipient sera plus fournit en molécules d'eau pure, plus légères que le mélange, et le fond concentrera les particules plus lourdes.<br>  <br>  Dans ce cas le rayonnement du four sera mieux absorbée par la partie du dessus.<br>   <br>  A ceci va probablement s'ajouter un gradient thermique, les zones chaudes, deviennent moins denses, et remontent par effet archimède.<br>  Ceci viendrait renforcer la surpopulation de molécules d'eau pure sur le dessus, par rapport au mélange global et conforter la différence de température observée.|`|H4IM98cZaa	Deux hypotheses pour la premiere question :<br>  -Absorption des micro-ondes differentes, dans l'hypothese ou le recipient est opaque aux micro-ondes (le lait absorberait plus vite et chaufferait sur le dessus) mais je ne connais pas de fondement physique a cela, et apres tout cette hypothese primordiale est inverifiee.<br>  -Difference de viscosite et/ou reaction au chauffage  qui limiteraient le mouvement de convection du lait par rapport a l'eau : j'ai cru voir en chauffant du lait dans une casserolle que c'est tres facile de bruler le lait qui reste dans le fond.<br>  <br>  Or si le lait reste tres chaud a un endroit seulement, la chaleur fuit rapidement a cet endroit. Plus de fuites implique qu'il faut plus d'energie et donc plus de temps pour arriver a la meme temperature globale finale. J'ai constate ca en chauffant de la soupe (convection tres faible) au micro-onde : si je la tourne regulierement, ca met moins longtemps a cuire.<br>  Voila qui repondrait a ta deuxieme question.<br>  <br>  Probleme tres interessant en tous les cas et tres bien pose !|`|MXroseoZaa	Il faut prendre en considération les capacités d'évaporation des deux solutions.

I presume that "f is NOT continuous" is not quite what you meant (seeing as if we end up proving that f(x)=cs, then f(x) IS continuous) - I think what the problem should say is that we are not GIVEN that f(x) is continuous - don't assume it in any steps in the proof.<br>  <br>  We have fairly easily that f(0) = 0:<br>  f(0)=f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0)<br>  =><br>  f(0)=0.<br>  <br>  As the last answer said, for integer n we can easily prove that<br>  f(n) = nf(1)<br>  <br>  I think that in a similar way, for integer m (!= 0) we can prove that<br>  f(1/m) = f(1)/m<br>  <br>  and that<br>  f(n/m) =(n/m)f(1)<br>  <br>  So we have f(x) = cx for all x in Q, by putting c = f(1).  How to extend to all x in R?<br>  <br>  Now I've always been useless at this kind of rigour - can we now say that each member of R can be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of members of Q?  Furthermore, can we use the f(x + y)=f(x) + f(y) property to apply to this infinite series?

Therefore, they are held together by the same type of secondary interactions, that is dispersion forces(some call it London forces). Bromine has a bigger molecular mass and this causes bromine molecules to form extensive dispersion forces among them. So more heat energy is required to break the exensive dispersion forces in bromine than chlorine during boiling.

AA11573642	Alpha decay is one process that unstable atoms can use to become more stable. During alpha decay, an atom's nucleus sheds two protons and two neutrons in a packet that scientists call an alpha particle.<br>  Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atom emits an alpha particle and transforms (or decays) into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less.<br>  Since an atom loses two protons during alpha decay, it changes from one element to another. For example, after undergoing alpha decay, an atom of uranium (with 92 protons) becomes an atom of thorium (with 90 protons).|`|33730b2d5d94d1c6ef837d1886ef7750aa	As any heavy charged particle, alpha particles lose their energy within a very short distance in dense media, causing significant damage to surrounding biomolecules. Generally, external alpha irradiation is not harmful because alpha particles are completely absorbed by the thin layer of dead skin cells in the outermost layer of the skin as well as by a few centimeters of air. However, if a substance radiating alpha particles is ingested, inhaled by, injected into, or introduced through the skin (shrapnel, corrosive chemicals) into an organism it may become a risk, potentially inflicting very serious cellular damage.<br>  <br>  A common household source of alpha radiation is radon, a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil, rock and sometimes groundwater. When radon gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles stick to the inner lining of the lung. The particles that remain continue to decay over time, emitting alpha particles which may damage cells in the lung tissue. Shrapnel deposited in the body from depleted uranium poses another such internal risk of alpha particle radiation dose.
L6SRPioyaa	In beta decay a nuclide has too many neutrons compared to protons and in an attempt to become more stable one of the neutrons flips a quark and becomes a proton.  Now that the nucleus has a positive charge, along with the proton comes a fast electron (beta particle).  Now the atom has too much electron "flavor" and so to balance it, out comes an antineutrino.  The betas are of spectral energy (non-discrete) and the antineutrino carries any deficit.<br>  <br>  Parent nuclide:  mass A, atomic number Z<br>  Daughter nuclide: mass A, atomic number Z+1 by virtue of the new proton.<br>  <br>  There are several possibilities which would lead to "gamma decay," and not all of them are indicative of the daughter nuclide.  Sometimes an atom simply rearranges itself slightly and a gamma leaves, although there is no daughter element to speak of (example: metastable transitioning).|`|AA11573642	Beta decay is one process that unstable atoms can use to become more stable. There are two types of beta decay, beta-minus and beta-plus.<br>  During beta-minus decay, a neutron in an atom's nucleus turns into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino.<br>  During beta-plus decay, a proton in an atom's nucleus turns into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino.<br>  It may be noted that although the numbers of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus change during beta decay, the total number of particles (protons + neutrons) remains the same.

Although there are n roots, often these roots exist in the complex plane.  For example, 8^1/3 has 3 roots; however, we often only think of the "real roots" (a term I'm sure you've commonly heard).  In addition, these roots will always be separated by a constant angle in the complex plane.  Furthermore, these roots will lie on a circle of radius |z|^1/n, where z is 8 in the above example.

When you multiply them, the angles add together.  If a complex number goes 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 of the way around the circle, cubing it goes around the circle once, twice or three times... Since it is a whole number of times, it becomes a real number.

0f12641d40bec50771d796031093d43daa	I think I'd go for (b).<br>  <br>  The market is saying that I'll get 6% pa for the next two years, or 12.36% over the whole period.

For background and formulae, see previous thread :)<br>  <br>  I don't have an answer for the bizarre subject placement suggestion, but I can tell you the formulae for the number of paths between (1, 1) and (p, q) missing out the point (i, j), and have given the formulae for the same situation for n disallowed points: all the details is in  the link below.<br>  <br>  The formula for the number of routes on a grid between the point (1, 1) and (p, q) is<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)!/((p - 1)!*(q - 1)!).<br>  <br>  The formula for the number of routes from a general point (i, j) to a point (p, q) is<br>  <br>  (p + q - i - j)!/((p - i)!*(q - j)!).<br>  <br>  I deduced from this that the number of routes from (1, 1) to (p, q) avoiding (i, j) was<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)!/((p - 1)!*(q - 1)!) - [(i + j - 2)!/((i - 1)!*(j - 1)!)]*[(p + q - i - j)!/((p - i)!*(q - j)!)]<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)C(p - 1) - (i + j - 2)C(i - 1)*(p + q - i - j)C(p - i).<br>  <br>  Then I deduced that if we disallowed 2 points, the formula would be<br>  <br>  [Number of valid routes] = N(O, R) - N(O, P1)*N(P1, R) - N(O, P2)*N(P2, R) + N(O, P1)*N(P1, P2)*N(P2, R);<br>  <br>  where P1 and P2 are our disallowed points, and <br>  <br>  N(A1, A2) means the number of routes from point A1(x1, y1) to point A2(x2, y2), so that<br>  <br>  N(A1, A2) = (x2 + y2 - x1 - y1)!/((x2 - x1)!*(y2 - y1)!).<br>  <br>  This means that if our disallowed points are (i, j) and (i, j + 1), the formula reduces to<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)!/((p - 1)!*(q - 1)!) - [((i + j - 2)!*(p + q - i - j - 1)!)/((i - 1)!*(p - i)!*(j - 1)!*(q - j - 1)!)]*[(p - i)/(q - j) + (i - 1)/j + 1]<br>  <br>  after some simplification using factorials etc.<br>  <br>  For n points, the formula becomes<br>  <br>  N(P0, P(n + 1)) + sum(from m = 1 to n - 1)[(-1)^m*sum(over all S in {Sm})[product(r = 1 to m + 1)[N(Sm(r))]]]<br>  <br>  where Sm is the set of all routes which travel through m disallowed points – see previous thread for details.<br>  <br>  Now, if you think about it; if all the points are in a consecutive line, i.e. Pk = (i, j + k), there is only one route between any pair of them, the route that heads purely to the right - i.e. all the terms like N(Pa, Pb) with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ k - 1 will just be 1. This simplifies the question somewhat - in the notation I wrote the original 'n disallowed points' formula, the expression will be<br>  <br>  N((1, 1), (p, q)) + sum(from m = 0 to k - 2)[(-1)^(m + 1)*sum(from r = 1 to k - m - 1)[sum(from s = m + r to k)[N((1, 1), (i, j + r))*N((i, j + r + s - 1), (p, q))]]].<br>  <br>  (Note I changed 'n' to 'k - 1', given that it seemed an easier way of answering your particular question - so this is the formula if the k - 1 disallowed points are P1 = (i, j + 1), P2 = (i, j + 2) ...

To find this, you have to simplify the first side of the equation: since the denominator for both terms is 4, you end up with (x - 3)/4 = 1/x.  Now you can cross multiply, and you get x^2 - 3x = 4.  Subtract the 4 and set the equation equal to zero, and you're left with a trinomial (x^2 - 3x - 4).  The easiest way to solve this is by factoring, but you could also use the quadratic equation or complete the square.  The answer is (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0.  You could further solve this by setting each separate part equal to zero and solving for x, which would leave you with x = 4, x = -1.|`|4xYIRt0baa	Ans:<br>  1.

ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	The Phoenix probe discovered more water.  The fact that there was water on Mars was already known, the question was "How much?"  <br>  <br>  What it found was a large block of water ice just under the surface of the soil in the high northern latitudes.  Unless by some strange chance it landed on the only block of ice for miles, that means there is a LOT of water on Mars.  Even before the find, the big northern plain called Vastitas Borealis looked like a sea bed and now it seems likely that it once was.<br>  <br>  The atmosphere is the problem.  It is about 95% carbon dioxide and 5% nitrogen with traces of other gases.  It is also very thin.  You cannot breathe it because there is no free oxygen and even if there was there would not be enough at the very low pressure. <br>  <br>  If explorers had some kind of air tight hut to live in, they could explore the surface while wearing space suits.  The fact that there is plenty of water on Mars makes things easier for them as it means it does not have to be sent from Earth. This makes the possibility of some kind of permanent base on Mars more of a possibility.      |`|6mQCGhNYaa	They think it could be frozen water.

As x gets larger, the numerator is always about 2 times as large as the denominator. That's because the numerator is growing at a rate of about twice the rate that the denominator is growing.

AA10927246	No, it isn't the Distributive Property, it is the "Commutative Property of Addition"<br>  <br>  The commutative property says you can change the order in an addition and it doesn't affect the sum.<br>  <br>  In other words:<br>  3 + 4 = 4 + 3<br>  <br>  The rest of the equation doesn't change things because it isn't changing.<br>  2(3 + 4) = 2(4 + 3)<br>  <br>  The only thing that has changed is the order of the two numbers being added.<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  Commutative Property of Addition<br>  <br>  To help you out, here are all the properties explained.<br>  <br>  PROPERTY 1:<br>  Associate Property of Addition.<br>  (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>  <br>  Here you are changing how the values are "associated".  Think of the friends that you associate with.  On the left a and b are "friends".  On the right it has just switched so that b and c are "friends".  The only thing that has changed is the way they are grouped together.<br>  <br>  Think "associate" = "how things are grouped"<br>  <br>  PROPERTY 2:<br>  Commutative Property of Addition<br>  a + b = b + a<br>  <br>  This is the property in your example.  The only thing that has change is the order of the items in the sum.  If you think of commuting in a car say to work or to school, it is how you move.  So the commutative property involves "moving" around a pair of numbers.  a and b have moved so that they are on the opposite side of each other.  This is the commutative property of addition.<br>  <br>  PROPERTY 3:<br>  Identity Property of Addition<br>  a + 0 = a<br>  <br>  Here we've added something (zero) and it hasn't changed the value at all.  Zero is known as the additive identity because you can add him and it does nothing to change the value.  The letter a still has the same "identity" and hasn't changed at all.<br>  <br>  PROPERTY 4:<br>  Distributive Property:<br>  a(b + c) = ab + ac<br>  <br>  Here you are "distributing" the 'a' through the parentheses.  It's like handing out cookies to each person in the room.  That's distributing.|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	3 + 4 = 4 + 3 is Commutative Property|`|Bd16ixUQaa	It is the COMMUTATIVE PROPERTY!<br>  <br>  To help remember what they mean, think about how you would use the words in real life.<br>  <br>  commute is to move around, so it means a + b = b + a<br>  <br>  associative means the numbers can associate (be grouped) in any order but almost always THEY DON'T MOVE AROUND!<br>  Associative would be: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>  You see how on the left, 'b' is associating (or hanging out) with 'a' while on the right, 'b' is associating with 'c'.<br>  Remember, you're associates are the group of people you hang out with.<br>  <br>  distributive property has to do with multiplication and addition in which you equally distribute the term you're multiplying to each item in parentheses.<br>  so, it means a ( b + c) = ab + ac<br>  So, you took the 'a' and distributed it to both the 'b' and the 'c'<br>  In your example, distributive property would be:<br>  2 (3 + 4) = 2(3) + 2(4)<br>  The 2 is distributed (to distribute in regular language is to dish out) to everything in parentheses, that is, the 3 and the 4.<br>  <br>  Identity Property for addition ALWAYS HAS TO DO WITH THE NUMBER ZERO (and for multiplication always has to do with the number one)<br>  Your identity is who/what you are- it doesn't change. If your name is Sarah, then Sarah is Sarah.<br>  In the same way, the identity property is when a number doesn't change.<br>  This only happens (in addition) when you add 0 to something.<br>  a + 0 = a<br>  For multiplication, this only happens when you multiply soemthing by 1:<br>  a (1) = a<br>  So, identity property is<br>  addition: a + 0 = a<br>  multiplication: a x 1 = a<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|b6fbd9560f0cc2003bc358f5f5d2d2cbaa	It's the commutative property.  Commutative says that it doesn't matter if you change the order of the numbers (e.g, 3+4 = 4+3).<br>  <br>  Associative is for multiple operators (e.g. 1+2+3+4) and states that it doesn't matter which ones you add first, it all comes out the same.  Distributive has already been correctly defined.  Identity Property is about adding 0 (e.g., 8 + 0 = 8.)|`|TJaCwL8paa	No, it's the commutative property for addition.  The distributive property would be if they gave you something like this: 2 (3 + 4) = 6 + 8, where the number outside of the parenthesis in the first equation is distributed to the numbers inside the parenthesis.|`|AA12298968	yes, it's distributive because you have to distribute the 2 to the 3 and the 4 so it looks like this:<br>  6+8=8+6<br>  good luck! hope that helped. :)

KPMGVBKsaa	Let a be the 5 digit number (a = xxxxx). <br>  The number when you place 1 in front of a is: 1*10^5 + a = 100000 + a<br>  The number when you place 1 in the end of a is: 10*a + 1<br>  (1xxxxx is simply 100000 + xxxxx, and xxxxx1 is simply xxxxx0 + 1 or xxxxx*10 + 1)<br>  We know the first number is 3 times smaller than 2<br>  So 3*(100000 + a ) = 10*a + 1<br>  300000 + 3a = 10a + 1<br>  --> a = 42857<br>  You can check the answer by dividing 428571 by 142857

K9Mn7UnZaa	When working with fractions, you ALWAYS have to have them on a common base before adding or subtracting. It looks like a good common base here will be 12x , because all the bases can easily be multiplied to it.<br>  <br>  So we'll multiply both the top and bottom of each term by a number in order to get the denominator to be equal to 12x. This can be accomplished by multiplying the first term by (3/3), the second by (3x/3x), the third by (4/4) and the fourth by (4x/4x). The reason we multiply the top and bottom by the same thing is so that the equation doesn't change (for example 4/4 = 1, multiplying by 1 changes nothing).<br>  <br>  So now we have (9-3x+4-8x)/12x = (13-11x)/12x|`|fJ7o8iMUaa	You need a common denominator.

z7BiMSWmaa	Hydrogen peroxide is a harmful by-product of many normal metabolic processes: To prevent damage, it must be quickly converted into other, less dangerous substances. To this end, catalase is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into less reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules.<br>  Catalase can also oxidize different toxins, such as formaldehyde, formic acid, and alcohols.<br>  <br>  Without catalase our bodies would be full of harmful toxins and all our metabolic processes may well grind to a halt.

ZYVwL6j8aa	pka's indicate the strength of the acid. The higher the pka, the weaker the acid.<br>  <br>  Amino acids have the COOH and the NH3+, both of which can act as acid (meaning they can both lose the H). The lower the pka, the more willing the acid is in donating its H.<br>  <br>  Amino acids generally have two pka's (some has an additional pka on its side chain): at 2 and at 9. The pka = 2 is the pka of the COOH group, and the pka = 9 is the pka of the amino group. <br>  <br>  At pH = 2, the COOH will become COO- but the NH3+ will remain as NH3+. When pH = 9, the NH3+ will finally lose its H, yielding NH2. So at neutral pH (pH=7), an amino acid would have its carboxyl group deprotonated (COO-) and its amino group protonated (NH3+). At pH = 10, we would have COO- and NH2. At pH = 1, we would have COOH and NH3+.

So the work done by the frictional force (or WF2) = (F2) * (Δx) * (cos π) = 125 * 7 * (-1) = -875 Joules i guess... Also, the work done by gravity is 0 since the cosine of 3π/2 or 270 degrees is zero, or better: Work by gravity (or WB) = B * Δx * cos (270) = B * Δx * 0 = 0 Joules...<br>  Hope this is correct and what you asked for!

AA10492394	las leyes de la fisica clasica se comportan diferente a nivel atomico, asi que la respuesta seria no, para eso (lo pequeno) se estudia fisica cuantica|`|PX2j5f1Yaa	La física que estudia y explica los fenómenos que ocurren en el dominio de los átomos, de sus núcleos y de las partículas elementales se denomina cuántica; y la teoría matemática básica que explica los movimientos y relaciones en este campo se denomina mecánica cuántica. No se debe sin embargo pensar que la física cuántica no corresponde al mundo macroscópico, en realidad toda la física es cuántica; y las leyes de ésta tal como las conocemos hoy, constituyen nuestras leyes MáS GENERALES de la naturaleza.<br>  <br>  En el mundo macroscópico las leyes de la naturaleza que se han descubierto son las denominadas leyes de la física clásica; en estas se tratan aquellos aspectos de la naturaleza para los que la cuestión de cuál es la constitución última de la materia no es algo que importe en forma inmediata. Cuando aplicamos las leyes de la física clásica a los sistemas macroscópicos tratamos de describir solamente ciertos rasgos globales del comportamiento del sistema. Los detalles más finos del comportamiento del sistema se ignoran. En este sentido las leyes de la física clásica son leyes aproximadas de la naturaleza y debemos considerarlas como formas límite de las leyes de la física cuántica, más fundamentales y que abarcan mucho más. Las teorías clásicas son teorías fenomenológicas. Una teoría fenomenológica intenta descubrir y resumir hechos experimentales dentro de un cierto dominio limitado de la física. No se persigue describirlo todo en el reino de la física, pero si es una buena teoría fenomenológica, describirá de manera muy precisa cualquier aspecto dentro de aquel dominio limitado. En realidad toda teoría física es fenomenológica (trata de los fenómenos o eventos o hechos que ocurren).<br>  <br>  Como decimos, las teorías clásicas no poseen validez universal, aunque son muy buenas teorías fenomenológicas, no lo dicen todo acerca de los cuerpos macroscópicos. Por ejemplo no podemos explicar por qué las densidades son lo que son, por qué las constantes elásticas de los materiales tienen los valores que tienen, por qué se rompe una barra cuando la sometemos a una tensión mas allá de cierto límite, por qué el cobre funde a 1083oC, por qué el vapor de sodio emite luz amarilla, por qué brilla el sol, por qué el núcleo de uranio se desintegra espontáneamente, por qué la plata conduce la electricidad, por qué el azufre no conduce la electricidad; se podría seguir con muchos ejemplos de la vida cotidiana o que tienen cierto impacto en muchas de las cosas de esta vida cotidiana, acerca de los cuales la física clásica tiene poco o nada que decirnos.<br>  <br>  El hombre siempre estuvo y sigue estando interesado en conocer o poder explicarse de donde salió y como funciona todo, y por eso investiga buscando saber si existe una teoría general de la materia. No tenemos hoy en día una teoría detallada para todo lo que ocurre en nuestro mundo, sin embargo y sobre todo en el siglo XX, es mucho lo que se avanzó, por ejemplo comprendiendo ahora muy bien los hechos de la química y las propiedades de la materia macroscópica; en estos dominios de la física se puede hoy responder a cuestiones que no podían resolverse dentro de la teoría clásica.<br>  <br>  Podemos decir hoy que el modelo estándar de la física de las partículas, que se basa en las reglas de la mecánica cuántica, nos dice como está construido el mundo a partir de ciertos bloques fundamentales, que se mantienen unidos gracias al intercambio de energía en forma de partículas; pero no creamos que dicho modelo estándar es el definitivo ya que el ser humano a través de su inteligencia sigue en la búsqueda. Ahora yo me pregunto ?Por qué sigue en la búsqueda? ?Habrá algo innato, genético, incrustado en la naturaleza del hombre que lo lleva a esta búsqueda? ?Será una llamada o un mensaje dejado por alguien? ?Será la semejanza de un Dios creador que tenemos incorporada? Es muy probable que a nadie le interese esto como para dedicarle mas que una fracción de su tiempo; pero no podemos decir que sea cual fuere la duración de dicha fracción, si alcanzamos a percibir algo aunque sea a través del intellectus,  nos quedamos totalmente maravillados.<br>  <br>  Cuando el físico Max Planck, estudió la radiación del cuerpo *****, que es un cuerpo incandescente, sacó su conclusión de que la energía era absorbida y emitida en cuantos de energía proporcionales a la frecuencia de la luz que se irradia. La constante de esta proporcionalidad es un numero, muy pero muy peque?o, del orden  de 10-34 esto es 0,000000000000000000000000000000001. Es bueno ahora tratar de tener una cierta sensibilidad para darnos cuenta lo lejos que están nuestras experiencias diarias de lo que denominamos mundo cuántico. Si existiera un terrón de azúcar de dicha dimensión en cm, necesitaríamos varios billones (exactamente 1034) de dichos objetos para cubrir la distancia de 1 cm. Veamos que es esto en nuestra realidad. Si tomáramos la misma cantidad de terrones de azúcar (1034) y los pusiéramos uno al lado del otro, cubrirían una distancia de 1000 millones de a?os luz. El mundo cuántico opera en una escala mucho menor que la relación existente entre la dimensión de un terrón de azúcar y la de todo el universo observable.<br>  <br>  Detengámonos un momento en la dimensión de un átomo.

Asi:<br>  Los denominadores de las dos fracciones: 1/x = 2/3    (x y 3)  Se pasan al lado contrario de la igualdad respectivo, lo que quiere decir, la x se pasa a la derecha y el 3 se pasa hacia la izquierda... los dos quedan multiplicando, asi:<br>                                           <br>                                            3 . 1 = 2 . x<br>  Ahora solo te queda despejar la x... como?? dejandola sola...

Qu1vauSRaa	Maxima and minima occur of a function occur when the derivative of that function = 0.  (I'm not sure if your class is looking at this, but there can also be a sort of maximum or minimum in the form of a horizontal asymptote, but that's not an issue here - the limits as x goes to positive and negative infinity are both infinity.)  So to solve this, we need to determine where the derivative = 0 and test to see if we've found a maximum or minimum.<br>  <br>  y = (x^2 + 1) ^ (2/3)   ......

The other side can be re-written as<br>  <br>  1 / (x^2 + 1)^(1/3) = 0<br>  <br>  1 divided by anything is never zero, so this has no solutions.  So the only possibility is x = 0.<br>  <br>  Let's check something to either side of x = 0 to see if we've found a maximum or a minimum.  <br>  <br>  x = 0 gives y = 1<br>  x = 1 gives y = 2 ^ (2/3), which is greater than 1<br>  x = -1 also gives y = 2 ^ (2/3), which is greater than 1<br>  <br>  So x = 0 is a minimum.

H4IM98cZaa	Les précédentes réponses ne traitent que de cas particuliers où les propriétés quantiques de la matière se manifestent. Je crois que ta question était plut?t "pourquoi ne se manifestent-elles pas en général?". Comment se fait-il qu'en temps normal la physique "naturelle" prévaut, alors qu'à l'échelle microscopique seule la mécanique quantique s'applique?<br>  <br>  Pour répondre simplement, on pourrait dire que c'est à cause :<br>  1. du très grand nombre de particules considéré (ex : plus de 10^23 atomes par gramme de matière, classiquement), qui fait que les effets quantiques (comme la quantification des états : les particules ne peuvent adopter que certaines positions, vitesses, énergies) se "moyennent" et disparaissent.<br>  2. de l'agitation thermique et de l'échange incessant de photons (lumière), phonons (vibrations) entre les particules de matière, ce qui leur fait perdre leurs propriétés quantiques (typiquement leurs propriétés ondulatoires), par un processus que l'on appelle la décohérence.<br>  <br>  Je pense que le second point est le plus important à expliquer, car il montre vraiment bien pourquoi les propriétés quantiques ne peuvent subsister dans notre environnement naturel.<br>  Il faut savoir que la physique quantique est vraiment une histoire d'état incertain d'une particule. En fait, on se rend compte que lorsqu'on ne demande rien à une particule, elle n'a pas une position, une vitesse, un état énergétique (etc) fixes, mais elle a une quantité d'états (quantifiés) superposés. Dès lors que des états sont possibles, elle les adopte tous à la fois. Elle est à plusieurs positions, vitesses, états "à la fois". D'où toutes les propriétés bizarres. Ce n'est que lorsqu'on lui demande où elle est, à quelle vitesse elle va, quel est son état énergétique, qu'elle va répondre, et d'un seul coup, se fixer dans l'état qu'elle a dit avoir. Pendant un moment, la particule garde cet état fixe ; plus de propriétés quantiques. <br>  Eh bien, il se trouve par exemple que dès lors que la matière n'est pas au zéro absolu en température, des photons sont constamment émis par les particules. Ces grains de lumière trahissent leur état : comme si on leur avait "demandé" dans quel état elles étaient. Aussit?t, elles se figent dans l'état qu'elles ont trahi. A température ambiante, donc, les particules sont la plupart du temps figées dans un état donné, et la matière perd ses propriétés quantiques.<br>  <br>  Pour prouver cette assertion, il suffit de refroidir la matière au zéro absolu, et de voir si elle reprend ses propriétés quantiques, me diras-tu. Eh bien, on sait le faire, et ?a marche : on sait refroidir du rubidium par exemple à quelques 100 μK (dans ce qu'on appelle un condensat de Bose-Einstein), et alors il produit un phénomène assez incroyable, le paquet d'atomes se comporte comme une onde! <br>  <br>  Conclusion : la matière perd ses propriétés quantiques dans notre environnement naturel pour deux raisons : l'énergie thermique ambiante leur fait perdre leur superposition d'états,  et leur très grand nombre fait dispara?tre la quantification de ces états.<br>  <br>  J'espère avoir répondu assez clairement à ta question!<br>  <br>  Julien<br>  Ingénieur en optique physique<br>  Médiateur au Palais de la Découverte|`|2b1de3aab3c3a6ef3b43f5424bd65c77aa	Je sais pas.

Pourquoi l'apparition de ce phénomen? Parce que les énergie mise en jeu de la température (1/2*kT) devient de l'ordre des énergies du système. A température normal, tout cela est noyé dans un bruit thermique.<br>  <br>  Autre applications que l'on peut voir, c'est le rayonnement des atomes, qui forment des raies, et non pas un spectre continu...<br>  <br>  On a donc bien la mécanique quantique à notre effet, mais en général, les énergie mise en jeu en méca Q sont très inférieur aux autres dans le milieu environnant.|`|9Az9Ir8Naa	En fonction de la vitesse. Quand la chaleur augmente, les particules s'agitent. Si elle augmente suffisamment, on considère que quand les particules atteignent 0,1 fois la vitesse de la lumière la physique normale ne s'applique plus, on utilise la physique quantique.<br>  <br>  Les règles ne sont pas bizarres, ce sont souvent les mêmes corrigées d'un facteur (appelé gamma, va savoir pourquoi, rien à voir avec les rayonnements) qui augmente de plus en plus avec l'augmentation de la vitesse de la particule. Plus elle se rapproche de la vitesse de la lumière, plus la correction apportée sera grande.|`|Mb2xsHxjaa	c'est une bonne question mais qui n'a pas de réponses actuellement. et je penses qu'elle sera peut être résolue quand les physiciens auront réussi à fusionner les 4 forces fondamentales de la nature (électromagnétisme, force electrofaible, forte et gravité)|`|ns6wvnhTaa	La mécanique quantique est la physique de "l'infiniment petit". Toute matière respecte les règles de la mécanique quantique si tu la regardes de suffisament prêt. Les atomes et électrons qui constituent les molécules de ta peau respectent la mécanique quantique. Mais les effets de la mécanique quantique ne se font plus sentir dès que tu atteint une taille supérieure à la molécule.<br>  <br>  Par exemple, un des aspects importants de la mécanique quantique, c'est le calcul des orbites des électrons. Pour comprendre comment un électron "orbite" autour d'un atome, il faut faire de la mécanique quantique de manière pointue.<br>   Si tu fais de la chimie et que tu essayes de comprendre comment deux atomes se lient ensemble, tu as besoins de notions de mécanique quantique, mais qui peuvent être simplifiés. Tu n'as pas besoin de tous les détails des subtilités de la mécanique quantique pour comprendre comment vont interragir entre eux les électrons des atomes qui forment ta molécule.<br>   Et si tu fais de la biologie, tu sais que tu as une molécule et tu as franchement besoin de très peu d'information sur ce que font les électrons des molécules de tes atomes. A ce niveau là, la mécanique quantique ne te sers plus à rien pour expliquer le fonctionnement d'un organe vivant, même d'une bactérie.<br>  <br>  C'est plus clair ?<br>  <br>  PS : Hébus, tu confonds mécanique quantique et mécanique relativiste. Einstein a travaillé sur la mécanique relativiste, où la vitesse joue effectivement une notion fondamentale et qui traite de l'infiniment grand, des planêtes, des galaxie, de l'univers. Il n'a jamais travaillé sur la mécanique quantique, qui traite de l'infiniment petit et des atomes. Rien à voir.|`|5Mhnuf5Gaa	c'est le phénomène de la décohérence.

03e31407685a21ab50c8bf9fbd24b1d1aa	Any object with mass (weight) exhibits gravity – even you do, but as your mass is significantly less than a planet, the effect is negligible.  As to HOW mass causes gravity, is still one of the great mysteries of science.<br>  <br>  The current theory involves an as yet undiscovered particle – the Higgs boson, which is thought to impart mass on the other elementary particles and hence all matter.  This idea was put forward by Peter Higgs and others in 1963 and the main reason that all the effort and money has gone into building the Large Hadron Collider, is to find this elusive particle.  It is hoped that this will then allow scientists to move one step closer to a Theory of Everything, bringing gravity and the other fundamental forces together for the first time and with it a complete explanation of gravity.  We wait with baited breath !|`|J88wE7fsaa	Lewis Epstein in Relativity visualized shows how the effects of gravitation in one dimension might be accomplished by rolling, bending, or folding a spacetime diagram; how the downward pull is due to a gradient in the speed of time.<br>  <br>  It only works in one dimension though, because once you've used the first dimension in space, the second in time, and the third folding the paper, there's not enough room in space for the other two dimensions.|`|3zQfULwtaa	Mathematically, we can quantify gravity; G times mass 1 times mass 2 divided by the square of the distance between the masses equals the gravitational force.

xPqpwSkuaa	this is more philosophy than astrnonmy, but i'll take a crack at it.<br>  <br>  the arguement is, that at least one of them has to exist, or else, our experiences are how we interpret something that is non-existant...<br>  <br>  the past used to exist.  as you are asking this in an astronomy forum, you might get answers like, "the past must be certain, because we can see the past now, because what we see (thanks to light speed nopt being instantaneous) has already happened.<br>  <br>  the present, might be harder to prove exists, because everything we interpret as now, has to be processed by our brain over the course of a few split-seconds, so when we say "now" in relation to what we hear, say, feel, smell, and notice, it is already in the past.<br>  <br>  the future, is more difficult to explain.  is it that thing that never comes?  two seconds from now is "the future" but when two seconds pass...  two seconds from the new now is still in the future...|`|kAi14kKxaa	Time is always moving forward -- so in order for the "present" to exist, it must also move forward in relativity to the continuation of time.<br>  <br>  Imagine this -- an arrow is shot at a moving target. However, as the arrow moves forward, so does the target -- as the arrow moves 1 meter closer, the target moves 0.5 meters away. <br>  Will the arrow strike the target? In theory, it never will.<br>  <br>  Mathematically, the arrow will never strike the target because as the arrow inches closer and closer, the distance between the arrowhead and the target will fall closer and closer to an infinitely small number.<br>  At one point, the arrow will be 1 cm away -- at another, it could be 0.1... 0.001, 0.00891 cm away. It will never reach an absolute zero.<br>  <br>  How does this relate to the "present"? If you were to visualize the "present" as the target, and "you" as the arrow, are you in the present, or the past? Are we perpetually "lagging" behind the presence?<br>  Scientifically, this is impossible to prove because our units of measurement prevents the exact calculation of time at a certain instance.<br>  <br>  So my advice is.... don't worry about it.|`|GSKVdulNaa	I've thought that before. Scientists always bang on about the dimension of time and space, but really they are only assuming that anything like time exists.

For example, if you look at the sun, you are seeing what it looked like about 8 seconds ago.

Depending on the velocity of the observer, the order of those events are interchangable.  They are regarded as simultaneous... or they have a "spacelike" space-time interval between them.<br>  <br>  In any case, you can always establish the space-time interval between two events as either space-like (present) or time-like (past or future.)<br>  <br>  Edit:  Michael C is more-or-less correct, except he is thinking of the present being a plane in spacetime.  Yes, you can move distant events above and below that plane, by accelerating toward or away from them.  But you can't move them in and out of the future cone or the past cone.  Once they've got into those cones, they are either definitely in the past or definitely in the future.|`|3lVgelz9aa	No, time is completely relative.<br>  <br>  This is due to the fact that light has a finite speed. Say we are both standing in the same room watching a TV screen. I am one foot away and you are three feet away. The light takes a little bit more time to reach you then it does to reach me. Therefore we are actually watching a slightly different image. We each exist in our own little bubble of perception that is slightly different from everyone else.<br>  <br>  Of course, on such a small scale the difference is so imperceptibly small you can't even notice it. However, when an astronomy is looking at a star billions of light years away he really is looking into the past (by hundreds or thousands of years.) If aliens on a planet far away were to look at the Earth, we would appear to them to still be in the Stone Age.<br>  <br>  As I said, time is relative and entirely based on perception.|`|6a0e87de6c68636efe63ec4b24229463aa	According to general relativity, it all exists. If we could make wormholes, we could travel to any place and any when.

I never expected any of my programs to still be running that long, considering the changes in computers each year.    When the problem was realized, a LOT of time and money went into inspecting the software and coming up with fixes.  The greatest concern was where the year was locked into calculations in devices that could not be accessed, such as airplanes and satellites or were hidden in odd lines of code.    And the solutions, in some cases, just postponed - some programs will expire in about 20 years when long integer dates run out.   And some of the fixes will cause problems way down the road - for example, any routine that has to allow for leap years has a calculation to do it, but 2100 is not a leap year (unlike 2000 where we lucked out) to make a small adjustment to the difference between a 24 hour day and the time it takes the earth to orbit the earth.  A lot of programs just say there is a leap year every 4 years. Lotus 123 got it wrong for 1900.  Will any of our programs cause problems - have to wait till 2099 I guess.    "A leap day is added every 4 years because the earth actually takes about 365.25 days to orbit the sun.  But because the actual orbit is a bit less, only those century years where the top two digits, like 20 are divisible by 4 will be leap years, the others 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 being ordinary years."|`|egrCder6aa	Some say it came from the bible and others were just rumors that got way out of hand.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	It's because of the planets' inertia. Inertia is the resistance of an object to change its state of motion. Inertia is what makes a stationary object remain stationary, and a moving object carry on moving, unless you apply a force to it.    The planets are moving perpendicular to the sun, and even though the sun is exerting gravitational pull on them, it doesn't stop them from moving. So what the planets do is fall towards the sun but at the same time move sideways, causing them to literally miss the sun. They fly past the sun and go for another round, so to speak.    In other words, the orbits of the planets are due to the balance between the sun's gravity and their own inertia. Without the sun's gravity, they would fly off into space in a straight line; without the inertia, they would fall into the sun.|`|3eIuXzrAaa	Think of it as a rock tied to string, what happens when you hold one end of the string and swing it around. The rock goes around your hand, similar to how a planet orbits the sun. In this model the only thing you need to replace the tension in the string with is gravitational attraction between the planet and the sun.    Basically I believe that one day the earth will be sucked into the sun, all the planets are most likely getting closer and closer to the sun every day. At least this should be the general trend. The only thing keeping a planet in its orbit is its centripetal force which acts in the opposite direction of the gravitational force. In a sense the two forces cancel and thus the planet neither gets closer or further away from the sun.|`|DRSjrp04aa	BEcause the earths magnet makes it move, I think anyway!  Ask Einstein|`|Q8LKXkZ0aa	The pull of a planets gravity  is not enough to be pulled into each other or into the sun. Like someone else said, think of it as two magnets repelling each other. I think it goes something like that anyway. Just hope that someone from NASA or something see's this question lol|`|ThJ9UVHYaa	The reason why the planets are moving at such speed that they can resist the gravitational force of the sun.|`|n102y2SMaa	yes|`|4PkRRHEtaa	Because the planets are already moving, and the gravitational pull of the sun is just enough to provide centripetal acceleration to keep the planets revolving around it. Think of it like this: By the time the sun pulls a planet to its y-coordinate, the planet has already moved to a different x-coordinate. And by the time the sun pulls it to its x-coordinate, it's already at a different y-coordinate.    Hope you get what I mean...|`|XuVwWIMeaa	they do get sucked into the sun, but lucky for us, we are moving forward at the same time.  That way, we move forward as far as we fall, so the result is an orbit.  Should we stop moving forward, we would fall into the sun.  We orbit because of a combination of speed and gravity, no gravity we would fly off in a straight path, no velocity we would fall to a firey death|`|WQkyRBeRaa	Its because the centripetal force that is driving the object to rotate is directed opposite the pull of gravity. This force is not outwayed by the pull of gravity so the object keeps orbiting.

NbdTgyLPaa	There are a few ways to calculate the area.  In my sources, the first link is to a trapezoid that was drawn with the dimensions you specify.  (The drawing is a bit of a cheat, in that I made it after I had the solution, but it helps to see it to visualize the steps below.)<br>  <br>  When drawing the trapezoid, I added two new points, E and F, on the line segment CD such that AE and BF are both perpendicular to CD.  The line segments AE and BF are of equal length, and their length is equal to the height of the trapezoid.  I did this to find the height as with this we can then calculate the area of the trapezoid.<br>  <br>  Because you have an isosceles trapezoid, you know that CF = ED.  You also know that CF + FE + ED = CD.  As ABFE makes a rectangle, we know that AB = FE.  Combining all of this tells us<br>  ED + AB + CF = CD<br>  2ED + 2 = 8<br>  ED = 3<br>  <br>  Notice that AED is a right triangle with AD being the hypotenuse.  So<br>  (AE)^2 + (ED)^2 = (AD)^2<br>  (EA)^2 + (3)^2 = (5)^2<br>  EA = 4<br>  Which is the height of the trapezoid.<br>  <br>  From this point there are two ways to get the area.  If you know the formula for the Area of your trapezoid = h(a+b)/2 where h is the height and a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides.  This gives Area = 4(2+8)/2 = 20.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you could calculate the areas of the pieces in the diagram, that is the two triangles AED and BCF (with equal areas), and the rectangle ABFE.  The Area of the rectangle that we made is base times height = 2*4 = 8.  The area of either triangle is (1/2) times base times height = (1/2)*3*4 = 6.  Adding the areas would gives us the area of the trapezoid, 8 + 6 + 6 = 20.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, there is a formula that you can just plug in the sides to get the area.  In this case, let<br>  a = length of the longer parallel side, in your case CD = 8<br>  c = length of the shorter parallel side, in your case AB = 2<br>  b = length of a non parallel side<br>  d = length of the other non parallel side<br>  Note in our case, b = d = BC = AD = 5.<br>  Then<br>  Area = (a+c)sqrt[(a+b-c+d)(a-b-c-d)(a+b-c-d)(-a... / [4(a-c)]<br>  (8+2)sqrt[(8+5-2+5)(8-5-2+5)(8+5-2-5)(... / [4(8-2)]<br>  = 10sqrt(16*6*6*4)/(4*6)<br>  = 10*4*6*2/(4*6)<br>  = 20<br>  <br>  Now that you have the area of the trapezoid, multiplying by the height of the prism will give you the volume.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

AI2SRjLaaa	Each of these countries has Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. So The Queen of Australia, the Queen of England and the Queen of Canada is the same person, Queen Elizabeth II. It just so happens that she resides in England, because of course it is tradition.<br>  <br>  Canada and Australia were colonies of Great Britain until they got their independance from great britain, although both countries are still part of the Comonwealth of nations, it doesn't mean they are ruled by Great Britain (they are ruled by their queen) but they are part of the community, along with India, South Africa etc.<br>  <br>  Note: Canada, Australia and the UK are governed independently of each other with their own governments, they simply share the same head of state. She has duties in Australia, Canada and the UK. The UK does not rule Canada or Australia, the Queen does.<br>  <br>  Note: Note the difference between 'ruled' and 'governed'. The latter term implies the government, law making process, foreign affairs, domestic duties and the lot, while the term 'ruled' implies the Queen as a figure head. Yes she has power in all these countries, the has the right to use it and has used it in the past, but only occasionally when the need arises. <br>  <br>  The Queen is the leader of all these nations individually, although each nation is governed by themselves. There is no link between the government of Canada, Australia and the UK. ie, neither government has authority over the other, hence the term governed individually.<br>  <br>  Note: When the Queen uses her power in Canada or Australia, she does it as the Queen of Australia or the Queen of Canada, similarly, she she uses her power in the UK, she is acting as the Queen of England. Recently, she dissolved the Canadian parliament for one reason or another, she has also sacked a Prime Minister (leader of the government) in Australia.<br>  <br>  Hierarchy of power:<br>  <br>  The People elect government representatives and senators (house of representatives, senate, house of commons and lords in the UK) >>>>>> Government elected representatives make laws, both domestic and foreign affairs >>>>>> Monarch does not have any influence on whether the laws are passed, the laws do not go through her, (hence the term figure head) although she is at the top and has the power to dissolve the government or the PM an the like.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	Both still consider the British monarch to be the head of state.|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	they were both colonized by Great Britain and, then later became their own countries|`|KHSOVxViaa	Iskandar is almost exactly correct (and my vote for best answer), except for the fact there's no Queen of England (defunct title) - I think she means Queen of the UK.<br>  <br>  England hasn't had its own queen or king for hundreds of years since the UK was formed.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the Queen has a representative in each of these countries called the Governor-General, who handles the day-to-day functions of head of state.

Your terms are on either side of the plus or minus side. So let's look at 6a+6c. Both terms (6a) and (6c) have a 6. So factor that out. Factoring out is a lot like dividing. If I divide 6a by 6, I'm left with a, and if I divide 6c by 6, I'm left with c. You can't get rid of your 6 though, it becomes a factor in front. So it will look like 6(a+c). In order to check yourself, multiply your two factors out, and see if you get the original problem. If you distribute 6(a+c), you'll have 6a+6c, which is the original problem. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I have the other two answered before.

NbdTgyLPaa	1) I am not quite sure what's being asked here.  The vertex is a point, dilating a point won't change how it looks.  So I am guessing what the question wants is to know the new position of the vertex, which in this case I think would be the equivalent of (10,40) on the old scale since you multiply the distance from the origin by 5.<br>  <br>  2) This is a simple problem of ratios.  Basically the problem says 150 feet is to the height, as 6 feet is to 2 feet.  So<br>  150 ft/height = 6 ft/2 ft<br>  150 ft/height = 3<br>  150 ft = 3 * height<br>  50 ft = height<br>  So the pole is 50 feet tall.

8gnp5Kkjaa	Okay simplifying a radical means you have to know what the perfect squares are.  Here is an example of some common perfect squares:<br>  <br>  4  (2x2)<br>  9  (3x3)<br>  16  (4x4)<br>  25  (5x5)<br>  36  (6x6)<br>  49  (7x7)<br>  64  (8x8)<br>  81  (9x9)<br>  100  (10x10)<br>  <br>  So here is how to simplify a radical.  <br>  1. Find the largest perfect square which will divide evenly into the number under your radical sign.  This means that when you divide, you get no remainders, no decimals, no fractions.<br>  <br>  So to reduce √27, you should know that the largest perfect square that divides evenly into 27 is 9.  (9x3=27)<br>  <br>  2.  Write the number appearing under your radical as the product (multiplication) of the perfect square and your answer from dividing.<br>  Example:  √27 = √(9x3)<br>  <br>  3. Give each number in the product its own radical sign:<br>  √27 = √9 x √3<br>  <br>  4. Reduce the "perfect" radical that you created:<br>  √27 = 3√3<br>  <br>  5.  Now you have your answer!<br>  <br>  Just keep that table of perfect squares handy and it will make things easier.|`|bR7kb9F3aa	mixed radical is when you have an integer multiplied by a radical. so therefore the square root of 27 can be written as the square root of 9 times the square root of 3.

AA11320928	S-waves are transverse waves, oscillating from side to side. The therefore rely on having a solid, rigid medium to travel through, like the mantle or inner core, and when they enter a liquid, like the outer core, their oscillations are absorbed. No S waves from the mantle can reach the inner core.    P-waves, however, are longitudinal pressure waves, and can pass through both solids and liquids. I'm guessing you know this much :). The fun happens when P waves penetrate through the outer core and reach the inner/outer core boundary. Most P waves will not meet the boundary travelling (and oscillating) perpendicular to it, but at an angle. There is therefore a component of their oscillation parallel to the boundary, and this sets up new S-waves in the inner core.    When they reach the other side, a component of their oscillation is transferred back to P-waves in the outer core, and can reach the surface. This is how we can detect them.    Hope that made sense :)!|`|AA12139405	S wave will not disappear .It gets reflected by liquid cores. That will again reflected by asthenosphere.

FY4cCjsOaa	If x is odd, then either  x = 4k + 1 or  x = 4k + 3  for some integer k.    If x = 4k + 1, then  x^2 - 1 = (4k + 1)^2 - 1  = 16k^2 + 8k = 8(2k^2 + k)  is clearly divisible by 8.    If x = 4k + 3, then  x^2 - 1 = (4k + 3)^2 - 1  = 16k^2 + 24k + 8 = 8(2k^2 + 3k + 1)  is clearly divisible by 8.    Therefore, if x is odd, then 8 divides x^2 + 1.    Therefore, if 8 does not divide x^2 - 1, then x is even. (That's the contrapositive of the proven previous statement.)

This gives us 43890 / 20520. Now we need to simplify. We can tell they are both divisible by 10 since they end in zero, so we can simplify to 4389/2052. Since the digits of both top and bottom add up to a multiple of 3, they are divisible by 3. This gives us 1463/684. Both of these are divisible by 19, so we get 77/36. our final answer.    The other way to do it is to reduce the fractions before multiplying, but that's hard to write out in this text box. I'll try though:    57/20 x 35/38 x 22/27    You need to find a pair of numbers on the top and bottom that have a common factor.  57 = 3*19 and 38 = 2*19, so change 57 and 38 to 3 and 2  3/20 x 35/2 x 22/27    3 and 27 can similarly be reduced to 1 and 9 (divide by 3).  1/20 x 35/2 x 22/9    20 and 35 reduce to 4 and 7 (divide by 5).  1/4 x 7/2 x 22/9    Finally, 2 and 22 to 1 and 11 (divide by 2).  1/4 x 7/1 x 11/9    This also gives us 77/36, and is actually the easiest way to solve problems like this.|`|gWS4Cx9qaa	X|`|hh7167Zzaa	19/2 x 7/38 x 11/9    1463/684

AA12108882	Diamond, although the hardest natural substance, does not have the same hardness in every direction in its crystal structure. Think of it like a piece of wood having a grain - cutting a log across the grain is hard work but splitting a log along the grain is easy. When diamond powder is applied to the skaif (cutting disc) it is a random mixture of crystal directions so about half the particles are going to have their hard side forward. The diamond to be cut is held against the skaif with its softer "grain"  pointing in the direction of rotation which allows the harder particles to abrade the facet of the stone being cut. This involves the stone being turned many, many times during the cutting process. The same principle is also used when one saws large diamond crystals into practical pieces ready for cutting.<br>  Hope this helps a little.|`|xWKOiwoHaa	hey don't so much cut but actually grind down the surfaces using a disc covered in small diamonds.

oVz6sPsIaa	The center bulb is burned out.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	The difference between the "hot" line and the neutral, or ground, line is what gives you a voltage reading.  In a series circuit, each time the voltage goes through a resistance, it is reduced.  In this case, the bulb act as the resistance.  The first bulb has all the voltage going through it, but it is reduced when it reaches the second bulb.  This continues with each bulb until it gets to the last one.  With 0v going into the last bulb, there is 0 v coming out.  With the last bulb connected to the return (ground) side with 0 v, input voltage is 0 and output voltage is 0.  With no difference in voltage, the bulbs will not light.|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	The central bulb across which the potential difference is 240 V and not (240k V as mistakenly written) has fused breaking the circuit and making the current, i  in circuit zero. That is why voltage across every other bulb, of resiatnce, r say = ir = 0. Because there is no potential difference across all bulbs except central one, the voltage across the central bulb and across the first bulb is the same and equal to supply voltage. Because of this observation you can also conclude that all bulbs except the central bulb are not fused. However any one of them can be short-circuited.
Ne5I7Ranaa	Freezing point depression and boiling point elevation depend solely on the amount of solute.    For the first problem, CH3OH has a molecular weight of 32, so 60g is 1.875 moles. Similarly, 120g of CH3CH2OH is equivalent to 2.61 moles. Since the second solution has twice the amount of solvent but less than twice the amount of solute, compared to the first solution, its freezing point is not as depressed. Therefore, the CH3OH solution will have the lower freezing point.    Do the same for the second one. 10g of CH3CH2OH is 0.217 moles. 10g of H2O is 0.556 moles. There is more H2O compared to CH3CH2OH, so the H2O in CH3OH solution will have the lower freezing point.

xXOnjDNOaa	Generally when steam distilling it is a compound that is immiscible with water (so that when you condense them it is easy to separate them), it may be that your compound will dissolve in the n-propanol once they are recondensed, requiring yet another distillation.  Not completely certain here, just a guess.    Edit:   After thinking about it some more, if n-propanol weren't immiscible with whatever you were distilling, not only would you have a second separation step, but there would also be the issue of boiling point  _elevation_ due to the mixing, whereas steam distillation usually tries to take advantage of boiling point _depression_ due to the two liquids being immiscible (so you can distill at a lower temperature).|`|YZ4ozLyyaa	cos it ran away with the spoon|`|BVgZ4Do4aa	the valency is diffrent, propanol will not partake in a substitution reaction unless there is a higher in put, to 'kick' the other bonds and H20 'off' the molecule,   if not then im clueless, good luck, chemistry can be a mission!

Also, 3 hose or Quad hookahs aren't always nice. You might find it annoying to have to bug everyone to plug up their hose every two seconds.     (psst..get a KM)    Well, i hope i helped at least a little! :]|`|PeuFnqQwaa	I would post your question in this forum:    http://www.hookahforum.com    I am sure you will find some people there from NY that would know the answer to your question. May be some other stuff in the forum that interests you as well.

Taking a guess, though:  If what mean is how do you tell which way on the map is north, south, etc., there will be compass points on the map or at least an arrow showing which way is north.  From there, you can figure out the other directions.|`|O9FojdEMaa	north is at the top south at the bottom west on your left and east on the right.

KJHw0oI3aa	You are given 186 g of 10-K gold.  If 42% of it is gold, then you have to take 42% of 186 grams.<br>  <br>  186 g x 0.42 = 78 grams of gold<br>  <br>  Answer:  186 grams of 10-K gold contains 78 grams of gold.|`|luYtFLSUaa	If 10K gold is 42% pure gold the the mass of pure gold in 186g of 10K is given by 0.42 X 186|`|W71scqAlaa	First part is irrelevant.<br>  186g of 10-K, 42% of it is gold.<br>  42% pf 186g = 0.42x186 = 78.1g of pure gold in the 10-K

We really need to see the diagrams to which you are referring.|`|s78ti410aa	1. yes SAS<br>  2.  yes ASA<br>  for the others i need to see the diagram to answer them
AA11707728	Why does it have to be light?<br>  <br>  A great way to do the egg drop experiment is to get a small paint can.  Fill it halfway with jello and harden it in the fridge.  Place the egg inside and fill the rest of the way with jello and harden it.  Then let it come to room temperature with the lid on.  Should weigh about 5 pounds or so.<br>  <br>  From 30 feet it will hit the ground with a sound very much like dropping a cinderblock.  And the egg will be unharmed.<br>  <br>  Pretty dramatic.|`|OqvMI3S6aa	in a cardboard box put cotton in it and throw the egg...I guess
