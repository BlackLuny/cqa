20090128183744AAfLn5q	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Why do people get excited over large tax refunds?	Do people not realize when you get a large tax refund, that means you've been lending money to the government interest free and you could have had that money as an increase to your monthly income?      If you have debt, and you're paying interest on it, why wouldn't you want an extra $100/month vs. $1200 at the end of the year -- which you've been lending interest free?      Pay attention to your taxes, people.  Max out your W-4 exemptions and forecast how much tax you will owe buy using the Form 1040ES which you can get at irs.gov.      But if you like making interest free loans, please send your money to me every month and I'll be happy to give it all back to you next February.

As soon as I moved in we began having a problem with the bathroom drain (literally the day we moved in).  I notified my landlord immediately.  He instructed me to use drano.  I did.  Within a week the drain was completely clogged.  My landlord sent his brother out another week later (he had been the one to install the tub) and he couldn't fix it.  In the process he cut a huge hole behind the kitchen cabinets to get access to the drain.  He also disconnected the drain so that the water drains into the sand under the foundation.  That same week the washer stopped working (again covered in my lease).  I notified him again and he told me he could bring a new one out.  Two weeks later the Temperature drops to 30 degrees outside and I turn on the heat in the house (again A/C and heat covered in the lease)  I call him again.  He tells me he will be out with the washer that weekend and he would look at the heater then.  No show.  Three months later I am fed up.  I spend $50 a week in laundry at a local laundry mat, I have black mold growing under my tub, and I have no heater if it gets cold.  What can I do?

Give everyone big bucks to spend and it trickles down to restart the econemy . if you give every adult . legal taxpayer &1.000.000.00 it would be a lot cheaper than this stimulas package and would get everyone off the tax roles and pay for itself in one year and boost sales of cars, houses and other goods that people need.

But it is an estate property and there are still $400k owed to other people. Since financing is so difficult we worked it out like this:      -He either assumes the current mortgage or barrows enough to pay it off      -He has $400k in cash, and $400k is owed to pay off the estate so that washes out      -that leaves $700k for me to take back as a mortgage note to be paid to me in one year.      My question is what are my risks if he does not pay? The bank would have the first lien so if he defaults can I still assume it and take possesion or does the bank have full control? What else do I have to be concerned about?

20090128171709AAUR6Mo	Business & Finance;Investing	Time value of money question - how do i solve it?	You just started your first job, and you want to buy a house within 3 years. You are currently saving for the down payment. You plan to save $5,000 the first year. You also anticipate that the amount you save each year will rise by 10 percent a year as your salary increases over time. Interest rates are assumed to be 7 percent, and all savings occur at year end. How much money will you have for down payment in 3 years? Draw the time line and specify the location of the cash flows which you calculate as well.   i assume you have 3 cash flows of $5000, $5500, and $6050 but based on the formula that the professor gave us you'd be either adding the least interest to the first PMT, less to the second, and even less to the third - or none at all which makes no sense...   i don't need the answer so much as how to get it

The government has just stole our children's money, and why should we have to pay back money they are taking from us?  Think about it.      It's like a loan shark stealing my money, and then he tells me, that I have to pay back what he's borrowing, by raising my taxes or protection fees.  Now if I don't pay him, then he will break my legs.   You get the picture.      Why not hold and pay no taxes until, the amount borrowed, (stolen) is matched by taxes, not paid, in equal amount.   They borrow 1 trillion, then, until 1 trillion in taxes is not paid by those who it has been stolen from. It should equal out on both sides of the money spectrum.      This way, they don't have to pay it back and we don't have to pay taxes until both sides equal out financially.  Think about it.

Some of the builders in chennai are cheating. I received this news from friends and relatives. Infact I am receiving this news now daily thro my friends.   First Some of the builders in chennai saying   Square feet cost not include   1. Car-Parking   2. Electricity Deposit   3. Metro Water Connection   4. Drainage extra   Suppose I want to purchase a flat around 1000 square feet area say Rs.4500/- per square feet. Then you see this itself Rs.45,00,000/- then you see car-parking is Rs.200000/- Electricity deposit and metro water and drainage is Rs.90000 to Rs.1 lakh then you see flat registration is another Rs.100000/- and above. If things going like this actual flat rate come to Rs.5,500 or even Rs.6,000/- per square feet even in north chennai area. Then you calculate if you are purchasing flat in central chennai or south chennai.      Another thing suppose you pay Rs.10,00,000 as part payment and not yet registered means. Suppose you doesn't want flat in that area. You ask for advance money already given to builder. Some Builders in chennai saying you will get amount after that flat is booked by another party. Unless and until you will not get your amount.      I am asking one question here. If suppose that flat is not booked for another 2 years. What is the interest for that Rs.10,00,000/- . This is huge cheating by some builders.      This work is extra that work is extra. Like "Extras" are going like anything. Common man is highly suffered because of this hidden cost by builders. Common man dream to buy a flats becomes only dream but not reality anymore.      Lot of small builders doing joint venture project and some small projects in chennai say one ground or two ground. Buyers should aware of this builders. Only purchase flat from reputed builders hereafter. Because these small builders have no money. Unless and until some token amount given by some buyers only the builders start construction work. Otherwise they keep idle. Flat buyers given 10 lakhs and 15 lakhs some buyers even give 30 lakhs as advance payment and daily going to builder's office when the work will start asking the same question again and again. This is very sad situation to see.      So beware of this small builders. Invest only with reputed builders or known builders. Don't invest your money with unknown builders anymore.

I've been making music for years and have got good at it, and am faced with a career making dilemma. I currently do AS levels at school and am doing economics, maths, french and philosophy and was aiming to do economics with philosophy at university but have realised that people such as friends and anonymous people online are admiring a lot more and now I'm thinking that the economics choice for uni was a wrong one because I feel that I will not enjoy the career that I get out of it regardless of the money that I receive because I just don't feel I want to live that sort of life style. I would much rather enjoy what I do. So I'm just wondering if I am thinking reasonable here and the choices that I should make if I do choose to go down the music path.

20090225151011AAVvqHy	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Our landlord owes us more than one months rent. What can I do ?	We have lived here for 8 yr & always paid rent on time.  This winter my husband made a verbal agreement to keep her property plowed.     She has paid part of what is due.  This landlord is also known to not pay people she hires.     We figured to trust her and if all else fails, we could hold the rent her.  She specifically asked us not to take it off the rent.  Now the rent is due again and she owes us more than the rent.  Is there a legal way to put the money in an account till she pays us?  So there is not question that the rent is paid.  This is WI (Is the word escrow?)  Does anyone have advice or an idea of where to look for the right answers?

I am going in on Monday to apply and they said, they let me know by next day if I am approved after credit check etc.      My questions are:   1) I dont even know if I have credit because I never owned a credit card but have had debit card with minor overdrawing the account problems. Will I get approved?      2) I am a professional poker player and so don't really have a 9-5 job. Do you think they will care about that as long as I show them the stubs of the cheques I receive when I make money online?      3) If I pay upfront for 2 months' rent, why should they have a problem because it is not like I am not gonna pay cus I am paying upfront?!      My theory is if they have spaces open and if I am paying for it, then would they still deny me?      I am just curious about this whole thing and wanted to get some insight before I go in on Monday to apply.

When we get our income taxes back, he got all the money and didn't give me a dime.      So this year I'm going to file taxes seperate. Anyways last year I paid for school out of my own pocket money. Husband doesn't paid nor support me of going back to school to finish my Associate Degree. So anyways, I got my w2 form, school tution that I paid last year 1098-T form, and etc.       So I got all the paper that I need to file seperate. And I know that I am qualify for the Hope tax credit.       My biggest question is will I get all the money back that i paid for school if I file separate taxes from my husband? To be honest, I haven't work much, I have been only working for less than 6 months.      Now I don't know what to do. If I file joint with my husband I might get everything back that I paid for school and etc. But the thing is, he will use that moneythat get get back from our income taxes to pay back his brother this year. Just like he did last year, instead of paying back his brother he used $2500.00 to paid off his car.      I hate that I never get a dime! Now since I'm working, I'm paying half of the rent, and half of the bills when I only make $8 bucks per hour working at Macys in Texas.  My husband makes $14 bucks per hour.       I don't know what to do! I'm just sick of paying everything in half! My husband doesn't treat me his wife more like a freaking roommate! I work really hard for the money that I paid for school..and knowing that my husband will get all the money from this year taxes will make me angry!

(I'm  having a paper check mailed)      I just checked this evening and the dates are now February 6th-March 6th. My main question is if I had made some mistake or something would they have already told me? I don't want them to let it slide if i did make a mistake and then owe them next year. I'm extremely anxious about that. My other question is will these dates keep changing and getting later? I am staying in a shelter with my son for domestic violence issues and would like to get out on our own asap so i'm extremely impatient this year.

20090128182846AAdAnUQ	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I need some advice with claiming the hope credit for 2008?	Hi I hope someone can help me. So this is whats going on. I started at Western Intenational College for my associates degree in arts and business,in May 2005 and I took a break Jan 2006, because of some financial problems. I started back to school in Feb 2007 at the end of 2007 I claimed my first hope tax credit. I was still going to school I finally recieved my Associates degree in April of 2008. So basically I claimed the hope credit one time. It was a online school and now is the University of Phoenix. I think I would be considered a sophmore. So would I be able to claim the hope tax credit again, because I know you can only claim it twice. I am so confused Please someone help with advice.     Can you please just give me a detail answer. I checked out the IRS website and reviewed there guidelines and I am still undetermined it I can claim it because I didn't actually complete 2 years because in 2005 I didn't go for the whole year and in 2006 I went for 1 month and in 2007 I went for one whole year. So from that I would think yes but not sure.

I've been working at the same place for 6 years and I'm completely taken advantage of.  I never take time off because I feel guilty about not being at work.  If something needs to be taken care of, it is just piled on top of my work load yet I never seem to get a raise.  I work really hard and never get appreciated for it.  Over the years, I've seen how my boss reacts to people giving their notice...and I'm terrified to give mine!  He is rude and inconsiderate and can be down right mean.  To try to cause less emotional stress on both of us, I've thought of telling him that I got a job in my field since i spent thousands of dollars to get a college degree but my friends and family have been telling me to just be honest with him about it.

I was thinking of trying to start a soup and sandwich "cart" at a couple of the local office parks.  My plan was to walk around with a basket of goodies around lunchtime at the office parks close to my home, I used to work at the one I'm think of and would probably hit my old office up first.         I was thinking of offering fresh bread and a couple of different fresh homemade soups,  and a few simple ham & cheese, turkey & cheese, or roast beef & cheese sandwiches on my fresh baked bread to start out with and maybe add some more items later.  I want to keep my start up costs as low as possible until I know if this is a money making idea or not.  I was going to try an start it "under the radar", but I'm also wondering what licenses I might need to do this legitimately?        I'm a stay at home mom, my husband works from home, but the kids take a nap everyday from around 11-2 so I could spend a couple hours a day making a few bucks while they sleep and Dad can continue to work while he keeps an ear out for them.  We are really struggling right now so I'm just trying to think of someway to help out.  I love to cook, I'm always feeding someone anyway, I make a quite a few hearty REALLY good soups with all fresh ingredients, and my bread has been called phenomenal.        Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?       Maybe if you work at an office would you be likely to buy lunch from someone like me, I'm 36, a clean cut,  typical mid western housewife?        And if anyone knows what permits and licenses I should get?      Sorry I'm not interested in ANY other make money from home schemes, just advise on this particular idea would be helpful.  Thank you.

Many high-technology companies, like Nortel Networks, Micron Technology and JDS Uniphase, have written down massive amounts of their inventory. For example, Nortel Networks revalued some of its inventory parts at $0, though the inventory initially cost Nortel $650 million.       Companies are required to report whether they write off the cost value (or book value) or their inventory even if they do not dispose of the inventory. Later on, they may sell this inventory but are not required to report the sale for cash of previously "worthless" inventory. The effect may be that in future years, when the inventory is sold, profits are overstated.      Also in the article, JDS Uniphase said it will write off $250 million of its inventory but promised to disclose any future sale. On the other hand, Micron Technology, which wrote down $260 million, won't disclose any future sale (Krantz, 2001). Should the Securities and Exchange Commission do anything? Why?

It's very confusing so I don't even know if I like it. Basically what my question is is should I go into pharmacy? Like, if youre a pharmacist or in pharmacy school, did you just have a moment when you like knew you wanted to be a pharmacist? Because if you guys tell me I shouldn't be a pharmacist then i dont know what to do, because I don't really have a "passion" or "talent". I'm very smart though, will 102.4 GPA (I'm in 10th grade) and I love math. But I don't hear about jobs that involve math that make a lot of money.

But I  don't want to end up having a low-paying unstable job because I picked some random major, and then regret not going into pharmacy. Please help! If you're a pharmacist, it would help if you told me you weren't 100% pharmacy was for you when you started school.

This job will pay a dollar less an hour, the taxes will take out a 25% chunk of those earnings (washington doesn't tax), it is very short term, and I would have to take the bus and train. To me, this job would mean I could not make ends meet at all. Am I required to accept this job or will I lose my benefits if I choose to continue searching for better employment?
20090128195154AAN04oE	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	My husband hasn't filed please help?	I got married this year, my husband has not filed taxes in the past 14 years or so..apparently his ex-wife screwed his taxes up when they divorced and he had to pay..he then became a horrible alcoholic and didn't file the next year out of spite i guess (?) well, after that he was too scared to file...i know for a fact that for the past 9 years he hasn't made enough to have to file those years..my question is, how do we find out if he owes? he has never received anything from the irs stating he owes anything..i went to irs.gov and couldn't find anything to help us find out...is there any other way to find out?

20090128194050AAdXIeI	Business & Finance;Investing	Wash Sale Rule Question? Please Help?	Does the wash sale rule still apply if you have not traded any stocks in December 08 and January 09.  Example:  I traded ETFC, plus others, multiple times throughout January - June, but have not traded since. Would the wash sale rule still apply to my profit/loss basis?  By the way, I do not own any stock at this time.        I have read on different websites that if you do not have any open positions in the month of December 08 and January 09, the rule would not apply.  I hope you understand the question because I did some reassurance.  Scared to death about filing taxes this year.  Thanks

I know generally it is better for them to claim me since I only make less then 8,000 a year, but last year with the stimulus checks I was wondering if I should have claimed myself, and this year with Obamas tax breaks I was wondering how that would come into play.. plus my friends claim themselves and get a bunch of money for school...

20090128195501AAQoH1S	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Currently Unemployed - should I pay off debt or hold onto my savings?	I was recently let go from my job due to downsizing. I am not sure if I should pay off my debt or continue to hold on to my savings. I owe $21K in debt and have $32K saved. Would like to be "debt-free" but since I am not currently working and looking for another job, should I simply pay off all of my debt and "start fresh" or hold on to my savings and continue to pay monthly on the debts? I have filed for unemployment due to the downsizing and was approved. I will receive $350.00 weekly ($760.00 bi-weekly) for the next 3 - 4 months.       Part of me thinks I should hold on to my savings since we are going through an economic hardship and finding jobs are not as easy anymore. And the other part thinks that I should take the money from my savings and pay off my debt so that I do not have that debt over my head and I can go into the new year "debt-free." What do you suggest?

I read over everything 10 times on the wi revenue website, and I don't think I qualify. But I always do my taxes through turbo tax and it walks me right through the process like I do qualifyfor it.   It says on the WI website that 1 person per houshold may claim the homestead credit and the total household income may not be more than $24,500 or so. There are 3 people that live here and together we do not qualify, but on the Turbo Tax website it doesn't ask any of those questions. The questions it does ask, I do qualify. So O don't know if turbo tax is accurate. They don't answer any of my questions either.   I guess what do you consider a "homestead"? or "household

20090128203306AAMlyMr	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What should I put on my resume to replace the "objective"?	I'm writing my first resume for full time employment.  When I was looking for part-time I had an "objective" stating I'd like to work evenings and weekends. I'm not looking for a job in any specific field, I just need one asap. Probably sales or waitressing (if I end up writing an objective, I don't want to use either specifically, so what could I use to generalize? "To obtain a full time job that enables me...?" to what?)    In my resume template, my name/address/phone number are down the side in a coloured bar, so my objective was first before my job experience/qualifications. I don't want to just jump right into my qualifications at the top of the page, so what could I put to replace my objective?    Thanks :)
