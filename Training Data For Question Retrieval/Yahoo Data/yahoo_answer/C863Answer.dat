A1kiUMgvaa	The bad news is that you can not claim you 22 year old son, given the circumstances you describe.  It is unclear if your mother could either.  For a 22 year old non college student  to be claimed by anyone the kid would have had to live with them all year long and have less than $3,500 of taxable income.|`|VELnLnIKaa	you are not legally entitled to take him as a dependent you are not supporting him|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I'm sorry to hear about your situation, but keep in mind that IRS regulations are heartless. You are not financially supporting your son, so you cannot claim him, end of story. Since he is 22 and is not a full time college student, he would have to live with you all year, and have a gross income of under $3500 in order for you to claim him.|`|QdbaUR51aa	He is 22.

You would have to come to some agreement with your  mother. It is to bad the way things are set up in the tax laws,if you pay just 49% you are out of luck.|`|lrFqu4BTaa	Based on the information provided in your message, you do not qualify to claim the child in question as a dependent.  If I understand the message correctly, he is 22 years old, does not live with you, and you do not support him.

You then transfer amounts as per the instructions to lines 135 to 143  of your T1.<br>  <br>  The Business and Professional Income guide (T4002) is very useful.

5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Yes, I totally agree.  Agents need to step up and put in more effort now that houses take so much longer to sell.  I think the sloppiness is a hold over from the days when you just had to think about selling a house and you immediately had 6 offers in front of you.  When we sold our house I know I really annoyed our agent because I was uber-controlling on which pictures would be taken and used to market our house.  He would have let us leave dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and a car in the driveway if it were up to him.  I also went back to him with changes to the online description that was written and made him update it.  Agents work for sellers, sellers need to demand better work.

Your brother could turn the owner in to the IRS and receive a portion of any funds the IRS recovers.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	No its not right. It happens all the time, but that doesn't make it legal. Legally, your brother should claim the income on his taxes and send in any taxes that he owes. Anything less than that is tax fraud.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	This is a great example of tax evasion. First, the boss should report the revenue on his return. Secondly, he has a legal obligtion to supply the W-2 that is postmarked by Jan 30th. Your brother should report the income on his return. This is going to be sticky since there is no W-2 and he may end up getting the boss in trouble thus causing the business to close.

Bw1h5xAcaa	If all you want to do is work as a nurse in a clinic that serves pediatric patients, you could become an LPN, but you'd be better off becoming an RN, especially if you are looking at being a Nurse Practitioner later on.<br>  <br>  An LPN program is found usually at technical or community colleges or private allied health schools. It can be done in about 12-18 months. <br>  <br>  A Registered Nurse license can be obtained with as little as an Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN), and you can do that at many public community colleges. Some regular 4 year institutions also might offer an ADN option. Otherwise, you can go to a 4 year college or univeristy for a Bachelor of Science or Arts in Nursing (BSN or BAN). <br>  <br>  Both levels of education give you the right to sit for your RN licensure exam. The difference with the BSN programs are that you get more general ed. courses, and the additional nursing courses focus on more in depth nursing theory, models of care, public health, research, and leadership / management / administrative aspects of nursing. With this higher degree you are able to advance more easily into leadership positions beyond staff nursing. And you will need a bachelor's degree to get into a graduate program if you are interested in becoming a Nurse Practitioner, which requires a Master's level (another 2-3 years of school beyond the BSN), and soon will require a Doctor of Nursing Practice in 2015 (I think that's the conversion year). The DNP is an additional 2 years beyond a Master's degree, although some schools have created fast-track BSN to DNP programs which shave about a year off.<br>  <br>  **You can't be any kind of nurse without going through a nursing program, and that means college, and no, you aren't going to like all the courses or think that they necessarily are going to benefit you as a nurse directly, but general education courses / liberal arts courses are meant to enrich your knowledge of humanity, communication, behavior, etc., which all does either directly or indirectly influence your nursing practice.|`|n2VQkiP4aa	I'm not familiar with the area, but you should call a few local colleges and ask them about their programs.<br>  <br>  A quick google search had multiple results, including this (but I'm not sure about the quality, you'll have to figure that out on your own.):<br>  <a href="http://www.ccp.edu/site/academic/degrees/nursing.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccp.edu/site/academic/degrees...</a><br>  <br>  Look through their website, and then call and/or email them (or whatever schools you're interested in) and ask some questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
ikXRqWxUaa	if you want to buy things from ebay or other merchants that take paypal, it's very very worth it.  i have bought tons of things using paypal and never once have i had an issue.  there are fees involved with it, but they are not in the initial setup (they are after all, a business in it to make money).  the good thing about paypal is that you have an additional layer of protection of an unscrupulous seller tries to jerk you by not shipping your merchandise or shipping you a lemon.  simply report the incident to paypal and 9 times out of 10, you will get your money back.|`|vVka4ZA0aa	I've used paypal for a number of services, and honestly, I've NEVER had a problem. I've never had to deal with theft issues or anything like that.<br>  Like any service though, you do want to read the fine print. If you're using paypal for things like ebay, it's very simple to use and I don't believe it costs anything. If it does, it's certainly not much.<br>  But selling things on your own website can get pricey, but that's with any service.|`|COhYuTj3aa	Do it.  It doesn't cost anything to set up.   Paypal pretty much sets the standard for online purchases these days.   Do it.|`|tp7gQ4imaa	Honestly, they are devious in their practices and have many stealthy fees. If setting up an online shop use Google Checkout or Yahoo's Ecommerce solution|`|auegTf2iaa	I agree with Joe from MN|`|4HoVVCenaa	I use it all the time to buy and sell on eBay. I just recently used it to place a car ad. There are two levels, I think. My level does not allow them access to my credit card, therefore I have to deposit money (electronically from my bank) from time to time. It works like a checking account.
RkfIPD7Iaa	THey did have until the end of Feb to send the receipt, and they apparently did that.  It's not their responsibility to ensure you RECEIVE the receipt, since they have no control on that.<br>  <br>  They are correct that they cannot send a duplicate receipt until mid March, but that is in plenty of time for you to file by late April.|`|kGJND4lYaa	They have until the end of February to send them out, which they did. <br>  <br>  You, on the other hand, have until April 30 to file your taxes, so not having the receipt until mid-March will work just fine.
eYFRKmPOaa	Are you asking for someone to attend or asking for information. If you are asking for information, be careful attending a sales presentation. You must be strong and say no. Additionally, do not give them too much information. Let them know that you know you are only required to attend for 90 minutes and that you are there for the free gift. Normally, big gifts are for buyers and drawing. Go to Timeshare Advocacy Internationals site and look at the blog articles on this topic.
ePkiOzPSaa	Generally no, it may give you some idea, and it may be right on target, but more often than not it's wrong.  This is an appraisal that can be pretty inaccurate to begin with, and just gets worse as time passes, changes are made to the house, and the real estate market changes.  To get an accurate value of your house you will need to hire an appraiser.|`|AA11173563	Alter is correct. Most county governments send an appraiser to do drive by appraisals and they determine value based on public records and comparable sales in your area about every 5 years or so. Then you are taxed on that value. If you believe it to be high then have a full appraisal done and take it to the county office and see if they will lower your taxes due|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No thank goodness but they are moving toward true market value. You need to contact the town tax assessor and ask.  it may also say on your bill how that amount was arrived at|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Not typically.  When you first purchase a house, the tax assessors will normally adjust the value to match the purchase price - and then leave it alone until they get around to assessing it again - this may be years down the road during which it may increase or decrease in price.<br>  <br>  You can request a new assessment if a private appraiser determines that it is worth less.  Actually you can request it anytime - but when the tax assessor says it's worth more, you will owe more in taxes - so it's not generally a good idea :-)<br>  <br>  If you want to know the current value, find a private appraiser.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	It's what your county, city, or town's tax assessors think it's worth. This can be *dramatically* different from what you'd be able to ask for the house if you were trying to sell it.<br>  <br>  This is nothing new. It's been this way at leasts since I've been buying and selling houses (since the 1970s), and probably for a long time before that.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	No. Your tax statement is based on a levy figure to calulate what taxes are.  Current market values are based on current sales of similar properties in the area.  Nowadays, it's not uncommon to see a sale that is lower than tax value.
eNPcNGSjaa	You would do things like order office supplies and file paper work as well as answer phones.  I don't think it would be overwhelming, it just allows you to put more responsibilities on your resume.  Having more responsibilities make your work days fly, sitting at a desk all day greeting visitors is very mundane and gets very boring very quickly.<br>  <br>  If it were going to be too much work, the company would split the job up between more than just one person.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	i've been working in their field for 6 or 7 years - at first it is overwhelming (when you do not have experience) - after awhile its all just second nature to you.  <br>  <br>  Do whatever makes you comfortable|`|29ZL58Xjaa	It really depends.

rrp9c2tnaa	First check with some of your local business organizations and see if they have a speakers circle.  These would be a group of people who are registered with the circle as experts on various topics, then you pick the topic you are looking for.

They can only be involved, though, if the seminar is free to the public.<br>  <br>  Other places to check would be local Lions or Rotary Clubs, your Chamber of Commerce, and other civic organizations.

Look into a payment arrangement, or temporarily lowering the apr so you can get back on track, promotional rates, balance transfers, etc. <br>  <br>  Credit card companies can only stay in business if you use your card.

I'm not sure how deep a hole you are in, but the best thing to do is call each CC company and claim you have been fired or laid off.

Employing a debt management company can decrease your credit score and also prevent you from being approved for loans and credit cards in the future.

4f3GfrN6aa	If your husband is a bit of a financial loser and can't control his spending, then it's best you keep savings from him.  You are both responsible for the welfare of the family.  So play to your strengths.  You are protecting your family from the danger of being destitute.  I think in your situation, what you are doing is perfectly rational and legitimate.  <br>  <br>  If your husband is not financially responsible, that puts the family at risk.  So you need to protect the family's financial welfare, and by stashing some cash, you are doing exactly that.  <br>  <br>  If your husband was an alcoholic, and you had a bottle of vodka hidden in the toilet cistern where he'd never look, because it would harm him (he would be unable to restrain himself from drinking it, and potentially do something he later regretted) it would be the same.  Or if your husband was a recovered heroin addict, and you had a medical condition that required you to be on opiate drugs, it would protect him to conceal the presence of those drugs from him.<br>  <br>  Your husband is unable to protect himself from his bad habits, or is unwilling to learn.  So you have to do the right thing.  You are protectively withholding information that could result in him accessing that money and spending it, leaving you with nothing when you have an emergency.<br>  <br>  If I was in your situation, I would do exactly the same thing. It's not like you are concealing the money from him in order to harm him.  For example, if you were planning on hiring a hitman to kill your husband, or leave him for another man, and you were saving for that, then that would be morally reprehensible.  But you are saving for your family's best interests.  That is the right thing to do.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	If he is not responsible enough, then don't tell him. One day when you need it, he will be pleasantly surprised. I hope. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have decided to keep our accounts separate and not open one jointly because of similar reasons. I am more responsible than he is, and I'm afraid if he had access to all that I sacrificed for and have worked so hard to save, that he may spend it on frivolous things. He's the type to say "oh what's $15 here? or $30 there?" and that all adds up! I don't want him thinking we have more money than he knows about.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that I think it's right to keep things from your husband, but so long as you are not being stingy or plotting against him with it, it's actually probably in both of your best interest.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure your husband keeps a secret or two from you, too.|`|Q5E2s3R5aa	Shhhhh.

I would do it too if I were you.|`|CM0C65dtaa	I don't think it is wrong to save some without your husband knowing, but that is a pretty significant amount.

vVka4ZA0aa	Well, it depends. Do you currently have any balances on credit cards? If you do, pay it off ASAP! And by ASAP, I mean right now. lol<br>  Then, I can't guarantee that this will work, but say you have $100 and you plan on going shopping. Instead of using your $100, use your credit card, then as soon as your purchases show (within your grace period) use your $100 to pay it off. Get it? Just try to do this every month.|`|AA11173563	we have no idea as we do not know what is reporting. You can try. pay off or settled all old debt and get current credit cards down to less than 30% of the available limit|`|7QPv7ta7aa	It is unlikely that you can raise your score than much in such a short period, especially if you have negative items on your credit report.  Typically you have to have at least 24 months of consistent, on time payment history to see any kind of improvement in your score.<br>  <br>  If you are carrying any balances on existing credit cards,  pay them all off.  Carrying balances of more than 30% hurts your score, paying them off will give your score a quick boost.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any credit cards, get one even if you have to go with a secured card.   Using a credit card and paying it in full every month will build good payment history.|`|COhYuTj3aa	No way.  I used to be a credit analyst for a leasing bank.   This can't be done.  Sorry.  The quickest action you can take are the following:  apply for 3 credit cards, get approved, cut the cards up and never use them when they come in the mail.  This improves your available debt ratio.   Next, hop on equifax.com and pull your report.  File a dispute with all negative ranking information and that will at least temporarily remove items affecting your score negatively.  Generally, it would take at least a year (and this smoking fast) for a score to improve 100 pts.  Good Luck.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	The same way you always do - have one credit card, put on $50-$100 each month and pay it off each month. <br>  <br>  However, credit is hard to build yet easy to destroy.

Do you have bad credit, no credit, did you file for bankruptcy?<br>  <br>  For the sake of argument, I'll assume you have bad credit and can't get a card.<br>  <br>  First, you'll want to remove as many negative items from your credit as possible.  Anything your creditors or collection agencies fail to verify as accurate must be deleted.  It's the law.  So dispute any item that appears inaccurate.  If you know an item to be accurate, but you're not sure of the detail, then question the details you're not 100% certain of.<br>  <br>  Then you need to build your credit.  Have a family member add you as an authorized user. Make sure the card they add you on has a perfect history, high limit, and low balance.  <br>  <br>  Finally, go here and buy a couple tradelines:<br>  <a href="http://uneedtosee.com/this/deal" rel="nofollow">http://uneedtosee.com/this/deal</a><br>  <br>  They have a 100% approval rate and report to all 3 bureaus.|`|6RShftELaa	It is very possible and I can do it for you.

JXJvxhZPaa	1. To see if we have overpaid or underpaid taxes.  Usually when you are an employee, you have tax money withdrawn from your paycheck.  You file for taxes to make sure you have paid the right amount.<br>  2. Not necessarily.  You only get money back if too much money is withheld from your paycheck.<br>  3. If you didn't work last year, you don't need to file.<br>  4. You shouldn't owe them any money.|`|AA11173563	did you work? or have any income like interest income? if so that may be the case it has nothing to do with credit cards|`|zuGKIWfNaa	You owe the government money if you earned income yourself and your employer didn't hold out enough of your pay for withholding.<br>  <br>  People get money back if their employer has held out more for the government than they actually owe.<br>  <br>  Did you work last year? How much was your income? How much did your employer keep out for withholding taxes?<br>  <br>  Another possibility -- since you mention your "father's accountant" -- do you have other sources of income, such as interest on bank accounts, or dividends from stocks? If so, you have to pay some taxes on those. That might be the reason you owe.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	When you owe them money its because the Government did not take out enough taxes from your pay check , so you got over paid.  They are not collecting it.  <br>  <br>  A credit card has nothing to do with your taxes its based on the income that you made working.  Maybe you need to adjust your w-2's at where you work.  <br>  <br>  Also you should pay it as fast as you can you do not want that to increase with fees for not paying.|`|ug00j0S8aa	1.  Any government needs money to operate.  Most of that money comes from taxes.  One kind of tax is a tax on income.  People who have income file a report (their income tax return) each year to say how much their income was, how much they already paid, calculate how much they owe, and if they paid too much, get the extra back, if they paid too little, pay the rest.<br>  <br>  2.  Most people seem to get money back, which means they gave the government too much during the year.<br>  <br>  3.  No, your spending would have nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  4.  If you had over $900 of "unearned" income (interest, some dividends), you would owe taxes.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	If you didn't work in 2008 then you MUST have had some taxable income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.  That's the only way that you'd owe any money at filing time.<br>  <br>  Look at your tax return.  It will show how much taxable income you have and how much the tax was.  Normally with unearned income no taxes are withheld from it, so you have to pay when you file.|`|AA12066612	1. We file for taxes to ensure we are paying the correct amount of taxes based on your tax bracket. Also what you choose to have withheld from your pay check determines how much you get back or how much you owe. For example, I fill out my W-4 and choose a certain withholding and I elect another 5 dollars from my pay check. End of the year I had 700 dollars taken by the government, I do my taxes and my tax bracket determines I am in the 10% bracket, so I owe say 350$. So the government pays me the other 350$.<br>  2. Getting money back is totally dependent upon how much you withhold, too much and you get money, too little and you owe. Other factors vary whether you take out retirement/stocks, have dependents, work in another state, there is a list.<br>  3. If you did not earn more than 3000$ of income for the tax year, you do not have to file your tax return. As someone mentioned above, if you have financial trusts, bonds, stocks, interest in your name that were cashed I can see why you might owe, but if you had those 192 would be nothing to you. Having a credit card has nothing to do with your taxes, unless its business related. If also you are 17, your father should be claiming you as a dependent, in which case the only way you would be filing a return is if you had earned income.<br>  4. Sounds like your father's accountant sucks, or you are not privy to some information about your financial situation. One of two can be resolved, get the facts.

The person who provided that answer actually gives very good answers here. His phrasing was perhaps a bit harsh, but there's a difference between making a "foolish decision" and being a fool. Even smart people make some dumb decisions.<br>  <br>  I agree, though: The answer wasn't responsive to your question. The other answer, advising you to contact an attorney, was good.<br>  <br>  Sometimes those of us who answer a lot of questions do wonder why some people did what they did. I just answered a question here from someone who was handed an agreement which he admits he didn't read, didn't understand, and wasn't explained to him. Yet he signed it. Now he wants to know whether it's binding. Sometimes you just wonder: "What was he thinking?" Your case, from your other question, sounded fairly complicated. And if I'd read it when you posted it, my first reaction would be be: Contact a lawyer. And my second reaction would be: I hope he has some written documentation on all this.<br>  <br>  Feel free to give anyone (the other answerer, me, anyone) a thumbs down if you feel an answer isn't responsive to your question.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

IRC 988 applies to cash forex unless the trader elects to opt out.<br>  <br>  Under Section 1256, forex traders can have a significant advantage over stock traders. By reporting capital gains on IRS Form 6781 (Gains and Losses from Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles), forex traders are allowed to split their capital gains on Schedule D using a 60% / 40% split. This means that 60% of the capital gains are taxed at the lower, long-term capital gains rate (currently 15%) and the remaining 40% at the ordinary or short-term capital gains rate, which depends on the tax bracket the trader falls under (as high as 35%). This results in an average rate of 23%, which is 12% less than the regular (short-term) rate.<br>  <br>  Companies that profit from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates as part of their normal course of business, fall under Section 988. This means their gains and losses from foreign exchange (such as buying and selling of foreign goods) are treated as interest income or expense and get taxed accordingly. Consequently, they do not receive the beneficial 60/40 split. <br>  <br>  Since forex traders are also exposed to daily exchange rate fluctuations, their trading activity falls under the provisions of Section 988 too.  Because these daily fluctuations can be considered part of a currency trader's assets in the normal course of his business, the IRS gives the trader the option of rejecting (opting out) of Section 988 and electing that the gains be taxed under the favorable 60/40 split of Section 1256. <br>  <br>  What do you have to do to opt out of Section 988? Even though you don't have to file anything with the IRS to opt out, you are required to do so "internally" before starting to trade; i.e., you must keep records in your own books about the fact that you are opting out of Section 988.<br>  <br>  Many currency traders bend the rules by waiting after the year is over to see if they have any gains from their trading activities. If they do, they claim that they elected out of IRC 988 to enjoy the beneficial Section 1256 treatment. On the other hand, if the sum of the trades from cash forex is not positive, they stick with the traditional Section 988. <br>  <br>  Forex traders should receive 1099 forms from their US-based broker at the end of the year like stock and futures traders do. No matter in what country your forex broker is based or what tax-related reports they provide, you could pull up reports online from your accounts and seek the help of a tax professional. No matter what you decide to do, don't fall into the temptation of lumping your trades with your section 1256 activity (if any). Forex transactions need to be separated into Section 988 reporting.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|KhXpHYfuaa	In Turbo Tax 2008, you want to select "Less Common Income" then "Miscellaneous Income"  It'll then give you a list of Misc Income sources to choose from.

5ta5yyWSaa	If your card expires in February, it will be the last day of the month. You should get a new card about 30 days before that unless it was closed, not used for more than 1 year and not reissued or lost in the mail. If you don't get the card (and they come in unmarked envelopes) call customer service. The old card should be destroyed.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	About a month before the card expires, the credit card company will send you a new card.  It's automatic and you don't have to do anything.

Rmj8Judgaa	spread trading occurs in all markets, futures, options, and stocks, etc.  basically you are taking the position that the difference in prices between two investment items will either increase or decrease.  you will buy the one you expect to gain (relative to the other) and sell the one that you expect to lose (relative to the other).  in this way it does not matter if both go up or down in price as long as the spread or difference between the two items moves in your direction.  there are many different types of spreads you might trade depending on your view of the market and your risk tolerance.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|ww12lItvaa	I think that is not the "spread" you are hearing about. <br>  <br>  I think what you are wondering about is buying or selling an option above and below the current price of a stock and the difference is your spread.<br>  <br>  No need to yell.|`|AA12219135	I used to trade the spread between short and long term bond futures.<br>  BOBL and Bund<br>  the spread would normally travel at .130<br>  If it got too wide, short the top and buy the lower until the gap narrowed, basically netting a profit on the closing of the spread.<br>  Opposite if the spread was to narrow, short the lower and buy the top<br>  <br>  Some feel it's a more guaranteed profitable trade.<br>  To me, it was sort of nerve wracking|`|I1VivZxfaa	If you are referring to Option Spread Trading, this is a strategy performed on the same exchange where you simultaneously Buy and Sell related Options.  Note: selling is not buying a put, but writing an option.  <br>  <br>  There are credit spreads and debit spreads and there are a host of spread strategies.<br>  <br>  An example (note, I am making up the numbers) of a vertical credit spread will be : <br>  Buy Call 85 POT March 09 Option for 2.8 (debit)<br>  Sell Call 80 POT March 09 Option for 3.1 (credit)<br>  <br>  You get a net credit of .30 per 100 shares (ie. 1 contract).  With this you are basically betting that the price of POT will be above roughly 81.9 (this figure isn't accurate, I'm just using broad estimations).  If today's price is 82.50, you can actually make money if the stock drops in price a little bit or if the price goes up.  <br>  <br>  It's not difficult if you understand options, but complicated to explain unless you know the basics of options first.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.<br>  <br>  ps. I am doing my own survey that given today's financial market situation, would providing a stock and options (which primarily focuses on directional and vertical spread trading) information alert service be of interest to people today, especially since there are so many expensive competitors doing the same?

ffHcbUeLaa	The stimulus is not the magic wand that will fix the economy, and the government is expanding its reach in many industries.  There are fears that big banks like Citibank and Bank of America would be nationalized - as mentioned by Senator Dodd, another Democrat.  Usually our government entities do not have shareholders, so these shares would be worthless.  Plus honestly, have you ever seen any government managed entity that is running lean and efficiently, making lot's of profit???  The Democratic government usually just multiplies bureaucracy and then asks for more tax dollars because costs reach the sky in another universe.  Mr. Obama's Democratic government sees no problems expanding the government (at taxpayer's costs) so hopefully in four years our country will not be a deja vu of USSR or other communist government that owns and/or controls everything in America, and needs more and more money from us, the hardworking Americans.<br>  <br>  I expect the Dow to slide a bit more before it starts climbing again steadily - and this is due to uncertainty of the market.|`|DLjhWN58aa	im not a stock expert but right now the sentiment in Wall Street is that many big Corporations and Banks are about to be nationalized. And Wall Street doesn't want that. Nationalizing banks will basically wipe out investors of those companies. This further sends more negative reactions from investors of those troubled companies. Just imagine, if you own CitiBank stocks.....and it is poised and rumoured to be bought over by the government......wouldnt you sell your shares before anything happens? <br>  <br>  besides, even after signing bills after bills worth billions and billions of dollars.......unemployment are still rising, retailers are still closing, housing prices are still descending. If you were an investor - even if obama signs trillion upon trillions upon trillions of dollars of bailouts, and unemployment data, retailers closing and descending housing prices...........would you still believe the bailout would work? of course you would sell your holdings.<br>  <br>  anyways, i think no matter what obama does, the stock market will only recover once these economic datas i mentioned above gets better.<br>  <br>  thats my two cents.|`|0HZMpkKXaa	If you took out millions of unsecured loans, how much would you be worth? big negative numbers.

92gcQFTIaa	I've been selling for over 6 years and on my items I state that payment MUST be made within 3 days.  I do this because there are so many people that tinker around and don't pay for weeks.  After the 3 days I send a reminder every few days and after the 7th day I place a dispute against the buyer.  Here's how it REALLY works: by eBay rules you cannot start a dispute against the customer for 7 days.  Once the dispute is started then the customer has 7 MORE days to pay from that point before you can close the dispute and get your Final Value Fee back.  If they do not pay then they can get a negative strike against them and after a few strikes it's hard for them to buy from anyone for a few months.  <br>  <br>  Basically some people pay within minutes and other put it off and sometimes they just disappear.  Just send them email reminders, but be friendly.|`|Uu7BeMF2aa	3 to 5 business days.  If you want the payment sooner for future listings, you should specify in your listing how long the buyer has to send payment.|`|PN7XMglOaa	72 hours|`|3vwBR9udaa	If they don't pay or contact you in 48 hours, just send them an email that says "Congratulations!  I have your item packed up and ready to ship, just let me know when you have sent the payment and I will have it out the door!"  That always works for me.<br>  <br>     Worst case scenario, if they haven't paid in a week and haven't contacted you, you can file an Unpaid Item Reminder.  It sounds harsh, but the first email is just an email reminder for them to pay.  The difference is, it actually comes from eBay so it generally works well.<br>  <br>     If they don't pay after that, then they get an Unpaid Item Strike and then you get your fees refunded.  Then either relist it, or give a Second Chance offer to the person that they outbid.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Thus, when X Company loses 15% in a year but the industry the company is in loses 20% on average, then the executive is due a bonus.  Most industries lose money at some times in a business cycle.  They get paid for outperforming the competition.  CEO's, like basketball superstars, do something that very few people in the world can do.  It just doesn't look like it when they are demonized by the press and leftists.
16936ed4ea4132161e639675db892b56aa	As a new employee you are worthless.  You have to work there for many months before you earn your pay.  Sure, you can get paid for working, but if you are not a positive influence on others, you are costing them money.<br>  <br>  So you hate your job at the grocery store?  Have you talked to the managers and assistants telling them you will do anything?  Have you asked them if you can enroll in the management training program?<br>  <br>  No?  I did not think so.<br>  <br>  You will find that restaurants have some of the hardest workers out there.  I presume you are applying as waitstaff and not some support position.  Waiters get paid didly but earn $$ if they earn it in tips.<br>  <br>  <br>  You did not detail where the person that got hired over you came from.  Did they come from another store?  Does he have more experience than you?  Why should they cut quality to fulfill a promise to a guy that gets his feelings hurt so much.<br>  <br>  If you hate your job, leave.  There are two or more people that will work harder than you.<br>  <br>  If you want to work for a restaurant, do so.  If you are concerned about pay, then do not leave.  <br>  <br>  How do you negotiate pay as a "entry level"?  you take what they offer you and learn every aspect of the business as fast as you can.  You work 60 hours a week even though you only get paid for 40.  You learn how to cook, how to prep, how to bus tables, how to run the dishwasher, how to run the vacuum cleaner, how to scrub toilets, how to load the ice machine, how to work the bar, how to shop for emergency supplies, how to roll silverware, how to pour a beer, how to mix a drink, how to fill out the schedule, how to do every job there is in the place.  Then you ask for a raise.  If they do not give it to you, go to work somewhere else.  That is how you earn increases in pay.<br>  <br>  This may sound harsh, but I have walked in your shoes and followed my own advice.  Now, I get to goof off and post answers here.

pWlVHm6kaa	Suicide is a little drastic.<br>  You are paying and getting charged - probably a ridiculously high penalty and fee as well as a default interest rate. It's likely they haven't been able to get hold of you via phone. One 30 day late isn't enough to totally screw your credit rating. They can reconsider opening the account again when you get your finances under control. <br>  <br>  For right now, call them and tell them what is going on. There may be some way they can help you. Speak to a manager. Ask the manager what you can do to get this account back on track. If you talk to them and stay in touch, they won't ding your credit report as badly. The things that you can talk about are how long it will take and what kind of payments they would need, once you're working, to lower your interest rate to under the default rate. Usually, it's 3-6 months of regular payments. <br>  <br>  Talk to the bank that is administering your student loans. If you're unemployed, underemployed, or part time, you may qualify for a deferment. You can defer for 3 years if you need to as long as you stay on top of it and renew it every year. You can also opt to pay your loans based on your current income. You can extend the term of the loan and consolidate loans as well. They will give you a forbearance for up to 90 days to get your paperwork together for a consolidation, for example, or for deferment. <br>  <br>  Get your bills together and call each and every one of them. Figure out what is necessary and what is a luxury. Cut off everything that you do not absolutely need. Examine each account and find out if there are any that have better offers. I did this with ATT and found out that because I have U-verse, ATT Internet, and a wireless account, I qualified for free long distance and a $7. a month discount on my home phone. They also gave me 6 months of Showtime for free as long as I cancel in 6 months and advised me that I should find out what specials they have at that time because there may be a similar 6 month free special for HBO. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the thing is, you have to stop feeling bad about this. You're one of many millions experiencing the economic downturn. You're not paying because times are tough and not from some internal flaw. The best thing you can do is to keep your creditors informed. You *will* find a job soon. It use to take about 6 months after graduation to find work. Now, it's more like 8 to 12 months. So hang in there!|`|fF1WbPltaa	First thing to do is contact the credit card people and explain your position to them.

You will be expected to pay off any money that you still owe.<br>  <br>  The thing about credit is that it changes up and down over time.  Your score can't be permanently damaged.  Even foreclosure only stays on your report for 10 years, and bankruptcy for 7.<br>  <br>  You won't be sued, at least not for a long time.  If you owe money and you don't make regular payments, the debt would be sent to a collections agency, and they would call you and send you letters.  If you just refused to pay, they could sue you and garnishee your paychecks.  But you wouldn't go to jail or anything unless you commit fraud.<br>  <br>  Credit card companies are kind of evil.  They make more money off fees than they do off interest payments, so they seem to prefer it when you make late payments or go over your limit.<br>  <br>  Just take a breath and call the credit card company.  You can make payment arrangements with them.  You can also apply for a new card from a different provider.  The best thing, though, is to try to cut your expenses and stay off credit.  The danger in spending money you don't have is that you can get in over your head and have trouble paying it off.  But this happens to lots of people.  If you stay on a budget and pay off this debt, you'll be fine before you know it.<br>  <br>  If you don't already have a roommate, consider getting one so you can save on rent.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|ob3WOb5saa	It just means they aren't going to extend anymore credit to you.

Hang in there.  Things will turn around for you and you will be back on your feet in no time.  After all, its just a credit card and you have the rest of your life to get another one.

Late payment attracts a fee as does exceeding your credit limit.  A good rule is to never allow your available credit to fall below $50 - don't go right to your limit.<br>  You will not get sued, but I am rather surprised your account was closed rather than merely being suspended until you had paid what was requested.  Closure usually occurs only if you are persistently late with payments at the same time as exceeding your credit limit.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You are no longer allowed to use the card.<br>  <br>  You must continue making the payments until the balance reaches zero.  If you continue making all required payments on time and in the required amounts, you will not be sued.  If you stop paying, you might be sued.<br>  <br>  Once you find a job, you may wish to pay more than the required amounts, so that the balance goes down and the amount that they charge for interest is reduced.<br>  <br>  A credit card account being closed does not ruin your credit.  However, missing payments and going over your limit (what you are calling being overdrawn, although that is technically incorrect) does damage your credit.

RqQDKEVHaa	First, for your own benefit, do NOT rely on the listing agent. You need your own agent. You're trying to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  I have no idea why those agents aren't calling back. They should be. Some agents--those who became agents from 2002 to about 2006--just learned some pretty bad habits. You'd list a house, and it'd immediately sell. You didn't have to return phone calls or respond to e-mails. Many of those agents are exiting the profession now.<br>  <br>  Rather than doing it hit-and-miss, search for a good buyer's agent. Someone who will return calls. Someone who'll be on the constant lookout for properties that fit your needs. It's sometimes more difficult finding good buyer's agents than good listing agents. You can find good listing agents by driving around a neighborhood and seeing which agents dominate the area. Or by scanning community newspapers and seeing which agents have the most listings. It doesn't necessarily mean they're good, but that's a starting point.<br>  <br>  Buyer's agents can be different. Some agents prefer to represent sellers; others prefer to represent buyers. And some are willing to do both.<br>  <br>  You might start by identifying the 3-4 top real estate offices/firms in your area. Call each and ask to speak to the "managing broker." That's the boss. You don't want to speak to the agent who answers the phone. When you get to the managing broker, explain briefly what you're looking for. Ask for his recommendations for 2 or 3 of his best buyer's agents. Get that information.<br>  <br>  You may then end up with 10-12 suggestions from the real estate offices. Call each and leave a message if you need to. Ideally, you'll get all 10-12 to call you back. More likely, it'll be slightly less. Talk to each about your needs. From the phone conversations, narrow down your list to 3-4 who seem to be the best fit. Then meet in person with each of them. Decide which one seems the best fit for you. Then sign a buyer's agreement with that one. Keep the time period reasonable--3-6 months, no longer. You can always re-sign if they're doing a good job.<br>  <br>  That's a good way to find an agent to represent you.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Many advertisements are for houses that have already sold.

Craigslist.com has tons of homes for sale.<br>  <br>  Once you pin down the number of rooms you need, and especially the area, square footage and price range you can get a home loan for (call a lender and get pre-approved), the agent representing the house will gladly show it to you when you arrive.  Simply schedule an appointment in advance.  If you love a particular home, and THAT agent is not calling you back... leave a note on the door or in the mailbox for the OWNER and tell them you might want to buy the home... and the owner will surely contact you!<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Finding a good home only takes few hours, if you have interenet access.  Obviously you have access... that's why I'm reading your post.

This would give the government ownership of the banks.

Is this what we want?  I sure hope not.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	That depends.<br>  I think it is better to nationalize a failing bank than to leave thousands of people w/o thier assets, which is why the FDIC exists. So, if the government is going to insure the deposits of people in a failing bank, why would nationalizing the bank before things get that far be a bad thing?<br>  Of course we wouldn't want the financial system in the hands of the government long term, but nationalizing to assure an orderly break-up and prevent fraud, then selling the assets back to the private sector in time can make good sense.<br>  See the swedish financial crisis of the recent past.|`|634jf1L4aa	Bad thing.  The more banks are nationalized and government takes control of business the more socialist our nation becomes.  Privatization leads to more incentive.  China nationalized everything and finally they are letting people privatize and that's why their economy is booming.

I1VivZxfaa	I agree in principle with J. M. but have a few important modifications.<br>  <br>  The key difference to J.M.'s well thought out email is in 3 aspects : <br>  1. Index Funds are cheaper because only 4% (this is a statistical fact in many studies) chance for a fund manager to beat an index because of the costs of transactions and the cost of hiring a manager who has very little chance of guessing the correct timing to buy a stock.<br>  <br>  2. As an alternative to Vanguard's Index funds, you should buy ETFs.  This is much more liquid than Index Funds and cheaper (there's a tax benefit to this).   Indices are basically a basket of stocks that a company puts together.  So in effect its a portfolio of stocks.  You can buy a portion of this basket of stocks through ETFs.  SPY is based on the S&P, you can buy overseas, such as FXI (China), commodity such as GLD (Gold), etc.<br>  <br>  3. If your investment horizon is long, and you wish to invest in the market, pick a broad based index (probably SPY may be a good one, if you like the US markets) and Dollar Cost Average In your Investment.  This basically means taking your total amount to be invested and divide it by lets say 12.  Then for the next 3 years, every 3 months buy the amount of shares of the same ETF (exchange traded fund) by using the same Dollar amount (not the same number of shares).  This guarantees that your entry price will be reasonable and "averaged."  So no need to worry about if the price when up or down or other.  <br>  <br>  You are good to go.<br>  <br>  Happy to see a young in doing this. Also  show your mum and dad my note about ETFs and J.M's view about the fees with mutual funds.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  ps. Anyone that is reading this answer....I am doing my own survey that given today's financial market situation, would providing a stock and options (which primarily focuses on ETFs and directional and vertical spread trading) information alert service be of interest to people today, especially since there are so many expensive competitors doing the same? If you are happy to share your views, kindly let me know|`|AA10247168	Right now the answer is to leave your money in a fixed investment account. Continue to invest into the fixed account until such time the market settles out [a year or two].  At that point you should invest in a mutual fund which invest in long term growth. Do your research on various web sites, read the prospectus and remember during a long term investment strategy there will be "big" ups and downs, just hold on.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	I don't have the best answer for you on this one, however, I will gice the opposite of what you said.... I AM VERY IMPRESSED that you're actually thinking about this at 15.  Good job!  I'm 28 and wish I did the same about 10 or 12 years ago.  I would say though because of your age, invest into high risk markets, because you are young enough where if you take a big hit in the market, you have plenty of time to make it up... as you get older, lower your risk factor in the market.  I recommend looking into a high percentage IRA.  You wont be able to touch the money for a long time, but when you can years down the road, you should be set.|`|X3wHGhyWaa	Invest in foreign markets and you ll be rich when you get to 25<br>   or put that 2K in a Commodity fund....and it will do just fine.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	I would recommend investing in the Vanguard Group of index mutual funds. <br>  <br>  Here's why:  Three quarters of mutual funds don't earn any more money than if they invested in the S&P 500 stock market index. In other words, 75% of the managers could not pick better specific "winners" than an investor passively holding a basket of the 500 largest public U.S. companies. The managers could pick specific stocks which would do as well as picking the 500 largest stocks (essentially doing as well as random chance would dictate), but the cost to pay their expenses, as well as the high taxes incurred through active trading, resulted in actually underperforming the index.<br>  <br>  So why pay load fees for managers who do no better than random chance?<br>  <br>  If you invest in the Vanguard 500 fund -- an extremely low-cost mutual fund that would not attempt to beat the returns of the stock market as measured by Standard & Poor's 500 index instead, it would attempt to mirror the index as closely as it could by buying each of the index's 500 stocks in amounts equal to the weightings within the index itself -- your money will grow as long as the U.S. economy grows.<br>  <br>  And over any substantial length of time, I'd place my bets on the growth of the U.S. economy.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Go to Fidelity.com and look at the different mutuals available.

qNVP4Q1Saa	Contract is a contract. If there was a fully executed contract then you will have received your own copy. That copy will not have any erasure and that is your proof.  I have never heard of a separate commission contract and I cannot imagine what the need would have been since each and every listing agreement has a specific defined area for the commission to be detailed. Detailed with the co broke amount, for non agency and buyer agency disclosed dual agency and so on. I cannot imaging why any agent would list a house for 2%. It would not be worth the time and makes no sense logically. The agency must co broke for at least 2% so there is nothing left in that event. If it was that agents buyer than sometimes that can be done at a reduced interest as much as half. That would be in the original contract as well.  That document will have to be reviewed.  The Listing Agreement is one document. That document is the instrument that will decide commission as seen by the closing attorney. You can call the broker or call the closing attorney directly.  There is no way that anyone is going to be able to provide you any answer to your question without reviewing the documents.|`|AA11173563	call his broker on this and if he is a broker report him to the real estate board in your state|`|EXJfoGtAaa	What was your reason for the side contract?  And apparently your offer of 2% was buried in the fine print.  Did you honestly think he would take a 2% listing when he has to offer a reasonable commission to a cooperting office?  I think you are the shady one.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|ikXRqWxUaa	ditto what everyone else said.  that side contract is going to make his broker much less likely to help you as it will look like you were trying to cut a scag deal with the realtor on the side.  <br>  <br>  as the other person said, never sign any contracts with things blacked out/changed/altered/etc.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Also in the future, contracts should never have anything blacked out or erased.  You should have created and printed a fresh contract with this change on it.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Contact his broker.<br>  <br>  You and he probably should have modified the contract he presented to you, putting 2% in place of the 6%, and with both of you initialing the change. Now you've got a sticky situation of two agreements, both apparently valid, one at 2%, another at 6%. And if you're altering a contract, do it in indelible ink and initial it. Don't cross it out in pencil or anything else that can be erased.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of other problems here, too. If you're in a jurisdiction where the "typical" commission is 6%, that likely means your agent agreed to split the commission with the buyer's agent. So the buyer's agent (and that agent's broker) was promised a 3% commission, with your agent and your agent's broker receiving the remainder.<br>  <br>  Now there isn't even enough commission to cover the other agent. Let's say the property sold for $100,000. The other agent is expecting a $3,000 commission. But your personal commission contract calls for paying your agent only 2% (or $2,000) total. You're asking/expecting your agent to come out-of-pocket for $1,000 to pay the other agent and receive absolutely no commission on his side of the transaction.<br>  <br>  I'm not addressing whether that's fair or not, but I can tell you that the agent wouldn't have agreed to that had he been aware of the contract provisions. Further, I can guarantee that the agent's broker wouldn't have approved the listing agreement.<br>  <br>  Also, I was noticing your phrasing that your agent says he "didn't see the fine print in my contract." Huh? Fine print? The whole purpose of your personal commission contract was to specify a lower commission. That's not something to put in fine print. That's something to put clearly front-and-center. Were you trying to sneak that lower commission past the agent? Further, you "blacked out" the 6%; I return to the question of why you didn't do it better with ink? Or, put another way, you're saying the agent erased the blacked-out area. That ought to be apparent by looking at the contracts. If that area looks pristine, then are you really sure they were "blacked out" to begin with?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be surprised if your agent and his broker challenge your version, based on some of the information I discussed, above. I'd suggest you consider negotiating/renegotiating a comission along the lines of 4%-5% to cover the buyer's agent commission at least.<br>  <br>  However, if you wish to pursue it, you can. Each state has a licensing board, and you can take your grievance to it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|fbb9fc7e22a979652a0e870b1fd145e1aa	Ditto.  Call the broker and the State Board.<br>  <br>  However, what the heck are you doing getting a realtor to sign your own seperate contract.  You shoulda just been emphatic about the broker contract.  Your side contract makes YOU look shady in my book.  Just stick to your guns.  No side contracts needed.

One sure fire method to be removed from a telemarketers list is to request that your name be removed when they call and you are talking to a live person.

COhYuTj3aa	I'm a former credit analyst.  You obviously are doing fine.  Your available debt ratio on revolving accounts looks like about 85% which is awesome.  Your house is damn near paid off.   Looks like you successfully paid off two car loans.  Almost done paying for another one.  Honestly, what are you asking this question for?  The only thing you could do to keep improving your score is open a few more revolving credit card accounts and never use them (tear them up and throw them away).  This would further increase your available debt ration which is a huge score hopper.   Even though you didn't include your credit score in the question, I would gander you are about a 725 or higher.  Nice work.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	It was difficult to read your post with all the caps.<br>  <br>  Pay off the credit cards completely.  Concentrate on the highest interest rate card first, while paying minimums on the rest.

Credit cards tend to have high interest and make it easy to build up debt.

Credit scores don't change that quickly, but credit reports usually monthly.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Multiple inquiries will indeed affect your credit score.  The best thing to do is to get a free credit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies, but stagger them so you get one every four months.  The scoring systems are different, though, so it might look like it's fluctuating more than it is.<br>  <br>  As long as you make regular payments on any debts that you have and you don't close any accounts, your score should continue to increase.  Just give it time.|`|ce8COixxaa	If you are pulling it that often it will. Each time your credit is pulled it lowers your score slightly because it is an indicator that you are trying to get more credit. If you have a service that monitors your score this should not be lowering it, but other methods can.

5222054505f7e9d4aca03f4bfa18d0b2aa	Since the BF is not on the rental agreement you should deal only with the girl and have her break the news to him. Have a talk with her about the complaints you have been getting and your own feelings about having him around. Tell her the BF has to go or you will evict them from the apartment. I'm not sure if you can evict just one person and not the others, but if you can I would do that. Mentioning him by name when giving notice and going for the hearing. That will be easier on the girl and make your intentions more clear. If that's not possible, explain to her you would allow her and daughter to stay, but only if the man leaves. Either way send a 30 day notice of intent to terminate tenancy and to proceed with eviction. After the notice has expired, you can halt proceedings at any time. If he's gone by then simply tell the girl you wont be taking her to court as long as the man stays gone. If he moves out after the hearing date is set you can contact the court and cancel the hearing. <br>  <br>  In any case you should amend the rental agreement to specify who can live there. Just her and her daughter. And limit how long a guest may stay there in a given month, 5 days, 2 weeks, or whatever your comfortable with. But something specific enough to prevent the boyfriend from moving back in later on.|`|AA12340941	I would think if he is not on the lease then you have a right to do that but different states have different rules.  Maybe call a lawyer and ask.  A lot of law offices will answer a question by phone for free like a evaluation.|`|on9xLWegaa	Generally adults living in a unit who are not identified in a lease can be forced not to live there.

Your lease is with her, not him.  Tell her that it is a condition of renewing the lease.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Talk to her about him to get started solving the problem.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Yes you can, since he is not on the lease, he is an extended "guest". <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to tell her that her "guest" now has to be on the lease if she wants to remain living there, rent will go up by having 2 people on the lease. If he moves out, rent will remain the same, however if you hear that he has moved back returned, both of them evicted, due to the "use of quiet enjoyment" that should be in her lease since he has been disturbing others.
iCqfmRC3aa	Ok, I'm going to give you two answers:<br>  <br>  1 - Craigslist - I personally only use craigslist for local transactions. Be very, very leery of anyone willing to pay extra for anything, it is a huge red flag.  There is a big scam going on with Craigslist where people pay with fake cashiers checks, but I know they are offering to pay with Paypal in your case.  I'd still be very careful.<br>  <br>  2 - Paypal.. I use if for my business and LOVE IT.  I use it for everything i'm buying or selling online.  It has good security.  I would recommend you go to Paypal's website and look at the section that deals with seller security and make sure you follow their guidelines.<br>  <br>  Go to your paypal website, login then click at the top where it says "security center" and then go to "how we protect the seller"<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I would still not sell other then local (and for cash) with craigslist.  I love to buy and sell on craigslist, but never out of my area and I NEVER let anybody come to my house, i agree to meet them in a public place to conclude my transaction.  Overly cautious?  maybe so, but I've never lost any money to the scammers, and I've had some try.<br>  <br>  I wonder if it is not the same old certified check scam with a flare ... just suppose they setup a paypal account and let it sit with $10 or so in it, then deposit a bad cashiers check into the bank account that the paypal account is linked to, then order your laptop, paypal draws the money from the bank, then bang two weeks later the check is returned as a fraud, the bank goes to paypal, paypal comes to you ... maybe, don't know .. I would not do it <br>  <br>  Again big flag when someone is willing to pay more then you asked.<br>  <br>  Oops sorry this is so long, but I found another scam with craigslist/ebay and paypal where everything was paid as agreed, but then a claim was made to paypal that the computer was not as adverstised and they demanded a partial refund because it wasn't as shown on craigslist/or advertised.  Paypal opened a claim, the seller wa in the position to almost having to prove the impossible, since he no longer had the computer how do you prove it was advertised properly?  Turned out to be a big problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck and may the sells be always in your favor.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  These are scammers who respond to craiglist postings.

Give him a couple weeks to get all his ducks in a row. If he can't then the contract is void..  Heck, you can write up a contract to your liking..

This will take you 8 - 10 years to complete, then additional years of training in that specialty.|`|AA11966821	If you want a career in Psych or Soc, you will need at least a masters degree, preferably a PhD.

It also does NOT mean you do not still owe the debts.|`|iwS42P9paa	Yes, you probably want to still file bankruptcy. I know you have racked up more debts since the charge offs. And really all a charge off means is that some other company like NCO bought your debt. And then they would contentiously call you and harass you for the money. In this economy the smartest thing anyone can do is file bankruptcy .Sears and Best Buy CAN come and get their stuff if they feel it holds value, it depends. But they have to do this within the time you FILE and before you are discharged which usually takes about 3 months to do. If you have a car and your buying it you can say you want a reaf or a reaffirmation agreement, which means that you are telling the car company and the court that you can still pay for the car. They make you sign papers if you break this agreement the car can either be taken away …or the car note goes up. You should really talk to an attorney though…
xWSIIOpaaa	Every contract you sign comes with clauses in fine print, sometimes detailing obligations and/or penalties for quitting early. If you want to, nobody would hold you from leaving, but you must face the consequences if you do, particularly if you are a skilled professional in a very restricted field of work (e.g. you could get blacklisted for "unprofessional attitude").<br>  <br>  Obviously, if you make it clear to your would-be employer that you wouldn't think twice about bolting out if given a position in the US, nobody would hire you. Ask if they would rather sign you up for a six-month renewable contract instead, and go from there.

You can certainly argue and bring up the points you have made here. They may possibly take it into consideration. The work environment. Is it a legitimate argument? Rarely, but I am aware of a few cases where the claimant (you) did win. It's worth a shot especially in these economic times. I would also contact the department ASAP and find out who is your claims investigator so you can verbally explain to him/her what occurred. They will immediately tell you if you do have a legitimate argument and they will then require you to submit it in writing.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	no you can't,|`|GXilXsghaa	NO.|`|AA11966821	The bottom line is that you were discharged for cause -- again!

Akt4uZsAaa	i dont thing so, but just in case DONT SIGN ANYTHING because so many things will can can go wrong....%|`|AA11173563	make you no. A gift is just that. You do know that your mother in law may be liable for the taxes on the $80,000 as it is way over the gift limit. Now to keep peace in the family I would if you knew it was a loan in the first place since you are paying it back<br>  Pojo is right but mom also committed fraud by signing a gift letter as well|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Sounds like someone committed loan fraud on that house purchase and that is where the "gift" came from.  However, no one can make you sign anything but what's the big deal if you intent to pay it back.  At least do one honorable thing or maybe Mom will go to your lender and explain the fraud you committed.  Like the house?<br>  <br>  Added:  Rusty you will note I was the only one who first caught on to the fact this is loan fraud and don't forget a pissed off MIL might do anything out of revenge and yes even lie.  They have all proven they are not above fraud and lying through their teeth!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Sandy S, The reason people are using the word fraud is because you cannot get a mortgage using borrowed money but you can use money given to you with as a gift with no expectation of pay back. To be sure the money is a gift the MIL signs a document called a Gift Letter attesting to what I cited in the beginning and acknowledging the penalties if there is any fraud in the Gift Letter. The couple also knew this was not a gift but a loan so in fact they both committed fraud to get the mortgage. Pojo, if the mil goes to the lender to turn in her son and daughter-in-law she will be admitting she committed fraud too. btw  No one can force you to sign a Promissory Note. Do you have any idea why she wants you to. If you don't why don't you just ask her? Has there been some kind of disagreement with her about something else and this is some crazy kind of revenge? Don't sign anything from her lawyer without consulting another lawyer for advice. One consultation shouldn't cost too much.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	She can't force you to sign it but she might have a case in court if she had to take it that far.  The "gift" to you was a "low or no interest loan" verses a "high interest bank loan".  If she wants to make a legal record of it and you think it is fair then you should humor her and sign it.  Read carefully what you sign, have your own lawyer look it over if you want.  It was probably her lawyers idea in the first place.<br>  <br>  If it is classified legally as a gift I don't think there are any taxes for gifts between Mother and Son up to a certain amount.|`|093b368d01bbdc03231061bf6fc4d520aa	According to Judge Judy weather or not you sign the note you have acknowledged that the money was a loan by making payments back to her.  She could take you to court and sue for the remainder.   Depending on how her letter is worded you may have a slim chance of maintaining that it was a gift.  However, your payments most likely constitute a "new contract" or agreement.|`|kifwyOgKaa	If you are planning on paying her back anyways, why make a big deal out of it?  Just sign the note.|`|xoUxmiE7aa	I agree you all commited loan fraud and one little clarification to what golfer said and I am sure from previous answers by him/her it was just typed in haste because the answers are always darned accurate.

How would Arby's or even a hospital file this against you unless they were suing you for something, which you would have known. This sounds very fishy to me.  Oh and wash your hands inbetween patients. Never heard of firing somebody for not doing it, write up yes,  fired no.|`|b007371eab69364e811cf06269921755aa	Is this from your credit report? This doesn't make sense. Those entries would only be there if your employers sued you for money owed or something like that.
TLcON6Inaa	Yes it is happening to A LOT of people! Not sure why but the dates have been pushed back a week or two in some cases. If I had to guess I think the IRS is taking longer to process returns due to the stimulus checks from 2008. Many people were still owen a stimulus payment from 2008 so they included it on the tax returns and unfortunately that caused a lot of confusion and mistakes on returns. I would guess this is slowing down the process for the IRS.|`|VKS26NOWaa	I don't know why this is happening, but it happened to me - I should have gotten mine on the 13th, but didn't get it until today - so a week late.  Rest assured, you should have it next week.

His being in another state doesn't matter at all.<br>  <br>  As another answer here states, the process you're following would entitle the lender to invoke the "Due on Sale Clause." The lender might or might not actually do so (thus requiring you to pay the full amount owed immediately), but you should be aware of that possibility.<br>  <br>  There are also tax implications that you need to be aware of. For that, see an accountant. (The questions revolve around the basis value of the property.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	It depends on how your aunt and uncle held title.

Zb9KtIYAaa	A practice today often has it where the business letter addresses the person by first name and then again in the body of the latter they try to bring it back to being much more personal, like a car dealership may start out Dear Bill and then half way through the letter they will say something like your 2004 Toyota is due for an minor service. This implies that they know you on a personal basis and makes you feel like you may know them|`|MIw3GCJyaa	Sounds like a contradiction in terms.

0lCnu1g2aa	I would buy now, you could always refinance. I would also say to you buy a house you can easily afford.  You dont have to buy a house as expensive as you were approved for.  I thank god everyday my house payments are cheaper than most folks pay in rent. I was off work about 5 months of last year for surgery and unemployed, and 2 of it I did not get paid for. Needless to say I was not worried about paying my house payments with the rainy day fund. You should also have a rainy day fund, you never know when things like the furnance or AC will go out, and they are expensive.|`|AA11173563	what makes you think rates will get that low? Buy now FHA or VA that way you can streamline with out an appraisal if that happens|`|ePkiOzPSaa	There's always a chance it will go either way.  The chances of you hitting the market at exactly the right time when it has bottomed out and just turning to rebound is 0%.  That said, it IS a good time to buy based on the low prices and low interest rates.  If you buy a house now, you will probably still see it decrease in value a bit before all this turns around, but it's better than catching it on the other side of the train.<br>  <br>  Right now buyers are cocky and are walking all over the situation.  When the market turns, you can fully expect the sellers to do the same thing.  Some house will sell reasonably, but it's likely that a lot of the sellers will then be trying to walk all over the situation.  They may take their houses off the market while they wait for it to rebound further, and will ask for higher prices.  Just something to think about, you really don't want to wait too long for when everything starts turning around.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Wow. Can I borrow your crystal ball? When will the rates get down to 3.5%?<br>  <br>  Look: Rates are great now. They may go lower. Or maybe not. (My crystal ball suggests they might go down to around 4%.) The difference in your monthly payments won't be that great. I'd worry more about the price of the property itself.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you are and what you're looking for, you may be able to get a better deal by waiting. On the other hand, there are lots of properties that are selling now. I just was contacted by someone who wanted to sell his property (a 4 bed/2.5 bath, built in 1955) in Northern Virginia. I pulled up the comps and roughly 25 out of 35 properties listed in that subdivision in the past 180 days have sold. Most were foreclosures, but the point is that they're selling at great prices--around $280,000 for properties that would have sold for $550,000 just two years ago.<br>  <br>  What's the old saying: Hogs get fed; pigs get slaughtered? Don't be too greedy. If it's a great deal now and you're prepared to buy and hold on to it for a few years, then buy now. If you want the absolute, best deal, and are willing to gamble, then you can try waiting. I'm not one of these Realtors who say everyone ought to be buying now. They shouldn't be. But it really is a pretty good time to buy.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|auegTf2iaa	Keep waiting... All the fools rushed in.. This market still has more bottom.

TLcON6Inaa	What state do you live in? Each state has its own UEB rules about self employment!<br>  <br>  *EDIT -  You can make up to 50% of your weekly benefits without reducing your pay. Anything over 50% will reduce your benefits by the amount in excess of 50%. ie. Your weekly benefit is $100 and you make $60, your weekly benefit will decrease by $10 (50% of $100 is $50. $60-$50 is $10) <br>  <br>    I am not sure why this is but ILL doesn't have any self employment requirements listed as to if it actually counts as employment income. I am in IA and here self employment income is NOT considered income toward unemployment. <br>  <br>  You should call your local office and ask them specifically about self employment income and how to report it each week. Also you will probably need to continue making your weekly work searches.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in your new business venture!|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If you are doing this full time, then you cannot collect unemployment benefits.  <br>  <br>  If you are doing it part time, the rules vary from state to state.<br>  <br>  For example, in New York, you cannot collect any unemployment for any day on which you worked at all, even if you made no money or worked only for 15 minutes.  However, in California, you can make up to $25 per week working part time without affecting your benefits.<br>  <br>  In all cases, you must accurately report whether you worked and how much you made.  If you do not, you be required to repay the benefits that you were paid, can lose eligibility for future benefits, and can be criminally prosecuted for fraud.

They will be able to explain the benefits you're entitled to, as well as the pay scale and number of hours per month you should be paying for union dues.  Sometimes, to pay your union initiation dues (depending on the union), it may take more than one deduction per month, but after that it should be only one per month to cover the dues.  If you are having issues with pay or benefits, your union steward at the job site, or your union rep or business agent at the local union office will be your best source of info.

Mandatory retirement should be 50 and not 65! After 50, most people slow way down physically and mentally. This is a young, ambitious person's world and you'd better keep up or get left behind.

qNVP4Q1Saa	The mortgage programs that are being introduced are to help people from being foreclosed upon.  The plans include for longer terms (40years) and decent rates for low FICO scores that are still credit worthy. So you will absolutely have to refinance to invoke the new programs. there is no free money so to speak. Just longer loans and manageable rates.  The govt is subsidizing the major lenders in this effort and this does not include any private party.  So again, can they help you? Yes!  without refinancing? No! Refinance and get a better rate and longer loan and you may be ok.  Also, call you local community action center and see what programs are available for you with no job, i.e., electrical assistance and fuel assistance etc.  Good luck....|`|AA11206283	Specifically calls for actions to cut rates by banks.<br>  <br>  I don't believe it will; wait a few weeks and call a local bank to confirm.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Sorry, it won't help you one bit, but you will get screwed along with the rest of us by the mega inflation that occurs in the next few years. <br>  <br>  So far, all of the government programs being proposed are contingent on the lender participating willingly in the program, or if the loans are FHA or VA loans which the government has the authority to change.

4VsUKjQGaa	Step 1:  Was the loan a recourse loan or a non-recourse loan?  A non-recourse loan means that the original loan documents said that the house was all the lender got if you defaulted.  A recourse loan means that you were personally responsible for any amount you still owed after the house was auctioned.  If you were responsible and the loan company forgave that debt, then you go to step 2.  If your loan was a non-recourse loan, then they aren't forgiving anything, and you don't have to include anything in income.<br>  <br>  Step 2.  If it was a recourse loan and you are liable for the difference between the loan and the auction price, THEN the mortgage forgiveness rules might apply.  They apply if the loan was used SOLELY to buy, build or remodel the house.  If you refinanced and used the money for a car or a vacation or to pay off other bills, then the act doesn't apply.  You'll have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if the money was used solely to pay for the house, then complete Form 982.  The forgiven debt won't be added to your income for tax purposes.|`|AA11173563	yes you will|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You need to seek out a tax professional - trust me on that!<br>  congress passed tax legislation that would allow you to forgive the taxability of the foreclosure.  But a tax pro is your best bet to ensure you meet the forgiveness criteria.<br>  <br>  If you do not meet the criteria, you will be responsible for paying the difference between what they sell your home for and what you actually owed.<br>  Say you owed $100k and they sold it for $80k, you could be taxed on the $20k difference.<br>  They may not have sold your home yet, but you will eventually get a 1099-C form when they do.<br>  <br>  I'm a little fuzzy on this, but I think you would be in a taxable situation when you get the 1099-C, I think the 1099-A is just a reporting form that you need to hold onto.<br>  Again, I urge you to seek out a tax pro as I've not encountered this situation myself but I know a little about it as my house will be forclosing this year (2009) and I've been trying to read up on what will happen tax-wise.

If you are injured due to another parties negligence you can sue and be compensated (maybe).

RqQDKEVHaa	Good answer from Ed. I have preapproval letters from several private (hard money) lenders. The rates can vary a bit from what Ed said. Often, it's around 5 points and 15%. It's meant for short-term lending only--6 months or so. Then one refinances.    The lenders operate largely on the basis of the equity in the property. Your credit counts slightly, but not a huge amount. So, for example, the lenders I use will now lend 65% of the after-repair value minus repair costs. So, if a property would sell for $500,000 and needs $20,000 in repairs, my hard money lenders will lend me $300,000 just on the basis of the house's value.    There are also other private lenders--people who just have money and want a decent rate of return on it. Their rates will also be higher than bank rates, but often less than hard money lenders. And those individuals tend to be more flexible in their terms and the length of the loan.    Hope that helps.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	A private lender is a person. Not an institution. My neighbor loaned money to young people who needed a loan to buy a car. He was earning 1% interest in the bank. He loaned "privately" at 7%. The car buyers were thrilled to get a loan and he was happy to earn the extra interest.  The same thing happens in real estate. With a private investor , you can make cash offers on houses. Even tho you are borrowing the money, it shows up as cash to the seller. Your offer is not "contingent" upon getting bank financing.   Private lenders charge 18% interest. They advertise in the newspaper classifieds. Or ask any mortgage broker and she will give you a name..
RqQDKEVHaa	I respectfully disagree with the previous answers.    What happens is that the bank has a BPO (broker's price opinion) performed on the property. It's a real estate agent doing comps on the property. BPOs aren't particularly reliable, but that's what banks do. Then the bank MAY factor in what its costs are, but generally prices the house pretty much in line with the BPO. It then lists the house with a real estate agent. Most banks also have a schedule or formula for price reductions. For instance, if a property doesn't sell in 45 days, it'll reduce the price by $5,000. Another 45 days, another $5,000. And so on.    The reason banks really don't consider how much they have invested in the house is because so many homes are upside down. Let's say someone bought a property 2 years ago for $500,000. There might have been a 90% first of $450,000 and a 10% second of $50,000. The homeowner defaulted, and the first mortgage holder foreclosed. So the first lender is "into" the house for $450,000 plus the foreclosure expenses. However, the house is only worth $325,000 today. And the BPO comes in at an accurate $325,000. The bank isn't going to list the home for $450,000--its costs--because it won't sell. It'll list it in the neighborhood of $325,000.    You raise a good point, though: Sometimes banks will underprice homes to sell them quickly...or to start a bidding war. I work with one Realtor who specializes in foreclosures. A few weeks ago, one of her foreclosure listings got 11 offers! The bank had deliberately underpriced the property in order to sell it quickly, and to generate some excitement.    If a bank overprices a property--prices it for more than the true market value--it's likely it's because the BPO came in too high, not because the bank is trying to recoup its investment. That's also why no one should assume that foreclosures are always good values. They're not always.    Hope that helps.|`|0191j9waaa	they will sell it as long as they could cover their cost! this is their bottom line!|`|IqeyFh4Qaa	they sell them at the price that will cover their costs. usually at lower market prices

y4SUDnpaaa	It probably just had something to do with the old card's billing cycles and the statement was sent out before the payment in full was posted. Call the old credit card company to be sure the account now shows paid in full or call the new credit card company and ask what date they paid the old card in full, but I don't think there is anything to worry about.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	You have to call the credit card and confirm this transfer was made.  But to tell you the truth you should wait at least 2 weeks to see if it shows, remember, that we may think that things because they are automated, things happen automatically, but in reality there are so many transactions and hands involved in this that it could take a little while to actually show.  Make sure you close the high interest credit card and pay off the low interest.  You should also call the low interest credit card and leave the balance open so you can pay but not charge.  This is an incentive to pay off your debt and control your spending habit.
AA11206283	the going rate is the going rate. Do you need a full search? Some title companies do current owner searches for a lot less. <br>  <br>  Grab the phone book and make some calls.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Title Search is usually $150 to $300 depending on the area and deed chain complexity.  The only time that you need to worry about the title search is if you are paying cash and are not planning on getting personal title insurance.  You cant just get a title search as it is an accumulated effort.  it is something that must be done and not in a database for viewing.  if you do buy real estate with a loan then the bank will do it for absolute and certain and you pay for it anyway. they will also take out title insurance to protect themselves and charge you for that as well. The title insurance that they buy is for them and once they sell th loan which they usually do then there is none.  if there was a cloud on title and you lose the property, the bank is reimbursed and you are on the street. if you get your own policy then you will be covered regardless.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes. The Dept. of Real Estate does not "approve" any loan modification companies. Greenleaf is not a good company to deal with. The Wall Street Journal warns that almost 100% of the "modification" companies are scammers who will take your money and give you nothing in return. The problem is so bad that many mortgage companies now refuse to deal with anyone but the homeowner themself.

AA11639059	The price to earnings (PE) is the first benchmark. You start by dividing the earnings by the number of shares outstanding and compare that to the price per share as a percentage. If the PE is 75 or some such high number, which is to say that if you multiply the earnings per share by 75 you get a number that matches the price, then there are a lot of hopes on a little income, OR the price has tumbled drastically. This is the start of the over/under value determination, but not the whole thing.<br>  <br>  Another place to look is debt and equity. A company heavy in debt and short on equity is tremendously risky in these days. This indicates a dearth of intrinsic value, so it might indicate an overvalued condition, maybe. Then there are companies that have a book value (equity divided by the number of shares outstanding) that is higher than the market price.<br>  <br>  Finally, for this discussion, you compare the company to its competitors. If you look at Pepsi and then look at Coke, for instance, and see what the difference in earnings per share, equity per share, and other measures of business profitability and potential, then if you determine that for the same dollar of earnings, or the same dollar of equity, etc. one costs more than the other, then you have also made an over/under valuation.|`|ww12lItvaa	By looking at the prospects for the company to make a profit in the future and how much you would be paying now in stock price for your "share" in those future profits.

You do need to report the SSI as ordinary income.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	it is extra income, not just considered extra.  you should ask, but do so in an indirect manner so as not to incite an audit of you ssi. try 'i may be able to get some work, how much extra income can i earn/receive w/o affecting my ssi payment?' or some such. the last thing you want is to create a situ that you cannot remedy, but also, if you're not entitled to it you need to set it straight before you get caught.

A vested benefit of $100/mo.  means that no matter what happens, you are entitled to receive $100/month at normal retirement age.<br>  <br>  Most plans invest their assets with an independent trustee who is charged with paying the benefits once they come due.  <br>  <br>  In my example above, once you reach normal retirement age you should apply for your benefit through the plan administrator.  You will then receive a monthly check from the trustee (usually a financial institution)

To deny this is not only to blame Bush for a problem he didn't cause, but to deprive him of the credit for fixing it with effective policies — which is exactly why the Left is so eager in this case. Here, however, are the facts:<br>  <br>   The unemployment rate bottomed at 3.8 percent in April 2000, and started deteriorating steadily from there (during the Clinton administration).<br>  <br>   The fed funds rate — the overnight interest rate administered by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve — peaked at 6.5 percent in 2000, and had to be lowered in an emergency move on January 3, 2001, "in light of further weakening of sales and production" (during the Clinton administration). <br>  <br>   As the chart below shows, GDP growth fell off a cliff in the third quarter of 2000 (during the Clinton administration).

AA11284831	Unemployment compensation is fully taxable as ordinary income.  And since the withholding is only 10%, and only if you opt to have tax withheld, it's highly likely that it will substantially reduce your refund.

5BTKscZraa	First...don't be scared/tricked by the "urgent notice."  Debt collectors love to create a false sense of urgency...If they’ve waited months/years for your payment, they can wait one or two weeks for any payment or settlement agreement from you. Any “deadline” like 5PM to get any payment to them is bogus. They're trying to scare you into giving them your checking account numbers...don't give out this info. <br>  <br>  When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  <br>  Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt (do not use regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt, including a copy of the original signed application with my signature<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector. It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.<br>  <br>  When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation. Do not let them scare you with bogus threats during this period. This will give you breathing time to explore your options.<br>  ==============================<br>  When a credit card defaults and is charged-off, the damage to your credit is already done and paying them back in full after the charge-off will not magically fix your credit. The charge-off will remain on your credit report for 7 years....paid or unpaid. If you're going to pay off old-charged-off debt anyway, then you might as well negotiate the lowest, rock bottom settlement you can possibly get, being that the negative charge-off notation is going to stay for 7 years on your credit report, regardless of whether the charge-off is paid or unpaid. ...Offer 25%. Mail them a vaguely worded statement like:<br>  <br>  I am willing to settle this matter for 25% of the original amount. Your firm must send me a written agreement on your company's letterhead that you will accept this amount as "payment in full" and that this issue will be settled. Upon receipt of this agreement, I will mail you a money order for this amount.<br>  ===============<br>  * Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. This letter should state the settlement amount and that the account will be settled/paid in full upon receipt of this amount from you.  Never accept settlement deals over the phone without following up with a written agreement...If you don’t, the debt collectors will deny that any settlement was ever made once they get your “settlement” money and will come back demanding more money. <br>  * Debt collectors really LOVE to scare people with bogus legal threats. If they make any legal threats against you, immediately state the following:  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I would like the full name of the attorney who will be taking action against me and his/her license # in the state bar association. I will be calling the state bar association to verify your attorney's information.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	First, all the letter is saying is that, if you do not do what they want, then they will give the bank some advice.  If the most efficient method of collecting is for the bank to continue waiting for you to pay, then let them tell the bank that.<br>  <br>  Second, you are required to pay monthly on credit cards.  Going two months between payments is not allowed.<br>  <br>  If you wait until April to pay, then you will owe more by then, because additional fees, finance charges, etc., will have been added by then.<br>  <br>  If, in March or April, you do pay everything that you owe by then, including what you owe now and whatever is added by then, then that will probably be the end of this.  Even if they have already filed a lawsuit, it will probably not have made it to court by then.|`|8FQnyLxFaa	If this is their first letter from them, there is a problem.

There will be no lump sum check for single or married, only distributed to those on SS.<br>  EDIT:  For the person that rated my answer with a thumbs down, you must not have read the askers question.  The question asks about receiving a stimulus check.  The asker already knows that child support will be deducted from her tax return.

sI3krJULaa	If you start a business and then decide to incorporate, whoever owns shares is a shareholder- be that you, your mom, you brother, or the guy down the street.  I have many clients who incorporated for various reasons, but are the only shareholders.<br>  <br>  So the short answer is, yes.  When you incorporate, you have to show stock on the books, even if it doesn't really "exist".  If no one else invests in your company and buys shares, then those somewhat imaginary shares on the books all belong, essentially, to you, which makes you a shareholder- the only shareholder.  The only way you would not be a shareholder is if you sold all of the stock in your company to other parties and simply stayed as a kind of manager, which most people in a small business environment would be stupid to do.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)

qNVP4Q1Saa	You will never get a loan for more than the house is worth or the appraisal would be irrelevant.  They need to do an appraisal on the home to ensure that the loan amount WILL NOT exceed the homes value.  That said, the appraisal does need to be done before underwriting and it is always charged to the consumer.  It sounds like this is an independant appraiser and if he is willing to forego the $300 and only charge $50 if the loan does not go through, it sounds to me like you have a nice appraiser there. THat is above and beyond in my opinion.|`|AA11173563	very normal as appraiser work independent of the lender and if you back out he or she has already been working on your file|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	An appraisal in your case will be a requirement for the loan so you don't have a choice.<br>  <br>  I used to underwrite Wells Fargo loans...the appraiser takes into account what the home value will be worth once the specified improvements will be made...that is key to the loan approval because not all renovations increase value.<br>  <br>  If you don't pay for the appraisal, they won't even PRE-approve this particular loan program.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Yes, it sounds correct.  You are applying for a refinance, which requires a professional appraisal to determine the value of your property.  Regardless of whether or not you are approved, the certified appraiser needs to be paid.  He provides the appraisal service, and it's not his problem if the value of your property ends up too low.  He has still performed the required service, for which he must be paid<br>  <br>  The appraisal needs to be performed BEFORE underwriting submittal.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	You should be happy that they would reimburse you for the appraisal as that would be a normal fee regardless.<br>  Most lenders will not do that reimbursement.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Carl, I am an appraiser and most of my work is done COD.

Pay one of those appraisers yourself to have the appraisal done in your name, and then share that information with the lender, and tell them what you are doing.  Otherwise you are not legally obligated to see the real appraisal.  Yes it will cost you probably $350, but at least you get something for your money.  This way you are in control of your money and all the rights you have with your purchase of the appraisal.  <br>  They want a real assessment of the property before they approve a loan for you, and then not tell you their findings or lie to you about it.  Pay for it yourself as you would have to anyway if you buy the property, and that way you at least get to see the real appraisal.  <br>  Then back out if the appraisal is bad. It may cost you $350 today but its better than $35000 if you make a mistake in buying.|`|4cf349a007c468f4a0209beca9d3b98caa	Sounds typical.

qNVP4Q1Saa	Sorry there is no legal definition.  The word Hot requires defining, How hot etc.  if your issue is with hot water than it is always more productive to remedy the issue as opposed to arguing. if you are or have just purchased a home than that is when our emotions are through the roof. if it is a new home then I can tell you how to remedy the situation.  A shower in a home needs to be 100 F to be deemed satisfying and that is not even a legal or actionable scenario. tell me what the issue is and I will provide a solution.  In afterthought, if you have purchased the home and the home inspection is over and signed off on then your agent can disconnect as that ship has sailed so to speak. if you have not purchased yet, simply as k that is be fixed.

The best way to establish a legal case would be to find court cases with similar situations and see how the court ruled. <br>  <br>  For purposes of creating a logical argument, here are a few things to consider:<br>  <br>  90-95 degrees is warm enough for a comfortably warm shower<br>  100 degrees is about the right temperature for a normal hot shower, <br>  100-105 is the typical temperature of a hot tub or hot bath.<br>  110 is a VERY hot bath/shower but can be tolerated after you get used to it, but it would hurt at first<br>  120 is considered the maximum temperature that won't scald the skin, and for that reason its typically the recommended maximum temperature to set your hot water heater to. <br>  <br>  Your hot water heater should be able to produce water at 120 degrees and when you account for it loosing some heat through the pipes while it travels to faucet, I wouldn't accept anything less then 100 degrees comming out of the faucet.|`|PxoKseAiaa	There should be a valve or something on the water heater itself that you can adjust.  This way you have water the temperature you like.  Is this a shared water heater?  If so, you may be SOL as far as changing it, but if you have your own, turn the thing UP! LOL  I believe hmm 120 degrees is the norm?  I would have to go downstairs and check mine, but that is what I remember hearing once.|`|RZzMse3Haa	There is no legal definition.  <br>  <br>  Sorry you are having such a problem.  That is just a stupid thing to argue over.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just turning it up as others have suggested may not help, but that is the first thing to try.  If that does not work or only works for a little while then the thermostat needs to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Also, you do have other options if you don't want to argue with them anymore.  E-mail me if you want to go that rout and I'lll explain it to you.|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	The average temp should be 120 and 125 degress F (about 50 degrees C). If its coming out lukewarm, the thermostat should be adjusted on the hot water heater.

MmTe8W8uaa	If you are overweight enough to need this surgery, then you will probably not qualify for new insurance.  Therefore, this may be moot.<br>  <br>  If, hypothetically speaking, you do manage to find new insurance, coverage for pre-existing conditions (those that you already had when you first become covered) is normally excluded for 6-12 months for a group plan from work or 18 months for an individual policy.  However, if you had other "creditable" coverage previously, with a gap of no more than 2 months, then this waiting period is reduced by one month per month of prior "creditable" coverage.  If you have had no prior coverage for more than 63 days, this does not apply.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	There ARE health insurers who will (eventually) pay for the costs of lapband surgery.

0EtjfzRsaa	When you EFile if it is a common error such as if you entered your employers Federal Employer's Identification Number (FEIN or EIN) wrong from your W-2 or if you entered an incorrect Social Security number then you will not receive the Acceptance notice from the IRS that usually comes via Email within 24-48 hours.  Instead you will receive an email that you EFile return has been rejected and it will tell you why.  In that instance all you have to do is correct the mistake and resubmit the EFile.      This however, does not mean that the IRS can not come back on you a few years down the road if something you claimed is incorrect.  While Efiling is considered a more accurate way of filing because it eliminates the common math errors it does not eliminate the fact that the IRS can go back several years on your tax return and find an error on it.     For example if you claim a child as a dependent and your ex-husband claims that same child on his return, just because you receive the EFile acceptance email they will still come back on both of you to resolve the issue of the same child being claimed twice.  The same holds true if you accidentally enter your income as being $15,000 when it should have been entered as $25,000 and you had a typo.      While you may have your W-2 in hand employers are not required to send the information to the IRS until February 28th each year to allow for corrections to W-2 that are not noticed until an employee receives their W-2.  So when you file this early the IRS really has no idea how much you made, how much you paid into Federal Taxes and what not unless your employer happens to file their W-2 information before the February 28th deadline.      The IRS always reserves the right to notify you of a mistake several years after the fact regardless of how you file your taxes, EFile or if you file a paper return.     If you notice you made an error on your return it is highly recommended that you file an amended return, even if it means that your refund is less.  If you wait until the IRS catches the mistake it will cost you MUCH, MUCH more with the penalties and interest.  An error that may have reduced your return by $200 now will end up costing you easily $700-$800 later in 2-3 years when they notify you of the mistake.|`|Watswbclaa	call the irs ask them about your status. 1-800-829-0582, when asked for an extension, enter 462.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	About a month before you are nominated to a Democratic Cabinet position|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Within 24 hours if you went to a professional.

tw44fqCpaa	If they don't take out taxes than you ARE considered self employed to the IRS.  You owe self employment tax on that money (that is the social security and medicare tax that gets taken out of traditional paychecks and is non-refundable).  You will not owe income tax based on the income but you have to pay the self employment tax.  If your income was a regular job with all taxes taken out you are correct that you wouldn't have to bother filing but you have to file this type of income once it's over $400. Self employment tax is comes out to approx 14% if you want a fast estimate of what you will owe without doing the long calculation.  You have to file a 1040, Schedule C profit or loss from business and Schedule SE self employment tax.  Taxact free online can walk you through this or you can see a tax preparer.      Also, if you this company is paying you this way to avoid payroll taxes are you are by definition an employee (they control the hours you work, the type of work you do) then you can file a form SS-8 and the IRS will determine your employment status.  If deemed an employee you would only have to pay 1/2 that self employment tax and the company would have to pay the other 1/2 (when you're an employee 7.65% is taken out of your check for ss/medicare and your employer has to match that amount).

So over the past couple a years, I ended up running up a ton of debt (partying, girls, clothes, ya know) and didn't have a good job to pay this off. On top of that, I had my rent and car payment to worry about. I was working at Foot Locker making like $10 bucks an hour, so I needed to find a way to get some money.    I started to do some research and found out that a ton of government money is given to 'minorities' each year. The money can be pretty much used for whatever you want as long as you fill out all the info they need (your name and address, what you want to use the money for, any school you been to (i only finished high school)). I told them I wanted to start my own clothing line and needed to pay off my debts first and that was it. After a few weeks I got approved for a government scholarship.

gHRbi3c5aa	You fill in a tax return which has to be sent and any tax due must be paid by the 31st of Jan of the following year if you do it on line and by 31st October of the same year if you do it on paper.    A tax year runs from 5th March of one year to 4th March of the following year.    So for 2008 - 2009 - the tax year ends March 2009 and the forms must be sent in and tax due paid by Oct 09 or Jan 10 (see above)    By the way, don't forget National Insurance.    Contact the Inland Revenue -  they'll give you more detail|`|at3fTytsaa	You will be isseud with a self assessment after 6/4/09. This has to be completed by 31/10/09 (paper version) or 31/1/10 (online). The tax needs to be paid by 31/1/10 and will be based on the proportion of your profits to 22/1/10 which relate to the 2008-09 tax year.|`|xxLZGPC0aa	after you make 50 000 thats for VAT aswell, but NIC straight away if you employed anyone - you didn't have to regsiter - i didn't regsiter as self-employed|`|AA12279950	If you get yourself a decent accountant you'll never have to!  Seriously - get an accountant who knows every trick in the book and you'll be quids in ;-)|`|EV7FX89Jaa	haha|`|oFiGyMWraa	Lots of rubbish in the other answers.    You did have to register as self-employed, because you need to pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions. They are charged at 2.30 a week and you pay it monthly by direct debit unless your expected earnings will be below about 5,000 per year.    The VAT threshold has nothing at all to do with self-employment status or income tax / national insurance. But if at any time it appears that your annual turnover will exceed 67,000 you must register for VAT. So if you turner over 6,000 in month 1, your expected annual turnover would be 72,000 and you must register for VAT.    But you want to know about income tax and national insurance. You business has started in tax year 2008/09. For tax purposes your first "basis period" will be 23-1-09 to 5-4-09 (ie from when you started until the end of the tax year). Tax for 2008/09 is due by 31st Jan 2010 at the latest, although if you want to use the paper form its much earlier. Forms and information will be sent out by HRMC after 5th April. The deadline for paying any due tax is 31st Jan 2010.    Tax for 2009/10 will be based on the earnings from your first full trading year: 23rd Jan 2009 to 22nd Jan 2010. That will be due by 31st Jan 2011. Tax for 2010/11 is based on your year to 22nd Jan 2011 etc.    You will have noticed that the period 23-1-09 to 5-4-09 is taxed in both 2008/09 and 2009/10. Unfortunately that's correct. You will not get this back until your final year of trading, when you can deduct this "overlap" profit. However, you will probably not make much in the first few months so it won't make too much difference.    Once you are up and running HMRC will expect you to make tax payments in advance. These payments are based on the tax paid in the previous tax year. EG for tax year 2010/11 you would pay half the estimated tax in January 2011. The second half would be due in July 2011. The final deadline would be January 2012 when you would know the final amount and you pay or be refunded the appropriate amount.|`|Ggq0bjOgaa	By the end of Jan 2010.

oFiGyMWraa	A credit reference file is information about your credit history provided by companies that you have owed money to. This information stays on the file for 6 years. However, the credit file is for information only. It makes just because something is, or is not, on the file makes no difference to whether you do, or don't. owe that money.    Debts cannot be enforced in the courts more than 6 years after you last acknowledged the debt. Making a payment is acknowledgement, and so is trying to negotiate repayments, or even just writing to ask about a debt. If you are unsure you need to make it clear that you do not acknowledge any alleged debt.    If the 6 years are up the debt still exists, but it cannot be enforced.

When I asked them about it, they told me it had to have been me, because they don't just give money to just anyone.  My wife and I were on a cruise in the Caribbean at the time!  It took several months and tons of communication including cruise line verification that we were actually on that cruise at that time before they put the money back into my account.

If you're talking about selling your shares of the mutual fund, that happens immediately and the payment should be in your account in a few days.  Both answers apply to mutual funds in general, not just UBS.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	What kind of "fund"?|`|ww12lItvaa	Depends on the fund. I know many hedge funds will only pay you for withdrawals on a quarterly basis because they have to plan their trades and positions. In that case you have to "sign up" for your withdrawals or so I heard. <br>  <br>  And some funds have done so poorly and faced withdrawals faster than they could raise cash by selling the particular asset that they have delayed or suspended withdrawals for a time.|`|AA12219135	What he is saying is this<br>  He could sell shares quickly but it would create a panic.<br>  If someone owns 30 million shares of something and just slaps them on the market for sale without using his brains, the stock will collapse.<br>  As a fund manager or big trader, they can get rid of a huge amount of shares but, they need to do it so as to not create an avalanche of the stock.<br>  Now, let's say that the fund has stock with 300 different companies. Do you see why he's making that claim?<br>  It may be a bit exagerated but has a fundamental basis<br>  <br>  I'm going by him saying it was an exec at UBS and the term selling the stocks "of a fund".<br>  If it had been his broker, I probably would've assumed he was talking about liquidating his account.|`|oYF3K8R4aa	Can you be more speciic with your question.

0lCnu1g2aa	You have to go to RN school before CRNA school. That being said it can be a rewarding career and is nearly bad economy proof. <br>  <br>  I graduated from RN school almost 13 yrs ago and at the time,  it was about $35,000 for tuition, books, and dorm fees etc.  I went to  a top notch school at a major teaching hospital, however was transferred to a state university when the hospital decided they did not want a nursing school anymore due to the expense. Needless to say I was not happy but was over 2 yrs into a 4 year program. I love being a nurse and helping people. I never really considered being an anesthetist because I dont want that much responsibility on my shoulders. <br>  <br>  You can go into a 4 year program if you can afford it without going to the community college for pre reqs and general ed classes. Some community colleges are actually good programs and produce good nurses.  When looking for an RN school I would ask about pass/fail rates on NCLEX (boards).  I would also find out about prerequisite classes they require such as chemistry, anatomy and physiology, psychology and microbiology.  In a 4 year program these may be included where as in a 2 or 3 yr Associates program they may not.  Talk to your school counselor and check the phone book for schools in your area, chances are they have sent a student to each one of them and gotten feedback.  <br>  <br>  As for my hours I work 3 12 hr shifts a week. I currently work in a Long term acute care facility with vent patients and huge wounds.  I have worked home care for 5 years, taught for a semester, and worked in the hospital in stepdown  ICU and high risk telemetry for about 7 years.  I love being a nurse and helping people.  I currently make a little over $30/hr, but I have been a nurse for 12 years. I started out at $12.34/hr in 1997 and have always made more at a new job than I did the last. Money is not everything and cant buy happiness. Make sure you really want to be a nurse and help people, not just make a big fat salary.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	i am going to be a doctor i heard pre med school is tough but i don't care, wish you good luck, if you become a nurse when i am old man take good care of me, if i become a doctor i will give you good care, if no one does, then i guess i screwed in school.|`|JOx1FQC0aa	About Nurse Anesthetist job can be read in <a href="http://free-yahoo-info.blogspot.com/?q=Nurse%20Anesthetist%20job" rel="nofollow">http://free-yahoo-info.blogspot.com/?q=N...</a>

TLcON6Inaa	You can each take half the "credit". If it was in 2009 the new American Recover and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will apply. You may claim the credit on your 2008 return.<br>  <br>  Taxpayers buying a home who wish to claim it on their 2008 tax return, but who have already submitted their 2008 return to the IRS, may file an amended 2008 return claiming the tax credit. You will need to file an the 1040X as well as the 5405 First Time Home Buyer Credit form and make sure you check box C for a home purchased after 12/31/08 (this is important because homes purchased on or before 12/31/08 do not get a true credit it is considered and interest free loan).<br>  <br>  Here is a very helpful link!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2009/faq.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2...</a>|`|AA11173563	one per  purchase so you each get $4000 next year|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you file separately again for 2009, then you'll each get $4,000.

Its the same amount either way.|`|j5F8MaICaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  My name is Aliza Carpio and I work for TurboTax.  Are you going to claim this on your 2008 or 2009 taxes?  Here's the exact wording on the instructions fro this credit (by the way, you don't need to repay this as long as you keep the home for 3 years).<br>  <br>  You can read on to see how to divide up...<br>  <br>  If two or more unmarried individuals buy a main home, they can allocate the credit among the individual owners using any reasonable method. The total amount<br>  allocated cannot exceed the smaller of $7,500 ($8,000 if you purchased your home in 2009) or 10% of the purchase price..  This means that you can divide the max credit anyway you want....but the total to divide is lesser of $7500/ 8000 or 10% of purchase price. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Here's some more information:  <a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/support/kb/tax-content/tax-tips/6360.html" rel="nofollow">http://turbotax.intuit.com/support/kb/ta...</a><br>  <br>  Thanks,<br>  Aliza carpio, TurboTax Development Manager|`|PkCTYMbnaa	No anyone that is eligible would have to split the amount you each would claim only half. If one of you owned a home in the past three years and only one was eligible for the credit they could get the full amount. The other nothing. Make sure you both qualify with the guidelines.
p83LGQIYaa	the IRS will fix it for you.  They did the same on my return.  I really really hope you get this resolved soon.  I know you have been fighting with them for some time.

AA11966821	Student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.  They must be paid in full.  <br>  <br>  Since you are working, you will probably be put on a payment plan.  By the time you pay all your debts, the bankruptcy court fees, attorney fees, and fees to the Bankruptcy Trustee, your debt load will be far greater than it is now.  They will take your income, distribute it to your creditors.  <br>  <br>  You can budget repayment of your debts yourself and spare yourself from high costs, years of debt repayments and burdens imposed by the court, and a 10-year blemish on your credit report.  Note that while bankruptcy is only kept on your credit report for 10 years after discharge, it is a public record that lasts longer than you, your children, and grandchildren do.  Get going on paying those debts and you will be much better off.
979f2916175ef59c99b2c94ade06b045aa	I agree. It's advertising 101. An ad with a short deadline will get more response in a short period of time than an ad without a deadline. If you have to sell a lot of product in a short period of time, make the deadline very prominent.<br>  <br>  The downside is, after that deadline passes, you have to buy another ad and set a new deadline.<br>  <br>  But in general, ads with a prominent deadline pull better response than ones that do not have a deadline.|`|KpcjvUgwaa	It is one of surest rock solid time tested techniques.

This is determined by the financial aid office when they are considering your financial aid application.  There is no separate application.<br>  <br>  You need to be aware that colleges are very short of financial aid funds and that applications for what aid is available have risen sharply.  Financial aid for college is becoming very hard to come by.|`|AA11284831	Apply through the Financial Aid office at the school that you will be attending.

Otherwise the overall ability of our society to advance and grow is diminished.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	No.  Which is why we all pay school taxes.<br>  <br>  Besides, how would you demand proof from a homeowner that they do not have children, will never have children, were homeschooled themselves and will never hire a public school graduate or collect social security benefits from a worker that came into the system after them....after all your rationale has to be that if the childless person never benefited from the availability of a public school system.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Ain't gonna happen.

In our area you have to be 70 years old to get the exemption and the schools are still under-funded.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Probably not, but ask them just who paid for their schooling.  It wasn't just people who had children.|`|paerqxfMaa	No way.|`|cjcjRvKdaa	There are a lot of good answers here.  Just want to throw in my 2 cents. . .<br>  <br>  If you and others in your situtation were exempt from school taxes, there would be no public schools when your children were old enough to attend.  The point of "public" schools is that the public is paying for it.  If all the parents paid their kids way, everyone would send their kids to a private school. <br>   <br>  People of all walks of life paid your way through public school.  If schools got less money, teachers would be even more underpaid.  Without good quality teachers, we will end up with a bunch of dumb kids running the world.|`|AA10526402	No way!  School taxes are already high enough (at least where I live in NY) and there is no way that only parents would be able to foot the bill without the help with the people like me who don't have kids and all of the people whose kids are grown.  I gladly pay my share because it betters the community if kids get a good education...even if they aren't my kids, they will one day be my doctor, my neighbors, and owners of businesses that I may shop at or work at.  So, I want them well-educated!|`|XEcoJnt4aa	It is the responsibility of the "community" to educate children. It is for the good of all. Uneducated folks would more than likely turn into criminals to survive.I have no children and do not mind paying my share, "for the good of all of us". I do, however , have a problem with me paying for your child to play high school sports. Those that wish to play, should have their parents pay for participating in sports.  I fell better now, thanks . Have a great day!|`|AA11044780	Thats a stupid idea.  I dont know how much your state costs per student, but in mine, its somewhere between $7500 and $8000 per year.  So a family with 3 kids would be asked to pay something like $23,000 a year in addition to the rest of their property taxes.<br>  The other reason it is stupid is this- who paid for your education?  Those same property owners you are nww trying to cheat.  Who benefits from having those kids educated?  We all do as those kids become productive, tax paying citizens themselves.<br>  If your plan was to go forward, kids would be taken out of schools by the hundreds of thousands by parents that couldnt afford to pay.  We'd end up with a whole generation of kids that were unemployable, and there would be nobody to pay into social security and medicare to take care of you in your old age.  That would be great, wouldnt it?
mUdeM1Dqaa	I assume you mean from the federal government? The bill was passed and the amount is $8000. It applies to 2009 only and the amount of the credit you do not have to pay back.

This year you don't.|`|AA11173563	in the way of what? $8,000 if you buy this year. <br>  there are lots of mortgages out there and yes even states have grant money available for first timers for their down payments

If you sign another buyer agency contract it is binding and so on.  They are all binding. Even if one agent has nothing to do with the sale.  I am trying to think why you would have done that. You need to be released by one before you sign another if you only wish to pay for one.  Your best bet is to let them expire and then sign another one. if you don't sign another one and have selected the target real estate, then in the fine print the BAC will state that you owe them in the even that the actual real estate was viewed while their contract was in effect, both of them most likely.  These are the main types of mistakes that hiring a lawyer will evade.  that was a very bad thing.....  If you buy a house then you owe them both.

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Your security deposit is not legally considered rent.

You did NOT pay 2 months rent up front!  A lot of people get confused by that.  Deposit is NOT rent.  Also you are much more than 2 months out from the end of your lease and will owe much more than that if you leave now.  You will lose your deposit and get sued for all unpaid rent, any lease break fees stated in your lease and possibly rent thru the end of the lease.<br>  <br>  She will get a judgment against you, and eventually a garnishment if you still do not pay.<br>  <br>  You WILL pay eventually, even if it is not voluntarily.<br>  <br>  I know it may not seem fair, but those are the laws.|`|2H4QOwFzaa	You did not pay two months in advance--your security deposit can not be used as rent.<br>  If you move out before the lease is up you still owe for the two months.  If you move out without paying, they will mostly take you to court for non-payment.  This will show as a noncollectable on your credit report.  You will have a hard time renting another place.<br>  <br>  If you are moving out because you can not pay the rent due to being laid off of your job, I would try to make some type of arrangement with them. Have your employer to give you a letter stating that were or will be laid off with the effective date.  <br>  <br>  Some owner are open to help people if they are trying to help themselves and not just sit there and get evicted.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Yes, you signed a lease/Contract.  You will owe for the balance of the year. The last month will be applied to the last month so you will owe for 11 months less the months paid. If the place is in perfect condition then the security deposit will be absorbed as well for 10 months, but the landlord usually gets so upset they make up damage reports to absorb that as well. I would call the landlord and try to work something out. tell them to advertise it and seek a new tenant. Usually if they can they will forego the lease. Also try and get a room mate or find a tenant for the place yourself. good luck...|`|1zWMTtZUaa	Why do people always try and use security deposit as rent? The one has nothing to do with the other! Rent pays for them letting you use the property. A security deposit is just that, a deposit to insure you leave the place as you got it. <br>  <br>  Yes, you can be taken to court if you do not pay what you owe.|`|AA11513482	Yes|`|MiglQlyRaa	About paying rent can be read in <a href="http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=paying%20rent" rel="nofollow">http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>
MUbbzN17aa	I'm not in business but my guess would be that they look at previous days, like past mondays and find a mean to get like a base line and then if they've advertised a sale or something they would look at the percent increase of sales that an aggressive advertising campaign or sale has caused in the past and add that to the mean that they found for that day.  If you're starting from scratch and don't have a history of your business to pull from then you are probably just going to have to do a lot of guess work.

908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	I doubt it.  If the rules are the same in NJ and CA for claiming unemployment, the claim is good good for work you did in the past year, and is based on the most you made in any given quarter.  Also, it doesn't apply if you left your job voluntarily, unless there were special circumstances like they cut your hours, pay, or your workplace was a hostile environment.  It sounds like what they're telling you is that in the past year you needed to work at least 20 weeks and have earned more than $7200 (over the last 12 months) to even be considered.  <br>  <br>  Also, another thing is that you couldn't have filed for unemployment even right after you quit.  You aren't legally qualified to receive unemployment while furthering your education.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Yes it is too late.  It has been one calendar year since you were last employed.  You do not have a valid claim for unemployment.|`|20LnuCejaa	No, you do not have a claim.  First, unemployment is for those who get laid off.  Not for those who quit their jobs.  Second, it is only good for 6 months after you are terminated from the job.  Third, you have to earn more then the minimum amount.  You're out on three strikes.

Daq9gituaa	No. The only expenses that might qualify would be if you commuted daily/weekly. Other than that I would say no. I was in a similar situation and my company agreed to pay the lesser of my rent/mortgage between the two residences. I was reimburse for the rent of one place and it was shown as income.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Possibly.<br>  <br>  If NY remained your "tax home" and you expected to return to NY after the 5 months, you can deduct the rent paid in Washington as a lodging expense (like a hotel bill).  In this situation, you could also deduct travel expenses (mileage if you used your car, or the airline, Amtrak, or bus fare, if you did not go by car) and your choice of either (a) 100% of incidental expenses plus 50% of meals, or (b) a fixed, per diem M&IE rate.<br>  <br>  If you received a per diem allowance from the company, this is considered a reimbursement for the expenses above, and the amount that you can deduct is reduced by the amount of the per diem.<br>  <br>  If Washington became your tax home or you expected to remain in Washington a year, or longer, or permanently, then you are not allowed the deductions above.  <br>  <br>  However, if you worked in Washington as an employee for at least 39 of the first 52 weeks after you relocated, or expected to, but were laid off after fewer than 39 weeks, then you are allowed to deduct unreimbursed moving expenses.<br>  <br>  If you worked in Washington, DC, then you must pay Washington, DC., income tax.  <br>  <br>  If you worked in the State of Washington and paid income tax to that state for work performed while a legal resident of New York State, then you may claim a "resident credit" on your New York State income tax return.  The credit is generally either the tax paid to NY on income also taxed by the other state or the tax paid to the other state on income also taxed by NY.

File now, do not wait for the IRS to send you a letter as they will only notify you after you owe penalities and interest.

sI3krJULaa	Oh dear.  You are the furthest from the right track that you could possibly be on.  My first suggestion- get an accountant.  Preferably a CPA.  At least a professional tax preparer.<br>  <br>  An S-Corp has to file a separate tax return.  It's an 1120S.  Then, when that return is complete, a K-1 is generated for you that shows your share of all the income and expenses.  Those Items go on a schedule E, Page 2 under Part 2.<br>  <br>  If you decide to try it on your own, remember that your 1120S has to balance.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :0)|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Staple the Schedule C to your personal Form 1040.  Enter the profit or loss from the Schedule C on the business income line of the Form 1040.  If it is a loss, put it in parenthesis to indicate that it is negative.  If it is a gain of at least $400, see the instructions for Schedule SE to determine if you are required to attach and complete that Schedule as well.|`|aX8AOwpXaa	Since you're an S-corp, you must file the 1120S and K-1<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98263,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/arti...</a><br>  <br>  and the deadline is March 15th.  You also will probably need to file a similar filing with your state, also by March 15th.<br>  <br>  Then you use Schedule E on your 1040 to incorporate your business profit or loss into your personal taxes.<br>  <br>  If your S-corp has hired you as an independent contractor, then maybe you would file the Schedule C as well.  There probably could be a situation where you would file the Schedule C as well as the Schedule E.  If you do this, though, you would have needed to file a 1099 Misc by now.<br>  <br>  All of your numbers and filings have to add up and make sense, and they will likely be checked by computer.  <br>  <br>  Also, there are probably state corporation tax forms for S-corps too.<br>  <br>  The IRS website is the best source.  You can call the IRS up too.  I have found them to be sympathetic.  They try to help.  Call early before the phone lines are clogged!   <br>  <br>  Since every situation is different, you have to either read the tax rules very carefully or hire an accountant or good tax preparer.|`|SykKZrIPaa	About Small Business Taxes can be read in <a href="http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=Small%20Business%20Taxes" rel="nofollow">http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=S...</a>

The perfect criminal contrives to be so normal so like the mark that a good person will naturally feel too much pain if someone just like themselves manages to defraud them. This pain is avoided by rationalizing away the possibility of any pain whatsoever so confident is the mark in their trust of the criminal. Sure a client may have doubt but the Ponzi works because everything the mark needs to believe and wants to believe, in their heart, is reinforced by the criminal's mimicry of their victim - the mark.

Not the banks. <br>  <br>  YOU borrowed more money than YOU could afford. The bank had to take a loss. As such, the 20K forgiveness is the same as giving you a gift of 20K. Therefore, you owe taxes on it. <br>  <br>  <br>  When I purchased my home, I pre-qualified for more than I knew I could afford.

They have done nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  Your divorce agreement should not have allowed you to keep the house if you could not afford the payments on your own. You should have sold the house as part of the divorce and split any equity or loss equally. You have no one to blame except yourself and your divorce attorney for that mistake. <br>  <br>  The IRS always treats canceled debt as income. Its nothing new and there's no way around it. If the bank canceled $20,000 worth of debt that was in your name, then you have to report it as income to the IRS and pay income tax accordingly. If you can't afford to pay in full by April 15th, then you need to get in touch with the IRS to set up a payment plan or take a personal loan to pay the IRS. <br>  <br>  Sorry I don't have a better answer for you, but his is normal for someone in your situation and there are no ways out.|`|zLoyo24Taa	You accept responsibility for your situation and find a place to live that you CAN afford.|`|AA11966821	The bank is not responsible for your divorce.  Nor is it responsible for a divorce settlement you signed which allowed your husband to walk away from the mortgage.<br>  <br>  Did you complete all the paperwork for the application accurately, or did you get a bit "optimistic" on the income?  Many people, eager to get a mortgage, were not entirely truthful on their application.  Certainly you did not consider how you could repay the mortgage under various scenarios, including those that indeed proved true.<br>  <br>  You submitted the mortgage application, you went shopping for a house, you signed the documents.  You and you alone are responsible for what you have done.  <br>  <br>  And now that you shorted the bank and contributed to the banking crisis, you can pay taxes on the benefits you received.  After all, you already got the $20,000, spent it on a house, and don't have to repay it.  So yes, you pay taxes on the money you got and didn't repay.  The US taxes you on worldwide income from all sources.  The money you got from the bank is income and taxable.|`|f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	A lot of lenders acted irresponsibly, lending to people who couldn't afford it, but it is ultimately the borrowers' responsibility to know what they can afford.  As to the taxable debt forgiveness, it does make sense.  Essentially, you were given $20,000.  It was money you owed that the bank will never get and you will never have to repay.  Look at it this way, if you didn't get the debt forgiveness, you would still owe the $20,000.  At your income level, you're probably in the 15% tax bracket, meaning you'll only have to pay $3,000 in taxes on the money.<br>  <br>  My concern is that if you and your ex-husband took out the mortgage together, you should not have ended up holding the bag by yourself.  I think you should discuss this situation with your divorce attorney or a good tax accountant.

It depends on the State you live in.<br>  If the bank didn't send you a 1098 or some other tax reporting instrument for the tax year of the short sale, I wouldn't worry much about it. If they did send some sort of statement, you could still argue that this is an uncollected debt. You might need an accountant to help you specifically, however.

y4SUDnpaaa	My suggestion and how my husband and I handle our checking accounts is with 3 separate accounts. One is for household expenses. Sit down and figure as closely as you can (and estimate things like utility bills high rather than low) what your monthly obligations total. Then each of you put X amount of money into that account. The other two accounts are for each of you to have money you don't have to account to the other for. We decided how much each was to contribute to the household account based on what each  one made. The one with the higher salary will make a bigger contribution than the one making less. Otherwise one of you could end up with twice as much spending money as the other, You want that to be as even as possible. It may not be much but at least it will belong to each person and the bills should be paid. If you don't know where your money is going, each of you keep a record of every penny you spend for a month and then look for places you can cut down or cut out. Like coffee and a pastry in the morning, eating lunch out every day, cable TV, movies, eating dinner out, only keeping the needs and get rid of the wants.

SrkpdglRaa	These are good answers. The only thing that I would add is if you find yourself in a situation where foreclosure is inevitable.

In the long term, a short sale vs a foreclosure on the credit report is a better outcome.|`|bdd7d896b89fd31804e7891c35b2c4e6aa	You can catch up your payments to get your house of the foreclosure process.  However, there is a "point of no return".  And I can't be more specific than that because the foreclosure process varies by state.<br>  <br>  Taking money out of your 401(k) isn't always the best idea, but in this circumstance it may be your only option.  The mortgage company is going to want enough money to bring you current.  So if you're 3 months behind then 3 times your normal payment.  Plus there may be additional penalties to go with that.  You should be talking with your bank and they can give you a more exact amount.<br>  <br>  As for the withdrawal from the 401(k), there are two types.  You can get a loan which you pay back into the account with interest.  Or there is a hardship withdrawal.  In that situation (which you have to meet certain criteria to qualify for) the withdrawal is permanent.  And sometimes there is a tax penalty to go with that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck to you in your situation.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Foreclosure is a rolling ball. Once it starts it is very unlikely that it will stop.  Your 401K will consider house foreclosure as a hardship, but once it is foreclosed it is too late.  Call the bank in every instance and let them in on what is going on. If they can help they will. They do not want your house.  You can get a 40 year mortgage now with the new bill that passed.   CALL THE BANK AND state your case. that is the best thing to do|`|18c8M1dcaa	If a notice of default has been filed,  you will have a time frame by which  you need to come up with the balance owed. Usually at that time it's not just a few months of payments, but the payments, late fees, penalities, filing fees, etc. After the drop-dead date the house will go to auction at which time it can be purchased by investor or bank can keep it. You will need to vacate by that date or be evicted. This is very general terms and it depends on what state you are in, if there is a trustee sale, etc. <br>  <br>  Some owners are able to obtain the needed funds and on the steps of the courthouse, bring the loan current and buy out of the foreclosure. I wouldn't recommend waiting to this point. <br>  <br>  What you are considering doing will involve tax liability, either way. Talk to your CPA about the penalties of your 401(k). You will have penalties the longer you wait to make a decision, and if the house is foreclosed upon it's not like you will be free and clear, unaffected by it. <br>  <br>  Call your bank and see if you can get a human to talk to, ask about a short sale if you can't bring the house current and want to avoid foreclosure. However, if  you have $200K in your 401(k) and owe $250K on the house, they won't let you short sale the house as you will not qualify as financially destitute or without funds.|`|CYjTLablaa	If I were in your situation, I would contact the lending institution and discuss your situation now. If you have had a good history with your payments prior to now, there is a good chance that they will work with you and try to make a payment plan that works for both of you. At the end of the day, they don't want to foreclose on you. <br>  <br>  Here's what I would do in order:<br>  <br>  Write a detailed letter of hardship. The lending institution will more than likely want this before they help you. Make this letter as detailed as possible of your current situations. Let them know what steps you are taking to help your situation. <br>  <br>  Contact customer service and they will let you know what department your loan is currently with. If it's with the law firm representing them, don't hang up. Just call them and work through it.<br>  <br>  When you discussing your situation with them ask them for options like lowering the interest rates, deferring payments etc. <br>  <br>  I don't think that I would suggest touching your 401K unless its your last resort.

AA12219135	Selling short against the box <br>   Selling short stock that is actually owned by the seller but held in the box, meaning it is held in safekeeping. The seller borrows securities needed to cover as the stock in the box may be inaccessible, or the seller may not wish to disclose ownership.<br>  This would basically imply that you sold your own stock short while still retaining it.<br>  I can't see it as advantagous in any way as you rode the losses down with the stock you owned. Seems to me that now that the company is going under or bankrupt, it was better to have sold the stock because, any brokerage allowing you to sell short does charge a fee for the borrowing of the shares and it would be eating into the profit of the position.<br>  Assuming this is a 10 year trade, I find it sort of incredible that it's real, sorry.

hzndl60haa	Yes your assumption is correct.  I did the tax credit for last year($7500).  I received a return of $12,000 which included my deductions for my kids and business (Realtor!).  My only problem with all this is, here I go and try to "stimulate" the economy and buy last year, yet we have to repay our $7500.  This new bill you don't.  I have a serious problem with this.

4UBxVIYFaa	You need to purchase an owner occupied house from January 2009 until September 30,2009.  Purchasing means the deal is closed.  To be a 'first time home buyer', you must not have owned a primary home within the three years preceding your potential purchase.  Therefore, if you close on July 8, you must not have owned a primary residence after July 7, 2006.<br>  <br>  The credit is somewhat limited, by your income levels, as well as by the purchase price of the house involved.  You don't get all $8000 unless the price of the property is $80,000 or over.  As well, if your income is in the higher range, reductions kick in.|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	You have to be a home buyer for the 2009 tax year. The bill was already passed, so yes, its a sure thing.

AA10343094	in your monthly meeting when you update your team, update them on how you plan to implement recycling. the way i would recommend going, is starting to put recycling bins beside the trash cans- much harder to miss- and label them clearly- like with recycled paper, recycled cardboard, recycled plastic, and recycled aluminum. when people see youre serious about getting your company involved by starting out with just these bins, they'll be glad to jump on board.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	tell them if they dont, theyre in for the sack|`|4ew4ogH8aa	put recycle bins right next to the regular bin.

NkEHCHsOaa	YES! I've seen as low as 4.75. Make sure you get a fixed rate 30 year so you have flexibility in payment (you can always pay more if you want). There are many banks out there, who is good depends on your area. Call around and get some input from people who've used those in your area. Good luck! Really you need to refi right now before rates go up because they are going to with this bailout plan sucking up all available capitol out to loan.|`|AA11173563	yes you should but your payment will increase as you should start paying principal as  in my eyes you are just renting your home with i/o notes
1VHF7Y3Zaa	First don't use all caps and at least try to spell everything correctly. Second look the look and talk the talk. Look for a job that an employer can see you doing. If you are to bright or to dull witted, to good looking or just to plain compared to the average person they hirer you are not likely to get that job. This self evaluation requires personal honesty. It sounds harsh but you are looking for something you need. Times are tough and they are going to higher someone they think will fit the profile of a good worker they have had in the past. If you can look like and act like the quote perfect person for the job you are a head above the rest. If you have a resume polish it and add a cover letter specially written for the job you are trying for. Do research on the company. Don't be scared. Get your resume to the person looking for an employee. Handing your resume to the receptionist and telling her you are perfect for this job helps if you can't get it to them yourself.   Remember to keep thinking "I like you!" everytime you meet somebody. This was advise my mother gave me and it has never failed me. It changes the way everybody feels around you and you can feel it when they meet you or even when you write the cover letter.<br>  Network! Talk to everybody with ears. Let them know you are ready to get to work. Take some time and see people in the field of work you hope to do. Most people love to talk about what they do and will take the time to share with intrested people. Sitting in a busy cafe near businesses you would like to work at and listen to the chatter while you read your paper can give you good insite into who is higher and what positions are open. Become a church/community helper and work very hard at it. If you can't find a job somebody will notice you there and the jobs will likely find you. <br>  God really does rewards those that help themselves.<br>  But he has always seemed to take a special intrest in those that really have a desirer to help others as well.<br>  Whatever you do don't hange with your friends all the time, sit around play games, or stay home. If this was going to help you find a job you likely would already have one.
ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Perhaps it is time to make a change to something a little different. Since you have a CDL you might think about getting a job driving a truck away from the coal mines. You could drive over the road but you would be away from home for a week or two at a time in most cases. The hours can be long but the potential to higher earnings is there, although the industry is down right now. I you want to drive and stay local then you might find something like logging or local delivery driver. Mines receive trucks that have other products such as equipment, pipe, machinery, etc,
nqfvPqI9aa	No. You don't. You only pay if you didn't pay taxes on that money for goods. But you can always call the IRS and ask.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	This is a good way to get arrested, even if you do pay all the taxes.  If any of the money sent to you is later determined to be stolen, counterfeit, forged, etc., then you must repay it, even if you have already sent it to another country and cannot get the supplier in that country to return it to you.  If you receive something that was stolen, and especially if you receive something that was stolen and then send it to another country, you can be sent to prison.
qrtBh020aa	I worked for H & R Block, you don't need their protection garbage.  That's just a way for them to make money.  They have to guarantee their work, but remember it is done according to the information you give them.  <br>  Your return will probably be flagged by the IRS if you owe them.  I wouldn't count on a refund unless it is more than what you owed them.  Everything is computerized now, so easy for them to get ya.<br>  Good Luck though!|`|nqfvPqI9aa	Yes. If you owe the IRS, they may take out what is owed to them and give you the remaining with a letter stating what they did. If you don't owe them, let's hope you get your full refund.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|MmTe8W8uaa	A "return" the filing that you (or H&R Block) sends the government.<br>  <br>  The IRS checks some things, such as whether you are claiming anyone who has already been claimed by someone else.<br>  <br>  If you owe for 2007 or an earlier year, that may be taken from your refund.<br>  <br>  If you have not been contacted, why do you believe that you owe?

nqfvPqI9aa	$1,000 tax credit for each qualifying child. And for a house you can generally write off your real estate taxes & points paid. As for how much you'll get back determines on what your AGI is.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	It's not a set amount.  You get to deduct certain costs from your income before taxes are computed.|`|AA11966821	Start over and read the directions.  You do not "get" however much per kid.  You get a deduction from income for each dependent.  If you qualify, you may also get Earned Income Credit -- a credit toward taxes due.  If you have more credits than tax due, then you can get a refund of what you paid in (or part of what you paid in).  You can deduct the interest paid on your mortgage for your primary residence from your income.<br>  <br>  Read everything, and do not do anything until you understand it.  If you don't "get it," you get into trouble with the IRS, which costs you money (a lot of it!).

Then you should approach your bank, all the high street banks do business packages. They will give you most likely a business package to go through and an appointment to discuss opening the account. The package will contain useful info and help you make decisions, plus it will require you to fill in a business plan. The business plan is mega important for the bank.<br>  Your first two years will be your hardest, possibly operating at a loss for quite some time. Bills will need to be paid quicker than money comes in, and you're going to need all the support you can get from your bank. Your business plan will show a reasonably accurate projection of running costs, and predictions of income. This will help you stay on track, and you'll be able to see at a glance how your business is actually doing as opposed to those predictions. So long as the bank is happy with your plan, and you keep them informed of how things are going, they should be more than willing to assist you financially, either loan wise or overdraft wise. Business plan and bank are mega important to you.<br>  There may also be legal requirements. As self employed you will need to inform the tax office, and you may need insurances, say public liability for example.

AHCelSY1aa	They are referring to "Key" positions.  Meaning executive and upper management positions.  This is 100% legal.  Unfortunately, FMLA does not provide much legal coverage to those in executive roles. Although a position must be made available to them under FMLA not necessarily the "key" position.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	yes that is correct, the company can hire a person to take over a position, but they cannot fire you, you will still have a position at that employer just not the same one.<br>  <br>  edit: If having you gone from work will "hurt" the company in any way they can do this even if you are on FMLA. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped.
1zWMTtZUaa	if the appraisal was done at the price you later paid for the property, then the appraisal company was accurate!  <br>  <br>  It seems like we are only getting part of the story here.  Why would anybody buy a house knowing they are paying $30,000 more than they should? Were these "comparables" also new construction?|`|PxoKseAiaa	Probably not.  You knew what the deal was and for whatever reason, gambled.  Now you are down 30k at least and want to blame someone?  Perhaps the mirror will show you who is at fault here.  The first clue would have been the builder picking the appraiser.. LOL  Red flag #1.  At that point, I would have walked away if they didn't let me have an independent appraiser come out. <br>  <br>  Chalk it up to experience.|`|23SkYEw5aa	A couple of things.  <br>  <br>  The BUILDER DID NOT PICK THE APPRAISER!!!!  <br>  <br>  Appraiser are picked by the bank, and even then, they are picked on a rotating basis.  This means that even the lender can't hand pick an appraiser.<br>  <br>  Appraising is not a science.  You should have received a copy of the appraisal.  I'm sure that the appraiser used comps to make the sale happen.  Could they have used comps to make the sale fall apart?  Sure.  However, unless the sales price was so far off base, there usually are enough comps to find the sales price value.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't believe you have a case.  You would have to proof that the appraisal was wrong, which I'm 99.9% sure you wouldn't be able to do.  Second, you wouldn't be able to sue the builder since they didn't "fix" the appraisal. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is, if you knew it was "wrong", you had the choice of not going through with the transaction.<br>  <br>  **********EDIT************<br>  <br>  Based on your revised comments, you didn't get screwed.  An appraiser don't have to use short sales and FC's unless that is everything.  And it appears that there were other comps available.<br>  <br>  For the record.  Just because the lender is "owned" by the builder, doen't mean that the 2 are in bed together.  They are 2 separate companies.  And the appriaser is a 3rd party.<br>  <br>  Reading what you wrote, I really don't think that you made a bad deal.  You have a 4% rate, which is GREAT.  Closing was paid and you got in at 3% of your own money.<br>  <br>  Has the market declined?  Maybe, but a house is a HOME and should be purchased for the long term.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	None whatsoever is the answer to your question. If there was a large discrepancy, the loan would not have gone through. New construction is usually between 5 and 10% higher than market value for the very reasons you selected new construction over the others.  The bank can go after the appraiser if the loan defaults in a good market but not these days as the prices are dropping off the chart.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Your recourse would be to file a complaint with the state you reside in and the appraiser works in.  However understand this, if you took out a loan when you purchased this property, the builder did not select the appraiser, the lender did. No lender will loan money if the appraisal comes in short.  The difference has to be negotiated between the parties. It's not automatic that the builder lowers the price. It's a real estate transaction, everything is negotiable.  I think you misunderstand how transactions work. An appraisal is an "opinion of value" based on current market data.  So even if a second appraisal were done, it could conceivably come out different than the first. But it should be close.

My wife and I have 3 kids so it was important to have 2 living areas instead of one, this meant 2 levels, 4 bed 2.5 baths. You might also consider how easy it would be to resale the house unless you are planning on living there forever. Good luck and don't buy more than you can afford.

When you call the IRS, ask to have a transcript of the tax year that the liability was on sent to you.  If you sent a check or money order for the full amount due twice (including penalty and interest), you can have the IRS trace your payments.  You would need to have a copy of the front and back of your canceled check or traced money order.
7xk2N7xJaa	Fannie Mae is not a corporation or private company, it is what's called a GSE (government sponsored enterprise). Its executives and board and probably a lot of the managers are appointed by the feds. Any losses they incur will be bailed out by your taxes, even before the various bailouts and porkulus bills over the last half-year or so.<br>  <br>  Never forget that it was in fact government that caused this mess to begin with - the Carter-signed and Clinton-expanded Community Redevelopment Act encouraged Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the various banks to make mortgage loans to the disadvantaged - i.e. people who would not actually pay the loans back. This in turn increased the demand for homes which fueled the rise in prices. As long as prices kept going up even people without jobs could keep borrowing against their rising equity and make their payments.<br>  <br>  When the bubble burst, as it inevitably would, prices crashed and all those people discovered that - shock and horror, what a surprise - they couldn't actually afford to own a home. Sadly, millions of honest and responsible people got dragged down with this as well.<br>  <br>  You might (though I promise nothing) have better luck dealing on a foreclosure held by a bank - corporations are accountable to their shareholders for losses and may be willing to take a lower price to get a bad mortgage off the books. Instead right now you're basically trying to buy a house from the feds. Don't expect them to understand concepts like supply and demand.<br>  <br>  TL,DR: Try to find foreclosures not held by a GSE and you might have better luck dealing.|`|0DOZKXwRaa	They are a business, and as such want and need to make a profit.

DorePwVOaa	Probably not, unless you get some financial aid to cover housing. Here's the math:<br>  <br>  $9.25 an hour, but you'll only get to take home about 75% of that because of taxes, so it's really $6.94 an hour.<br>  <br>  Most college students can reasonably work up to 20 hours per week, and not have it interfere with their studies. $6.94x20 hours =  $138.75 per week.<br>  <br>  $138.75 x 4 and a half weeks per month gives you just $624.38 per month, and that's only in months have a full 4 1/2 weeks in them (so not February).

TAS1vdr9aa	RN !! My sister is a medical assistant and gets paid only about $9.00 per hour ! what she spent on the schooling hasn't even been covered yet, and she has been working for about 5 years! You can get your associates degree to be an RN in a little more time and it is so worth it! Also, about the scheduling problem, there are so many things you can do other than working in a hospital/clinic with bad hours. Consider home health care ! They have normal hours, you can work part-time, and it is very rewarding! It's not all about the money but you can make more money at a job that requires nothing!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Help?  YOU have to make the decision:  (1)  hard school/training and schedule with excellent money (RN) or (2) easy school and schedule with low pay (M.A.).|`|0lCnu1g2aa	You might consider doing both. You could go to MA school to get a better paying job, get financially stable and then go to RN school. It sounds like you are driven to improve your situation. You could find a job as an MA that would allow you to go to school and help you pay for it!.  Good luck and think long and hard about your decision.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	In recent years the MA profession has been highly advertised and promoted by for-profit schools that crank out new grads like an assembly line. In many markets around the country, they are saturated with MAs and you won't be able to find a job. MAs are so limited that they rarely can find a job outside of a clinic.<br>  <br>  RNs on the other hand, have superior job outlooks. Some areas of the country are experiencing layoffs of RNs right now but that will be temporary, and in most places RNs are in short supply. You can work in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, doing home health, correctional facilities, schools, etc. The opportunities are endless. Yes, sometimes the schedule sucks, but mainly that's hospitals, and honestly, it's not that bad. Just don't apply for a job that requires nights if you don't want to work nights, for example. And most RNs can afford not to work full-time because pay is good and benefits are given if you work as little as half-time at most places. If you work 12 hour shifts you might only work 2-3 days per week. <br>  <br>  Many people choose to be an RN because they have families. I have spent far more time with my family now as a nurse than I ever was able to before. I am working less and making more money and life is pretty good.<br>  <br>  Another option for you would be to become an LPN first, it's only about a 12-18 month program and you could get a job a little more easily than if you were an MA. The LPN program will make for an easier transition to RN later on if you decide to go on. LPN to RN bridge programs are about 12-18 months in length. If you were an MA and wanted to later become an RN, essentially none of your previous education would transfer appropriately and you'd be starting from scratch.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FVgCPVUuaa	that is really a personal question that only you can answer because you want to say with your family and have a great schedule so you can spend time with them cause they are only young once and will soon leave the nest...on the other hand there is a shortage of nurses and by the year 2013 all the baby boomers will go into retirement and there will be an urgent need for nurses because nurses are getting older and older and we need younger nurses to take their place. the problem is there arent very many schools that teach nursing and or it is very difficult to get into  nursing school. but 2013 all medical jobs should be booming so its you really up to you....|`|cu8fUJbMaa	Going to school and paying for training to be an MA to me is pointless. You really aren't going to get a "leg up" financially and you're going to tie yourself up with loans in order to get your MA certificate. I would be more inclined to recommend that you do an LPN program, which isn't much longer than an MA program and will be much more beneficial to you financially. It will also offer you a very wide range of employment opps, which an MA will not. With an MA you're fairly limited to working in a doctor's office and making between 8-10.00 dollars an hour. An LPN will give you a starting salary in a hospital of 14-15.00 an hour AND if you go to work for a hospital most will pay for you to go ahead and get your RN. That's what I did.  If you decide not to continue your education and just stick with the LPN you will still have a good choice of areas to work in--hospital, doctor's office/clinic, nursing homes, care facilities, etc.
sLlSKHyraa	That is what happen to us last year with H&R Block. Eventually we did finally get our return but both my husband and I decided never to use them again even though we been going to them for the last 6 year or so.<br>  <br>  This year we filed our own taxes and according to the IRS web site our check was mailed off today.|`|XDA2O4nQaa	That why you should not go threw H & R Block because they Suck...i had so many ppl complain say that they have lost checks... If you want a place to go to that is really good..<br>  <br>  Go to LIBERTY TAX SERVICE
0JoWTQWoaa	55 cents per mile is the current rate for 2009.|`|dip4oxB5aa	In 2008 thru June the mileage rate was 50.5 cents per mile.  In July 2008 it changed to 58.5 cents per mile.  Please note that this is not all of your miles.  It is your business miles.  Personal miles and commute miles dont count.  Go to IRS.gov and study any info on commute miles so you are educated.  Im trying to remember but I think publication 563 may help as well as Circular E.  <br>  You should keep a written record each day of all of your miles and where you went, and at the end of each quarter tally up your findings so at the end of the year you are prepared for your taxes.  This is if you are self employed.  <br>  If you are employed then investigate form 2106 and the instructions for it as you can write off unreimbursed business miles that your employer didnt pay you for.

Generally in PA if she is in title, they want her on the loan; but not always. <br>  <br>  You really need to sit down with an accountant.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Listen carefully, if you're name is also on the deed, you can refinance in your name alone. But if your name is not on the deed, don't put a loan in your name.
qNVP4Q1Saa	The first step is a pre approval.  I would first scout out all the best deals on line as they are all available on line these days. DO NOT apply for more than one loan though as each time you apply your FICO credit score take a hit as you search for debt.|`|oojO4WAraa	You don't have to stay with your current lender.  Yes, call local banks - but you could search the web also.  You need to wait until you can get more than 1% drop in interest rates because you will have fees to pay with refinancing, so to refinance for less than a 1% drop isn't worth it usually.|`|uRqlSq6caa	different lenders will charge you different closing costs you'll need to do a cost analysis or break even to determine if you should refinance or not.|`|FoJz5bKHaa	you can get a 30yr in the low 5's.If you are currently paying PMI, depending when you got your home and the location a new appraisal  may or may not be in the 80% loan to value range- could be a gamble that should only cost you between $250-350 like I said all depends on when and where you purchased, the market as we know is a bit upside down right now. First step is to check out the current mortgage co you are with, sometimes they can refi you at discounts, or shop around- it doesn't cost anything to get a good faith estimate and compare. do you have a good relationship with your local bank??? Most banks offer mortgage services and could also cut you some breaks. Be careful of web searches, if a rate is to good to be true it probably is. look at the actual loan rate and then the APR, how far apart are those figures?? the APR is the rate with all the loan fees added in- so if there's a big spread that means you could be paying BIG fees and up to so much as a point.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Dave you just need to talk with several lenders in your area to see what programs that are offering and select the one with the program you feel comfortable with and provides you with what you need and/or want.  Shouldn't really matter which lender you use,  just do your homework on internet lenders very well.  Obviously don't select the one that tells you what you want to hear right off the bat.  I'd make sure they have a website, that is updated,that they have no complaints filed against them in their state or yours, whichever.
AA11173563	you are probably good to go. get with a local mortgage person to get pre qualified<br>  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Where did you get those scores?
