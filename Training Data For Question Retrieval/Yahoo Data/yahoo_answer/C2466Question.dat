20090304122748AAdohBN	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Learning to play an instrument?	I am a college student and I have always wanted to learn to play an certain instrument, but never had the money nor time to do it. Now I have both and cannot decide on which instrument to learn first.      I love three instruments:      Cello   Violin   Guitar      I also like the Harp, but I do not wish to learn it right now.      My question is, which of these instruments should I learn to play first and why?      How should I find the right type of each for myself and how much would each instrument cost?      How much money am I looking at lesson wise and how do I choose a good teacher?      **Note: Difficulty of any instrument is not a concern; I am a hard, dedicated worker.**      Thanks for any help!
20090304122954AApGjB8	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why has the world seemingly taken a sudden great interest in finding life's meaning?	I really have no basis for my opinion. It seems to me that many people are trying to find the truth about life. Other than the fact that so many people ask the same question on 'answers' about the meaning of life, I can't justify my observations.      Why is it that society seems to want to know it? Why are people asking about it? Is it because we live in a time where life has become boring to us? Why would we all of a sudden have such a strong interest in finding the truth?      What is your opinion?

20090304123102AAjvrJk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why is 'Twilight' so popular?	It cannot be because it is good literature because it certainly is not. Every where I go there is Twilight plastered everywhere. I do not even like to go to the mall anymore. The characters do not develop, there is no plot for what I could see, the main character is a Mary-sue (If you do not know what that means, google is a good man), the book is anti-feminism despite Meyer's claims. I can go on and on about why it's bad and why it does not deserve the praise it receives.       I have read all the book so I could make a fair argument and so the die-hard fans could not toss that insult at me.       So my question to you is, why is it so popular when it is not even that good?       Please keep your posts civil. Anything inappropriate will be laughed at and then reported.

20090304123601AA6aDwq	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why are Yahoo! Answers users unable to post questions on ethics under a subcategory of Philosophy?	Every question on ethical matters, in the sense of morals and scruples, does not pertain to the law.  Do you not think that people using Yahoo! Answers in the hope of obtaining feedback on these questions should have more options open to them?  For example, in addition to being able to place their questions under Politics & Government>Law & Ethics, they should be able to choose between the preexisting option and Philosophy>Ethics.  As well, it would make a lot of sense if users could pose questions on ethical concerns under the category of Religion & Spirituality.  Do you agree with me?      As the matter stands now, users wanting to post questions on subject matter pertaining to ethics are encouraged to go under the category and heading of Politics & Government.  Politics and government are two sectors that strike me as not very ethical at all.

20090303175633AATbWHQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What book is this? Its the first in the series and the cover has a woman with blue runes all over her body?	The main character is an orphan who is taken in by the law enforcement (I think the ravens?) when she was a child children showed up with runes on their body and then the day after were found dead, she was the only one not to be killed after the runes appeared. For a wile the killings stopped but then they start up again and she is assigned to stop it. It turns out the children are sacrifices that are trying to awaken an ancient evil goddess and they're using her as a host. She gets help with someone she was a kid with and a dragon. I read the book about a year ago but can't remember the name. Its the first in a series. The cover is a woman with blue runes all over her body in dark clothes (thats only one of the covers a paperback... its been a wile so the descriptions kinda sketchy)

Here's the set-up.   You are in the New York Public Library in the Rare Books section which contains, among other things, a Gutenberg Bible and a handwritten copy of the Constitution written by Thomas Jefferson. All of the books in this section are priceless and largely irreplaceable.     Hanging on the wall is a fire hose. You are in the section when a fire breaks out. If you use the fire hose, you will most likely destroy the books with water damage, but if you do nothing, the books will be burned to ash in minutes. What do you do?

I awoke with the first two lines in my head, goodness knows what I'd been dreaming!      Plague Dogs...................... (whatever they are!)      It was the middle of the dark-time   When the plague dogs came with death   The tribe heard their eery keening   Caught the scent of their foeted breath.   Elders stoked up dying embers   As warriors drummed an insistent beat   Shook the sacred golden gourds   Raised courage with the stamp of feet.      Young ones and the lesser people    Huddled close within the light   Hoping that the beasts so fearsome   Would not claim a meal that night.   A full moon hung high above them   Casting shapes upon the ground   While the hounds in anticipation   Bayed and slavered all around.      He-Who-Sees-By-Night - their leader   Grasped his club above his head   And running from the fire-light's circle   He struck out at the hound that led.   Crushed his skull as though an egg-shell   And like a wolf to the moon he howled   And danced the Dance of Exaltation    Calling his braves to the proving ground      They too left the fire-side's safety   And lashed out in vanquish mode   Conquering the long-feared enemy   - fang and claw and the great unknown   This was the day in primeval history   When man at last stood tall and proud   Instead of huddling by the fire-side   Ready-dressed in death's dark shroud

20090227064727AAfnWxD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	For all young adults,and harry potter lovers,do you like this?	this is the first chapter of my new ya fantasy novel....it's the only chapter written in 3rd person the rest of the book is third person omniscient. (i'm only 16)So give me your opinion.      Chapter1        It was nearly midnight. A tall, broad shouldered man walked down the gravel lane. he climbed the first two stony steps ,and knocked at the door. The house was silent. A moment later, the yellowish light of the living room filtered through the drawn curtains, and the door swung open.           A man in his sleeping pajamas gazed at the unexpected guest. ”Byron??” His eyes widened in surprise. The guest pushed forward without even being invited. His black, leather coat was stained with mud.. The man closed the door, and followed his guest with a mixture of dismay over his long face.           “ Won’t you show me some hospitality Elliot?. It had been a long time since last I saw you, ten years, I guess” Byron said, resting on the sofa." I'm not here to waste my time. There’s an old unsettled business I need to finish with you”           “There is nothing for you to settle with me Byron. I’ve abandoned your filthy business a long time ago, and I won’t meddle in it once again”. Elliot turned to the entrance door, and opened it wide” I think that you need to leave”        Byron pushed himself off the couch, pointing to the wooden staircase standing at the end of the living room.” I guess that victor will be happy to know the nature of his father’s work, won’t he??” Byron smirked at Elliot” I know many ways through which I can find victor and tell him the truth, guess what he’ll be ashamed of his father. I can simply go up right now, wake victor, and tell him every single detail of our filthy business,” He walked towards Elliot, and whispered in his ears” and you won’t be able to stop me”           A moment of silence passed, with Elliot staring right into Byron’s blue eyes, Elliot considered the warning for a second. If victor knows anything about him, for sure, he’ll reconsider their relation as a father and son, besides, any secret of Elliot’s past being slipped into victor’s ears would throw victor into great jeopardy, and Elliot daren’t risk his only son’s life.           “Fine Byron, Follow me”. Byron raised his eyebrows triumphantly as Elliot approached a white curtain hanging down from the ceiling. He pulled the curtain open, and instead of a window there was a wooden door. Elliot turned the bronze knob, and Byron pushed into the room.           Before closing the door, Elliot twisted his head ,and ran his eyes up and down the silent living room making sure that Victor wasn’t strolling somewhere in the house.           “What do you want then?” Elliot said locking the door, and glaring at Byron who sat down crossed legged in an arm chair in front of the hearth” finish it Byron, or else….”        “or what Crow?? Speak.” Byron stole a contemptuous look around the room .it was quiet. Nothing stirred, save for the fire eating at the branches of wood at the fireplace.          After pulling out a chair from an oval table beside the wall, and placing it in front of Byron, Elliot grape a magnifying glass from the same table, and slid it into his pocket making sure that Byron didn’t see it.           “Still playing with your old set Elliot, I can’t help but remember the old memories” Byron said, looking at the oval table that was laden with all kinds of slithery tubes, colorful mixtures, and tomes of advanced math.           “Finish it Byron” Elliot interrupted placing his elbows on the arms of the chair           “Fine Elliot” Byron lit up his pipe and blew out heart shaped fumes. ”Our master Elliot, we must help him. It had been ten years since the last time he walked on this earth, we don’t know if he was dead or alive, but we’ve to find him in both cases. We……”.BOOOM           A short, hunchbacked man leaped off the mouth of a trumpet belonging to a broken c.d player. The man rolled for a few seconds on the floor, before he picked himself up, and bowed in front of Elliot’s chair.        “Sorry, sorry master”        “It’s ok Grimsnail, have you brought what I asked from you”        “of course master “.After flinging to the ground the orange cat  that has been purring  in rhythms in his arm, Grimsnail fidgeted inside his patched vest’s pocket , ” not now Grimsnail, as you can see we’ve guests” . Elliot widened his eyes in warning at Grimsnail who barred his yellowish teeth at Byron .   Neglecting Grimsnail in confusion, Byron’s eyes swerved back to Elliot, and before he continued his talk ,Grimsnail was already sucked back into the trumpet, along with his cat.      “Elliot we must find a way to retrieve Godnofer back” Continued Byron.      “How dare you mention his filthy name in my house”      Ignoring Elliot’s remark, Byron continued gazing at the trumpet, excepting Grimsnail back at any moment.” he has been trapped for  years now, you must help us Elliot, you’re the only one that can re-open the portal”      “I told you Byron I’m out of this game, I’ve a son now,

Her red hair was laying on the chest of an old man while she tried to cover the rest of her naked body with a black blanket she found.   She slowly opened her eyes, looking at the thin cracks in the ceiling, trying to concentrate.She suddenly remembered and hoped that it was all just a dream, she closed her eyes again convincing her self that she will wake up in her old room.   But the telepgone rang again.

20090227070609AAQrYlf	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Help me jumpstart my muse - read and critique?	HAUNTED HALL      Dark brooding edifice perched on a craggy cliff,   chilling my mind with long-lost secrets.   To what terrors did your dark, dank halls,   hung with cobwebs, dusted with ages of neglect, bear witness?   My feeble candle, this tiny arc of fire can barely hold back my   imagined horrors.   Did I hear the tortured screams of some poor condemned soul,   or just the squeak of a disturbed bat?      The icy breath on my neck,   could be just the wind swirling in wintry drafts,   or perhaps,   its' the playful kiss of a ghostly cavalier.      In a musty room, reeking of decaying books and stolen hours   of furtive joy,   I long for a blaze of simple warmth, fire to comfort a lonely mortal   soul.   Oh, for a flame, to let stand sentinel against the night!      I huddle in my chilled skin, seeing in every moon-touched shadow,   some horror waiting to feast on my steaming bones.   Throughout the night I start with fright at every little sound,   until exhausted from fighting for my sanity,   I welcome the dawn,   grateful for celestial fire to chase away the darkness.      Thankfully, I fall into Morpheus's arms, to sleep away the day;   guarded by Sol's golden beams.
20090304110823AA6HhA6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Looking for good books?	I love reading. But I've just finished reading Brisingr (third book of the Eragon series) and I've  already read the Harry Potter books. I'm looking for books along the lines of those; like the same storyline or structure.       I also like mystery stuff, things that get inside the head of the main character and creates a story full of conflict. Something not too complex, and easy to get into like Harry Potter due to its unique storyline.      I have APD (Avoidant Personality Disorder), and if there are books about that then that would be great. I've purchased Anneli Rufus's "Party of One: The Loner's Manifesto" and its great. Books like that would be great too.      Thanks.

Take my hand and enjoy this occation. You'll always brush your hands of these complications.       Surely dreams tonight have kept your fun in making you run. Let me whisper in your ear lying next to you. I'll twinkle your eyes for hopes that are true.       I'm not upside down but im inside out. Time has passed me by reading my boring life. Please dream of me tonight, I swear I'll break the light. Try to hold it, in comes the night.       Waking feet take steps towards the distant horizon. You may fake flight to ammuse my arrangement. Listen to my laugh in no caring for beauty. Just for you I may play this music too loudly.       I'm not upside down but im inside out. Time has passed me by reading my boring life. Please dream of me tonight, I swear I'll break the light. Try to hold it, in comes the night.       Its time for a smoke break, breathe in my fear. This high may let you relax my dear. I know that pillow feels comfortable, but it's time to wake up, if you're able.       Place your sweet hand in mine. This love may turn out benign. Though your mind in mine would be devine, only getting to know you has been just fine.       I'm not upside down but im inside out. Time has passed me by reading my boring life. Please dream of me tonight, I swear I'll break the light. Try to hold it, in comes the night.

20090304121055AA3FCe4	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	The first few lines from the novel i'm writing?	the telephone rang.   a few moments passed, interrupted by an unclear eco through the almost empty room before it rang again.   there, on an old bed in that room, slept a girl. Her red hair was laying on the chest of an old man while she tried to cover the rest of her naked body with a black blanket she found.   She slowly opened her eyes, looking at the thin cracks in the ceiling, trying to concentrate.She suddenly remembered and hoped that it was all just a dream, she closed her eyes again convincing her self that she will wake up in her old room.   But the telepgone rang again.      It was a cloudy morning in an almost empty room in a motel in texas when a young girl slowly got up, putting an arm on a dark blue sheet on the edge of an old bed, trying not to make a noise.   she stood up and...         so should i continue writing it?      *** i don't know where else to post it
20090304121037AA9e2Hv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fast that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090304123325AAfJmQN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In your opinion, does this sound like the plot of a decent story?	Tell me what you make of this plot.....?   A man with long black hair and a beard wakes up without a clue of who he is or about his past life. He finds himself in what remains of some ancient shambles of a prison in the middle of a vast wasteland. He is greeted shortly after waking by an angel who claims that she was sent to protect him against the horrors that would consume him in the wilderness. Additionally, the angel instructs him to gather what little amount of people are able to survive in the wastes and lead them to a safe haven, however the location of this safe haven is vague at best to the protagonist. He then leaves the ruins with great ease as they have long ago been out of order. After wandering for some time searching for life and honing his skills at utilizing his guardian angel's power (manipulating objects without touching them, improved strength… etc) he finds yet another ruin. Deciding to gather his thoughts and rest for at least a little while, he makes his shelter there.   After living there for a few days he catches a brief glance at a nearby traveling heard of large white beasts about 80 feet from the his encampment. And from then on he would make a regular basis out of sneaking among them while they slept and placing food for them to eat that they might evade starvation.. One day, a cub of the pack had decided to make it's way into the man's ruin and sleep with him for the night (the man was initially terrified by this but later realized that this small pup, at least, meant him no harm).Things were livable, not ideal necessarily but certainly livable.   The morning after however, he was lying with his back to the floor when he saw in the sky, some vultures cycling around. Deeply concerned, he woke the cub beside him and started for were he remembered seeing the cub’s pack. But within only a few seconds he had already seen what amounted to a few discarded limbs and an array of blood spatter, partially soaked up by the thirsty terrain. The beast that was left emitted a long a terrible roar at the sadness of it’s great loss. The angel then reappeared to the man and explained that while she offered her most sincere condolences, he must press on to find the menace responsible and if at all possible, any survivors. After hearing this he did come to realize that there was a trail of blood to be followed. And so he mounted up atop the beast that remained and road for were ever the blood trail lead.   The trail dissipated gradually and he had no idea were to look and so he departed for a far off settlement which he could barely see in the distance. He arrived there and was provided with food and lodging but while there heard various remarks from the villagers that there was something wrong with his hands and that he "has a demon" He came to notice that all the people of this place had no black fur, red skin or long claws on their hands like he did. Confused, he consulted the angel and was quickly reassured that the whole business pertained to 'scars of the past' and ought not to be paid any heed. That night he stabled his pet near him at the inn he was sleeping in, and he slept good dreams of leading the people of this region to the oasis that the angel had promised.   The following morning he awoke only to the sight of burning buildings and slaughtered innocents. Cursing the heavens, he was then confronted by his angel but realizes not only that it was laughing at the atrocities that had transpired there but also that the villagers were right, he did indeed have a demon. (it no longer chose to appear as a messenger of light but as a smoldering menace with large horns and an oddly majestic evil about him, oh yeah it's actually a him) He came to realize that the way his hands looked were probably a result of channeling the demon’s sorcery, and that weather he liked it or not, he was a warlock.   The man discovered one of the demon's minions (a possessed corpse of a human) continuing to slaughter townsfolk and demanded that it tell him were his master was. Afraid of loosing access to the realm of men, the possessed corpse hurriedly tells him. Of course, the man had no intention of leaving such a monstrosity alive and quickly destroyed it along with all it’s brethren. Filled with a rage he mounted his beast and rode for the destination told to him and during this time he was continuing to be tormented by his demon. And it tells him that all along, the oasis was really the demon's base of operations and that he would manage to expunge all who live regardless of weather the man had brought any survivors with him or not. And so he reaches his goal and finds a blighted, black area with a horrifying black, burning tower in the center... (I put the rest in add. details)

I have photoshop CS3 and it won't recognize the raw files from the new Mark II.  My friend has CS4 and he says even that version won't recognize the raw files either.  So, my question is how or what do I need to do to be able to edit my raw files from the Mark II on photoshop CS3?  Or is it even possible to use CS3 with the mark II?  I would think there would be a download from Canon or something?  Any help would be great.  Thanks.

20090304115733AAhpqDv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The EASIEST question EVER?	Is this a good near the beginning to a book.       With just a magazine I sat, quickly going through the pages, I only had my thoughts to entertain myself while waiting for the cab.I thought about my mom,my old house, thinking on how I'd never see them both. Not to long later it arrived, with open windows I stuck my head in the cab.      "Can you take me to Wichmond?" I asked, knowing he could.      He assured me he could and I entered the back seat of his cab. I took notice of an info card hung up on the windshield, his name was Hadi, and according to the card he had been driving for over twenty years. But to my surprise he drove awfully slow, like he couldn't go beyond twenty five miles an hour or the cab would break. I looked around and it appeared as though it could easily go up in smoke. But being the impatient guy that I am I said, "Hey can you hurry it up grandpa, I got to get to the house by 6:00." The cab driver angryly muttered, "fast"      He sped up, going so fast all the noises outside the window seemed to blend together, he then turned on the radio to some female Idian singer. I don't know if it was the lunch I ate, the speed, or the music, but I felt sick and immediately vomited inside the cab. "You get out now!" said the cab driver after slamming the brakes, "And pay me what you owe me, plus cost to fix this mess you made."      Feeling ripped off, I gave him thirty dollars; I still had no idea where to go was, so I began to search around the area for the nicest face guy I could find. I learned in the past you don't approach people with a angry expression on their face. But by accident I found a library just across the street from me, it was a two story brown library,I spotted someone outside of it's parking lot.

Such terrible, silent noise,    they’re closing in on me.   Block out their anger.   How can I? I'm clearly surrounded.      Let's hope the dead-bolt    I clipped to the door of my sanity,    and the chair I propped up against the   Doorknob to my mind   Hold up to their ever-pounding fists.      Let's hope that the boards I nailed   to the windows my thoughts once so freely   used to enter and exit through   Keep out their groping, rotten claws   and away from my conscious mind.      Keep your good thoughts in   and keep the others out   and through your boarded windows,    because if they find you,    there’s only one way out.

(No Title yet)   “So…how are you?”   She asks me for the fourth time   In five minutes.   I pick at my nail.   “I’m fine…”   She fiddles with her pencil.   “Oh…that’s good.”   I nod and don’t say anything.   “So…how’s Neuro going?”   She asks me for the second time   In six minutes.   I sigh,   “It’s fine.”   It’s her turn to nod.   The silence between us expands.   It gets larger and harder   and she begins to suffocate under it.   She takes a deep breath   and out puffs a nervous laugh   which skates across   the icy pond of quiet   discomfort that only we could see.   One that I refused to melt   with fake words of friendship.   Much preferring to watch her   slip and stumble   trying to crack it.

Alright..I read this book a year or two back and I DESPERATELY want to read it again..it goes something like this.:      This man has a sickness that confines him to his house, he's adverse to the sunlight, pale, and occupies his time reading. One day a teen age boy shows up at his house saying he's his son from the only romantic involvement he had ever had. Soon murders or the like happen and people start to suspect the man, and his son goes even more estranged. His son ends up being abducted or something. And during a sexual encounter with a women the man befriends it hints that he actually might be something otherworldly. Anyway, the book has a 'is it paranormal?..Is it just occult?' feel to it, and I really want to find it again. Also, the cover art is a two-toned blue, the bottom half of it depicting a town of some sort, and the upper half is in light blue depicting the lower half of a man's jaw.   It was published before fall 2007      Has anyone read it and could tell me the title? T.T

Hypothetically:      If I were to submit a particularly strong excerpt of my current novel-manuscript-in-progress to a literary magazine (like Glimmer Train or another) and it were to be accepted, wouldn't the first pub rights they claim be so they can publish it in that issue?      How would that affect me later on down the road if I decided to start shopping the whole manuscript to agents? Would it matter that a chapter or two had been published in a magazine? Would I need to mention that in the query or elsewhere? On the off chance that the stars were to be aligned and I gained all of these opportunities, how would that work out?

As old as it may be, I love the shine.   The engine's revs, radiator's heat, it’s my feat.       I go slowly, but it’s no matter   It creeks and clatters, it make me feel high   It’s a eye candy that can easily flatter.    The oils leaks and splatters, and yet it’s my best buy.

20090304143309AAVPqZW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you guys recommend a good book?	Hey everyone, i'm a 15 year old teenage boy in need of something to read. I read a lot so I can handle "grown up books with big words and no pictures" (but not boring please)      I like books with romance but not love stories (i tried reading nicholas sparks once. EW), action is always good, if it's serious it should have at least a little bit of humor thrown in here and there, real people with real problems, things with deeper meanings (the primary reason i hated twilight- IT WAS COMPLETELY HOLLOW!!! there was nothing to the story but what meyer was telling you).       some of my favorites-   the perks of being a wallflower, fight club, the things they carried, into the wild, fahrenheit 451, The Outsiders, a million little pieces, the street lawyer, angels and demons, the bourne identity.      something along those lines, something you like, something that someone recommended to you, ANYTHING (except for the shack, nicholas sparks or stephanie meyer).
20090304133420AAroDMD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What Do You Think Of This Opening Extract For My Story?	Basically I started this for my English coursework last year, and I've now decided to carry it on. I was just wondering what you thought of it? Do you like it, hate it, is there anything I should change. This is the opening part of my story (so the first scene shall we say) and most of it is in dream mode. All opinions welcome. The story (at the moment) is called "The Other World" and this chapter is so far called "Escape From Reality". Here is the extract:      x - x - x - x - x       (Dream)      Trees towered over and around her, making the young girl look incredibly small in the vast forest. A variety of sounds pounded in her ears, mingling with each other making her hearing hazy. In one direction birds twittered wildly, while in another, the distinct sound of running water flowed in through her ears.      However, no matter how calm and peaceful the atmosphere looked, there was an underlying sense of tension; a tension that kept her alert. Every time there was a snap of a twig, a rustle of leaves, by wind or creature, or an unusual sound, her fear would increase... no matter how much she willed it down. This did not bode well for her, especially if she couldn’t keep a level head when it was most needed.      Slowly, so as not to disturb anything that’d be unwelcoming, she crept over to a large oak. Relief spread through her, and she welcomed the cool shade with ferociousness, she didn’t know was there. She slid down the rough bark, ignoring the small amount of pain, which was inflicted, as the coarse wood dug into her skin. Not once did she hiss out.       She wasn’t sure how long she’d been there; time, in this world, didn’t seem to matter. And, now that she had had some time to relax and settle her nerves, the girl found herself thinking more clearly. She was grateful for that. Before she knew it, she was lost in her thoughts, and so didn’t notice the shadow of someone – or was it something – lurking in the trees. In fact, she wouldn’t be noticing it for a long time…      (End of Dream)       Sunlight glared through the tiny slit in the curtains, and down onto the sleeping form of Olivia Norris. Feeling the heated stare, even in her unconscious state, Olivia screwed up her eyes, and turned away from the light. Nonetheless, it didn’t satisfy her craving for the darkness that normally came with sleep, and, with a yawn, she gradually opened her eyes and sat up.      Once again she had dreamed that dream. A dream that was showing her a message, or so Amity thought, that she just couldn’t understand. But that was the question: Did she want to understand it? While part of her delighted in the thought of knowing, another side, the more sensible side, wasn’t too keen on the idea. After all, not all messages from dreams were good, and this dream seemed to be one of those.      “Snap out of it, Olly,” the girl muttered, running a hand through her dark blonde hair, catching her fingers in a few knots. “You promised yourself that you wouldn’t fall back into that phase,” Olivia paused, as the sound of a plate smashing resounded off the walls, and screaming ensued. She heaved a sigh, “But it’s easier said than done… especially when your family’s falling apart.”      x - x - x - x       Well what did you think? Please let me know with an honest opinion, and I'll take it from there.      G2B

20090304134728AAYyQZK	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Can someone help me with my monologue?	so ive asked this question and applied what people have told me. my question is, am i taking on too much with this monolouge? what parts are unnecessary/i should cut out? how do i make the first half less straight forward? this is my first monolouge so im not sure how to write them.   this is the edited version:         1917-mother died   Now it is 1927-Ida is 18 years old now       Mother, I just cannot do this. I know you told me to be strong...but…it is hard. I am in this box, and every time I try to break OUT, I see Father standing there, with his hands on his hips, trying to control my life. I see my goal, my DREAM to be a botanist, and it is just out of reach.  (quicker) And I am trying my best to achieve that, like you told me, (slower) but…sometimes I just want to give up.  But then I’m reminded of how much you sacrificed for women’s rights. I would not be even, where I am today without the work you did. How did it feel to be locked in a dirty prison cell among common criminals; put there for just protecting your rights? Well, I guess I can’t ask you, (faintly sarcastic) since you’ve been dead for ten years, almost to the day. (beat)How could you leave me at the young age of eight, when I needed you the most? You haven’t been here---for the tears and the laughs, for the disappointments and the joys. And I feel myself giving into Father; I really need you. But you’re not here. (beat) I mean, really, how horrible would it be for me to become what Father expects?  I could be the proper lady of society that I was taught to be in that etiquette school father sent me to a few summers ago--throwing parties, watching my children, knitting…oh, who am I kidding? I could never do that! You know how I could never sit still for more than a few minutes, and the I’d run off for the creek in the forest behind the garden house, magnifying glass in hand. I remember when you used to call me your little “Alice Eastwood”, which, naturally, Father hated.(nostalgically)     “don’t give her any ideas !” he would say.    *longish pause*      Father thinks he’s found a suitable husband for me. Jonathon Greenland. Yes, one of the richest and most arrogant men in this area. I can see my life: marry Jonathon next fall, have 2-3 children within five years, and spend the rest of my life one step behind Jonathon and staying at home. But that’s not what I want. I want…I want to go to college. I want to learn. I want to experience things. I want...I just want to be free. And not to have my future planned out like the dinner menu at the country club. (pause) Aunt Mary told me I should stop struggling. She said she understood how I felt, but she had given into Grandpa and settled down. But she’s not happy, you know I would rather be free and die tomorrow, than live forever under some man's thumb. These regulations of society don’t fit me and they don’t feel RIGHT. And, you know what? I’m not going to give up.                     thank you so much for all your help!
20090304133808AAtoVEi	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is society the birth of murderers?	So where reading one flew above the cuckoos nest, and in class we brought up how the "black boys" in the book are the way they are and are chosen to care for the mentally ill because they have hate in them due to society. Its kind of like murderes then, in reality arent we all responsible for the murders of other?? Because most serial killers or killers in general arent born tht way, they experience child abuse, or rejection of society. or dont get help form the government because the government wont lend out money because every1 is so greedy and forgets tht humanity is most important, and then it kind of shows how maybe you shouldnt have ever picked on tht boy, cuz he will kill you later on lol.  So what i mean is people are the reason for killers in a way. right??       are there serial killers or killers who are just born bad and want to kill say like michael myers fom halloween even though thts fiction is there any killer who kills without a bad past and was just born tht way.

I guess I am confused as he left the scene of an accident in Chappaquiddick some 30 years ago where a young woman died as a result of his drunk  driving and going off the road flipping the car into a river drowning her.  He was seen drinking and making very merry and he left the scene and did not report the accident until the next day giving himself plenty of time for the alcohol to leave his blood stream. They took a blood sample and it showed much alcohol but he had reportedly had a bloody Marys that morning as he was so shooken up. If that were anyone else we would have been watching the inauguration from a Jail Cell convicted of vehicular homicide.  Money buys everything I guess. So is he worthy of Knighthood Kind sirs??  It makes me sick.

Stumbled, then unsuspecting:   fell into a pit of despair.   My personal abyss, vast as the sky,   as deep as ravines and oceans,   expansive and desolate as deserts.   An aura of hopelessness clung to me.   staining remnants of my joy,   tainting my sub consciousness    with intrusive ideas to make it end.   I hit the bottom of the abyss.   In darkness I wandered.    Utterly blinded.    Stumbled, then unsuspecting:    An outside force, a divine being cast light    into the abyss, warmed my soul,   calmed the raging ocean.   Serenity washed over me, warm water    engulfed me under it's caressing waves   My vision clear, colors and hues appear   An oasis in the lonely desert.    Penetrating the consuming darkness.   Quenched the fire that feasted on fear.   I was free.

20090304143110AAN7oiO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A teen that likes children's picture books?	Is it okay that I like picture books? I just love the beautiful illustrations. They're like galleries of art, some of them. Do you think this is weird? I even sometimes like the unique, artistic stories in the books as well. Obvoiusly I'm not talking about the books that are like "I like my cat. My cat is good. My cat is orange". But some of the more wordy stories are actually interesting or entertaining. Help! I need to know how other people think of this.
20090304140657AAxcnzg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone have good book suggestions, please?	I read The Catcher in the Rye a long time ago, back in 6th grade. I know most people think it's overrated, boring or too whiny but I personally loved it. And I was wondering if there is a similar book that someone might suggest concerning the topic or writing style.    Most search engines and whatnot direct me only to other classics that I've already read such as The Great Gatsby or On The Road. I want a book that deals with coming-of-age but doesn't seem so pretentious as The Perks of Being a Wallflower.    Thanks in advance!
20090304135651AAfsVC6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this story?	Okay, so this is just the beginning, but I would like some feedback because I really think that I could take off and write an entire book with this. Please leave your opinions.         Julianna Starkwood twirled around in the beautiful open fields of her grandpa's acres, that stretched for miles. She had a single daisy resting upon her golden, curly hair, and a white summer dress clinging to her body. She smiled, as the warm, radiant sun beat down on her skin, making her glow. She danced around for quite a while, loving every second of it. Then, not realizing exactly where she was going, Julianna tripped on a haystack and fell, laughing at herself the whole time.      "Coordinated much?" Came a familiar voice from behind her. Julianna turned around and blushed as she realized that it was Jason. He had just graduated high school, and her grandpa was letting him rent the little building that he owned a few miles out for him to live in. Julianna was dead against it at first, because it had always been her special place since she was a little girl, but she had grown to like Jason(as a friend of course).      "Actually," she started, "I'm very coordinated, I just tend to get lost in the beauty of this place sometimes."      "It is very breathtaking," Jason said glancing around them as he nodded his head.

20090304133923AAaK1uN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this? Please be honest?	The sounds were a mix of drums and guns. She moved from the leather couch she was sitting on and looked outside her small window. Outside were two women both similar in age crying and trying to pull away from the two men who were holding them in a grip. The men one shorter than the other looked up in my direction. She pulled away and limped my way back to the sofa hoping they hadn't seen her. The noises increased and her heart beat even faster. In a way she knew what was happening, but didn't want to admit it. Her mind whispered in it's delicate tone. She knew it was right. When her phone rung, she jumped and hit her leg on the table. By the time she got to the phone, it had stopped ringing. She gasped heavily and redialled.      "Hello", said the voice on the other end. "It's me, Doro... have you looked outside?"      "Yes", Mary whispered and took another look.      When she looked down the men were gone, but the noises lingered on      "The war has started", Doro said in a whisper. "You have to get here now".      Mary hung up immediately. Her eyes circled the room. She picked up a frame of her beloved parents and tossed it in her suitcase and gathered a few more things.      Before she zipped her bag, there was a hard knock on her door.      "We know you're in there, open up", The voice was a man's.. heavy and authoritative.       Mary shriveled and resolved to crawling under her bed. silence took over for a few minutes, before the door was kicked in.
20090304143945AAxt5mT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please tell me what you think?	a snippet of a beggining chapter in my novel.. corrections are welcome         As a child, I used to wonder how dying would feel like. In my mind when you died, you inherited special wings. those wings would sweep you across skies, pristine rivers. You lived to breath fresh air and flowers. I would spend my time in eternity laughing, eating the most beautiful food and clicking my fingers to welcome the magic.    When I closed my eyes I was there. Mostly, I would be dressed in white. I would share my experience with my friends and they would join me in going to that place.   It hit me suddenly when I was laying on the hospital bed. I was going to die. Excitement dwelled inside of me at the thought of it. I knew I would feel the sun's glow on my skin, I would taste the rain drops. The room turned silent as each voice moved to a distance. When I closed my eyes, I hurriedly tried to find the mountain top I had always seen, only to be greeted by walls

20090304134344AA0RspU	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Which has the better tone; a 3.5 Rico Royal or a 3 Vandoren Traditional?	I've found Vandorens to be really unreliable; every pack of Vandoren reeds I buy has about half good reeds and half crap reeds. But I've found Rico Royals to be more reliable.      When I tested a 3 Rico Royal, it was comparable to a 2.5 Vandoren traditional... My question is which one is better (tone-wise and reliability-wise): a size 3.5 Rico Royal or a size 3 Vandoren tranditional, and why?      Or is there another size of Rico Royal that has the same tone and stiffness between a 3 Vandoren tranditional and 3.5 Vandoren traditional?      I play clarinet by the way, and I usually use size 3 Vandoren traditionals.

The grass divides as with a comb   A spotted shaft is seen;   And then it closes at your feet   And opens further on.      He likes a boggy acre,   A floor too cool for corn.   Yet when a child, and barefoot,   I more than once, at morn,      Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash   Unbraiding in the sun,--   When, stooping to secure it,   It wrinkled, and was gone.      Several of nature's people   I know, and they know me;   I feel for them a transport   Of cordiality;      But never met this fellow,   Attended or alone,   Without a tighter breathing,   And zero at the bone.      QUESTION: What do the last two lines of the poem mean? Provide your own personal interpretation.      Please post an educated response. 10 points for those who do!
