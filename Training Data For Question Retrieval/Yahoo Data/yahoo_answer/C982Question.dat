20090219150505AAW2V95	Sports;Basketball	In this world of sports where sportsmanship seems to be rare now isn't it nice to know that it still exists?	This is about an unselfish act by a High School Basketball team. I will put some of the story here. The rest of the story is in the link if you want to read the whole thing.  Hope you enjoy->      Amid the grieving, a rare act of sportsmanship      The coach never considered any other option.      It didn't matter that his DeKalb, Ill., High School basketball team had ridden a bus two and a half hours to get to Milwaukee, then waited another hour past game time to play. Didn't matter that the game was close, or that this was a chance to beat a big city team.       Something else was on Dave Rohlman's mind when he asked for a volunteer to shoot two free throws awarded his team on a technical foul in the second quarter. His senior captain raised his hand, ready to go to the line as he had many times before.      Only this time it was different.      "You realize you're going to miss them, don't you?" Rohlman said.      Darius McNeal nodded his head. He understood what had to be done.      It was a Saturday night in February, and the Barbs were playing a non-conference game on the road against Milwaukee Madison. It was the third meeting between the two schools, who were developing a friendly rivalry that spanned two states.      The teams planned to get together after the game and share some pizzas and soda. But the game itself almost never took place.      Hours earlier, the mother of Milwaukee Madison senior captain Johntel Franklin died at a local hospital. Carlitha Franklin had been in remission after a five-year fight with cervical cancer, but she began to hemorrhage that morning while Johntel was taking his college ACT exam.      Her son and several of his teammates were at the hospital late that afternoon when the decision was made to turn off the life-support system. Carlitha Franklin was just 39.      "She was young and they were real close," said Milwaukee coach Aaron Womack Jr., who was at the hospital. "He was very distraught and it happened so suddenly he didn't have time to grieve."      Womack was going to cancel the game, but Franklin told him he wanted the team to play. And play they did, even though the game started late and Milwaukee Madison dressed only eight players.       Early in the second quarter, Womack saw someone out of the corner of his eye. It was Franklin, who came there directly from the hospital to root his teammates on.      The Knights had possession, so Womack called a time out. His players went over and hugged their grieving teammate. Fans came out of the stands to do the same.      "We got back to playing the game and I asked if he wanted to come and sit on the bench," Womack said during a telephone interview.      "No," Franklin replied. "I want to play."      There was just one problem. Since Franklin wasn't on the pre-game roster, putting him in meant drawing a technical foul that would give DeKalb two free throws.      Though it was a tight game, Womack was willing to give up the two points. It was more important to help his senior guard and co-captain deal with his grief by playing.      Over on the other bench, though, Rohlman wasn't so willing to take them. He told the referees to forget the technical and just let Franklin play.      "I could hear them arguing for five to seven minutes, saying, `We're not taking it, we're not taking it," Womack said. "The refs told them, no, that's the rule. You have to take them."      That's when Rohlman asked for volunteers, and McNeal's hand went up.      He went alone to the free throw line, dribbled the ball a couple of times, and looked at the rim.      His first attempt went about two feet, bouncing a couple of times as it rolled toward the end line. The second barely left his hand.      It didn't take long for the Milwaukee players to figure out what was going on.      They stood and turned toward the DeKalb bench and started applauding the gesture of sportsmanship. Soon, so did everybody in the stands.      "I did it for the guy who lost his mom," McNeal told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It was the right thing to do."        http://highschool.rivals.com/content.asp...

20090219163737AAK2gQn	Sports;Hockey	Getting hit by a puck...?	I was reffing a Bantam game yesterday (those kids shoot effing hard). I was skating backwards between blue-lines and the player with the puck was coming at an angle toward me, and I guess he wanted to change, so he shot the puck (a slap-shot). I seen the loft (with the payer being about ten feet from me) and turned and ducked. Well I guess I didn't duck down far enough and caught the puck right in the middle of the side of my head. It hurt so bad like right away, I ripped off my helmet and was holding the side of my head. I could barely skate after that, it hurt so bad. So anyway I couldn't finnish the game the other two refs had to do the rest (like 15 minutes of the third). After the game the other two refs came in to the ref's room, where I hadn't moved from (was just taking off my skates and stuff) and when I got up to open the door I was so dizzy I had to sit down right away. I also had an incredible headache. Later that day I just slept and didn't move cause I felt sick almost.   Now today i just have a horrible headache and still feel a bit sick.   Could i have gotten a concussion from getting hit by a puck?   I was wearing a Nike Bauer 5500 helmet if that helps.

20090220095716AAGCt2m	Sports;Basketball	Utah Jazz = Most Underrated Team = Agreed?	Think, about it 2 years ago they were only 1 game away from a NBA Finals birth for the 1st time in 1997. They lost to the Spurs in the WCF. But, if they went to the Finals chases are they would have won cause the great d Bowen played on LeBron could have been mimicked by AK47 another great defender.      The Cavaliers were not ready that year, like they are this year and last. The Jazz lost D.Fish back to the Lakers after that year and the Spurs did prove they were a tad better. But, last year the Jazz were only 2 games away from reaching the WCF again losing to the Lakers. Jazz that year were the only Western team to give the Lakers a fight last year.      This year the Jazz have been nowhere near healthy. And come to look at it are just a couple of games back for the 4th seed and not to many games back from regaining the division. That is miraculous being that Williams, Brewer, Harpring, and AK47, and Boozer have all been injured this year. This is why the Jazz are underrated and they are a young team getting better and in no time could even be Finals bound.

When you consider we where ￡22 Million in debt when he arrived in 2003, you have to admire the job done by the Man with Celtic Dominating Scottish football at the same time. With guaranteed income to come from The 'Diddy ' Cup final and Scottish cup run the club is in good hands. Hugh Banking institutions are going bust, Established high street stores are disappearing and yet Celtic are bucking the trend. I posed a Question the other day saying the board would have to answer the fans if we failed to win 4 in a row and i stand by that, however there is every chance of a successful season without strengthening giving us more funds in the Summer. With a new Nike deal on the table at a time when even Man Utds sponsor pulled the plug, the club is on a sound financial footing. Retaining 4 in a row and getting direct entry into the Champions league could put us in a financial position that other clubs could take decades to catch up. Well done Peter now do the next thing for the club and bring us in some quality additions in the summer.

Had Joe been able to lead the Ravens to a game winning drive in the last minutes of the AFC championship game instead of throwing a pick six to Troy Polamalu, the Ravens would probably have been in the Super Bowl instead of the Steelers.      Shouldn't they blame Joe Flacco and/or Troy Polamalu for their Super Bowl loss as well?

There is no such thing as a an "Automatic Lock" in the NBA Finals, we're putting too much pressure on the Lakers to win. The expectation level is sooo high, its absurd.

20090220102815AARqmFs	Sports;Basketball	Oklahoma City has a ton of talent and could make playoffs next year?	I mean ya it is a stretch to say they will make the playoffs next year but if they were in the East then they would defenitely.  You look at there team right now and they have been playing a lot better as of late.  There big 3 in Durant, Westbrook, and Green, and you got a great 3 some there.  Durant is turning into one of the elite offense players in the league if he isnt already and Westbrook is a future star in this league and Green will be an excellent compliment to those 2 players.  And then you take a look at what they have done this year in trades and they got Thabo Sefolosha who is a perfect fit for them because they needed a 2 guard who can defend.  It sucks what happened about Chandler but they will probably get a really good player in this years draft and Durant is honestly the 2nd best SF in the league, even better then Melo now.  Anyways maybe they dont make the playoffs next year, but they are probably the next Portland in being very young and having a ton of talent and building there team through the draft just like Portland did.

Think about it Andres Nocioni was the only consistent wing player the Bulls had for the last couple of years.Gordon and Hughes were the most inconsistent players you could ever possibly imagine. Deng may be the Bulls best all-around player. But, he could be inconsistent too and Hinrich had his inconsistent moments.      In those playoff years Nocioni was their best player. He led the team in scoring in that upset Miami sweep and even grabbed 6 rebounds.      We all know he can shoot and at a high position and now w/ K.Mart he can be big. He already possesses one thing that Peja does not have and that is the play making ability where he can put the ball on the floor and not settle for set shots.

20090220094046AAaoTU3	Sports;Baseball	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?   I was wondering if anyone out there has a child with a mild to moderate developmental and/or physical disability who plays in Little League baseball in their area. My 8 year old son has multiple learning disabilities and some motor skill issues from being hit by a car a few years ago. You really wouldn't know unless you really interacted with him. I recently put him in our local LL Baseball league. I'm kind of worried because a lot of these kids have be playing for a while and my son is new so he doesn't really know how to play the game. But they are also very good at it with the throwing and catching. Some of them are also very competitive. My son takes a long time to learn sometimes and I worry that some of the kids yelling at him for making mistakes will start to get to him. He told me he likes to play when I asked him and his coach told him he did a good job at the end of practice. When I enrolled him I wanted him to have fun, but I didn't take into consideration the competitiveness of his teammates.

If Favre would have calmed down and had a good game against the Dolphins in week 14, the Jets would have won and probably would have been in the playoffs. The Ravens wouldn't have even been in the playoffs, and the whole playoff picture would have been altered with a chance that the Cardinals would have played a weaker team than the Steelers in the Super Bowl.      Shouldn't they just blame Brett Favre and his false retirement BS, or even Aaron Rodgers, or the Green Bay Packers organization itself?

20090410150728AAfPIUA	Sports;Baseball	Baseball help please........?	im really getting sick of it. i played jv ball for my school and didn't have a good season my sophomore year. i worked hard b4 varsity tryouts, only to be cut. the tryouts were a joke considering we didn't have any chance to display any real skills. my best friend who was on varsity since the season b4 told me that the coach had already made the list even b4 tryouts. that's always good to know right? well im sick of always being so close and not getting what i want. in september im going to college and i want to tryout for the d3 team. i have the skills to play. i play with everyone who's on varsity during summer and its not like there at a level of play above me at all. i need help. where can i go to train? is there actually baseball trainer i can hire that are not ridiculously priced? where can i find them? im sick of people always saying i was a good baseball player but not good enough. im willing to do what ever it takes to not just play college baseball, but to be a standout player. i want to be good enough to have just one major league scout come by a game just to see me. i just want to prove everyone wrong so bad, id sell my soul to the devil if i really had to. any advice would be great. and i live in Massachusetts if that helps answer any questions.
