20090225071741AATdaHD	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Bachelor's in Enology vs WSET Diploma?	Hi all, I'm a 20 year old student of wine who will soon be making the leap into full-time career mode.  I've been making wine as an amateur since I was 17 and I study daily while working as often as I can, so that I can pass as many WSET exams as I can when I turn 21.        However, I wasn't a good enough student to get into UC Davis or Fresno State to study winemaking in the college environment, and I know that this is probably going to be limiting.  My long-range goal is to become a cellar master or winemaker, does anyone know or have any opinions on whether or not the WSET Diploma exam will be taken as a qualification for that sort of job instead of a formal Bachelor's?

I was here before but unable to get a diffinitive answer, so here goes again.    I am allergic to all sugars and most sugar substitutes except xylitol and stevia but i don't like cooking and baking with stevia. Xylitol acts much more like sugar when baking and cooking.   The recipes i found for clementine marmalade don't use pectin. I'm wondering if it's the peel of the clementine or the sugar that causes the marmalade to thicken. If i am using xylitol (which doesn't cause thickening), do I need pectin and how much for an average batch (16 clementines = 5 - 1 pint jars)? ..... or could i add pectin just to be on the safe side.   I know this is a lot but here goes.   Thanks, jane

If Cheez-It were ever discontinued, I don't think I'd be able to go on.  Goldish is not an adequate substitute, and Cheese Nips disgust me...      Planter's Cheez Balls disappeared without my knowing it till three years later...they did this for HEALTH reasons.  But as the world's population gets larger and larger, we might be seeing certain foods disappear gradually.  This may not happen for another ten years or so, but it might happen eventually.      So what food item would you hate to see disappear?

20090202102848AA6FgP2	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Did you see the guy on CNN who is trying to live on food stamps for a month?Do you have any pointers?	I will 'edit' and add his name the next time it comes on.   It is maddening to see him choose a box of Zattaran's one meal rice serving,  instead of  a bag of rice which would last him through 20 meals!!          Yeah, boring, but it beats the * out of STARVING!!      Then he is getting other things that don't make sense...like a box of cereal which will last only a FEW meals instead of a box of oats which would last mega meals.        What is he really trying to prove ??  WHO will be HELPED by his endeavor?      He even has some woman with him who is supposed to 'know' how to shop to keep him from starving by the time the end of the month gets here.        What is my QUESTION?  Do you have any pointers to make food purchases that will go a long way?        (This guy sure doesn't!!)  and too bad, cause I guess he will be on all month!
