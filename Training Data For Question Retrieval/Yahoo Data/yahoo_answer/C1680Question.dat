That's right, because of the snow we believe the 3 letters of complaint we recieved from Saturday Sport readers is just the tip of the iceberg.      What are we talking about? Jamie saving bacon, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall freezing adult crocs in his bath tub and paying tesco vast sums of money to walk into a building with gas central heating, spending three hours there.      The fact that you are all asking for freedom food that meets RSPCA standards is sublime, that you are demanding bolt guns be used rather than electricution and the knife, heartwarming, that no office closed with heating problems today, suspect. No letters on that issue yet. People have fought, arguably still are, no not for oil. Write what you like about any subject.

All those wonderful hard working Polish nationals over here, doing a hard days work without gripeing, must be laughing at us for being so advanced that everything in and around the jewel of the nation, London, comes to a grinding halt because of a wee bit of snow.      They must be in pain from ribs that hurt from laughing when they chuckle about how the impoverished nation they left to seek gainful employment here, has a transport system and infrastructure that ensures nothing grinds to a halt in even more severe and prolonged conditions.      As a British Citizen I am Absolutely embarrassed and ashamed at incompetent and amateurish mayhem that is our national transportation policy that allows this folly to happen every time a bit of snow falls.      We are supposedly a first world nation yet we throw billions at a problem and get egg on our face. Poland is supposedly a third nation, yet it is capable of using very limited means to implement and execute good transportation in very inclement and often prolonged weather conditions.

For a time-limited period of two and a half years, from 1 July 2009, owner-occupiers without ceiling insulation will be eligible for free product and installation (capped at $1,600) simply by making a phone call.      As an interim arrangement, from today and until 30 June 2009, eligible owner-occupiers who install ceiling insulation in their homes will be able to seek reimbursement (up to $1,600) after the program commences.

20090202114541AAkuMJp	News & Events;Current Events	What is the percentage of immigrants among the palestinian arabs?	Arabs started to come to Palestine in huge numbers t the end of the 19th-beginning   of the 20th century,when British began to build there the railroad and needed the workforce.Its a well-known fact.In 1880,according to the Census of the Ottoman Empire,only 246.000 Musims(mainly Turks) lived in Palestine.When General Allenby, the commander of the British military forces, conquered Palestine in 1917/1918, only about 5000 Arabs resided there. Other Muslims in the area either came from Turkey under the Ottoman Empire, or were the descendants of Jews and Christians who were forcefully converted to Islam by the Muslim conquerors. None of these other Muslims were of Arab origin.  5000 ARABS WAS ALL THE ARAB POPULATION OF PALESTINE.  Only 10 years later,in 1890,all of a sudden there appeared  out of nowhere 432.000 ARABS,and the Turks misteriously disappered from the statistic!The trick is very simple:the ethnicity was substituted by the religious confesion.Every muslim living in Palestine was declared to be Arab So,in just 10 years the "Arab" populaton of Palestine grew from practically zero to 432.000!Even if we forget about the statictical tricks of substitution ethnicity with the religious confession,no country in the world NEVER showed similar rates of the NATURAL population growth .Such rates can be achieved  either  through some Divine intervention of Allah-or through IMMIGRATION.  But this is not the whole story.Only 60 years later,in 1945,the number of Arabs in Palestine,according to British statistics,   ascended to 1.200.000!I think that Allah would have to work day and night to create this new world of a more than one million Arabs for minimum a year,remembering   that it took him a whole day to create only 2 human beings.  So,practically ALL of the palestinians are immigrants who came to Palestine from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan and Iraq.  But maybe someone knows the exact percentage of immigrants among the palestinian arabs who now cry at every corner that they are "the native population of Palestine"?
