20090227080206AAjP4Uv	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How are electrons replaced when, in the event of an earth fault, some have been lost in the ground?	I understand that electrons travel along conductors in a continuous circuit and that they are neither lost nor used up so therefore never need replacing. What baffles me is what happens to electrons under fault conditions. Once some electrons have effectively been diverted into the ground (via the circuit protective conductor, earth rod etc), surely they do need to be replaced.

20090305124659AA6ozjB	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Are there any sportscars with high end torque instead of low end torque?	Low end torque where is you feel it from the start of the RPM's, but High end torque is when you feel more power when the RPM's are at their highest levels.       When you drive a car with low end torque, it makes you feel like you're getting pushed back hard in your car seat like...."Vrroom.....Damn! What starting off power this car has!" from the start when you push on the gas.       When you drive a high end torque car it feels like your car can catch up with anyone's car. It feels like it's covering a lot of ground in a short amount of time and it has a lot of top speed. As if it's taking huge strides on the road like a cheetah or something! Like it's using the road ahead as a vacuum for it's power and the farther it goes down the road the more powerful the vacuum (your car) is sucking in the power! What a thrill as well. Anyway, that's what my sports car feels like because it has a lot of high end torque. I drive a Toyota Celica GT-S. Now, I love sportscars just like everybody else but what other cars do you know of have high end torque? If I ever get another sportscar I want a high end torque sports car, I love the second feel better when I'm in a sportscar.

In August and December of 1998, a researcher collected behavioral data by observing the hippo population (consisting of one adult male, one adult female, and one sub adult female) of the Toledo Zoo. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of enclosure differences on the behavior of the hippos. During the August data collection period, the hippos were observed in a large, naturalistic outdoor enclosure called a hippoquarium. Data were collected during public viewing hours (10:00 AM - 6:00 PM). The hippos were fed daily at 6:30 PM, off exhibit. Thus, feeding behaviors were rare periods of data collection were rarely observed. Animal/keeper interactions were rare when the animals were housed outdoors.  During the December observations, the hippos were housed indoors in a small, barren enclosure consisting of concrete walls and a small pool. Indoor data were collected during public viewing hours (10:00 AM – 5:00 PM) and the hippos were fed daily at 11:00 AM. Consequently, feeding behaviors were observed daily. In addition, interactions with keepers were about 10 times more frequent when the animals were housed indoors than outdoors.       1. What is the independent variable in this study?      2. What is the dependent variable in this study?

I understand that the temperature of the electromagnetic radiation is directly proportional to its frequency. Am I right to say that our body is only sensitive to the EM wave which has the same frequency as our body molecules? As such, can I thus conclude that our body could only detect infrared radiation which has the suitable frequency that coincides with our body molecules? Similarly, when we subject our bodies to x-rays, we do not feel the heat from the radiation but does that mean that x-ray has no heat or simply because our body cannot detect the heat due to different frequency?

Hawking ha detto che nel 2020, piu o meno, ci sara' la teoria su tutto, la theory of everything, cioe' una sola teoria che spieghera' tutti i fenomeni della fisica. se ho capito bene (perche' il discorso dopo un po' mi fa scoppiare il cervello) unira' tutte le forze della natura, per esempio la gravita', le forzi nucleari e tutto cio' che elettromagnetico. A me pare impossibile, ma so che dalla fisica ci si puo' aspettare tutto: voi credete sia possibile?

20060824071150AAH3ef5	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Money puzzle?	Three guys are eating at a restaurant. When they finish, their tab is $15. They decide to split it evenly, so they each give $5 to the waiter. The waiter gives the money to the store owner, who happens to be a good friend of the three guys. The store owner decides to take $5 of the three guys' tab, so he gives the waiter five $1 bills and tells him to split evenly among the three guys.   The waiter is not very good at math, and also not very honest, so instead of figuring out how to split $5 among three people, he just gives each guy a $1 bill and keeps the other two for himself.   Now each guy paid $5 and got $1 back, so each guy effectively paid $4. There are three guys, so between thre three of them, they paid $12. The waiter has $2 more in his pocket. This adds up to $14. If the original tab was $15, then where did the remaining dollar go?
