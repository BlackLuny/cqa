20090226192730AANKkR6	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	What do I need for a faster, better performing PC?	I have an HP m7170n Media Center PC. It came with XP but I upgraded it to Vista when it first came out and I have issues with the graphics card, I believe... sometimes FireFox and AIM will shut down for no reason... not too sure what it is.      I am looking to make it faster and to not have issues like I have been having. I play the occasional game, like the Sims and I edit photography and chat and browse online daily. I am buying a laptop for now but I use my desktop more and would rather have that be the better performer.       I have been browsing Newegg trying to find out what exactly I need but I am a noob and know nothing. Any questions about my computer, just ask!

20090226192918AAJlRM2	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What is the best way to upgrade my laptop?	I have a Dell inspiron 1525 with the integrated graphics card. I know i probably need an external adapter to upgrade the graphics card but wasn't sure if they made one for vista with this model laptop. Any suggestions for upgrading my graphics would be greatly appreciated. I am usually very good with computers so feel free to use terminology usually reserved for those who aren't as advanced in this field. If other specs are needed on this situation please let me know and i will update as needed or e-mail me and i can give better details.
20090226193429AA5ZwRT	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ Help?  Anyone?  I'm in trouble.?	Well, not really.  But I'm really lost.  Okay, so, my issue is...      I've got a file of numbers I've uploaded into an array.  However, I need to figure out how to sum up the values in the array, as well as display the total number of objects in the array.  Anyone who can tell me how to script both of these?  Thanks much...        Oh, btw.  The array file is loaded into and stored in 'x[]'.  If you could include that in the script to give me an idea of where I'm going, it'd be appreciated.

Hi,      I am new to web development, and have run into an issue that I cant seem to work out in flash.

Thanks

20090226203038AAB9WIC	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why won't my PC boot on the first try?	Hi. I'm trying to fix a friend's older PC - one of those no-name custom builds with a AMD Duron processor, running at 946 Mhz. The problem is that about 90% of the time it won't boot the first time, but it will ALWAYS boots if you turn it off and immediately turn it back on (up to 10-12 seconds after turning it off the first time). During the first try you get no beeps, no POST and no video, but the fans are working.      BUT on the second try it ALWAYS boots up normally and works fine until you turn it off and back on again. I've tried just about all I can think of to remedy the problem as I imagine with time it will get worse. Cleaned the contacts for the memory and reseated them (2x128 mb - I know...sad). Cleaned contacts from graphic card, reseated it and replacing it with a known working one. Connected to the onboard video controller rather than the graphic card. Tested the PSU and swapped it with a known working one. Reset the CMOS by removing the battery. Tested the hard drive, reformatted it and reinstalled OS.  I removed all peripherals (cd-rom, floppy, cards, ..etc), running it with bare essentials. All drivers are working properly. Short of a defective motherboard or CPU, can this be caused by something else?       What's odd is that it always starts up when practically restarted immediately after first attempt and it will run fine if used all day.      More specs:   Motherboard: Matsonic MS8308E   OS: Window XP Pro SP2   80 gb Hitachi Deskstar HDD :4-dontkno

20090225123316AA0ieM3	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I'm having frequent unresponsivness from my laptop and I cant find a cause, help?	Recently I've been experiance slowly worsening rates of complete unresponsiveness from my laptop. It can occur in short bursts (stopping everything for a second or 2) and can stretch for as long as 10 minutes when I finally give up hope and force it to shut down. It seems unable to keep up simply, text is being input but not displayed so I cant format my messages until I see them, and missed buttons and longer crashes can cause programs to become unresponsive and fail entirely. Often I cant enter certain folders as they make Explorer crash. It can take 15 minutes to open a audio file.      I know the following:      It isnt I virus, spyware, worm, trojan or any form of malicious process. I have repeatedly scanned the laptop with various anti-[malicious item] software packages, and have scanned the registry for entries that shouldnt be there. Unless its Zlob (which I doubt) or any other form of undetectable internet pathogen, Im clean.      RAM is kept freed up (always at least 1Gb) and the crashing is mostly prolific in low processor / RAM / graphical demanding programs (broswers, IM, word processing, mediaplayers), so everything seems good on the "over use" front.      The laptop has 15Gb of free HDD space, is defragmented often and disc cleaned periodically, along with any other general maintainence that must be done.      My Specs are thus:      AMD Turion 64x2 1.98Ghz   2Gb RAM   GeForce 7150M   100Gb HDD (Unsure of specifics)   Its 3 years old I think, now.      Its heavily used, is this just it getting old? Its actually glitching in the middle of music causing music to be painful to listen to (loud, nothing, loud, nothing equals headache and incoherence).      Thanks for reading, any suggestions would be appreciated.      (Im buying a new PC in a year so no suggestions of just buying new hardware =P)

20090226215408AAlRsOG	Computers & Internet;Software	My XP is running dog slow. It's explorer.?	I've run spyware and virus checkers, the register is okay. I have a nice broadband connection. It's a nice machine, 2007 technology.       But. XP boots up quickly, once I select myself as user, it takes a loooong time to get everything going. Like 10 minutes. If I start up an office document, it takes a long time for it to come up. If I need to use file explorer, it takes a long time to get the folders all found. If I start up IE or Foxfire, it takes a long time for any controls to be available for a mouse click. Once the query goes out, the internet connection is fine. But getting there takes time.      I think I just need to reload windows. I think the guts of IE reach into the guts of Windows, and it is doing some instruction about 2 million times for each thing the OS has to do.       Anyone have any ideas?

I know that I go to my Internet's website which is some numbers with dot's in them.      So I went there and it's telling me to come up with a password, I dont know what it is and I dont think I ever created one, but I'm not sure?      I dont know what my username is either.      If anyone answers this question, I try it and it works, You'll get best answer.      Thanks :)

20090226195023AAYlBca	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can I Read a File in "Circular Buffer" Structure? C++?	1. Assume i have .exe file & opened it by fopen() or whatever. After this, i started searching for certain data by following this method Circular Buffer, example of the data is the int "22321" or whatever. Now "22321" resides in the middle of the file, how can i replace this number by "03770"?      2. When i read .exe file, i will have to search this number "22321" in Hex, right? I guess so, since .exe has machine code...      I have not done this yet, i prefer to ask first to get an idea...      Here is what i thought about:      1. open the .exe file by a function from a standard library.      2. go from loc[0] location until you find the location of hex "22321" lets say loc[140]      3. now move all data before "22321" to a temporary file.      4. add this number in the temporary file "03770" - of course put it in hex      5. go back the original file & start reading after "22321", move all the data after 22321 to the temporary file.      6. my temporary file will have the full data      7. move all the data from temp file to the original .exe      8. .exe is already done & "22321" overwritten successfully      What do you think about this algorithm? I find it not efficient! What if the original file which has "22321" is 15KB & user entered "543" which is less 5 bytes, whats going to happen? Assume "22321" represent a port number so user is expected to enter data from 0 to about 65###      Any idea?

20090225123833AAhPf2V	Computers & Internet;Security	Computer blocked at many points?	This relates to a friend's xp computer. He called me in despair and I went to see what was happening and it was in a mess.       The restore point doesn't work, its window opens but there is nothing in it, the Avast antivirus doesn't work, the internet connection is cut and even the keyboard doesn't work.       Some programs open up but many give error messages of failed initialisation like wsastartup0 failed, afxsocketINIT failed, windows initiation sock failed, error basinit library check out INI file.       Also at the start there is this error:       svchost.exe application error   instruction at 0x7d4caa3b referenced memory at 0x00000010 the memory could not bead.       The desktop takes about three minutes to load and the media player says it can't find a sound device.      But some programs, the task manager and the mouse work.       So is this due to a very potent virus or did he inadvertanly erase vital registry keys through an overaggressive registry cleaner?       About 15% of the HDD is free.

The error message reads,      "E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.    E: _cache->open() failed, please report."       However, whenever I run 'dpkg --configure -a in terminal, it says 'requested operation requires superuser privilege'.      How can I fix this?

I accidentally bought DVD-R's, when I use DVD+R's a 4GB disc burns in about 8 minutes,  with the DVD-R's it's taking almost 25 mins and it's only burning at 2x.      Why the difference?      (I'm using a Matshita DVD-R UJ-845 burner and Toast Titanium as the software if it makes a difference)
