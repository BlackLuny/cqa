First, it is NOT a name that Gould used for macroevolution ... it is just a part of macroevolution ... and discusses only the *pace* of evolution.  And second, he did NOT say that there was "long periods of time between evolutionary changes" ... he said that evolutionary changes are happening all the time, but that the *pace* of production of major new taxa (genera, orders, families, phyla, etc.) can accelerate at different times.<br>  <br>  >"try to stay away from wikipedia"<br>  <br>  ??? You are blaming wikipedia for the way this asker deliberately misinterpreted it!   I don't see anything whatsoever on that wikipedia page that is inaccurate, or does not reflect the scientific definition of polyploidy.   Do you?<br>  <br>  The problem is not with accuracy of the wikipedia page, but with this asker's deliberate and dishonest misinterpretation of it by saying that polyploidy is "crucial to evolution."   It has certainly never been considered "crucial" to evolution *in mammals*, so his cherry-picking of the section on polyploidy in animals (and still getting it wrong) is just deliberate deception.<br>  <br>  And there is no mention of autism or schizophrenia anywhere on that wikipedia page.  Perhaps idk is referring to the known connections between duplications or deletions of *specific genes* or DNA (copy number variations) that have been linked to autism or schizophrenia. But then at best he has taken an isolated case of one type of duplication or deletion of *specific genes* and concluded that *ALL* duplications *MUST* be bad ... which is an absurd leap that could only come from someone with no understanding whatsoever of genetics, science, or basic *logic*.<br>  <br>  So don't blame wikipedia for the absurd way this asker has taken a wikipedia page and completely and dishonestly misinterpreted it!|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Actually, that is patently false.

ebQJsYTxaa	Yes. The bird flu vaccine contains 50 mcg of mercury, which is twice the amount in the regular flu shots.  50 mcg of mercury is a huge amount.  Compare 50 mcg with 0.3 mcg, which is the "trace" amount of mercury in many vaccines now.  The bird flu vaccine contains 167 times more mercury than most mercury-containing vaccines.  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/label/h5n1san041707LB.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cber/label/h5n1san041...</a> (page 12)|`|ab5eb6c79489fdbbacde1ce1372f5f98aa	First of all I'm not even sure if there is a vaccine for bird flu available on the market.  Secondly, i doubt they would use it or if they have to it will be used in extremely small quantities because they have removed it from just about every other vaccine.  By the way, thimerosal is relatively harmless because the type of mercury containing compound used is quickly flushed out of the system.  Mercury in blood and urine is non-detectable and the only place researchers have found it in notable quantities is in the stool of patients who have received thimerosal containing vaccines.

Once oxygen is in the blood, it is bound to the hemoglobin of red blood cells. The heart pumps, pushing the oxygen-rich blood through vessels to all the parts of the body.

BoUeBvYQaa	The equation:<br>  <br>    (work done) = Force × distance<br>  <br>  ...is a little misleading.  It's only strictly true in the case where the distance moved is parallel to the direction of the force.  In cases where the distance  and the force are not in parallel directions, you need to use just the component of the distance which is parallel to the force.  In your example the force was vertical (i.e. the stairs pushing directly up on you against gravity), so the only distance you should consider is the vertical distance (i.e. your change in height).<br>  <br>  Of course, this is not accounting for the forces of friction, and the fact that your body is not a 100% efficient machine.  When you take those considerations into account, the actual amount of work you did was somewhat greater than (weight × height).|`|4wX9KOhIaa	distance=(height^2+length^2)^1/2<br>  It is important to remember that vertical movement requires more work due to the effects of gravity, so it may be better to consider the components separately.|`|VN2BbmNZaa	I have heard that walking up twelve flights of stairs is equal to walking a mile.

YHNK9UrQaa	1. Plants and animals that live in the water have a simpler reproductive process than plants and animals that live on land because their sperm can travel through the water to find a suitable egg.  Land plants need pollination by wind, birds or insects, and land animals need courtship and mating to get their gametes in place for fertilization.<br>  <br>  2. Many kinds of fish are easily produced in fish hatcheries because it is easy to get a great deal of sperm and a great many eggs from those fish and put the sperm and eggs together.  Fertilization is simple, no special incubators are required, and no one has to teach the young how to find food, find mates, or build nests, etc..<br>  <br>  3. Egg cells in birds relatively few in number and large in size because birds go for quality rather than quantity.  Most birds put a lot of energy into raising their young (i.e., nest building, incubating, feeding, teaching) rather than just dumping a bunch of eggs or a bunch of sperm into the lake water (or ocean) and being unconcerned about how things might (or might not) work out.  Birds wouldn't have the energy to raise more than a few offspring.

iTetA3oCaa	Often the cost of fuel is the largest input into raising a crop.  Fuel and fertilizer outweigh the cost of seed.  Not too long ago I handled a bunch of yearling cattle on grass for a feedlot.  The cost of fuel on those cattle cost more than the grass they ate.  High prices for food are more due to the cost of fuel than due to what the farmer receives.|`|1l8KBXsbaa	Gas and fuel are directly tied to agriculture. In the US, most agriculture is highly mechanized and therefore requires rather large amounts of fuel. Tractors and harvesters use large quantities of fuel to produce the crop, as well as the large amount of natural gas often used to dry some crops and the fuel required to take crops to market. Fuel is a major cost used in formulating budgets for different crops and often influences what farming practices are used as the price changes (such as what tillage you want to use or if you will no-till.) Also, more fuel is being made out of agricultural products due to the rise of ethanol made from corn and bio-diesel made from soybeans.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Being a farmer and rancher myself, I can tell you that the price of fuel has a huge impact on agriculture / my operation.  In farming, I am constantly using big equipment...whether it is my tractor (used for plowing, sowing, pulling the grain cart, planting, etc) or my combine (used for harvesting wheat, corn, and grain sorghum) or my spray rig (used for pest control) or my semi truck (used for hauling wheat, corn, grain sorghum, cattle, or hay / feed), fuel is a ~major~ factor / concern.  Especially these days when profit margins are so tight to begin with, a rise in fuel can easily make the difference between profit and no profit.<br>  With ranching, fuel is factored into the cost of operating the feed trucks and the semi trucks (to haul cattle).|`|6XIDmojtaa	it relates directly because it takes fuel to run the tractor to till the field, and seed and pump water to irrigate . then more fuel to harvest with combines , power the trucks to bring crops to the mill and power trains to take to processing plants so on and so forth.

BFmwdAkpaa	The watershed itself is not necessarily important to all wildlife...The watershed is often used as a unit of area in ecology and wildlife biology, which is a more biologically relevant way to delineate units of area that, say, a town or a sate. This practice hs become more common over the past decade or so...So in that regard, the watershed is an important concept in studying and researching wildlife.<br>  A more appropriate question might be: Why is the health of a watershed important to wildlife?  Well, all organisms depend on water in some way, and the cleanliness of that water is important. The health of a watershed could be measured in many ways (water quality, road density, amount of development, presence of sensitive aquatic organisms), and a watershed's health can be degraded in many ways, through pollution, development, acid rain, etc...So the quality of a watershed might be a good indicator of how well the wildlife populations within it are doing. <br>  <br>  Every square inch of terrestrial land is included in some watershed, even deserts. The determination has to do with direction of water flow either above and/or below ground.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	All lifeforms require water for survival.  The more water the better the survival of life forms.  Watersheds retain water from precipitation and allow storage of the water during times when there is no precipitation.  So they are reservoirs of water, much in the soil, which provides food for wildlife in the form of vegetation and animals etc.  Deserts are the opposite of watersheds and are largely devoid of wildlife.
KJHw0oI3aa	If I understand you correctly, you want to write net ionic equations for each of the above reactions.  By the way, hydrochloric acid is completely ionized in the water solution, so it is present as both H+(aq) and Cl-(aq) ions.  The reaction if any occurs between the metallic ion and the chloride ion.  The hydrogen ion is a spectator ion.  If the combination is soluble, no visible reaction occurs.  If the product is insoluble, a precipitate is formed.<br>  <br>  Ag+(aq)  + Cl-(aq) --> AgCl(s)<br>  Pb2+(aq) + 2 Cl-(aq) --> PbCl2(s)<br>  Fe3+(aq) + Cl-(aq) --> NO REACTION<br>  Ni2+(aq) + Cl-(aq) --> NO REACTION<br>  NH4+(aq) + Cl-(aq) --> NO REACTION

RgSCstkAaa	Both the mean and the standard deviation are calculated from a set of data. You cannot change either without altering the original data. If you want a set of data with the same standard deviation but a different mean, then add or subtract the same constant value to each element of your set of data. To get a data set with a different standard deviation and the same mean is a little more difficult. For each element you need to find its difference from the mean and multiply that by a constant to give the new element.|`|IkIRY71Gaa	Changing mean without changing the sd: shift all values up or down the same amount, so that they're all still the same distance from eachother.

For example, if the original data are 3, 4, 7, 9, 7, the mean is 6 and the population standard deviation is 2.19089.  If you add the same number, say 10, to each data point, you'd have 13, 14, 17, 19, 17 which has a mean of 6+10 or 16 and the same standard deviation.<br>  <br>  To change the standard deviation without changing the mean, increase one data point by any number, say 1, and then decrease another data point by the same number.

x384qQ3Iaa	Since this is multiple choice, lets use 10 m/s^2 as the acceleration due to gravity.  The trick is to look at the momentum of the system after 2 seconds.  So for the heavy ball, after two seconds, it has a velocity of -20 m/s. Thus it has a momentum of -10 kg*m/s.  The light ball will have a velocity of -5 m/s (15m/s going up minus 20 m/s due to gravity gives 5 m/s downward). So it has a momentum of -1.25 kg*m/s.  In both cases, the negative sign indicates the momentum is downward, and the sum is -11.25 kg*m/s.  Find the velocity of the system by dividing by the total mass (0.75 kg) and you get 15 m/s down.

At STP it is attacked by aqua regia, forming chloroauric acid and by alkaline solutions of cyanide but not by hydrochloric, nitric or sulphuric acids. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, but does not react with it. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which will dissolve silver and base metals, and is the basis of the gold refining technique known as "inquartation and parting".

I don't think it take 2 seconds to do one sit up though.  That would only be 30 sit ups in one minute and I think most people can do more than that. I've heard that a person with average health can do about 45 a minute which means it would take you .75 of a second to do one sit up. If you did 2000 sit ups and each one only took you that long you could be done in 25 minutes.|`|yikZNA7aaa	well most people can do about 100 full sit-ups in a minute, so your time per sit-up is probably off because it usually takes less than a second to do a sit-up.

If after cutting, you are allowed to put the cut pieces one on on top of the other, and the next cut goes through all the pieces, then the answer is 2^9 or 512.<br>  <br>  However, if all the pieces have to lie flat on the pizza tray until the cutting is complete, then the maximum is only 46, and some of the pieces are pretty small. This assumes that all the cuts do NOT go through the centre. The strategy is to draw lines which intersect all the previous lines, whereupon the number of pieces after each cut forms a series 2,4,7,11,16... where the arithmetical difference between successive elements increases by 1 each time.|`|SIGvaB1jaa	If you run the knife across the center of the pizza 9 times you will get 18 pieces.|`|lxouDjtqaa	If you can get each cut to cross every other cut, you can double the number of pieces each time, so the first cut gives you 2, the second 4, etc.<br>  2 to the ninth power is the number you get to, or 512<br>  <br>  <br>  All those who say 18 are assuming your cut must always go through the center.

A negligible amount.<br>  Does that answer your question?|`|swWg9TGDaa	Absolutely, though its probably more feasible to actually send someone out there (whats the use of a mirror if theres no one to look in to it). We couldn't see earths past by staring into a distant mirror from earth as the "time" the light took travelling back would cancel out the "time" take off.<br>  <br>  If you were travelling to a distant point in the univese, As you got further and further away from earth it takes light from earth longer and longer to reach you and so you see earth further and further back in time. <br>  <br>  There is of course one major problem - We cannot travel far enough or fast enough yet. It takes 8 minutes for light to travel between earth and the sun. If you were travelling away from earth at the speed of light then the earth would appear to freeze in time as you'd be travelling at the same speed as the light leaving earth. It wouldn't be until you stopped that you'd start seeing earth in the past. It's theoretically possible but a practical impossibility with current tehnology.

jjKCjWzZaa	For any domestic elevator, without a counter weight, for moving upwards, higher force is required and going down wards, a brake is required. If we have a counter weight equal to the average weight of men to be carried, then motor power can be nearly halved, no braking required for down ward travel. Here our aim is to have equal power requirement for both upward and down ward movement.<br>  <br>  Such counterweight are common for manual lifting of water using a bucket. Here we have to use force to bring the bucket down, but only around half the force is required to bring the water up.

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	I think,by humidity, you mean relative humidity.The relative humidity is maximum(100 %) when the air becomes saturated.If the air becomes saturated,condensation of water vapour (present in the air)occurs leading to the formation of tiny water droplets.Millions of such water droplets come together to form clouds.Under certain conditions such water droplets combine to form big rain drops which fall as precipitation due to gravity.So,if the humidity is more(or relative humidity becomes maximum),it leads to the formation of clouds and subsequent precipitation.  <br>  I would like to add one more thing.Usually condensation of water vapor into water droplets takes place only in the presence of what is called condensation nuclei.These are dust ,smoke,particles of salt,droplets of sulfuric acid etc.Among these,salt and sulfuric acid have affinity for water and are therefore called hygroscopic nuclei.If these hygroscopic nuclei are abundant in the atmosphere,condensation can take place even when the relative humidity is as low as 70 %.|`|s115uaybaa	humitidy is water in the air. precipitation is the amount of buildup  on the surface of things

94faf4d1d380dfc7f0731bbb8873018eaa	Resonance is a natural frequency of vibration of an object. If an oscillator sens waves to an object at its resonant frequency it will vibrate with oscillations of a large size or amplitude.<br>  The sharpness of resonance defines the range of frequencies over which the object resonates i.e. f(resonant) +/- half the range of resonance.<br>   If the amplitude of oscillations created by sending waves at a frequency just a little below or just above the resonant frequency leads to a weak response i.e. the amplitude/size of the oscillations decrease rapidly as you move the excitation frequency away from the resonant frequency you can say the the width of the frequency response is narrow and the shape of the response vs. frequency curve could be described as very peaked or sharp.

(If not, then `circular arc' doesn't make much sense.)<br>  <br>  The work done is zero because the strength of the electric field at all the points in it's path is the same, so the electron has no more and no less energy than it did before.  If the electron were to move closer to or further from the rod, then there would be some work done.<br>  <br>  The strength of an electric field a given distance from a point charge is proportional to 1/r^2.  The strength of an electric field a given distance from an infinitely long wire with a constant charge/length is 1/r.  A rod is somewhere in between those two (it depends on the ratio of r to the length of the rod) but even so, it only depends on r, and if r doesn't change, no work is done.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Not all rock erodes at the same rate. When soft rock is eroded by a stream, the water plunges from the hard rock upstream down to where the softer rock had been. If you look at a historical map showing the locations of the old mills, they usually form a line (fall line) separating the Piedmont from the Coastal Plain. Streams with no mills often have waterfalls along this line.
7KOqTYYLaa	From the flow of the water hitting an obstacle and eroding the bank into a meander.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	Meanders form in a random fashion, usually due to small obstacles like different textures of soil and rocks.  Vegetation can help form meanders as the force of the flow of the stream is not strong and any obstruction will cause the stream to change course.  In some cases the silt load of the water in a stream will be sufficient that when the flow rate drops below a carrying capacity, the silt is deposited at some point and builds up so that once deposited, it is less likely to be picked up again and this tends to cause the stream to be deflected.  In the midwest states you can see a lot of what are called "Oxbows" due to their shape.  What happens is often high water flow rates cut through the original obstruction and the river changes course again.  Currents in rivers provide enough turbulence to cause silt to be suspended but at locations where the current diminishes sufficiently, the ability to suspend silt diminishes and the silt is deposited.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	rivers go into flat plains and its easier to change courses|`|YRRXtVXeaa	BY GODS HAND

iaCfBwaSaa	The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the passage of a steady electrical current. Its reciprocal quantity is electrical conductance measured in siemens. An object of uniform cross section will have a resistance proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, and proportional to the resistivity of the material.<br>  <br>  Discovered by Georg Ohm in the late 1820s, electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the mechanical notion of friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm, symbol Ω.<br>  <br>  The resistance of a resistive object determines the amount of current through the object for a given potential difference across the object, in accordance with Ohm's law:<br>  <br>   <br>  where I=V/R<br>  <br>  R is the resistance of the object, measured in ohms, equivalent to J·s/C2 <br>  V is the potential difference across the object, measured in volts <br>  I is the current through the object, measured in amperes <br>  For a wide variety of materials and conditions, the electrical resistance does not depend on the amount of current through or the amount of voltage across the object, meaning that the resistance R is constant for the given temperature. Therefore, the resistance of an object can be defined as the ratio of voltage to current:<br>  R=V/I<br>   <br>  In the case of nonlinear objects (not purely resistive, or not obeying Ohm's law), this ratio can change as current or voltage changes; the ratio taken at any particular point, the inverse slope of a chord to an I–V curve, is sometimes referred to as a "chordal resistance" or "static resistance".|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	In order to understand what is resistance, It is best to consider a hydrostatic analogy. If we allow water to  flow along a horizontal tube from a constant level tank. We find that the fluid  flows with constant speed. Now we know that the individual molecules constantly change their velocities in magnitude and direction. Still the mass motion seems to be so orderly and proportional to the height difference. With electrons in a metal are in random motion inside. But when connected to a constant potential difference move in mass motion of constant velocity as if some charges are moving. A potential difference produces a force on the average electron which appear to move with constant velocity proportional to the potential difference. Similar thing happens for the flow of fluids. Although gravitational   attraction applies constant force, the charges seem to move with constant velocity proprtional to the constant new force.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Any opposition to the flow of electrons in a circuit.

"-ic" indicates its highest charge.  <br>  <br>  Some common multivalent metals; 2 charges for each element, showing both the roman numeral style and the latin word:<br>  <br>  Iron (Fe): Iron (II) or Ferrous; Iron (III) or Ferric. <br>  Lead (Pb): Lead (II) or Plumbous; Lead (IV) or Plumbic <br>  Copper (Cu): Copper (I) or Cuprous; Copper (II) or Cupric <br>  Tin (Sn): Tin (II) or Stannous; Tin (IV) or Stannic

lkNJNnlSaa	It is a double Helix held by hydrogen bonds.<br>  <br>  These Hydrogen bonds break in Protein Synthesis and the Helix uncoils exposing the DNA strands<br>  <br>  This DNA strand acts as a TEMPLATE for RNA nucleotides to form a chain of mRNA.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	DNA, via mRNA, directs the order of amino acids in the final protein.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	The sequence of bases on a strand of DNA determines the eventual sequence of amino acids in the protein. The DNA code is carried off by mRNA, a single stranded molecule which forms complementary base pairs with part of a DNA molecule on one side only. This process is called transcription. The mRNA then moves out of the nucleus and attatches to a ribosome, where tRNA carries the corresponding anti-codons (a codon is a sequence of 3 bases) to join up with mRNA. Peptide bonds form between the adjacent amino acids (3 bases long) to form a polypeptide, which is another name for protein.|`|FRJoKiA0aa	DNA is 'unzipped' using an enzyme called Helicase. A side of the unravelled helix is used as a template to form messenger RNA as only certain bases will form complimentary hydrogen bonds to other bases. The mRNA is effectively a 'negative' of the DNA strand and then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes for the translation stage of protein synthesis.
4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	Starting point, DNA has 4 bases which may come in any order.<br>  <br>  First, the double helix can open up and the bases in any particular gene can be transcribed into mRNA. This is a single helix in which the base thymine is replaced by uracil. At this point the information, base order has been read and in being transcribed to mRNA, the information can now be carried from the nucleus (in eukaryotic cells) to the cytoplasm.<br>  <br>  Second, the mRNA which contains the necessary information binds to rRNA in ribosomes and the information is now read a second time, in groups of 3 bases called codons. Each codon can bind to a third molecule of RNA called tRNA which carries the complimentary codon sequence called an anticodon and the other part of the tRNA molecule  carries the corresponding amino acid which then binds to other amino acids to form a protein chain. THis process is translation.<br>  <br>  In summary - bases in specific order - transcribed to mRNA and carried to nucleus - translated to protein by rRNA and tRNA. Information stored as bases is turned into useful proteins.|`|FRJoKiA0aa	In DNA, there are 4 nitrogenous bases that are adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Adenine forms complimentary hydrogen bonding to the thymine bases and cytosine forms complimentary hydrogen bonding to the guanine. This specific bonding means the different bases can be used in different layouts to code for proteins. Proteins are made of amino acids, base units which each have a respective code which is just 3 of these units in a certain order e.g. Serine is UCC. There are only 20 essential amino acids but 4^3 triplet unique combinations is 64 combos. The RNA in blood reads these triplet codes and subtitutes in an amino acid for every triplet. These amino acids build up into the polypeptide (I've simplified the process).|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Three base nucleotides make up a frame, each frame represents an amino acid, many  amino acids create proteins, and each protein has a function to perform. <br>  <br>  You can think of a frame as a word and each word has a specific meaning in a sentence.  Many words from many sections on the DNA molecule make up the instructions of inheritance.

In other words, if a body of water is polluted, mayflies won't live there, so they're a good indicator of the health of a particular body of water.<br>  <br>  However, if mayflies are adversely affected by the velocity of a river, the river might not be polluted, but mayflies won't live there anyways.  So it's important to know how mayflies are affected by river velocity.  Otherwise, we might assume that a particular river is polluted, when it's really just running too fast or too slow for mayflies to survive.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Mayflys if I remember need relatively slow moving water for reproduction.

So to quickly answer your questions:<br>  1. one missed dose is no big deal but return to your normal dosing schedule as soon as possible<br>  2. you can take them at any time of day, but it is best to take them at the same time every day.

So the number of moles of HCl in this volume = number of moles HCl needed to react all the Na2CO3<br>  <br>  Molarity = moles / litres<br>  Therefore moles = molarity x litres<br>  moles HCl = 0.020 M x 0.02260 L<br>  = 0.000452 moles of HCl needed to react all the Na2CO3<br>  <br>  Now, calculate how many moles of Na2CO3 this amount of HCl will react with.

qJ52Y9Auaa	They're not exactly the same... Mechanism of action is referring to the mechanism on how how the drug exerts its therapeutic or intended effect. i.e. the drug captopril (for high blood pressure) is an ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), which its MOA is to inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is responsible for vasoconstriction, increasing sympathetic activity, and sodium reabsorption, which all cause your blood pressure to increase. <br>  <br>  Mechanism of toxicity is how the drug causes toxic effects. Almost all drugs will cause side effects since they alter the normal function of your body. An example of a mechanism of toxicity is when you over dose on a drug and your body can't metabolism the drug quick enough, so the drug builds up in your body and cause side (some toxic) effects based on the drug's effect on the body. This can be done when taking two drugs that both treat the same medical condition, but through a different mechanism of action. Take the above example of Captopril for hypertension... You can take additional drugs for hypertension that have a different MOA. i.e. hydrochlorothiazide's (diuretic) MOA on treating hypertension is that it blocks the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions, and thereby increases the quantity of sodium traversing the distal tubule and the volume of water excreted. The more water excreted, the lower your blood pressure will be. Now, if your blood pressure is not really high and you are taking multiple anithypertensive drugs, they can cause a severe drop in blood pressure since the multiple drugs are lowering your blood pressure via different mechanisms of action.|`|P4cvrMxgaa	Sometimes yes, sometimes no.<br>  <br>  Someting like warfarin has the same mechanism of toxicity as mechanism of action.  This is usually only true of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges.  This could also be the case with antiarrhythmics, as they can cause new arrhythmias.<br>  <br>  Something like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) has a mechanism of action of blocking histamine release, but has a mechanism of toxicity of causing sedation.
1Sqz8Xifaa	Ethanol = Ch3CH2OH and Ethane = CH3CH3.<br>  <br>  The hydroxyl group of Ethanol makes the molecule much more reactive. Since water can act as a weak acid, the reactivity of the -OH group can interact with it. This can be seen in the pKa values, or reactivity values of these molecules.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	A hydroxyl group is a very polar group, due to the electronegativity difference between the O and the H atoms. Also, due to its bent structure, the dipole set up is not cancelled out by another dipole. This makes ethanol a polar molecule, which is easy to dissolve in water.<br>  <br>  Ethane has only C-H bonds, which, by their nature, are not very polar. Also, all dipole moments cancel out due to the symmetry of the ethane molecule, making it a non-polar structure. Non-polar structures rarely, if ever, dissolve in water.
E11gNiGNaa	There are different ways to express the conservation of energy, depending on the system.  If there were no friction on the roller coaster (unrealistic), there would just be an interchange between mechanical potential energy and kinetic energy.<br>  <br>          change in PE + change in KE = 0<br>  <br>  However, there is work done by friction in the real case, so you need to express the relationship<br>  <br>           change in PE + change in KE + W(f) = 0<br>  <br>  Thus the change in KE will be less than the change in potential energy with the difference going into work done by friction.

IJWG1NfZaa	For simplification I'm going to assume this is a fairly high tank. So the answer would be no, the child cannot see at the top of the tank. The reason is the light is entering from a medium of lower refraction (the air n=1.0) to the water (n=1.33). Imagine seeing the child standing on the left of the tank. Draw a line to the edge of the glass representing the 50 degree angle. Then draw a line perpendicular to the side of the fish tank that touches the 50 degree line. This is the "normal" line. When light enters the fish tank, the portion that refracts bends towards the normal line. So the child will see the back of the fish tank. I hope this doesn't sound confusing. It would be so much easier to show with a picture.

An apprenticeship period of at least a year is required for all trainer positions, even with previous experience.<br>  Our requirements for animal trainers include:<br>  ° must be at least 18 years of age<br>  ° prior experience training animals<br>  ° public speaking, drama, or other performance and communication skills (a microphone test is part of the interview process)<br>  ° experience working with animals<br>  ° scuba diving certification<br>  ° CPR certification<br>  ° an ability to interact with the public<br>  ° academic coursework in zoology, marine biology, animal behavior or psychology (preference is given to those applicants with a college degree)<br>  ° strong swimming skills (part of the interview process is a rigorous swim test that includes a 200 ft. freestyle swim, a 100 ft. underwater swim, and a free-dive to the bottom of a 26 ft. pool.)<br>  ° excellent physical health and the ability to lift 50 lbs.<br>  In addition, even with previous training experience, new trainers are hired as associate trainers, and learn about SeaWorld’s training methods and animals in at least a one-year apprenticeship period.<br>  <br>  HOW TO GET EXPERIENCE<br>  To try and see if a career in animal training or animal care is for you, SeaWorld offers a weeklong Career Camp for grades 9-12 during the summer at all three parks. Check online at SWBG-AdventureCamps.com for more information.<br>  Many colleges and universities offer internship opportunities along with the local zoos or aquariums as part of a zoological science or similar type of degree program. Moorpark College in Southern California offers a special Exotic Animal Training and Management program designed for those who want to enter into zoological careers. In Florida, Santa Fe Community College and Pensacola Junior College offer similar programs. Volunteering at a local animal shelter, veterinarian, or wildlife rescue facility is another great way to get experience. In addition, many zoos and aquariums have docent or other volunteer positions available. It is also helpful to gain experience at the park or facility that you’re interested in working for. At SeaWorld, many of our openings for trainer and animal care positions go to applicants that have worked at the park in another department such as education - so this is a great way to get your foot in the door.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind is when position openings are available. At SeaWorld, we have most openings for trainers and animal care in the early spring, and usually post these positions on our website (www.becjobs.com) in late winter. During this time we hold the swim tests and microphone tests as the initial parts of the interview process.<br>  As you can imagine, we get hundreds of applicants each year for trainer positions. For killer whale trainers there may only be one or two openings each year— so this is an even more competitive area to get into. While a college degree is not currently required, those applicants that have a degree in marine biology, animal behavior, zoology, psychology, or related fields are almost always the ones that get interviews. Also, the swim test and microphone test are critical parts of the interview process. Most people who take these tests do not pass the underwater swim portion of this test, so it is critical to practice for this.<br>  The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (www.aza.org) also posts career information and job openings on its website. We also have a lot more info on our website (www.swbg-animals.org) about training and other animal careers. Other great sites to check out are the websites for the International Marine Animal Training Association (www.imata.org) and the Society for Marine Mammalogy (this has an excellent section on pursuing a career in marine mammal science at<br>  <a href="http://www.marinemammalogy.org/strat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marinemammalogy.org/strat.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuXz3YoBVObGo_WXZ4nLBWnty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090129111815AADcvKW&show=7#profile-info-qlOx8wK6aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  I want to become a whale trainer?|`|WPPIaLORaa	Since there are very few people who currently do it, I would assume that it is nearly impossible to plan to become a whale trainer.

687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Many Road crews apply salt to slippery surfaces in winter.  The salt melts the ice and snow down to around 15 deg.  The melted water dilutes the salt and it loses it strength to keep the water liquid. the water settles in cracks, crevices, and poorly sealed past pot-hole repairs.  The weakened salt-water then freezes, (while still below a freezing temperature), causing the expanding action to fracture existing concrete and asphalt.|`|MPavjXO6aa	pot holes form in roads mostly due to the expansion/contraction of moisture resident in the road surface.<br>  <br>  More accurately pot holes form because most municipalities do not proactively manage their transportation infrastructure; roads have a finite life span.

If not managed properly, a roadway can exceed its intended lifespan, and without repair or reconditioning will cease to provide the public with a surface suitable for wheeled vehicles.|`|HltUWMgOaa	Water gets between the stones and tar in the road surface.

Indeed, certain cities are said to have two seasons - winter and pothole repair. What causes these potholes to form, and why can't they be prevented in the first place? The answer involves both nature and the limitations of road construction.<br>  <br>  Most roadways are built in layers, starting with compacted earth and gravel for drainage. Some older city streets may even have a subsurface of bricks. All of these layers are covered with asphalt, which is a gooey blend of tar, oil byproducts, curatives and aggregate gravel. In an ideal setting, this layer of asphalt repels rainfall and snow, forcing it into drains or the shoulder of the road.<br>  <br>  Potholes form because asphalt road surfaces eventually crack under the heat of the day and the constant stresses of traffic. These cracks allow snow and rainwater to seep into the underlying dirt and gravel. During cold winter nights, this water freezes and expands. Some of the dirt and gravel is pushed out as a result, leaving a hole when the water eventually melts. Drivers continue to drive over these unseen holes, putting even more stress on the thin asphalt layer covering them.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the asphalt layer over these divots collapses, creating the traffic hazards we call potholes. Potholes can cause significant damage to a car's suspension system or tires if the driver fails to avoid them. Potholes can also fill with water, obscuring any other hazards they may contain. Even in places where the air temperature rarely falls below freezing, excessive rainfall or flooding can also cause potholes to form.<br>  <br>  Road maintenance crews have two different forms of repair methods for potholes. These repairs are roughly similar to a dentist using either a temporary or permanent filling material for cavities. During the winter months, potholes receive what is known as a cold winter mix. This is a temporary fix consisting of a soft asphalt poured into the potholes after they have been cleared of debris. A layer of gravel may be added to increase strength and stability, but the potholes are often expected to reappear by spring.<br>  <br>  A more permanent fix for potholes is called a hot summer mix. This combination of roadgrade asphalt and aggregate is designed to last for years, but it can only be applied during dry, warm weather. When road crews use a hot summer mix to repair potholes, they often reroute traffic around the worksite and spend more time preparing the road surface for the patch. The finished layer of new asphalt is usually compacted to match the level of the road, rendering it nearly invisible.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	The salt they put down and the friction from car tires melts the snow and ice.  As water, it can get into even the tiniest cracks.  THEN as the evening turns to night, there's less traffic and more cold weather moves in.  That water freezes.  What happens when water turns to ice?  It expands, right?<br>  <br>  So, imagine it ... water in a tight crack or crevice suddenly begins expanding.  It puts pressure on the the side of the crevice.  Over time, this pressure causes new breaks and breaches.  Cars and trucks compound the problem by running over them, breaking away bits of the road.  The combination of the snow and cold, the salt, and friction, and the refreezing is quite effective.  <br>  <br>  Instant potholes!|`|5XFGNmVuaa	In addition to Mark H, I would add that snow plows also cause a lot of the damage, especially when the road is already damaged from the freezing and expanding water.

This melt water then freezes overnight and as we all know, ice expands.  This expansion of the ice in the cracks in the road surface then leads to larger cracking.  Small holes may appear where more ice forms and the same expanding process continues until we get bucket sized potholes.<br>  <br>  The road outside my house looks like we've have a bombing run, must be a couple of dozen two feet wide potholes.<br>  <br>  I expect the council will send round the usual team of navvies to fix the holes sometime in 2012 - we'll need to smarten the place up just in case anyone visits this part of London during the Olympics thing.|`|vFHXrOHNaa	Most roadways are built in layers, starting with compacted earth and gravel for drainage.

3ZPYB7nxaa	I'm going to assume the discussion is about Americans.<br>  <br>  American culture is the major impediment to human powered transportation. Unlike Europe, America is vast and this gave rise to the development of mechanical means of transportation which overcame the large distances between cities. The development of personal mechanical transportation (the automobile) set a series of developmental trends into motion which are not easy to change overnight. Most American businesses are spread out and organized such that automobile transportation is the most efficient (not to mention safest!) way of getting there. This is in contrast to European towns where traditional pre-industrial city planning clustered residential areas and shopping sites closely together, allowing foot travel from home to business. Because of their small size, European countries also had most cities under 100 miles of one another, unlike America where this distance is ordinarly measured in many hundreds of miles. <br>  <br>  One other factor in America is the power of marketing. America is the most market driven society on earth. Americans listen to advertising with the same fervor a European might listen to their local religious leader. Americans "believe" in having automobiles and go so far as to concider the lack of one a sign of poverty. <br>  <br>  India is perhaps a model of what American transportation might become if our technology allows the planet to support what might be a comparable American population of 2 billion. India is potentially vast in size but has literally filled the space with people. There are probably few places in India where a person can go and be out of easy walking distance of another person. The cities are teeming with people, many of them on bicycles simply because autos are cramped onto narrow streets and simply don't have the space to move freely around. India has an enormous railway system which allows people to get to other cities if long distance travel is needed. Granted, economics also plays a large factor, since the average citizen isn't affluent enough to afford a car. Even if they were, India would still not have the space for its current population and an equal number of cars. The average car takes hundreds of times the space an average person does to move around freely and although this is still available in America, in India it is not.|`|hRI8iouoaa	the power a person can put out is about 500 watts.

qaMPEdL2aa	Assume with that acceleration, all the weight of the car is on the drive wheels.<br>  <br>  m g k = m * 11<br>  <br>  k = 11/9.8 = 1.12|`|x384qQ3Iaa	Draw a simple diagram of the car, noting that the force is applied where the rubber meets the road.  The force driving the car forward must be equal to the force due to friction with the road which given by the coefficient of static friction (mu) times the normal force (mass * acceleration due to gravity, g).  So you have the F-forward = F-friction which gives: mass * acceleration =  mu * F-normal = mu * mass * g.<br>  <br>  Lets simplify that a little:  mass * acceleration = mu * mass * g. Solve for mu, and you see the mass cancels, and you are left with mu = a/g which is about 1.1 (ie. 11 m/s^2 / 10 m/s^2).  Hope that makes sense.
YrOTZsjtaa	Any time an object moves along a circular path, a centripetal acceleration occurs. When the car is at the top of the arc, it is vertical, and the acceleration is straight down.

E4qNeHnvaa	Getting a PhD is a lengthy process and should be approached seriously.  The requirements (as in what specific classes you will take) will differ between each school, and it will also change depending on what area of Mathematics you want to study. <br>  <br>  Typical doctoral programs take five to seven years to complete (this is after an undergraduate collegiate degree); by the time you are done, you will have spent about one-quarter of your life in graduate school. In many fields your training will not be done; <br>  <br>  PhD work in any field is quite challenging. One must usually have a clearly defined major, perform well on the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) in both one’s specialty and in the general test, and have excellent grades, recommendations and scholastic history in order to get into a PhD program.<br>  <br>  In most cases, those achieving a PhD in science or a liberal art will spend anywhere from one to three years studying advanced coursework in their chosen subject. Generally, time spent on coursework tends to be less if one has earned a Master’s degree first. These advanced studies may eliminate the need to take certain courses. <br>  <br>  So the steps you need are:<br>  - Math Related Bachelor degree (Mathematics, Physics, etc.)<br>  - Recommendation by collegiate professors<br>  - Good Scores on the GRE<br>  - A vision and a reason for pursuing degree.|`|sU2y5VcPaa	Undergraduate in college take classes covering calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and multi-variable calculus.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you're familiar with real analysis, complex analysis, and abstract algebra.<br>  <br>  You take the GRE for graduate/phd school, you should be scoring above the 80th percentile.<br>  <br>  Speak with high school advisers about what colleges are right to get you set up for grad school (some undergrad schools have better math departments than others) and when you get there, go talk to an adviser about the best course route to take to get into grad school. <br>  <br>  Those are the basic things you're gonna need to know really well to get into a good mathematics graduate program.|`|VLT2VgP9aa	It depends on the area of research you want to go into.  If you major in math in college, you can usually choose an applied or a pure concentration.  Applied math is generally more computational while pure math is more theoretical.  When I was working toward my degree, I started on applied math concentration, but later switched to pure math.  So, I have a pretty solid background in both.  As an undergrad, you'll have some choices as to which courses you want to take, but you are almost certainly going to have to take a few core classes, regardless of your concentration.  These will most likely include differential equations, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and real analysis, with number theory and complex analysis being other possibilities (I took both, but they weren't required).  In grad school, you'll work with an adviser who will help you decide which classes to take.  You'll almost certainly take more abstract algebra and real analysis, topology, complex analysis, and anything that is relevant to the area you want to go into.  By the time you've started working toward your Ph.D, you will have found an area of mathematics that you want to specialize in, and you'll prepare your dissertation within that particular field.<br>  <br>  I currently hold a B.A. in pure mathematics.  I doubt I'll ever go for the Ph.D, but I may go for a Master's.  While I still don't know enough to say with any certainty what my area of research would be, I am currently very interested in commutative algebra and semigroup theory, so I wouldn't be surprised if I eventually specialized in one of those areas.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	You will need to get a BS or maybe a BA degree in math and then some more courses and some original work in the field that you publish as your dissertation.

Pay no attention to them.|`|oQrIn41zaa	No you are not gonna die, it's because of hte end of the mayan calendar, no biggie. Here, read the article on the link below, it explains it better than I do:<br>  <br>  The Date: 21/12/2012:<br>  <br>  The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, notably used by the Maya civilization among others of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, completes its thirteenth b'ak'tun cycle since the calendar's mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, according to the "GMT-correlation" JDN= 584283). The Long Count b'ak'tun date of this starting point (13.0.0.0.0) is repeated, for the first time in a span of approximately 5,125 solar years. The significance of this period-ending to the pre-Columbian Maya themselves is unclear, and there is an incomplete inscription (Tortuguero Monument 6) that records this date. It is also to be found carved on the walls of the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, where it functions as a base date from which other dates are computed. This date figures prominently in the religious syncretism of New Age Mayanism. <br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  Geophysical and cosmological speculations<br>  John Major Jenkins and others believe that an alignment will occur when the sun rises above the horizon on December 21 2012, at which point the sun will rise in the middle of the Milky Way Galaxy, thus causing an alignment between the earth, sun, and the galactic center. It is suggested that this event will cause numerous changes on Earth. However, the event is only a visual phenomenon from the Earth's perspective, which is caused by the precession of the equinoxes or the 26,000 year wobble of the earth, and thus only changes our perspective, not the actual position of the earth in relation to the galaxy. In short, there is no gravitational force or radiation to be expected from this event because other than the tilt of the earth, nothing will be any different from what occurs in any other solstice.<br>  <br>  Michael Tsarion and others think that an actual physical alignment of our entire solar system will occur with the horizontal plane of the Milky Way Galaxy on that day. The solar system is moving around the center of the galaxy every 225 million years or so, and while doing so is moving up and down in a cycle crossing the plane every 33 million years. According to the Journal Nature, however, there is evidence of the solar system crossing the galactic plane 3 million years ago. This would mean that we are moving away from the galactic plane, not toward it, and we will not be due to cross it for another 30 million years.<br>  <br>  There are also theories that a currently unknown planet, sometimes referred to as planet x or Nibiru, which has an odd orbit that only enters the local solar system every 3600 years will return in 2012 causing many problems. The idea is traced back to Zecharia Sitchin's translations of Sumerian texts, and specifically to his interpretation of the VA 243 cylinder seal, which he says shows that the Sumerians knew of 12 planets (sun, moon, and ten others). This idea has been challenged by his peers, most notably Michael Heiser. And this idea was proven false by Astronomers in Finland in 2008.<br>  <br>  Among other possible scenarios is that a shift of the Earth's magnetic poles may occur, and that this will leave the earth vulnerable to harmful radiation from the sun. According to NASA magnetic pole reversal does not occur on a particular day or year, but over the course of thousands of years. Furthermore, the magnetic field does not vanish during this natural cycle, but becomes more complex as it makes the transition. This means that basically, we are gonna have around eight poles (like the two we have north and south atm...) around the world above the most highest populated areas, such as London, New York, Mumbai...all those v. major cities...gulp. One good thing outta this is that we'll have the northern lights in our skies at night, that's pretty exciting, this kinda major stuff will only take place around around the 2050s or so, so we have nothing to worry about, cause we'll be oldies then, well, we'll in around 50/60...which is meh. It's our future generations we gotta orry about. These poles mean that we'll be exposed to solar winds, this **** is real dangerous. We'll be okay I think. The population of the world is go down from around 8 bil to 6 or 7 bil, but it's not something we can avoid, at all, no physical way possibel atm.<br>  Our speices hasn't has much experience with this, none at all in a reversal at all, but we can tell by looking at rocks that whole speices have survived reversal. We were due for a reveral a thousand ish years ago, but it's coming pretty late, but it's happening, and it's the reason for a lot of stuff, such as weather change and bleh.<br>  <br>  Some proponents of the pole shift scenario claim that this shift would be a physical movement of the poles of the earth, and not simply a magnetic shift. This event is called a true polar wander. Earth has experienced a few degree shif|`|KvAqGXO0aa	21.

Gmvldblraa	You and the rug are neutral. You walk over the rug and some of your surface electrons leave you and stay (briefly) with the rug. You are now charged. But only on your surface - your dead skin surface. If the positive charges move from your feet ( technical word - migrate! ) they will still stay on the  surface.....because they repel each other and in trying to get as far from each other as possible, will always stay on the outside ( and with a big enough charge make your hair ( also dead) stand on end). So no your biochemistry will not be affected because the charges get nowhere near the important reactions.<br>  <br>  Acids ( and alkalies for  that matter ) are not "just positive charges". They are electrically neutral. They have equal numbers of positive and negative ions ( and the negative ions are NOT electrons ). Their reactivity ( danger ) comes from the fact that the +ve and –ve ions the acid is made of are not strongly bound together and so when in contact with some other substance the neutral acid molecules are likely to break up and form new compounds with the "other substance". If the other substance is your skin ( or your oesophagus lining - you DRANK IT!!?) then it will be chemically rearranged, and perhaps hurt.<br>  Most acids are not at all dangerous - DNA is an acid, how much less threatening can it get?<br>  Edit. Just seen "Jeff's" response. In case you don't realise - its just about total garbage. Its a failing of this format that inaccurate responses are not usually debated or corrected.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	electric charges are harmful if the charge is great enough but with small amounts the body discharges the current like length of wire. even a length of wire will melt is enough current passes through it. so don't play with 1 volt or more. it's not the voltage it's the current passing through you body that does the damage but 1 volt is enough to kill you in the right situation. you only need 1 amp of current and your bodies resistance is relatively low especially if you soaking wet in a thunder and lightning rain storm.

rrYsgJ20aa	I'm not going to outright give you the answer, since this is obviously homework.  But, I think that with explanations you can be set on the right track to thinking out the answers and actually learning something.<br>  <br>  1. You can answer this by listing all the properties of minerals, and all the properties of petroleum.   There is one very key difference between petroleum (and water) from minerals.<br>  <br>  2. Well, what does "natural" mean?  Does it mean that it was made by humans or not made by humans? But for mineral formation, there's another criteria for something to be natural.  Check your notes/book, and you'll see very clearly what it is.<br>  <br>  3. Think about what happens when a crystal forms out of magma. You have a big melt of mixed chemicals.  When it cools to a proper temperature, minerals will begin to crystallize at whatever chemical composition is most stable at that temp.  It continues until the magma become solid or is erupted - then the lava will continue cooling.<br>  But a solution is just a bunch of ions dissolved in water (or other liquid). The temperature doesn't play as much of a role in what can form.  Have you ever been in a chemistry class where you add 2 liquids to either a test tube or a plate, and things will precipitate or they wont?  Well, minerals forming from a solution are formed very similar to that chemistry experiment.  They're formed by bonding, not by cooling.

The Singularity was at one point infinitely dense, and because infinite density is a side effect of light-speed travel, and because light-speed travel results in a freezing of time for the object traveling at light speed, the logical follow-up is that there was no "before" the big bang.  If time is frozen, there is no way to get to a "before."

Case in point is Dextrocardia (heart turned to the right instead of the left) and an appendix on the right instead of the left.  Both are abnormal but everything still works the same.  A disorder is a malfunction in how something works. It can be a disease, a bad valve in the heart or a kidney that doesn't work like it should.  Hope this helps.

RjUWPz5daa	Here are a few:|`|Ny79udz1aa	Hello. You've triggered one of my sore points. Sorry, no articles per se. Maybe a different slant on things. We have had warm and cool times in recent historical times. For eleven tears in the seventeenth century, Scotland was plagued by cold wet seasons and never gathered a harvest. This definitely contributed to the subsequent union with England. In the nineteenth century, London regularly staged "Frost Fairs" on the frozen river Thames. Most of our climate change is caused by fluctuations in the output of the sun. It runs in big, long cycles, and erratic short ones. Algael bloom in the oceans can increase sunlight heat absorption. ( Think the difference between the heat of a white sheet and a black one exposed to sunlight. The most thought-provoking idea that I can give you is this. Researchers, and scientists tend to come to a consensus about the paradigm ( the world view, in other words). But, they live by the grant money they get for research, and the papers and articles that they publish. The former depending to a great extent on the latter. Do you want to be the person who says that the emperor has no clothes, when the result will be a cessation in grant money, to work and live on, and the censure of your peers, who have nailed their colours to the mast of humankind causes. Why? Because they wanted to live and work, and the politicians, directly and indirectly control most sources of funding. Does global warming give politicians another reason to tax us, and appear virtuous? Does recycling, to stop polluting , and generally keeping the environment clean, really equate to global warming? Not poisoning the environment would seem to be good idea. But tying it to global warming as a humanity caused effect? Is it proven? Not yet.|`|A3RU9L1Raa	solar insolation depends on variously; the tilt of the earth's axis and the eccentricity of its orbit. these do change over regular cycles of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years. the 22yr sunspot cycle mediates cosmic ray bombardment. cosmic rays are believed to act as condensation nuclei for cloud formation like a charged particle in a bubble chamber (this has warming/cooling effect).<br>  The oceans are a reservoir for dissolved CO2. If a slight change in isolation or decrease in sunspot activity creates slightly higher atmos temps, more C02 comes out of solution. C02 in the troposphere radiates more heat in2 the atmosphere which in turn liberates more ocean C02..positive feedback loop. Eventually the C02 will be absorbed by the subsequent increase in C3 and C4 type plants and the rate of production of oceanic C02 will reach max..eventually the system comes to equilibrium. This is how the earth's temp prob changed in the historic and geological past.There are actually 2 issues here..<br>  does anthropogenic C02 sig affect/disturb this cycle and destroy the equilibrium at sustainable temps?<br>  In the previous temp/climate excursions going back millenia..would modern technological life with a pop of 6B have been sustainable?<br>  The trouble with the 'debate' is we don't have an accur8 enough math model of the climate 2 discrimin8 between the 'noise' of small random temp changes and the (possible) 'signal' of anthropogenically driven ones.<br>  The 'vested interests' arguments are worthless propaganda.

KJHw0oI3aa	Do you mean with each other?<br>  <br>  If so, oxygen atoms form double bonds with other oxygen atoms by sharing two electrons from each atom.  Each atom can then add two electrons to its own valence shell that already contains six electrons.  Carbon, of course can form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon atoms in order to complete its valence shell that already contains four electrons.  Other than that, Lithium and Beryllium are metals, and they tend to lose rather than share electrons.  Boron has three valence electrons, and being a metalloid, usually shares them with three other nonmetallic atoms in single bonds.  Fluorine has seven valence electrons, and will only share one with another atom to get one in return.  Neon is a noble gas, and not likely to do any sharing since it already has eight valence electrons.|`|efe48b2704958e20b36597e1775c5058aa	Beryllium and Oxygen...Each has a Valence of 2.<br>  As ions..Be(2+) and O(2-).|`|jAjCv4wnaa	I know that carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are commonly seen making double bonds.  I am pretty sure that Boron can do it also.  Fluorine and neon can probably do it too, though it would be incredibly unstable and would not last long.  They can form these double bonds because of their P atomic orbitals that can overlap with other P atomic orbitals.

kFHwzBG7aa	Well, the correct term is false-color images, but it's the same thing.  I don't know how much background you have on light, but essentially light is only a very narrow band of electromagnetic radiation.  Some other things that are also electromagnetic radiation include radio waves, microwaves, heat (infrared), x-rays, and gamma rays (it's funny that sometimes they call them rays and sometimes they call them waves, but they're all the same thing).  The order that I listed them was lowest intensity to highest.  You see, light waves don't have a measurable amplitude like other kinds of waves.  Instead, their instensity is related to their frequency, or wavelength.  Shorter, higher-frequency waves (like x-rays and gamma rays) are more energetic than longer waves like radio waves.<br>  <br>  The light we can see is a narrow band between infrared (heat) and x-ray. (UV light is actually between visible and x-ray).  But stars, nebula, and other Things That Glow (tm) don't just emit Visible electromagnetic radiation, they also emit radiation on many other wavelengths, all the way from radio waves up to high-power x-rays (and sometimes gamma rays).  Since the specific wavelengths these things emit depends on their chemical make up, examining them can tell us much about what we're looking at.  When things glow, the colors they emit usually depend on how hot they are.  Something that glows in infrared is much cooler than something that glows in X-rays.<br>  <br>  Our eyes pick up only red, green, and blue light, and so any mixture of these can appear as any color (eg, red + blue = purple, red + green = yellow)<br>  <br>  To make a false-color image, astronomers will usually take 3 pictures of an object from 3 different telescopes (often infrared, visible, and x-ray).  Each one of these pictures is grayscale, meaning black-and-white, but when they use each one as a component in a color image, they make the false-color image.  For example, a false-color image may have infrared light mapped to red, visible light mapped to green, and x-rays mapped to blue, but how the colors are mapped out is really arbitrary.<br>  <br>  Many of the astounding NASA photos of nebulae and other cool things actually look a lot less interesting if just viewed in visible light.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped!|`|RSbn5STjaa	colors in invisible light images mean different things.  in x-ray images, colors can indicate differing amounts of x-rays.  color in infrared images indicates the amount of heat, generally blue being cooler and red to white being hotter.|`|rvRimbVYaa	In x-rays red colour means very hot purple not so hot and blue cold while gamma rays colours do not show warmness and coldness but quantities and how much it radiates gamma rays|`|ns1F0p8Laa	i really cant say.  do u mean ghostly colors|`|t9iWZmmQaa	X-ray and infrared images are often given false colours to help with interpretation. For example the hottest region of an infrared image will have the shortest wavelength but it is usually colour coded red (a long visible wavelength) and the coldest part of the image will have the longest wavelength but it is usually colour coded blue (a short visible wavelength).
RgSCstkAaa	Thank you for bringing this website to my attention. I have emailed the author, suggesting to him that the likelihood of an aneurysm in the chest being directly caused by a car crash is much the same as the likelihood of a hen having teeth. What happens in a car crash is that the aorta (near the back of the chest) is thrown forwards and torn off the roots of the spinal arteries which hold it in place, at which point you bleed to death. If this does not occur there is no other mechanism to cause a serious disruption of the wall of the aorta which could later result in an aneurysm.<br>  <br>  In any case, the forces on the wall of the arm artery while measuring the blood pressure are tiny by comparison with the forces exerted on the body in a car crash. It is not widely known in the general public that in orthopaedic surgery a cuff, similar to a blood pressure cuff, is routinely inflated above the arterial pressure for over an hour during the surgery.

wbyz32sFaa	Basically, an alternating current is a current that repeatedly reverses its direction. So for example, in one cycle of an AC current, the charge carriers (which would usually be electrons) move one way in a circuit, then reverse direction, then re-reverse direction etc.<br>  <br>  In contrast, DC (direct current) is the unidirectional (in one direction) flow or movement of electric charge carriers (which are usually electrons). The general direction of movement stays the same at all times.|`|G3LpGWXbaa	Alternating current means that the electron flow changes direction over time. <br>  <br>  Technically, direct current can change amplitude but cannot change polarity.<br>  <br>  A common example of AC is the wiring in your home. In the U.S.A. the voltage is constantly changing in sinusoidal fashion. This sine wave is divided such that half of it is positive relative to zero volts and the other is negative. This undulating force pushes electrons back and forth at a cycle of 60 times per second (60Hz). The nominal voltage rating of 120V is the RMS (at kind of average, the peaks of the wave are more like 170V) of this constantly changing voltage. <br>  <br>  An example of DC would be the output of a car battery. This voltage is practically constant and never changing in amplitude or polarity. It is important to note that this is not always the case for DC supplies. A DC voltage can undulate (even dropping to zero) it just can never change polarity.|`|rFse1iiqaa	alternating current goes any way  and direct only goes one way
bXcmhRUOaa	There are many people who have lost trust in the government and feel that the vaccination itself poses a greater risk than the disease. This has caused a backlash against mandatory vaccinations - esp for diseases like HPV which are not contagious. There is also a problem when too many vaccinations are mandated.  When only a few children are not vaccinated they are still generally safe from disease because of "herd" immunity, but the size of the backlash against government mandates has grown.  Creating a new mandate will only exacerbate the problem.  Perhaps it would be best if schools only required the most basic shots, instead of everything available.

stAeoUeSaa	I recommend the new movie coming out soon called THE CROSS instead.<br>  <br>  Winter solstice Dec. 21, 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

AbRfd29Haa	They don't... the modulation scheme isn't related to how far the signal can travel (it can relate to some other things, such as how weak a signal can be at the receiver and still prove useful). <br>  <br>  With broadcast of over-the-air radio, however, it's all about frequencies. Commercial AM radio in the USA is at 520 kHz–1,610 kHz (considered medium-wave, there are other AM radios in the longwave and shortwave ranges), while commercial FM in the USA is between 88MHz and 108MHz (in-between channels 6 and 7 on the VHF television bands). <br>  <br>  There's a formula, called the Friis transmission equation (named for Harald T Friis), which is used to determine the RF power delivered from a transmitter to a receiver. The full equation is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_trans...</a> <br>  <br>  The one I use for simple situations is simpler: <br>  Free space loss (dB) = 32.44 + 20 log f (MHz) + 20 log d (km)<br>  <br>  In short, you lose power as you go away in distance and up in frequency.  So work that out for AM vs. FM at, say, 25km, and you have a loss of 54.71dB for AM radio, but a 99.29dB loss for FM radio. <br>  <br>  That's not the only factor, of course... some other losses are based on other interactions between your frequencies and the environment. AM radio can benefit a bit from groundwave propagation... the waves tend to follow the earth, while FM is considered "line of sight"... at those frequencies, the radio waves aren't bothered too much by buildings or trees, but they are absorbed by the earth, rather than diffracted by it. Longwave radio ( 30kHz-300kHz, not used much in the USA, but used commercially elsewhere) travels even better by groundwave propagation, as there's even less absorption by the earth. <br>  <br>  Rain affects different frequencies.. higher frequencies like satellite and cell phone lose considerably, lower frequencies aren't much affected. Some wavelengths can work "on the skip", bouncing around in the lower atmosphere, if the weather is right... commercial AM radio and the old CB radio are two examples of this. Shortwave is completely refracted by the ionosphere (search "Skywave Propagation" for more info), which allows it to be used for worldwide communications.. the only real option before satellites and undersea cables. <br>  <br>  So in short, AM goes farther because it's at a lower frequency, which permits groundwave propagation, and is less lossy in the air due to the lower frequency as well. And occasionally, you get atmospheric skipping, though that's more common with shortwave. AM is a simpler technology than FM, and uses less radio bandwidth -- smaller channels, which make it superior to use at lower frequencies. But of course, subject to more noise issues.|`|M9JcanLKaa	Some of the wavelengths used for AM transmissions are reflected by layers in the upper atmosphere. Particularly transmissions in the short wave bands can be received a great distances. However, with all this reflecting about the quality does suffer. Wavelengths used for FM transmissions have much higher frequencies and are not reflected. Reception is strictly line of sight. However, because of this direct reception the quality has the potential to be much better and linked with frequency modulation (as opposed to amplitude modulation) the quality of broadcasts is much better.|`|ixOE0onnaa	it do sent have to hold its breath.
2gjfFsYKaa	FM is "frequency modulation" and AM is "amplitude modulation." Both are analog. One can of course send digital information through an analog channel just by using two levels of modulation.

X8LNbaKQaa	Any time light passes from one refractive index to a different refractive index, some part of the light is reflects off the surface where the change takes place.  The soap bubbles have a refractive index very close to that of pure water, and in a foam, there are many layers of tiny bubbles, so there are many reflections and reflections of reflections.  The sum of all those reflections just mix all the reflected light together much like what happens when light bounces off and other white surface.  This also happens with the clear water crystals snow is made of.  The thickness of the liquid in the walls of the bubbles is so thin, that any dye color in the solution that makes up the bubbles hardly makes any difference in the reflects light.  You can add food coloring to soap solution and then make foam with it to see how dark the solution has to be before it tints the light bouncing off (and through) the foam.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_...</a><br>  <a href="http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/rays_txt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://physics-animations.com/Physics/En...</a><br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|CuMYdQV6aa	All the soap bubbles I've seen were transparent with rainbow effects - not white.

k5Ece8BTaa	Any theory which explains the existence of the Moon must naturally explain the following facts:<br>  ? The Moon's low density (3.3 g/cc) shows that it does not have a substantial iron core like the Earth does. <br>  ? Moon rocks contain few volatile substances (e.g. water), which implies extra baking of the lunar surface relative to that of Earth. <br>  ? The relative abundance of oxygen isotopes on Earth and on the Moon are identical, which suggests that the Earth and Moon formed at the same distance from the Sun. <br>  <br>  Various theories had been proposed for the formation of the Moon. Below these theories are listed along with the reasons they have since been discounted. <br>  <br>  ? The Fission Theory: This theory proposes that the Moon was once part of the Earth and somehow separated from the Earth early in the history of the solar system. The present Pacific Ocean basin is the most popular site for the part of the Earth from which the Moon came. This theory was thought possible since the Moon's composition resembles that of the Earth's mantle and a rapidly spinning Earth could have cast off the Moon from its outer layers. However, the present-day Earth-Moon system should contain "fossil evidence" of this rapid spin and it does not. Also, this hypothesis does not have a natural explanation for the extra baking the lunar material has received. <br>  ? The Capture Theory: This theory proposes that the Moon was formed somewhere else in the solar system, and was later captured by the gravitational field of the Earth. The Moon's different chemical composition could be explained if it formed elsewhere in the solar system, however, capture into the Moon's present orbit is very improbable. Something would have to slow it down by just the right amount at just the right time, and scientists are reluctant to believe in such "fine tuning". Also, this hypothesis does not have a natural explanation for the extra baking the lunar material has received.<br>  ? The Condensation Theory: This theory proposes that the Moon and the Earth condensed individually from the nebula that formed the solar system, with the Moon formed in orbit around the Earth. However, if the Moon formed in the vicinity of the Earth it should have nearly the same composition. Specifically, it should possess a significant iron core, and it does not. Also, this hypothesis does not have a natural explanation for the extra baking the lunar material has received. <br>  <br>  There is one theory which remains to be discussed, and it is widely accepted today.<br>  <br>  The Giant Impactor Theory (sometimes called The Ejected Ring Theory): This theory proposes that a planetesimal (or small planet) the size of Mars struck the Earth just after the formation of the solar system, ejecting large volumes of heated material from the outer layers of both objects. A disk of orbiting material was formed, and this matter eventually stuck together to form the Moon in orbit around the Earth. This theory can explain why the Moon is made mostly of rock and how the rock was excessively heated. Furthermore, we see evidence in many places in the solar system that such collisions were common late in the formative stages of the solar system. This theory is discussed further below. <br>  <br>  More About The Giant Impactor Theory<br>  In the mid-1970s, scientists proposed the giant impact scenario for the formation of the Moon. The idea was that an off-center impact of a roughly Mars-sized body with a young Earth could provide Earth with its fast initial spin, and eject enough debris into orbit to form the Moon. If the ejected material came primarily from the mantles of the Earth and the impactor, the lack of a sizeable lunar core was easily understood, and the energy of the impact could account for the extra heating of lunar material required by analysis of lunar rock samples obtained by the Apollo astronauts. <br>  <br>  For nearly a decade, the giant impact theory was not believed by most scientists. However, in 1984, a conference devoted to lunar origin prompted a critical comparison of the existing theories. The giant impact theory emerged from this conference with nearly consensus support by scientists, enhanced by new models of planet formation that suggested large impacts were actually quite common events in the late stages of terrestrial planet formation. <br>  <br>  The basic idea is this: about 4.45 billion years ago, a young planet Earth -- a mere 50 million years old at the time and not the solid object we know today-- experienced the largest impact event of its history. Another planetary body with roughly the mass of Mars had formed nearby with an orbit that placed it on a collision course with Earth. When young Earth and this rogue body collided, the energy involved was 100 million times larger than the much later event believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs. The early giant collision destroyed the rogue body, likely vaporized the upper layers of Earth's mantle, and ejected large amounts of debris into Earth orbit. Our Moon formed from this debris.|`|2gjfFsYKaa	The prevailing explanation is described at the reference.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	One theory is that 5 billion years ago, a huge piece of rock smashed into earth.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Shield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a warrior's shield. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures (rift zones) that develop on the flanks of the cone. Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes. In northern California and Oregon, many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii-- two of the world's most active volcanoes. The floor of the ocean is more than 15,000 feet deep at the bases of the islands. As Mauna Loa, the largest of the shield volcanoes (and also the world's largest active volcano), projects 13,677 feet above sea level, its top is over 28,000 feet above the deep ocean floor.|`|1Qy3hqUUaa	You had mentioned that you know about viscosity and such, but I will throw it in just in case.

vYAgIMLdaa	Yes, they enrich the soil which is necessary for the growth of any plants.<br>  Benefits of Earthworms<br>  <br>  Deep burrowing species such as L. terrestris can burrow through compacted soil and penetrate plough pans, creating channels for drainage, aeration, and root growth (Joschko et al., 1989). Recent work by Shipitalo and Protz (1989) elucidated some of the mechanisms by which earthworms enhance soil aggregation. Ingested aggregates are broken up in a liquid slurry that mixes soil with organic material and binding agents. The defecated casts become stable after drying. Stewart et al. (1988) also presented evidence that earthworms initiate the formation of stable soil aggregates in land degraded by mining.<br>  <br>  In forest ecosystems earthworms, especially litter feeders such as L. terrestris, can consume all the litter deposited on the soil surface within a period of several weeks (Knollenberg et al., 1985) or months (Satchell, 1967). Incorporation of litter by earthworms in apple orchards can be an important mechanism for preventing outbreaks of scab fungus, spores of which are transmitted from litter to new foliage by spring rains. Raw (1962) found a high correlation between L. terrestris biomass and apple leaf litter incorporation, with over 90 percent of litter incorporated during the winter when this species was abundant. Incorporation of surface litter may be an important function of earthworms in no-tillage agroecosystems.<br>  <br>  Introduction of earthworms to areas not previously populated has led to improvement of soil quality and productivity in New Zealand grassland (Martin, 1977), on drained Dutch polders (Van Rhee, 1977), in heathland in Ireland (Curry and Bolger 1984), and in mining spoils in the U.S. (Vimmerstedt and Finney, 1973).<br>  <br>  Earthworm casts are sources of nutrients for plants. Lumbricids in a pasture soil produced casts that contained 73 percent of the nitrogen found in the ingested litter; indicating both the importance of earthworms in incorporating litter nitrogen into the soil and the inefficiency of nitrogen digestion by earthworms (Syers et al., 1979). Earthworms increase the amount of nitrogen mineralized from organic matter in soil. Because nitrification is enhanced in earthworm casts, the ratio of nitrate-N to ammonium-N tends to increase when earthworms are present (Ruz Jerez et al., 1988). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are found in the gut of earthworms and in earthworm casts, and higher nitrogenase activity, meaning greater rates of N-fixation, are found in casts when compared with soil (Simek and Pizl, 1989).<br>  <br>  Earthworms may increase levels of metabolic activity in soils, as measured by the amount of CO2 evolved, yet nematode abundance and microbial biomass may decrease (Yeates, 1981; Ruz Jerez et al., 1988). This occurs because earthworms reduce the amount of substrate available to other decomposers, and because earthworms ingest other decomposer organisms as they feed. This process would tend to accelerate nutrient cycling rates.|`|b30ebd51a705432ff85d083b2d05aea7aa	You can see for yourself. Buy an earthworm-composting set-up..about 3-4 black plastic trays with a top lid,add your 'clean' uncomposted matter...no meat scraps etc,weeds with seeds etc and add some worms. As each layer developes,deposit it to the next tray down..and so forth.Before you know it...you will have a liquid fertiliser..there will be a tap at the bottom..with which you will have to dilute with water..very good stuff.Even better if you live in an apartment if you so wish...egg shells,especially coffee grounds which you can just put around the surface of any plants.But,THE result is that earthworms make soil friable..keep them happy and pH neutral (just in the acidic range) and you might not have to buy gypsum and other 'clay-breakers'. As castings they are also high in nutrients and important chemical ratios eg Carbon/Nitrogen.Feed them plenty of organic matter..the structure and fertility of the soil are the basis for growth..all over...roots,stems,leaves and flowers..depending upon your crop of course.|`|7VXhmWbPaa	wow, the guy above me really knows his stuff. Yeah earthworms enrich the soil because of the nutrients found in their feces. This is becuase they eat mainly plant matter, and this decomposes and acts as a fertilizer for the plants.

And removing an entire species all together would be a hard task because the tiniest remnants of the coral will allow it to grow.  In a way, man kind is already removing all of the corals by polluting the waters they live in.  The lost already is irreversible and to think of all the medicine we could have gathered from some of the now extinct corals is a huge lost to the medical community. <br>  <br>  If ALL of the corals were to be removed, we would lose a lot of species of fish that rely on the corals as their homes.  This would cause a huge disruption in the food chain because other fishes eat the fish from the reef and if they're no longer there.. they would starve and other fish that eat them would also suffer.. this would go all the way up the food chain.  I hope that scenario never happens.

Your friend is better off buying his own telescope and trying to find it with that.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Nope, sorry.  First, they didn't have the right to sell stars in the first place - it's just a scam.  Second, they 'sold' all the bright ones a long time ago, so many of the ones they're 'selling' now you'd need Hubble to see.  Third, they often 'sell' stars that don't even exist - when I ran our college observatory, someone came to me with the same request - except 'her' star didn't exist.  Fourth, professional observatories require astronomers to submit proposals for time on the telescope months, even years in advance - this isn't a good use of telescope time.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to try to find it here.

Most professional observatories won't allow the general public to even look through their telescopes. Such scopes are almost never used visually, only for imaging, and may not even have an eyepiece to look through! You might do better at an astronomy club museum or a star party.<br>  <br>  Though when I was visiting Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff AZ I saw an observatory employee go out of his way to help someone with exactly this request.<br>  <br>  Whenever I've tried locating one of these stars myself, I've found them to be very faint, right at the limiting magnitude of large amateur scopes. They would be challenging even for an experienced amateur astronomer to locate, so don't buy a  telescope and expect to find the star yourself.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Unfortunately, groups that sell star names don't have any relationship with the IAU which is the official international governing body for naming all objects in space.<br>  <br>  However, don't despair, there is hope.

You don't even have to go to an observatory.

AA11489856	The molecular mass of CO is: <br>  12 amu (from the carbon atom) + 16 amu (from the oxygen atom) = 28 amu.<br>  <br>  Since you have 9.00*10^20 molecules and you know that 1 mole = 6.02*10^23 molecules (avogadro's number) then the number of moles of CO = 9.00*10^20/6.02*10^23 = 5.40*10^-2 moles.<br>  <br>  Now you have the moles of the substance and its molar mass you can calculate its mass in grams: Note that amu is the same as g/mol meaning that 28 g of CO = 1 mole of CO so how many grams would 1.50*10^-3 moles be equal to? The answer is 28 x 5.40*10^-2= 1.51 grams.<br>  <br>  The density of CO is 0.967g/L<br>  Volume = Mass/density<br>  Volume of CO = 1.51/0.967= 1.56 L<br>  <br>  So for CO Gram formula mass= 28 amu; the number of moles=  5.40*10^-2 moles; the mass in gram= 1.51 grams; Volume = 1.56 Liters.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now for Ar:<br>  You can get the Gram formula mass of Ar right from the periodic table. Ar = 40 amu.<br>  <br>  Number of moles = 1.8*10^22/6.02*10^23= 3*10^-2 moles.                                                                                                     <br>  The mass in grams = 40 x 3*10^-2 =  1.2 grams.<br>  <br>  The density of Ar is 1.784g/L from that you can calcualte the volume.<br>  Volume = mass/density.<br>  <br>  Volume of Ar= 1.2/1.784= 0.673 L<br>  <br>  So for Ar: Gram formula mass = 40 amu; Number of moles = 3*10^-2 moles; Mass in grams = 1.2 grams, Volume = 0.673 Liters.

YUcl70rbaa	Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from Ionia to Athens. His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of meteorites led him to form new theories of the universal order. He attempted to give a scientific account of eclipses, meteors, rainbows, and the sun, which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the Peloponnese. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. However, these theories brought him into collision with the popular faith; Anaxagoras' views on such things as heavenly bodies were considered "dangerous."<br>  <br>  <br>  Of importance to the philosophical concept of atomism is the historical accident that the particles that chemists and physicists of the early 19th century thought were indivisible, and therefore identified with the uncuttable a-toms of long tradition, were found in the 20th century to be composed of even smaller entities: electrons, neutrons, and protons. Further experiments showed that protons and neutrons are made of even more fundamental quarks. These particles at present show no experimental evidence of size or substructure. However, the trend of empirical evidence for ever-smaller subatomic particles raises the question: "Is matter infinitely divisible?" Since absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence, experiment cannot answer this question.

YHNK9UrQaa	It sounds like you’ve been doing some experiments with foods.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  1. What materials tested positive for peptide bonds, by using the Biuret test?  <br>  <br>  Biuret reaction is a chemical test used to test for the presence of peptide bonds and/or protein.  Biuret reagent changes colour, and a violet color indicates the presence of proteins.<br>  <br>  I don’t know which foods you used for the test, but I would guess that the materials that tested positive would have been something rich in protein such as meat or peanut-butter.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  2.What was the negative control for all of these tests, Benedict's test and Biuret test?<br>  <br>  In everyday life, when something happens, it is usually difficult to say EXACTLY why that something happened. For example, if your house plant dies, you might think it died because you forgot to water it, or maybe it died because it didn’t get enough light, or maybe it died because it had the wrong soil, or maybe it died because your friend spilled hot tea into the soil when you weren’t looking. Usually, in everyday life, you can’t always be completely sure exactly why something happened because there are too many things that might be the cause. There are too many "VARIABLES" that might have been the cause.<br>  <br>  In science, most experiments are “CONTROLLED”.  Scientists usually put a “CONTROL” into their experiments to “CONTROL” the “VARIABLES”, so they can be more certain why a particular result happened.<br>  <br>  Usually, a “CONTROL” involves setting up another almost identical experiment where the only difference between the two experiments is the one “VARIABLE” that you are testing. That way, if you get a result in one experiment, but not in the otherwise identical “CONTROL” experiment, you can say that the result was caused by the “VARIABLE” that you were testing, and not by some other incidental “VARIABLE”.<br>  <br>  So ... in your experiment, when you used the Benedict's reagent to test for sugar, you probably used one test tube which contained Benedict's reagent and the food sample that you were testing, AND you used another test tube which contained Benedict's reagent and NO food sample.  The second test tube which contained Benedict's reagent and NO food sample was your negative “CONTROL” experiment for the sugar test.  The test tube containing NO food sample showed you what colour the Benedict's reagent turned when there was no sugar present.  You compare the colours in the two test tubes to draw a conclusion about the presence of sugar in the food sample.<br>  <br>  Similarly ... in your experiment, when you used the Biuret reagent to test for protein, you probably used one test tube which contained Biuret reagent and the food sample that you were testing, AND you used another test tube which contained Biuret reagent and NO food sample.  The second test tube which contained Biuret reagent and NO food sample was your negative “CONTROL” experiment for the protein test.

UXf6g6Sjaa	No, don't give up. Your problem is not a lack of work experience.<br>  <br>  Your problem is in not knowing how to write a resume and how to apply for a job.<br>  <br>  The standard book for this is "What Color Is Your Parachute?". Get a copy, read it, and apply the principles therein. Maybe go to a job hunting class if you are not good at book learning.<br>  <br>  The best way to get a job in my experience is to go to an Aerospace Engineering conference, and network with engineers during the breaks. Set up job interviews with them, and bring your resume with you to the interview. Obviously it should be customized for the job to which you are applying.<br>  <br>  But the other techniques mentioned in the book also work - it is just an issue of personal style. But I would forget whatever you have been doing for the last 5 years!<br>  <br>  GOLDEN RULE:-<br>  Never, never, ever, ever contact HR until AFTER you have been offered the job by the project engineer. Then fill in the required forms and you are done. Any contact with HR before this is fatal. Reading between the lines, this is probably why you have not had a job offer in 5 years.<br>  <br>  Changing fields will not help, the same job seeking considerations will still apply.

klpNrhhAaa	Mars is not very geologically active now, but at one point it had an active core that generated volcanism and a magnetic field.  The consensus seems to be that the magnetic field would have protected an atmosphere at a temperature that allowed liquid water.<br>  <br>  Volcanism would have facilitated the formation of quartz.  It has been detected:  "An analysis of data from the roving vehicle called Sojourner revealed that a small dark Martian rock named Barnacle Bill consists of approximately equal parts of quartz; feldspar, a common terrestrial crustal mineral, and orthopyroxene, an igneous mineral formed under extreme heat."<br>  From:   Mars History: Heat and Cold Leave Marks, JOHN NOBLE WILFORD, July 9, 1997, in the New York Times.  I'll put a link below ... looks like an interesting story.<br>  <br>  The liquid water would have facilitated the possible formation of larger quartz crystals in underground cavities - much as happens here on Earth.  And so there probably are quartz 'gems' on Mars.<br>  <br>  They might well be rare, however, because quartz was not detected by an orbiting spectrometer:  "Potassium feldspar, low-Ca pyroxene, basaltic glass, olivine, sulfate, carbonate, quartz, and amphibole are not detected with confidence at 1 pixel/degree"<br>  (Click on the citation at the third link to get a .pdf)<br>  <br>  BTW:  the NY Times story notes that Mars resembles the Earth more than the moon does, and that the geology is complex ... so keep up the interest!|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Most sand is silica, which means there is quartz on Mars, but maybe not crystalline quartz.<br>  <br>  "...The analyzed rocks were partially covered by dust but otherwise compositionally similar to each other.

ejodXS5naa	No.  You can't.  The reason is rather simple.  Imagine a computer that can modle everything.  Well, that computer is part of "everything".  So it needs to model itself.  For a computer to model another computer, it needs to be as complicated as the computer it is modeling.  But if a computer is modeling the entire universe plus itself, then it needs to be as complicated as itself PLUS the entire universe.  But a computer can not be more complicated than it is.  So there is a logical contradiction.  Which makes it impossible.  Unless the computer is in a different universe and is modeling our more simple universe.  <br>  <br>  OR, more simply, you can think of the universe as a computer, which models itself.<br>  <br>  Those are the only ways you could have a computer that can model our entire universe.|`|2b72b9528798e570987fa62222e76e27aa	1.

R0Ogy5qlaa	Do you have to use vectors?<br>  <br>  The old-fashioned definition of curvature is kappa = d(theta)/ds, where s is arc length and theta = arctan(dy/dx).  A little manipulation leads to the formula<br>  <br>  kappa = (d^2y/dx^2)/(1 + (dy/dx)^2)^(3/2).<br>  <br>  So let's try that.  <br>  <br>  dy/dx = 3 - 9/x^2<br>  <br>  (dy/dx)^2 = (3 - 9/x^2)^2 = 9 - 54/x^2 + 81/x^4<br>  <br>  1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 10 - 54/x^2 + 81/x^4<br>  <br>  Also d^2y/dx^2 = 18/x^3.

B5cuNTxQaa	The Earth's atmosphere doesn't really stop at a certain place and then "space" begins. The air gets thinner as you go up from the surface and the farther from Earth you get the thinner it is. It gets thinner still if you leave our solar system and even thinner in intergalactic space. But it is always there.<br>  <br>  In reality, no volume of space can ever be perfectly empty. A perfect vacuum with a gaseous pressure of absolute zero is a philosophical concept that does not exist in nature.<br>  <br>  The exosphere is the last atmospheric layer before space. Since there is no clear boundary with space and the exosphere, the exosphere is sometimes used synonymously with outer space.<br>  <br>  A level of Earth's atmosphere called the exobase ranges from about 250 to 500 kilometres (160 to 310 mi) depending on solar activity. The exobase is the lowest altitude of the exosphere, and is formally defined in one of two ways:<br>  <br>     1. The height above which there are the negligible atomic collisions between the particles and<br>     2. The height above which constituent atoms are on purely ballistic trajectories.<br>  <br>  The fluctuation in the height of the exobase is important because the atmosphere below this level provides significant atmospheric drag on satellites, eventually causing them to fall from orbit if no action is taken to maintain the orbit.<br>  .

mRG0W5Yxaa	There's always stuff around, but right now it's not easy to turn up too much.  Your best bet is to do what insectivores do - turn over rocks and logs, pry off loose bark, do sweep netting in old weedy fields (well, insectivores don't usually do that, but it's surprisingly effective, even in the winter), and you can try making a simple pit trap for crawlers if you have time to wait for the weather to get a bit warmer - bury a can so that the lip of the can is just at the top of the ground, and then prop some sort of cover, like a rock or something heavy so that there's some clearance above the can.  This way, things that crawl on the ground have a good chance of falling in and not being able to get out.  You'd want to check it every day, obviously.  This is more effective when it's warm and lots of things are wandering around, but there might be some activity in open fields on sunny days even in March.<br>  Good luck!
dl8SRMngaa	Aerobic respiration can produce a maximum of 38 ATP per glucose molecule.  Anaerobic respiration can produce 2 ATP per glucose molecule.  As a result, aerobic respiration is about 19 times more efficient.  Therefore, you would need 19 times less glucose if respiring aerobically:  1,000 g of glucose divided by 19 equals around 50 g of glucose required if respiration is aerobic.

YYLybWHSaa	Phytochrome switches between forms depending on the type of light it was last exposed to. Red light makes it shift shape to the phytochrome 'fr' form. Far red light reverses the protein to the 'r' shape.<br>  <br>  Far-red light can penetrate more easily through foliage, so if a plant is growing in shade, it will receive more far-red light and the phytochrome will be switched or reversed by receiving more red light. <br>  <br>  Lacking phytochrome should make the shade grown mutant plant less sensitive. This is because the protein wont be present to be in the 'r' form that makes the plant more sensitive.

AA10929714	First, solve the homogeneous problem:<br>  <br>  y'' + 4y' + 8y = 0<br>  <br>  As usual for a linear equation with constant coefficients, seek a solution of the form:  y = exp(k*x)<br>  <br>  This leads to the characteristic equation:<br>  <br>  k^2 + 4k + 8 = 0<br>  <br>  k = -2 + 2i and k = -2 - 2i<br>  <br>  Using Euler's relationship, the homogeneous solution can be written as:<br>  <br>  y_h(x) = exp(-2x) * [A*sin(2x) + B*cos(2x)]<br>  <br>  where A and B are the constants of integration.<br>  <br>  Now use the method of undetermined coefficients to find the particular solution.  We seek a solution of the form:<br>  <br>  y_p = a*exp(-2x) + b*x*exp(-2x)<br>  <br>  y'_p = (b - 2a)*exp(-2x) - 2*b*x*exp(-2x)<br>  <br>  y''_p = (4a - 4b)*exp(-2x) + 4*b*x*exp(-2x)<br>  <br>  Plug these into the original differential equation and solve for the undetermined coefficients a and b.  After dividing through by exp(-2x), this results in:<br>  <br>  (4a - 4b) + 4bx + 4*(b - 2a) - 8bx + 8a +8bx = x<br>  <br>  This simplifies to:<br>  <br>  4a + 4bx = x<br>  <br>  Equating coefficients of like powers in x gives:<br>  <br>  a = 0<br>  <br>  b = 1/4<br>  <br>  The particular solution is:<br>  <br>  y_p(x) = (x/4)*exp(-2x)<br>  <br>  The complete solution is then:<br>  <br>  y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = exp(-2x) * [A*sin(2x) + B*cos(2x) + x/4]

1da3bf2575e7b0729442de82450266caaa	It all starts with a cloud of gas.<br>  <br>  Due to gravity the clouds will start to shrink and in general break up . In the core of each fragment the density and temperature will become high enough so that nuclear fusion can start. Hydrogen will be converted into Helium. The "burning" of Hydrogen produce a counter pressure to gravity that will stop the gas cloud from further shrinking. The gas cloud becomes a stable star. This is the present state of our Sun.<br>  <br>  Rougly 99% of the mass of the cloud ends up in the star. What's left over contracts to a disk and history starts again. Planetoids form and clean up space around them.<br>  <br>  The general idea is that it is warmer closer to the Sun and colder as you go further out. This means that in the inner solar system molecules like water, ammonia and methane tend to stay as gases and not produce grains and clumps and so on. And because they stay in gas form the radiation pressure from the Sun and the solar wind will push them outwards.<br>  <br>  Around the orbit of Jupiter is becomes cold enough for ice to form. The gaseous molecules can produce grains and lumps so there's a lot of this less dense material around to accrete into planets. Jupiter and Saturn grew large enough to pull in great quantities of hydrogen and helium from the solar nebula. <br>  <br>  The inner planets accreted from grains containing heavier atoms like oxygen and aluminium and silicon as well as iron and nickel and so on. <br>  <br>  Consequently inside the ice limit at 5 AU only small, dense planets can form, while outside there is matter enough to form the gas giants.

b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	There are too many unknown variables to give an accurate answer to your questions. Just because a windmill generator can produce 50v at some level of wind speed doesn't mean it can produce 25 watts of electrical power, which is the minimum you need to operate a lightbulb with a 50v filament... and good luck trying to find one of those!<br>  <br>  But, let's just suppose the windmill can produce a half ampere of current with a terminal voltage of fifty volts: that's 25 watts, so it will be enough to power a 25watt lightbulb that operates from 50v. In other words, it would work.<br>  <br>  As to which windmill turbine will power the most electricity, that depends on a whole bunch of other factors like minimum, maximum and average wind speed, area swept by the windmill blades, number of blades, pitch and rate of rotation of the blades, just to name a few of the things you need to consider. There is no one windmill design or windmill turbine that is suitable for all purposes and all locations.<br>  <br>  Do some real research (crack a few books at the library, look at some real windmills on the Internet, ask a lot of questions after you find out what questions to ask) before you even think about a science project.

This isn't the first time they've smashed particles together of course this "Deus ex machina" is a whole new ball game; however, the power needed to produce a black hole that could so much as swallow a a shirt button is insane and way beyond our capabilities.  If we were to set off all of our nuclear weapons at one time, we still wouldn't be able to produce any kind of black hole, not at least that were noticeable or last more than a few femtoseconds.|`|W2suykEtaa	no|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	To answer the first question: <br>  <br>  "Will the Hadron Collider make a Black Hole?"<br>  <br>  The chance for this event is about 1:50, that it can produce microscopic black holes. Such Black holes exist only for a very short instance of time, and couldn't even leave the LHC before they would evaporated.<br>  <br>  To answer the second question:<br>  "Will the Hadron Collider make a Black Hole that will engulf the Earth?"<br>  <br>  Never. Cosmic rays have much more energy when they hit Earth, and from the 100,000 in the last 15 years, which had more energy than the LHC when they hit one of the small detector surfaces, none was producing a lasting black hole. The record cosmic ray, ever measured, had 20 million times more energy as the LHC. Cosmic rays use exactly the same particles as the LHC uses. You can say the LHC produces artificial cosmic rays.<br>  <br>  If neither Earth, nor any other planet in the solar system was ever engulfed by a black hole in 5 billion years of history and strong cosmic rays, it looks like there is a mechanism which prevents this fate.|`|WPPIaLORaa	No.  Here is the reason why.  Even if the LHC smashed two protons together to have the density of a black hole, the total gravitational attraction is still only that of two protons, that is, not much.

f1beDbKIaa	It's based on area.  If 2 m is the diameter of a circle, then the area is 2 * pi * r^2, where r is the radius.  Since the radius is 1/2 the diameter, the area is:<br>  <br>  a = 2 * pi * (1/2 d)^2 = 2 * pi * 1/4 d^2 = 1/2 * pi * d^2<br>  <br>  You can use this formula to compute the ratio of the areas of two scopes.  And when you do that, you find that all the constants cancel, and it's just a ratio of the squares of the diameter.  So, you find the ratio of 10^2 / 2^2 or 20^2 / 2^2.  Pretty easy stuff.
b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	This equation is really v(t) = 2 + 3 cos (whatever) V. It doesn't matter what the (whatever) term is because cos (whatever) varies between +1 and -1 and produces NO DC component. Therefore the DC value of v(t) is exactly 2. The RMS value of v(t) is the sum of the DC value and the RMS value of 3 cos (whatever). The RMS value of any sine or co-sine waveform is the peak value divided by the square root of two. In this case the peak value is 3, so the RMS value is about (3)*(0.707) = 2.12, which you then add to 2 to get the RMS value of v(t) = 4.12 V (about).

4RJKl1aKaa	It would cause more problems that it would solve.  A shuttle can't carry much cargo compared to amount of stuff we landfill, so we would need a lot of shuttle missions.  Those would use a lot of fuel and cause a lot of pollution to say nothing of the economic considerations.  Because of the pollution, it would ultimately be worse for the environment than simply landfilling it.<br>  <br>  As for the Sun, it would not be affected in the slightest.|`|8QKwz7W7aa	It's not feasible. You have to make a special container for the garbages, you have to create special shuttle to carry all the garbage (a big one), and you have to make the shuttle to go closer to the sun or either use the gravitational loop to leap the garbage into the sun(took special research). Mistakes and failures is expensive, and the project is all risky. Recyclable garbage can very extremely dangerous and corrosive such as radioactive material.

It would actually be cheaper to send it into interstellar space or drop it into Jupiter.  It's not the distance, it's the energy.<br>  <br>  But today's garbage piles are the goldmines of tomorrow.  It's likely that recycling and resource extraction from garbage will get better and more economical as time goes on.  So today's garbage should just be stored for use tomorrow.|`|f1beDbKIaa	Great idea.<br>  <br>  However, there is no non-recyclable garbage.  At least compared with the cost of launching things into space.  Currently, that's about $10,000 per pound.  But even if it were 100 times cheaper, that's still $100 per pound.  And for that, you can turn just about anything into something of value.<br>  <br>  Let's take an extreme example.  Nuclear waste.  At the moment, we're talking about storing nuclear waste in a $10 billion facility in a mountain.  The stuff is radioactive, and will remain so for at least a million years.  So the facility has to withstand that amount of time.  However, if it's radioactive, that means that there's more energy in it that can be extracted.  And, the nuclear plants have been designed and tested to do exactly that.  However, we don't use them in the United States because the next waste product can easily be made into weapons grade material.  We don't like having stuff that can be made into atomic bombs easily available.  But, as the easy energy sources become scarce, we'll likely change our minds.  And in the end, we probably won't have radioactive material to store for so long a time.<br>  <br>  The Shuttle, due to retire next year (2010), is not currently capable of leaving low Earth orbit.  So, you'd need to put your stuff in a rocket, either launched with the Shuttle, or launched from the ground.  The Shuttle is being retired for two reasons.  First, it's old.  Second, it's the most expensive and least reliable launch vehicle anyone has used anywhere to put people in space.  It has a 2% launch failure rate.  So using some sort of unmanned rocket would be cheaper and more reliable.<br>  <br>  Actually dropping stuff into the Sun would have no long term effects.
