0d8305e8778349d022800dba9fa06f7caa	Well there are a few differnt reasons it can happen. Infection of the hair folicles, Irritation , and ingrown hairs.<br>  <br>  The best way to shave is to shave with a new or sharp razor and shaving cream for sensative skin, shave in one direction to limit the irritation, and do not apply alot of pressure. After you get done clean off with water, and let it air dry. Drying it with a towel will only irritate your skin, and possibly clog your pores. After it dries use rubbing alcohol a couple of times a day until the irritation goes down.<br>  <br>  And yes it will itch but the Alcohol helps, and if you continue to shave that will go away as well.|`|AA10919107	nair// hair removal cream will leave you smooth and free from pain or marks, ive done my whole body as i swim too and its great to use all over !!|`|AA12197259	The first time around it is recommended that you use an electric razor, or hair clippers to trim hair down to 1/8 of an inch.  Then if you select razor method make sure you go with the direction of the air growth. Going the opposite does make seem to work better but actually may cause the red bumps and risk of in grown hair.  Nair for men is now available in local national drug stores, in roll on, foam or cream.  It stinks but it does work, however tougher hair takes longer so you have to time it.  Australian Nads is a wax that works as well but hurts like a son of b****.|`|45ceb6ddc5c195334a89af74ffd457ebaa	Errrrr..... just stick with the normal shaver.Red bumps (aka shaving bumps)are extremely common for people who shave their chests.

Being a muscle using it will make it stronger not necessarily bigger.  It's a muscle different than the muscles in your arms/legs, it has other functions that run along the inside of it.

Some people get depressed because they have something to be sad about like the death of a close friend or family member. Other people get depressed due to a chemical imbalance in their brain which can cause them to be deeply depressed over what looks like minor events to people with an average brain chemistry makeup.<br>  <br>  Whatever the cause, depression is extremely common and very easy to treat. Like anxiety, it is the common cold of mental illness with a very high rate of success in treatment either through counseling or medication.|`|AA11963715	I agree, when someone is depressed-we give the a pill and tell them they are chemically inbalanced.  Instead looking for the source.  Myabe the person had a bad childhood, maybe the person just needs to vent it out.  We think a pill will make our problems go away-but then you deal with addiction.|`|a23489f25b5d2fca771feb58e7da0bb5aa	Yes, lost self-confidence is almost certainly one reason many people are depressed.  The problem you mentioned (people not thinking for themselves) is HUGE, in my opinion.  Examples:<br>  <br>  Young people join gangs to be a part of something bigger than themselves, and even commit atrocious acts to avoid the judgement of their peers.  They feel insignificant as individuals.  It's the majority opinion that dictates actions and even beliefs.  Gangs are only one small example, in fact, of this behavior.<br>  <br>  Drivers on the highway travel in clumps because they're controlled by other drivers, not guided by their own needs.  The majority of drivers seem obsessed with going as fast as possible ALL the time, and being as close to the person in front of them as possible -- wouldn't want anyone behind them to accuse them of holding up traffic!, even if they're going 65mph.... wouldn't dream of setting the cruise control at a speed *they're* happy with, relaxing for ten damn minutes and staying in the "slow" lane.<br>  <br>  School children are famously cliquish and often judgemental and cruel to outsiders -- new people, or those who don't share the interests or traits which bond the others .  Though it's not all a bad thing, a large motivator is having no confidence in their own opinions, and the risk of being alienated--even attacked--themselves if they don't join the cruelty.<br>  <br>  People here on Yahoo! Answers post questions asking not opinions but for hard facts they could more reliably, and sometimes even more easily, find by doing their own research, online or otherwise.<br>  <br>  Audience members watching a performance they liked will sometimes wait til they hear a few other people applauding before they dare express their own feeling.  Don't wanna be first!<br>  <br>  Too many politicians seem interested not in doing what is right, but in doing what will get them re-elected.  That isn't to say they shouldn't represent the masses--they should--but there are those who will not use their own heads.<br>  <br>  A person in a conversational group -- when one of the others (or a passerby) has made a comment that took him/her by surprise or sounded ridiculous or brilliant (but unusual) -- will tend to look at each of the others' facial reactions, before daring to reveal their own approval or disapproval.  Can't think outside the box.<br>  <br>  A more egregious example of the above: a pathetic approval-seeker who follows a stronger leader and makes rude or childish comments about a third party just to get the approval of the strong leader.  You often see him/her laughing at their own jokes and looking intently at the stronger one after delivering the verbal punch, desperately hoping for approval at the expense of the victim.<br>  <br>  People doing wrong things because others do.  If ten million people acquire free and illegal mp3's to avoid paying anything (and stiffing the artist and producers who made it available for you, in the process), it must be ok!<br>  <br>  People doing right things not *because* they're right, but because the Bible tells them so, or the consequence of doing wrong may be going to hell.  This isn't an attack on religion or faith, but on lack of inner guidance and confidence.<br>  <br>  "Does this make me look fat?"  What do *you* think?<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong.  I've been in some of these shoes before; that's why I'm familiar with the scenarios.  I, too, have gone through periods of lack of confidence, as most people probably have.  <br>  <br>  It's possible that even your own question, dear asker -- and I'm not knocking you for this!, just extending my point -- may show some lingering lack of confidence in your beliefs, though it may also be merely a matter of curiosity.  Either way, it's understandable; I've been there many times (wondering what others think of my opinions).  Perhaps that's one reason I'm drawn to Yahoo! Answers!<br>  <br>  Your statement, "no one really knows what's right cosmically or relating to you, for you" is right on target, in so many cases.  So many beliefs people have are *matters of opinion* and sadly, they just don't get that.  Much of what I'm saying *here* is a matter of opinion -- but I do get it.  And you seem to get it that your opinion comes first.<br>  <br>  I probably went a little far afield of the point of your question, but I hope you'll also find what you were seeking in there somewhere!  :-)  <br>  <br>  I can't speak knowledgeably about the drug issue, but I wouldn't doubt for a second that drugs are over-prescribed and the root of the individual's problem is ignored!<br>  <br>  I don't know if I'd say we've *lost* the ability to think for ourselves.  I can't speak about trends over the years, decades or centuries.  But I certainly do think it's a serious problem which affects every one of us, both from the inside and out.|`|c4a0b566c849de3a4f513e29e103bb01aa	I agree in so many ways.  I also believe that people take themselves way too seriously.  People should learn to trust themselves.

AA12241722	Poor guys... I feel so sorry for them...<br>  <br>  Just WHY in the world would most people get that idea into the Guys' heads that this-or-that is wrong... almost like saying that if you don't fall into this category you're not normal and worst of all broken. Advertisements are NOT helping either in no way and no how. Seeing, hearing and experienceing this type of abuse on daily basis, it's no wonder why we're seeing these types of questions here at Yahoo!Answers alone... Imagine just how many Men out there have the same question in their minds day-in and day-out even in the loving and caring relationship.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, EVERY Guy is normal no matter what the rest of the population says. It takes love, care, patience, and understanding to love the Man for WHO he is on inside and never judge him or his abilities by the southern department of his body. When everyone says all of that to a Man what you have as a result are bad relationships, miscommunication, anger, anxiety, and insanity. And, after all of that everyone's wondering why Men are acting the way they are when others (even women in most of their lives) are telling them that to "help" or "assist" them in this. With that type of assistance what Man in his right mind will act normal anymore? When will it be the day when the society will not be so judgemental of Men, especially when it comes to intimacy (i.e.: in any shape and form) and relationships (i.e.: having feelings / emotions and showing them)?<br>  <br>  Am I making sense here?|`|AA10919107	i agree with you its the same old question|`|AA11614574	all the men are insecure about there size apparantly ;-)|`|f563dba95ff1b5857c019e80f4b069d1aa	i agree with melykiskv they are insecure...and they are all young boys wondering what the ideal size for their age is.... how stupid is that......girls dont ask what the RIGHT size for our breast are... its cuz we DONT CARE|`|AA12234666	You've seen 50 pefect penises?

AA11143469	Definitely Not!<br>  Remember the old Cliche,<br>  Cleanliness is next to Godliness.<br>  Here are 2 different reccomended ways to get the best shave.<br>  Want a wet shave, Try this.<br>  Use the Gillette Mach Razor and shave using Shave Secret.<br>  I buy mine from the link below<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=190000804816" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...</a><br>  The other method is a dry method and this works great. <br>  Seiko S-Yard Cleancut shaver and a trimmer.<br>  Found here at the link below.<br>  <a href="http://www.body4real.co.uk/product.php?productid=17868" rel="nofollow">http://www.body4real.co.uk/product.php?p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Body shaving is best achieved if these basic rules are followed.<br>  <br>  Wash the skin first with warm, not hot, not cold, water so that the skin is very clean. <br>  Stand in the bathtub so you don’t make a mess. (Men use a drain basket so you don’t clog the drains.) <br>  Use a new blade or new disposable razor. The sharper it is the less it will nick. <br>  Let the shaving gel work on the skin before beginning the shave. <br>  Do a section at a time, not the whole body at once! <br>  Pull loose skin taut with the fingers of the hand that isn’t holding the razor. <br>  Don’t press! The lightest touch will shave just as close as a dig but will be less likely to cut the skin. <br>  Hairy men, for your first shave, reduce the length of the body hair with a beard trimmer or hair clippers or scissors, but keep those blades off the skin itself. <br>  Avoid the temptation to attempt shaving your own back. Sideways movement of a razor will make a straight cut through your skin. <br>  If it’s called after-shave, it’s alcohol and it’s going to sting and hurt. All after-shave smells terrible anyway! Buy some witch-hazel to use after your shave. This amazing natural liquid will reduce razor-burn and help prevent the open pores from becoming infected or producing acne. Don’t use pore-clogging cream after your shave! <br>  Happy Shaving!<br>  <br>  Here is another great guideline for a Total Body Shaving Guide.<br>  <a href="http://www.the-vu.com/total_body_shaving_guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-vu.com/total_body_shaving...</a>|`|0a47ee63b277f281778766aada3c0c02aa	Personally, I think its sexy when a guy has some hair down there.

Than average is between 5 1/2" to 6".<br>  <br>  Therefore it is only natural to believe this simple chart:<br>  <br>  ----------SMALL  ------AVERAGE-------------   LARGE<br>  BELOW 5 1/2"----------5 1/2" to 6"-----------ABOVE 6"--------<br>  <br>  Of course you could say mines bigger than yours and all that other crap.

If not....ask!<br>  What could that hurt?

In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.<br>  <br>  The truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind – that can be LOTS of fun.<br>  <br>  The truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.

AA11168385	While there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.<br>  <br>  Men are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.<br>  <br>  The truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.<br>  <br>  The truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind – that can be LOTS of fun.<br>  <br>  The truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl’s clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.|`|db906faa1e865713523b12a88131bcdbaa	I'm white.I had myself a 17cm hard time and 10cm soft time!|`|5d7375ecfda4fefeec3730aebf37811caa	ummmm ahhh lets see sorry i have pussy and quit asking people 4 their size dang u ask the same thing way to much <br>  OK Lil' boy<br>  <br>  i have no dick <br>  oh yea I'm white got a problem w/ that|`|891607bb2acc41389bccc9117d2cc9f4aa	71/2in.

0d8ced59212a7d77617d180ef03e1b32aa	I hear that it's normal for young people to sleepwalk. My mom said I did it at about her age. Usually it's going to the bathroom (not necessarily in the toilet lol) or getting a drink. (My little brother did this around that age, but he couldn't quite get the door open.) It's normal for people to act out their dreams in this state and your only concern is for her safety. You don't want her wandering the streets or calling 911 in her sleep, but she'll be fine otherwise. I hear it isn't recommended to wake them up because it creates confusion. I think you can talk to them sometimes and try to figure out what they think they are doing so you can coax them back to bed. I don't recall at which stages your body is paralyzed during sleep, but I know it isn't all night which is why this happens. For further advise google for sleepwalking on a medical or sleep related site.|`|AA11371298	And ya question is? thats just normal!

El Dr. Giles pone de manifiesto que esta investigación previa estaba más centrada en la relación sexual en sí, en donde las infecciones de transmisión sexual podían tener mucha importancia para estos hallazgos. <br>  <br>  Por el contrario, su estudio se centra en la masturbación y “los hombres disponen de otra forma de emplear su próstata sin la participación de las mujeres ni de otros hombres” concluye el Dr. Giles.|`|AA10064223	NO.

3fc21305ef51013654eb8e1a5e03daf3aa	I know how you feel.  Luckily, I did have insurance and after two attacks, I went to the doctor and scheduled surgery.<br>  <br>  I learned that you need to consume foods low in fat and oils.  I'll never forget the day I roasted a chicken and vegetables.  The vegetables tasted awesome, but because they cooked in the fat and juices with the chicken, they were highly concentrated with oil and fat.  I had a gnarly attack that night and I suffered for about an hour and then pain subsided and went away.  STAY AWAY FROM MILK!!!  It contains lots of FAT.  Please switch to Soy Milk and I recommend Silk.  It tastes better than milk and is healthier for you.  No french fries, no fatty burgers, no cheese, no Italian dressing on your salad (oil) b/c it will trigger an attack.  I know it sucks to not enjoy food, but give your body a break for a while and then gradually try foods you used to like, but in moderation.<br>  <br>  Even after my surgery, I've had two more attacks, but after six months of eating right, I've been able to enjoy some oily and fatty foods without having an attack.<br>  <br>  I know the feeling when you put something in your mouth you have this fear wondering if this food will trigger an attack.  I still have some uncomfortable feelings in my gut, but nothing compares to those attacks.  The first attack was late at night and I literally collapsed on the floor and I was drooling on myself because I couldn't breathe... My husband had to drive me and our two kids to the emergency room where I received the pain relief.  Your doctor should also be able to prescribe some Vicodin so when you feel the pain come on you can take it to relieve yourself somewhat.  However, Vicodin is addictive and if you don't plan on having the surgery, you could become addicted and rely on drugs to relieve your pain.  Not cool.<br>  <br>  Eat oatmeal in the morning, drink soy milk or orange juice (small amount of orange juice b/c its acidic; but it never bothered me).  I also remember eating lots of toast with a little bit of butter (butter could set you off so be careful; again, butter never bothered me).  For dinners, I remember eating cereals with whole grains and raisins.  Also, I never lost any weight eating this way (bummer) but I was so scared of eating anything it was a complete drag.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could just have the surgery and work out a plan to pay back the money in monthly installments.  I had a baby in April 2005 and my gall bladder removed in May of 2005 and after receiving all the bills and having to pay my portion of those bills, I learned hospitals provide care to the COMMUNITY and being strapped for money, as I was too, they promise to work with you if you have a hardship or if you are simply unable to pay.  St. Joseph Hospital delivered my baby girl and when I was in a bind to come up with the $2,000 on just ONE of the bills, they let me pay $100 a month (an amount I requsted).  I paid the $100 and eventually paid it off altogether, but their representative sent me a form to see if I could qualify to pay less than the amount billed.  Please try this and talk with your doctor/surgeon about where you are and living in this condition makes life intolerable.<br>  <br>  Please seek help and good well.  Eat healthy and blandly for a while to help alleviate your pain.  Good luck to you...|`|8c502a13b68ec514dab3e14224cec6ceaa	From the Medical point of view and remaining anonymous:<br>  <br>  Drink (1 cup)  - do this for couple of months: <br>  Mornings - Sodium Bicarbonate with Citric Acid (ENO Fruit Salts)<br>  Lunch time - Cranberry Juice <br>  Dinner - Apple Cider Vinegar <br>  <br>  I guess you can do it either way...thot i put it as a guide.|`|AA10148319	My *** hurts.

Subo y bajo el pecho, 3 series de 15 y conforme pasa el tiempo hay que ir aumentando las series y las repeticiones.<br>  Se sube hasta donde se pueda, no hacerlas rápido, y hay que tensar el abdomen.<br>  <br>  2. En la misma posición, las mismas series y colocación de las manos, pero subiendo las piernas flexionadas. Cuando se hace el mayor esfuerzo se tira el aire y cuando se tiene relajamiento hay que tomarlo. <br>  <br>  3. Con las manos arregostadas al suelo y las piernas flexionadas, llevo las rodillas al pecho y bajar. Subiendo igualmente la parte del tronco. Hay que tener una postura recta y hacer los ejercicios despacio. Y no dejar de tensar el abdomen.<br>  <br>   4. Acostados con las manos hacia los lados del cuerpo colocando las manos al lado. Las piernas un poco inclinadas elevando la pelvis, la cadera sin necesidad que la espalda se despegue del suelo. Subir y bajar repetidas veces. Y tener el abdomen contraído. <br>   descansa es muy importante para ver resultados.|`|511de820aaed2c7c63f309bad2dc0740aa	Puedes encontrar dietas en www.formarse.com, tienen muchas dietas y puedes escoger la mejor q te paresca.

03745f4a7966003d33bc8ec8951c552faa	I've sold natural supplements for 25 years as both retailer and a broker. I think SAMe might be your best bet. It was originally formulated as a joint health care remedy. I used it after blowing out both knees snow skiing. But along the way it was discovered that it really seemed to be a mood elevator as well. I really like NADH too. It gives energy without any spazzy side effects. Perfect for the golf course or any activity that requires calm but energy at once.|`|36bac331cebca0ff643360d9fc218118aa	SAM-E. you can get it anywhere these days.

My MIL took St. John's wort for depression and anxiety with some success, and she is severely clinically depressed.  My aunt also swears by B complex vitamins for mood and energy.<br>  <br>  Getting regular exercise, adequate sleep, and laying off the carbs/sugar is definitely NOT going to hurt.  I notice that if I'm eating a lot of sugary foods, I CRAVE sugary foods...in a big bad way.  It definitely affects my moods at certain times during my menstrual cycle, making me crankier or tearier than usual.  It also seems to compound other PMS symptoms like bloating, weight gain, and cramping.  Try the South Beach Diet.  It's not a fad; it's actually a very healthy diet that you stick to for the rest of your life.  You lose a ton of excess weight and it reduces your cholesterol and chances of developing diabetes or heart disease.<br>  <br>  Can't hurt. :)|`|b266ee5c193ec4459bd2886dd19dd68caa	B-complex.

AA11412999	I'm not sure what clomid is, but I'm guessing it's an antibiotic.  It's true that sometimes we produce more wetness at certain times of the month, but a constant drip-drip-drip that is more than you are used to is cause for concern.  <br>  <br>  Other causes for concern would be an unpleasant odor - fishy, sour, "rotten", or...just...unhealthy smelling - and unusual colour leaning toward green.  It is common for vaginal discharge to be white to pale yellow, clear to "milky", and watery to mucousy-thick.  It just depends on the time of month, what you eat, stress level, etc.  And healthy vaginal discharge does have an odour, but it should smell musky, and be fairly faint.  Perhaps sweet-ish.  It is not an unpleasant odour.  It just smells...female.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, or what your sexual history is.  But if you've had sex with anyone new within the past month, especially unprotected sex, strange/unusual vaginal discharge is often a sign of infection.  If that's the case, be thankful you have any symptoms!  About half of infected women don't have symptoms, and pass it on to other partners unknowingly.  Your doctor probably took a swab to be tested for infection, right?<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is some sort of abnormality going on with your cervix, which could cause unusual discharges as well.  If she hasn't already, ask your doctor for a PAP test.  This checks your cervix for cancerous or pre-cancerous cells, and it should be part of every sexually-active woman's yearly physical check-up.|`|AA10847776	Did she tell you WHY she was giving you Clomid??

5d643e970b8a5e21d0288feffe91a1b3aa	The "pop" in your foot sounds harmless, as long as it continues to cause you no pain.  It sounds like the same kind of sound you hear when your knuckles crack.

Já leram a bula desses medicamentos? <br>  Quantos efeitos colaterais e contra indica??es!!!!<br>  No caso da "maconha", pode-se instigar a beber mais líquido, abrir o apetite (tanto é que usam-se os doentes que fazem quimioterapia, aidéticos...), relaxamento, concentra??o,apura??o da memória visual e até intelectual, tornando o indivíduo com mais criatividade; sendo usada, como já comprovado em estudos científicos, por artistas, literários...<br>  Assim como bebidas contendo alcool s?o permitidas a maiores de 18 anos; a maconha poderia ser legalizada, observando-se os critérios lógicos, obviamente, com informa??es sobre a dosagem, as doses terapêuticas!|`|7b0442be113e47dc574d1a67d1c6381faa	Papo careta.......<br>  Talvez porque se você estivesse sendo operado em algum bloco cirúrgico, n?o gostaria de ver o teu médico, "numa boa" ou o piloto do avi?o que  transporta você e sua familia, com os reflexos alterados, assim como o controlador de v?o.Tudo aquilo que altere o seu sentidos e a maneira de reagir prontamente, tem que ser devidamente analisado, até remédios, mesmos prescritos, tem certas restri??es. <br>  Já vivemos em um país cheio de problemas, imagina todo mundo "chapado", como ia ser.<br>  Toda vez que alguém acende um cigarro natural, refor?a os traficantes e depois ficam a mercê da própria violência por vocês autorgada.

b8769d58074b8c6a8d7959676c1282d0aa	the spleen acts as kind of a junkyard for the body.  when red blood cells die in the body, they travel to the spleen and are recycled there into waste product. so it does act as kind of a recycling plant for red blood cells.  it also helps with immune functions.  you dont NEED a spleen as it is not a vital organ and just works to recycle waste products.  however, if the spleen bursts, it can cause MAJOR problems as your abdomen can fill with blood which is full of waste products..these waste products can then fester in your abdomen and cause major infection.|`|3f77b971a45ceb9c75365372cc365229aa	It helps to protect your immune system.

b845752fe1a81266746c1f68e850090baa	As tired as I am, I had to answer, seeing as how I spent 20 tears of my life with a debilitating cough. It's gone now, so I'm sure I can help. <br>  <br>  Cough syrup was useless for my bronchial spasms. Beyond that, it's just not healthy to pound away at your brain with narcotic-like substances in a clumsy attempt to control the cough. Let's get to the source:<br>  <br>  In the short run, post-nasal drip is a big factor. The mucus runs down the back of the throat, acting as a nutrient base for bacteria and fungi, and causing your bronchials to spasm in an attempt to expell the mucus. At the first sign of nasal congestion, take an antihistamine and spray your nasal passage with a gentle non-addictive formula.<br>  <br>  When the coughing just wouldn't stop, and I had to sleep, I dabbed my throat with Anbesol, which numbed the affected area and stopped the spasms.<br>  <br>  I gargle every night with Hydrogen Peroxide (3% solution) to kill off any bacteria or fungi in my throat, and keep infection from migrating to my lungs.<br>  <br>  In the long run, you are going to have to identify the environmental causes for your upper respiratory distress. Here are some typical culprits:<br>  <br>  Pet dander and hair<br>  Mold in walls, ceilings, a/c equipment and ducts<br>  Dirty a/c filter  <br>  Dirty carpet<br>  kitty litter box<br>  old mattress<br>  old pillows<br>  chemical cleaners<br>  room deodorizers (loaded with formaldehyde, a known carcenogen)<br>  pollen<br>  food allergies(milk, wheat, peanuts)<br>  emotional stress<br>  immune disorders<br>  exposure to pathegens (school-age children, house guests)<br>  <br>  I know that is more than you asked for, but my gut tells me your condition is more chronic than your question implies. I hope this proves to be of some help.|`|AA10284235	For stopping a cough, nothing better than a loud fart! (or was it viceversa?)<br>  :-)|`|c5bffad93e013270ab657c63a722ccd0aa	hot water with sniffing crystals in it, these clear your sinuses witch can be a big part of the problem<br>  Hang on im Irish, too sensible an answer for me!...... Whiskey!<br>  Hot water, whiskey an a bit of sugar.<br>  I suffer bad with my throaght an this normally helps, <br>  hops it works for u too X|`|e3bf19006dd7d88d18b08b6ddbd41c70aa	Did the cough med he gave you contain codeine? codeine is a very powerful cough suppressant, and since it causes some drowsiness, it's good for helping to suppress your cough and allowing you to sleep (if taken during the day you don't want to drive, etc). You can buy small bottles of codeine cough syrup (by signing for them) at your pharmacy...ask the pharmacists.<br>  <br>  if that is what he gave you, there's another med that might help you that he can prescribe - it's call Tessalon Pearls or Benzontate...they are small capsules and are a great cough suppressant that doesn't cause much drowsiness. they work in a totally different way than the codeine.<br>  <br>  other than that my only suggestion is to try to elevate your head more while sleeping, as lying flat can make coughing worse...or try taking a steamy shower to open up and moisturize your airway (also helps to make coughs more productive). Robitussin DM is a good OTC cough suppressant as well, though not as strong as the ones mentioned above.|`|fa93a6a55a11bac9d9bdbe42722fa6d3aa	So sorry about your cough...I've had a chronic cough for a year now.really. Mine is most likely due to allergies, post nasal drip and chronic bronchitis. A few things that help control my cough is stop drinking cold drinks while you have this cold. Drink room temp. drinks only. The lungs constrict when cold and drinking iced drinks isn't good. Also, talking makes it worse. If you can be quiet for a few days it will help. Drink plenty of water to wash out your system too. If after a couple of weeks you're still coughing see your Doctor. Also watch for changes in your cough. If you're coughing up phlegm and it's clear it's ok. If it's yellow-to-green it's not good call the Dr. could be bronchitis or pneumonia. Take care of yourself.|`|1b06679f1e0cda3a358e3ddc08c8f2bfaa	Anything that coats the throat.

2de840db96953afc0c672e08595f4adcaa	Feeling sad or blue is different from having a depressive illness.   The name can be misleading, because yes, one can feel depressed from time to time; everybody experiences that.  <br>  <br>  Major depression and other psychiatric illnesses have criterea that must be fulfilled in order to make a diagnosis.  These criterea are in place so that health care providers can make meaningful and competent decisions about treatment.  <br>  <br>  If there is any concern that you or someone you know might be depressed, or have other mental health issues, your doctor can guide you in the direction of getting appropriate mental health services to do an assessment.  <br>  <br>  Having said this, I think that education would be the best way to increase awareness of the potential signs of mental illness, and how this might be different from what might be considered "normal." Things have improved over the years in this regard, but there is still much work to be done!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|f78c0895538ae99df62c5df673b7c5aaaa	When the APA talks about Depression they do catagorize it based on the state of the depression and howlong someone has been depressed.

En su lugar en la mayor parte de Latinoamérica y en Espa?a se utiliza ?mamar?. En Argentina y Uruguay no hay un verbo específico que reemplace a ?felar?, por eso se deben usar perífrasis, como ?chupar la ver*a? (de donde surge el sustantivo relativo ?chupada?), también es popular la expresión ?hacer un pete? o simplemente ?pete?(contracción de la palabra ?chupete?), , con su considerado muy vulgar verbo "petear" o también ?tirar la goma?. En Chile también se le conoce como ?chupada de pico? ó simplemente como un ?mamón? que viene del verbo mamar. En Brasil es común utilizar la expresión ?boquete?.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  Una de las principales razones por las que las mujeres no practican el "sexo oral", es simplemente porque les da asco, ya sabeis que son muy imaginativas, y ellas piensan que uno no se ha lavado bien el pene, y que huele mal, ?cuantas veces no vamos al ba?o nosotros los hombres a orinar?, y no nos lavamos.<br>  Mas que nada es por eso, y porque piensan que es una forma de "perversion" de los hombres, lo que no saben, es que es tan delicioso hacerlo, pero es solo cuestion de gustos, y de que la persona a la que le vayan a hacer el sexo oral, sea limpia.

eb6b86e9ac0aa989807321d46255e9c5aa	Exercise is the best way, short of pharmacuticals, to diffuse tension. Also be aware of how you sit, for example if you sit at a computer watch your posture & how you hold your head, neck & shoulders. Just being aware of what muscles are tense & consciously relaxing them will help. Most tension headaches result from sustained muscle tension.  Go online: there are sites devoted to headache. Headaches can result from eye strain, tension, drug effects, allergies - a myriad of causes. I found out I was allergic to the cultures in cheese, yogurt, buttermilk, and chocolate. Once I discovered that & cut those items out of my diet, my headaches were cut dramatically. I also take Feverfew, an herb, to prevent vascular headaches, which is what my bad headaches were (much like migraines). I was missing one to two days a month from work with severe headaches, started Feverfew & haven't had one of those headaches in 10 years or better. You have to take it for 3 months or so to see results but it works for me. There are lots of herbal things that are good for tension, like Valerian & Kava - you can find them at the health food store or on-line vitamin catalogs.<br>  Good luck!|`|4fff4a7a8d6490c7b25c032272b1c44aaa	try walking in your garden without your shoes.<br>  it's really relaxing.|`|AA11118886	Dampen (get it wet) a small towel, place folded in the microwave for 40 seconds.  It will be quite warm... Go the a recliner or sofa with it and lay it on your face while you lay back and relax.  Before it cools place it on the back of your neck.  As it cools, do it again.

df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Cutting itself is not so difficult.  It principally requires that you just not eat.  You cannot live on protein powders alone, they will poison you.  Nor, can you be perfectly "cut" all the time.  It's just not healthy.  6 pack OK, always 8 pack...well that's really pushing the fat down, and only the most superior natural athlete can keep their fat that low and be healthy.  <br>  <br>  I don't reccomend using information of the internet to do this sort of thing.

As far as cutting goes, find a product and follow the directions.  oh, ya, always ask your doctor...|`|2b6db4fccd6e450776de7eeb53bfba76aa	Use protein powder right after you work out.  I would say you have about a half hour window when your body is primed to take it.  I wouldn't just take it then though.  I usually do 3 protein shakes a day along with lean protein like chicken and fish, and egg whites.  I only have my carbs in the morning in Oatmeal.<br>  If you want to build mass I am not to sure how you would go about it as I am already pretty big.  I would go with low rep higher weight when lifting, and you can also include a weight gainer to increase mass.<br>  <br>  As far as the protein shakes go I would recommend "CytoSport, Muscle Milk".

Not your total weight, but just muscle weight.  You need to get on a BMI meter to calculate that.  You should take protein both BEFORE (30 minutes) and AFTER a weight workout.  Before gives your muscles energy for a more intense workout, after gives your muscles food to start growing/repairing.  You should limit protein powders to 30-40% of your intake--the rest should be natural sources.|`|AA11801045	Protein 3 times a day (minimum). First thing in the morning, within 15 minutes of finishing your workout and right before you go to bed. Put 5 grams of glutamine in each shake. Add water right before you drink the shake and drink it within 20 seconds of shaking it. Eat protein bars too. Also lean protein such as boneless skinless chicken breast, tuna etc. Try to get at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.<br>  Forget the bow flex and join a gym. Use only free weights - no machines. Get a programs from someone who knows what they are talking about. Probably not a personal trainer as most of them only know one program they give everyone.<br>  Go as heavy as you can, with lower reps.

A search using FIBROMYAGIA and/or MPS might be rewarding as they are often lumped together.
2de840db96953afc0c672e08595f4adcaa	No, they are not.  There is a very small subset of autistic people who have prodigious talent in one or more areas.  This could be in art, preformance, calculating, memorizing facts.  <br>  <br>  Actually, autism is thought of as being a deficit in social communication.  This can involve language functioning, but does not always.  Often it is associated with mental retardation, but not necessarily.  There is a huge spectrum of deficit in folks with Autistic Disorder, from those with mild impairment to those who are profoundly affected and communicate hardly at all. And there is not one uniform consensus about how to make the diagnosis.  Autistic disorder may, in fact, be a spectrum of disorders that are related but have different neuropathophysiology.  There has been some thought that vaccines have been associated with the genesis of Autism, but epidemiologists have looked at the data and have not found it convincing.  And as of yet, there is no cure for the core symptoms of Autistic disorder, though medications can be effective in treating other problems that can be associate with it, such as agggressiveness, hyperactivity, anxious traits, self stimulatory/self abusive behaviors or mood disturbance.  In my practice as a child psychiatrist, I have treated many children and adolescents with Autism for these issues, and have come to enjoy very much working with this population.|`|9ae5a7887ad64359278d22a16ddcda71aa	Autistic people have different gifts.

AA10746164	What is morning sickness? <br>  <br>  <br>  Morning sickness can range from mild, occasional nausea to severe, continuous, disabling nausea with bouts of vomiting. Symptoms may be worse in the morning, though they can strike at any time of the day or night. <br>  <br>  Although its cause is poorly understood, morning sickness has been linked to increasing estrogen levels, along with other hormone changes during early pregnancy.1<br>  <br>  The first signs of morning sickness usually develop during the month following the first missed menstrual period, when hormone levels increase. <br>  Women carrying twins or more have more pronounced hormone increases and tend to have more severe morning sickness. <br>  Unfortunately, there is no way of predicting how long your morning sickness will last, even if you have suffered through it before. Nausea and vomiting last an average of 35 days. However, about 1 in 10 women continue to feel ill beyond their 22nd week of pregnancy.1|`|49fc5f6f26ea156d92e5a4d05488ef3aaa	It is very individual with the woman, and even with the pregnancy.

AA10515207	Check out Curves.  It's a circuit training workout that you only have to do 3 times a week for 30 minutes each time.  The first time you go they weigh you, measure different parts of your body (bust, waist, etc.) and do a BMI.  They'll show you how to use the equipment and stay with you every time you come in until you feel comfortable going it alone.  It's very easy to do--almost deceptively so, but you'll see results very quickly.<br>  <br>  You do one piece of equipment for 35 SECONDS and then move to a cardio station for another 35 sec., on to the next equipment, etc.  You don't do one piece long enough to get bored or sore.  They play good music that keeps you going and interspersed is a reminder of when it's time to change stations.  They also tell you when you need to step away to take a 10-second pulse rate.  There's a chart that gives ages and target rates so you know how you're doing.<br>  <br>  Nice part is is that it's for women only and no kids are allowed so you can go in, do your workout and get home with a minimum of fuss.  You don't have to worry about special clothes or how your make-up looks to impress anyone.<br>  <br>  The rates are very reasonable and they have payment plans for you to consider.  You can pay by cash/check/credit card.<br>  <br>  Each month they will weigh you and also measure you.  Then they enter the info into their computer and print off the results, comparing them to previous months.<br>  <br>  They have a nutrition class you can attend for a small additional fee.<br>  <br>  The women who go there are of different ages and different backgrounds.  I've found them to be very supportive and fun to work out with (if you don't want to talk, no one makes you--it's strictly your exercise time).|`|c8cead39b7842363797af554943b251baa	To lose weight, a person has to reduce the calorie intake by some amount by modifying their diet. A diet  without sufficient nutrients will only increase the appetite of the person trying to lose weight. Since most people combine a diet with an exercise plan, additional nutrients are required for the growth of muscles required to increase the metabolic rate required for long term weight loss.

Being on your period should make no difference.  Some women's iron levels drop when they are on their period, but had yours dropped too low, they wouldn't have let you give blood.  That is why they take a drop of blood from your finger and see if it sinks in the funny solution.
864bfcedfc55838c50aff011dec2773faa	I had the same problem when I took the pill, but I stayed on the pill for a while too. I think you should ask your doctor about something else you can take.

I just gained a certain amount of weight and stayed there. But you should not worry so much.|`|3e16154a0133e26931ae287b983d2e0aaa	It happens sometimes when taking the pill. all i can say is keep up ur dieting, and working out..... and maybe ask your doctor if theres maybe a different type of pills that maybe wont make you gain weight, ive been on the pill for a year, b/c of my heavy flow, horrible cramps, and very irregular periods, and i havnt really gained weight, but i have friends that have, and they couldnt do much, you should stop gaining weight soon, but idk, jus talk to ur doctor to see if theres something else you can take. good luck|`|AA10738279	I was put on the pill for heavy bleeding and irregular periods in my teens.  Because of hormonal changes, my doc told me to expect to gain about 5lbs. when I first started taking them and then the weight gain would taper off.  After taking them for a few months, by staying active and watching what I ate for a little while, I dropped those 5 lbs.  You've gained 6, so that is right in the area my doc told me to expect at first.  Some women, and they are the exception, not the rule, keep gaining weight while on the pill and nothing helps except going off it.  Just watch your diet for a few more mos., try to move around a little more than usual, and you will probably get back to your normal weight once your body gets used to the hormonal changes.  Good luck!|`|b1727987e919043c44d4efc2f69c1813aa	maybe the type of pill you are taking is the problem. there are many different variations of hormones. is there a specific time of the month you notice the weight gain? are you taking multi level hormones or one dose all month? if it is multi level, is the gain during a certain week? def talk to your doctor. they will find the right one for you. they won't know if you don't tell them.|`|d544e85a02caa86d97828eae455efafdaa	i am not exactly sure what a yamin pill is, but you should definately keep taking the pill, expecially since your periods cause you so much pain. maybe you should actually change the foods you eat, even if this may not be the cause. it could still help you lose weight. good luck to you sweetie:)|`|f12f5be72b9973bd590b4b46bea7f2c2aa	Don't quit taking the pill until you talk to your doctor. He  may be able to prescribe a different kind for you. The same thing happened to a friend of mine.|`|5db41ddb525e64e8cdbfc3ee18336773aa	Weight gain is one of the side effects.

There are plenty out there.  <br>  good luck|`|8ba6a1763e2363f6da5d202d62fc504aaa	It's completely normal for your weight to fluctuate like that. It's probably not the pill since the pill is not proven to cause weight gain. Four pounds isn't anything to worry about unless your anorexic. Everyones weight will change a few pounds throughout the day. It really depends on how much you are eating and what time of the day you are weighing yourself.  You also may be gaining muscle weight as you do work out quite a lot. Don't go off the pill. Talk to your doctor.

On the 12th thru the 16-17th are the days you are the most fertile , therefore the most likely to get pregnant.  If a person does NOT want to get pregnant, have sex during, the next few days after, or the few days before you are due to start your period if you are real regular and use a condom.

Every woman is different and each cycle is different, depending on when you ovulate, how stressed you are, etc. One woman could be 14 day midcycle, while another is 16, 18 or even 20. Generally speaking, you are the most fertile when you have a strechy/ egg whitey cervical fluid discharge near ovulation- it acts as nourishment for the sperm to travel in (like a guy's seminal fluid) and midway during your cycle.

Una madre que por salvar a su hijo pierde su vida nos muestra como claramente eligió lo que era para ella un bien estando viva.<br>  <br>  Quien se suicida lo que nos dice no es que elige, sino que ya no se encuentra en condiciones de elegir.<br>  <br>  A veces puede tener que ver con una situación extrema, no aguantas más que te torturen y para no comprometer a tus compa?eros te suicidas para que ya no te vejen más.<br>  <br>  Pero en otras -y creo que son la mayoría- tiene que ver con la enfermedad, por llamar de alguna manera a eso que le pasa a esa persona que no puede ver cómo, si sigue viva, va a tener oportunidad de lograr que las cosas cambien.<br>  <br>  Impedirle a alguien que se mate no es quitarle libertad de hacer algo con su vida, por el contrario es si permitirle que pueda, luego, al seguir viviendo hacer algo por su vida.<br>  <br>  Ocupémonos de ser libres pero en nuestro caso nuestro ser se manifiesta en el vivir.<br>  <br>  Luego de muertos nada somos. El recuerdo de los otros -que si, están vivos- no nos agrega ni nos quita un ápice. ?Que le hace a Colón que estemos cerca del 12 de Octubre?<br>  <br>  Vive que hasta para pensar en la muerte hay que estar vivo.<br>  <br>  Un voto por la vida y comprensión para quien no valora su propia vida.|`|5ab58c48ca9fcbe0070f54562f5c75f9aa	No he pensado en eso pero creo que quienes lo deciden no son personas ni valientes ni cobardes, son personas cegadas por la tristeza y desesperación que les nubla la razón por un instante.|`|8a60e9b460ff983bb590b96baea45c49aa	la verdad no y pienso k la gente necesita mas amor y atencion, una meta k seguir, asi su vida tendra un sentido y la valoraran mas|`|ccd80023082df0850b40e7efa8655a24aa	Si lo pense algunas veces pero ya me di cuenta de que soy muy cobarde como para algun dia intentarlo|`|d194e6df5dfb2bb258321974c73f2ed5aa	Jamas pense en ello. <br>  Pienso que para quienes si piensan en ello es una decision dificil de tomar, que solo se tiene en momentos de deseperacion y soledad (un combo mortal).<br>  Procuremos siempre estar con personas que sepamos que vamos a poder acudir en momentos malos.|`|41577331e59b38f7bef2bc1234bb600daa	No, y pienso que quienes lo hacen son infelices mentales|`|41bde643c25ae483cec3ed68fb23ae63aa	Sí, hace 6 a?os, con 23 pero tenía una depresión muy grave.Yo pienso que el factor que más puede hacerte pensar en el suicidio es la soledad.Evitando la soledad y el alcohol(etc...), con alguna afición que te distraiga, el 90% está controlado, el 10 restante es o una depresión pasajera (endógena o reactiva), que hace que el juicio esté distorsionado y puede llevarte a este error, o una situación extremadamente difíci(enfermedad degenerativa...)<br>  Opino que quién lo hace pasa por una depresión y no está en su sano juicio, en el 99% de los casos.Yo no hablo con nadie y tengo una enfermedad gravísima, supongo q la mayoría de la gente pensaría mejor estar muerto pero yo me entretengo, dibujo, paseo....|`|428634738864c4dc766d323461dc8b13aa	Te confieso honestamente, en lo personal nunca me ha pasado por la mente hacerlo, de igual manera tampoco me atrevería a cuestionar o juzgar a toda aquella persona que en su momento lo hizo, y lo que si lanzaría unas palabras de aliento para aquellos que por su mente les a pasado, que en verdad este pasaje por esta escuela que se llama vida es todo aprendizaje y que tengan el temple para poder visualizar la vida desde un ángulo diferente a la que los observamos con esa cortina de humo que se llaman problemas, si logran tener la fortaleza para liberar en su interno al verdadero ser que llevan dentro no el que creemos ser la vida es maravillosa, y de verdad que no hay argumento valido para arrebatárnosla y mucho menos quitársela a otro ser humano.

AA11120344	As far as I know there is no vacine. it is transmitted through the air in a cough or such. My mom had TB and no one else in our family got it. Some people are immune to it.<br>  The best way would be to ware a mask or have the person affected with it ware one|`|AA10738279	It's hard because tuberculosis is an airborne disease, meaning every time someone with it coughs or sneezes, etc. causes it to get in the air and anyone close enough to breathe that air can catch it. That is why people with it are usually put in hospitals just for that to keep it from becoming an epidemic like it used to be before antibiotics and penicillin were invented. Since people are vaccinated for that before you can even start school, it is very seldom you see anyone with TB anymore except in third world countries.|`|51b000f312ab4c939ca1126d496f6b9baa	You must avoid contact, especially breathing close to the patient.<br>  There is vaccine available, called BCG.

AA10192128	What you saw was a seaweed face mask.<br>  You can also do mud face masks....<br>  The Korean women mostly use face masks whilst they are in sauna.

The whole point of it is to open your pores, having something over them will only hinder that. Instead, use an exfoliating cleanser on your whole body(one specifically for the face, though) before getting in. After you are through you can use a purifying or pore refining mask following it's instructions, rinsing in a warm shower(hot water will dry you out). Apply lotion after the shower to best hydrate your skin. And rinse your face with cool water to close your pores. The best time to apply lotion to your face if you are acne prone is before bed time. They make lotions specifically for this purpose and they work great.

I know it sounds crazy but this makes your metabolism active. because when you don't eat enough your depriving your body of the essentials you need to lose the weight|`|1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	Healthy weight loss tips<br>  <br>  <br>      * Take one pound at a time<br>        Don’t get overwhelmed by how much weight you need to lose. Try to remember that "losing 15 pounds in two weeks" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.<br>  <br>        Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.<br>  <br>        Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Set Reachable Goals<br>        For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.<br>  <br>        The same logic applies for losing weight.<br>  <br>      * Stay off the scales<br>        Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.<br>  <br>        If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.<br>  <br>      * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin<br>        # Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.<br>  <br>      * Fat Free?<br>        We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of water<br>        Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.<br>  <br>      * Reward yourself<br>        # Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.<br>  <br>      * Seek help if you need it<br>        # A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.<br>  <br>      * Watch your portions<br>        With the advent of "supersize" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a "plate cleaner" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.<br>  <br>      * Eat your food slowly<br>        Did you ever notice that thin people take an awfully long time to eat their food? Eating slowly is one method that can help take off pounds. That's because from the time you begin eating it takes the brain 20 minutes to start signaling feelings of fullness. Fast eaters often eat beyond their true level of fullness before the 20 minute signal has had a chance to set in. The amount of calories consumed before you begin to feel full can vary significantly depending on how quickly you eat. So slow down, take smaller bites and enjoy your food.|`|6c2d67d35428a0ba09bb666bb3761a03aa	Start off by excercising and losing the amt of weight you want to lose. Limit the amount of excessivly fatty or sweet foods you eat. When the excess weight is lost, join a dance team or other active sport such as hockey, in order to stay fit and help prevent gaining the weight again. Hope that makes sense and helps.|`|0981c5cd8d3d4a2130ef29a417bd9fd7aa	-Eat healthy foods. That means no chips, fried foods, etc.<br>  -Exercise.

You don't need to lose any weight. At your height you should weigh between 105-130 pounds (47.6-59 kilograms) to avoid weight-related health risks.<br>  <br>  Keep eating the way you are now! Though throwing some exercise in can lower your risk in the future for other health problems, including but not limited to cardiovascular illness, type II diabetes (NIDDM), and even can reduce stress! Go for walks, take up jogging, join a gym (I prefer running because it's cheap, though). Just stay active and you can keep yourself from becoming overweight in the future. Remember you're at a healthy weight now, so don't become fanatical about it.<br>  <br>  Any other questions about what to do you can message me!|`|AA11096432	Check your BMI on the internet.<br>  <br>  If you are overweight, you need to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. The 45 minute thing is not true, but don't over 60 minutes at a time.<br>  <br>  Do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.<br>  <br>  The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!<br>  <br>  Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stick at it.|`|AA10299265	Actually, you couldn't be more 'ideal', weightwise.<br>  <br>  Here's a little page I put together with some really good tips on weight loss:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/weightloss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/weig...</a><br>  <br>  Down near the bottom, you'll find a link to a body mass index calculator.

Make sure you stop eating when you are full. Make sure junk food or sodas is something for a rare treat...not an everyday food staple. Drink a full glass of water before every meal, and eat your vegetables first. Try to avoid fried food and fast food....and furry food. :) Don't let yourself get lazy.

It doesn't necessarily have to be excercise in a gym - just get out and have fun. Try taking up a sport. Doctors recommend that you walk at the very least 30 minutes every day.<br>  <br>  Eat a balanced diet:<br>  Try to eat at least 5 pieces of fruit a day.

7c5ef91121a6c60b6e31b552c31889b0aa	It is common for pigment from inside the eye to come to the surface at the openings where blood vessels or nerves enter or exit the eyes. This will look like a black, blueish, or brownish spot at the "end" of a blood vessel on the white part of the eye. It is especially common in people with dark eye color. It is not a disease and causes no harm to the eyes or vision, although it can be cosmetically bothersome. If this is what it is you won't be able to remove it and should not try.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you do have something in your eye and there is pain, redness, swelling, and or discharge, you really should try to see an eye doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.|`|AA12136927	I'm a dentist.<br>  <br>  I'm going to say exactly what you don't want to hear.

Why in the universe would you want to take your filthy, bacteria-ridden hands or bacteria-ridden objects and touch them to the sclera of your eye which has now been abraded by this foreign object and now more prone to bacterial invasion?<br>  <br>  If it's bothering you, you need to make some phone calls and find an opthalmologist who can see you.<br>  <br>  Better yet, an optometrist can do it for you.

Now that's not the best advice to give someone, but if you don't want to go to the eye doctor, or can't for some reason, that's what I would do but please, do it very carefully. However, before the q-tip, try flushing it and rolling it ever way you can. Good luck!|`|b89a922115c582e4ec4d37a7d7d7166faa	It's best to cry it out.

And asking questions about how to get help is an effort toward change. Since you're asking these questions and are seeking help, you're probably not a  Sociopath. Unlike normal folks, they have little or no insight into their own behavior and absolutely no concern for the hurt and pain of others. They just don't think they have a problem, don't want to change, and completely lack empathy.  They wear a "mask of sanity" in order to navigate through life with the rest of us. And speaking of that, you may want to invest in a fabulous book actually called The Mask of Sanity by Hervey Cleckley. It's a little pricey, but gives the complete A to Z history and profile of the Sociopath as it relates to Narcissism. The book is hugely entertaining, as well. It's available on e-bay.  As for straight psycotherapy without medication: I would never waste my money on it.  I believe it to be one of the biggest, most expensive hoaxes played on the American public over the last 50 years.  Lots of amateurs out there who are ready an willing to take your money. Try prayer, instead. Seek Jesus and read the Bible. And stay far away from " The Purpose Driven Life," also a hoax and a huge waste of money.

Thanks for posting this question.  Steve Irwin made me think about animals in a whole new way. I have a greater respect for animals because of him. I used to watch crocodile hunters alot, but in the last couple of years, I moved on to other interests. I just feel very sad about him dying at such a young age. I'm 55 and I guess it makes me feel lucky I'm still alive.  Steve Irwin had such a fun personality, I always had the feeling that he was a geniune person, and what you saw is what you got. I would laugh so hard watching him. A very cool person! I love you Steve!

Hope this cheers everyone up a bit! Crickey!<br>  Steve Irwin, A Great Aussie Mate<br>  Australia and America has lost a great mate. For the past few years Steve Irwin has been the Aussie Americans knew best. He was your mate. For those of us who were lucky enough to have worked with him promoting Australia, he was our mate. His extraordinary enthusiasm and passion for life, his unequalled devotion to the animal world, his big hearted love for his country and his efforts to get more Americans Down Under made us proud - of him, and of what he so magnificently represented.<br>  <br>  We thank America for taking him to your hearts. By doing that you gave him the power to make his dream of a better understanding of the natural world a reality. You will miss him, and so will we.<br>  <br>  Steve was a great Australian and a great man.<br>  <br>  Donations in memory of Steve can be made at www.wildlifewarriors.org.au .... <br>  From:<br>  <a href="http://www.australia.com/home_us.aust?L=en&C=US" rel="nofollow">http://www.australia.com/home_us.aust?L=...</a><br>  <br>  Australia Zoo and Wildlife Warriors Worldwide are today in mourning for a beloved friend and respected leader. The global response to the loss of Steve Irwin and the public outpouring of empathy we have received has been overwhelming, and a significant comfort to those of us who knew him. This is not just a loss for us, but for a planet full of people who loved him so well, and for the world’s precious wildlife that he laid his life on the line to protect.<br>  <br>  Steve was a true original; he brought energy and passion to everything he did. Whether it was performing groundbreaking crocodile research on board his vessel Croc One, filming wildlife documentaries or simply celebrating his children’s birthdays, Steve didn’t do anything by half. A hard-core Wildlife Warrior and dedicated family man, Steve did for conservation and education what no one had ever done before. He brought wildlife conservation right into people’s living rooms and created a whole new generation of Wildlife Warriors.<br>  <br>  The exceptional life Steve led is a testament to his respect for all creatures great and small, and his passion for wildlife was matched only by his passion for family life.<br>  <br>  We here at Australia Zoo offer our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Irwin family for your condolences and kind words. Many people have expressed a desire to donate to Wildlife Warriors Worldwide in memory of Steve. All donations will be greatly appreciated and applied directly to saving animals in the wild.

Steve Erwin was a great environmentalist and for me, he certainly helped me to become more aware of the animal kingdom and just how fragile our Eco system truly is.  He helped many understand the importance of preservation of our environment and the animals that exist within it.  I personally am deeply saddened by the loss of this great humanitarian and will miss his humerus ways of educating myself and the rest of the world about animals and their importance to all of us.  I am especially sad for his wife and two small children.

The most common is a natural fiber, silk, which undergoes a special manufacturing process to make it adequate for its use in surgery.

Having a higher blood pressure can actually cause a loss of firmer erections by destroying the vessels. Eating foods lower in fat and higher in vitamin content (vegetables, fruit, etc.) can help by making the blood and body more healthy with the possiblity of better erection.

If its the basic tylenol/asprin/ibuprofen kind of stuff then youll usually be okay if you take it in moderation and follow recommendations on the bottle. If you take to much its possible certain medications could really mess up your liver.<br>  <br>  If your talking about opiate narcotic pain medications such as codeine, hydrocodone(vicodin), oxycodone (oxycontin, percocet), hydromorphone(diludid), morphine, fentinol, etc.. then you have a whole lot more to worry about. These medications are highly addictive both physically and mentally. After 2 years of constant use, especially if the person takes more then the recommended dosage things are definetly happening in the body and mind. The body will begin to crave and require the drug because it will have learned that it's supposed to be there. The mind will also be literally re-programmed to depend on and crave the drug as well. It is not uncommon for the person to really believe at this time that they have to have this medication forever to feel normal and function on some level. After 2 years of use tolerence will also sky rocket and a patient will generally need to continue upping the dosage for the same effect until he ends up switching to a even stronger medication alltogether. Not getting the medicine at the proper time, or if theyve run out often causes irritability and tension. Problem today is doctors are to quick to perscribe these types of medications and often don't warn the patient of the addiction potential these types of drugs present. If someone is getting off a perscription pain medication of this type it is very important they be weaned off slowly and under medical supervision so that they are not to uncomfortable. There are many more things going on here and if you'd like to have more information check around the web, youll find tons of useful stuff. Hope all this helps you out somehow, good luck.

The darker your scars appear, older you look and your pretty face turns unkempt due to these circles. Besides the dark circles you may come across other problems like conjunctivitis, swellings and there are many severe problems like lymphoma, cataract, inflammation of iris, etc. There are a few suggestions mentioned for simple eye problems below. Your eyes are the index of your face value. The prettier your eyes look the more speedy attention you may attract from the public. <br>  <br>  <br>  Regular skin care is required to maintain the area surrounding your eyes. Use a gel or a cream and rub it gently around the orbital bone. The orbital bone is the area that falls directly under the eye structure. Be careful not to rub harshly when you rub around the eye area. The harsh rubbing can only lead to more irritation. <br>  <br>  <br>  Apply the cream to the skin and relax for sometime. If you have to put on a facemask, then soak the little cotton pads into the soap water and place it on the eyes when they are closed. Otherwise, you may use them around 2 cucumber slices to make your eyes cooler. In this way you can provide a pleasant feeling to your eyes. And you can get rid of your dark circles around your eyes quickly. Your skin will glow when these circles vanish. <br>  <br>  <br>  Whenever you experience problems like sore eyes due to harmful infrared rays, wind or after using water with chlorine, then rinse your eyes thoroughly with enough distilled water. Mix rose water with about 1-2 tablespoons in distilled water. Give a suitable bath to the eyes.|`|AA11310601	proactive solution for eyes

This prenatal care can help you have a healthy baby. Every state in the United States has a program to help. Programs give medical care, information, advice and other services important for a healthy pregnancy. <br>  To find out about the program in your state: <br>  ·Call 1-800-311-BABY (1-800-311-2229) This toll-free telephone number will connect you to the Health Department in your area code <br>  ·For information in Spanish, call 1-800-504-7081<br>  ·Call or contact your local Health Department. <br>  ·<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptoms-of-pregnancy/PR00102" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/index.cf...</a><br>  <br>  Best site ever for pregnancy!<br>  <br>   Early signs and symptoms of pregnancy: Things you might notice before you start prenatal care<br>  Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues. <br>  Are you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect — or hope — that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.<br>  Tender, swollen breasts or nipples<br>  One of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.<br>  Fatigue<br>  Many women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.<br>  During the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard — pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.<br>  Slight bleeding or cramping<br>  Some women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.<br>  Many women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.<br>  Nausea with or without vomiting<br>  Morning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.<br>  Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors — such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke — can trigger nausea.<br>  Food aversions or cravings<br>  Turning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.<br>  Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.<br>  Frequent urination<br>  Many pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.<br>  Headaches<br>  If you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.<br>  Constipation<br>  Constipation is another common early indication of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes digestion to slow down, so food passes more slowly through the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to constipation.<br>  Mood swings<br>  You're a no-nonsense kind of woman — so what's with this crying over Hallmark commercials? The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Swings in your mood, from bliss to deep gloom, also are common, especially in the first trimester.<br>  Faintness and dizziness<br>  It's common for pregnant women to be lightheaded or dizzy. These sensations usually result from circulatory changes as your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops. Early in pregnancy, faint feelings may also be triggered by low blood sugar.<br>  Raised basal body temperature<br>  Your basal body temperature (BBT) is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature spikes slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your BBT to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean you're pregnant. In fact, BBT stays elevated throughout your pregnancy.<br>  Are you really pregnant?<br>  Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms aren't unique to pregnancy. Some can indicate that you're getting sick or that your period is about to start. And, conversely, you can be pregnant without ever experiencing these symptoms.<br>  Still, if you notice any of the tip-offs on this list, make plans to take a home pregnancy test, especially if you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next. Also take extra good care of yourself. You just might be taking care for two.<br>  <br>  <br>  Our teenwire.com experts get hundreds of e-mails a week asking the same question: "Am I pregnant?" It's a really nerve-racking thought. But before you freak out, take a deep breath and take the following steps.<br>  <br>  Assess the Situation<br>  <br>  Don't panic. Ask yourself if it's actually possible that you could be pregnant. What did you do, sexually speaking?<br>  Pregnancy can happen any time ejaculate ("***") or pre-ejaculate ("pre-***") is spilled inside the vagina or on or near the vulva. Here are some examples of sex play that do NOT cause pregnancy:<br>  Kissing ,masturbation ,body rubbing, oral sex, anal sex.<br>  These are types of outercourse, and they won't cause pregnancy — unless ejaculate or pre-ejaculate comes into contact with the vagina or vulva.<br>  <br>  Did You Get Your Period?<br>  <br>  It isn't possible to have a period and be pregnant. But it is possible to be pregnant and have vaginal bleeding that may seem to be a period — but this is rare.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that while a missed period is a symptom of pregnancy, there are many other reasons why a girl might miss her period — such as stress, illness, or a diet that's too low in fat. Of course, if you've been having unprotected vaginal intercourse and you've missed a period, a pregnancy test may be the wisest choice you can make.<br>  <br>  Take a Pregnancy Test<br>  <br>  If a woman thinks she might be pregnant, the first thing she needs to do is find out for sure, either by going to a health clinic for confidential testing or by taking a home pregnancy test. She can call 1-800-230-PLAN to schedule an appointment for a pregnancy test at a Planned Parenthood health center.<br>  <br>  Home pregnancy tests are available at pharmacies, and they usually cost about $8-15 in the U.S. Pregnancy tests are effective early — as soon as a few days after a missed period. But be sure to follow exactly the directions on the package in order to get an accurate result.<br>  <br>  Women who take home pregnancy tests often go to clinics to have the results confirmed by a health care provider. Also, if the test is positive, and the woman is pregnant, the clinician can offer counseling on the woman's pregnancy options.<br>  <br>  It's All in the Timing<br>  <br>  If you've had unprotected sex within the past five days, there's still hope. Emergency contraception (EC) can reduce the risk of pregnancy after unprotected vaginal intercourse. Emergency contraception pills (ECPs) can reduce the risk of pregnancy if started within 120 hours (five days) of unprotected vaginal intercourse. The sooner they're taken, the better. If started within 72 hours of unprotected sex, they can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75 to 89 percent.<br>  <br>  For more information on emergency contraception, call 1-800-230-PLAN for the Planned Parenthood center nearest you, or 1-888-NOT-2-LATE. You can also ask about emergency contraception at any public or women's health center, or your clinician's office.<br>  <br>  Be Prepared Next Time<br>  <br>  Why go through all that drama again? Besides, partners often find that sex is a lot more comfortable and enjoyable when they aren't worrying about pregnancy. Teens who have vaginal intercourse need to make choices about birth control.

If we let others hurt us and belittle us on regular basis, and we do not confront them soon about it, they will continue to do so because your behavior let  them know it is OK to continue this.  <br>  The most important thing to do it, when you want to confront someone, you have to choose the right time, the right place and in the right mood for both of you.

If you are able to send them e-mail, write them and tell them what is in your thoughts.

You will never know the peace you get by doing this. <br>  For those near you, just tell them face to face or write them a letter and tell how you feel. Be careful for violent individuals.

I  horribly afraid of confrontation, and will avoid it at all costs. However, there are ways to deal. <br>  <br>  You have to take situations one at a time and confront them in that manner. Take your first situation and decide why you are afraid of confrontation in it. Then, find a way that is comfortable for you to confront the situation. Take baby steps. <br>  <br>  For example, I am comfortable writing. If I want to confront someone I may write them a letter letting them know I want to talk to them in person. That way, I have committed to paper, and must keep that committment. Then, I talk to the person. I stay calm and tell them exactly what the disagreement is and go from there ( this part will be very natural, so don't stress about it. Confrontation is the hardest part). Good luck. :)
AA12381247	<a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm</a><br>  <br>  Hi. Welcome to the Q and A part of the site. Here's a chance to get answers to your questions without actually having to ask them out loud. There's also a list of other resources at the end of the section. If you're still thirsting for knowledge, talk with a parent, teacher or other trusted adult.<br>  <br>  * When will I get my first period?<br>  * Good question. Most girls get their first period between the ages of 9 and 16. Most means the majority - not everyone will fall into this category. Anyway, it follows the development of breasts, hips, waist, pubic hair, and a growth spurt. Put those clues together and they usually add up to imminent period alert. In addition, a girl will often weigh at least 100 pounds before menstruation begins. Genetics also plays a role. If possible, find out when your mom got her first period to get an estimate of when yours may arrive.<br>  * What will happen when I get my first period?<br>  * Usually a first period is very light. It will probably be a few spots of bright red blood or a brown sticky stain that shows up on your underpants. If you are out in public and don't have a pad with you, don't panic. Remain calm. This is a time when true female bonding occurs. Hopefully, your mother or other adult relative will be close by and can supply you with a feminine product. If not, try Plan B. Ask a friend or other woman if she has a pad. It's a well-kept secret that every woman at some time in her life has had to ask another woman for a pad. Yes, it's embarrassing, but you can rely on other women to see you through this situation. And in all honesty, first periods were designed really well because it is usually so little that it won't seep through to your outer clothes.<br>  * How long will my period last?<br>  * Everyone is different. It can last between two and seven days. Most girls have it for about five days.<br>  * What should I do when I get my first period?<br>  * In addition to what's covered above, it's a good idea to have feminine products ready for that first period, and to know how to use them. (See the Kotex products section of our site for more information about these products.)<br>  * What if I get my period at school?<br>  * If you have a pad with you, go to the girls' room and put it on. If you don't have one, go to the school nurse, the office, or wherever you can get a pad. How about keeping a pad at school in case of emergency? If you don't need it, maybe one of your friends will and she can return the favor some day soon.<br>  * What if my flow is really heavy and I have to use lots of pads?<br>  * It's probably just a heavy flow, which can happen during a period's first day or two. Some girls normally experience a heavy flow. If you have a prolonged heavy flow, call your doctor.<br>  * Will I have to stop activities such as sports when I have my period?<br>  * No. These days it's hard to use a period as an excuse to get out of gym class. Believe it or not, the more active you are, the less likely you are to have cramps. And, if you're worried about leaking during sports activities, check out the Kotex products section of the website to find out how to help prevent leaks by using a pad or tampon that fits you and your period.<br>  * How often will I get my period?<br>  * Cycles range anywhere between 21 to 45 days. The average is 28 days. At first, it will probably be irregular. The time between when you get it, the length and time you have it, and the amount of flow will all vary. As your body finds its own internal rhythm, your period will settle into a pattern. It can take a year or two. Mark your periods on a calendar to get used to following your cycle.<br>  * Can I go swimming when I have my period?<br>  * Yes, but don't wear a pad. It will swell up like an inflatable raft. If you want to swim, you should wear a tampon. But first, talk it over with your parent or other responsible adult before trying this (the tampon, not the swimming).<br>  <br>  Please see Questions and Answers about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Or, check out Important Information about Toxic Shock Syndrome.<br>  * Can I take a bath when I have my period?<br>  * Yes. In fact, a bath or a shower is really important at this time to keep you clean and to fight off any odors that may occur.<br>  * Will getting my period hurt?<br>  * The actually bleeding part doesn't hurt. The menstrual cramps are uncomfortable but manageable.<br>  * What do cramps feel like?<br>  * You've probably already guessed this, but cramps don't feel good. Cramps are a pain. And they're particularly a pain around the area of the uterus that is below your belly button. Sometimes they lodge in your lower back. Cramps are caused by the uterus contracting. You can get them just before and during your period. Some girls have a few cramps, some have lots, and then there are those who have none. The intensity of the cramps varies, and you may not get them every time you have your period. They can be managed with over the counter pain relief medication. Ask your doctor for more information.<br>  * What is menstruation, anyway?<br>  * This is strictly a biological explanation so hold on. Menstruation is your monthly opportunity to create a baby. When your body first becomes able to produce a child, usually between the ages of 9 and 16, it begins preparation once a month for possible motherhood. This time in your life is known as menarche ("muh-NAE-key"). A tiny egg matures in one of your ovaries, then travels down a fallopian tube toward your uterus. Your uterus, meanwhile, has been preparing for the egg's arrival, and its lining has gotten thick and velvety. If the arriving egg is fertilized by a sperm, your uterus is all set to protect and nourish the developing baby for the next nine months. If the egg doesn't get fertilized - because there is no sperm present, then your uterus has no use for that thick, spongy lining. So it sheds the lining and flushes it out - along with some blood, body fluids, and the disintegrated egg. For 2 to 6 days each month, all this stuff flows out of your body through your vagina as reddish-brown menstrual flow. After the onset of menstruation, you'll usually have a menstrual period about every 28 days (except during pregnancy) although your cycle may vary anywhere from 20 to 35 days. Flash forward about 40 years, when your body enters menopause. Your ovaries stop producing eggs and your periods stop.<br>  * What does it mean if my period is late or irregular?<br>  * Irregular periods for the first couple of years are normal. But, after that, when you've started to menstruate regularly, missing a period may be a sign of pregnancy (if you are sexually active). Other causes of irregularity include a change in diet, increase in exercise or drug use. The best advice is to chat with your health care provider if you're concerned.<br>  * Will other people know I'm having my period?<br>  * When you're having your period, you don't want the world to know. Regular bathing, proper use of pads and/or tampons and loose, comfortable clothes are a good strategy to keep your period from sticking out in a crowd.<br>  * Why do I feel crabby and sad right before my period?<br>  * PMS. Those three little letters pack a punch, don't they? Moodiness, anxiety and depression are all part of premenstrual syndrome's big bag o' tricks. Again, some women don't get PMS and no guy on the planet "gets" PMS. So if you're suffering with headaches, backaches, pimples, nausea and food cravings, call a friend, the kind who will understand, and talk about it. She may have some advice on ways to find relief. Or, visit "lets talk" to chat with other girls who might be going through the same thing.<br>  * What causes PMS and why do I feel so darn fat?<br>  * PMS symptoms are caused by hormonal changes that take place prior to menstruation. As hormone levels even out, PMS symptoms gradually disappear. The emotions and problems that seemed overwhelming suddenly feel manageable. Get to know your cycle and you will know when to head off PMS.<br>  <br>  As for the "fat thing." Here's the skinny. Just before and during your period, your body tends to retain water. This added fluid might make you feel bloated or your breasts feel tender. It's normal to gain a couple pounds during this time of the month - and ditch them when your period is over. If you feel like a water balloon, pull on some loose, comfortable clothing. Don't even think about using a pair of pliers to pull up the zipper on your favorite jeans. It's not worth the discomfort. Avoiding salt immediately before and during your period is also a good idea. Salt increases water retention.<br>  * What if I bleed through my clothes?<br>  * Ick. Ick. Ick. And it has happened to almost every woman. First step is damage control. Tie a sweater or jacket around your waist or untuck your shirt. If that's not an option, have a good friend walk directly behind you on the way to the bathroom. Find the closest tampon or pad. When you get to the bathroom, check to see if you can blot out any noticeable spots. If it's a hopeless situation, take a trip to the nurse's office and see if someone can bring you a change of clothes from home. If you are at work or out shopping, try to call it a day and head home. Soaking your underwear or other clothes in cold water and using a stain remover can usually get out any blood stains. O.k., now an important word about preventing this from ever, ever, ever happening again. Being proactive can keep this from being a worst-day-ever type of situation. In the future, stash an extra pair of underwear in your locker and wear dark clothes on days when you're expecting your period or when your flow is at its heaviest. Plan on changing your feminine product on a regular basis. Don't wait until it's too late because you're busy. Wear the right product for your flow. For more information on the products that are right for you, visit Kotex products. <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.kotex.com/na/talk/teen/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kotex.com/na/talk/teen/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.femininehygiene.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.femininehygiene.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  We hear a lot about the menstrual "cycle," which can make it sound as though it happens like clockwork. And we say that a woman who gets her period every 4 weeks is "regular," as though there's usually something abnormal about women who don't. In fact, most women don't get their periods at exactly the same number of days after the last one.<br>  Let's take a look at what happens when a girl gets her first period (also known as menarche, pronounced: meh-nar-kee). For most girls, this happens between the ages of 9 and 16.<br>  Your menstrual cycle occurs in stages, which doctors often talk about in terms of 28 days. But 28 is just an average figure that doctors use. Women's cycle lengths vary - some have a 24-day cycle, some have a 34-day cycle. The only thing you can usually count on is that if you're not pregnant, nursing, or ill, you will get your period again.<br>  The first day a girl's period comes is Day 1 of her cycle. Around Day 5, her pituitary gland tells the ovaries to start preparing one of the eggs they contain for release. One egg will mature completely, and at the same time the lining of the uterus gets thicker. The lining becomes thick to prepare a nesting place for the fertilized egg in the event that the girl becomes pregnant.<br>  On or about Day 14, the egg breaks loose (this is called ovulation) and makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If the egg hasn't been fertilized by sperm, it will disintegrate. About 2 weeks later, the lining and egg leave a girl's body as her period and the whole thing starts all over again - that's why we use the word cycle.<br>  All this sounds very neat and orderly, but your body may not follow this schedule exactly. It's not unusual, especially in the first 2 years after menarche, to skip periods or to have an irregular menstrual cycle. Illness, rapid weight change, or stress can also make things more unpredictable because the part of the brain that regulates periods is influenced by stuff like this.<br>  Some girls always have irregular periods; others get theirs every 28 days like clockwork. Many are regular most of the time, but occasionally skip a period or get an extra period during times of pressure or stress. In fact, you may notice that when you go on a trip or have a major change in your schedule your period is late.<br>  The length of your periods may also vary - sometimes your period may last 2 days, sometimes 10. That's because the level of hormones your body manufactures can be different from one cycle to the next and this affects the amount and length of bleeding.<br>  So how can you tell when you're about to get your period? If you're not regular, you'll want to pay attention to the clues your body may give you. These include:<br>  ·back cramps or stiffness<br>  ·heavier breasts or breast soreness (this will happen after ovulation and before you get your period)<br>  ·headaches<br>  ·acne breakouts<br>  ·disturbed sleep patterns<br>  ·mood swings<br>  If you're not taking birth control pills, you're not pregnant, and you're not having other symptoms such as stomach pain, then it's very likely that your irregular periods are part of the normal changes that can happen when you're a teen. At some point as you grow, your cycle will probably settle into a recognizable pattern. This should happen by 3 years after your first period.<br>  Some teens may develop irregular periods - or stop having periods altogether - as a result of a hormone imbalance. Disorders of the thyroid gland can cause menstrual irregularities if the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood become too low or too high. Some women have irregular periods because their bodies produce too much androgen, which is a hormone that causes increased muscle mass, facial hair, and deepening of the voice in males and the development of pubic hair and increased height in girls. High amounts of androgen can also cause hair growth on the face, chin, chest, and abdomen, and is sometimes associated with excessive weight gain.<br>  If a girl has one of these problems, or if her periods are irregular for 3 years or more (or for other reasons), the doctor may prescribe hormone pills or other medications that will help her to have regular periods.<br>  In the meantime, if your periods are irregular, try keeping some pads or tampons in your backpack, just so you'll have them handy in case your period comes when you're not expecting it.<br>  It's important to see a doctor if you're sexually active and have missed a period - this could be a sign that you're pregnant. You should also see your doctor if you start having periods that last longer than 7 to 10 days or periods that are accompanied by severe cramping or abdominal pain.<br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/irregular_periods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a><br>  <br>  Irregular periods<br>  by Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP<br>  To begin with, let me reassure you that most irregular periods are benign. Missed periods, too frequent periods, spotting, or bouts of heavy clotting and bleeding are usually caused by an underlying hormonal imbalance that is easily treated.<br>  Most of us have missed a period at one point or another — some with anticipation of a pregnancy, others because of anxiety or tension. At the clinic, we see women who menstruate like clockwork, while others report never having had a regular cycle. One thing is a given, however: shifts in hormonal balance will alter whatever pattern a woman has experienced in the past. Such shifts are especially common in perimenopause.<br>  What is an irregular period?<br>  At the clinic we answer questions all the time about irregular periods. A textbook period happens every 24-29 days, but in truth what is “regular” covers a wide range. Cycles between 23–35 days are very common. A woman may get her period only one to four times a year. Or she might have periods that occur two to three times in a month and involve spotting or extremely heavy flow. Alternatively, she may have heavy episodes of bleeding every two to three months. Irregular periods are simply what is irregular for you.<br>  For the most part, we don’t worry at the clinic about a missed period or two over the course of a year. More variation than that may indicate to us the beginning of perimenopause or a disruption of the natural chain of hormonal events that controls menstruation. A wide variety of factors can be responsible for irregular periods, among them:<br>  ·Significant weight gain or loss<br>  ·Over-exercise<br>  ·Poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates)<br>  ·Smoking<br>  ·Drug use<br>  ·Caffeine<br>  ·Excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone) <br>  ·Eating disorders<br>  ·Increased stress<br>  ·Polycystic ovarian syndrome/estrogen dominance<br>  ·Uterine abnormalities (fibroids/cysts/polyps/endometriosis)<br>  ·Hormonal imbalance related to perimenopause<br>  ·Medications<br>  ·Chemotherapy<br>  ·Recent childbirth, miscarriage, or D&C <br>  ·Breastfeeding <br>  As you can see, there are many different ways a woman can be irregular for as many different reasons, and it can be very confusing when it happens.<br>  Why does being stressed out cause irregular periods?<br>  When we are under stress, regardless of the source (danger, personal relationships, work, environment) our adrenal glands are designed to secrete the hormone cortisol (see our articles on adrenal fatigue). Cortisol has a direct impact on the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA. Eating disorders, dieting, drug use, and reliance on stimulants like caffeine and alcohol are also interpreted by the body as kinds of stress. Poor nutrition seems to physically change the proteins in the brain so they can no longer send the proper signals for normal ovulation.<br>  Am I in menopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  No — irregular periods are generally an indication of hormonal imbalance, not necessarily related to menopause. Strictly speaking, women aren’t considered menopausal until they have gone for one year without a menstrual period.<br>  If you have not had a menstrual period for a full year and then experience bleeding, this is different from irregular periods. We explain this in more detail in our article on post-menopausal bleeding.<br>  By the way, it is a myth that a woman goes into menopause because her body runs out of eggs. If this were true, then women who experienced menarche (the first period in a woman’s life) earlier would enter menopause earlier. In fact, the opposite is true — early menarche is associated with late menopause. In the same vein, women who had more pregnancies and thereby fewer periods, would have menopause later, and that doesn’t happen, either. If you are experiencing increasing irregularity, you may be suffering from hormonal imbalance or entering perimenopause, and should be evaluated by a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Am I in perimenopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  Not necessarily, but irregular periods are one of the most common signals of perimenopause. That’s why it’s best to check in with a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Women entering perimenopause often have irregular periods due to an imbalance of progesterone that upsets their cycle. Because progesterone regulates the amount and length of bleeding, periods can last longer and be accompanied by very heavy bleeding (also called menorrhagia or hypermenorrhagia). However, shorter or spottier periods can also indicate perimenopause. Click here to learn more about irregular periods in perimenopause.<br>  What does it mean if I miss a period or two?<br>  The most common type of irregular period we see at the clinic is anovulation, or a cycle in which a woman does not ovulate (i.e., does not release an egg). This is frequently the cause of a missed period (an anovulatory cycle) and is considered normal if it occurs only once or twice a year. Clotting is also considered normal if it is cyclic.<br>  Sporadic episodes of poor diet, high stress, emotional trauma, illness, or strenuous physical exercise are the usual suspects behind occasional anovulatory cycles. Sometimes something as simple as a family holiday or a week with the in-laws will play havoc with a menstrual cycle. Monthly periods are quite susceptible to dips and spikes in our emotions and our health. For the most part, once our lives return to normal, so do our periods.<br>  On the other hand, a woman will sometimes skip her period for a few months and then start a heavy period that lasts for days or even weeks. This can be a sign that a woman is entering perimenopause (see above).<br>  More and more we are seeing patients of all ages who come in to the clinic with irregular periods due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), an easily recognizable and treatable condition that frequently occurs with insulin resistance. With PCOS, the ovaries produce a quantity of follicles that generate high levels of estrogen but never release an egg. The excessive estrogen stimulates the uterine lining to thicken to a point where it must slough off. Women with this condition are not having what are considered “real” menstrual periods because they do not regularly ovulate. For more information, we recommend you start with our article on insulin resistance, where you will find other helpful links about this topic.<br>  What if I’m just spotting or not getting a period at all?<br>  We’ve all heard stories from friends who’ve suddenly lost a lot of weight or begun a strenuous exercise regimen, then stopped getting their period. Anorexic women or those who exercise two to three hours a day can find their menstrual cycles diminish or stop due to a decrease in body fat. These women have low estrogen and are not ovulating. This is called stress-type hypothalamic amenorrhea, and it occurs when poor nutrition and stress alter the brain’s chemistry and hormone pathways. The brain can’t trigger the right hormones for follicle development, which make the necessary estrogens. Women with this irregularity tend to be at higher risk for bone loss (osteoporosis) and other degenerative conditions and should be evaluated. Click here for more information about amenorrhea.<br>  Why does my period come twice a month?<br>  In addition to missed periods, we also see women who get more than one period in the span of a month. The causes for this are relatively unknown, but stress and lifestyle seem once again to play a major role. Ingesting medication or other substances that disrupt the luteal phase may be a factor, as well.<br>  I bleed really heavily when I get my period. What does this mean?<br>  Low progesterone, PCOS, or another form of hormonal imbalance may be the culprit. If a woman has two or more successive months of heavy bleeding, a check-up is called for. <br>  Any kind of heavy bleeding can contribute to anemia. When a patient has anemia, we try to stem the heavy menstrual flow and prescribe an iron supplement. Depending on the severity of the situation we may choose from a range of progesterone therapy options along with diet and exercise modifications to help rebalance the hormonal equation. Bioidentical over-the counter, compounded, or prescription formulations are often adequate. A more serious scenario may call for a synthetic progestin such as Aygestin or Provera to bring the bleeding back under control. We will also often suggest acupuncture for relief. Click here for more information about irregular periods in perimenopause.<br>  What can I do about my irregular periods?<br>  The first step is to talk to a healthcare practitioner if you are experiencing any of the symptoms described above. It’s a good idea to do the following:<br>  ·Have a complete physical, including evaluations of thyroid function and blood pressure. Also, a complete blood count (CBC) test is quite important for the diagnosis of anemia.<br>  <br>  ·A pelvic exam is critical to rule out any uterine abnormality, a cervical polyp or fibroid, or a uterine infection. These are less common causes but should be considered. Often an ultrasound will be required to evaluate the uterus, the ovaries and the fallopian tubes. Ultrasound of the uterus is useful and painless — you may already be familiar with this technique from pregnancy. If infection is a concern, antibiotics will be prescribed.<br>  <br>  ·If you are trying to become pregnant, consult with a fertility specialist or a qualified ob/gyn practitioner for further testing.<br>  What is the treatment for irregular periods?<br>  Most of the time, simply decreasing our stress, improving nutrition and adding adequate nutritional supplements can provide a natural way to restore regular menstrual cycles. These steps alone give the body a much needed boost and will support the natural hormonal balance and monthly cycles we are meant to enjoy… and appreciate!<br>  If the issue stems from an anovulatory or perimenopausal condition, a doctor may prescribe birth control pills or progesterone to normalize the cycle. This is often successful. For most patients, we’ve seen a big improvement when positive steps are made to change their lifestyle, including:<br>  ·healthy dietary modifications<br>  <br>  ·supplementing nutritional gaps with a good multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, and fish oil<br>  <br>  ·decreasing intake of refined carbohydrates<br>  <br>  ·moderating your exercise (this may require increasing or decreasing your current level of exercise)<br>  <br>  ·stress relief through exercise or other relaxation techniques<br>  <br>  ·reprioritizing one’s commitments<br>  <br>  For the majority of women who make these changes, a normal menstrual cycle returns without a hitch. In short, we think that most irregular periods are usually nothing to worry about and can be successfully addressed with straightforward, practical measures available to every woman.<br>  <a href="http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation/irregularperiods.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation...</a><br>  Missed or Irregular Periods <br>  <br>  Topic Overview <br>  <br>  <br>  Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual periods each year. You may be different: You may have more or fewer. Missed or irregular periods must be looked at in terms of what is normal for you.<br>  Periods are often irregular during the first few years after menstruation starts. It may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance.<br>  Menstrual periods also may be very irregular at the other end of the menstrual years. Many women realize that they are approaching perimenopause and menopause when their otherwise regular periods become irregular. Menopause occurs when it has been 12 months since you have had a menstrual period.<br>  Pregnancy is the most common cause of a missed period. If you might be pregnant, treat yourself as though you are pregnant until you know for sure. Use a home pregnancy test as the first step to finding out whether you are pregnant.<br>  If you are not pregnant, other causes of missed or irregular periods include:<br>  ·Excessive weight loss or gain. Although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems. <br>  ·Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia. For more information, see the topic Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa.<br>  ·Increased exercise. Missed periods are common in endurance athletes.<br>  ·Extreme emotional stress.<br>  ·Travel.<br>  ·Medications, such as hormonal birth control methods, which may cause lighter, less frequent, more frequent, or skipped periods.<br>  ·Hormonal abnormalities, which cause fluctuating levels of the hormones needed to support menstruation.<br>  ·Illegal drug use.<br>  ·Problems with the pelvic organs , such as imperforate hymen, polycystic ovary syndrome, or Asherman's syndrome.<br>  ·Breast-feeding. Many women do not resume regular periods until they have completed breast-feeding.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/hw96700.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_condition...</a>|`|AA11689215	I had that.

bhnPUzypaa	Shaving rash don't worry, i think just about every girl that shaves down there gets it, regardless of the razor, i have a venus divine too and i still get it. If its not shaving rash then its ingrown hairs. I think the best thing for this is to either try waxing (ouch) or don't shave against the hair which you obviously don't get such a close shave! Also moisturize every time you shave this will help reduce the rash. <br>  <br>  P.s people say use a brand new sharp razor..its total bullsh*t from personal experiences i end up worse off!<br>  <br>  How this helps!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|ixmaM395aa	Ok well shaving downstairs is a big no no!! I know it's painful but waxing is the best form of hair removal for our lady bits. <br>  <br>  The red bumps are caused by the hair trying to push back through the follicle. Unless you maintain that area really well with exfoliating and moisturizing between shaves/waxes the hair can actually become ingrown and start to grow back underneath the skin. Often the little buggers will push their way through, but sometimes not. And this is not fun because it you don't break the follicle open and let the hair our straight away the area can become infected. <br>  <br>  So if you MUST shave down there, the day after you shave gently exfoliate just with an exfoliating mit and after your shower apply a scent free lotion to keep the skin from drying up.|`|JWNzoksmaa	get vitamin E oil/lotion.  that'll help..or you could just wax.

DpMnmrK8aa	I was diagnosed with depression from the age of 11+ if that helps. getting over it at the age of 16 x<br>  <br>  Do you think you have depression? Want to talk?

Depression affects everyone at one point in their life or another. You are not alone when I was thirteen I was very depressed but it isn't impossible to get through it, you just can't let it consume you.|`|s7jZEE6oaa	Yeah, Im 13.<br>  I dont like to think about it as depression. But i do stick to the names of emo and goth. I do not cut, but alot of people just refer to me as it because i like the stlyes of both. If you do have depression, i suggest writing poetry. Thats what i tend to do and it helps me get out alot of feelings.

Neither a child nor an adult, but something in the middle and with often little control of your life it is often very frustrating.<br>  <br>  Do try going to your parents for help and advice, even though at times they will seem to be at the root of many of your issues.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Humbug is just being extreme.  I am not thirteen, any more, I'm fourteen now, and not depressed right now. But when I was thirteen last year, I had horrible OCD, and over that summer, I was extremely depressed by the intrusive thoughts I had.  Most teens do have the blues from time to time, but for some people at this age, they do have an unusually hard time emotionally and can be diagnosed clinically or need therapy and possibly medication.  For me, it was the medication that did the trick.  I'm fourteen now, and not depressed any longer.  You're not alone, and maybe you can get the help you need and overcome yours too.

zAkeKg5Qaa	I think you should focus on eating a healthier diet. Note: I am not saying go on a diet. If you start eating healthier, you may lose some weight, but you will provide a healthier body to nurture your baby. If you keep it up, you will find that you lose weight, you won't put on a lot weight while pregnant, and your body will recover faster. Also, a little cardio is also a healthy thing. Don't kill yourself, just 15 minutes a day of an elevated heart rate in the morning is fine!|`|AHEFXgE7aa	You can do it, but you will be stressed out.

ixmaM395aa	Put down the razor! Never ever shave around that area, the skin is so sensitive. <br>  <br>  Firstly, if they're ingrown you need to do something about breaking them through the hair follicle. Use an ingrown hair cream that will loosen the follicle and make the area more moisturized. When the buggers come through pluck them with tweezers. And just keep doing this as they grow back. The idea is to keep the area well moisturized so that the hair does not grow back under the skin.|`|bhnPUzypaa	Pluck it out, don't worry a lot of us get it.

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	I do, I just write down whatever comes to mind. Sometimes to-do lists, sometimes ideas for my work. My mood, venting, happy thoughts, how much I love my husband, accomplishments I want to remember. Sometimes I'll do a small drawing instead of write. Sometimes I write entire pages about how wonderful I am- that always puts me in a good mood.. listing my best qualities. I prefer to do that over ranting about negative things. Sometimes I acknowledge myself for 5 good things I did for the day by writing... "Today I acknowledge myself for".....and I'll think of things like "cleaned the bathtub. Cooked a nice dinner. Ate a healthy breakfast."  If you're depressed, you should try that- it really makes you stop and take note of good things about yourself.|`|2f63ea8e4cd8d1dfde931d369787149caa	Yeah. Some say it helps to write it down. I say maybe it does, but you don't really want anyone to come and read your thoughts. What I would do is write my thoughts down, see if it helps, then throw it away, burn it or something. I think a hobby would be most helpful instead of writing about it, you'll forget about it eventually.|`|23972a8309dd0a8cac95c3d066048b31aa	i keep a journal, i write down things like major events like dances or big dinners, or when im bored.  I think it helps so that i remember details.  i dont write down stuff that i dont want to remember. like big fights though im sure it would make you feel better.|`|896cbf64959d0325c89958f8177c7260aa	I've been keeping a journal for 2 years, I keep it password protected on my computer.  It's awesome to read it and know that my thoughts and feelings are consistent.  I write about whatever is on my mind or what might be troubling me.  Try it.|`|AA10784641	It Absolutly helps you. First of all, it is theraputic. When you do the action of writing, you are releasing stress and anxiety. Also it is good to monitor your feelings on paper. That way if you are say, feeling really sad and you look in your journal and you notice that you have been feeling sad for most of the past couple months, you know you are not imaging things. You then realize that you may be clinically depressed. It is a good way to measure your feelings.|`|fe53dcc8e9ff4b8d4153869a09c84c91aa	I have a live journal, and it's sometimes a great way to get stuff off your chest, or just remind yourself of what you got up to that week.  I write about silly things I saw or did, reminders to myself of things I need to do.  Anything really!|`|3efbcfb73054028cc3a0ddbeff9545e7aa	Yes I love to keep a journal. It helps me express or let out my feeling w/o ripping anyones head off. I also love it b/c no matter what,  u don't have to worry about ur secret being exposed as long as you hide it in a good place! ;) Also, it's fun to look back at it and be reminded of ur childhood and how you were feeling then.  I write about my current crushes, friend problems or just what happened that day! Sometimes it's more exciting than others, but what does that matter! Journal like the wind girl! (ps. sorry if ur a guy!) lol Hope that helped!|`|AA10600520	I have always kept a journal. I am 20 and still keep one. Its ok to keep a journal it gives you a chance to write down what you are feeling. When you get older you will look back at the journal and it will give you memories. I even keep a journal of what me and my boyfriend does and how long we have been together. I also right down what he gets me on certain occasions|`|a5d3862c7d8a5036294b82a090ee13fcaa	Yup I keep a journal, I have done so since I was a little girl. I write my day to day activities, ups and down in my life. Boyfriends troubles. Pretty much anything that is going on. A journal is a secret place where you write any and everything. Things that no one knows but you. Things you dont want others to know but you need to vent. For me it helps a ton when I am for instance mad at someone and I just want to cool down before going to them and discussing it, I write it down so that when I talk to them I have a clear mind, and I dont say things that I really dont mean in the heat of the moment. However with a journal comes much information so hide it safely in a place where no one else will find it and read it.
8ec3c7fd5ff0211c406ee0b503786af4aa	Unfortunately and shamefully, I did do drugs in my past. My drug of choice was Cocaine. I regret it, and I am ashamed. It makes you turn into a completely different person. A person who steals, even from your loved ones! Makes you more aggressive and unreasonable, foolish acting, you lie,  you sneak and hide, you jeapordize your relationship with others, do things that you never thought you would do, you become unbelieveably selfish, your health is effected, etc...I know! And let me tell you it's not worth it! Not worth it at all. So if you've never done drugs...do you and your loved ones a favor and don't start. You will regret it. And if you're currently going through problems with drugs, seek help, and turn to God. Take care and God bless.<br>  <br>  Jesus loves you.|`|AA10326530	None and never, hopefully will never.|`|8113aba4e40719adfba06b19643466aeaa	nope...me and all of my friends and as far as i know of everyone i/k are completely clean.

Mine are mostly crime stories, although I do write other stuff too.|`|uD8aC42eaa	No, you're fine.  Your stories are you just expressing another side of yourself and there's nothing wrong with that.  As long as your real life doesn't start to resemble your stories (in a bad way, if they were about crimes or something bad) you're fine, they're just an escape.  Its gotta feel nice to think that your 'dark side' is fun, playful, and cute!|`|BAJgK3xoaa	No, it means that that adult still can connect with the child with in, and should try to publish the stories he/she is writing.|`|RixAK2mPaa	only if writing becomes more important than work and family is it a problem.

Who wants to be serious all the time.|`|sX2oWidkaa	There's a difference between being childlike and childish. <br>  <br>  To me, being mature means you are responsible and you have a good sense of right and wrong. <br>  <br>  Watching cartoon movies and drawing rainbows at the age of 24 most likely isn't having detrimental affects on anyone, whereas throwing a temper tantrum when you're not getting your way can unsettle those around you and is just out of control, all for an issue that doesn't justify any of it (this is when you need to grow up).
AA12302661	Bipolar disorder (previously known as Manic Depression) is a psychiatric diagnostic category describing a class of mood disorders in which the person experiences clinical depression and/or mania, hypomania, and/or mixed states. The disorder can cause great distress among those afflicted and those living with them. Bipolar disorder can be a disabling condition, with a higher-than-average risk of death through suicide.<br>  <br>  The difference between bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder (also called major depression) is that bipolar disorder involves both elevated and depressive mood states. The duration and intensity of mood states varies widely among people with the illness. Fluctuating from one mood state to the next is called "cycling". Mood swings can cause impairment or improved functioning depending on their direction (up or down) and severity (mild to severe). There can be changes in one's energy level, sleep pattern, activity level, social rhythms and cognitive functioning. Some people may have difficulty functioning during these times.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is often a life-long condition that must be carefully managed. Because there is so much variation in severity and nature of mood problems, it is increasingly being called bipolar spectrum disorder. The spectrum concept refers to subtypes of bipolar disorder or a continuum of mood problems, that can include sub-syndromal (below the symptom threshold for categorical diagnosis) symptoms.

Bi-polar is a mood disorder where you have drastic highs and drastic lows.  It is different from depression because of the manic(high) stages.  People sometimes can stay up for days duing this stage......they clean vigoursly (sp) and can take some serious risks because of the state of mind they are in.  Sometimes they seem overly adventorous or spontanious......and in there lows they become the opposite.  Varying between Types of Bi-polar is the time period between episodes.  Some people can have multiple full cycles within one day and some others weeks.  I hop this helps a little bit.....There are also many drugs used to treat this disorder such as, but not limited to...Lithium and Depakote.|`|1df0ad311fbe59f9d01e90f00f853835aa	I'm one..............all I know is nobody really knows whar causes it.

The disorder can cause great distress among those afflicted and those living with them. Bipolar disorder can be a disabling condition, with a higher-than-average risk of death through suicide.<br>  <br>  The difference between bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder (also called major depression) is that bipolar disorder involves both elevated and depressive mood states. The duration and intensity of mood states varies widely among people with the illness. Fluctuating from one mood state to the next is called "cycling". Mood swings can cause impairment or improved functioning depending on their direction (up or down) and severity (mild to severe). There can be changes in one's energy level, sleep pattern, activity level, social rhythms and cognitive functioning. Some people may have difficulty functioning during these times.<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is often a life-long condition that must be carefully managed. Because there is so much variation in severity and nature of mood problems, it is increasingly being called bipolar spectrum disorder. The spectrum concept refers to subtypes of bipolar disorder or a continuum of mood problems, that can include sub-syndromal (below the symptom threshold for categorical diagnosis) symptoms.

But, bipolar to me(I am a person who suffers from bipolar), is like having your moods on a rollercoaster ride.  I have been in such a high state that nothing bothers me nor can I sit still for one minute. Whenever you are on a manic high, your mind is just racing faster than you could ever imagine. You are talking 100 miles a minute and really not making a bit of sense to anyone but yourself.  Then you have your days, that you are so depressed that killing yourself makes so much sense to you. You may lay in bed for days, not shower for days, or just cry for no reason at all.

This is a chemical imbalance in the brain that makes it almost impossible for the individual to control their emotions. To make matters worst they cycle between clinical depression and Mania. Now almost everyone knows what depression is Mania is a drastically out of whack good mood. People think they can fly or they are extremely happy. They tend to be full of energy and unable to understand the consequences of their behavior. Sometimes during the depression they become extremely moody or even angry lashing out at everyone around them. Medication and therapy are the most effective way of treating this disorder. If you have to pick just one, medication is the way to go. The biggest problem is that people think they are better because the medication has helped them and they stop taking it, then they go right back to the way they were. This medication is most likely going to have to be taken for life.

They used to think it was, but they have recently found out that maniac depression is severely depression.  Bipolar people get depressed but not to the point were they become paranoid and want to kill themselves or others like maniac depressive people do.  <br>  <br>  Bipolar is still being examined as there are many things unanswered,.  When you have bipolar the serotonin in your brain is low and it is the thing that regulates your emotions.  At the same time they recently discovered that the nerves in a bipolar patients brain have trouble sending its "messages" in a healthy way.  It is like the connection gets broken or interrupted and suddenly a new train of thought is inacted.  You'll notice this if you speak to someone who has the disease it's like their brain is jumping from topic to topic it is esp. noticable if they are highly emotional at the time.  <br>  <br>  It is treated with several drugs the most severe being Lithuim and shock treatment therapy.  It has recently been discovered that it appears to be genetic and skips every othe generation meaning if your parent has it, you won't, but your offspring might.  The most important thing that someone with bipolar can do is take their medication regularly and not self medicate in any way and no recreational usage of drugs or alcohol, because it messes with the balance the Lithium provides.  If there is someone in your life who has this be very supportive of them and try to help them through the hard times.  <br>  <br>  Bipolar comes in two forms type1 the less severe is mood swings that are mild, that can be affective to those around those who have it due to their actions and type II where the mood swings have escalated to the point that without medication the bipolar patient becomes violent and may require hospitalization.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and i hope I provided some info for you to think about.

AA11747128	Eating & Drinking<br>  The active ingredients in cannabis, being fat and alcohol soluble, can be extracted and added to foodstuff entering the system through the digestive tract rather than through the lungs. This type of consumption of marijuana tends to be both slower and more efficient than smoking it. Further the noxious effects of consuming heated smoke are completely eliminated. For this reason, ingestion is the favored method of marijuana consumption by many people. <br>  <br>  Eating<br>  Marijuana must be heated before being consumed to activate the cannabanoids so one cannot simply eat raw grass. The traditional method of eating it is to cook it in a brownie, especially when it is in the form of hashish, though it can be used in any number of things. The recommended method of eating marijuana is to saute it in butter or margarine over medium heat, then to strain the remaining solids out and use the butter to cook with. One can use this marijuana butter to make brownies, cook vegetables, or however else one might use butter to cook with, one can even spread it on a slice of bread. Many people will mix the the residual solids in with whatever they are cooking in hopes of making use of whatever cannabinoids might still be in them, but this is not generally valuable. A typical ratio for making the marijuana butter is one stick of butter to one eight of an ounce of marijuana, and heated for fifteen to twenty minutes. <br>  <br>  Drinking<br>  One may extract the active ingredients from marijuana using alcohol and then use this tincture to make a potent drink. The highest proof alcohol available should be used, preferably 190 proof grain alcohol, since the water in the alcohol will dissolve other chemicals in the marijuana that one wishes to avoid. Some suggest soaking the grass in warm water for a period to remove those chemicals but that presents a whole host of other and is not really recommended. One may simply place the marijuana into a bottle of grain alcohol and let the canabanoids leach out, but this takes 2-3 weeks of time. A faster method is to heat the alcohol to sub-boiling and stir in the marijuana. Great deal of care should be taken if this method is chosen as the alcohol is highly flammable. The resulting tincture, often called "Green Dragon", is a light to emerald green liquid, which can be drunk straight, but this is not recommended. Highly lauded is a drink of 3 parts lemon lime soda, 1 part green dragon and a dollop of honey served over ice.|`|7d3c06caf309f84a08d541b3076cc8a3aa	Don't eat it,you will get an over dose of it and it can do damage to your heart .If you can't get a buzz off a couple tokes,leave it alone,something wrong with you .A couple or three tokes should give you a good buzz if its good stuff.You want have to smoke it all day like cigarettes.Just go light on it,try not to get hooked on it and send the rest to me"LOL".|`|b383c84c17690f514bda8c21e0f852e0aa	eating it gives you a longer high, but you need a LOT more marijuana to feel anything.

1fbaeb83fd31d5b1850019e7d5c7f033aa	Fumei durante 35 anos da minha vida e confesso que foi um dos maiores prazeres que tive, fascinado com todo o glamour do mundo dos fumantes, a come?ar pelos acessórios para fumantes tais como isqueiros Du Pont, Zippo e Ronson, por exemplo, isso sem se falar na grande companhia que o cigarro me fazia quando estava só ou mesmo estando ao piano, acompanhado de um bom wisky ou ainda participando nos meus projetos arquitet?nicos (alguns até queimaram parcialmente meus vegetais, por descuido meu), nas festas, nos momentos de tristeza e tens?o e, cá entre nós, tem coisa melhor quer uma boa baforada acompanhada de um licor após o jantar? Pois é, por mim, jamais deixaria esta "jóia" e, além do mais, meus exames ergométricos e radiográficos, nunca sequer sugeriram que eu tivesse alguma doen?a causada pelo fumo - pulm?es limpos, de n?o fumante - , era o que me diziam os médicos. Pois bem, num belo dia comecei a me sentir mal, sentia um cansa?o diferente, uma fadiga muito estranha, acompanhada de uma sensa??o de "vou desligar". Corri ao meu médico e este examinou-me todo e solicitou tudo que era exame , afinal já estava com 49 anos e, para nossa surpresa, nenhum exame acusou qualquer resultado que insinuasse, ainda que de leve, haver alguma doen?a. Ele me questionou se eu estava estressado ou sob press?o de qualquer tipo; pasme, ao contrário, eu estava vivendo numa fase muito tranquila e feliz. Diante dos fatos e resultados, ele ficou embasbacado, mas gra?as a Deus e à enorme experiência profissional deste doutor, me disse: - "Olha, só por desencargo de consciência, vou solicitar uma prova de fun??o pulmonar, você pode ir ao 9oandar deste mesmo edifício e, aguardarei aqui no consultório o resultado". Subi, entreguei a requisi??o à recepcionista e aguardei o médico. Quando este chegou, conduziu-me à sala de de procedimento dos exames. Após a conclus?o, aguardava o resultado e eis que o médico retorna e me diz:-"Desculpe, deve ter havido algum problema com o equipamento e teremos que refazer os exames, se o senhor n?o se importa". é claro que intui que alguma coisa muito estranha estava acontecendo. Após a repeti??o do exame, ele pediu que aguardasse e, para minha surpresa, mandou chamar no 4o andar o meu médico e, juntos, me deram a notícia: - Você está muito doente e, o que é pior, totalmente assintomático, isto é, n?o apresenta os sintomas clássicos de quem tem esta doen?a, a come?ar pela tosse, pigarro constante, inflama??es, etc e cumpre-nos informá-lo que o seu pulm?o direito produz menos de 35% do oxigênio que o seu organismo necessita e o seu pulm?o esquerdo menos de 25%, em outras palavras, eu estava morrendo por asfixia dos órg?os e tecidos do meu corpo. Assim que passou o susto, me invadiu um sentimento que se traduzia numa mistura de impotência e ódio ao mesmo tempo. Me senti traído, vendido e usado pelo cigarro. Descemos ao consultório do meu médico e, ele me parecia chocado, mais do que eu, afinal era meu médico e amigo desde os 17 anos e nunca desconfiou de nada. Aí eu perguntei, isso é muito ruim ? Ele me informou que se eu parasse de fumar, o mal causado aos meus pulm?es n?o progrediria, mas também n?o regridiria, a vantagem era que sem fumar eu me sentiria melhor, isto é, teria uma qualidade de vida próxima ao razoável durante anos, porém se eu continuasse a fumar, certamente abreviaria minha vida. Fiz um balan?o, pesei o "ganha/perde" e, neste mesmo dia, fumei meu último cigarro e desde ent?o, passaram-se 8 anos e, o mais importante de tudo foi a ajuda de Deus a quem "pedi com toda a fé que me tirasse a vontade de fumar". Tenho certeza absoluta que Ele ouviu. Esta é a maior dica. Antes que eu me esque?a, de lá para cá n?o engordei nenhuma grama.|`|11e801be07931790b5ba7a0ee49bba24aa	Que pare de pensar em si mesmo e pense em quem o ama|`|33f8daa8da0977e75217dd66067493edaa	Amigo Gilnearte.<br>  Vai ate um hospital e pe?a para ver o fim de um fumante e você vai ver como o fim é triste.<br>  Um abra?o e boa sorte na sua visita.<br>  Desde ja um abra?o fuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii|`|34ce2d1b29b7c30662d119683522443daa	Caro amigo, já fui fumante e sei como é difícil se livrar do vício.

A partir daí, a maioria das pessoas irá necessitar de auxílio profissional. As op??es disponíveis s?o:<br>  <br>  1) Medicamentos (com a Bupropiona) que atuam reduzindo o estado de ansiedade que se instala com a interrup??o do uso de cigarros; pode ser usado apenas sob prescri??o e acompanhamento médico. <br>  <br>  2) Reposi??o de nicotina: através de gomas de mascar ou adesivos cutaneos; pode ser usada em conjunto com o medicamento acima citado.<br>  <br>  3) Mudan?a (temporária) de hábitos associados ao uso do cigarro. Exemplos: evitar o cafezinho no corredor, no intervalo do trabalho, em que os amigos batem papo e fumam; evitar o encontro no bar após o expediente em uma mesa de fumantes etc. Cada um irá identificar as situa??es de risco para recidiva.<br>  <br>  4) Caso caia em tenta??o após alguns dias e fume um cigarro, n?o considere isso como indica??o de que "n?o tem mesmo jeito", voltando a fumar desbragadamente. Nada disso: deu uma escorregadela, é uma grande pena, mas retome seus propósitos imediatamente e reforce sua estratégia. Caso esteja ainda ansioso, a despeito do medicamento que o médico receitou, converse com ele sobre a possibilidade de ajuste da dose ou acréscimo de outro medicamento, temporariamente.<br>  <br>  E boa sorte!|`|e470f00e0cf5fd7f78b1580623cd9fe9aa	Olhe eu já dei esta resposta aqui; fumei 20 anos mais o que me ajudou a deixar este vicio foi toda vez que me dava vontade de fumar eu comia um peda?o de alguma fruta e pela gra?a de Deus já faz oito anos e eu n?o sinto nenhuma vontade de fumar, agora é só perseveran?a.|`|lBBxW7FSaa	Um Amigo meu e colega de servi?o, fumante inveterado,exagerado conseguiu parar de fumar com um método muito bom e de custo n?o muito caro.<br>  Foi a uma farmácia explicou que desejava parar de fumar e ent?o o balconista vendeu-lhe uns adesivos graduados para uma escala de redu??o.<br>  Na primeira semana meu Amigo colocava na pele geralmente debaixo da manga da camisa curta, um adesivo de maior quantidade de nicotina.<br>  Na semana seguinte outro de menor quantidade de nicotina e assim sucessivamente até que em dois meses parou de fumar totalmente.<br>  O adesivo libera nicotina na pele que a absorve e a boca n?o pede o cigarro, ou se pede consegue a cada dia ir diminuindo até parar. é bater e valer.<br>  Hoje este meu amigo e colega tem ódio de cigarros e indica este método para outros que também obtiveram sucesso.<br>  Pode usar este método que funciona mesmo.

678oGIupaa	hi i am a dental nurse and its sound like you do have a cavity.<br>  <br>  private fillings can vary in cost depending on the practice and the actual size of filling and the tooth. if you have your fillings on the NHS it will be a set price of ￡44.60 as fillings fall in band category 2, and it doesn't matter how many fillings you need the price is that. you can have them done on the NHS and then save to have them changed to white fillings when you have the money. if the cavity's are on your front 8 and lower front 8 teeth they are usually white fillings on the NHS anyway.|`|JZUn4y6Gaa	It may not be a cavity sometimes your teeth just develop sensitivity sometimes, try Sensodyne toothpaste if you have it in the UK.

It won't hurt to check it out and hopefully this helps.

Qh2rc1DNaa	I know this page includes some things that you are already doing....but the page on the whole has good info......<br>  <br>  <br>  Bad Breath (Halitosis)<br>   <br>    Overview<br>    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<br>    Additional Resources<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Bad Breath (Halitosis)Overview<br>  <br>  Whether you call it bad breath or halitosis, it’s an unpleasant condition that’s cause for embarrassment. Some people with bad breath aren’t even aware there’s a problem. If you’re concerned about bad breath, see your dentist. He or she can help identify the cause and, if it’s due to an oral condition, develop a treatment plan to help eliminate it.<br>  <br>  What you eat affects the air you exhale. Certain foods, such as garlic and onions, contribute to objectionable breath odor. Once the food is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is transferred to the lungs, where it is expelled. Brushing, flossing and mouthwash will only mask the odor temporarily. Odors continue until the body eliminates the food. Dieters may develop unpleasant breath from infrequent eating.<br>  <br>  If you don't brush and floss daily, particles of food remain in the mouth, collecting bacteria, which can cause bad breath. Food that collects between the teeth, on the tongue and around the gums can rot, leaving an unpleasant odor.<br>  <br>  Bad breath can also be caused by dry mouth (xerostomia), which occurs when the flow of saliva decreases. Saliva is necessary to cleanse the mouth and remove particles that may cause odor. Dry mouth may be caused by various medications, salivary gland problems or continuously breathing through the mouth. If you suffer from dry mouth, your dentist may prescribe anartificial saliva, or suggest using sugarless candy and increasing your fluid intake.<br>  <br>  Tobacco products cause bad breath. If you use tobacco, ask your dentist for tips on kicking the habit.<br>  <br>  Bad breath may be the sign of a medical disorder, such as a local infection in the respiratory tract, chronic sinusitis, postnasal drip, chronic bronchitis, diabetes, gastrointestinal disturbance, liver or kidney ailment. If your dentist determines that your mouth is healthy, you may be referred to your family doctor or a specialist to determine the cause of bad breath.<br>  <br>  Maintaining good oral health is essential to reducing bad breath. Schedule regular dental visits for a professional cleaning and checkup. If you think you have constant bad breath, keep a log of the foods you eat and make a list of medications you take. Some medications may play a role in creating mouth odors. Let your dentist know if you've had any surgery or illness since your last appointment.<br>  <br>  Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste to remove food debris and plaque. Brush your tongue, too. Once a day, use floss or an interdental cleaner to clean between teeth.<br>  <br>  Mouthwashes are generally cosmetic and do not have a long-lasting effect on bad breath. If you must constantly use a breath freshener to hide unpleasant mouth odor, see your dentist. If you need extra help in controlling plaque, your dentist may recommend using a special antimicrobial mouth rinse. A fluoride mouth rinse, used along with brushing and flossing, can help prevent tooth decay.|`|wnzK56fiaa	Try pro-biotics or colostrum.|`|C1HtaKqlaa	It depends on the type of smell.

Especially if you're a small dude. Here's what you should do and it'll make you stronger for sure.<br>  <br>  1)Find out your max, meaning find out the maximum amount you can bench press in 1 rep. Always have a spotter.<br>  <br>  2)Once you know your max do this work out. 5 Sets of 5 Reps of 80% of your max 3 times a week. <br>  <br>  It is a hard work out, so you must always have a spotter. Make sure you have one days rest in between each work out. I did this in high school 2 years ago and i was one of the strongest guys at my school.

Honey Dijon mustard <br>  Heat oven to 375. Coat a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Place each chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound out until thin. Place 3 slices of ham and 1 slice of cheese at the top of each breast, and roll starting with the end that has the cheese and ham, bringing the sides in as you roll. Dip each roll in the mustard (I spread mine on), and then dip into bread crumbs. Place on baking sheet and spray each breast with non-stick cooking spray. (Oops I didn't see that and didn't do it). Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. I baked mine for about 45 minutes as I like my chicken on the dry side.

Preheat the oven to 400 F. Spray a 1-qt shallow baking dish with nonstick spray. <br>  <br>  2. Beat the egg and water in a shallow bowl. Combine bread crumbs, parsley, cheese and pepper on a sheet of wax paper. <br>  <br>  3. Dip 1 piece of chicken into the egg mixture. Then dip both sides into the bread crumb mixture, shaking off the excess. Place the chicken in the baking dish. Repeat with remaining pieces of chicken. Discard remaining egg and bread crumb mixture. Bak chicken until golden and cooked through about 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  Serving Size: 1 piece of chicken <br>  Points: 5 <br>  Recommendation: use good quality shredded parm, not cheap or grated stuff. the flavor is much stronger.

Slice the pita across 2 inches from the top to create a pocket. Take this extra piece of pita, open it up, and cut into very tiny pieces. Place pita crumbs in a dish and cover with Egg Beaters; allow crumbs to soak up liquid for a few minutes. Defrost Boca crumbles (about 30 seconds in the microwave should do it; you don't want to heat them) and blot away any excess moisture with a paper towel. Next add onion, salt, garlic, ketchup and Boca crumbles to the egg/pita-crumb mixture. Thoroughly mix the ingredients. Set out a small baking pan lined with wax paper and/or sprayed generously with nonstick spray. Using your hands, form "meat" mixture tightly into 3 balls (it's okay if they appear liquid-y; they will solidify upon cooking). Place balls on the baking dish and cook in the oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat tomato sauce and (if desired) season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Gently open pita pocket and toast to your preference (toasting it at least slightly will help keep it from getting soggy from all that hot sauciness!). When meatballs are ready, remove from oven and carefully coat them in the tomato sauce. Gently fill pita pocket with meatballs and sauce. Dig in!! <br>  <br>  <br>  HG Alternative!

This is the first step in checking it.<br>  <br>  But first, do you have cold intolerance?  What are your nails and hair like?  These are helpful clinical clues as well, not just fatigue and weight gain.<br>  <br>  If your doc checks your TSH and the value is elevated, then you most likely have hypothyroidism.  A free T4 and free T3 test would be confirmatory if they were decreased.  But it is possible to have subclinical hypothyroidism where your TSH level is NOT elevated and your T4 and T3 levels are still low.

But do bare in mind that magnesium supplements are fairly laxative depending on how much you take. You can take up to 60ml of milk of magnesia as an adult dose but if you have loose stools you may want to reduce this and take an alternative such as ginger. <br>  <br>  Milk of magnesia:<br>  <a href="http://www.expresschemist.co.uk/product_2088_phillips--milk-of-magnesia-100ml.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.expresschemist.co.uk/product_...</a><br>  <br>  Further info on ginger:<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Interested-In-a-Ginger-Acid-Reflux-Remedy?&id=780623" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Interested-In-...</a><br>  <br>  You could also chew fennel seeds after meals or drink a small amount of fennel tea.

It is a legal form of it that you can buy at stores and it's natural. So it gives a natural high. I heard it's WAY better for you but I doubt that.<br>  Anyways, don't do ecstasy! It can kill even on the first use.<br>  Some effects of it is jaw jacking or locked jaw, paranoia, increased body temperature, as I said before, huge pupils, makes you stay up for hours, makes you really happy, and makes you want to have sex. If you do have sex on it, you will NEVER have a good orgasm again. It makes it feel good and will never have the same effect. Therefore. Don't ever do it.|`|MCWAWePJaa	Let me tell you what Ecstasy can and will do to you. It killed my 21 year old niece on December 10, 2007 one year ago. It placed her 24 year old sister in jail and rehab. The 21 year old left behind an 11 month old baby boy for her 44 year old mother to raise.  She was placed on a vent for 3 days. She went into Multi- Organ Failure. Her entire system shut down....from to much ecstasy. Please never try this. I have never taken any type of drug or pill that didn't have my name on it from a Dr. I am 42 and proud of it!  My sisters daughters are well...one deceased and one rehabilitating. Our lives are changed forever. Remember...the choices you make now alter the results that follow. Do you want to live a long happy healthy life?  Do you want to be a parent someday? How do you want to be remembered?  Don't temp fate! Don't do it...Please talk with an adult about your choices. It sounds like from reading this question you are not educated at all on drugs.  That "loving" feeling will go away once this pill is out of your system but you can NEVER change death. It is so permanent. think about it...Good luck.|`|wt5cKCAnaa	well ecstasy is another name for thizz and it is very fun it makes sex feel better and u are alot niccer|`|mjLQbGUHaa	about $5 ,same as uptown

And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me.. <br>  <br>  thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411<br>  <br>  EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha<br>  and sleeping is the same rate :)<br>  <br>  excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)<br>  -------<br>  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things.

1aT4rsjraa	The "cervical cancer needle" is a vaccination against the 4 strains of the human papilloma virus which causes about 70% of all forms of cervical cancer.  HPV is a sexually transmitted disease that often goes undetected because it has little to no signs or symptoms.  You can have it for years without knowing.  Men and women can have HPV but only women get cervical cancer for obvious reasons.  Although HPV is an STD, it is extremely common.  Over 6 million new cases of HPV are detected yearly.  <br>  You can get the shot at your doctor's office.  Right now, it is only approved for women between the ages of 9 and 26 so if you are not in that age range, you are not eligible to get it.  <br>  The shot hurts like anything...it feels like molten lava being pushed into your vein.  It's a 3 part shot, the first shot, a month later, a second shot, and 5 months after the second, you get the final dose.  Like I said, it's extraordinarily painful, but I'm sure cervical cancer is even worse.|`|JWNzoksmaa	cervical cancer is cause by HPV or the street name "gential warts" I've never heard of the needle.  maybe your thinking of Guardasil the HPV preventive shot?|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	last girl right ...|`|RFUgLmxyaa	Are you talking about the shot? It is for preventing the sexually transmitted disease Human papillomavirus (HPV) and young women get it. HPV can turn into cervical cancer. Your doctor can give it to you if you are between the ages of 11 and 26. You can read more about it in the link I provided.
uDLHeWgNaa	Not really all that healthy.<br>  <br>  Jelly has sugar in it. Bread has sugar and salt in it and it is better if it is multigrain. Ham is salted. Cheese is dairy and dairy is bad for you.<br>  <br>  Suggestion:<br>  <br>  Sugar free fruit spread instead of jelly, make your own multigrain bread without salt or sugar, avoid all dairy products.|`|PTRxJcC4aa	healthy healthy healthy!!<br>  good job, and remember to drink plenty of water!|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	Do you want the truth, or do you want to hear what you want to hear?<br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are, how tall you are or how much you weigh, so while what you've eaten is theoretically healthy, it might not be healthy enough for you.  <br>  <br>  You should have so many grams of protein a day; eggs, meat, fish, beans.  You should have so much dairy, so many fruits and veggies, so many grains, and so much fat.  It is not healthy to overload on one and totally deny the other, especially if you're a woman.  <br>  <br>  You don't have enough calories there to sustain your life -- it's not like you'll die today, but continuing on this type of diet long term will lead to malnutrition.<br>  <br>  Sugar in your jam and salt in your ham is not the enemy; in fact, having too little salt is a health hazard.   Dairy is NOT bad for you; in fact, there dairy is just as necessary as fat or grains or protein.  <br>  <br>  You can replace white sugar for honey, if you're concerned about sugar.   I did this and lost ten pounds in two weeks, having changed NOTHING else in my diet but that.  And that's AFTER three children.<br>  <br>  I knew this woman who wanted to feed her family healthy foods.  She took all meat out of their diets, all the dairy and all the sugar and just a sprinkle of salt.  They ate plenty of tofu for protein, plenty of vegetables, lots of water, and plenty of whole wheat and multigrain breads.   Her 15 year old son began having fainting spells.  Her 11 year old daughter had continuous cold sores, canker sores, and other mouth problems.  Her 9 year old daughter started having seizures and her five year old had one long, continuous sinus infection.  I mean, I saw these kids every single day and that kid's nose was always oozing green, slimy mucus.   It wasn't until one of her children nearly died that she understood that just because you're "eating healthy" doesn't mean that you're eating healthy enough.<br>  <br>  You can see a nutritionist who can help you outline a good, balanced diet that will achieve whatever weight loss you may be trying to obtain, without making you sick.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Honey, you're too young for a diet like this.  Your body is still growing, and that means that there are going to be certain times that your body goes through what's called a growth spurt, where you grow taller, etc., etc.  If you don't have enough meat on your bones, you won't grow properly.  <br>  <br>  My nine year old weighs 55 pounds.  You are 13 and weigh 86.  Your weight is perfect for your height right now.  In fact, if you were my daughter, I'd like to see an extra ten pounds on you just to make sure that when that growth spurt hits, it's not hampered in any way.  <br>  <br>  Please be careful with diets; they are not good for such a young girl.   You won't stop growing until you're 17 or 18 years old, and unless you're grossly overweight -- which you're not -- you should not be dieting until you are at least 17 or 18 years old.|`|SYccJO3Haa	Hi there - the problem I see with this is that it's basically all carbs. Apart from the small bit of ham and cheese, it's all carbs. (Anything that doesn't come from something with a face is a carb, as a general rule of thumb).<br>  <br>  So, in answer to the question - is it healthy?<br>  1) Without knowing the exact quantities, it doesn't look to have anywhere near enough calories - the energy that you need to live and function well. If you do this for any length of time you'll just slow your metabolism down so that you need less food before you put on weight.<br>  2) There are too many processed foods in there - the granola bar (you'd be better off having 100% porridge oats), bread, strawberry jelly, raspberry vinaigrette. You are always better off eating real food than processed food (so meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, fruit and veg are better)<br>  3) There's not enough variety and sources of all the vitamins and minerals - you'd be deficient in several nutrients eating like this for any length of time.<br>  <br>  Top tips? <br>  1) Eat only real food - as mentioned above meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, fruit, vegetables, whole grains - and little or no processed food.<br>  2) Eat better - don't eat less and you actually need to eat more - have huge salads and vegetable selections to accompany main meals.<br>  <br>  I'm curious as to why you are you eating like this? Are you trying to lose weight - the top tips will help with this too.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  All the best - Zoe|`|8SRjELNBaa	Sounds healthy, but is it enough calories?

Here are some things that have worked for me.<br>  <br>  Admit that you stutter and don't worry about what people think.  Since there is no need to hide that you stutter, that will remove one source of anxiety and tension.<br>  <br>  When you are in a situation where you start to stutter, just work through it no matter what happens.<br>  <br>  Figure out what sounds bother you the most.  Is it an S or a B, for instance?  Then work on either avoiding them or on getting through them.<br>  <br>  Think about the situations that bother you the most.  Maybe they are the ones where you are called on to say something and you can't think of what to say.  When one of these comes up, take a few seconds to think about what to say and then say it.<br>  <br>  Finally, realize that people want you to succeed, they do not want you to fail.  When you start to speak, the listeners really want you to say what you have to say.  They will not mock you or call you names, they will help you.

2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	There is a very good reason for this.  You lose weight in the order it was put on, and this differs from males to females.  Females gain weight first in the thighs/hips, then butt, then stomach, and finally breasts.  So, as you lose weight, you're going take it off in reverse order...breasts first (I know it's depressing!) and then stomach, butt, and thighs.  Stick with it and you'll get back to a good shape, but understand that your breast fat won't come back.

But try to eat healthier foods with less calories.<br>  <br>  You can look up the amount of calories in common food items at Livestrong.com.<br>  <br>  Drinking tea helps detoxinate the body, so that is a good idea. To meet your weight goal, you will probably need to lose 2 pounds a week or SLIGHTLY more, so you hould eat around 1300 calories a day.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, when you exercise, you need to push yourself, so increase whatever you decide to do a little bit each couple of days. Cardio is best for weight loss, so I run everyday, burning 400 calories. If you don't like running, you can do biking, swimming, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Make it serve some practical purpose.

Provided you're doing something else and not -just- exercising.... losing motivation shouldn't be as much of a problem.<br>  <br>  #2. Vodka & Red Bull. Get enough alcohol and caffiene in your system together, and drive / motivation for activity will NOT be a problem... rest assured. Provided you don't do it so much that you become an alcoholic or kill your liver.... its generally a feasible plan.  The last time I dosed myself up on Vodka & Red Bull, I was hyperactive for several hours... ran several miles across london ... across several main roads... and nearly picked a fight with a car. The next morning I didn't have a hang-over, but I'm underweight and I'd burnt through so much of my energy reserves that my body had become weak from it. <br>  It was cold besides....

I am trying to combat my type II diabetes, and it has worked beautifully.<br>  <br>  In case you are unfamiliar with a vegan diet it means no meat, no dairy, no eggs at the least.  I have also cut out all refined grains, junk food, fast food and processed foods.  I only eat sweets and fried foods for VERY special occasions (such as holidays or my  birthday) but this is rare.<br>  <br>  The majority of my diet is whole grains, vegetables and beans/legumes.  I also eat nuts, seeds, some fruit, soy products and some oils (flax seed, olive, canola). <br>  <br>  I should note that I do not need to watch my portion sizes or count calories eating what I do.  I exercise regularly, however.  I'm never hungry (between meals, that is), and with the help of a daily multivitamin and fortified soy milk have no deficiencies.  I'm never bloated, have tons of energy, and my digestive system works...regularly :).  It is a heart-healthy, cholesterol-free, low fat diet.  I once read somewhere that just by switching to a vegan diet, you can expect to lose about 1 pound per week without any exercise at all (can't remember the source, though).  That's 52 pounds in a year.  It's best to read up on it before you do it, though.  You'll have to cook everything yourself, most likely, and be sure to include enough high-calcium and high-protein foods (greens, broccoli, fortified cereal, beans, legumes, soy).  Lots of variety and lots of research will help.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, nobody ever really likes this suggestion even though it's incredibly effective.  I guess it's just too strict for some people.  Watching a few PETA videos had me sold.  It's easy to avoid things once you decide they disgust you.  In any case, it works...but it's not for everyone.|`|513003f5a1fcca24f7e9792abe1da00baa	No need to read voluminous books. Weight reduction can be summed up into four words only:<br>  <br>  EAT LESS, EXERCISE MORE.<br>  _______________________|`|b41c4fd3e752fbe5aa6ec17b182f301faa	I'm gonna have to at least partially disagree with the 'eat less, exercise more' post.  That's not the right in my opinion.  Here's the magic word: CALORIES  To loose weight, you simply have to take in fewer calories than you burn. <br>  <br>  Using one of the websites referenced below, it looks like you're sitting at the around the 2000 cal/day mark to maintain, so taking in 1500 cal/day should be doing the trick, with about a 1 pound a week.  So it doesn't sound like you're eating too badly.<br>  <br>  It would be good if you could find a way to incorporate some exercise in there.  Sometimes just boosting the metabolism a little gets the fire burning and can get you off a plateau.<br>  <br>  And, lastly, get yourself some motivation from like minded & goaled people.  There's a great weight loss forum at "3 Fat Chicks on a Diet" (link below) where people swap tips, tricks and just keep each other motivated.  (I'm on the 30-something's support group and they're just a fab bunch of people.)  Sometimes someone to share in your troubles is all you need to keep you motivated when you're down.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  RXZ|`|1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	How to lose 10 pounds quickly<br>  <br>  You know Christmas is around the corner. Christmas is the season of parties, celebrations, enjoyment and buying new stuff like clothes, gifts and what ever you like. Why not set a goal for yourself to lose 10 pounds in the next few days and it will help you find a better dress for you as you will feel more confident and more comfortable after losing some weight.<br>  <br>  Christmas weight lossIt is a great feeling even after losing very small amount of weight as that motivates us to lose more weight. The very first thing you can do is that calories consumed must be less than the calories burnt. Keep the record of each and every thing what ever you eat. Check out the amount of calories in a food before ordering that. So you have to be very careful about the amount of calories you consume.<br>  <br>  Try to cook your food by yourself and avoid deep fried food. Limit your calories intake to 1000 to 1200 per day. Remove all sugar and starch from your diet.<br>  <br>  So here are some quick tips to lose 10 pounds quickly<br>  <br>  <br>      * Drink lot of water<br>  <br>      * Eat a healthy breakfast<br>  <br>      * Do not eat any thing in between the meals<br>  <br>      * Exercise everyday for 30 minutes at least<br>  <br>  <br>  So go ahead with this and gives yourself a Christmas gift by losing more pounds and look sexier, healthy and more confident.|`|5d0533ba830536f7242b9641ace4fb68aa	I found that cutting sugared drinks (including juice) out of my diet helped me lose 5 lbs and keep it off.  I drink water, coffee, and wine.  In order to replace my cravings for fruit juice or soda, I ate an apple and an orange.  It provided the fiber I needed to lessen hunger pangs and had much less calories and sugar.  <br>  <br>  Also, the South Beach diet is healthy and fairly easy to stick to.  The biggest thing you can do for yourself is AVOID PROCESSED FOODS.  I absolutely hate exercising, obesity runs in my family, and I am slim (an always have been) because I opt for healthier choices.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable, real butter instead of margarine, no canned or boxed foods, I don't avoid carbs but eat a lot of fruits and veggies with my carbs.<br>  <br>  One book that makes a lot of sense to me is Ultrametabolism by Max Hyman, MD.  It basically incorporates all of the good common-sense ideas of the Atkins and South Beach diet into one easy-to-understand book that explains how you can get the most from what you eat and not feel hungry or need to exercise yourself to death.

For some reason, misinformation surrounds masturbation like virtually no other topic. How do you spot a masturbation myth? One simple method is to ask yourself if the statement is also true of sexual intercourse. When you're masturbating, your body only knows it's getting sexually stimulated; it doesn't know by what means. So, for instance, if the question is whether or not masturbation causes acne, think of it this way: If it did, intercourse would also cause acne. In fact, neither masturbation nor intercourse cause acne.<br>  <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes hair to grow on your palms.<br>  FACT:<br>  How many people with hair on their palms have you seen?  <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes hair loss, chronic fatigue, and other problems.<br>  FACT:<br>  Internet scam artists have tried to invent a concept called "overmasturbation," insisting that you have to buy their expensive herbal pills in order to counteract the effect of masturbating more than a couple of times per week. But the pills have absolutely no effect — and masturbating once or twice a day will not make your hair fall out, or cause anything else they claim.<br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation is bad for your eyesight. <br>  FACT:<br>  Masturbation does not affect eyesight. This myth probably originated because boys often start having to wear glasses at about the same age they start masturbating. <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes your penis to stop growing (or) to get bigger. <br>  FACT:<br>  Masturbation has no effect on penis size whatsoever. <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes your testicles to shrink.<br>  FACT:<br>  Absolutely false! It is true that if you're highly aroused, your testicles become engorged with blood and may appear slightly larger and heavier, and that masturbating will make them revert to normal. But they will absolutely not be any smaller than after the last time you masturbated. <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes acne. <br>  FACT:<br>  It doesn't cause acne. Like the eyesight myth, this is a case of two things that happen at the same time, even though one doesn't cause the other. <br>  MYTH:<br>  Masturbation causes sexually transmitted diseases. <br>  FACT:<br>  Hello? "Sexually transmitted" means from one person to another. You can't give yourself a sexually transmitted disease! <br>  MYTH:<br>  If you masturbate too much, you'll run out of semen and become sterile. <br>  FACT:<br>  Semen is a fully renewable resource. When you ejaculate semen, your body simply makes more — the same way your body makes more saliva after you spit. <br>  MYTH:<br>  People can tell whether you masturbate by how your penis looks. <br>  FACT:<br>  Masturbation does not change the appearance of your penis. (It does tend to cause an erection, but that usually goes away when you're finished.)

You have to get every other part of you body skinny before the weight on your face & lower belly starts to vanish.|`|c5c27986b3ee94f2278cab135604f066aa	don't think there is anything in particular you can do.<br>  <br>  if you are overweight, then losing weight in general will help.  If you are just blessed with chubby cheeks, not much you can do.  Age can sometimes help, just a matter of the skin not being quite as firm!  As i've gotten into my 30s I'm noticing my cheek bones are much more prominent and i'm losing my chubby cheeks!  I did lose a little weight too.<br>  <br>  if you wear make up then there is a way to apply it to kind of make your cheeks look more prominent, but I wouldn't be the one to tell you how!?

My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost surgery in India. Indian corporate hospitals are comparable to hospitals anywhere in the world. In fact, India has medical facilities that are comparable with the USA, UK and Canada. India offers World Class Medical Facilities, comparable with any of the western countries. India has state of the art Hospitals and the best medical experts. With the best infrastructure, the best possible Medical facilities, accompanied with the most competitive prices, you can get the treatment done in India at the lowest prices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|ff20e87ad8dd4ea3ce4acbf193b141aaaa	Excuse me, but your question sounds full of prejudice.

Come on, don't be so close-minded there is a HUGE world outside North America-Europe. Do you know who Niki Lauda is?

Please see a reputable doctor such as Denenberg, Davis or Toriumi. It might cost more, but you will end up paying a lot more in revisions if a surgeon abroad messes it up! <br>  <br>  And once it's done, it is permanent. HTH : )

Have you been on the computer a lot? I can easily stay up all night on the computer without really feeling tired, I just start to feel really strange, but not sleepy! Other activites could have the same effect, basically anything that is stimulating in some way (e.g. reading a reallly interesting book, watching TV, playing an addictive game, doing something else that you really enjoy), so if this is the case, stop doing it! Also, don't have any caffeine (including tea, chocolate etc) or very sugary things, as they will just help to keep you awake.<br>  <br>  I suggest you stop doing whatever you are doing, and go and get ready to go to bed. Make it very relaxing, maybe even have a bath & a hot drink (preferably not chocolate or anything else with caffeine in, try just sweetened warm milk, or a caffeine free/herbal tea), put some relaxing music on, then get into bed and read a book in dim light (make sure the book isn't TOO interesting or you won't want to go to sleep, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring!). Don't try to go to sleep, just relax, and eventually you will start to feel sleepy. When your eyes start to feel tired, put the book down & close your eyes (don't move too much at this point or you will wake yourself up again! Just leave the book on the bed next to you & make sure you don't have to reach far to turn out the light). If you still can't sleep, read for a bit longer & try again. Eventually you should drift off...<br>  <br>  If you have been up for two days you will be feeling pretty wired & it might not be easy to relax enough, but once you do manage it you should fall asleep pretty quickly! I often find that when I'm really tired it's actually *harder* to get to sleep for some reason, and it is also harder to be disciplined with myself about getting to bed, but once I get myself in bed & manage to relax I will then fall asleep pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  If you can't even make yourself go to bed, don't "decide" to go to bed, just tell yourself that you will go & *start* getting ready for bed. That will make it easier to motivate yourself & you'll probably find yourself in bed in no time!<br>  <br>  Basically: just stop doing anything that is stimulating, get yourself in the right frame of mind for going to bed (go through whatever bedtime routine you have, do something very relaxing etc), turn the lights down, get into bed & read something that isn't too gripping, don't try to go to sleep & eventually you'll start to feel your eyes drooping.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  ps If, after all that, you still can't sleep (give it a few more hours), then you do need to see a doctor asap as it is dangerous to be sleep deprived for too long.|`|809224dcd9fc569fcfea52fc3bbe4cf0aa	Lay off the meth pipe, drink yourself asleep, and stay off the meth pipe.

If you sleep all day and try to sleep at night as well, waking up occasionally to eat, then you will most certainly gain weight.  If you sleep all day, eat at night and do most of your activity at night, there will be no adverse effect on your metabolism.  That's partly why they have the "Don't eat after 8pm" rule.  Most people go to bed at 10pm.  Two hours is definitely not enought to optimally digest the food.  If you don't go to bed until 2AM, however, it makes no difference at all.|`|2db17481f4082dd7f8a1a28faec87e86aa	The reason people say that is because if you need to sleep during the day, you're not getting that great of sleep at night. And people to tend to sleep crummy at night, tend to eat more junk.<br>  <br>  Also, taking a nap during the day takes away time for exercise, which tends to compound the problem.<br>  <br>  The BMI is just a height to weight index.  There are lots of tools online to calculate it for you. try this one<br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a>|`|AA10066976	not true. it depends on the amount of exercise and eating habits. unless your sleep is a nap and then the body can slow metabolism because it does require a good night sleep whether that be during daylight or nightfall.
781b081e3dd7b1604718662d46ed5205aa	well, some disorders (esp. skin disorders) have same characteristic.( different a little bit) maybe see the doctor and and tell about your son.<br>  <br>  Impetigo is a common skin infection. It is most common in children, particularly children in unhealthy living conditions. In adults, it may follow other skin disorders. Impetigo may follow a recent upper respiratory infection such as a cold or other viral infection. It is similar to cellulitis, but is more superficial, involving infection of the top layers of the skin with streptococcus (strep), staphylococcus (staph), or both.<br>  <br>  The skin normally has many types of bacteria on it, but intact skin is an effective barrier that keeps bacteria from entering and growing within the body. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there, causing inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur with insect bites, animal bites, or human bites, or other injury or trauma to the skin. Impetigo may occur on skin where there is no visible break.<br>  <br>  Impetigo begins as an itchy, red sore that blisters, oozes and finally becomes covered with a tightly adherent crust. It tends to grow and spread. Impetigo is contagious. The infection is carried in the fluid that oozes from the blisters. Rarely, impetigo may form deeper skin ulcers.|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	Does the doctor who diagnosed your mother know about your son?  That may be a factor he or she did not take into consideration.  It may be wise to seek a second medical opinion if you are not happy with the first diagnosis, just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Mew, impetigo is highly contagious and usually contracted at school, so any kids can get it, irrespective of their living conditions.    If they have a break in their skin and come in contact, the chances are they will become infected.<br>  <br>  It is likely the son has infected the grandmother.|`|f6b0e1137c72766230e91c9b53dd2739aa	One possibility might be to take them to the same doctor at the same time...preferably the one who diagnosed your son...and try to get him/her to figure out what's going on with each of them.

(It does tend to cause an erection, but that usually goes away when you're finished.) <br>  ---------|`|AA10054229	you are the million person to ask this dum question.|`|AA11235749	It is not a harmful practice rather a way to fulfill the sexual thrust.|`|e9e9485dfc2ba53205874e3870587088aa	Is Masturbation Normal? <br>  While it once was regarded as a perversion and a sign of a mental problem, masturbation now is regarded as a normal, healthy sexual activity that is pleasant, fulfilling, acceptable and safe. It is a good way to experience sexual pleasure and can be done throughout life. <br>  Masturbation is only considered a problem when it inhibits sexual activity with a partner, is done in public, or causes significant distress to the person. It may cause distress if it is done compulsively and/or interferes with daily life and activities. <br>  Is Masturbation Harmful? <br>  The medical community considers masturbation to be a natural and harmless expression of sexuality for both men and women. It does not cause any physical injury or harm to the body, and can be performed in moderation throughout a person's lifetime as a part of normal sexual behavior. Some cultures and religions oppose the use of masturbation or even label it as sinful. This can lead to guilt or shame about the behavior. <br>  Some experts suggest that masturbation can actually improve sexual health and relationships. By exploring your own body through masturbation, you can determine what is erotically pleasing to you and can share this with your partner. Some partners use mutual masturbation to discover techniques for a more satisfying sexual relationship and to add to their mutual intimacy.|`|AA10872403	nah go for it have a good 1|`|ca5b99bba2bb2141a0dfb04919c4a1f3aa	dude not at all|`|f0f3ca7b83c04daaf5bbb91155d7a867aa	its harmful if its done very regularly....|`|a2c713ca2bf1c41f3e825a6f9164c1b3aa	Yes I strained  a neck muscle once!|`|d01df34ea93a4c45e27ff7491f1bc10aaa	NO.......masturbation is normal and beneficial for both men and women. The only thing even remotely harmful is that it is usually done by yourself. Mutual simultaneous masturbation by sex partners is much more satisfying....for both people involved. Stimulating and watching your partner orgasm is one of the greatest thrills I know. I absolutely love to feel her clitoris/vagina pulsing like a heartbeat over and over.

My father has a genetic blood clot disorder and he raised me on the symptoms of a blood clot.  <br>  <br>  If the doctor was worried that you had a clot, he would have put you in the hospital no questions asked.  It sounds more like a tendon issue.  Blood clots don't ususally hurt unless they go to a major organ like the lung, brain, or heart.  Chances are if you have a blood clot, you won't even know it unless it goes to one of these major organs.<br>  <br>  Tendonitis is when the tendons become inflamed.  This causes severe pain.  The symptoms of tendonitis are Pain when the tendon is under pressure In most cases this is the first tendonitis symptom to develop. Individuals may feel pain in the tendon when it's under pressure. This pressure could come from lifting weights, playing tennis, jumping, working with your hands or any type of manual job. Movement is restricted Individuals may find it hard to move the affected area. For example if the tendonitis has developed in the bicep the individual may not be able to restrict the arm fully.  Affected area is painful when moved or touched In the first stages of tendonitis pain only usually occurs when the tendons are under pressure. As the tendonitis develops pain will start to occur throughout the day whether the tendon is under pressure or not. The pain will occur when you touch the tendon and move the joint. Burning sensation around the affect area<br>  in some cases of tendonitis individuals have reported a "burning" sensation coming from the affected area. The burning is felt mostly after exercise or manual labor and in the morning or late at night. Affected area is swollen, red, warm or lumpy The tendon sheaths may be visibly swollen from the accumulation of fluid and inflammation. This is a sign that tendonitis has become more serious.<br>  <br>  Wear a knee brace and stay off of it for the next month and you should be okay...|`|707gOCvbaa	If it's warm to the touch in a small area then he can be a blood clot.

z2swEfTwaa	i know its scary because i was diagnosed with it 6 months ago. i dont have abnormal cells though. a coloposy is when the remove the abnormal cells before they turn into precancer cells. here are some facts:<br>  -80% of people get HPV at one point inn their lives, most never know it<br>  -90% of peoples immune system clears the virus on its own. <br>  -alot of people get abnormal cells and clear them on their own, but its always better to be safe then sorry (get them removed!)<br>  -10% will have it the rest of their lives. and a small % of those will develop cancer. <br>  -cancer can take up to 10-15 years to develop.<br>  -younger women have a better chance of clearing the virus<br>  -after 2 years you usually have cleared the virus, some times up to 5. but you can still get other strains of it. theres over 100. so be more safe.<br>  <br>  so, what you need to do, TAKE BEE- PROPOLIS (it helps the most), dont stress out, dont smoke, take vitamins (multi vita, vits c, garlic), exercise, practice safe sex, be happy, and healthy. oh and always get your yearly pap! after 3 normal paps, your usually out of the woods, but still get that yearly pap. it saves lives. HPV isnt that scary once you know that facts, and stay healthy. oh, and you can still have kids, just wait the 2 year until it clears and talk with your doctor. remember, everything is going to be ok. we all make mistakes or get our selves into trouble, but things always work out. feel free to talk to me more if you want. good luck and take care!|`|S97z99oHaa	I understand...Actually there are alot of guys who are willing to accept that.About three months ago I caught HPV genital warts from a guy who I thought I loved..It turned out he was a manwhore.I knew him for years and I trusted him..I didn't ask to catch this..and after finding out I thought I would never live a normal life again..To be honest I thought no guy would ever be interested in me again.I thought of myself as,"Nasty"..But u would be surprised at how many guys know this about me and still try and talk to me.My boyfriend right now loves me and accepts the fact that I have this.We use condomns all the time..and I get treated.He's totally ok with it.I realized that I can still live a normal life.If he truely loves you then he should accept it.

And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things.

XtXx546eaa	lol Here's my headache/migraine guide. I'm 17 and I've been getting migraines since I was 17.<br>  <br>   - Find a good medicine that works for you. Excedrin Migraine or Excedrin Tension work great for me depending on the type. It's also a good idea to take something like Tylenol PM if you have a headache at night. This will not only help you get to sleep quicker, which is the best pain reliever, but if helps you sleep all night. And be sure to avoid taking medicines with caffeine in them at night.<br>  <br>   - My grandma taught me this trick, because part of my headaches are due to bad circulation. This should help anyone though. Lay down flat on your back with your legs straight out and together. Concentrate on breathing slowly and deeply from your whole body. It helps if you picture something like your blood flowing up from your legs up to your head. *<br>  <br>  * - For some reason, it also helps me if I have my hands/arms against my skin, so I usually have them flat against my bare legs, or have them crossed at the wrists on my stomach. This might just be personal. But it's good to find a position that you're comfortable with. Comfort and relaxation are key.<br>  <br>   - Your breathing is important. Find out whether breathing through your nose or mouth helps you relax and take your mind off the pain. It could be different depending on what kind of headache you. <br>  <br>   - Cold. There are plenty of different ways of cooling your forehead and neck, which usually help with headaches.<br>   <br>  1. Cold patches. My Mom hasn't been able to find any in a while, but they used to sell these cloth patches with a sort of cooling gel on one side and you would stick it to your forehead or neck.<br>  <br>   2. Cooling lotions. There are cooling lotions you can buy that are sort of similar to the patches. You smooth it on your forehead/neck and and it remains cool. Very soothing.<br>  <br>  3. Wet washcloth. Easily moved to any place you need comfort.<br>  <br>  3. Cold packs wrapped in towel or alone. I usually start off with them wrapped in a towel, then remove it when they get a  little less icy. If you don't have an ice pack, you can use ice cubes in a plastic bag.<br>  <br>   - Again, comfort. Find the place you are most comfortable. For me, that's always my Moms bed. It's probably more mental then physical, but I can relax much easier in there. Also, having people smooth my forehead, blow on it, and pray over me help. Silence and darkness also help, or having a white noise machine. BTW, the smell of mint is very soothing for headaches.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're like me and get lots of headaches/migraines, learn to pick your fights. You probably aren't gonna be able to lay down for every one, so you should learn to tell which ones are gonna be serious. And be sure you that when it is serious, you go lay down.

OsT64mqMaa	Signs are definitely of an infection. Get a screening kit from a local store if you can't get in to see a doctor.|`|fd736f8d0c09ac8e05985c431be15b30aa	Sounds like an infection, maybe a yeast infection.  You'll need to see your doctor about having some swabs done so you can be treated with antibiotics.|`|P0s7ylHAaa	You could have a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. Both are super easy to treat, but are caused by two different things. If it's a yeast infection, get some 3-day Monistat at CVS. If you've already read up on the symptoms of a yeast infection and they don't match your symptoms, then go to Planned Parenthood or see your Gyno because you could have bacterial vaginosis, which is a scary name for a pretty common infection. It just means the bacteria in your vagina got unstable. They'll give you a prescription for a week, it's pretty cheap and should clear it right up. But go to the doctor (even if it's just a walk-in clinic) because you don't want to find out it's something more serious.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	It sounds like muscle pain rather then cardiac related pain caused by squeezing you too tight.  It would be no different then if I pinch you and it hurts for a while where I pinch you at.  Keep in mind only a physician in person and diagnose anything.

e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	Debridement is usually just cleaning out the areas above the gumline to make it quicker and easier for the root planing.<br>  <br>  The biggest difference between the two, is that root planing is designed to go deep, below the gumline. Because we are going so low below the gumline we give anesthesia so it won't be so uncomfortable. The anesthesia also helps control the bleeding that usually occurs during this procedure.<br>  <br>  Generally if debridement is done after scaling and root planing it's more like a follow up exam to see how the tissues responded. It's also done because many times we can't clean everything out (might leave pieces behind). If the gums are still red and bleeding then we use the follow up appointment to clean that area out and would have to anesthetize again.<br>  <br>  If the gums look great and you're doing a great job maintaining them, then it could be a very quick appointment.<br>  <br>  They are very similar procedures, but the root planing is supposed to address the deep pockets or areas of bleeding and infection.

A  far as being healthy, people have varying ideas of what is considered to be healthy.it uses lettuce and onions and has whole wheat taco and low fat meat cheese and fat free sour cream so i would say it is healthier than the traditionally made type!  I would avoid the boiling of the ground beef which sounds very unappetizing and like it would suck all the flavor and juiciness out of the meat. Cook the ground beef in a non stick pan and drain slightly on paper towels instead. Also 1 teaspoon of sour cream is not enough...more like 1 tablespoon would be right. and since its fat free.....
IKakoOfyaa	Peridex mouthwash can be used to help prevent thrush but if you already have it, using any type of mouthwash with an antibacterial is not recommended.  Killing off helpful bacteria is a factor in making people more susceptible to thrush.<br>  <br>  Your doctor can prescribe a formulation referred to as "Magic Mouthwash" that contains an antifungal, a local anesthetic, a corticosteroid, an antihistamine and antacid that speeds healing.|`|kru2LVPyaa	NONE. I have a weakened immune system and prone to thrush. I have to take Advair because of severe asthma. One of the side effects is thrush. I decided to use Listerine 4 times a day to try and "kill" the yeast/thrush infection. It got worse. (I was also being treated with Nystatin swish and swallow 'mouthwash'). Then I was taking Q-tips soaked in Listerine and trying to wipe away the white spots, and that did not work to clear it up. The doctor put me on "Fluconazole  and that did not completely work. So, I did another round of Fluconazole and STOPPED the mouthwash routine after reading many postings on the internet. My thrush is FINALLY starting to clear up. I also have started using probiotics -- powder, mixed with  juice -- and drinking that so the good bacteria coats my mouth and throat. This seems to be working, but first and foremost -- NO MOUTHWASH. Brush your teeth -- no alcohol. Also -- limit sugary drink intake -- the sugar feeds the yeast infection.|`|2IATHTXwaa	Listerine it's the best!|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	You cant just buy a mouth wash to get rid of thrush.  Thrush is a fungus and when you swish around listerine you kill off more of the bacteria that keeps the fungus in check.  You have to go to the doctor and get some stuff...cant think of the name of the swish stuff but there's also a pill called fluconisol (not sure about the spelling).  <br>  Im more concerned about why you have thrush?  Have you been on antibiotics or breathing treatments?  Thrush is a very common symptom of HIV.  Im not suggesting that that is the only possibility but if there is a chance, you should consider getting tested.<br>  Also, when you treat for thrush, you should throw away your tooth brush and any reusable water bottles, stuff like that.  You cant kill those fungus with even bleach so you should replace them all.  Good luck.

Bqi7jmsPaa	If you think you are unhealthy, you should visit a doctor.  While there are people who are anemic, you don't sound like one to me.<br>  <br>  At 16 you're probably still growing like mad and your metabolism (the way the body gets energy from the food you eat) is very high at that age as well.  Those are the two major reasons you aren't gaining weight.  Everything you eat is going to fuel your high metabolism (lucky you--you'll wish that were still the case in about 20 years) and to support your body's development.<br>  <br>  There is actually no "ideal" BMI for kids due to the bodily processes mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Again, if you're feeling tired and "think" you have a problem, visit your doctor.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Start bodybuilding.<br>  <br>  Watch the movie "Pumping Iron" with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Don't worry It's  natural many men and women have uneven chest. But if its due to exercising then you need to work on the side that needs building and toning a little more than the other side.

The website is www.myhealthabc.com once you fill in your details then you can see the full range of products they have. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight, its all nutrition based.<br>  I lost all my weight in less than three months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them, the tips you get and encouragement are excellent (their advice and time is FREE). I am still with them so I stay healthy. If you just want to buy the products and not use the coaching then you can do that aswell, there is a link in there to email them so you can tell them you just want to buy and not speak to anyone. The owners will even advise you via email on what to purchase depending on what you want to lose, my sister did it this way (she was more self conscious than me) and lost 76 pounds in less than five months. These guys are just great, try them.

AA12148528	The reason is that the lining of the uterus is coming off. Your body does it by contracting itself. That is where the crams come from.|`|AA11944913	Menstrual cramps are among the symptoms that most often accompany menstruation. They are a type of pelvic pain characterized by sharp cramping or a dull aching sensation in the lower abdomen. Many women experience these symptoms just before and during their menstrual periods. The medical term for menstrual cramps is dysmenorrhea. However, physicians most often use the term when describing severe menstrual pain that interferes with daily life or that may require medical treatment for an underlying disorder.<br>  <br>  There are two types of menstrual cramps:<br>  <br>  Primary dysmenorrhea. Lower abdominal pain that occurs during a woman’s menses and is not associated with any type of physical abnormality or disease. It usually begins within three years of the onset of menstruation (menarche).<br>  <br>  In this type of dysmenorrhea, the pain characteristically begins at the start of menstruation and gradually diminishes over two to three days. Usually, the pain is strongest in the abdomen, although some women experience pain in their back or thighs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Secondary dysmenorrhea. The occurrence of painful menstruation accompanying an underlying physical condition such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids or chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).<br>  <br>  Menstrual cramps are very common and often are not a cause of concern. However, if a woman experiences dysmenorrhea that interferes with daily life for several days a month, or if she is older and is just starting to experience the severe cramps, it is important that she contact a physician for an examination.  <br>  <br>  If left untreated, some of the pelvic conditions associated with secondary dysmenorrhea (e.g., endometriosis, PID) can chronically interfere with daily activities and compromise a woman’s reproductive health, possibly resulting in infertility. Identifying the underlying cause of dysmenorrhea is the first step for successful treatment.|`|cede12bf736f1426517d23f2b1acbd66aa	ask your doc  cause it seems that your too young to know about this kinda stuff|`|pjGpgDtxaa	the blood clots.|`|AA11974580	Menstruation is the simple process of shedding the old uterine lining to make way for a new one. In other words, it's the body's way of sweeping out the cobwebs at the end of the month in preparation for the arrival of a new egg and a new cycle; all a part of the natural baby-making process with one goal in mind: conception.<br>  Because your uterus needs to shed its lining, it must cramp and squeese to get it to sluff off.  <br>  Taking motrin will help relieve some of the pain, but it might make your peoiod last longer.  That stuff has to come out sometime.|`|3a28df6740b82a80c415de93581a4554aa	well you know how your leg muscle can cramp up the same thing can happen to the uterus because its a muscle too.There really isnt anything you can do to stop the cramps besides getting pain relievers.Some  girls just dont get cramps.

69b0193d84557fa297350e9678ba47d4aa	first and foremost, congratulations on making the decision to quit smoking and NOT going back.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you start exercising at least 5 times per week.  It will take commitment to get going and keep it going but you have already demonstrated that you can do it.  <br>  <br>  Start with a 1/2 walk on the treadmill then do some weight lifting for about 20 minutes.  Remember to alternate areas, one day arms, next day legs.<br>  <br>  Eat healthy snacks, fruit, yogurt and if you have to have something sweet...try sucking on peppermint candy or skittles.<br>  <br>  Once you get use to being on the treadmill for the 1/2 hour, increase your time on the machine and do 45 minutes or so.  This will help burn more calories.  Try walking then jogging every 1/4 of a mile.  Eventually you will be able to run longer - thus burning more calories!  Believe me you will get to a point where you will get an adrenaline rush you won't believe.  Its incredible!<br>  <br>  Bottom line, exercise and watch your calorie intake.<br>  <br>  you will do just fine.<br>  <br>  Again, Congratulations!|`|AA11455628	People often compensate for their oral fixation IE the cigarette with another that being food in your case.

5b9d03b236e962888e610d1ff85050deaa	It could be a boil on it's way.  Try hot compresses, and it might come to a 'head'. Don't squeeze it. It might take a few days to come to it's full size. Keep it clean and not sweaty. <br>  <br>  Probably go see a Dr to check it out. Sometimes breast abcesses can be difficult to get rid of.<br>  <br>  There is an epidemic of MRSA infections going around, but those boil looking, red areas don't  usually hurt, and you usually have more of  them.  If it gets bigger and bigger,  but doesn't have a 'head' like a pimple, it could be this. <br>  Get on the right antibiotics if it is. See an infectious disease Dr. who knows the latest on this.  It's a new strain in the community, and is a 'superbug'. <br>  I had this, and had a large red lesion on my breast. The rest were on my back.<br>  <br>  I'm not a Dr, but I've never seen a cancer that starts like this. Cancer usually doesn't hurt, believe it or not. Not until far gone. It's a hard lump that feels fixed, not like the movable lumps we have that are normal breast tissue.<br>  <br>  Breast cysts can hurt, but are rarely harmful.<br>  <br>  There is a type of skin cancer that is on the skin of the breast, called inflammatory breast cancer. <br>   It doesn't sound like it, but go get checked out just in case.|`|AA10541030	It  may be a boil or cyst.

Brown rice, whole grains (but not wheat bread, unless it has more than 3g fiber per slice) dark green veggies (spinach, brocolli rabe, etc), protein (nuts or fish, but NOT red meat) and drink lots of clear fluids like water and tea.

O fato de fingir pode ser por querer agradar, para n?o ter que dar explica??es(ao contrário do homem que diz que n?o sabe o que aconteceu, a mulher sempre sabe porque n?o deu), para n?o ser rotulada de fria, por sentir alguma dor ou ainda ela pode estar com problemas mesmo e tem medo que o parceiro a deixe porque ela n?o sente nada, sei lá muitas coisas. <br>  Só acho que a mulher n?o deve come?ar uma coisa se na? estiver a fim

Embora nem sempre causem sintomas, seu tamanho e localiza??o podem causar problemas em algumas mulheres, como por exemplo, sangramento ginecológico importante e dor em baixo ventre.<br>  <br>  As causas exatas do aparecimento dos miomas n?o s?o bem estabelecidas, mas os pesquisadores acreditam que haja tanto uma predisposi??o genética quanto uma maior sensibilidade à estimula??o hormonal (principalmente estrogênio) nas mulheres que apresentam miomas. Algumas mulheres que podem ter esta predisposi??o, desenvolvem fatores que permitem que estes cres?am sob a influência dos horm?nios femininos. Isto explicaria porque certos grupos étnicos e familiares s?o mais propensos a ter miomas.

You mean height and elevation sort of thing? If I'm understanding correctly, at higher altitudes your lungs are forced against more pressure and therefore you have to spend more energy maintaining them and using them. From there your lungs can build capacity and resistance. And yes, it increases blood cell counts so your body can get more oxygen. I'm just using an indirect inference, though.. hope it helps somewhat.

Most of the machines have to be adjusted for your height.  <br>  <br>  If your gym doesn't provide this consultation every six weeks as part of the membership, I strongly suggest that you look for another gym that does.

Vc vai conhecer melhor o que acontece para depois manejarmos a sua ansiedade. <br>  Após esse trabalho cognitivo, damos início à parte comportamental, onde vc irá aprender na ′prática como controlar os ataques, usando tudo que foi discutido na terapia. <br>  O tratamento pode ser em grupo, o que tem apresentado ótimos resultados, ou individual. Trabalho com grupos de 2 meses de dura??o e fvi muita gente se superando. Achei uma delícia`andar de metr? com uma senhora que n?o entrava numa esta??o há 10 anos.

23d498099141738ac747d8acda3e92a7aa	I believe to fully understand the immune system you have to understand that its main goal is to differenciate between self and non-self.  Since a baby is genetically different, a mothers immune system maybe detrimental and cause an autoimmune disease (lupus, diabetes I, Rh arthritis).<br>  <br>  Also, mother and baby do not share a full blood to blood connection and in fact its the opposite, the placenta is a large filter and prevents contact between maternal and fetal blood.  Certain substances like oxygen, food, and many drugs do cross over there is no cross of blood cells.  Certain antibodies are too large to cross whereas other antibodies cross.  This is why a baby is effectively born with their mothers immunity.<br>  <br>  A baby is born with mothers immunity and this immunity comes from her antibodies.  The antibodies are only proteins and not cells.  As the proteins travel they break down and become inactive.  This is why a baby only has immunity for 6 months and then becomes immunocompromised until the child's own antibodies can be generated.<br>  <br>  In the US, we vaccinate children early so their immune system to can be developing protection before the mothers antibodies disappear.  Unfortunately, in very young child the immune system is so immature that the shot does not produce sufficient antibody response and this is why shot are often given mulitple times (or at least one of the reasons).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, this is a good question.|`|362bd03075564a0a3a458c2bdaf243ebaa	The baby lives off the mothers immune system for the first 6 months from when they are born.|`|pjGpgDtxaa	The reason ois simple.Even though they share blood,the babie becomes it's own person  or whatever.They have their own blood.& they have 2 build up their own immune system.&,after there born,they now have their own blood.As soon as a child is born in2 the world,their body is exposed 2 all the things they weren't in the womb.The womb is a much safer place than the world.*|`|37a004ff672fa1381843e66b4f794717aa	because simple put we are a biologically advanced species capable of learning quickly and efficiently. we are born with an inlane desire to do so. more primitive species are born with such genetic imprents. our species, more versitile and capable of adapting to new circumstances faster, does not have born knowledge. this is advantagious if circumstances change because if more of our knowledge was genetic we would be unable to alter and addapt ourselves to the new environment and we wouldsimply die.|`|b419d59da460166ec2679951781862afaa	Immune systems are acquired.

vgyIefZpaa	One thing that's true is that yawning IS contagious.  It's scientific studies.  When you're tired, your breathing gets shallow, and your lungs have to make up for that.  Mostly it's because you're tired, and if you see someone yawn, your brain thinks that it is tired too, so you yawn.  Interesting eh?|`|AA10923090	You always yawn when you are tired or if you feel like taking a deep breath. And you yawn because you want to sleep because there is a strange tingle that comes through your body starting from your feet to your eyes which causes your eyes to feel heavy and before it can reach your eyes, it goes to your mouth and makes you yawn. But you don't actually feel the strange tingle!|`|wiTkLZKYaa	I think when you are tired your breathing slows down, the lack of oxygen makes you yawn, intaking a big breath.

d0c1374e77c4a7f9c740e1a95f3eec92aa	Você descreve claramente um quadro de Transtorno ou Distúrbio Obsessivo-Compulsivo (TOC ou DOC). Até parece que leu o texto abaixo! Procure por um médico psiquiatra sem demora, pois há tratamento para o se mal.<br>  <br>  <br>   - Distúrbio Obsessivo-Compulsivo<br>  <br>  O distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo caracteriza-se pela presen?a de idéias, imagens ou impulsos recorrentes, indesejados e intrusos que parecem tolos, esquisitos, indecentes ou horríveis (obsess?es) e de uma urgência ou uma compuls?o para fazer algo que elimine o desconforto causado pela obsess?o. Os temas obsessivos onipresentes s?o o dano, o risco ou o perigo. Entre as obsess?es comuns est?o as preocupa??es no que diz respeito à contamina??o, a dúvida, a perda e a agressividade. Caracteristicamente, os indivíduos com um distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo sentem-se compelidos a realizar rituais (atos intencionais repetidos com um objetivo) para controlar uma obsess?o, como, por exemplo, lavar-se e limpar-se para ficar livre de contamina??o, verifica??es repetidas para suprimir as dúvidas, guardar as coisas para evitar perdas e evitar as pessoas que podem ser objeto de agress?o. A maioria dos rituais, como o de lavar as m?os excessivamente ou de verificar várias vezes se uma porta foi trancada, podem ser observados.<br>  Outros rituais s?o mentais, como as contagens repetidas ou as afirma??es para diminuir o perigo. Esse distúrbio é diferente da personalidade obsessiva-compulsiva. Os indivíduos podem tornar-se obsessivos em rela??o a praticamente qualquer coisa e seus rituais nem sempre est?o logicamente relacionados ao desconforto que eles procuram minimizar. Por exemplo, um indivíduo preocupado com a contamina??o pode sentir diminui??o do desconforto ao colocar casualmente a m?o em um bolso. A partir desse momento, cada vez que ele sente uma obsess?o relacionada à contamina??o, ele irá colocar a m?o repetidamente no bolso. A maioria dos indivíduos com um distúrbio obsessivo- compulsivo tem consciência de que suas obsess?es n?o refletem riscos reais. Eles percebem que o seu comportamento físico e mental é exagerado a ponto de ser estranho. Por essa raz?o, o distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo difere dos distúrbios psicóticos, nos quais os indivíduos perdem o contato com a realidade. O distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo afeta cerca de 2,3% dos adultos e ocorre de forma aproximadamente igual em homens e mulheres. Como os indivíduos com distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo temem passar vergonha ou ser estigmatizados, eles freqüentemente realizam seus rituais secretamente, embora estes possam exigir várias horas por dia. Aproximadamente um ter?o dos indivíduos com esse tipo de distúrbio apresenta depress?o no momento que que ele é diagnosticado. Em conjunto, dois ter?os tornam-se deprimidos em algum momento.<br>  <br>  Tratamento<br>  <br>  A terapia de exposi??o, um tipo de terapia comportamental, freqüentemente ajuda os indivíduos com distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo. Nesse tipo de terapia, o paciente é exposto a situa??es ou a pessoas que desencadeiam obsess?es, rituais ou desconforto. O desconforto ou a ansiedade do paciente diminuem gradualmente se ele evitar de realizar o ritual durante exposi??es repetidas ao estímulo que o desencadeia. Desse modo, ele aprende que o ritual n?o é necessário para diminuir o desconforto. Em geral, o tratamento dura anos, provavelmente porque aqueles que conseguem aprender a utilizar esse método de auto-ajuda continuam a utilizá-lo como um modo de vida sem muito esfor?o após o término do tratamento. Os medicamentos também podem ajudar muitos indivíduos com distúrbio obsessivo-compulsivo. Três deles (a clomipramina, a fluoxetina e a fluvoxamina) foram aprovados especificamente para esse uso e foi demonstrado que outros dois (a paroxetina e a sertralina) também s?o eficazes. Outros medicamentos antidepressivos também s?o usados, mas com uma freqüência muito menor. A psicoterapia, com o objetivo de um maior conhecimento e compreens?o dos conflitos subjacentes, n?o tem se mostrado eficaz para aqueles que sofrem de um distúrbio obsessivocompulsivo. Comumente, o melhor tratamento consiste em uma combina??o do tratamento medicamentoso e a terapia comportamental.|`|45e6eb74995ae803c85c3aa69fc75271aa	O que você tem, provavelmente, é TOC - Transtorno Obsessivo Compulsivo. <br>  Você vai precisar de terapia psquiátrica intensa e, eventualmente, tratamento medicamentoso.|`|771559aba354880b258cff934b58e7cfaa	é bom cuidar da higiene, lavar as m?os antes de comer, etc,<br>  evita muitas doen?as.

Boa sorte!|`|7d8c4d05dae1548c5ef6795d16a7aea2aa	Sem dúvida nenhuma, pelo que vc relatou, vc sofre de TRANSTORNO OBSESSIVO-COMPULSIVO. Essa variante (medo de contamina??o) é uma das mais comuns.<br>  A doen?a tem bases dualísticas: um pensamento obsessivo (no seu caso, o medo exremo de contamina??o) gera um comportamento compulsivo (lavar as m?os várias vezes, lavar talheres, n?o encostar em ninguém).<br>  Muitas vezes, o pensamento obsessivo é aliviado após a realiza??o compulsiva; porém, há uma tendência de que as obsess?es se tornem de difícil alívio, e os atos compulsivos acabam ficando mais complexos (por exemplo: uma mesma idéia que agora gera uma lavagem das m?os pode, mais adiante, gerar a lavagem das m?os mais a troca de todas as pe?as de roupas mais um banho atrás do outro). Isso foi exatamente o que ocorreu com a atriz Luciana Vendramini, que acabou necessitando de banhos de 16 horas para aliviar suas obsess?es.<br>  Recomendo: PSIQUIATRA.|`|Bt6VMYhGaa	Ter hábitos higiênicos e prevenir circunstancias que possam acarretar contamina??o por seres patogênicos é normal e até recomendável. Contudo, no seu caso, esse hábito deixou os limites do razoável. Lembre-se que o corpo tem um sistema imunológico bastanmte habil para lidar com os germes comuns do dia-a-dia. N?o há, pois, motivo para proceder com foi descrito.<br>  Em termos psicológicos, esse é um distúrbio conhecido como transtorno obsessivo compulsivo. Ele se baseia em uma obsess?o (uma idéia irrazoavelmente fixa) que acarreta habitos compulsórios (prática repetida, mesmo que sem necessidade). é um distúrbio que tem tratamentoeficaz, e que pode se basear em remédios e terapia de grupo. Um bom meio para sanar esse distúrbio é se convencer da verdade: a maior parte do que há no mundo tem germes, mas eles s?o quase todos neutralizados elo organismo.<br>  E o principal: n?o perca sua auto-estima pensando ser louco. N?o existe loucura, o que existe é apenas uma forma diferente de ser e pensar o mundo, o mais das vezes incompreendido pelas pessoas. A única coisa a resolver no seu caso é o fato de essa forma de ver o mundo estar prejudicando sua vida em grupo e o tornando infeliz. Lembre-se que a felicidade é o fim último da vida, e tudo aquilo que venha a obstá-la deve ser resolvido.|`|Rw0zhspeaa	Vc está doenteeeeeeeeeeee ...isso naum é vida saudavel...precisa procurar um médico urgente!!!!<br>  como uma pessoa vive preocupada com esse tipo de coisa ... naum é normal...procure um médico o mais rápido possivel... vc pode fikar doido da cabe?a ( se já naum está)<br>  vlw|`|XJ7JondXaa	Você está co mania de limpeza.

OfzYelQRaa	O mioma ou leiomioma é um tumor BENIGNO que se instala no tecido uterino. Pode estar localizado na parte de fora do útero (sub-seroso), na parede (intramural) ou no interior (submucoso). é possível engravidar com um mioma dependendo do tamanho deste e da sua localiza??o. No ano 2000 vi uma paciente de 26 anos com um mioma de 500 gramas e 15 centímetros. Nessa oportunidade se abriu o útero, se retirou o mioma e a paciente engravidou um par de anos depois. Como podes ver se trata de um tumor benigno que n?o causa estragos no tecido uterino. No teu caso, aconselho fazer um exame de sangue b-HCG pra confirmar ou n?o uma possível gravidez, que, se confirmada deve de ser acompanhada com exames ecograficos seguidos pra poder observar tanto a crian?a como a evolu??o deste mioma.

37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	No. I do no think is a good idea going with you doctor and tell him that, what you need do, tell him exactly how do you feel, all that symptoms, whit out missing one, we have a lot of disses feel like depression, anaemia, leukaemia, cancer, stress, chronic fatigue etc. etc. He'll run some test on you to find out what is wrong with you. Do not worry any health problem can be treated if you catch it on time. <br>  Six month after my mother die, I got very sick, I did know what was wrong with me, flu, breathing problems. I when to see the doctor, he did start asking me question he told me I was depress, until then I didn't know I was still grieving my mom death.|`|1ihCFuSGaa	Tell him  " I'm Depressed, what should I do?"|`|7KYC625daa	I'm a nurse. Call the doctor and schedule an appointment for depression. This way he will know and adjust himself on how to help you before you reach the office. Take care and all the best.|`|BLEPG33Haa	Depression and being depressed are different things. I think the most definite symptom of depression is a constant fear of death. Theres thousands of conditions that could have similar symptoms of depression. Just reading about health issues could cause a hypochondrial reaction and lead one to believe they have the symptoms. <br>  <br>  Thats why it is important to not go into a doctors office with an agenda of convincing them you have a certain ailment. Just telling them you feel depressed is different as long as you are truthful about how you are feeling. Anti-depressants should be a last resort, as opposed to leading a more active lifestyle, and aren't miracle pills. <br>  <br>  It has been my experience that most doctors will spend little time talking with you and just write a prescription. You should see a therapist or a doctor who will try to get to the root of the problem. You should also be seeing someone whom you feel comfortable enough with to discuss these things.|`|e1a5c099621543beb976d8f9e456b586aa	That is EXACTLY what you do. You go in and say, I think I am depressed. Your doctor will be good enough to gently and gradually get the rest of the information out of you in case you are unable to offer further details yourself. But yes, that is EXACTLY the first step. Go to your doctor and say you are depressed.|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	Sure, just tell him that you're depressed, they hear it all the time.

Sure hope you feel better soon.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	with my Dr I said; "hey doc, I'm depressed, any suggestions ?"<br>  (unquote)

8a0d75fe385778132dd2128cb07948f5aa	Bacteria in your intestines produce gas in the process of digesting some foods (broccoli, beans, cheeses to name a few).|`|AA11040867	Flatulence occurs when a food does not break down completely in the stomach and small intestine. As a result, the food makes it into the large intestine in an undigested state. For example, if you are "lactose intolerant," it means that you lack an enzyme (lactase) in your intestine -- the enzyme that breaks lactose apart into two sugar molecules so they can enter the bloodstream. Without lactase, lactose passes undigested through the stomach and small intestine and arrives in the large intestine. <br>  <br>  There, the lactose meets up with billions of hungry bacteria -- the natural "intestinal fauna" we all have in our large intestine. These bacteria are happy to digest lactose. They produce a variety of gases, in much the way that yeast produces carbon dioxide to leaven bread (see How Bread Works for details on yeast). Gases such as methane, hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide are common gases that these bacteria produce. Hydrogen sulfide is the source of the odor we associate with flatulence. <br>  <br>  Certain foods produce more flatulence than others because they contain more indigestible carbohydrates than others. Beans, as you might expect, are particularly well-endowed in this regard.|`|DdhNmfXpaa	we fart because the sh*t particals are too small to form a peice of poop

919c7513d6b989f03e939adf3d3c3ba8aa	Subdural hematomas can often take up to 3 weeks to manifest themselves. Chronic subdural bleeds develop over the period of days to weeks, often after minor head trauma, though such a cause is not identifiable in 50% of patients (Downie, 2001). The bleeding from a chronic bleed is slow, probably from repeated minor bleeds, and usually stops by itself (University of Vermont; Graham and Gennareli, 2000). Since these bleeds progress slowly, they present the chance to be stopped before they cause significant damage. Small subdural hematomas, those less than a centimeter wide, have much better outcomes than acute subdural bleeds: in one study, only 22% of patients with chronic subdural bleeds had outcomes worse than "good" or "complete recovery" (Wagner, 2004).<br>  <br>  It is important that a patient receive medical assessment, including a complete neurological examination, after any head trauma. A CT scan or MRI scan will usually detect significant subdural hematomas.<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms of subdural hematoma include the following:<br>  <br>  A history of recent head injury <br>  Loss of consciousness or fluctuating levels of consciousness <br>  Seizures <br>  Numbness <br>  Headache (either constant or fluctuating) <br>  Dizziness <br>  Disorientation <br>  Amnesia <br>  Weakness or lethargy <br>  Nausea or vomiting <br>  Personality changes <br>  Inability to speak or slurred speech <br>  Ataxia, or difficulty walking <br>  Altered breathing patterns <br>  Deviated gaze, or abnormal movement of the eyes (Wagner, 2004).|`|AA11044730	Yes.<br>  <br>  You're not out of the woods for at least 24 hours.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to keep an eye on the victim and wake them regularly to make sure they are coherent and concious.|`|AA11429639	You would have a concussion immediately; the symptoms could take some time to show up.  <br>  <br>  However, usually you would have had a momentary loss of consciousness.|`|AA11546963	the actual concussion happens pretty much instantaneously.

Todo Celíaco que n?o transgride a doen?a, tende a ter um aumento do peso corporal, e desta forma deve ter uma dieta equilibrada.

E você também!<br>  Felicidade!|`|an6xxSGhaa	Sim.  tive um sonho tendo uma filha, minha m?e  pegava na minha m?o ajudando acortar o cord?o umbilical e depois me mostrando dizendo" veja minha filha é uma menina" três dias depois verifique que estava atrasada (3) dias , a procura de um médico fiz exames e ele acreditou na gravidez pelo o sonho, com 3 meses fui  operada com dores que acharam que era apendiciti, abriram-me e constataram a gravidez apenas fecharam ,com 6 meses entrei em trabalho de parto, ao 7 meses tive contra??es até de 10 em 10minutos no 8 mês  a minha filha nasceu medindo 55cm e com 2.380 grs sem pigmenta??o da pele e sem cilios, sobrancelhas, vale salientar que na época n?o se tinha ultrasonografia e quando nasceu era a mesma menina que eu vi no sonho.

Qag8NzbPaa	You have not stated any signs or symptoms, but the best thing to do is go to the Doctor.  Often it is the fear of the unknown that creates anxiety or panic.  Untill you can see a Doctor try some calming aids like sipping camonmile tea, a relaxing bath, breathing exercises etc going for a walk or snuggling on the sofa with a good movie to take your mind off it till you can go.<br>  <br>  As I said not knowing the symptoms or signs the best you can be offered is advice on how to reduce your anxiety.<br>  <br>  If anxiety becomes pronounced, it can express itself in various ways. For example, you may have trouble falling asleep; dwell on a particular situation and find it difficult to think of something else; feel tense, restless, jittery, dizzy and sweaty; have trouble concentrating; overeat or lose your appetite; be overly vigilant and startle easily; have a feeling of impending disaster, as if "something bad is going to happen;" or are depressed (anxiety can mask depression).|`|AA10326530	Might have a generalized anxiety disorder, medicine and counseling could help. Good luck with the doc tomorrow.
AA10231499	I think of it like this, 'cause I have the same problem:<br>  <br>  I'm working hard enough to lose the weight right now, imagine if I were to top another 20 pounds, I'd have to work even harder.<br>  <br>  Just saying that statement to myself makes me put down that piece of cake or that cupcake and I start chopping some celery instead.<br>  <br>  Also, next time you go grocery shopping just buy fruits, vegetables, etc, anything except junk food. If you don't have it in the house, you can't eat it, so you'll have to settle for the healthy food. If you have to buy junk food, buy those 100 calorie packs, those are such a lifesaver to me!|`|LfVepz9Raa	just pick one day each week to eat junk. only one and stick to eat.|`|KSkQjtXhaa	I have that same problem when it comes to chips.  The only solution for me is to not buy them in the first place. <br>  <br>  But if you are craving a cookie or cupcake, try a substitute like a Weight Watchers cookie bar and promise yourself that you can have a regular cookie tomorrow -- then when tomorrow rolls around, push that craving another day.  Before you know a whole week will have gone by and you won't have had a cookie!

oXf5CdQVaa	cut your carbs down|`|vlSUi2a0aa	Many people ask me how they can slim down. I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").<br>  <br>  The Hoodia sold at <a href="http://www.about4me.info/free-diet-pills.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.about4me.info/free-diet-pills...</a>  is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market. It's pure, has no side effects, and they give you a free sample bottle (there is a $6.95 shipping and handling charge).<br>  Fantastic results have been seen with this particular Hoodia.

Look at a diagram of the female anatomy on the web and print it out.  Take a hand mirror and look at all of your body parts.  Next look at the leaflet in the tampon box.  It shows the tampon going up and towards the back not straight in.  This is how you have to insert it.   Up and kind of pointed to the back.|`|iv2YPrsKaa	look it up on google|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Hi ... take a look at this website xx|`|AA11040867	There are so many reasons why it was not comfortable, firstly you were probably a bit up tight because you hadn't used one before.  You really need to relax before inserting the tampon, the muscles in the vaginal area are very strong.  Try lying on the bed with your knees bent and use one of the tampons with the applicator until you get used to it.<br>  Make sure you use a small size tampon to start with as well and that you have a heavy enough period so that you are not too dry to get it in.<br>  It is a real trial and error, my daughter will not use them at all, she says she has never been comfortable with them and she even has her first child on the way.  There are quite a lot of women who won't use them at all.<br>  Besides, it is now known that they make your period heavier.<br>  Just remember to relax and you will be fine.|`|RbsfzobNaa	ok, well first put your thumb and middle fingers on the grip spot, then find the hole and relax. slowly slide it in until your fingers are right next to your skin.  then use your pointer finger to push it in.<br>  <br>  it will feel uncomfortable until you get used them. make sure you dont leave them in too long though.  if you need more help, you can email me or whatever
80f1e97de0755ea89209abd5c5bb6c91aa	TSS is a rare condition caused by bacteria. It can be contracted several ways (Dirty hands, Birth Control Sponge, and surgical wounds), not just by using tampons. You can reduce your risk of TSS by using the lowest absorbency needed and changing them every 4-8 hours,if not more frequently in addition to washing your hands often.|`|AA10661379	Yes. My cousin got toxic shock syndrome when a tiny piece of her tampon tore off without her knowing. It remained in the back of her vagina for several weeks, collecting bacteria until it made her so ill that the doctors said if she hadn't come in within the next four days, the infection would have been untreatable.<br>  <br>  At the same time, my mother once left a tampon in, unknowingly, for almost two weeks! She did not get ill.<br>  <br>  If you think you may have it, go to the doctor right away!  TSS is a Staphylococcus infection, which means that it is curable. However, there are some strains of the Staph. bacteria that do not respond to certain antibiotics, and the earlier it's caught then the better chance one has of finding the correct treatment. Good luck.
be7bf58d0121045dd3f1574dc9cfc31caa	The best way to work your lower abs is crunches. Lie on the floor, elevate your legs on something like a chair (this takes stress off your back) then suck your abs in as you perform the crunch. Do not keep your back straight. Instead, try to curl up like a snail. Also, crunches should not be performed every day. That will make your abs larger. Perform crunches every other day.<br>  <br>  As far as losing a few pounds, you are on the right track. A healthy diet. In addition to this, you should engage in cardiovascular workouts every day.

JOtuYmghaa	Her mother is going to be protective, just like you would be with your sons. But, the mother should not be allowing the daughter to curse at you no matter what she is going through. There isn't any discipline because the mother is too afraid that she is the reason that her daughter has problems. Maybe she is, maybe she isn't, but she isn't helping. This girl probably needs some help from a professional with her OCD. I wonder if she's on any medications or if she attends any therapy for treatments if medication isn't an option. I think that you should start thinking for you and your sons. It's obvious that you and her mother are going to have issues and if her mother wants to be defensive and take care of her daughter when she needs and and forget everyone else, then maybe you should treat it as such and go somewhere with your children. If you choose to stay, you two have alot to discuss. And she is responsible with you to make sure that you two have the understanding that you both are the adults and the children aren't if they aren't, or that you are the sole providers so things are going to go the way you say they go. The main point is that the daughter needs help getting her OCD controlled a bit. I know she can't totally control it, but there are people out there who work together with an individual that has this disorder, you all need to get to that point, even if it means some counseling or researching it online and trying different techniques. I'm hoping for the best for you. Good luck.|`|f786630d9e978fbe1d1327a250c0621daa	Let me tell you something: you′re not just marrying this woman, but her daughter too.

AA11721824	If you cannot afford PT now, you will have to afford surgery later.  I understand that it can be an expensive but you will do more damage to your shoulder by performing inappropriate exercises or doing nothing at all than paying for a few PT sessions.  <br>  <br>  First, verify exactly how much you will have to pay for PT.  Although you cannot ethically be given a discount for being self-pay, a PT may limit the charges by not using modalities and provide only the necessary treatment.  <br>  <br>  Second, tell the PT when you schedule your appointment that you cannot afford to have several sessions and your goal is to get a comprehensive home exercise program.  You may only need one visit - the PT can perform the initial evaluation and recommend the appropriate exercises specific to your condition.  You may opt for a follow up visit in a few weeks to monitor changes and progress your exercises.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, avoid excessive shoulder abduction and external rotation (the most common mechanism of injury for shoulder dislocations).|`|etFNtGJ7aa	Try helium.com-health&fitness/exercise, "how to repair old injuries..." good luck|`|33c659bc46a017aa1d556f2089d07ec7aa	SWIMMING|`|Rff77L23aa	It would be in your best interest to find PT out there that is cheap.

There are two generally accepted ways, one using both hands, with one hand holding the top lid and the other holding the bottom lid. The hand holding the bottom lid open will have the contact and insert it into the eye. Another option is to have one hand hold the bottom lid down, look away and then insert the contact with the other hand.<br>  It is difficult when you first start doing it because your eyes natural instinct is to try to blink when something is coming at it, but after time the process becomes easier and you stop thinking about it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|z1h2mZfkaa	im not quite sure myself but i help my sister put hers on..i just slide it in on her cornea part of her eye,until she can blink and it matches her eye to look natural...its not that hard,and dont worry u will get use to them,in my oppinon they look better then glasses and feel better then them too...

Someone being treated for heroin addiction via methadone maintenance will most certainly experience withdrawal symptoms if they attempt to stop use abruptly. Methadone addiction, when it is prescribed for pain management, can occur and symptoms would most likely be a need and desire to take increasing amounts of the drug over time, diminished effectiveness of pain control at the prescribed dose and the withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of use that is characteristic of the opiates.|`|pjGpgDtxaa	Methadone is used 2 treat herion or morphine addicts.It's just substituting 1 problem 4 another.If they have 2 have it everyday.Or,it doesn't make'm sick anymore.They culd very well b addicted.I've did herion & morphine.It's all very addictive.I hope yur friend gets better.

bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	Pela própria anatomia, amiga. A mulher é dopositária do esperma e é nele que vêm bactérias, fungos e vírus. Já para esses mesmos microorganismos penetrarem no corpo do homem, precisam "remar contra a maré", por assim dizer. Além disso, a mulher normalmente possui secre??es vaginais devido à umidade natural ou alguma pequena inflama??o que tenha. Dessa forma, fica difícil identificar de imediato uma secre??o por DST, o que é diferente do homem, que n?o tem secre??o nenhuma e qualquer uma que apare?a já é sinal de alerta. Por todas essas raz?es, é muito mais importante para a mulher do que para o homem o uso da camisinha. Por isso eles resistem tanto. Além do mais, a mulher tem o dever de exigir o uso da camisinha por que a gravidez é cara e o esperma é barato.

You'd have to make sure that the rope is short enough so that the sitting position is enough to exert the necessary force on the windpipe.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you can commit suicide by hanging while lying down, however.  Sitting, you'd have to stand up to stop the hanging, and by the time your survival reflexes kick in, standing up may not be an option.  However, with lying down you just have to sit up.

0nmrjjXeaa	Here is a shortened version of a basic complete system I came up with for my clients to help with weight loss along with some basic understanding:<br>  Eat six square meals a day, smaller to the proportion you would eat normally so your eating the same amount or just slightly higher or lower.  This opts to obtaining the most metabolic structure for processing for into usable substances rather than sitting in your stomach and being converted to fat.<br>  Watch what you put in and on your food and make sure what you are eating is organic.  No added salts, sugar, no high fructose corn syrup (converts directly to fat instead of being used for energy as regular sugar). No MSG's (stops digestion) the more you do these things the better.  I was eating at McDonalds almost every day for lunch and still lost because of the rest of this.<br>  Eat fresh grape fruit (not juice) before each meal and Oolong tea or Yerba mate (green teat can be supplemented but with less effect) four times a day.<br>  Run first thing in the morning when glycogen is at its lowest stores, before you drink or eat anything.  Start the day with 10 oz. of room temp. Distilled water.  Drink distilled water throughout the day (distilled water does not have chlorine or fluoride of which shuts down digestion and is bad for electrolyte balance and parasite defense.)<br>  Eat your largest meal with most fat content before the most active part of your day, (usually morning before work, unless at an office job).<br>  Don't eat two hours before bed. Consume fax seed oil and caisine protein directly before sleep. (Caisine is the slower digestive protein that will last all night to heal from the day.  Found in nuts, peanut butter, certain protein shakes, or 4 oz. fat free milk would work as well)<br>  Low carb. Protein before work out, high carb snack or drink while working out and sugar protein directly after (insulin receptors are creating an anabolic effect for first 20 minutes after a hard workout and will use sugar as a healing regiment.<br>  These are the basics without going into a book about the body and functions of anabolic, catabolic and metabolic structures and how each receptor and hormonal diversities consolidate with each other.<br>  I'm sure you have also heard muscle burns fat, which is true, but muscle also adds pounds which is why most dieting structures don't say to gain muscle and they are actually having you lose muscle while losing the fat, because they care about you seeing the results so you'll stick to it.  Which is good for people who need to see the results, but not for those who can wait, cause if you build muscle first, the fat will shed off allot quicker and you'll get toned instead of just thin.  How ever the process will take longer, but will be healthier.<br>  If you would like a more personalized approach a lot more info would be needed.  A lot on the best way to achieve your goal is on a psychological level of what you can handle and what you need to see to keep yourself motivated.  Which is why a good personal trainer that knows what they're doing and that can really get in side your head would be helpful.  It's too bad there aren't many around.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	The basics are the best: vegetables, lean meats and proteins, healthy fats in small portions, some fruit, some dairy products, and complex carbs.|`|rgZTfjMGaa	Eat only raw foods, go vegan.... eat organic.

If you do, your weight will go nowhere.|`|3EgdqjlJaa	More times then not if you start a diet you will fail it simply because it puts more constrictions on you and you will not be able to take it for long. Yes some show results fast but warning once you fall off it will come back and add more to it as well. In saying this i will tell you the simplest way to lose the weight you want to is to try and cut out as much trans fat as possible.(processed foods, fast food,and sweet goodies.) realisticly we can not stay away from these things forever, we all love these things to much but the trick is is not to go over board once you do have something like that. Most women think that once they cheat that the whole day is ruined and they continue to eat bad choices. My favorite kind of dieting is not dieting at all its a healthy lifestyle choice. I eat lots of fruits and vegitable, i eat only lean grilled meats (i would stay away from pork as much as possible.), low fat dairy. Drink as much water as you can possibly stand because it helps flush out the water the body stores, it also flushes out fat. You do need to exercise but please pick an activity that you love, it makes it so much more fun and you are more likely to stick to it. Just being active is healthy for you, no pushing yourself it will only burn you out. If you have that gooey piece of chocalate cake don't hate yourself just keep eating those healthy foods and in the long road your chocalate fix won't matter much. As long as you realize a piece as big as your head is NOT a good idea. Try to not have that every day but more like once a week.

Trying those dumb diets out of books or off tv aren't effective and normally the weight will come back.  The best and most effective way is to do what I said above.  <br>    *Don't eat junk food and no fast food.  Normally I would say go ahead once and awhile, but you're trying to lose this fast so if I were you, I would avoid that completely.  Even if it's a salad from a drive through.  A lot of the time, the salad has more fat than a burger would.<br>    *Eat healthy portions.  Many people have a problem of eating even after they're full.  Even if the food is really good, if you're full, STOP EATING.  Just keep in mind that body you want for this summer =]  Also by keeping yourself busy with new hobbies or working out, you won't be so bored.  And when you're bored, you eat.  So instead of that, go workout.<br>    *Be active.  Make it a daily routine to go to the gym or workout at home.  If you really want to get in shape, you will have the motivation to do this.  If you're not the kind of girl who enjoys working out, get with a friend!  It's always way easier to workout and work hard if you have someone with you who will workout with you and support you.  So make sure you have someone who will really support what you're doing.<br>    *Keep doing this until you reach the body you want and be super consistant.  But even once you're where you want to be, keep working out and keep eating healthy or you will gain the weight right back.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Have Fun This Summer =]|`|2p8pgAhqaa	Dont skip meals!!

9nElIoMiaa	I don't think age has much to do with it .. at 35 age will have little bearing on the consequences of the procedure.<br>  <br>  Usually in a vasectomy the doctor "snips" and then "ties" both cords (one cord leading from each testicle). To reverse a vasectomy the doctor needs to rejoin the previously snipped cords by microsurgery (perhaps at least one of them). Sometimes this isn't possible.<br>  <br>  Also, just as it takes time for all of the living sperm to be expelled from the body after a vasectomy.. it takes time to produce viable sperm after a reversal.

AA11040867	Flatulence occurs when a food does not break down completely in the stomach and small intestine. As a result, the food makes it into the large intestine in an undigested state. For example, if you are "lactose intolerant," it means that you lack an enzyme (lactase) in your intestine -- the enzyme that breaks lactose apart into two sugar molecules so they can enter the bloodstream. Without lactase, lactose passes undigested through the stomach and small intestine and arrives in the large intestine. <br>  <br>  There, the lactose meets up with billions of hungry bacteria -- the natural "intestinal fauna" we all have in our large intestine. These bacteria are happy to digest lactose. They produce a variety of gases, in much the way that yeast produces carbon dioxide to leaven bread (see How Bread Works for details on yeast). Gases such as methane, hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide are common gases that these bacteria produce. Hydrogen sulfide is the source of the odor we associate with flatulence. <br>  <br>  Certain foods produce more flatulence than others because they contain more indigestible carbohydrates than others. Beans, as you might expect, are particularly well-endowed in this regard.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Usually it means your digestive flora are out of whack. Eating lots of yogurt with live active cultures or taking acidophillus capsules daily will help with that.
AA10041986	From a sleep hygiene standpoint, yes. Part of your circadian rhythym is tied to your core body temperature. The body slowly declines in body temerature in the evening hitting a low point around 3AM. That temperature decline aids in your proper sleep pattern. Humans are naturally night sleepers (thus the problems shift work people have). The body temperature rises through the morning and then takes a slight dip in the afternoon (this is why we get tired just after lunch, it has little to do with the fact that you just ate, its natural for us to nap in the afternoons...many cultures use this even in the workplace). When you work out, you raise your body temperature. If you do it right before you intend to sleep, it can throw off your normal sleep pattern, causing you to sleep poorly and even keep you from getting to sleep in some cases. It is always best to work out at least a couple hours before your normal bedtime.|`|HH3dlNvMaa	yes! after working out sleep is essential because you get tired and a good night sleep is a smart choice. when you are sleeping you'r body is recovering from the exhaustion.

AA10661379	Absolutely not!<br>  <br>  The concern of most new vegetarians is that it is difficult to obtain all necessary amino acids from protein. A lot of the literature suggests that only meat provides all 9 amino acids... not true! It's easy to obtain all of them if you eat a varied diet. Just as an example, my boyfriend is a long-time vegetarian. He was very thin, about 135 lbs, 5'6, but he could bench press 210lbs.<br>  <br>  I don't body-build myself, but my personal best body composition was achieved only after I became a vegetarian (116 lbs., 5'2, but only 17% body fat with tricep skin folds of 10-11 mm.)<br>  <br>  Below is a reference on how to combine protein for best results. Good luck!|`|b126f35e1aff734a7d771c0d4c9991cdaa	It depends on how vegetarian. There are many ways to get proteins. Eggs, milk, almonds, beans, fish, protein shakes and supplements.
tBGLOg5Maa	depends, it's hard to answer this question without more information. Does this happen only after you workout? Does it happen at certain times of your cycle more than others?  Do you have any other symptoms, such as itching or pain/burning?  I used to have a lot of discharge and found out it was yeast related. Generally if it's white, that's what it is. Especially if it's happening after you work out, because this will increase the dampness inside your body and make it a more ideal place for yeasts to grow.  If you've been tested for everything else and you're clear, then it's probably a yeast infection, depending on consistency (if it's pretty thick, it's more likely to be yeast). Are you on a birth control pill? Sometimes that can encourage yeast growth. Also eating a diet high in sugar, alcohol and bread can encourage it. Whatever you do, it's probably best to get advice from a doctor. Just be aware that if the problem is yeast related and you take a typical course of anti-yeast meds, they will probably not get rid of the problem permanently unless you go on an anti-candida diet for a while. Also, the supplement Candex have been really helpful for me as the enzymes digest excess yeast.|`|16gsWinwaa	All women get this. Its normal. Dont freak out.

I'm your same height and over 80 pounds heavier, I've lost 30 pounds so far and hope to be your weight come the end of the year. When you start treating your body well, it will treat you well too. Don't skip meals, make smart food choices - you'll have energy out the roof and you'll feel amazing, I promise you. If you're still feeling uncomfortable with your body, why not just try toning instead of losing weight? Do DVDs at home that will work your abs or your legs, you'll improve your muscles and will remain the same weight, but *look* nicer. Good Luck to you!

No junk food necessary!   :-)|`|AA10010096	Is it possible you're not eating enough? You need enough calories to sustain your body functions as well as all that running you're doing. I would suggest not only keeping track of your weight, but your measurements as well - because, as you said, you may be losing fat and gaining muscle. Muscle looks a whole lot nicer!|`|18189626958d7dd1e25bd4e0832021baaa	OK I had this problem to I had a roll on my stomach so I stated doing crunches every day about 200 now I have a six pack

AA11909406	My first question is why do you have to take Advil every 4 hours? Do you suffer chronic pain or headaches? If so, I would recommend getting that problem looked at by a doctor before worry about Advil and food.<br>  <br>  You don't have to eat when taking Advil, unless you want to keep your stomach lining intact. Long term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will take a toll on your system.<br>  <br>  Ulcers and kidney problems are NOT fun.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	You do not have to eat when you take Advil unless Advil upsets your stomach.

Personal trainers for people in hollywood make really good money, but the average trainer at a gym generally doesnt make that much.|`|aadbc672ff509652b97f6931f5913dbaaa	I am in Australia. Personal trainers at my gym earn between $80 and $90 per hour. Full time would be say 40hrs per week. They work in the gym but are self employed so they have to also pay insurance and rent to the gym. Don't forget there would be extra hours setting programs and planning each session as well as time spent on first consultation wich is usually free and one chance the trainer gets to sell his or her service.|`|19e06314f56c7545b6096d395ec76711aa	Entry level gym salaries are pretty bad.  The real money starts when you build up enough clients to start your own business.  Salaries also vary dramatically by region with CA, NY, FL having the highest rates.

Na sua idade é muito difícil ser problemas hormonais ou fisiológicos.<br>  Pra te ser sincero, acho que você falhou somente uma vez e recorreu ao medicamento e se tornou dependente psicológico do medicamento, recupere sua seguran?a, isso acontece com todo mundo, aconteceu comigo, e se eu contar a minha história pra algum cineasta é bem capaz que eu ganhe um oscar.<br>  A sua parceira tem uma parcela significante na sua recupera??o, se você puder visitar um sexólogo junto com sua parceira seria a melhor solu??o.<br>  Boa sorte, um abra?o!|`|2Poq00spaa	Tratamento do Transtorno de Ere??o<br>  <br>  O tratamento da Disfun??o Erétil exige, em primeiro lugar, melhor esclarecimento de diagnóstico possível, portanto, caso a iniciativa de tratamento seja de um urologista, ele deverá contar, preferentemente, com a colabora??o de um psiquiatra e, contrariamente, na psiquiatria o assessoramento de um urologista é indispensável. Essa é uma forma razoável e sensata para avaliar com maior precis?o os eventuais fatores envolvidos na Disfun??o Erétil.<br>  <br>  A integra??o urológica-psiquiátrica tem por objetivo principal uma melhor distin??o entre os casos de origem organica dos casos psicológicos, distin??o esta fundamental para determinar os diferentes tratamentos.<br>  <br>  Além disso, como vimos no capítulo sobre a descri??o da Disfun??o Erétil, o componente emocional sempre está presente nos casos de Disfun??o Erétil; seja como causa ou conseqüência do transtorno. A abordagem psiquiátrica também é útil para os pacientes e suas c?njuges superarem a o conflito e aceitarem melhor os tratamentos médicos.<br>  <br>  Pelas características próprias de cada especialidade, a urologia focaliza prioritariamente o pênis, sua fisiopatologia e funcionalidade. O interesse diagnóstico e terapêutico da urologia na Disfun??o Erétil focaliza claramente o órg?o final e, certamente, o interesse n?o prioriza a quest?o emocional e psíquica. Estes últimos s?o melhor abordados pela psiquiatria.<br>  <br>   A psiquiatria também pode contribuir para a abordagem do relacionamento do homem impotente com a sua companheira, abordagem dos conflitos e ansiedades comprometedoras da fun??o sexual.<br>  <br>  Muito embora as recentes e grandes descobertas científicas de novos tratamentos para o pênis estimulem algumas pessoas a afirmar que a disfun??o erétil é quase sempre de etiologia organica, essas declara??es n?o se baseiam em estudos populacionais e acabam carecendo de consciência científica.<br>  <br>  A impotência psicogênica n?o envolve apenas o aumento do tono adrenérgico nos corpos cavernosos, mas sabemos que existe uma via fisiopatológica final que se resume na incapacidade neuroquímica adrenérgica de enviar ou manter sangue nos corpos cavernosos gerando a Disfun??o Erétil.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Procure um médico que ele certament poderá te ajudar.<br>  Algumas dicas. Vc é muito novo e ainda n?o conseguiu controlar a ere??o por muito tempo e isto é normal quando esta com alguém porque vc deve estar ficando tenso e ansioso. Muito do sexo prazeiroso vem da mente e portanto afastados problemas hormonais, vc tem que cuidar da mente também. Acho pouco provavel que na sua idade a causa seja hormonal. Vc teve uma puberdade normal, pelos crescimento normal do penis? Se sim, vc está apto para ter sexo bom.<br>  Agora pense que TUDO na vida exige um pouco de treino e concentra??o como um esporte. Lembre-se se vc ficar tenso aí tudo sairá errado. Vá treinando sozinho que an hora H vc estará muito bem ...′′e só descontrair. <br>  Outro dia eu vi um filme que eu esqueci o nome ,mas o cara fica treinando com uma amiga e ia muito bem mas ficava super nervoso com aquela que supostamente ele gostava...acabou gostando da amiga.e esqueceu a outra..rs<br>  abs|`|0810ff29a2cb87ea0a41fc851ab35bd6aa	N?o sou médico, porem, tenho uma opini?o bem prática sobre este assunto.

I have this happen to me almost all of the time. It's just your body reacting while your having sex. It just happens to come out a little thicker. Mine is always thick like this unless I'm very close to coming on my period. At that time it's a lot more clearer and shiny looking, but yeah for the most part I'm the same way too. Don't listen to the first girl who told you this means your not fertile. That's a lie and she doesn't know what she's talking about. You don't need to see anyone about this because it's normal.

Tenho um dentista show de bola que só trabalha com o móvel. Este negócio de fixo é a coisa mais ultrapassada que existe.<br>  3. Meu filho consultou vários dentistas, eles disseram que teria que ser arrancado 4 dentes...eu disse NAO. Levei a este dentista show e em seis meses os caninos do meu filho estavam na posi??o ok e eles nunca mais se desalinharam.<br>  4.

Geralmente a indica??o do uso varia de 3 a 5 anos, mas durante esses tempo o dentista deverá te acompanhar para ir ajustando ou "afrouxando" o aparelho móvel para melhor adapta??o,  porque depois de tirado o fixo os dentes sofrem pequenas altera??es devido a influencias dos músculo bucais, língua, respira??o etc... e se ajustar?o de forma harmonioza.<br>   Como seu aparelho n?o encaixou n?o force a melhor coisa é leva-lo até seu ortodontista para ele avaliar a situa??o ( ele poderá ajusta-lo ou pedir para confeccionar outro). Qto ao seu medo de ter que usar novamente o fixo só será necessário caso tenha algum dente que tenha saido da posi??o caso contrário n?o será necessário.

icIcl3Traa	As hemorróidas s?o constituídas pela dilata??o excessiva de veias normalmente existentes em volta do anus – as hemorróidas externas – e no interior do canal anal – as hemorróidas internas.<br>  <br>  S?o causadas por altera??es estruturais de suas paredes como diminui??o das fibras musculares, em que se acredita haver influência hereditária, tornando-as mais fracas e susceptíveis de se dilatarem, quando condi??es que aumentam a press?o hidrostática em seu interior se fizerem presentes como esfor?os repetidos e a gravidez.<br>  <br>  Sua manifesta??o mais importante é o sangramento durante a evacua??o que, em geral, é de pequena monta e de sangue “vivo”. Contrariamente ao conceito popular, é um processo indolor, salvo em situa??es de trombose, complica??o em que o sangue coagula dentro de suas veias. Na grande maioria das vezes, a dor na regi?o anal n?o é causada por hemorróidas, mas devida a outras causas<br>  N?o existem hemorróidas em crian?as. Suas manifesta??es come?am na adolescência. Nos indivíduos mais velhos, a grande preocupa??o deve ser sempre com o diagnóstico diferencial com tumores do intestino, uma vez que ambas as situa??es transcorrem, em geral, com sangramentos e sem dor. <br>  <br>  Nos indivíduos pertencentes a grupos de risco para tumores, a constata??o de hemorróidas n?o deve encerrar o processo de investiga??o pela possibilidade da existência concomitante de ambas as patologias.<br>  <br>  O tratamento das hemorróidas come?a sempre pela regulariza??o do hábito intestinal, com evacua??es fáceis, de pouco esfor?o, associadamente a uma higiene rigorosa com lavagem com água e sabonete. Medidas clínicas como pomadas podem ajudar a reduzir o desconforto de inflama??es locais, quando associadas a anti-inflamatórios sistêmicos. Todavia, tais medidas n?o retiram as hemorróidas, para o que é necessário atitudes terapêuticas mais efetivas, selecionadas após avalia??o do especialista, e que se resumem nas seguintes op??es:<br>  <br>  -Coagula??o com “infra-red”, aparelho tipo laser, que utiliza a luz como fonte de calor para obstruir os vasos sanguíneos que alimentam os mamilos hemorroidários. é o processo que veio substituir a antiga esclerose com inje??es. é feita em consultório, em procedimento que dura alguns minutos.<br>  Ligadura elástica, também feita em consultório e extremamente rápida, consiste em amarrar os mamilos hemorroidários com um pequeno elástico, que terá como conseqüência sua necrose e queda em dois a três dias. <br>  Tratamento cirúrgico convencional, realizado em hospital, é o tratamento mais completo e definitivo.<br>  Perguntas mais comuns feitas ao médico:<br>  <br>  Hemorróida operada volta?<br>  Hemorróida operada n?o volta. Pode ocorrer que, às vezes, o cirurgi?o seja obrigado a deixar pequenas hemorróidas após retirar as principais, sob pena de comprometer a cicatriza??o após a cirurgia. No futuro, estas pequenas hemorróidas podem crescer um pouco, jamais chegando a atingir o tamanho e os inconvenientes das principais, já retiradas.<br>  <br>  Dói muito após a opera??o?<br>  Toda a opera??o se acompanha de desconforto. Em geral, n?o é como as pessoas falam. Este desconforto acontece nos primeiros dias, maior para uns e menor para outros, sendo decrescente com o passar do tempo. Neste intervalo, o paciente estará protegido com analgésicos e outras medidas de pós-operatório.<br>  <br>  Qual o tempo de recupera??o?<br>  O tempo de recupera??o também é variável. Aconselha-se n?o assumir compromissos formais nos primeiros sete a dez dias após a opera??o. A cicatriza??o total acontece em média em trinta dias, podendo o paciente exercer suas atividades normais, com um pequeno curativo, depois de mais ou menos quinze dias.|`|679f0c36233e14c38c5bad08be5f9b3eaa	O mais eficaz é a cirugia.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	o tratamento com pomadas n?o resolve...só o cirurgico...hoje em dia tem uma técnica nova que reduz o tempo de cirurgia, é muito eficaz, e  reduz o incomodo do pós operatório.

gBVG7O2Qaa	I am a social worker so I'll provide you with two reasons. One; females are brought up differently and treated differently than boys. They are tought to be nurturing. Society has a large part to do with this. Also ethnicity, religion, upbringing all are part of this. Girls are treated far more gently than boys. Think about girls that are considered tomboys. They probably had brothers who treated them like one of their own.

Find simple things to cut out of your diet at first. You can't just change your entire diet in one day.

Just make little changes and they will start to add up<br>  2. Start with moderate exercise. You aren't going to turn into a gym rat or athlete overnight. Start walking 20 minutes 3Xs a week and go from there. If there is a sport you like, great - that will make things easier. Can you go to a gym?

Primeiro acredite. Ele corta as unhas dos pes com a m?o direita as unhas do pé esquerdo e com a m?o esquerda as do pé direito e depois coloque as unhas num saquinho e enterre no meio do caule de um mamoeiro e depois nunca mais coma mam?o.<br>  Meu pai dizia que isso curou a erisipela, mas ele n?o tinha diabetes.|`|ayb4CP8laa	Entrevista consedida ao Dr. Draúsio Varella pelo Dr. Carlos Machado que é médico dermatologista e professor na Faculdade de Medicina do ABC (S?o Paulo). <br>  <br>  Erisipela<br>  <br>  Erisipela é uma infec??o provocada quando bactérias encontram uma porta de entrada nas camadas mais superficiais da pele e espalham-se formando uma mancha vermelha, quente e dolorosa. Calor, rubor e dor s?o três sintomas de inflama??o que a medicina conhece há muito tempo e que se manifestam também na erisipela.<br>  Dentro do organismo, a prolifera??o das bactérias faz com que sejam liberadas toxinas que v?o provocar febre, dor de cabe?a, mal-estar.<br>  Normalmente, as les?es aparecem mais nas pernas e nos pés, embora possam manifestar-se também na face. <br>  O tratamento da erisipela precisa ser seguido criteriosamente para evitar crises de repeti??o que podem ter conseqüências graves. <br>  Regi?o mais afetada<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Em que regi?o do corpo costumam surgir os casos de erisipela?<br>  Carlos Machado – Atualmente, em cerca de 70%, 80% dos casos, a regi?o do corpo mais afetada s?o os membros inferiores, as pernas. No passado, a face era o local mais acometido.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Os livros de medicina mais antigos registravam que a face era o local preferido pela erisipela. A prática, porém, mostrava que a erisipela é mais comum nos membros inferiores. Por que no passado a doen?a acometia mais a face? <br>  Carlos Machado – N?o saberia dizer exatamente o porquê. No entanto, n?o há dúvida de que qualquer perda na continuidade da barreira da pele ou da mucosa pode ser porta de entrada para a erisipela e que, hoje, as erisipelas de face est?o com muita freqüência associadas, por exemplo, à seborréia, uma irrita??o comum que afeta o couro cabeludo e regi?es da face, como o sulco nasogeniano e ao redor do ouvido, provocando descama??o e prurido. Unhas contaminadas em portadores de dermatite seborréica (caspa) s?o uma das causas mais importantes da erisipela na face nos nossos dias. <br>  Os textos de medicina antigos diziam que essa era a localiza??o preferida da doen?a. Como a orofaringe, a garganta, as vias aéreas superiores, os seios da face e os dentes podem ser portas de entrada para bactérias, talvez a higiene bucal extremamente precária naquele tempo pudesse justificar a prevalência da doen?a nessa regi?o do corpo. Mesmo assim me parece estranho, porque os fatores que determinam a maior incidência nos membros inferiores, provavelmente eram os mesmos daquela época: micoses de pele, pés de atleta, diabetes descompensada, obesidade.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Fatores esses acrescidos pelos ferimentos constantes nos pés que a falta de cal?ados adequados e a vida rural propiciavam.<br>  Carlos Machado – Na verdade, n?o faz muito sentido o que os livros antigos descrevem a respeito da regi?o do corpo mais acometida pela erisipela.<br>  Características da doen?a<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Em termos bem simples, você poderia dar uma idéia da fisiopatologia da doen?a?<br>  Carlos Machado – A erisipela geralmente é causada por um tipo comum de bactéria, o estreptococo. Toda vez que há perda da barreira da pele, isto é, toda vez que a pele se rompe por algum motivo, o estreptococo pode penetrar e provocar uma infec??o superficial acompanhada de vermelhid?o e calor e que rapidamente afeta os vasos linfáticos existentes na segunda camada da pele.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – As bactérias migram para os vasos linfáticos e provocam uma rea??o inflamatória que caracteriza a erisipela. Que outras características tem a doen?a?<br>  Carlos Machado – Uma das características principais é a les?o ter limites muito precisos, ou seja, forma-se uma placa com bordas bem nítidas que vai avan?ando e se diferencia muito da pele normal.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Erisipela aparecendo em vários pontos do membro inferior é muito raro. Em geral, elas se formam ao redor de um ponto determinado.<br>  Carlos Machado - Come?am a formar-se ao redor do ponto por onde o germe penetrou. Evidentemente, à medida que ele vai se multiplicando, o sistema de defesa tenta destruí-los, mas o organismo perde essa briga e a mancha vermelha se espalha. Por isso, um dos sinais que se utilizam para diferenciar a erisipela de outras infec??es das partes moles ou da pele é a existência de focos múltiplos ou a les?o atingir as duas pernas ou outras partes do corpo. Caso isso aconte?a, é sinal de outra infec??o que n?o a erisipela.<br>  Sintomas<br>  <br>  Drauzio - A bactéria penetra na pele, migra pelos vasos linfáticos, provoca uma rea??o inflamatória e surge uma mancha avermelhada com limites precisos que vai progressivamente crescendo. O que a pessoa sente a partir do momento em que se instala a doen?a até as fases mais avan?adas? <br>  Carlos Machado – Erisipela é uma infec??o bacteriana normalmente ocasionada pelo estreptococo, raramente pelo estafilococo. Essas bactérias produzem muitas toxinas que s?o rapidamente absorvidas porque a infec??o atinge o interior dos vasos e provoca rea??es como tremores, mal-estar, náusea, v?mitos, enj?o, febre alta. Esses sintomas podem instalar-se precocemente, antes mesmo de a erisipela alcan?ar grandes propor??es. A sintomatologia geral faz parte do quadro e é importante, às vezes, para diferenciar clinicamente a erisipela de outras infec??es.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Qual o primeiro sintoma: vermelhid?o ou febre e mal-estar?<br>  Carlos Machado – Em geral, tudo come?a com um traumatismo muito pequeno. Pode ser uma picada de inseto, uma pequena erup??o avermelhada ao redor do pé de atleta, um ferimento também pequeno, mas isentos de mal-estar ou qualquer outro sintoma. Eles só ir?o manifestar-se se houver tempo de a pequena popula??o bacteriana que entrou pela les?o da pele multiplicar-se e produzir quantidade razoável de toxinas. <br>  A erisipela n?o é um fen?meno imunológico. é um fen?meno tóxico que provoca os sintomas já descritos.<br>  Evolu??o<br>  <br>  Drauzio – A partir do momento que come?a a infec??o local até surgirem sintomas como febre e prostra??o, quantos dias leva em média?<br>  Carlos Machado – Em média, de três a sete dias, mas existem varia??es no quadro clínico. Em 80% dos casos, é possível determinar por onde o germe penetrou, mas nos outros n?o se consegue encontrar sua porta de entrada.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Existe sempre uma porta de entrada?<br>  Carlos Machado – Nos indivíduos imunossuprimidos, extremamente depauperados e desnutridos, existe a possibilidade de dissemina??o endógena. Por exemplo, em paciente com cancer de cólon em fase avan?ada pode acontecer de o germe penetrar pela mucosa intestinal e provocar um quadro de erisipela nos genitais, mas esse é um quadro raríssimo.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Por que a erisipela costuma acometer os membros inferiores?<br>  Carlos Machado – A grande maioria das erisipelas ocorre nos membros inferiores e está associada às micoses interdigitais, aos pés de atleta, ou onicomicoses, e às micoses de unha. As fissuras que se formam nos v?os dos dedos dos pés s?o as portas de entrada campe?s para as bactérias que provocam a doen?a. <br>  é evidente que nem todas as pessoas que têm pé de atleta v?o desenvolver erisipela. Existem alguns fatores facilitadores para o aparecimento da doen?a. <br>  Fatores de risco<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Quais s?o esses fatores facilitadores da erisipela?<br>  Carlos Machado – Diabetes n?o compensado é, estourado, o principal fator, seguido da obesidade e da insuficiência venosa que normalmente se manifesta nos obesos. Em geral, correm maior risco pessoas com tendência a varizes, cardiopatas e nefropatas, que acordam com as pernas desinchadas, mas no final do dia apresentam pernas volumosas, duras por causa do líquido retido. A estase dos membros inferiores favorece muito a instala??o da erisipela porque, se a circula??o dos pequenos vasos n?o estiver adequada, transforma-se num meio de cultura importante para a prolifera??o de bactérias.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Pessoas com varizes est?o mais sujeitas à erisipela?<br>  Carlos Machado – Est?o mais sujeitas, especialmente quando as varizes est?o associadas a úlceras, pois além da circula??o comprometida têm uma porta constantemente aberta para os germes penetrarem. A tendência é essas pessoas fazerem erisipela de repeti??o - que danificam os vasos linfáticos e condicionam um edema maior - e entrarem num círculo vicioso típico da doen?a: erisipela, insuficiência venosa com úlcera, obesidade, insuficiência cardíaca e renal, outra crise de erisipela .<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Que outro grupo está mais sujeito a desenvolver erisipela?<br>  Carlos Machado – Os imunossuprimidos submetidos a longos tratamentos ou com doen?as cr?nicas muito debilitantes, em geral, têm erisipela nos membros inferiores.<br>  Quanto aos imunossuprimidos, existe sempre um fator a mais predisponente, por exemplo, diabetes, incha?o nas pernas ou ferimento que funcionou como porta de entrada para as bactérias.<br>  Pés dos diabéticos<br>  <br>  Drauzio –Diabetes tem sido citado freqüentemente como fator predisponente para a erisipela. Diabéticos, além da obesidade que é um problema freqüente entre eles, apresentam a neuropatia diabética, ou seja, as termina??es nervosas v?o ficando com dificuldade de transmitir os estímulos e eles perdem parte da sensibilidade dos pés, o que os torna mais susceptíveis a ferimentos e infec??es. Que cuidados especiais os diabéticos devem tomar com os pés? <br>  Carlos Machado – Todo o diabético, compensado ou n?o, deve cuidar muito bem dos pés. Os cuidados devem come?ar pelo cal?ado. é preciso abrir m?o do estilo e pensar no conforto. Sapatos de bico fino, salto alto, que comprimam de alguma forma os pés devem ser descartados porque os portadores de diabetes perdem a sensibilidade nessa regi?o. Calosidades chamadas de mal perfurante, que formam feridas de difícil cicatriza??o na planta do pé, s?o portas abertas para a erisipela.<br>  é preciso vigiar constantemente os pés. Se a pessoa n?o consegue fazer isso sozinha, deve pedir ajuda. Como diabéticos n?o sentem dor, pelo menos uma vez por semana, devem examinar entre os dedos para ver se n?o há sinal de micose e se n?o est?o se formando calosidades que podem transformar-se em úlceras difíceis de cicatrizar. <br>  Diagnóstico<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Você recebe um paciente queixando-se de febre alta, dor de cabe?a, astenia, dor numa regi?o da perna. Você examina e encontra a mancha avermelhada com limites precisos, quente. Esses dados clínicos s?o suficientes para estabelecer o diagnóstico de erisipela? <br>  Carlos Machado – A maior parte dos diagnósticos costuma ser clínico, mas nada em medicina é definitivo. Nas enfermarias, pode-se recorrer à biopsia, quando há dúvida. Só em 20% dos casos, porém, é possível recuperar o germe no local da les?o, porque existem poucas bactérias ali e o fen?meno é mais devido à libera??o de toxinas.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Na maioria das vezes, colhe-se o material, mas n?o encontramos bactérias no exame microscópico...<br>  Carlos Machado – Em situa??es como essa, um recurso que se usa em enfermaria é injetar 2cc de soro fisiológico na borda da erisipela e aspirar. Isso aumenta quase em 80% a possibilidade de obter o germe responsável pela infec??o. Pode-se também realizar a biópsia e mandar fazer cultura, mas esses n?o s?o procedimentos de rotina. Só s?o realizados quando há grande dificuldade de diagnóstico, o que n?o acontece na maioria dos casos. <br>  Tratamento<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Feito o diagnóstico, como se encaminha o tratamento?<br>  Carlos Machado – Se o indivíduo for hígido e a erisipela simples e inicial, a prescri??o de antibióticos por via oral, repouso e eleva??o do membro acometido creio que sejam medidas suficientes.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Quantos dias de antibiótico s?o necessários?<br>  Carlos Machado – Na fase aguda, pelo menos duas semanas de antibiótico por via oral. Se n?o houver outro comemorativo complicador, esse esquema costuma ser suficiente. Caso contrário, estica-se um pouco mais o prazo.<br>  Em geral, penicilina ministrada por via intramuscular provoca resposta mais rápida, mas é um pouco difícil indicar esse tipo de tratamento porque tem de ser feito em pronto-socorro ou hospital, ao contrário do que acontecia antigamente quando a inje??o podia ser aplicada nas farmácias.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Esquemas de cinco dias, uma semana s?o desaconselháveis para o tratamento da erisipela?<br>  Carlos Machado – S?o desaconselháveis, como provam as recidivas freqüentes nesse esquema de tratamento.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Estabelecida a antibioticoterapia adequada, em quanto tempo costumam desaparecer os sintomas e a mancha vermelha come?a a regredir?<br>  Carlos Machado – Se o germe tiver a sensibilidade que se imagina, n?o demorará muito. Em torno de três ou quatro dias, a febre cai e há alívio da dor. Com uma semana de tratamento, o paciente já estará se sentindo bem melhor.<br>  Todavia, dependendo da intensidade do edema, o quadro pode demorar até um mês para regredir e a resposta é diferente se for a primeira crise ou uma erisipela de repeti??o. Existem casos mais complicados. Indivíduos com úlceras na perna que mantêm o foco aberto podem exigir manuten??o do tratamento por tempo indeterminado porque erisipelas de repeti??o podem tornar-se um problema grave de saúde.<br>  Casos especiais<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Gostaria que você abordasse o caso das mulheres mastectomizadas, que retiraram a mama e os ganglios debaixo do bra?o e ficam com edema no membro superior.<br>  Carlos Machado – Tenho visto pouca erisipela pós-mastectomia. Acho que as técnicas cirúrgicas mais modernas têm colaborado para reduzir o número dos casos. No entanto, indivíduos que fazem pontes de safena, podem ficar com edema residual na perna de onde foi retirada a safena, edema que compromete a circula??o linfática e transforma-se num fator predisponente para a erisipela desde que o tratamento n?o seja bem conduzido.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – O que significa conduzir bem esses edemas?<br>  Carlos Machado – Fisioterapia e compress?o ajudam muito. O uso de meia elástica é fundamental. Protocolo realizado na Faculdade de Medicina do ABC mostrou que as benzopironas s?o medicamentos úteis porque n?o s?o agressivos e diminuem a press?o oncótica do tecido intersticial.<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Como agem esses medicamentos?<br>  Carlos Machado – As benzopironas estimulam os macrófagos, células existentes na pele que têm a capacidade de comer proteínas, uma vez que esses edemas s?o ocasionados por macromoléculas que os vasos linfáticos deveriam absorver. Se eles estiverem obstruídos, como acontece na safenectomia ou na cirurgia de mama com remo??o dos ganglios, cabe aos macrófagos desempenhar essa fun??o, ou seja, comer a proteína que está chupando o líquido para fora dos vasos. <br>  Atualmente, podemos contar com as benzopironas, substancias que estimulam os macrófagos, fazendo diminuir a atra??o do líquido pela pele, o que se traduz em menos incha?o. Trata-se de uma medica??o segura, com pouquíssimos efeitos colaterais, extremamente útil para os indivíduos que perderam os vasos linfáticos. Uma vez que n?o há como repor essa perda, eles precisam de fisioterapia, compress?o e uso de medicamentos para controlar a press?o oncótica.<br>  Erisipela de repeti??o<br>  <br>  Drauzio – Em que casos o antibiótico deve ser mantido por mais tempo?<br>  Carlos Machado – Isso depende da análise global do paciente. Se for a segunda vez que a doen?a se manifesta, mas o paciente é hígido, é possível que n?o tenha tratado adequadamente uma micose na planta dos pés ou nos v?os dos dedos. às vezes, o uso de talco antimicótico basta para resolver o problema de recidiva.<br>  No entanto, quando o paciente é obeso, com úlceras, hipertenso, cardiopata descompensado, tem diabetes e há dificuldade de controlá-lo clinicamente, temos que recorrer à manuten??o do tratamento por mais tempo, porque erisipelas de repeti??o v?o se tornando cada vez mais perigosas e o risco de desenvolver erisipela bolhosa aumenta. <br>  <br>  Drauzio – O que é a erisipela bolhosa?<br>  Carlos Machado – é um tipo mais grave erisipela, mais profundo. Normalmente, a erisipela é superficial e cresce horizontalmente. às vezes, porém, pode crescer em profundidade e afetar a gordura e o músculo, constituindo casos bem mais graves, com toxemia severa. O paciente fica largado na cama.<br>  Em geral, a erisipela bolhosa acomete pacientes imunossuprimidos, com cancer avan?ado, HIV-positivos, diabéticos descompensados, e pode evoluir para exposi??o ou destrui??o do músculo. <br>  Existem, ainda, a fasceíte necrozante, uma forma grave da doen?a que destrói o músculo, e formas genitais como a gangrena de Fournier, descrita há muitos anos, que pode destruir os genitais. <br>  Erisipela é uma infec??o que bem controlada evolui bem. Caso contrário, pode ter graves conseqüências.<br>  <br>  <br>  Att.<br>  Luciano Lopes|`|b913ef5e9dfecbe12b5e7ee803ff66f1aa	Que dureza, heim? Tomara que vc tenha um médico competente!
ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	MDMA (street name: almost always called Ecstasy, Ex, or simply E) is not an anti-depressent, its a dangerous and illegal street drug. If you took Ecstasy every day for depression you would end up much worse then you were before you started taking it. The drug is considered a "psychedelic amphetamine" which means it speeds up your body and even causes mild hallucinations in some people. The MDMA will produce a speedy and euphoric effect that will only last about 2 hours and leave you extremely depressed and unhappy afterwards, you will need increasingly heavier dosages to get the same effect (some people will take many pills at once to get the same effect as one did the first time.) Something else to consider is if the pill you buy even contains MDMA. There are tons of fakes on the market and some contain very dangerous drugs and chemicals (DXM, large doses of caffiene, poisonous substances, perscription medication, allergy medication,etc..) MDMA pills tend to be addictive and very expensive (between 10-30+ US dollars per pill) and often exhaust a users financial means very quickly. There have been studies to show that MDMA and MDA cause permanent brain damage. There have been many deaths related to poison pills, overdoses, dehydration, heat stroke, etc.. Ecstacy is classified as a schedule 1 narcotic in the US, this means it is a felony to buy, posess, use, and sell the substance.<br>  <br>  Legal anti-depressants are made especially for depression as the name implys. However, there are many different types of anti-depressants and they work in different ways. One of the most popular types is a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibiter) it works by causing your brain to produce more serotonin then it was making naturally. This causes the original chemical imbalance to be corrected to normal levels, thus making you feel better. Another popular type is the TCA (Tricyclic)  these inhibit the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin by nerve cells. This also causes a patient to feel better. Both types of medication are safe to take over a prolonged period of time and both take as long as a month to build up in the system enough to cause the intended effect. These drugs should only be taken when perscribed and monitored by a doctor (preferably a psychiatrist) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9c3e765e456d2d4acdba56611843077daa	MDMA is the pure form of ecstacy.  AD's do not contain MDMA or ecstacy.  MDMA increases your heart rate and has hallucinagenic effetcs.

mjPbOCQqaa	Hola Bam<br>  Bueno tal vez la pasaste y no te diste cuenta. A mí me sucedió con la rubeola. Con esto de los embarazos (bueno por si alguna vez quisiera tener hijos) me hice unas pruebas porque no recordaba haberme vacunado (al menos mi madre no lo recordaba) y no sabía si podía pillarla. Así que me hice los análisis y dieron como resultado que tengo anticuerpos, bien por haberme vacunado, aunque mi madre no lo recuerde, bien por haberla pasado sin darme cuenta. Puede ser también tu caso. En cualquier caso, la próxima vez que alguien cercano la contraiga, pégate a esa persona. Si no te contagias, entonces tienes anticuerpos.

AA11412999	The vagina is very elastic and is designed to accomodate a baby's full body.  So unless your partner has a 7-10 lb penis and is missing a brain (as in, doesn't know enough to go slowly and patiently with you), you should be just fine.  Just the same, if it's your first time, using adequate water-based lubricant, a condom, and plenty of foreplay should ease things along.  Breaking the hymen, a thin membrane partially covering the vaginal opening, can sometimes hurt but it's usually short-lived.  When this happens, don't be surprised if you bleed.  This is normal.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, be smart, and play safe.  And be sure that you're sure you want to do it before you do.  You don't want to live life with any regrets. :)|`|05b55ef433c0111585f8abb549c0eba9aa	There really is not a should be "length and diameter".  Every women is different, so just because one women can have a thicker penis, it does not mean that another women(with the same body build of the 1st women) will be able to accommodate that size.  It really is on individual basis.  Since this is your first time, you need to use a condom first of all.  Another thing is to make sure you have a lot of lubricant with you and your partner, so that the penis will slide in easier.

6e833114f8b12def19ff420f77bd1194aa	Please use a backup method of contraception until you call your doctor or pharmacist.<br>  <br>  The 7 day breaks in combined hormonal methods like the pill, patch, and ring allow a woman's hormone levels to decline to allow a withdrawal bleed, which actually allows her natural cycle to return for a brief period. Follicular development begins during the 7 day break, but is usually stopped by restarting hormones before ovulation occurs.<br>  <br>  The most common way hormonal methods fail is by missing pills/going off schedule just before and just after the 7 day break, since this can allow enough follicular development to lead to ovulation.<br>  <br>  So, use a back-up method, and consider obtaining emergency contraception if you've had intercourse.

6de8798c6bf528620ad52ef6ce0d9893aa	Jo Jo is a dirty, dirty spammer.<br>  <br>  For cardio try and work out at 80-85% of your estimated maximal heart rate (220-your age * .8 or .85).  Many machines in the gym have heart rate sensors (ellipticals, bikes, recumbent bikes).  Start out trying to mantain this heartrate for 20 minutes (not counting however long it takes you to get warmed up to your target heart rate or a five minute walking cooldown you chould do at the end)  and then work your way up to sustaining that heart rate fore 25, 30 and up to 35 minutes at a time.<br>  <br>  For weights: Do sets of 10-12 repititions of a relatively light weight and jump from one movement to the next, do a circuit, instead of three sets per each exercise, and allow yourself minimal rest between sets 30-45 seconds (you can allow yourself a longer rest periodically, like upon completion of each circuit).  Many gyms have a machine area designed for circuit work, but you can also set one up in the free weight area if you are creative and it isn't too crowded. <br>  <br>  You can also do little two exercise circuits, like bench press with pushups.

0U7wA5rNaa	If youare looking for permanent weight loss, you are not going to lose 90 pounds in 8 weeks (11.25 pounds per week).  What you can reasonably expect would be ~3 pounds per week.  This is going to be completely dependent, but not limited to, the following:<br>  <br>  --  Beginning weight<br>  --  Body fat percentage<br>  --  Diet<br>  --  Committment to your workout schedule<br>  <br>  To maximize your fat loss (this is where you should focus your energy), I would suggest the following:<br>  <br>  1.  Get your body fat checked by a personal trainer using a caliper pinch test.  Get retested every 3-4 weeks to see your progress.<br>  <br>  2.  Take body measurements now and then again once per week.  Doing this and #1 will show you where the real change is, not so much the numbers on the scale.<br>  <br>  3.  Every evening, write out what and when you are going to eat IN DETAIL.  Do the same with your exercise for the next day.  This take the guess work out of the following day and controls the cravings when you aren't sure what you want to eat.<br>  <br>  4.  Do your cardio in the morning on an empty stomach (water only) as your glycogen levels will be depleted and your body will be forced to metabolize fat from your fat stores for energy.  Look up High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) as this can give your 20 minute HIIT cardio session the effectiveness of a standard 45-60 minute cardio session.  Wait for 45-60 minutes before you eat your breakfast.  Cardio in the morning will help control your apetitie throughout the day as well as gives your metabolism a kick start  first thing in the morning.  Do this every morning for three days and then cross train on the fourth day.<br>  <br>  5.  Plan on 4-6 small meals per day.  The keys here are...<br>  --  equally spaced as much as possible<br>  --  focus on complex/ natural carbs<br>  --  throw fiberous vegetables into at least two of these meals<br>  --  don't forget your body needs good fats (eg: omega 3, 6, 9)<br>  --  taper your carbs where most of your carbs are eaten in the morning and early afternoon.  The exception here is if you are working out in the evening, you will need carbs for your workout.<br>  --  the last meal of the day needs to be about 1-2 hours before you go to bed and be high in protein and low/ no carb and low/ no fat.

For me, I don't get bored by watching TV or listening to music. So I sometimes stand in front of the TV, and do some work-outs. Eating at night is very unhealthy, and all that food will go to fat when you go to sleep. And when you wake up, you'll all be bloated. My mom has this workout video of this Korean supermodel, Sora Lee. Her workouts work really great. Even if you eat, you will still get thin, with muscles. But you cannot eat after 6. I think you can find it somewhere in youtube or veoh, but it on sale in korean video stores. If you can't find it, i know one excercise from the DvD that is effective to your thighs. Spread your legs a little bit and bend your knees halfway. Then hold out your arms in front of you, and go up and down with your legs. But the thing is, don't go all the way up. Go down and go up halfway. Keep doing that for until you feel that you reached your limit. I hope this helps! Remember to eat healthy, excercise a lot, DON'T EAT AFTER 6, and DRINK A LOT OF WATER!

Otherwise you will get dehydrated easily. <br>  <br>  You may also have some underlying problems that have stayed unnoticed.

X3WvVzTXaa	You shouldn't worry about the pregnancy test coming out positive, it takes awhile for the hormones to leave your body completely. You should test positive for a few weeks afterwords even though you aren't pregnant anymore. Of course there is a chance that the abortion wasn't successful, but that is highly unlikely particularly because of the amount of tissue she passed.  <br>  <br>  Taking ib profen would help with the cramps<br>  <br>  Cramping for several days after the abortion is normal. If the cramps are very bad though it would probably be a good idea to call the clinic and see what they say, just to be on the safe side. If it was something serious like a infection she should have other symptoms as well, like a fever. I think everything is probably fine but you could always call the clinic just to be on the safe side.|`|NLi0gTmKaa	I would get her to a clinic fast. That could be a sign that she either one has her period which is good or two may have not got everything out which could hurt her.  If not everything came out then it could cause a serious infection.  Doesnt hurt to know the truth.|`|U0RKvsdsaa	Yes, it's most likely that her body is retaining some pregnancy hormones indicating a positive pregnancy test. Typically RU-486 is 95-97% effective so her chances are slim that she's still carrying. Bleeding and cramping (in the vaginal/stomach area) usually occurs anywhere from 9 to 16 days after taking the pill. But, I'm a little concerned because her doctor was supposed to let her know how to deal with the pain that was inevitably to come with this option of abortion. If you guys are really that concerned though, take her to a hospital or a clinic that is equipped to check her out. You should have her take a pregnancy test sometime next week and one week after that just to be sure. <br>  <br>  Oh, and expect a lot of judgmental pro-lifers to write ignorant crap in response to this as well. Don't get upset - just ignore them and look for someone who actually knows what they're talking about.|`|ybpJUWRnaa	My wife had a miscarriage once and though she passed tissue, still had some left in her body that the doctor had to remove. Your friend should definitely go see her OBGYN to check because this can cause scar tissue build up and complictae pregnancy in the future when she is actually ready for a child. <br>  <br>  As to the pregnancy test, it could be that she took it too soon after the induced miscarriage, but still the best advice is go see the doctor for a thorough exam.|`|AA10372597	I don't juge you or your friend's sister nobody can say what they would do in a situation like this so don't let anyone make you upset or mad just know that they are not you and can't say anything about you or your friends's sister because they don't know you all  and if they say anything just tell them 2 kiss off

You should REALLY ask your doctor.  If you really ARE getting different readings from different fingers and you just test on the finger with the lower reading aren't you really just cheating yourself?  Ask your doctor!!!|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	In Australia and the UK, you measure BG's in mmol rather than mg/dL, and I believe the healthy range is between 4.0 - 7.0.  Gestational might well be lower.  <br>  <br>  Your readings should not vary much among your fingers.  But it's normal to vary a few points even if you test just a few seconds apart.  If your numbers are that erratic, try washing your hands first.  Not just using a sanitizer, actually wash and dry them.  Many people find they get more accurate readings that way.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of insulin!

Uncontrolled diabetes results in miscarriage, damage to the fetus or mother, and birth defects.|`|AA12344593	Blood sugar for the most part is rapidly changing all the time. You can take a reading from one finger and then a minute later, take it from the same finger and get a slightly different reading. I have always used my pinky for the most part. I don't know why; I guess out of convenience and it seems to be less sensitive than the others. I'm not sure what Australia uses to monitor blood sugar but yes anything lower than 80 in the US is considered low. On wikipedia, there's an article on how to convert glucose units. You would take an American reading and divide it by 18 in order to get the system you use which I guess is probably metric. Or multiply yours by 18 to get an American reading. So a reading of 74 here would be about 4.1 by what you go by. My guess is that your range is somewhere between 4.5 and 6.5 to feel okay. I'm sorry that you are experience gestational diabetes as pregnancy must be hard as it is. Good luck and stay healthy!|`|pRF5LLloaa	There is a difference between the SIDES of the finger and the PADS of the fingers, but not a serious difference between fingers.  There IS a difference between, say, your finger tips and your forearm.  Some meters will account for this, most older meters do not.<br>  <br>  ALSO, you are instructed to NEVER use the first drop of blood from you finger.  Always squeeze one drop, wipe it off, then use the SECOND drop.  The first drop, being "closer" to the surface, has most of the  sugar used up.  The SECOND drop, being from the vein, had a more accurate reading.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, there is also a normal, expected difference of about 20 points between each individul test strip!  That is, if you were to take a reading, of say 95 with one test strip, then immediately do another second reading, using blood from the same wound, on a second test strip, the second reading might be anywhere between 75 and 115.<br>  <br>  There is also a significant difference between different meters.  For example,  The doctor's meter will read different from your meter, again even if the blood is taken from the same wound within seconds.<br>  <br>  The point is, Finger Stick Readings are know to have built-in inaccuracies, BUT ANY ONE METER IS ACCURATE FOR ANY ONE PERSON, over the long haul.<br>  <br>  So always use the SAME meter to take tests, and don't let anyone else use your meter to take their tests.<br>  <br>  As well, you should NEVER consider the exact single reading, but only a series of readings, like an average.  Most meters now-a-days also produce 7-, 14- and 30-day averages.<br>  <br>  BTW:  All numbers above are U.S reading. Europen Readings correspond roughly:<br>  72 US = 5 European<br>  90 US = 5 European<br>  108 US = 6 European<br>  126 US = 7 European|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Well, the system does not matter, you have the same blood in all 10 fingers, unless that is different in Australia also.<br>  <br>  I am diabetic and have been for several years.

Rz63LwAqaa	Isso é só o que sei sobre essa doen?a:<br>  A miastenia grave é doen?a da jun??o neuromuscular com sintomas de fraqueza e fatigabilidade fácil da musculatura ocular isolada ou associada com outros músculos de forma generalizada. Piora com esfor?o, melhora com repouso e drogas anticolinesterásicas1-12. Apresenta-se sob as formas congênita familial ou esporádica, neonatal e congênita e auto-imune adquirida. <br>  Já a Tiróide é uma das mais importantes glandulas do corpo humano, a tiróide tem um papel muito importante na secre??o de horm?nios. Seu tamanho (cerca de 13 gramas) é desproporcional à relevancia que possui para o organismo. A tiróide executa as tarefas de supervisionar, estimular e induzir todos os órg?os e fun??es do corpo humano em uma determinada seqüência. Essa glandula endócrina responde pela produ??o de horm?nios, como a triiodotironina ou T3 e tiroxina ou T4. Os altos e baixos desse horm?nios causam as duas principais doen?as da tireóide, hipotiroidismo e hipertiroidismo. é causada pela deficiência de iodo no organismo. As mais freqüentes doen?as da Tiróide s?o: Nódulos Tiroidianos, Tiroidite Cr?nica,  Hipotiroidismo, Hipertiroidismo, Cancer de Tiróide, Hipotiroidismo Congênito, Tiróide de Gesta??o.|`|GDUdGD4Daa	Inicio dos sintomas é a fadigabilidade e  fraqueza dos músculos mais delgados e delicados, como os músculos extraoculares, p. ex. o músculo elevador as pálpebras gerando o fechamento da fenda palpebral (olhar de 'farol baixo' na pessoa por n?o conseguir abrir bem os olhos).

Quanto à miastenia grave,  é uma doen?a auto-imune caracterizada pelo aparecimento de episódios de debilidade muscular como consequência de um funcionamento anormal da jun??o neuromuscular.<br>  Na miastenia grave, o sistema imune produz anticorpos que atacam os receptores situados no lado do músculo da jun??o neuromuscular. Os receptores que manifestam uma disfun??o s?o os que recebem o sinal nervoso por ac??o da acetilcolina, uma substancia química que transmite os impulsos nervosos ao longo da jun??o neuromuscular (um neurotransmissor).<br>  Desconhece-se o episódio desencadeante que leva o organismo à produ??o de anticorpos para atacar os receptores da sua própria acetilcolina, mas a predisposi??o genética desempenha um papel essencial nesta anomalia imunitária. Dado que os anticorpos circulam pelo sangue, as m?es com miastenia podem passá-los ao feto através da placenta. Esta transferência de anticorpos produz a miastenia neonatal, que se caracteriza pelo aparecimento de debilidade muscular no bebé, a qual desaparece ao fim de alguns dias ou semanas posteriores ao nascimento. <br>  Espero ter ajudado.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Minha prima nasceu com esta doen?a e portanto controla,,,ela sofre mais do que o irm?o que tem vida normal...eu sei que eles eram muito magros pele e osso ..e parece que ataca os musculos que nao se desenvolvem...tem problema de tireoide ela toma remédio e ele nunca tomou nada.

7lM0F8v1aa	the best way to assess which will work best for you is to go to an esthetician or a dermatologist.  It really depends on your pore size and the size of the molecules in a specific cleanser.  If the molecules in a cleanser are too large for your pores, it will cause pimples not matter what.  it might work temporarily but eventually the pimples will return.  the pricier brands tend to have smaller molecular structure.  if you have time, steam.  it will open your pores a little and make it less likely for them to be clogged.  just follow up with a cool towel or splash your face will cold water.  i've tried all of the name brands but when i went to get a facial the esthetician recommended a drugstore brand that worked wonders.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	topical clindamycin works great for me
rpf1xrfzaa	First, your goal weight should be set by you and what you feel good with. If your doctor says 20 lbs, then that's probably a weight that will keep you relatively healthy, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't lose a little more if you want to. Set your own goals. The idea is to be healthy, not a number on a scale.<br>  <br>  It is usually a little easier to lose weight when you're younger because your metabolism is a lot faster. It slows down as you get older, which means that it's a lot easier to put on weight and not be able to take it off. Skin elasticity gets weaker with age too, so you would be more likely to have loose skin if you lost weight later on, but I don't think you'll have too much to worry about at your current weight. <br>  <br>  As for how many meals per day, most people will tell you that 5-6 small meals is a little better because it keeps your metabolism going, and it also keeps you mentally satisfied. People like the feeling of eating throughout the day, so sticking to 3 larger meals is difficult, but not necessarily unhealthy. You should try eating both ways and see which ones gives you results.<br>  <br>  With proper diet and exercise, you can lose about 1-2 lbs. per week and keep it off. So, in 5 weeks, you would see a weight loss of 5-10 lbs. At this rate, it would take you at least 25 weeks (6 months).|`|XbiMFT07aa	i believe that the reason people say its easier to lose weight when you're young is because you are still growing and maybe you're not necessarily losing weight, you are simply growing and your weight is balancing.  But once you reach a certain point you stop growing and of course you have to work a lil harder to lose weight.  People say your metabolism slows down when you get older which also plays a huge role.|`|M7vFPsbVaa	Yeah its way easier to lose weight as a kid. I'm almost 15 and i lost 30 pounds when i joined the wrestling team at my high school this year(190 to 160). Your skin will snap back into place too.Its true that if you eat 5(not 6) meals a day, its easier because your calorie intake is more spaced out and makes them easier to burn. Losing the weight is all about caloric intake day to day. If you take in less calories than you use, then you will lose weight. But don't just not eat, you will feel like crap. Trust me i know from expierance(cutting weight for wrestling). Its very unhealthy. If you do follow a healthy diet for 5 weeks, you could lose anywhere from15-25 pounds(it depends on your body). It would take probably three months to lose it.<br>  <br>  I would say 30-40 pounds would be a good weight to lose.<br>  <br>  Yeah i don't know dress sizes though thats the only one i can't answer.|`|phFaBWdHaa	Yes, when Ur young.

jrvwyoN6aa	its possisble that you may get migraine or cluster headaches.  I have migraines myself...  here are some of the symptoms:  one sided pain, throbbing pain, nausea, vomiting, sentitivity to lights, sensitivity to sound...   Your best bet would be to go see your doctor.  I dont think it would be from the ponytail, but it may have aggrivated a condition that you may not have realized you had.<br>  Try to stay away from ibuprofen ... take tylenol instead.  You could get "rebound" headaches with ibuprofen... it may help initially-- but comes right back after the meds wear off.  This happens with most anti-inflammatories.   Migraines are also common in women who are getting ready to get their periods due to the hormonal changes...<br>  Take care!!!|`|VK9AFGnXaa	Many women get headaches very close to the time they start their period....this could be the cause.  <br>  <br>  There is also something called tension headaches.  You can get these due to stress.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are drinking plenty of liquids - especially water.  That keeps you from getting dehydrated which can cause headaches as well.|`|PWfkl3sCaa	If you made the ponytail too tight, your headaches could definitely be from that.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, one of the symptoms of migraines is pain in one side of your head.  It might be wise to talk to your doctor about this possibility.<br>  <br>  I've found Excedrin Migrane works really well.  Also putting an ice bag on your head works wonders.|`|oHaSf55Raa	Drink water. Lots of it. You might just be dehydrated-.<br>  Keep taking the Ibubrofen...just make sure you're not overdosing. Read the label.<br>  If it gets really bad, or stays for a few days, I'd go to the clinic just to get checked out.|`|epG0mlmHaa	If the ponytail was too tight it could give you a headache, but not a big, long lasting one.

Hang in there.|`|6oszhLMqaa	sleep more if u got work take some leave and walk or talk to friend or go and see a docter went u sleep pls sleep straight thanks|`|8A4srHDOaa	Yes its from ponytail. I think you tie your hair after taking a bath... its b'coz your scalp is not totally dry yet...this brings you headache.<br>  <br>  I suggest you dry first your hair thoroughly by using hair blower or just electric fan steady in front of your hair while combing. Also, when climate is hot, our scalp got wet because of our perspiration that's why we have headaches.<br>  <br>  If you still have headaches. Have a medical checkup.. it might be because of an eye problem.   <br>  Also, maybe you are constipated and stressed. Add banana to your diet...it might help. A friend of mine emailed me this: <br>  Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and glucose combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost of energy.<br>   <br>  Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's leading athletes.<br>   <br>  But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit.<br>   <br>  It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.<br>   <br>  Depression: According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.<br>   <br>  PMS: Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.<br>   <br>  Anemia: High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.<br>   <br>  Blood Pressure: This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. So much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.<br>   <br>  Brain Power: 200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.<br>   <br>  Constipation: High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.<br>   <br>  Hangovers: One of the quickest<br>  ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.<br>   <br>  Heartburn: Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.<br>   <br>  Morning Sickness: Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.<br>   <br>  Mosquito bites: Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.<br>   <br>  Nerves: Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.<br>   <br>  Overweight and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and crisps. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.<br>  Ulcers: The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.<br>   <br>  Temperature control: Many other cultures see bananas as a "cooling" fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of expectant mothers. In Thailand , for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature.<br>   <br>  Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Bananas can help SAD sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.<br>   <br>  Smoking & Tobacco Use: Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassiu! m and ma gnesium found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.<br>   <br>  Stress: Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack.<br>   <br>  Strokes: According to research in "The New England Journal of Medicine, 'eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!<br>   <br>  Warts: Those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart, with the yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape!<br>   <br>  So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals. It is also rich in potassium and is one of the best value foods around So maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so that we say, "A banana a day keeps the doctor away!"|`|PeyJ1NiNaa	I get terrible head aches from tyin mt hair up and wearin jewllery, try havin a hot shower runnin the water on ur shoulderss drink lots of water, if they dont go away in a few days go to ur doc my boyf had to do this got a brain scan turned out everything was ok but best to be sure!!

Keep in mind that thiscan be a chemical imbalance in the brain, treatable with medication and therapy There is some good advice out there about how diet and exercise can help, this happens to many people this time of year with the shorter days and lack of sunlight..

If you drink 8 glasses of water every day but you eat unhealthy, it will not make too much of a difference.

The benefits to this are endless. Your skin will clear, it will flush out toxins and make your blood less dense, so that it can move through you quickly, which may increase your metabolism a little bit.<br>  Drinking water also gives you lots of energy, studies have proven, and I can speak for this, that a few glasses of in the morning will wake you up and keep you energized longer then a cup of coffee.<br>  Also, something like 80% of what we perceive as hunger is actually thirst.

wLzsKHNWaa	I don't know how to answer this because I don't know if your teeth are compacted or if you don't have the room since I haven't seen your mouth! hah<br>  <br>  But on a more serious note, I am 20 and I have had mine growing in for the past 2 years or so. My top ones came in fine with no problems. My bottom ones have been poking out for maybe a year. I was told that they are not compacted and that I have room for them. However, this past week they started KILLING ME, like a splitting head ache, ear ache, jaw ache, everything. Basically like a tooth ache on steroids. Apparently if there isn't much room, they hurt really bad when they come in! I would say get them taken out now before you have to deal with this pain! I go through like 12 ibuprofen a day and I am still in pain. I am going in tomorrow to get mine out!<br>  <br>  Also, if the top ones come in a long time before the bottom ones, you'll end up needing to get them pulled because they will keep dropping lower. My dad had to get his top ones out at 35, he got the bottoms out when he was younger. <br>  <br>  Ask for a copy of your x-rays next time you go to the dentist.

Good to see a Behavourial Therapist or a Phycologist for help, they have systems to help peole associate with this problems.|`|IDvhlHs7aa	I don't beleive theres an ADHD for adults,|`|W5RSx8Fraa	Yes, it definitely can! My husband has ADHD. As he got older he learned different coping mechanisms and ways to go about getting around his ADHD, but he still has ADHD and still needs medication during full time study. <br>  <br>  Many of the symptoms he has are just like childhood ADHD symptoms, but because he has learned how to deal with them both in work and school it's not as obvious. He tells me that it still bothers him when he needs to study, but in the classroom or at work he's just learned how to act, but prefers the meds when what's going on matters like in university.|`|mwTYjzQoaa	eh?|`|w4A7Rct6aa	I was 26 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. For me, it mostly manifested in poor conscious focus (I couldn't watch a movie without doing at least one more thing at the same time), unwanted hyperfocus (couldn't tear myself away from certain things, even if I wanted to), poor stress management (too many things, and I just crawled back into my shell and nothing got done) as well as poor planning skills (had a very hard time grasping the whole picture and planning accordingly). Speaking with my parents after the diagnosis, we realized that some of the signs had already been there from when I was young: poor motor skills, trouble focusing on school work, constantly switching hobbies, deep and narrow interestes that lasted only short whiles, and so on.<br>  <br>  Finally, I got an appointment with a psychatrist who put me on Concerta, which is similar to Ritalin, and it changed my life. I still notice the effects of ADHD, but to a lot lesser extent and in some cases I can even use them to my advantage. Hyperfocus comes in handy when something really has to get done.|`|ejC5wVG2aa	Yes, it does. The symptoms depend on the type you have. Often people with inattentive type aren't diagnosed until adulthood because they don't stick out as much as the hyperactive type. The symptoms also may not matter much to you until you get into a situation where they do, like college or a job.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to jerks who spew their mindless opinions about it either.|`|d011d0cbd6d702eda9db0089617adc01aa	It continues on until you stop being babied and get the swift kick in the rear that you need.

It's okay to get high but be smart about it.|`|eyQBvbzraa	why do you want to know? for starters,hydroxyzine is not used to treat anxiety.the fact that you spelled it right means you probably have someones prescriptions.grow up and stop copping out trying to get high.it will ruin your life whether you believe it or not|`|yxl6GHbRaa	U can't Be serious!!!!

I was just prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety today. It is also an antihistamine however. It has two uses. They gave it to me to hold me over until I see a doctor about my depression. They can definitely get you high and this guy would know this if he researched what he claimed to know so much about even on google (commonly xanax and valium is abused from which you obtain the same effects only more substantial). He is right however about the fact that abusing drugs can ruin your life. Don't just take random medications to try to get high from them. It is really dangerous, especially if you don't have a prescription and you don't know for sure what the meds really are.|`|lKE7GiHraa	Take a few, its fun!

Isso porque durante o sexo anal, ocorrem pequenas fissuras no reto que se tornam porta aberta ao organismo para qualquer tipo de bactéria, vírus ou fungo dos quais o homem possa ser portador. Se há ejacula??o o perigo aumenta, pois o reto se torna depositário do esperma que pode conter tudo isso. Além das fissuras, há o fato do intestino ser o principal órg?o de absor??o. Mesmo n?o havendo as fissuras, tudo será absorvido pelo intestino. Por isso, a ordem é: sexo anal sem camisinha, nem pensar. Boa sorte.

NRP4ZrjRaa	Em primeiro lugar, beba muita água, no mínimo 1 litro por cada 25kg de seu corpo, ou seja, se vc pesa 74kg, beba no mínimo 3 litros de água por dia, pois a falta de água, fará com que seu corpo "economize" este líquido precioso e escasso, o que acarretará em reten??o de líquidos no seu corpo, e a reten??o é a grande responsável pela aparência de incha?o.<br>  <br>  Segundo ponto,se você deseja perder peso, procure fazer exercícios de muscula??o sim, pois eles s?o ótimos para queima de calorias, desde que sejam feitos da forma adequada, ou seja, pouco peso, e repeti??es rápidas e com intervalo curto estre uma série e outra.<br>   - Quando praticamos muscula??o, estimulamos o principal tecido responsável pela queima calórica, que é exatamente o tecido muscular. Mesmo após vc terminar seus exercícios, seu corpo estará queimando gordura (veja bem, n?o é apenas calorias, e sim gordura).<br>  <br>  Ponto 3, evite comer, ou ingerir bebidas que contenham a?ucares (glucose, glicose) ou qualquer bebida que possua corantes. Pois seu corpo estará, como eu disse, queimando gordura, por pelo menos 1 hora após o fim dos exercícios, e caso você ingira qualquer tipo de substancia, que n?o seja água, seu corpo transferirá a energia que está ajudando a queimar gordura, para que seja feita a digest?o do que está sendo consumido.<br>  <br>  Ponto 4, procure alimentar o seu corpo de 3 em 3 horas, isso n?o quer dizer que você deva se empanturrar de comidas calóricas, gordurosas, ou do?uram, opte por sucos, iogurtes, frutas, cereais, queijos brancos, etc.<br>   - Quando você se alimenta em curtos espa?os de tempo, você passa a informa??o de saciedade ao seu cérebro, o que fará com que seu corpo n?o reserve gordura (que é grande fonte de energia).<br>  <br>  Ponto 5, PENSE SEMPRE EM REEDUCA??O ALIMENTAR, E READEQUA??O DE ROTINA, E NUNCA EM DIETAS MILAGROSAS, E SACRIFíCIOS FíSICOS.<br>  <br>  Boa sorte!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Correr na esteira.|`|da2dd9b69305543c7d33ce981a149758aa	vc ta fazendo tudo isso mesmo???<br>  <br>  naum ta tendo resultado ?<br>  <br>  ent?o vc deve estar fazendo algum coisa errada . <br>  <br>  vc tem em m?o um excelnte serie de exercicos pra emagrecer , muita pessoas queria ter condi??es e tempo pra fazer isso tudo que vc faz .<br>  <br>  me manda um e-mail , posso te passar umas dicas bastante interressantes que possa te ajudar .<br>  <br>  <br>  backupadilha@gmail.com<br>  <br>  isso se vc tiver interesse né<br>  <br>  abra?o|`|GxeGQnqyaa	Coma bastante proteina,e albumina,pq o excesso desse nutriente é um queimador natural de gordura!!Tb ingira Lcarnitina ou C.L.A!!|`|Uw2eJM2Vaa	é MAIS do que suficiente, você é que está com muita pressa de perder peso.

N?o vejo a necessidade de se fazer abdominas todos os dias, s?o musculos como os outros e também precisam de descanso, alterne dia sim, dia n?o.<br>      Você pratica muitos exercícios, tem uma vida muito ativa, n?o pode ingerir t?o poucas calorias/dia (como ja disse antes)., seu corpo pode estar tendo que tirar de onde n?o deveria por isso a dificuldade em perder peso. E por ultimo, n?o fique presa à balan?a, o peso as vezes n?o reflete a realidade, exemplo: um cara muito forte (tipo fisiculturista) pode ter 1,80 de altura e pesar 90 kilos, e n?o nescessariamente estará gordo e sim com massa muscular avantajada, pois musculo pesa mais que gordura, acompanhe tambem seu desenvolvimento no espelho! espero ter ajudado!|`|h3qKACAPaa	Trabalho na área de Nutri??o ha alguns anos!

Existe um exame que detecta o grau da doen?a. Geralmente ataca pessoas de idade e logo após a menopausa. A identifica??o se dá pela quebra, fácil, de ossos. às vezes um simples abra?o pode quebrar costelas. O exame é: densitometria óssea. é indolor e rápido demais. Ah! pode atacar crian?as e jovens.

A  psoriase é uma doen?a de fácil diagnostico e que tem vários tipos de medicamentos e na sua maioria com efeitos colaterais importantes. O problema maior para um psoriatico é trabalhar o seu emocional e tentar levar uma vida mais tranqüila deixando de lado muitos problemas que só vem a piorar o quadro clínico,ok?

Dr. Alessandro Loiola<br>  <a href="http://www.dralessandroloiola.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dralessandroloiola.blogspot.c...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A Psoríase, uma doen?a cr?nica da pele, afeta cerca de 0,5% a 3% da popula??o mundial, sem diferen?a entre homens e mulheres. Cerca de 40% das pessoas afetadas desenvolve a doen?a antes dos 20 anos de idade, e apenas 10% desenvolvem psoríase antes dos 10 anos de idade.<br>  <br>  A Psoríase se caracteriza por uma altera??o no processo de matura??o das células da camada mais superficial da pele, a epiderme. Durante um ciclo normal, os queratinócitos levam cerca de um mês para maturar e chegar à epiderme. Na psoríase, a prolifera??o dos queratinócitos ocorre de modo muito rápido e estas células se acumulam na superfície da pele, formando placas avermelhadas ou arroxeadas, com sensa??o de coceira ou queima??o nas regi?es afetadas.<br>  <br>  <br>  O QUE CAUSA A PSORíASE?<br>  <br>  A causa exata da psoríase continua sendo um mistério. De um modo geral, os pesquisadores acreditam que a psoríase esteja relacionada a altera??es no sistema de defesa. Também é possível que existam fatores genéticos (35% das pessoas com psoríase possuem um ou mais familiares afetados pela doen?a) e ambientais (p.ex.: frio, estresse, e uso de medicamentos como captopril, progesterona, lítio, indometacina, etc)<br>   <br>  <br>  A PSORíASE é UM PROBLEMA GRAVE?<br>  <br>  A psoríase n?o possui cura: a maioria das pessoas apresenta crises recorrentes da doen?a. Apesar das complica??es graves serem raras, a psoríase pode causar uma série de complica??es menores.<br>  <br>  A psoríase pode causar deficiência de folato, uma vitamina do complexo B importante para o funcionamento do sistema nervoso.<br>  <br>  Quando as placas s?o visíveis, a Psoríase pode resultam e depress?o e isolamento social. Em cerca de 75% das pessoas, a psoríase resulta em diminui??o da autoconfian?a.<br>  <br>  Mesmo nas suas formas mais leves, a psoríase pode causar sensa??o de queima??o, coceira ou fisgadas na pele, comprometendo a qualidade de vida da pessoa afetada.<br>  <br>  Finalmente, o próprio tratamento da psoríase pode resultar em sensa??es desconfortáveis e altera??es em outros órg?os.<br>  <br>  <br>  COMO é FEITO O DIAGNóSTICO?<br>  <br>  O médico irá examinar as les?es na pele e, dependendo da suspeita, poderá pedir um exame de material colhido das les?es.<br>  <br>  Exames de sangue e radiografias podem ser solicitados se houver necessidade de excluir doen?as com manifesta??es semelhantes (p.ex.: dermatite seborreica, rea??es alérgicas, infec??es por fungos, etc).<br>  <br>  <br>  A PSORíASE POSSUI TRATAMENTO?<br>  <br>  As principais medidas para tratamento da psoríase incluem:<br>  <br>  o Medicamentos tópicos (p.ex.: lo??es, cremes ou xampus a base de corticosteróides, análogos da vitamina D3, retinóides tópicos ou fluorouracil). <br>  <br>  o Fototerapia (p.ex.: terapia com raios ultravioleta tipo B).<br>  <br>  o Terapia sistêmica (uso de drogas que afetam o corpo como um todo e n?o apenas a pele, como metotrexate, retinóides, ciclosporina, hidroxiuréia, sulfassalazina e tioguanina).<br>  <br>  o Exposi??o ao sol: a exposi??o regular à luz do sol é útil para estimular a regress?o das les?es nas pessoas com psoríase leve a moderada.<br>  <br>  o Apoio emocional: uma vez que as crises podem estar relacionadas a episódios agudos de estresse e ansiedade, técnicas de relaxamento podem ser úteis. <br>  <br>  <br>  Na maioria das pessoas, a psoríase comum desaparece espontaneamente, sem necessidade de qualquer tratamento e sem deixar cicatrizes. Entretanto, recorrências s?o comuns. Em 1/3 dos casos, a psoríase é severa e requer o uso intensivo de medicamentos pelo resto da vida.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Dr. Alessandro Loiola é médico, escritor e palestrante.

AA11902675	It sounds like you are going to have a busy summer!<br>  <br>  Now, if you are really 5’8” and only 130lbs., then you certainly do NOT need to lose any weight!!!<br>  With that said, I completely understand that being told that isn’t automatically going to make you content with your body, but maybe rather than focusing on your weight, you could find a couple of other solutions to make you feel more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Finding the right swim suit could be a big help!  I’m not sure what you would consider your “problem” area, so I found a couple good sites with suggestions for flattering suits for different body types. <br>  Off hand, I’m thinking you probably want a one piece if you are going to be swimming a bunch.  If you are uncomfortable with your hips, thighs, or rear end, you could always get a suit that has short bottoms, or pair your suit with a cute swim skirt!<br>  <br>  My other suggestion to you would be to work on toning rather than weight loss.  Building some muscle could help to define your body and not only make you stronger and more fit, but more confident about your body.<br>  If you go this route, do keep in mind that you might notice a bit of an increase at the scales.  This isn’t cause for panic though!  Muscle weighs more than fat, that’s all.  In fact while the scales may go up, your actual measurements will likely go down.<br>  <br>  I hope some of this helps, and that you are able to relax and enjoy your summer!!!|`|LTajzAjqaa	I know a girl who is my friend that is 5ft and she weighs 130 pounds...

O que é bom para mim poder ser terrível para vc...e n?o pense que a médica vai acertar de primeira. Pode ser que vc precise trocar depois de usar uns meses e n?o se adaptar com ele.<br>  Como cada organismo reage de uma maneira diferente, ent?o vc pode ter rea??es diferentes das que eu tenho. <br>  Por isso mesmo, fa?a um bem enorme a sua saúde. Vá em uma ginecologista e pe?a a ela um anti. Ela, apenas ela, vai saber lhe recomendar o certo.<br>  <br>  E n?o, n?o existe nenhum anti que emagre?a querida. Se existisse, a mulherada usava apenas este.....|`|kRuWbEOFaa	O que seu ginecologista receitar|`|0uNGb4ypaa	A escolha do anticoncepcional ainda gera incerteza em muitas mulheres. Qual o melhor método? Algumas dúvidas foram esclarecidas pelo médico ginecologista e chefe do Departamento de Tocoginecologia da Faculdade de Medicina de Jundiaí (FMJ), Rogério Bonassi Machado, em entrevista ao Jornal de Jundiaí Regional.<br>  Jornal de Jundiaí - Qual o perigo de as mulheres e meninas se auto medicarem? <br>  Rogério Machado - Os anticoncepcionais hormonais, sejam por via oral ou n?o, variam bastante quanto à dose e tipo de horm?nios. Cada mulher tem uma rea??o diferente no organismo. A automedica??o pode causar dores de cabe?a, enj?os, dor nas mamas e incha?o. Mulheres com mais de 35 anos que fumam, precisam de acompanhamento médico, pois o uso do contraceptivo está associado ao aumento no risco de infarto e de derrame cerebral. Um estudo norte americano associou a obesidade ao maior risco de falha durante o uso de pílulas, 70% maior em mulheres com peso acima de 74,8 quilos.<br>  JJ - Como saber qual o melhor anticoncepcional? <br>  Machado - O ginecologista recomenda o melhor método baseado em uma série de parametros. é importante se observar os fatores de riscos clínicos, como a hipertens?o arterial, o diabetes, o tabagismo, a obesidade. Nestes casos, o método deve ser de baixas doses de horm?nios.<br>  JJ - Com tantos métodos contraceptivos, ainda tem meninas que engravidam sem querer. O que os pais devem fazer? <br>  Machado - A gravidez na adolescência é um assunto que envolve condi??es ambientais, familiares e socioecon?micas. O que poderia reduzir esses índices é a educa??o, que come?a em casa, pelo convívio e abertura com os pais para tratar de assuntos de sexualidade, além da escola e dos meios de comunica??o. Num país com contrastes sociais, isso é problemático, mas o poder público facilita o atendimento médico e disponibiliza métodos contraceptivos nas unidades de saúde.<br>  JJ - O que é a pílula do dia seguinte?<br>  Machado - A pílula do dia seguinte, ou de emergência, baseia-se em alta dose hormonal num único dia, logo após a rela??o sexual desprotegida, por falha do preservativos, ou em casos de estupro. Usada com freqüência, sua eficácia pode ser comprometida.<br>  JJ - Uma mulher que toma anticoncepcional por muito tempo tem dificuldade em engravidar?<br>  Machado - Com as pílulas de baixa dose, o retorno à fertilidade é rápido, em média após 3 a 5 meses. O mesmo ocorre com os adesivos contraceptivos, implantes, anel vaginal, injetável mensal e DIUs. O método que tem maior tempo de retorno à fertilidade é o injetável trimestral, em média de 9 a 12 meses. <br>  JJ -Existe o melhor método contraceptivo? <br>  Machado - N?o, o que existe é o melhor método anticoncepcional para cada mulher, ou seja, o mais adequado para as condi??es individuais de cada uma. Assim se consegue maior sucesso, seguran?a e aderência aos diversos métodos disponíveis.<br>  <br>  Ab?s DCPNeto|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	N?o..pq é hormonio e geralmente ele faz engordar, mas nao pra todo mundo.

Porém, uso camisinhas há mais de 10 anos e só rompeu uma.

If water doesnt appeal to you try putting crystal light packets in your water then gradually decrease that to flavored water like Fruit20  Eat small meals instead of big ones.  Write every single thing you eat and the calories and record them.  Add them up and make mental notes on what you should do better  the next day(dont get angry with yourself on what you did or didnt do that day, tomarrow is a new day.  Have faith in yourself!!!  Lots of raw veggies!!  Lean meats like fish and chicken.  Eat  more protein and fiber.  Set baby goals first (5 pounds by this time)  Weigh yourself once a week to note your progress.  Do simple things like parking your car at the back of the parking lot, clean house, or just take a nice brisk walk listening to your favorite tunes.  All movement adds up to calories burned.  Above all please dont do fad diets they work for some yes.  But they arent diets you should be on for a long time.  Everyone should diet in terms that everyone should do all they can to help their body became healthier.  I hate the way the word diet is used to be a quick way to lose weight, instead of a healthy life change.  Let the rest of your body finally have say in what it wants/needs instead of your mind and taste buds.

The kidney and liver are the 2 more significant ones.<br>  <br>  :D hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <and do vote me for best answer! :D>|`|f7de5918183c9539e2c2d9c8cb090974aa	Well mostly good rest is important to give your muscles a break and a chance to repair. Each time you work out you are slightly breaking down your muscles and enlarging them. You need rest to let them get used to that. Eventually they go back to their normal size in preparation for the next strain on that muscle...

jpry4bEmaa	Eat salad for lunch and dinner every day..add seafood for meat like shrimp or imitation crab... but give your self a big healthy breakfast without bacon or sausage. Do about 50 crunches in the morning and drink plenty of water I have been doing this for 2 years now I am 28 and weigh 115lbs 5ft 6in...you will see a difference in two weeks I promise. Just don't binge when you get hungry...eat regular but healthy when it's time for a real meal...avoid fat and sugar at every cost...kick soda to the curb|`|ab6c493f91ee96628f1337c9e7d2bfcdaa	just eat a lot of fruit|`|5356026da17dd7fd9ec0858d2e03b877aa	do atkins. It's scientifically proven to be the best way to lose weight. No bread, pasta, rice, cereal, or anything with flour or corn in it. No more than 25 grams of carbs per day. When you get hungry at night, fill up on meat (turkey, ham, chicken) and water as fast as possible. Don't give your stomach any room for sugary or carb filled snacks.<br>  The cravings for carbs will go away in 2 weeks.|`|AA10091485	alright haha i know how you feel.<br>  im 132 pounds, but im 5"10 and only 17<br>  so a little difference, but i understand where you're coming from, and its really good and amazing that u want to lose the weight in a healthy way!! good for you.<br>  okay here we go:<br>  when im feeling a little bloated or am trying to lose a few pounds for a beach day or party, this is some of the stuff i do:<br>  1 egg and about 6 almonds in the morning<br>  (almonds have the HealTHy kind of oil, that your body likes, and eggs whites only have about 36 calories each! I use to eat bannas everyday, but i found out that a regular size one is about 100 calories!! ahh :0)<br>  <br>  Stay away from all fast food AND esp. starbucks, a tall (small) frappachino has more than 500 calories, which is like twice what u should be taking in for breakfast.<br>  <br>  Instead of having 3 big meals a day, have about 5, but make them all smaller. Always eat something right when u wake up, because it will start your matabolism for the day :]<br>  <br>  excersice a lot! Running, althought it may not always be the most fun thing to do, burns the most. about 800 in an hour. For more fun, walk around the mall for a few hours that will burn a few too (buy a few things and get a few shopping bags... then you'll be walking with weights!! haha + bonus shopping). <br>  <br>  Its very best to eat AFTER you exercise.... it speeds up your matabolism. Don't eat too much though... Also: something to keep in mind: Vegies and fruits are good for you, but fruits, although claimed very good for u, must be eaten in moderation... Fruit has sugar, natural sugar yes... but sugar all the same. After i exercise i have a club of mixed fruit... my body can use the natural sugars better then, than an hour later. <br>  <br>  Don't eat any food after about 6:30, that way you will still have a fairly good matabolism rating before u go to sleep. <br>  Instead of dessert, though tempting... go for the frozen yogurt.. and if u can't resist, gelato has about half the calories that regular ice-cream does.<br>  Fish with out much seasoning has barley anyyy calories, so eat up! Eating a bit of fiber is good for you and it will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  <br>  remember, everything is good in moderation, don't overdue broccoli just because its good for you :]<br>  <33 <br>  good luck loveyy|`|YT0cFKiZaa	drink green tea.<br>  it helps your metabolism be quicker|`|f9O1q6gxaa	First off, how old are you? I'm guessing pretty young. If you can take off the weight by dieting alone, go for it. Whatever makes you happy. Your body needs exercise, though. For the time being, you might think you look fine with dieting alone, but a lazy lifestyle will eventually catch up with you. When they say, " Use it or lose it," they ainy' lying. Try to find something you enjoy doing. Dont all chicks have little dogs that they dress up in pink sweaters? If you do, take it for a walk. You might get more exercise than you think you do. Here's an idea! - move your mailbox 7 miles down the road and walk to check your mail every day!|`|dAQJbRtsaa	well you should def. try to exercise! Like some kind of cardio...like running, dancing, or even just walking. <br>  But if you want to just cut back on your eating...<br>  try not to eat a lot of sugar or carbs.<br>  Go for lean meats, veggies, fruit, and A LOT OF WATER!! <br>  but try to stay active so your healthy! <br>  ...hope this helps! : )

It might not be a bad idea to check with your doctor before staring any diet. There is a simple yet effective diet that you can obtain call the Sacred heart diet. It is used in cardiac patients presurgically and not only drops the weight but also flushes your body of uneeded fat and maitains a good LDL,HDL and triglycerides. It is a simple diet including lots of fruits and veggies and little excersise. You will lose 5-10 pounds a week on this diet so it is only intended for a jump start diet. I did very well on it and actually lost 28 pounds and feel great. So check it out on line just do a search for the sacred heart diet. Thanks and I hope it helps......|`|OTgRGXpDaa	go to the south beach diet website...it really worked for me! Lost 12 pounds in the first 2 weeks without starving or working out a lot.|`|dIgRln0Daa	The key to lose weight and keep it is to detoxify your body first. When you have too much toxins, you can not go to your body to get the energy, and all your energy only came from the food you eat. That is why you exercise and feel hungry all the time and can not lose weight. There are many things you can do to help lose weight, like eat every three hours, (Is not what you eat, is how you eat. You can eat almost anything, but avoid big meal), drink green tea, exercises 30 minutes daily. And most importantly go get massages for several months.

I think it depends on your body composition, but I had to lose about 12 pounds to drop a size. However, my mom only has to lose around 8 lbs to drop a size. So it might depend on how you are built. I won't say it's impossible for you to do, but it might be close.

I recommend you make a nice dinner with a candle lit room and then after wards get into something sexy and try to turn him on by four play or things like that.

I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as all joint surgery is not covered by insurance in USA or by NHS in the UK. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world.

As I understand it, Fitness for Life is supposed to help students become more aware of and improve their physical fitness, nutrition, overall health status.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if, by itself, Fitness for Life will help you to lose weight. Losing weight requires commitment; it includes not just getting regular exercise, but also eating healthier and learning how to control your portions sizes. <br>  <br>  Some of the changes you could be making in your diet now are to include several servings of fat-free milk, and at least five servings of fruit and/or vegetables every day. They will help you to feel full and provide you with the essential vitamins and minerals you need at little calorie expense. <br>  <br>  Also, try going out for a half-hour walk three times a week or more. As you get used to the exercise, increase your sessions to forty, fifty, or sixty minutes. Then, if you want, you might think about joining an organized sport. It will get you out of the house more often and you'll have plenty of chances to make some new friends.|`|8XIc6TU4aa	ummm....<br>  wtf is 17 stones??

I have had both the LEEP (what you are mentioning) and a cone biopsy. They did both of these to figure out what stage of dysplasia I have. On a scale of 1-10 (1 being nothing and 10 being full blown cancer) I am a 3. Chances are at this point they have seen abnormal cells via your pap smear and want to go in to take a better look.  I'm assuming you have had a Biopsy...  Make sure you ASK her where you stand. I developed these cells within a years time. I go them because I have HPV. Although my GYNO could have cut them all out as they are a small area in my cervix, instead I am going back in 6 months to have them re-assesed as the Human body is a wonderful thing and will most likely defeat the abnormal cells on their own. <br>  <br>  You will be okay. I promise! The LEEP procedure feels like a sharp pinch, VERY quick though. You may have a few cramps after you have it done.  But you will be fine! It is good that you are having this. Basically they are cutting it all out. Good Luck, be strong. :) xo

To lose weight the first step is to detoxify your body first (green tea detoxify body). Too much toxins, make it very difficult to go to body to burn away fat; and all your energy only came from the food you eat. That is why people exercise and feel hungry all the time and can not lose weight. There are some other things you can do to help, like eat every three hours, so you would not feel hungry and eat too much each time. Is not what you eat, it is how you eat and how much you eat. You can eat almost anything, but avoid big meal, (big meal bring blood sugar up and left over energy become fat), drink green tea, exercises 30 minutes daily. And most importantly massage your self around legs, arms, and torso to detoxify your body and to improve circulation. After you free of body toxins, whatever you do to lose weight will work.|`|kngs8YyGaa	diet anything doesn't help you lose weight. fake sugars like aspartame, sucralose, etc. cause an appetite increase over time by changing the way your "fullness receptors" in your body interpret how much you've eaten. the result-- you end up consuming more calories than if you'd just had the regular soda. false sugars are also known carcinogens (cancer-causing). I read an article the other day that said "diet" drinks and sugars like what are found in your diet green tea may actually contain calories. Let me explain. This is a new scientific study that hasn't been thoroughly researched yet, so don't hold me to it. :) however the article said that the way calories in food are measured are by what is absorbed/used by the body in a certain period of time, say 1-3 hours. the article suggests that your body may be unable to process the fake sugars and therefore holds onto them for many hours or days at a time before absorbing them, delaying the calories from hitting your body for awhile. who knows if this is true or not, but to be safe i'd probably stick with plain green tea with a little honey or real sugar or just straight-- it does have a lot of health benefits after all and the real stuff can bring your metabolism up about 5% or so if you drink a few cups
8WuGnXe7aa	You need to get a blood panel run by your doctor. There could be a number of reasons for this, the most likely explanations being a vitamin deficency, Iron defiecency or Anemia. <br>  It can be a neurological symptom, but as you've had CAT scan that was negative, it's unlikely that it's a neurological complication. Another possible explanation could be your hormone levels. Abnormal hormone levels could also cause a symptom such as dizziness and/or light headedness.<br>  Other possible diagnoses include Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), Postural Hypotension (low blood pressure) (though you would probably also feel faint with these conditons) and  Vertigo (not fear of heights! It's an inner ear problem),Hypothroidism (underactivity of the thyroid gland) to name just a few.<br>    More serious conditions such as Automatic Neuropathy, Addisons Disease, etc, are very rare and would most likey present with further symptoms, so I highly doubt you have anyting to worry about there. Ask your doctor to run some bloodwork and he might also want to do a urine analysis to check for sugar in the urine.<br>   If you are very concerned, consider seeing a specialist, but the most likely outcome will be something simple so don't worry yourself sweetheart. <br>    Take care. =)|`|AA11700922	is it hot there cuz that happens to me and i get dizzy all the time or it could be youve been on the computer for to long take a break from the computer and when you sleep make sure its very dark and cool in youre room

My mom was on that stuff for years and she didn't have a problem with swelling.  Also, you've been on it for awhile and it probably wouldn't just start up all of a sudden.  <br>  <br>  It could be the chocolate.  Chocolate is a diuretic and it can make you retain water.  Also, salt intake is a frequent cause.  Occasionally anit-inflammatory meds and calcium antagonists can cause swelling.  <br>  <br>  Make sure to elevate your feet as much as you can and avoid standing for long periods of time.  Also, see your doctor.  It could be caused by some serious diseases (like thyroid problems, heart failure and kidney disease) or just because you're getting older and you're less active.

Segundo entender que  com todos esses elementos juntos você intoxica seus sistemas corporais, daí se instalam as mais diversas doen?as, daí você se entope de remédios para remediar os efeitos de outros remédios e isso vira um círculo vicioso. Terceiro ingerir diariamente um produto fitoterápico chamado Bálsamo da Amaz?nia-BioVida e substituir o seu jantar por um envelope diário de Shake up, que fornecerá ao seu organismo todas as vitaminas e sais minerais necessários diariamente. Aliado a isso você pode fazer uma caminhada de trinta minutos , três vezes por semana. Você vai emagrecer sem o efeito sanfona e sem se preocupar com sobras de pele.

AA1iVPuUaa	Isotretinoína é uma substancia medicamentosa, utilizada no tratamento do acne ou da rosácea.<br>  <br>  Derivada da vitamina A, a isotretinoína é uma substancia que age nas glandulas sebáceas, reduzindo seu tamanho e consequentemente a secre??o de sebo, e altera permanentemente a sua composi??o. Age ainda evitando a obstru??o da abertura do folículo piloso e reduz a inflama??o.<br>  <br>   <br>  Estrutura molecularUsualmente, percebe-se melhora da acne desde o início do tratamento com a isotretinoína, mas é possível ocorrer uma piora entre a segunda e a sexta semana. Depois, ocorre a evolu??o gradativa para o desaparecimento das les?es.<br>  <br>  Os efeitos colaterais variam de pessoa para pessoa e devem ser controlados por médico. O mais grave é a teratogenia, gera??o de defeitos permanentes no feto. Por isso, o uso de isotretinoína é proibido em gestantes e é imprescindível que as mulheres realizem teste de gravidez antes de iniciar o tratamento. As mulheres que têm vida sexual ativa devem usar dois métodos anticoncepcionais concomitantes durante o tratamento e por pelo menos dois meses após o final do tratamento.<br>  <br>  No Brasil o Idec constatou que a negligência por parte do governo, dos médicos e dos fabricantes com a prescri??o da isotretinoína pode causar defeitos congénitos t?o graves quanto os causados pela Talidomida nos anos 50. Esse estudo foi feito com 61,2% dos dermatologistas registrados no Conselho Regional de Medicina do Distrito Federal.<br>  <br>  Em gestantes, a droga causa, além de inflama??es de pele em vários graus, morte do feto ou malforma??es graves como hidrocefalia e microftalmia, em alguns casos associadas com defeitos nos vasos sanguíneos.<br>  <br>  Em n?o-gestantes, os outros possíveis efeitos colaterais s?o reversíveis e desaparecem após o término do tratamento:<br>  <br>  ressecamento labial (ocorre em 100% dos casos); <br>  ressecamento das mucosas bucal, nasal, genital e ocular; <br>  queda e ressecamento de cabelo; <br>  sangramento nasal (devido ao ressecamento da mucosa); <br>  ressecamento intenso da pele; <br>  dores musculares e nas articula??es; <br>  dor de cabe?a; <br>  aumento do colesterol e triglicerídeos; <br>  altera??es das enzimas hepáticas. <br>  <br>  Cuidados<br>  A pele fica mais sensível ao sol, devendo ser protegida com o uso de filtros solares. <br>  Combata o ressecamento das mucosas com cremes umectantes nos lábios, soro fisiológico no nariz, lubrificante ocular nos olhos e lubrificante próprio para mucosa genital feminina. <br>  Usuários de lentes de contato podem necessitar de lubrificantes oculares com maior frequência. <br>  N?o tome antibióticos do tipo tetraciclina ou seus derivados, devido à possibilidade de surgirem efeitos colaterais resultantes da intera??o entre os medicamentos. <br>  Tome o medicamento durante ou após as refei??es. <br>  Deve-se evitar a ingest?o de bebidas alcoólicas durante o tratamento <br>  No caso de mulheres é extremamente importante que n?o fiquem grávidas durante o período de tratamento, tal gravidez será de alto risco e de grande perigo para o bebê. <br>  O tratamento da acne com a isotretinoína é, em geral, seguro, desde que seja adequadamente acompanhado pelo médico. Seus efeitos colaterais s?o bem conhecidos e podem ser controlados através de exames periódicos, que devem ser solicitados pelo dermatologista responsável pelo tratamento e de acordo com a evolu??o do paciente.<br>  <br>  Pode ser encontrado na forma de gel ou de cápsulas.<br>  <br>  Nomes Comerciais<br>  Roacutan (Laboratórios Roche) <br>  Lurantal <br>  Isotretinoína (medicamento genérico) <br>  Isotrex <br>  Cecnoin <br>  Isoface <br>  <br>  IMPORTANTE: CONSULTE UM DERMATOLOGISTA|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	eu só conhe?o omprimidos...seca a pele e eu penso que melhora tudo inclusive os cravos, mas por ser um produto muito forte se vc n?o tiver problemas de acne , melhor limpar a pele e usar produtos tópicos.

As três principais causas de conjuntivite s?o:<br>  <br>         1. Contamina??o do olho com bactérias ou vírus. Eles podem ser transmitidos pelas m?os (principalmente), por toalhas, cosméticos (particularmente maquiagem para os olhos) ou uso prolongado de lentes de contato. Os dois tipos de infec??o s?o contagiosos.<br>         2. Irritantes s?o outra causa de conjuntivite. Os causadores podem ser a polui??o do ar, fuma?a (cigarro), sab?o, sabonetes, sprays, maquiagens, cloro, produtos de limpeza, etc.<br>         3. Alguns indivíduos apresentam conjuntivite alérgica (sazonal), devido a alergia à pólens. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      Quais s?o os sintomas?<br>  <br>      Varias combina??es dos seguintes sintomas podem estar presentes: coceira, olhos vermelhos, fotofobia (sensibilidade à luz), incha?o das pálpebras e secre??o nos olhos. A secre??o pode ser desde aquosa até purulenta, dependendo da causa da conjuntivite.<br>  <br>  <br>      Dura??o<br>  <br>      Na maioria dos casos dura de poucos dias a duas semanas. Conjuntivite alérgica dura enquanto o alérgeno estiver presente.<br>  <br>  <br>      Tratamento<br>  <br>      O tratamento varía dependendo da causa. Medica??es (pomadas ou colírios) podem ser recomendadas para acabar com a infec??o, aliviar os sintomas da alergia e/ou diminuir o desconforto.<br>  <br>      Cuidados:<br>  <br>          * Lave suas m?os com frequência.<br>          * N?o coloque as m?os nos olhos para evitar a recontamina??o.<br>          * Evite co?ar os olhos para diminuir a irrita??o da área.<br>          * Lave as m?os antes e depois do uso de colírios ou pomadas.<br>          * Ao usar, n?o encoste o frasco do colírios ou da pomada no olho.<br>          * Evite a exposi??o à agentes irritantes (fuma?a) e/ou alégenos (pólen) que podem causar a conjuntivite.<br>          * N?o use lentes de contato enquanto estiver com conjuntivite.<br>          * N?o use lentes de contato se estiver usando colírios ou pomadas. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      Pode-se prevenir as conjuntivites?<br>  <br>      é difícil prevenir-se das conjuntivites, mas algumas medidas podem diminuir o risco de você adquirir uma conjuntivite, que s?o:<br>  <br>          * N?o use maquiagem de outras pessoas (e nem empreste as suas).<br>          * Evite compartilhar toalhas de rosto.<br>          * Lave as m?os com frequência e n?o coloque-as nos olhos.<br>          * Use óculos de mergulho para nadar, ou óculos de prote??o se você trabalha com produtos químicos<br>          * N?o use medicamentos (pomadas, colírios) sem prescri??o (ou que foram indicados para outra pessoa).<br>          * Evite nadar em piscinas sem cloro ou em lagos. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      ATEN??O:<br>  <br>      Se ocorrer algunm destes problemas, contate seu médico:<br>  <br>          * Altera??es visuais.<br>          * Dor ocular intensa.<br>          * Dor ao movimentar os olhos.<br>          * Febre.<br>          * N?o melhora com a medica??o.<br>          * Secre??o continua após o término da medica??o.<br>          * Aumento da sensibilidade à a luz.|`|76c940cfbf91ce8fd42176faa1ceeb14aa	consulte um dermatologista..<br>  tenho uma tia q tb é assim ela lava o rosto pela manh? e passa uma pomadinha nos olhos..<br>  fica o dia inteiro limpinhooo...<br>  fa?a isso ele saberá a pomada certa para vc!<br>  boa sorte!|`|wxnnthDCaa	Cara no meu ponto de vista vc deve ter algum problema na sua vista ja procurou um oculista tenho certeza que vc vai reslver isso se consultando. <br>  <br>  acho que deve ser por falta de óculos. <br>  minha irm? era assim e ela resolveu com óculos. certo?<br>  boa sorte.

Os casos de aneurisma de aorta s?o graves e de dificil tratamento.<br>  Poder ter ocorrido uma coarta??o da crosta da aorta, o que também impede o sangue de entrar nas artérias do bra?o.<br>  Sobre doen?as isquêmicas, como o infarto agudo do miocárdio, o adormecimento do bra?o n?o é relatado (pelo menos n?o que eu saiba e/ou tenha lido), o que mais se observa é uma dor, em queima??o e/ou aperto, que irradia-se do peito para o bra?o e/ou costas e mandíbula.<br>  <br>  Outra patologia que pode estar levando a esta adormecimento do bra?o, fora as causas cardio-vasculares, pode ser decorrente de uma compress?o nervosa, na altura da coluna cervical, de onde emerge o plexo braquial (conjunto de nervos que v?o inervar os músculos do bra?o). Com o compress?o destes nervos, sintomas como adormecimento e "enformigamento" podem ocorrer. Os populares "picos de papaguaio" ou hérnias de disco podem causar sintomas assim, quando ocorrem na altura da coluna cervical (pesco?o). <br>  <br>  Enfim, é necessária uma consulta médica detalhada, com história clínica e exame físico para poder definir concretamente qual a causa do adormecimento. Caso seja necessário, exames de imagem (Raio - X, tomografica computadorizada, etc.) podem ser solicitados, mas diante de uma suspeita clínica, e n?o para "achar" o diagnóstico.

6Qvk21ncaa	First off, most nurses should have been trained to assess the wound first prior to removing the sutures, and then to start removing every other suture.  That way, dehiscence will be kept to a minimum if it does occur.  If the wound does open, they should reassess the wound for signs of infection, contact the physician to see what the physician would like to do.  If the wound is not deep, and appears to be free of infection, they may want to apply steri-strips and cover with a dressing.  If there is some depth to the wound, it may need to be packed, most likely with a moist to dry dressing.  The physician may or may not request that antibiotic cream be placed on the wound.  Either way, the nurse needs to document the status of the wound, report to the physician and recheck frequently for signs and symptoms of infection and wound closure.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	call the doc and go from there.......unfortunately (at times) its all up to the doc

Teoricamente todos os medicamentos desta classe s?o capazes de induzir alucina??es em doses tóxicas. Porém, existe o risco de les?es muito graves no organismo e até a morte.<br>  Geralmente s?o medicamentos vendidos com receita controlada, justamente para evitar o abuso.<br>  Alguns outros medicamentos (principalmente antinflamatórios) podem causar este tipo de efeito em dose tóxica, mas os efeitos sobre o corpo s?o devastadores, alguns igualam-se ao LSD.<br>  Pense que um simples xarope pode provocar um efeito assustador quando mal utilizado.<br>  A farmácia é uma loja de remédios. Se a venda e livre e você tem dinheiro, você compra.

Aquilo fui tudo para mim: posso ir ao cinema sozinhooo! :-)<br>  <br>  Se você n?o está gostando do jeito que você é atualmente ou da sua rela??o com o resto do mundo, o único conselho que posso te dar é fazer psicoterapia (análise).

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	Marijuana has been used to treat a large number of medical issues. It relieves nausea in chemotherapy patients, it reduces intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients, it stimulates appetite in AIDS patients and others, it is a non-narcotic, non-addictive pain reliever for those suffering chronic pain from injury. Recently it has been found to suppress certain tumors. It may be of use in Alzheimer's disease since a study in rats showed it to stimulate the growth of brain cells that are destroyed by the disease. Sadly, most of the potential research into the benefits of this plant is suppressed by its legal status.

Be sure to keep it clean,  and cool if possible.  If it looks like its getting infected, see a doctor.|`|0OX9gAApaa	Ok, is it discolored at all?  Is it blistered?  How long ago did this happen?  Is there any pus coming out from the nailbed?  It may be infected if this was awhile ago and you left it untreated.  First, with a burn, I would clean it off with peroxide.  But, if it looks infected, you will have to get an antibiotic from the doctor.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	play soccer........well if you burnt it w/the pancake then its gonna hurt for a while, burns do that....try keeping it covered w/a bandaid|`|hH9krZkCaa	run under some cool water then compress if you think that the pain is severe. sorry compress with icepack if none just rape some ice in a bag and hold on it for 5 to 10 min

As long as you are not experiencing any swelling or pain, you are fine and the bruising should eventually subside, depending on how fast your body heals itself.

I6YPgPNeaa	As for over-the counter medications that can interact with lithium, the most common drug interactions with lithium are the Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents  (NSAIDs)that are often used to treat aches and pains. When combined with lithium, NSAIDs can increase lithium levels in the blood resulting in an increased risk for serious adverse effects like confusion, tremor, slurred speech, and vomiting. Examples of non-prescription NSAIDs include:<br>  <br>      * Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin)<br>      * Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)<br>  <br>  There are also many prescription NSAIDs such as the following:<br>  <br>      * Celecoxib (Celebrex)<br>      * Diclofenac (Voltaren or Cataflam)<br>      * Etodolac (Lodine)<br>      * Indomethacin (Indocin)<br>      * Ketoprofen (Orudis)<br>      * Ketorolac (Toradol)<br>      * Meloxicam (Mobic)<br>      * Nabumetone (Relafen)<br>      * Oxaprozin (Daypro)<br>      * Piroxicam (Feldene)<br>      * Tolmetin (Tolectin)<br>  <br>  In general, it is best to avoid the NSAIDS listed above when taking lithium. Certainly, they should not be used frequently or on a regular basis without permission from your doctor(s).<br>  <br>  If you do need a pain reliever while taking lithium, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin (Bayer, Bufferin, Ecotrin) are safe alternatives. Sulindac (Clinoril), a prescription pain reliever, can also be used as an alternative.|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	there alright but dont do them at the same time. and take them on a full stomach|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	just fine,.....actually when you are having pain or fever you should take tylenol rather than drugs like NSAIDs......like ibuprofen... because of the fact that ibuprofen could result in an increased serum level of lithium and depending on ur dose of lithium, may be a bad thing...........unfortunately psych docs don.t always readily alert their patients of this.....|`|aw9wVEckaa	sry I don't know but the girl above seems to be well versed in it, ask your doctor or do some research for help.|`|d7YZHz5Raa	Wow.

95909e7f492a3016a6aab247d3b20594aa	The effects of mixing various drugs and alcohol are dependent on a number of things like the person's chemical make-up, what drug they are taking and how much they drink. <br>  <br>  Some people will vomit every time they smoke pot and drink alcohol.<br>  <br>  Tylenol is the most popular pain reliever in the U.S. Tens of billions of doses of it and other acetaminophen-based products are consumed each year. For the overwhelming majority of users these medicines work as advertised and are completely safe. However, you do face the slight chance of abrupt death.<br>  <br>  Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure,and kidney damage and kidney failure;; even if we leave alcohol out of the picture. According to one study, it accounts for 20 percent .<br>  <br>  <br>  The real problem with drugs like Tylenol is that the difference between a therapeutic (that is, medically effective) dose and a toxic one is surprisingly small. In adults the maximum safe dosage is four grams (eight 500-milligram tablets) over a 24-hour period. The toxic dose is a mere seven grams taken all at once.<br>  <br>  You can make the margin even thinner by drinking too much and eating too little. I'll spare you the biochemistry, but basically acetaminophen and alcohol in combination overwhelm the liver's ability to remove toxins from your bloodstream. At the same time, starving yourself reduces the liver's output of glutathione, a natural detoxicant produced in response to food.<br>  <br>  The upshot is that heavy drinkers (two or more drinks per day) who don't eat can suffer worse liver damage from Tylenol than people who OD on purpose. The would-be suicides on average took twice as much of the drug as the accidental victims. Yet far more of the latter went into a coma (seven versus three) and died (four versus one). Why? Because most of the accidental victims were alcoholics. Five people--three accidental victims, two attempted suicides--overdosed on less than four grams, the claimed safe dosage for 24 hours.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	taking the tylenol  after a nite of hardcore drinking isn.t a good thing because it can contribute to liver damage.......the ibuprofen is not as bad to take after a nite of heavy drinking.......as long as you aren.t doing it many times a week, on the bottle it usually says not to take it if you drink more than 3 times a week.....it can increase risk of internal bleeding......but if you have no headache/hangover then there is no reason to take it.......
EvlfVKOxaa	I had gagged ears once. NeoSporin is good, use it a lot. It'll keep it from getting infected, I used it and it helps. Just fight through it, try gagging them smaller instead of right to 12s. I went to 00 and back to nothing without much pain. It'll hurt for a few days but it gets better. Keep using antibiotics and it should get better. I also used peroxide (sp?), that made them feel better without the burn of alcohol.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when I went to a new size, one took longer to get in or it was a bit tighter. Before you go up to the next size (if you do) pull on the ear a lot, make sure it heals good before you do it or it'll hurt a lot more. I wouldn't worry. Just keep it clean and you'll do fine! XD<br>  <br>  <br>  I played soccer when I had mine and had to do the same thing. At first, at a smaller size like 12. It is gonna probably hurt to put them back it. I can't remember because it was a while ago I did it but, I think size 10 was the most painful stage, it almost "pops" you ears. I think after 8-6 I could take them out and leave them for several hours and it would be fine to put them back in. So short answer, it will probably hurt a little. The more often you do it the better it'll get.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	the way to soak them w/salt water is to get medicine cups and stick them in there........neosporin is okey for it, but just put it on there if it seems to start getting infected......don.t use rubbing alcohol, too harsh......don.t mess w/them too much, if you do, wash your hands thoroughly beforehand.......|`|2bd9366e1eabce5b4a7fcff530981221aa	Pour salt on it thoroughly.

If the cough supressant you are giving him/her  is formulated WITHOUT alcohol,  just a touch of rum or whiskey...NOT BOURBON!! SINGLE MALT WHISKEY!!!...ought do NO harm. When I was teething, my grandmother used to let me chew on a rag that had been treated with a water / whiskey solution to help dull the pain. Whenever I was sick as a small child, she would give me a dose of whiskey to help me sleep at night. The dose equivelant was roughly half of what you should give if the stuff were cough medicine. Since many pediatric cough medicines are now formulated in day and night  recipies, the rum may be unnecessary, Tiraminic makes a good nightime formula. Otherwise, you can treat the rum as a medicine and dose your toddler of four with up to half a teaspoon. My brother from another mother *as I put it*  has 7 kids, the toddlers from 4 down get Waldryl *walmart version of benadryl* every night to make sure they sleep well when they are ill. The four year olds get one teaspoon, so one quarter to one half a teaspoon (of rum or whiskey) should do just fine. <br>  <br>  unless, of course, your child turns out to be violently allergic to alcohol which you would have discovered by now.|`|RJpekNPfaa	I would NOT mix rum and cough medicine together.<br>  <br>  When I was a child, I would often be given a hot toddy to help me sleep when I had flu.<br>  <br>  Put the juice of one orange, a teaspoon honey and a small nip of brandy into a saucepan and gently warm on the stove. <br>  <br>  Sip the warmed drink.<br>  <br>  Soothes a bad throat / flu and helps you to sleep.<br>  <br>  I was 8 though, not 4.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	i.d give it to him.....kids are annoying and sick kids are intolerable!!!!this is my honest opinion........i don.t have kids and never will..........i don.t believe it is immoral because it will help your kid get the rest that he needs......|`|umzuADEkaa	Heaps of coff medicines already contain alchole.I wouldnt mix the two might have a bad affect on your cutie :)<br>  hope he gets better soon|`|0wUOZwyVaa	YES!!!!!!

9QGlZNXNaa	no.. it will not change the sugar content of the fruits into something else. it's still mostly fructose... some fruits contain glucose (like grapes), but they won't change in the blending process|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	it does not create harmful sugars.......|`|eXX2OwALaa	Simple. natural sugars don't become harmful unless you could chemically process them somehow.  Blending doesn't do that.|`|gKUr1cqSaa	This is a good question.  Since there shouldn't be any chemical process or fermentation taking place, then the sugar (fructose) should remain the same even after the fruit is blended.  <br>  <br>  I guess we could address the concept of harmful sugar.  When people typically think of sugar as harmful, they are usually referring to sugars with a high glycemic index - sugars like Sucrose, dextrose, maltodextrin, corn syrup, etc.  If someone implied that blending fruit raises their glycemic index (making it more harmful... FYI I like sugars.. All of them and believe in moderation they are fine for me.  A diabetic on the other hand may have a different philosophy), they may have been thinking that the fiber in fruit (which helps slow digestion and therefor lowers the glycemic index) was compromised, by the blending process, in a way that would reduce it's efficacy on digestion and absorption of sugars.  This could be likened to a manufacturing process to some degree.  <br>  <br>  I would think if blending the fruit did degrade the natural fibers, the overall net effect would probably be negligible.  So smoothie up!!

Negative symptoms are the absence of something, like not being able to form coherent sentences.<br>  <br>  from wiki:<br>  Positive and negative symptoms<br>  Schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive (or productive) and negative (or deficit) symptoms.[14] Positive symptoms include delusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorder, and are typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Negative symptoms are so-named because they are considered to be the loss or absence of normal traits or abilities, and include features such as flat or blunted affect and emotion, poverty of speech (alogia), anhedonia, and lack of motivation (avolition). Despite the appearance of blunted affect, recent studies indicate that there is often a normal or even heightened level of emotionality in Schizophrenia especially in response to stressful or negative events.[15] A third symptom grouping, the disorganization syndrome, is commonly described, and includes chaotic speech, thought, and behaviour.

Your weight should be no more than 155 if you want to live a healthy life.<br>  <br>  It is good that you are doing exercise, but a well balanced nutritional program is the foundation for building a healthy body with the right balance of electrolytes.<br>  <br>  I have found a family of nutritional products that I know gives me the best chance for longevity and health.

I was one of those who did not believe in them until I tried it. And I tried a few until I found a great one that works (its all natural too! - it's just pills, but you'll detox, lose weight, and fell much, much better). You can go to <br>  <a href="http://www.help-me-diet.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.help-me-diet.us</a> and order you free trial, also you only pay $4.95 shipping and handling. Good luck!|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	murmurs are heard by listening directly to the heart like w/a stethoscope.... sounds more lik palpitations|`|LLwcBJMPaa	A heart murmur is caused by backflow of blood within the heart and can be due to either a patent foramen ovale (typical birth "defect" that most children grow out of), or insufficiency in one or more of the heart valves, meaning that they cannot properly stop the blood from flowing backwards.<br>  <br>  What you describe is not a heart murmur, and should really be checked by a qualified physician.  A good cardiologist should be able to accurately identify what is happening by looking at an EKG of your heart. Particularly if you get an EKG under physical stress (running a treadmill or whatever) since it seems your symptoms are more prevalent then.<br>  <br>  It's likely not a major concern, but it could possibly be, and the only way to be sure would be to get in and have it checked.|`|o3ZhhZpcaa	I'm trying to lose weight too and it's sooo hard. My aunt is using a weight loss product and it's really working for her (100% natural). I'm gonna try it and I recommend you try it too.  It's really a colon cleanse, and it's a healthy way to detox, not like most diet pills.

Ytu9ItaMaa	yes|`|uOxil1jyaa	Yes.  The acupuncture needle entry points are small and do not pose any threat to the integrity of the skin.<br>  <br>  If for any reason you are feeling sleepy or woozy after your treatment, don't take a very hot bath right away.  But usually, you feel very alive and well after a treatment, so this isn't usually a problem.

Ti8O8oH6aa	It is not nessicarily testicular cancer! It could be a cyst which is common. If it is a tumor then it might not even be malignant. It could be totally benign. Benign means you dont have cancer btw. Malignant means you do. Just make an appointment and have it checked out by the doctor. Dont be scared just stay relaxed. Freaking wont help you. Just make sure you let whatever parent is taking you know about it. And tell them in a calm manner or they could freak. I wouldnt worry about it until you find out what it is. Hope everything goes well for you! :)|`|BJo2SB4vaa	go to the doctor|`|4267b03363d41760fddf75decfb09e9baa	well first of all cancer doesn't usually hurt,, but you should go and see a doctor..|`|vQvOGp65aa	if it hurts, it's probably an ingrown hair (a member of the zit family).  have your doc look at it.  you're probably ok.|`|33k609Hcaa	You go to the doctor.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	go to the doctor........its probably a hydrocele or a cyst or even an ingrown hair................
CuaGc6FOaa	in 2 weeks that is alot of weight to lose. I suggest that you dont, because it might retrigger you eating disorder.<br>  <br>  but, regardless i will include a healthy diet plan, but it will be difficult as your metabolism could be quite screwed up and it might take you awhile to get it back to working properly.<br>  <br>  When you are recovering, your body will horde the calories you eat until its adjusted again. During this period of time you might eat uncontrollably or behave weirdly around food too. Because <br>  A. your subconcious knows there is food there and will try to make you eat as much of it as possible, now that you are eating and as hard as you try to refuse sometimes you will overeat.<br>  B. Your underlying instincts will also be turned on for survival mode.<br>  <br>  Losing weight, that is what you're is doing wanting to do would be detrimental and only make it worse.<br>  <br>  But i will give you a healthy eating plan.<br>  Im serious about this, you might want to get rid of any foods, that will cause you to overeat, like chocolate, timtams, cake anything. Replace everything with something healthy instead. The logic is if you want to overeat it will be twice as hard to do so with all the fruit and vegetables around.<br>  <br>  Get rid of any dairy and soy milk.<br>  Dairy is not good for you and if you care about your health, you wouldnt want to eat.<br>  Also get rid of bread.<br>  <br>  Eat Fruit, Veg, meats such as chicken, beef, lamb, salmon and tuna are very good, sushi, miso soup, nuts just nothing unnatural or processed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.notmilk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notmilk.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mbm.net.au/health/guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbm.net.au/health/guide.htm</a>|`|kjpbSlmyaa	The Cambridge Diet is an amazing diet - It is very low calorie but quick, effective, and you get one-on-one support from a Cambridge counsellor in your area. I've lost over 3st in two months. I can honestly say it has changed my life, and along with the counsellor has given me a new healthy outlook on food. The biggest bonus from the diet is that once you have reached your goal, you can go back to your counsellor every two months or so to keep you on track and staying slim for life.|`|Ei0UGkwtaa	when you wake up every morning go running 4 about 30 min. then when you get home drink some water. i used yo weigh 160 know i weigh 130 you should try it.|`|JIGNnm5yaa	Have you considered adopting a Vegan diet - eliminating dairy and meat/fish?  If you swap normal milk for soya milk and avoid eggs and cheese, etc you will lose weight without going hungry.  <br>  With a history of eating disorders I would recommend this as you can eat healthy and regular meals, rather than starving yourself which really isn't a long term solution.<br>  I  think your weight sounds healthy, and you need to be realistic.  You are unlikely to lose nearly a stone in 2 weeks, so don't see your holiday as a target.  Just enjoy the holiday and worry about it when you get home.<br>  Have fun.

It's really helpful to me, because some things are on there that I never would have thought would burn that many calories. Play with it for a little while, it should give you some ideas on different things you can do (I know walking gets boring after a while), and let you know what you're burning while you're walking!

Make sure your diet is full of "full calories" and not "empty" ones.  You want to eat foods that are low in cals so you can eat more and feel fuller longer and therefore cut down on your eating.  I know I didnt fully answer your question (because its pretty hard to say) but I hope I helped.
XbiMFT07aa	1.  Not usually at 14, maybe when you are older and your bones begin to weaken and become brittle.<br>  2. No. If your lips change its a result of you growing. But that of course will cause them to get bigger not smaller.<br>  3. Drink plenty of water.  Cut down your unhealthy eating (like sweets and other unhealthy snacks) Work out more.  Make sure you burn more calories than you take in.  Theres no real way to know how fast you lose weight.  Of course larger people can lose weight faster.<br>  4. Make sure you keep your hair clean and use a good conditioner and cut your dead ends.  Also eat properly, cut out the junk.<br>  5. Well if you have a pimple already then try using toothpaste on them to make them go away faster or you can put a hot towel on them as well.  If you are young you are probably going through puberty so you will get them (pretty much no matter what) but drink plenty of water and just eat healthy.  Keep your face free of oil build up.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	1. at 14. no you cant shrink <br>  <br>  2. Lips wont shrink but when your older i guess your face could get bigger and stretch and make your lips look smaller<br>  <br>  3. work out at lest 1 hr a day, eat 3 times a day. No snacks. No Bread, NO Cokes, No Sugar. No Salt. Nothing fried.<br>  Lots of Meat (grilled or baked) and Fruits and Veges. drink at lest 8 cups of water a day<br>  <br>  4. Hair and Finger nails grow from the food you eat de composing inside you. want longer hair ? eat a lot of food<br>  <br>  5. Wash your face in Really hot water. then scrub your face with a rag with Soap on it really hard. and then wash your face again in Hot water<br>  Repeat 1 or 2 times every day|`|lWEiOxCZaa	1. Yes as people get older (80's and up) they lose some height due to bone loss (osteoporosis)<br>  2. Yes, lips do tend to shrink because we lose or gain weight. Sometimes collagen.<br>  3. Drink lots of water, no sugar, no breads/starches and take vitamins.<br>  4. Stop towel drying hair as it breaks when you do this, also use professional shampoo, take biotin for healthier hair.<br>  5. Keep face clean and oil free/witch hazel or alcohol/peroxide.|`|jPWgSRjfaa	Well I am not sure about your shrinking questions.  I can help with some others.  Losing weigh fast isn't very healthy you should lose it at about 3 pounds every 2 weeks. The first week or two you will lose more than that though.  To grow hair faster make sure you keep you ends trimmed nicely.  Just take care of it.  Pimples are difficult but I suggest washing your face about twice a day and sitting in the sun a few times to dry them out. Not long enough to get sunburn but just for a little while. Hope some of this will help you.|`|E64vWYlBaa	1. yes when they get old their backbone bends and that makes them shrink<br>  2. no<br>  3. excercise about 1.5 hrs a day and eat whole grain cereal with skim milk and berries 4 breakfast, whole grain turkey sancwich for lunch, orange and ten almonds for snack, and grilled salmon and brown rice for dinner. bake instead of frying. eat slower.<br>  4. get it trimmed <br>  5. wash your face twice a day and don't touch it a lot. eat lots of brazil nuts, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, fruits, and veggies which make your face have a healthy glow. cut down on sodium and sugar which cause acne flare ups|`|lugPKzniaa	3)Lose weight:<br>  top eating after a certain time, say 7 or 8, unless you are active from then. also, stop eating junk food, substitute it by fruits instead. and be active, even walking an hour a day =) trust me, i've done it that simply and im happy yay haha.<br>  4) also, hair doesnt really grow faster. it grows the same i heard...<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  (3)EDIT:<br>  oh yeah. eat many small snacks per day (you dont want to starve yourself!), and a BIG breakfast! if you dont eat breakfast, you'll gain weight and get headaches. also, i dont know if you heard of this, but take a food and rub it against a piece of paper (carrot, butter, etc). if it turns clear, dont eat it.<br>  <br>  5) you can remove blackheads by pouring boiling water into a large bowl, place a towel over your head so the steam wont go away, and just sit like that for at least 10 - 20 minutes. I personally cant really do that it hurts a bit haha. also, dont pick at pimples! you might spread infection and cause more! if you do, rub rubbing alcohol on it to dry it.<br>  Also, your hair and hands have natural oils, so if you come in contact with your face, they may cause pimples. if you have bangs, clip them to the side sometimes or off your face (:<br>  <br>  good luck !
XbiMFT07aa	Usually when you lose weight it comes off on various spots on your body so its hard to pin point weight loss like that.  Try lifting weights that works your back.  Like maybe try lifting them and pushing your shoulder blades together.  Any kind of weight lifting that works your back.

XbiMFT07aa	Eat less and work out more.|`|h9F0oe8zaa	The point is not to eat less. The point is to make your body think that theres always food. There are signals in the body that makes us store what ever we eat if we starve ourselves.<br>  So eat every 3 hours ... and limit fats of course and carbs. But you need to have some fats and carbs to make it a healthy diet .. if not the body will naturally store any fat or carb you eat thinking they are not available.<br>  <br>  Squeeze a fresh lemon in the morning and put it into a warm glass of water (pre heated, don't heat with the lemon) and drink. Have your breakfast 30min to an hour after that.<br>  Eat every 3 hours<br>  Eat between 300 - 400 calories not more. If you eat more than 500-600 calories you will start to store the extra calories (this depends on your height and weight of course)<br>  Keep a journal of the food u eat (I use sparkpeople.com online food journal. u can keep track of what u eat and what u eat more and deficient of so that u can control)<br>  Exercise 3-4 times a week<br>  Eat more fruits and vegetables<br>  Eat more in the morning and lesser as the day goes by<br>  Have your last meal by 7.30pm<br>  If you get hungry after that eat an apple or something with fewer calories<br>  Exercise 30 minutes after eating and eat a meal 2 hours within exercising<br>  Get 7-8 hours of sleep<br>  less stress helps to lose weight too .... meditation helps<br>  <br>  I weigh 130 pounds and an 5'4 tall so to lose weight I maintain a calorie requirement of 1200 - 1500 calories a day. I usually like to eat somewhere in the middle. if you are taller than me the requirement might change. But maintaining a diet around 1500 calories is not bad.|`|833d70a4ed040e4f805c878125daa019aa	What do you consider "eating healthy"?  How frequently do you work out?  What level of intensity are your workouts?  Many people (myself included) tend to underestimate the amount of calories we consume and overestimate how often and how hard we work out.  To get an accurate analysis it often helps to keep a food diary.  Try keeping one for at least a week.  It may also help to keep a fitness log as well.  Do a google search for free sites that calculate the amount of calories in foods and calculate the number of calories burned during various workout activities.  Calorie Count on about.com is a good place to start.    <br>  <br>  Even if you're eating only healthy foods, you may still have difficulty losing weight if you don't exercise portion control.  It's not just about what you eat.  It's about how much you eat as well.  Eating less doesn't necessarily mean you'll lose weight either.   It could actually slow down your metabolism. If you continue to have problems losing weight, maybe you should seek the advice of a nutritionist or dietician.|`|uQO3gtyPaa	i struggled to lose weight for a long time until i found a program that motivated me and got me to stick to the program that i chose. the program helped me to go above and beyond what i was already doing to lose weight before the program i always started and that would get discouraged but this program has alot of support with it. i was so happy about it that i elaborated about it in a blog. my blog is <a href="http://www.dietfitness1.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietfitness1.blogspot.com/</a> check it out i think the info can only help|`|Zow9M4jSaa	Elle is right, eat less and work out more! keep track of calories burned and calories eaten. make sure u burn  more than u take in ..................by a minimal deficit of 200 calories per day and u will loose weight. also, switch up your work outs a little.....tricking the body is key. another trick is to wear ankle or wrist weights during your work outs, this fools the body into thinking u weigh more than you do....thus, burning more calories. a heavier body burns more calories during the same work out as a lighter body. what type of work outs are you doing?.....make sure you do cardio....very important!<br>  cheers,<br>  m|`|17471738df9f7c7e3ff7efabd8099f6baa	You need to up your exercise intensity or change your exercise all together.

XbiMFT07aa	It depends.  There is a certain amount of calories our bodies burn on its own without working out (and its different for everyone).  As long as you stay under that you will lose weight but if you work out then you can allow yourself to eat more.<br>  <br>  Use the site below to help you determine how many calories you need to maintain your current wieght.  Then you will just need to stay under that number in order to lose weight.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Never go under 1000|`|NAJDIRo2aa	It's never healthy to go below 900 calories. That's generally how much your body needs to maintain basic functions. If you go any under that, your body will slow down your metabolism to deal with the loss of energy intake. It's better to maintain a daily calorie intake of about 1400-1600 if you're trying to lose weight. A trick that helps is eating several small meals throughout the day to keep your metabolism burning all day. <br>  <br>  From my own experience, drinking a lot of water during a meal keeps me from overeating.  Water intake also keeps your body from bloating after salty meals.|`|OwgU3VVdaa	I think around 800 cals is probobly the absolute least. You'll lose weight super fast.<br>  <br>  also yes.

Write a paper that describes how you achieved your goals.  Search ebay for similar items to find out how to price yours.<br>  <br>  And, look up e-books on the Web and you'll probably find sites that will give you direction on how to create one and market it.<br>  <br>  BTW, it's exercise -- not cize.  Good luck and congrats on your success!|`|XbiMFT07aa	I think you should set up a website where you advertise free weight loss tips.  When people give you their email address then you will infact send them a few (maybe 10 or so) tips that will help them lose weight.  But make sure that it does not fully give away your full diet and exercise program.  Then in that same email you can give them a chance to get your full program by paying a fee (whatever your fee is).  Make sure to include before and after pictures.  Then when people opted to buy your program you can sell it as an eBook, that way you can email it in an attachment and save money on printing and shipping.  <br>  <br>  First though I would suggest you get a test group made up of people of all ages and sizes to try your program to make sure it works for other people and not just you.

JIkZuKX4aa	Cantaloupe isn't different from one to the next. The compounds that make it up are the same. However, based on the environment the cantaloupe grew in and how you feel and the environment your eating in, you can experience different tastes. Maybe more sugar exists in one to the next because of how it was formed, which means it would have more carbs. However, the difference you experience in taste isn't that many more carps. Maybe one or two max. The idea works for all fruits.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|XbiMFT07aa	No - Well just because something is sweet or not sweet to you doesn't mean that it will taste the same to someone else.  This has to do with your tastebuds.  So just because something taste sweeter doesn't mean it has more cals.  Maybe the fruit is not ripened yet or not as ripe as the other fruit you had. Either way it contains the same amount of calories.|`|G6CiZQ7kaa	No. Taste has no realivence with calories, well far as fruit goes.  A avacadoe has more calories (lol atleast I think thats a fruit cannot remember) has more calories and isn't very sweet compared to a strawberry, even if they are the same serving size.|`|9cboqdGUaa	No.<br>  But the more colorful of a fruit (on the inside) means more sugar.|`|smR7u6H8aa	no that does not mean that it is more calories it means that is more ripe so you had a more ripe peice of fruit or less ripe lol|`|omWyuZxsaa	No, but they taste delicious so eat fruit it's good for you!|`|swpFNEcZaa	no|`|6eDn9SPpaa	No, it doesn't. The fruit maybe hasn't ripened totally yet but it still has the same amount of natural sugar.|`|D0PKGY8Saa	no...whered u here such a idea geeze and if im wrong where dd i heear such a idea of saying no geeze...
XbiMFT07aa	well are you a big person (over weight)?  its possibly to lose quickly if you are large.  if not then perhaps you were not certain of how much you weighed before you left (unless you weighed the morning of the day you left).  Did you use the same scale wearing the same thing and having the scale in the same spot?  All these play a part.  Perhaps you did lose some weight but 15 in a week sounds a bit much.  You should be able to tell in your clothes.  They would be falling off of you.|`|BRT2teSqaa	It's impossible to lose 15 pounds by just doing that. Although great exercise, that would cause a 4-5 pound weight loss at the MOST.  Maybe your scale is broken.  If not, sudden weight loss like that often signals illness, so make an appointment with your doctor.|`|KzUtjTxaaa	Most likely you didnt drink enough water.|`|MZ6D2zY3aa	ohwow.

HK30PzNraa	I quit smoking around two years ago and went through about the same thing as you are describing.The best thing you can do is take care of yourself,drink lots of water-it helps cleanse your body,rest when you can,and exercise.I started walking for 35 minutes a day.It was nice to do that and not be out of breath.The symptoms will go away,but it will take time-after all you smoked for 9 years!Congratulations on quitting-GOD-bless|`|hmsMpECkaa	Quitting anything that your body has become used to will cause problems and smoking is one thing that will cause many things.  Start taking magnesium to relax the muscles and do not take naps.  For 9 years your body has been accustomed to a dose of nicotine and whatever other poison is in cigarettes.  It will take almost half that long for your body to get it out of your system if you do nothing else other than quit.  However, drink plenty of water and do some nutritional things top help you.  And thank you for being one more person who has taken that filthy drug off the street.|`|q9BItD25aa	Good for you....and you will make it!  Your going thru  withdrawal        .........don't give up now.<br>  Everyone on line will be rooting for you...if you need encouragement we will all be here.|`|TLG09zKzaa	you are going through withdrawal. this usually last about two weeks but I guess it varies from person to person.

Kudos to you for standing and fighting the nasty habit!|`|oP5GUtD0aa	i hear you gain a lot of weight!|`|7025a6c6a18e110fc5a6cbaa84055a0baa	Nope,not me.|`|pLRhaOrzaa	It's definitely withdrawl.  My mom just quit smoking and had to use a patch because her withdrawl was so bad.  I'm really proud of you though!!  My dad died because of smoking two years ago when I was a freshman in college - lung cancer is an absolutely cruel way to die.  <br>  If you're having a lot of trouble, the doctor can prescribe you a nicotine receptor inhibitor.<br>  Good luck!!|`|A4yU7apkaa	i know a person who use to smoke and they didnt get sick|`|AA11245006	its the withdrawals. <br>  <br>  stick with it - you'll make it thru it. and you'll feel better soon. Plus you'll live longer.<br>  <br>  Congrats on Taking the First step to a longer life.
f3deDdDWaa	using milk or any other type of food product,creams,lotions,or oils can actually trap heat beneath the skin, making the burn worse and can also put you at risk for infection.<br>  <br>  aloe vera gel (can be cooled in the fridge to help soothe burning) is the best thing for a sunburn.<br>  <br>  there is no cure and usually takes about 3-4 days for a mild sunburn to start healing.<br>  <br>  if you have blisters, do not attempt to pop them, unless they are still intact after 3-4 days<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s- as a side note, i currently have a sunburn, all over my back, and i would suggest you use this brand:<br>  <br>  Solarcaine cool aloe<br>  <br>  <br>  it will restore moisture to the skin, it also has lidocaine|`|fprhm68taa	Tomatoes are suppose to help.|`|A4yU7apkaa	try milk i saw it in a show and it probably really works|`|OdmXO48laa	um.. no product is not gonna help u ... buy some aloe vera to put on it!|`|ngJSgQBHaa	Of course aloe. Make sure it has lidocaine. Keep skin moist 2 prevent peeling. Tea bags in bath tub! Tea has tannic acid-helps heal burns. U can take benadryl orally 2 get rid of redness.  Drink lots of H2O & plenty of rest. U will b suprised by the tea! Donot use oil base lotion!!!  They will keep the heat in making burn worse. Lotion must be water base!  Ibuprofen is an antinflammatory agent. It will decrease swelling,redness and pain. 2400mg/day max|`|c82UmLDkaa	aloe vera gel should soothe it for a while, i would just put it on the burnt areas and rub it in good. then let it sink in for a while before you lay down or put a shirt on.|`|QwgxqaAOaa	If you don't want to go out and buy something, grab some lotion you have laying around the house.. stick it in the freezer until it's cold, and then apply as needed.. it feels great on a sunburn!|`|MSgZw0AKaa	No........ ppl i think might not have the info ur looking for,dude<br>  So maybe buy the lotion put it in the frige it is like jello it is cold and feels good bye,the 8 yr old|`|ULI9BZPIaa	The best thing you will EVER feel in your life is a nice rub down with lotion that is kept in the fridge.  If is Aloe Gel, it works WONDERS!|`|AA11245006	Cold washcloth. keep your skin moisturized. constantly hydrate it. i dunno. LOL|`|7025a6c6a18e110fc5a6cbaa84055a0baa	Baby cream! works for me every time|`|iYDID6QRaa	Any thing with aloe usually will help. A product called Noxzema really works well for me. It takes the heat out of the burn and relieves for a little bit.
DpLsRUzwaa	It's fine.  I'm a dry man myself, but one piece of advice about lotion that comes to mind is to avoid kinds with too much fragrance in it.  Sometimes that can cause irritation to sensitive areas.|`|2abe831c6001afd4cbe8beb06e7e6a90aa	Only if you are drinking it also.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it, but try lube. It works better.|`|KmlYhqKyaa	No, your penis is external.  It means don't drink it.  So masturbate with it all you want.<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|5debee918420491ae93ce443dfcac6d1aa	nope. i use it sometimes|`|WxEDotuWaa	As long as it doesn't get in your urethra (pee hole) then you're good.|`|U9VuWoZ1aa	Try olive oil instead!|`|j3wIFjEhaa	its bad if it gets in u-know-where but other than that it should be fine|`|Lq2psnTqaa	No that's fine. External means outside of your body. Just don't swallow any.|`|7025a6c6a18e110fc5a6cbaa84055a0baa	It's probally fine until it starts hurting.

60X8rtcDaa	No :) But there are things you can do to reduce your dimples:<br>  <br>   - avoid fast food and sodas<br>   - massage your problem areas<br>   - scrub your problem areas (coffee ground scrubs work pretty well and cost nothing)<br>   - use a contrast shower<br>   - go for some body wrapping procedures.<br>  <br>  Combined all together, these will make your cellulite invisible in several weeks - guaranteed! :).

Eat nothing but uncooked, whole fruit for 2 weeks.. stick mainly to apples, grapefruit, cucumber, tomatos, pineapple, blaclberries, blueberries, rapsberries, and cherries. You can eat other fruits as well, just in moderation.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	no

sq9VgEhNaa	The longer you wear contact lenses the dryer they will become since they have been out of solution for a long time. You can buy eye drops specifically for this purpose! |`|hS4QH26maa	Contact lenses will get dry when it stays too long. Just put some re-wetting drops on and that'll be fine. Your eyes will, hopefully, not be dry afterwards. |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	because your eyes are closed and you are not blinking frequently, which passes more fresh eye juice over your eyeballs....
Ytu9ItaMaa	absolutely not......read your box of tampons.....or the insert that comes with it.....it should tell you the symptoms.....you would have a super high fever and be severly sick.....and it happens rather quickly...not over weeks......|`|P7iJPlEkaa	I don't think so, but I would still recommend seeing your doc. 
WkA8UPflaa	There is a good chance. I would go get your blood tested. I did and I had hypoglycemia and you can get glucose tablets if that is all you have, its very easy to control. But you need to get a blood checker so you know for sure, and go to a doctor<br>  |`|AA10216571	 Simple answer, Just go to the doctor, get tested and put your mind at ease. It's just a simple blood test.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	How do you know you get high and low blood sugar?  Are you testing?<br>  Fourteen year olds are moody as a rule, so that's not a symptom of anything.  Type 2 comes at any age, particularly if you are overweight and inactive.<br>  Cold hands, dizziness - you could be anemic.  The dizziness could also be low blood pressure.<br>  Yeh, you could have diabetes, but I doubt it.  The test is the only way to be sure.
hyGSMcIyaa	Certainly, it is possible that there is connection. There are several types of headaches, and one of them comes from muscle cramps in cranial arteries. The heart is all muscle, so it could also experience a kind of transitory cramping.  All of this usually starts with electrolyte levels that are not normal. The result is inflammation, which then brings on other problems.<br>  <br>  Stress is usually a trigger, but not necessarily the cause. Lowering stress is always good to do, but not necessarily enough.<br>  <br>  You should have an ekg evaluated by a cardiologist, and follow any prescribed treatments.<br>  <br>  You really need to get a fully balanced nutritional supplement program. It can help balance your electrolytes and also reduce inflammation. Dr. Ray Strand has had good results with many situations like yours.|`|kOcBv8Tcaa	I cannot tell you if your heart pain is connected to your headaches but you should go and check it out by a doctor. My husband has been having heart pains and numb left arm, but luckily it was only because of anxiety. Still, if your heart hurts go to the doc just to make sure your heart is ok. |`|SOR9WXiSaa	Could be a sign of stress. Takes it easy.|`|eae5e0ed54bc696c1f934d5fda7fe5bdaa	Ahhh.....It could very well be a case of irregular heartbeat, or a palpitation. When the heart contracts or lack their of it will feel like a ice pick is being driven into your chest very fast yet slow. If you can understand that. The heart is tricky due to numerous chemicals and electrical signals that interfere with one another. Think of it this way if you heart misses a beat then it has to time it just right to continue to work and uses a larger electrical signal from your body to do so. In a off beat heart it could mean that two chambers squeeze together to force Fluid in opposing directions. Squeeze a water ballon in the middle and you will no what I mean!

a98MpjZ9aa	You have a mild case of it.  If your mother knew that I don't think it would make much difference.  Even if you tell her she probably won't believe you,<br>  <br>  Why don't you take the A.Q test and show her the results:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/...</a><br>  <br>  I scored 32.  Severe cases usually score in the 40's.  If you score below twenty, though, you aren't autistic enough to be diagnosed.  <br>  <br>  |`|ZzCVysPiaa	I don't think autism just pops up like that and I am pretty sure if your were in fact autistic, she would have known by now.|`|Vu3J4e0saa	You haven't got autism, it's something you are born with and would have shown up long before now and your mother would have certainly been aware of it as would your doctor.<br>  Why don't you explain your symptoms and perhaps someone will be able to point you in the right direction.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	you don.t have autism..........|`|7SJEwp9yaa	What makes you think you have Autism. My son has Autism and I can tell you it's not just something that you catch one day!

I will call it normal if you are in the age of 30 to 40 odd.|`|tS4t9Lndaa	Yes it's high, I'm surprised he didn't at least remark about it, You should think about  purchasing your own automatic BP cuff. I went through years of "it's just a little high"or "we'll keep an eye on it". When I had an echo my ventricle was enlarged and the cardiologist stated it was from my hypertension. Now on medications it is completely under control.BP cuffs you find in stores are unreliable because they are not properly maintain. So for peace of mind, buy your own and I tell you how to use it  Take care, Donna|`|5LpDrsvFaa	 Well, the most important pressure is the diastolic in this case you have 94 and you are right is a little bit high, so you must stop eating salt in your meals and you should do some exercise, if you are over weight try to loss some pounds and finally before take any pill check you blood pressure daily for 1 week and if you pressure is high 3 or more days is time to consult a doctor bye.........|`|fys4qM9Faa	Yes, this is high. Normal blood pressure is 110-120/70. Try avoiding foods that raise blood pressure (those high in salt) and including foods that lower blood pressure (those high in potassium).|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	94 is high.........133 is a bit  high.............do you get nervous at doctors appointments? some peoples bp rises when at the docs|`|dc0pgWjZaa	Depends on your age.<br>  
gSo4dR7oaa	Symptoms would not show up so soon.  You should get tested for HIV and other STDs.  It may take up to 3 months, or in rare cases, up to 6 months, for antibodies to show up on an HIV test.|`|T5VDX4tEaa	Please educate yourself on HIV and don't get into hot and heavy situations with people you barely know without having the STD talk.<br>  <br>  I'm offended for "English backpacker" because you automatically assumed that she had HIV. Wow. Pregnancy wasn't on your mind? You should get tested on a regular basis whether you're sexually active or not because the virus has a dormant period.<br>  <br>  Your tonsils are probably swollen because of some sort of cold or flu like virus.|`|qb3QVTR2aa	*shakes head* go get tested|`|vbGuwsIPaa	Did she look slutty?|`|3cDK1HaQaa	Yes, swollen tonsils combined with fatigue are common symptoms.

Good Luck xx|`|jTdNcOYqaa	I would strongly calm down and relax yourself and make an apptment in 3 months to get tested for hiv . In rare cases mostly hiv infection does't show anti-bodies 6-9 months.

There are a few that don't -- usually that indicates ... problems ... I've only known two males in my life that didn't masturbate, and both had psychological difficulties.<br>  <br>  The simplest way to masturbate is just to play with and rub your penis, rubbing it up and down until it feels really good and you orgasm.  some people use lubricant, others use different positions.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|I8MUpN04aa	not all guys masturbate, but a lot do. some people even live a celibate life until they die. its all a matter of personal choice. for a man to masturbate, he just has to hold his hand in a C shape, and move it back and forth down the length of his penis. that's all.|`|DdUmku2oaa	I'm not going to corrupt you by teaching you how to masturbate.

If you get good and hard while masturbating or watching porn or whatever, then it is almost certainly psychological. <br>  <br>  Another possibility is that you masturbate too much and although you get hard enough to masturbate it's not hard enough for penetration.

Yohimbe/Yohimbine is the only FDA approved herb.  Many guys find it helpful, but it can have side effects.

The most common growths, fibroadenomas, are somewhat more common in women in their 20's and in women of African descent. They usually feel round and firm and have smooth borders. They may move a little under the fingers, be tender, and change with the menstrual cycle.

A woman may have just one or several lipomas at once.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cysts are fluid-filled sacs in the breast. They feel smooth or rubbery and move about under the fingers. They can be quite painful or tender, or they may be painless. Cysts are caused by the hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Cysts are rare in women older than 50 and are not related to breast cancer. If you have a cyst, your health professional may drain (aspirate) it to help relieve the pain and confirm the diagnosis. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sebaceous cysts are caused by plugged ducts at the site of a hair follicle. Like a cyst, they move freely under the fingers. Hormone stimulation or injury may cause them to enlarge. A sebaceous cyst that does not cause symptoms does not require medical treatment.

There are people who enjoy seeing naked men and women and porn serves them too. Why do people enjoy seeing 'porn' again there are so many reasons it would be wrong to generalize. I have enjoyed 'porn' for over thirty years. I do not feel that it has harmed me. I do not have an increased desire to rape because I have never had a desire to rape. I do not feel exploited because I make the choice to buy or not to buy. I can take it or leave it. I do not enjoy bondage or sadomasochistic images. I enjoy straight forward pictures of naked women and sometimes men and women together. The naked body is a beautiful thing. I do think about the people in the images and I wonder why they are doing what they are doing, but I cannot reach a conclusion about they motivation. <br>  <br>  You could ask the question what is the purpose of prostitution or boxing.    |`|qzpQdJ44aa	We, especially men get aroused by watching sexually explicit materials.

Other purposes could be as follows:<br>  - MONEY!!!!  $$$$ (the people making and distributing porn are making money from every copy they sell)<br>  - Some would argue that it's purpose is to degrade women<br>  - Some would argue that it's purpose is to degrade men<br>  - Some would argue that it is an expression of art (I don't see what's so tasteful in watching a man sexually degrade a woman with some of the lude and vulgar acts they portray in some porn, but, to each their own)<br>  - Some would argue that it's purpose is just as an expression of "freedom of speech"<br>  - Some would argue that it's purpose is purely animalistic in nature and serves the human curiosity<br>  - Some would argue that it serves as an educational tool<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful, but in my opinion, my first answer would be of my opinion.  There are many arguments and debates on the purpose of porn, but, as a mid 30's male in the US, I feel that it's main purpose is for arousal and stimulation of the human sexual core as long as it is in "good taste" and not belittling and degrading.|`|1Y3NWzYOaa	I would consider porn as educational as you get to learn a lot, new positions which you could try, satisfying your partner etc. Yes it is entertaining as well and the most important is to get aroused and charged up for the actual act.|`|S5wRqmqPaa	its a form of adultry....ultimately ...|`|2bVxBCgzaa	To make the people involved lots of money.

mOS25E5Haa	I used to masturbate the EXACT same way as him, only I thought I was the only one in the world who did it that way. And when it came to anything else but rubbing against something like the top of my bed or a rug on the floor, I could not ejaculate or orgasm.<br>  <br>  After awhile, I decided to start experimenting with different methods of pleasuring myself. At first, this was extremely difficult. I could get it up and keep it up with my hands, but could not orgasm by rubbing it, stroking it, or touching it with them. Also, I noticed that my penis, as a whole, was not very sensitive to pleasure without the bed/carpet stimulation. Eventually, over the course of a few days and some long, laborious attempts, I experienced the orgasm of a lifetime.<br>  <br>  Shortly thereafter, my entire way of experiencing pleasure changed. That is, *I could orgasm and ejaculate very easily without having to rub up against anything, and by only using my hands. All in all, my penis was more sensitive.*<br>  <br>  So my advice to you is this: advise your boyfriend to masturbate (by himself) only using his hands. That is, he should not rub up against anything and whatnot. Then, once he has orgasmed a couple of times without the aide of his bed, try having sex again. His penis, by then, should be more sensitive to sexual stimulation.<br>  <br>  If this does not do it, then he should probably see a urologist, as the problem is with him, even though it affects the two of you. But I think that this should help, because it helped me.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I wish you guys the best of luck!|`|rLsphyqhaa	Give these things a try. You on top until you reach what you want. then because he has not gotten his O you can help him out. Hold onto his penis with your hand begin to stroke it, take your other hand and rub the little spot between his balls and anus. You could put your finger inside him but most guys don't like that unless they are into prostate massaging. anyway continue to rub the area as you go up and down he should soon bust one out. If not both of you can enjoy it. You could try the oral thing also, most guys do enjoy that. As you are given him oral rub that are hold his balls suck on now and then, sooner or later it is going to bust loose. |`|xdo49r2iaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You have the problem of  delayed ejaculation.  Delayed ejaculation refers to an inhibition of ejaculation. The man is unable to ejaculate, either during intercourse, or with manual stimulation in the presence of a partner. <br>  <br>  The cause    <br>  <br>  Most men ejaculate within 2 to 4 minutes after onset of active thrusting in intercourse. Men with retarded ejaculation may be entirely unable to ejaculate in some circumstances (for example, during intercourse), or may only be able to ejaculate with great effort and after prolonged intercourse (for example 30 to 45 minutes). The most common causes are psychological. Common psychological causes include: <br>  <br>  <br>  A strict religious background causing the person to view sex as sinful <br>  <br>  Lack of attraction for a partner <br>  <br>  Conditioning caused by unique or atypical masturbation patterns <br>  <br>  Traumatic events (for example learning that one's partner is having an affair) <br>  <br>  Organic causes are also possible; a variety of drugs may sometimes impair ejaculation. <br>  <br>  Neurological diseases may also cause delayed or an inability to ejaculate such as strokes and nerve damage to the spinal cord or back.<br>      <br>  <br>  If the man is unable to ejaculate in a reasonable length of time with some form of stimulation (as with masturbation), it is a good indicator .<br>  <br>  Pl. contact doctor.|`|diq9htpuaa	I had a similar problem.        I was unable to reach orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  Finally, after years, I discovered that I had more than the usual loss of sensitivity because of male genital mutilation aka circumcision.<br>  This caused nerve damage which in my case exceeded the usual 50%.<br>  <br>  I found out about foreskin restoraton, which has vastly increased my sexual sensitivity and dramatically increased the intensity of my orgasms.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs more intense stimulation than the vagina can provide, and masturbation stimulates the penis more intensely in just the right areas with just the right pressures.<br>  <br>  Restoring his foreskin will heighten his sensitivity, but it's not quick or easy, taking several years to accomplish.<br>  <br>  Thousands of guys are restoring now, and just type in foreskin restoration on your browser and you will see many devices, techniques and support sites.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Seems like his penis is used to achieving orgasm only by rubbing against the bed.  If he continues doing so, he'd never get rid of his habit!<br>  <br>  The thing that you guys gotta do is 'untrain' his penis to this form of stimulation.  You should proceed to having sex as usual.  If he cannot orgasm, that's fine.  Don't let him orgasm the rubbing way.  <br>  <br>  The next day you guys proceed to having sex again, on the second or third time, he'd definitely end up ejaculating while having sex.<br>  <br>  And yes the morning erections are a normal things.  All normal guys wake up with 1. |`|BicCDOllaa	His problem is how he learned to get off by rubbing against his bed. He has gotten used to that sensation and the only way to get off now.

He should try to refrain from ejaculating this way.  It will frustrate him, but it could be enough to re-train his psysical pleasure response mechanisms.  Might take several attempts, but can usually be accomplished with support and encouragement from you.  There is also specualation that some men with this problem have a deep-seated fear of totally 'giving themselves' to a partner.  This might be best discussed with a male therapist, if that possibility is suspected.  Good luck.|`|XWy54gpSaa	Be glad he can last that long..most guys can't last more than 8 minutes and the pleasure is beter longer..<br>  <br>  I have the same problem also I am female and it take me too long to "finish".<br>  <br>  I never finished with my boyfriend penis sliding in and out I always have to be on top rubbing my puss to finish..<br>  <br>  I don't know why...|`|P61qcNdvaa	Look up "delayed ejaculation"  - and be glad he can last that long, most can't.

CjPVSNu1aa	You're addicted to caffeine, so just find another form to take it in. I would suggest a caffeine supplement such as a pill or the like. Be cautious with pills and only take the amount directed. Taking too many can make you jittery and mess with your heart (racing, palpatations, etc.) Try to stay away from energy drinks as they are very unhealthy. Don't go with sodas either. The caffeine content is lower in sodas so drinking more to make up for it is not healthy. |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	caffeine pills.........try some tea possibly......caffeinated water.......energy drink......folgers makes a low acid coffee.....|`|SAUrYW0Daa	You can't substitute the caffeine...but you ought to wean yourself off the coffee.<br>  Start by mixing it with decaf; then change totally to decaf & then stop completely...that way you will avoid caffeine headaches.  The irritability, fatigue & inability to concentrate will disappear.<br>  <br>  Drink carob beverages.  Drink noncaffeinated teas.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Oo4Vl2feaa	Go to sleep earlier. That really solves it. The problem is falling asleep earlier.<br>  <br>  Get knockout pills until your inner clock adjusts itself for earlier sleep maybe. Worked for me.

Have you ever had thrush (bacterial/yeast infection)? I don't think you can ever completely get rid of it, and certain things trigger an "attack". For me it was periods or antibiotics.|`|ygohg2Iyaa	Yeah, it can be caused by blood left over. Just wash more carefully in the shower next time (with a little soap). Also your hormones can be a little off balance and that can cause irritation.|`|4jhM8dataa	It could be a reaction to the type of pads or tampons you are using...try another brand and see if you get the same reaction
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I took Zoloft 75 mg for almost a year five years ago.  It was prescribed due to the sudden death of a family member.  (That's another story.)  Anyway, actually, I didn't feel anything.  I didn't cry, didn't know if I had brushed my teeth, didn't know if I had eaten, DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING  bad or good.  I stopped taking it to face up the disaster in my life, cried, was depressed, pulled my bookstraps up and got on with my life like the deceased person would have wanted me to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|74vjztxTaa	I am taking Effexor XL, the first thing I noticed was that I got a lot calmer and really cut down on getting so angry about things that upset me at work.

My doctor said this is when people really get depressed because days are so much shorter and dreary weather.  My husband noticed a change after about 5 days and I was not crying anymore and very optimistic.  My Mother could tell the change in my voice was so much happier than before.  My doctor put me on Zoloft and it worked great (I would cut the pill into quarters, it didn't take much).

It is like diabetes.  The body is malfunctioning.  In the case of BP it is mishandling neurotransmitters that effect mood.  That can be treated by medications that manage the release or reuptake of the neurotransmiters to balance them out.  Also with therapy to help with learning to manage moods.  But it can not be cured|`|B0z4a5zvaa	There is no cure for Bipolar Disorder.<br>  <br>  I have been on the medication (Depakote at one point, Lithium at another point) and I know how you feel. I will never take it again. The fog is simply unbearable. To the person who claimed negatives about the meds are just "scaremongering"... it may have worked for you, but it made me a grossly overweight zombie and added several health conditions including several muscle injuries due to added weight despite diet and excersize. I wouldn't trust anything that requires being monitored so closely. They check the levels of the chemical in your system every month to ensure that it hasn't become toxic.<br>  <br>  I have found an herbal supplement that I like called Bach's Rescue Remedy. For me, it acts as an as-needed mild sedative. It doesn't make me groggy but it takes the edge off when I'm feeling too intense, without draining all the color out of the world. It's really nothing more than a carefully balanced combination of flower extracts.<br>  <br>  Daily routine is essential, but not in the 6am, wake up... 605 get in shower... 618 get out of shower kind of way. Simply going to bed and getting out of bed at the same time every day can help a lot. I actually find it extremely difficult to do even that, but it's the most I can do for myself without being drugged. I wish you and/or your loved one the best of luck with this horrible condition.|`|GIL8UWQQaa	Unfortunately, there is no actual CURE for this disorder - it is a lifelong thing, although the severity can go up or down throughout your life. The best thing to do is one of the following;<br>  <br>  A) Learn to live with the symptoms and accept it as who you are... I know if I wasn't bipolar, I wouldn't know who I was anymore. It's become a part of me. I accept it.<br>  <br>  B) Try to reduce the symptoms as much as possible. This can be done through a combination of medication and therapy. Please don't be afraid to try medication - it has worked very well for me in the past... it's so difficult to try to battle this disorder on your own and much of the negative things you hear about medication is just people scaremongering... there's simply no evidence for it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped to answer your question and if you or someone you know is bipolar, I wish you all the best. Try to look at the diagnosis as a positive one - now you know what the problem is, it's much easier to find ways to deal with it.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	you don.t|`|TAx7u5uYaa	There is no cure to bipolar disorder and every person with bipolar disorder is different. Bipolar disorder can be compared to high blood pressure or diabetes. It is a life long condition that has to be carefully monitored and treated thoughout a person's lifetime. Usually with bipolar disorder, you have to have medication, therapy and a healthy diet. Hope this helps! t.

Also go to a gym that you like and get a personal trainer that can help you design an exercise plan that works for you and help you design a diet plan that works for you so that you could stick to it. Lypo might sound great but it doesn't keep you thin. You can get fat even after it. Take the money and work with someone who can be there to support you.

People can be addicted to gambling, sex, food...the hardest part is to try to avoid the temptations.|`|9RHad77Taa	I think among younger people, a lot of it is due to peer pressure or being rebellious. A lot start on soft drugs, find that it's not giving them the same effects as it did when they first tried it out, and turn to harder drugs.<br>  Others turn to drugs as a way of escape from the real world, if they are having a low or lonely point in their life. <br>  It could also be to do with family problems too.|`|5DOkJVzlaa	I do/have done about everything there is.

Please call your DR's office or ER and ask how long you should stay out. <br>  <br>  I worked in a nursing home and when patients returned from the hospital with mrsa they were in quarantine for at least a week, so please ask a medical professional.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	call ur doctor.............mrsa is a pretty strong bug and takes a while to get rid of even while taking antibiotics......also depends on where the mrsa is........on a wound??? keep it clean and covered......in your urine???? etc........wash your hands very well after touching the area of infection........|`|FYwc4pC1aa	35 years

You are completely safe. Have lots of sex without a condom. It helps if you have an open wound on your dong. That way the blood will fight off the disease.

bb8740cbd7c94be820535e8abb6199fcaa	Some people believe that any foreign substance in the body is toxic.  Over the years root canal filling material has been tested, checked, changed and improved making them much more safe, bio-compatible and non-toxic.  Years ago when silver points were used, yes they were known to leak, rust and some were corrosive making them undesirable.  But the point is, the tooth was saved keeping it functional and pain free and no one has died or developed a deadly disease from a root canal filling material.  I would trust your dentist to take care of your teeth, after all he is a doctor of dentistry with required continued education and knows so much more than your well meaning but uneducated friends.   |`|eK9NTFUXaa	no more to say after heather ..<br>  <br>  
TcR4EJjHaa	The flu vaccine only potentially protects against the flu.<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus aka stomach virus/flu is not a flu at all.<br>  <br>  Info on Norwalk virus:<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes and sudden watery diarrhea and/or vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  Myths<br>  <br>  It is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to get infected in any of the following ways:<br>  <br>  1. Being “near” someone who has it, including co-workers or friends<br>  2. Being on a plane with people who have it<br>  3. Breathing the same air as someone who has it<br>  4. Being in the same building as someone who has it<br>  5. Walking past a pool of vomit on the floor, road or sidewalk<br>  6. Through having sexual relations with an infected person<br>  7. Through a cut in your skin<br>  8. Through your rectum or genitalia (as in, on a toilet)<br>  9. Kissing someone who is not yet showing symptoms (note: it may be possible to catch it from someone who has recently vomited by kissing them, as viral particles may be in their mouth from vomitus. But the virus is NOT transmitted through saliva)<br>  10. Number 6, above, applies similarly to sharing cups or utensils with someone as well.<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay healthy.:)<br>  <br>  |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	the cdc decides which strains of the flu will be the most hard hitting and common for the season each year........the flu shot vaccinates against those strains........it does not protect you from strains of the flu which are not included in the flu..........it will not protect you from illnesses which are not the flu.......|`|Mr5cUBBwaa	No. It works by giving you a mild version of the flu, which gives your immune system a chance to develop a defence against it.

The muscles around your airways tighten even more than usual, going into what is known as bronchospasm. The inner lining of the airways swell and become irritated. At the same time, your airways produce large amounts of mucus that make breathing even more difficult.<br>  The best way to prevent an asthma attack is to avoid your triggers as much as possible.<br>  <br>  It's also important to learn how to recognize what might be known as your "early warning signs" of an impending asthma attack. These are symptoms that happen just before an asthma attack begins. They tell you that your condition is about to worsen, or get out of control.<br>  They might include things such as a frequent cough, especially during the nighttime hours, getting short of breath more easily, increased peak flow meter readings, feeling extra tired when you're active, a change in mood toward the negative, and trouble sleeping. You might also notice signs of a cold, such as nasal stuffiness, sore throat, sneezing, or runny nose.<br>  <br>  If you notice any of these symptoms, take action quickly to prevent an asthma attack. Good luck with your asthma :-)

Not only is a hysterectomy a big change for your body but for your mind also. I was 20 when I had my first child, but I've always had horrible periods and even my pregnancy was "high risk." After I had my daughter the Dr.'s wanted me to have a hysterectomy and I refused, I knew I wanted more kids down the road and I did not want that decision dictated for me. Eight yrs. later I still have refused the surgery and it has even come to the point that one of my OB's refuses to see me anymore because I almost died during delivery of my oldest daughter. It's a battle constantly! We have two girls now but I'm still not sure that we're done having children, we will eventually draw the line soon (we want one more.) But also, I have HORRIBLE periods and really don't want to deal with that anymore. But being told at such a young age you have to have a LIFE CHANGING surgery, it's tough to say the least. I opt every year to waite longer. I can suffer physically during my period but i don't want my choices ripped away from me. I know this doesn't help you..... but maybe you'll feel you're not alone?!? It's for sure a very hard decision to make... and not to be taken lightly... my husband and I prayed about it, and I know that a lot of people probably think that we are selfish... that we have two beautiful healthy girls... why put yourself at risk again? But people don't understand what kind of a decision it is, and how hard it is to decide what's best for you and your family. Ultimately it's your body, you decide what you can take and what you can't!

aOSreXQCaa	You can take a plastic bag, ie.Ziplock, and cut it to be bigger than your stiched area, and use medical tape, and tape the plastic to your skin. You will need to be sure and not put the tape too close to the stich, and it may come out, and you also need to know if you are allergic to tape (but from having the surgery you shuld know about the allergy). You can also use a shower head that you can position where you need it, like the one's you can hold in your hand. I would look at your discharge orders, because you should be able to get them wet, as long as you don't submerge the stitches in water for a long period of time. If you have a question about the first idea, feel free to e-mail me!|`|VeVHY7OOaa	We tell our patients in the ER not to get them wet for the first 24 hours (I totally agree with the plastic bag idea).  After the 24 hours, you can get them wet as long as you're not SOAKING them (ie, baths).  You'll be fine as long as you let the water run off the wound area, then make sure it's nice & dry (this minimizes the bacteria that can get in).  We usually tell people not to keep them covered (even after a shower) after the 24 hrs, but in your case I'd be kinda worried about them rubbing against your clothing & irritating the wound.  I'd personally wear loose-fitting clothing until the stitches come out.  Good luck!|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	cut a piece of saran wrap to fit over the area.........get medical tape......not the paper tape kind......medipore|`|N92P1T3Qaa	As described it is not so much the sutures (stitches) as much as it is the wound itself that you want to prevent to get wet. In between the sutures that allows the skin to gap and increases risk of infection and improper healing. <br>  <br>  Alike other described covering with plastic or better yet, sponge bath until the wound has better healed. <br>  <br>  Good luck |`|5ivV39Foaa	My husband had the same problem.  I took a zip lock bag and taped it all the way around and the wound and it did not get wet when I removed it after the shower.

You have at least 6 more years of it and there will be many growth spurts along the way.  No two people mature at the same age nor at the same time in their lives - nor does everything fall into place all at once.  There will be changes going on like more growth in arms, legs, feet, hands, penis length, torso, facial feature changes, voice changes, growth of body hair, pubic hair, facial hair.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  You must learn to be patient.  It will all come to conclusion in due time.|`|hCf83BWlaa	You're just in the beginning. |`|AA11235749	You are in the beginning phase of puberty. your body is going be changed slowly.|`|wrGjTJ8Laa	beginning stages be patient|`|nXaGxuV3aa	i got my pubes before armpit hair your in the begining you got lots of time to grow|`|GahiILuCaa	do u have fully grown pubic hair? if so then u are only a little way in it

Since the heart and lungs are two of the most important organs in the body, any safe activity that exercises them is good for your general health.<br>  <br>  Other studies have found that frequent masturbation reduces the risk of prostate cancer - a doctor who studied the evidence recommended that teenagers masturbate at least six times a week. It is thought that regular ejaculation clears the prostate gland of chemicals that can cause cancer.<br>  <br>  How often? Jackinworld did a survey of its readers aged 11 to 19 and obtained the following results:<br>  <br>  Average Masturbation Frequencies by Age:<br>  11: 11.1 times per week<br>  12: 9.4<br>  13: 10.6<br>  14: 10.6<br>  15: 9.9<br>  16: 9.6<br>  17: 9.4<br>  18: 8.5<br>  19: 9.3<br>  <br>  Remember these are averages - some will masturbate more often, some less.<br>  <br>  This is worth reading - be sure to read it ALL THROUGH, as the beginning is a bit confusing:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jackinworld.com/bios/bio233.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jackinworld.com/bios/bio233.h...</a>|`|AA11290450	Difficult to answer.<br>  As far as we know there are no serious long term side effects if you do it to a reasonably degree. I assume you can injure yourself if you do it too often (that guy who posted above - is that true? I think you need to see a doctor!).<br>  <br>  I would say, don't think about it too much, just do what comes naturally and you should be fine. Also just remember you don't HAVE to do it, not everybody does, but lets face it, most people do!<br>  <br>  For a more substantial answer, I have heard that during orgasm, large amounts acetyl choline are released in the brain, and this neurotransmitter has been linked to poorer memory - but it's not permanent - you just might not have the best memory if you do it four times a day, but once you stop, your memory should return to normal. Of course this would be a side-effect of sex as well, but given that having four orgasms a day would be COMPLETELY draining, I think the last concern you'd have is a slightly inefficient memory!<br>  <br>  A more substantial concern is addiction. Just make sure, like I said above, that you do whatever comes naturally to you, and don't just start doing it all the time until it consumes your whole life. In this respect, be careful of pornography - I recommend you masturbate, WITHOUT any visual assistance - that way you'll only really do it when your body feels like it and you're much less likely to get addicted! Having said that you won't definitely get addicted if you do look at porn, most people seem to be able to deal with it fine.<br>  <br>  Funky|`|RqEGVTmKaa	well in my experiance anything less than 3 times a day is safe, but one i had a mishap...<br>  after spending too much time infront of the computer and many snotty tissues later, i found that i could no longer produce seamen, i was worried so i tried again, this time i produced a large discharge of blood and puss, this has been an afliction ever since |`|AzV4Oze3aa	Well, they say that if you do it too much you will go blind or hair will start growing in the palm of your hand.  But take it from me, thats an old wives tale, cause I ain't blind and there's no hair growing in my hand.  Besides that, this is terrific exercise for the wrist.|`|dFrFnoEGaa	Yes it is Healthy and you should do it at least 15 to 25 times a day or you are not normal and will only be left behind in life and love.<br>  
Y0MpSTkXaa	If you're finding live insect-like creatures in your stool. I strongly urge you visit a doctor as that would mean you've got a parasitic infection.

I don't think you're crazy or psycho, but since this is bothering you it's probably best that you talk to a professional about it. Although medication may be helpful, it's likely that there are mental techniques that you can use before bed or when you wake up that will help you keep your waking world and your dreams separate. If there's a counseling center on your campus it may be free, making it a good place to start.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Your chances of being fertile or infertile, or being able to carry a pregnancy full term depend on exactly how extensive the septum is.  There are cases where women have normal pregnancies, while in others they have repeated miscarriages because the embryo implants in the septum or the space available is not sufficient to allow full term growth.  You will really have to consult with a fertility specialist to have answers to your questions, unfortunately.  I also suggest you see one before you try to conceive, since there are some treatments that might increase your odds of success.  I couldn't tell you the odds of such an occurrence, either.  I have seen it before, but I wouldn't say it was that common.  But also considering you have the thyroid problem, I'd say you really should see the fertility specialist first, and then decide what's best to do next.  If there is sufficient space, and one side is larger than the other, it may be in vitro would be an option to help the odds of a baby implanting correctly in the right spot.  I believe I read once that there is a genetic component in this condition.   It might be possible that your mothers also have the condition, but it has not been detected.  That might explain why you each have a twin that did not survive.  I know it sounds crazy, but  years ago I assisted with the hysterectomy on a lady who had had three children and her bicornate uterus was not detected until after she developed problems with fibroid tumors and an ultrasound was done.  So I know it doesn't automatically eliminate the possibility of motherhood.  She had also had numerous miscarriages as well, and they felt that was the reason.  She had the children in the 60's and early 70's, before ultrasound became widely used.  But to know your chances, you will need an expert in the field.|`|AA10295089	-Sigh- Well, you are as my girlfriend is, And we have been unable to have kids yet.. However you can get lucky!

That said, please don't stick hairbrushes inside yourself.  This is just asking for trouble in the way of a bacterial infection in your vagina.  As to why you can't get deep, you are still tight down there obviously.  It will take a while before you open up fully.  In the meantime, just stick to safe things (like clean fingers).  Good luck!

It's when your heart rate goes way up.  |`|cfc6c0f015d8ca942aaceca074dfb71aaa	I would like to comment on joes comment. atrioventricular disassociation was the old term for 3rd degree heart block or complete heart block, not ventricular tachycardia. VT is caused be an irritable foci in the ventricules that is causing the rapid heart rate and the fibrillation threshold is very low. The intrinsic rate for the ventricles, is 30-40 bpm. AV disassociation( 3rd degree ) has an atrial rate that is normal and a ventricle rate that is normal. There is no P-wave relationship with the QRS. This patient needs a pacer and a person with VT requires oxygen, IV meds and probable sync cardioversion and in the case of pulseless VT - defibrillation and CPR as per ACLS Protocol. |`|5hMWtKMoaa	Just to clarify, for anyone interested, during ventricular tachycardia, the upper chambers or atria are attempting to contract. This can be seen on ECG's and in fact is a hallmark of ventricular tachycardia - atrioventricular dissociation. Furthermore, there can be occasional beats that are appropriately conducted from the atria to the ventricles in the form of fusion or capture beats, other tell-tale signs of ventricular tachycardia.|`|IDWwJgu5aa	it means that your ventricals are beating very fast without syncronizing with you atria. in fact your atrium are not beating at all and if sustained it can be fatal|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	ur ventricles are working really fast and your heartbeat will be very high......

A lot can depend on what type of socks, nylons, and shoes you're wearing. <br>  <br>   If you have a problem with this, try brewing some regular, strong tea, add a few quarts of warm water and soak your feet for half an hour.  The tea tightens up your sweat glands in your feet.  You should also change your shoes each day so you're not wearing the same shoes day after day.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	not i|`|ecNrg1OPaa	Not unless they have a foot fungus.  The best cure for foot odor is to spray your feet and shoes everyday with alcohol when you put them on.  My brother came home from the Navy with super smelly feet.  The kind that you gag when they take their shoes off.  So I got him a bottle of 90% rubbing alcohol (under 2 dollars)  and a small spray bottle (under 4 dollars).  He was told to spray his feet or find different lodgings because I did not want to catch it!<br>  So spray feet, put socks on, spray shoes, put them on, done!  Takes a while to work all the way (month) because the shoes stink for some time.  But it does work beautifully.
48zW12Llaa	My wisdom teeth came in when I was 15-my sons came in when they were 15 & 16, so it IS a possiblity- If you both go to the dentist regularly, have mom or dad give them a call and see if they can get her in for a checkup, she may also have a cavity-sometimes pain can be felt in a different area especially  in the mouth.|`|eK9NTFUXaa	It could be the wisdom tooth ..<br>  the age of the eruption of the wisdoms is 17-22<br>  <br>  but you may see an old man (50 yo) with no wisdom ..<br>  <br>  or .. as your sister .. it could erupt earlier .. <br>  <br>  thats all ..!!<br>  |`|qPbrv7qHaa	I got my first at 19, but im told the age can vary from teenage onwards|`|0mHi3S2Raa	it could be her 12 year molars coming in, its possible that they're just coming in late. but it could be her wisdom teeth too, go to the dentist and get it checked out.
de2a020c9428ecde71ab9357585ee7b4aa	The only reason you ever need have concern about your (resting) blood-pressure figures are IF THEY  CHANGE. .<br>  <br>  If they simply are constant the numbers don't mean anything (in spite of the tosh you read here about "Stage 1" and Stage 2" etc. - all complete nonsense.,)<br>  <br>  Why are you worried? Your systolics are not anything unusual and your diastolics are perfect. You don't state your age, but you sound as if you're in your forties or fifty's? or else, if you're younger than this, then overweight.. <br>  Can you Edit your posting and give more details? I mean, your BP's go up and down in a cycle, all day and night long. It's not the "average" that matters. What is the range of your real readings, over the 24 hrs?<br>  |`|Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi centerbe,<br>  <br>  Don't worry. The reading is fine, the top end of normal. Absolutely no need to get all worked up as that WILL make it go higher. I wish my BP was as normal as yours!!!<br>  <br>  It is the diastolic reading which is the one to be concerned about (bottom figure) In a healthy adult anything from 60 - 80 is considered normal.<br>  <br>  The top figure is the pressure in your blood vessels when the heart is pumping blood out into your aorta and around your body. The bottom reading is the pressure when the heart is resting between beats.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will simply record your BP reading and ask you some questions about your lifestyle. Even if it were excessively high your doctor would only give you medication to lower it. It is easily fixed and quite honestly with your reading I very much doubt that even medication is necessary.<br>  <br>  Please don't worry!!! I do know what I am talking about honestly!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.|`|AA12054958	Technically you are classified as Stage 1 Hypertension (see chart below).  Many people would love to have your blood pressure levels with out taking medication.  Usually a doctor is not too concerned until your bottom number gets up to 90.  Depending on other factors, changes in diet and exercise will help lower your blood pressure.  Your doctor also may do a blood test to check levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.  It's good that you have an appointment with your doc, he's the best person to answer your questions.  (Unlike the "wanna be") doc below me.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	its high enough to be a cause for concern...........you were smart in making a doctors appt.........outcome may include dietary and excercise changes or even medication.........don.t worry too much just take care of your body.....
Ytu9ItaMaa	there are differences in the circulatory system which allow the blood to bypass the lungs since they are not being used for respiration while in utero.......this hole which allows it closes at or shortly after birth....
fk9AvB25aa	Yes there is always a small risk of passing herpes on even if there are no out breaks.<br>  He still has the virus in his body regardless of how many or how long he has gone between out breaks. <br>  As long as he is on some sort of regular suppressive therapy and is NEVER having sex when he gets the slightest signs of an out break and is honest with you about if or when he get symptoms then you should be ok.<br>  You should know that herpes can be passed on even with protected sex since condoms don't cover all of the areas of the genitals that herpes can affect. Herpes doesn't always break out on the shaft. It can affect the testicles and the areas between that and the anus as well as the buttocks and inner thighs.<br>  There could be a small chance that he passed it onto you. If your worried then get checked out and tested for herpes. There should be enough antibodies in your system by now to give you an accurate result via blood test.<br>  I know my boy friend hasn't cheated on me and I ended up getting oral and genital herpes from him.|`|FXKAGVZGaa	Yes, it is very possible for a virus to lie dormant for that long.  When I was first diagnosed, my doctor told me I could have gotten it from any of the partners I had prior to my current boyfriend because the virus can stay dormant (not active) for many years.  |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	absolutely.......it can lay dormant for years before any flare........
3cf217647180bfb2c379e2734edb5e5daa	Here is a start.  It's basically a lot of fruits and vegetables and low fat. You need to find out what kind of a sodium restriction he has and monitor it very closely.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11181101	low salt and low carb|`|RDzDhpEVaa	keep ur body fat low. controle the LDL (bad cholesterol) that u eat. try to get a little more HDL (good cholesterol) in ur diet like olive oil in ur salid.

41d9bbe883651498cfddaa868b122362aa	its more likely you only have pain in the one with the cavity, but it can jump from top to bottom and vice versa. take nurofen plus and paracetamol that should ease the pain until you see your dentist|`|46DyqVceaa	You need to be more specific, how long have you had the pain?  Is it really sensitive to heat or cold?  All you can do is take over the counter Advil (you can take up to 4) every 5-6 hours until you see your Dentist.|`|EpWyNMqMaa	Tell your parents if you live with them, if you haven't already. I haven't read your other similar question, so I'm not sure about your living situation. You may need to schedule a dentist appointment to have the dentist look at your tooth. That would be the best solution.|`|7lXXOJwIaa	Hold an anise seed agains't the tooth then make an app't with your dentist|`|eK9NTFUXaa	Try paracetamol .. it really works ..!!<br>  <br>  |`|Sl22icKOaa	Try a pain reliever. Call your parents. |`|rfbm62p6aa	try rinsing with salt water it takes down the swelling and cleans the gum. Another one I've heard of is swish vodka over it (don't swallow). Then there's the old standby of oragel or another numbing ointment. Good luck. Oh yeah and get to a dentist because it doesn't get better.|`|1lW5eYcQaa	Use oragel, and take ibuprofen. 
wQmtSRqXaa	It's called "tonic-clonic spasm" or "myoclonic jerk", and it happens to everyone... especially when their conscious controls are shutting down like as they're falling asleep, getting very bored or over-concentrating on a mental task.|`|xPGSmTyEaa	Yes. When you enter a certain stage of sleep, sometimes the brain recognizes this as a stage before dying, therefore it tries to twitch you "back to life". Perfectly normal.|`|6QmDm8iwaa	yea that happens to me too but i think its nothing out of the ordinary
