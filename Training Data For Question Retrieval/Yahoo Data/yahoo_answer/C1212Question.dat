Too much speculation to ever prove.      I say the following:   1952- Washington DC. Known as the "Washington merry-go-round". Twice in summer of '52, both Andrews Air Force base and Washington National airport suddenly spot nemerous "bogey's" on radar over DC, in the most highly restricted air spaces. Visual sightings also made and photographs were taken.      Both times, F-86 sabre's were scrambled to intercept, only to have "bogey's" dissapear as fighters came within 20 miles of targets.      The official explination for this incident was "temperature inversions" playing tricks with the radar.      This event caused the greatest "stir" within the government as to UFO's.  They had been doing some investigation under the name "project grudge", but after this event, it was renamed "project blue book".

20070709212428AAcldx6	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Raciocínio lógico - Se 1 queijo tem buracos, onde é buraco n?o há queijo.?	Se 1 queijo tem buracos, onde é buraco n?o há queijo.?   Assim qto + queijo + buracos e qto + buracos - queijo, ent?o Qto + queijo - queijo ?    Resposta do Sr. Alberto:   O buraco, pra existir, precisa de queijo em volta.   Logo, a assertiva "quanto mais buracos, menos queijo" é falsa!   A assertiva "quanto mais buracos, MAIS queijo" é verdadeira.      Ent?o ficamos com:   1) Quanto mais queijo, mais buracos   2) Quanto mais buracos, mais queijo   3) Logo, quanto mais queijo, mais queijo !      Assim, o que era um paradoxo falso, virou uma tautologia ...       Fonte(s):      Lógica mineira de queijos e buracos (rs!)    Resposta do Sr. Karalegal:   este raciocínio está errado.      1- Quanto + queijo + buraco é obvio    2- Quanto + buraco + queijo pois na afirma??o 1- o buraco é referente a quantidade proporcional ao queijo, se aumenta o queijo aumenta o número de buracos, e se aumentou o número de buracos aumentou o queijo.      O buraco da primeira afirma??o e o buraco da segunda afirma??o sua s?o diferentes.      portanto Quanto + queijo - queijo é absurdo.

20070317060004AAnYwMJ	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Is there any standard closure time of level crossing in railway technology?	At level crossing,road traffic has to wait to get pass the train.Its closure time i.e.closing of barrier and opening the barrier is really very frustrating for road traffic due to more than a century old practice of giving precedence to rail traffic over road traffic.      During last 2-3 decades,road technology has been far more improved as compared to railway technology(with exception of maglev trains).      Although TVU has been one of measure of traffic crossing at level crossing(without considering closure time with the exception of Japan which considers closure time also).      Still there seems to be no uniform opinion over the standard closure time of level crossing under normal conditions to pass one train.

20070407143141AAbJ5RL	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Diagonale di un quadrato... strano?	Ciao a tutti, come ci dice il buon Pitagora la diagonale di un triangolo rettangolo isoscele (metà di un quadrato) di lato l è uguale a l√2.    Ora poniamo il lato uguale a 1: la diagonale ovviamente risulta uguale a √2.    |   |    |   |_______   ......1........   Ma affrontiamo il problema da un'altra ottica: la somma dei due cateti è uguale a 2, anche se divido ciascuno di essi a metà (ognuno lungo 0,5), formando una specie di "scala".    |   |___   .......|    .......|___   ........0,5...      |_   ...|_   ......|_   .........|_   .......0,25.....   Ma se itero questo procedimento molte volte, diciamo un'infinità, questa "scala" coincide con la nostra diagonale, non più lunga √2, bensì 2.    Chi mi sa spiegare il perché?

En el momento que quitaramos la gravedad con el interruptor todos los cuerpos que ocupan la tierra, automaticamente comenzarian a flotar incluyendo toda el agua de los oceanos. (Esto seria por unos 30 segundos). Y supongamos que en el transcurso de esos 30 segundos todos los cuerpos que van subiendo llegan a una altura maxima de 20 metros, incluyendo como dije antes toda el agua de los Oceanos.   En el momento que se vuelve a conectar con el interruptor la gravedad de la tierra, enseguida todos los cuerpos caerian de nuevo.   La pregunta es la siguiente: ?Que consecuencias traeria esto para el planeta, considerando la cantidad de agua que caeria desde una altura de 20 metros?   ?habrian catastrofes de algun tipo?

I graduated 2 years ago from a top 20 law school and went to a good undergrad (BA in political science.)  I am 27 and have very little educational debt.  I have always enjoyed math and had an interest in the sciences, but never acted on it when I was younger.  I have been practicing at a firm for 1.5 years doing litigation but am looking for more professionally.  I am seriously considering going back full time for a B.S. in Electrical Engineering so I can practice before the PTO.  I was curious if going back for an engineering degree after law school is frowned upon by employers in patent practice? Any other comments or advice about my situation would be very helpful as well.

I have done a bit of research on cats and dogs and have designed a procedure that could create a crossbreed of a cat and a dog.  They are below.  Are any of them possible?   1)Fuse cat and dog skin cells together.  Inject the resulting skin cells into a dog egg cell which has had its own nucleus removed.  Implant in an artificial uterus(which i have also designed).  Remove when resulting embryo is old enough to leave the artificial uterus.   2)Fuse cat and dog blood cells together.  Inject new blood cells into a baby dog.  When dog is an adult observe behavior that differs from other dogs.  Extract DNA sample from dog, and inject DNA into a cat egg cell which has had it's nucleus removed.  Implant into artificial uterus, and remove when the resulting embryo can survive outside of the artificial uterus.   3)Extract brain cells from cat and dog.  Fuse together, then inject into a dog embryo.  When the dog embryo is an adult, take DNA sample and inject into a cat egg cell which has had its nucleus removed.  Implant resulting cell into artificial uterus, then remove when it no longer needs to be in the artificial uterus.   4)Take skin cells from cat and dog.  Fuse DNA together, then inject into cat egg cell which has had its nucleus removed.  Implant into an artificial uterus.  Remove when the fetus no longer needs to be in the artificial uterus.   P.S.- Sorry about the long question.  Any help is appreciated.

20090205151027AACDg4Q	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	I think my teacher is wrong about circuit diagrams. Am i right?	Ok so were learning about circuit diagrams/schematics for our unit in science on electricity. We had to write a lab report and include 5-6 circuit diagrams of circuits we had made. When it came to the D-cell "batteries" that we used for a power supply, i thought that they should be drawn as a single cell ( ---i|--- or for two connected ---i|i|----).   But, my teacher told me that D "batteries" are in fact "batteries". By definition, a battery has more than one cell. If there are more than one, where are the other cells? I have opened a 9V battery, and there are clearly 6 different cells. I even looked in our textbook and it says " D, C, AA, AAA "batteries" are more accurately called cells". I showed my teacher this and she said "yes look, see how "cells" is plural?"      I think that she is completely wrong, but i need to know how to prove it to her.
