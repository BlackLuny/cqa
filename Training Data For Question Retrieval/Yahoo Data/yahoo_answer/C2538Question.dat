20060907101256AACfSXW	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Mechanics and Gearheads: My question about the 351 Ci Modified Ford V8 was wrong, see here..?	1977 Ford Truck, Originaly was a 351 MODIFIED (Came from the factory like that), overhauled, bored out, longer pistion rods (if not, the stroke was made longer for more power, one of the two), racing heads and racing pistons, new crankshaft, better camshaft. It had dual exhausts, better spark plugs, high flow cat converters, and some kind of special sleeve or something in the combustion chamber area (dont know what they mean). It also had a good air filter, and a few other mods.      So, about how much Hp (and/or torque) are we talking about here?   It ran on Gasoline.
20060825204210AATiOg2	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How to go from Vrrrrrrrrooooommmm to Vrroomm Vrroomm?	What parts make a car's naturally aspirated gasoline engine rev quicker?    I remember when I had an '87 Mustang with the 5.0LV-8 engine and it rev'd (up and down) quickly when it tapped the gas peddle.  But I've had 4-cylinder cars that did not rev nearly as quick.  At first I thought it had to do with how much power the engine had, but I've had a '04 Maxima with 265 hp (65 more hp than the Mustang -side note:  the '87 was originally rated at  225 hp, but later calculations confirmed that it only had 200 hp) and although it accellerated as fast, the engine did not rev nearly as fast when you tapped on the gas.    So, if I had a stock engine that didn't rev that fast, what aftermarket high-performance parts would I need to get to make the engine rev faster?  A rocker cam?  Light weight lifters?  Light weight crankshaft?

20080927012322AAKmTw4	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Motorbike, Kitcar or baby, who wins?	Hi,      Im 33 and going to be a new dad any day now and I cannot wait. At the moment for fun and getting out and about I have a nearly new motorbike - GSXR 750, which I think is a great bike that I enjoy riding, although these days I get less and less time to ride it, bad weather or just too knackered after work or busy at weekends, so at the moment its only once to twice a month! However, I always made a promise to myself that once I became a dad I would sell the bike as I do think they are dangerous, and my parents and partner think so too and have always been against me having it, although they have never pressured my to sell it, but bikes are soooo much fun.       I have lost 1 friend when a car pulled out in front of him, and another friend had a bad crash when he hit gravel at 40 on a roundabout, and another friend hit a rock when his bike sprung an oil leak over his rear tire!! plus there is a lot of negative press about the safety of bikes.... anyway, now im in the position im not 100% sure that I want to sell it now.       So ive been thinking of other ways to get my fix, namely a road race bicycle, or a kit car, like a Caterham, or both?      Has anyone gone from a motorbike to a road race bicycle or kit car for fun, or do you own one now? Or should I just not get either and keep the bike, or have none of them and concentrate all my time on my family? But I guess I wont know for sure until baby arrives and see how its goes then???

They also said the camper was damp but we said again it does not leak but what do you expect from a vehicle this age!

20081122025536AAPaWyb	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Mg zr issues with overheating and HGF Failure please help?	I have an MG ZR 1.4 with 64,000 miles ont he clock. It broke down at 63,000 on the motorway with Head Gasket Failure, the coolant was completely empty when it broke down but I had only filled it a few days previous.    I got towed to the garage and they confirmed the head gasket was gone. Advising it would be around ￡860.00 to sort out. The garage called later in the week and advised that the head gasket had been done at least once if not twice before and that they needed to put a head saver on it as the head was that badly worn and they they would also have to replace the valves which were also in a bad state.      I have had the car back a month and I am still having lots of trouble with it and I am worried the head gasket si going to blow again, the followign things are happening:   1.)The coolant level drops extremely quickly I am currently topping up every two to three days.    2.)The engine makes a peculiar ticking noise   3.)It is very slow getting from 0mph to 20mph feels like I have to rev the engine to get going.   4.) there is NO mayo on the disptick or oil filler cap.   5.)White smoke comes from the exhaust not excessive but more on a cold day.      Please can somebody advise me on what is best to do, I had only had the car 6 months when the gasket went and its cost me a small fortune to sort out. I could ahve bought a new car for the money ive spent. gutted ;-(. Somebody did say I may be better off just getting whole engine replaced but with something otehr than the old rover engine thats in it?

20090205014321AARvplV	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	1985 oldsmobile 442 transmission?	the transmission on my dad's (partially mine) 1985 oldsmobile 442 starts to slip once it's warmed up and ran on the freeway for about 10 minutes... after driving it for awhile after sliding into a curb in the '91 corolla i drive and bending the rim/lower control arm/ broken ball joint, i been driving the 442... I have noticed the transmission doesn't shift into 4th until around 30mph, no matter if i am easy on the gas or not... also, driving it lightly has yield only about 14mpg on average... I also noticed sometimes it won't shift into Overdrive at 45mph like it should, which means i'm at a higher RPM, burning more gas...      could the transmission fluid/filter need to be changed?? i'm thinkin that's why it slips and shifts early when it's hot, and why it won't shift gears normally when it's being driving around town...

20060710152103AAkaQfM	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car is making a subtle hissing noise.  It is coming from the break, when I tap the break it stops. Ideas?	It doesn't happen all the time when I drive, but usually kicks in within 15 mins of operating my vehicle.  I drive a 2002 Ford Escape.  When I turn the radio off I can hear a hissing noise coming from underneath the dash.  It sounds like sssssss....  When I tap on the break it stops, so I assume it has to do with the breaking system.  No break lights have come on yet.  Should I take the car into Ford to find out what the problem is?
