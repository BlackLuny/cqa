20090307075738AADfSM2	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Should my tattoo be peeling?	Just got a new tat on the top of my foot a week ago. It's my 3rd tattoo, but it's the first really big one I've ever had, so I'm not sure if this is normal..      My tattoo is itching like crazy (but I haven't been scratching it). It is cracked in some places and the color and lines are fading. In two places the outer layer of skin is gone and you can see brighter ink below. My tattoo artist said that I would definitely need to come back to get a touch-up because of where my tat was located, but is what's happening to my tat normal? I've been taking care of it (ointment first couple of days then switch to lotion) like I've supposed to...so I don't know whats wrong.

20090307083416AA0wNIE	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	About my Future..........?	Hiii.   I wanna be a Fashion Model and Fashion Designer. Many people say thats impossible for me. And I have come to Yahoo! Answers to find out if that's true.   Let me kick off with exactly who I am.   So my name is Rai Crey and I am 13. Born a Virgo. My nationality is Indian but I don't look like one..Atleast proud to be one! And I live in Africa. I hope that's enough.      What I really want to do is : Have a Clothing Line - something like Ed Hardy or DKNY. (These two really inspire me) and be a Fashion Model. But my question here is can I model for my own Clothing Line? Then secondly, I wanna be famous from my 20's. And not from my 40's about my work. How do I do that? I know it's impossible. But I just want a way where I can show the world my Fashion and the way I see it. Basically I'd love to be famous. And if I'm not it's fine. If I am I'll be happy more happy than ever. So how do I do that?   And I hear, Fashion Models should be Photogenic. To myself, I don't think I am. How can I be photogenic? Do models need to smile more or have a straight face? Oh! I forgot. I have to tell you which type of modelling I'd really wanna do, right? OK. I wanna do the ones in Magazines. Pose for pix.      Sorry for numerous questions but I really need to know. I have no one else to give me an honest reply. My friends are good-for-nothing type.      And are there any Fashion shows I can attend in India for young girls of my age? - I mean in Calcutta. Beauty Pagents..anything? Please let me know!   How can I attract a Modelling scouts eye?   And it's alright if you have spots on your face, right? The make-up artists should know how to cover it up, right? I hope so.   And the LAST question!   Um...Are there any websites where I can post my drawings to? My Fashion Sketches?   I am really into this since I was younger, any of you can help me?      Thanks alot! =]   Have a Great one...      x

Firstly am I doing the right thing?      Secondly I do want to dye my hair just a tad lighter but I am not allowed. I was wondering if anyone knew any tricks on how to make your hair lighter without dye?      This is a pic of me without any make-up on and my natural hair and hair colour:    http://s662.photobucket.com/albums/uu342...       So    1) How can I gradually fade out the amount of  make-up i wear (btw atm i wear mainly mascara, bronzer and a bit of eyeliner on my waterline)?      2) Only non hair dye products that make my hair lighter?      3) Do i look pretty with out any make-up and is my natural hair colour ok or should I go lighter?      Best answer gets 10 points.x :)

And we don't want to shop in abrocrombie and fitch or holister (we are aiming for older/classy look..not a more expensive version of aeropostle, i know many would disagree with me, but we really don't want to pay 40 dollars for a tshirt with the word, abrocrombie or fitch on it...waste of money)

Right now i'm pale as crappp, I haven't been outdoor tanning in a year but usually i get a very nice tan, yet since i haven't been outdoor tanning, even during the summer (with work and cheerleading) i'm just pale pale pale. I've been researching a lot on tanning beds and yes i know the risks, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME NOT TO TAN, i am well aware what i am risking. I'm wondering what type of lotion would be best. i don't have the most moisturized skin but i do exfoliate and use lotions a lot. so maybe an accelerator or moisturizer? I'd like to just buy the $50 month membership, and then if i see it fade a lot i'll start going again. But in a month will i have that "sun kissed look"? Also, do you wear goggles or no goggles? if you do, what kind should i get so i don't have weird lines on my face? thank you!

I just went back a week after my cut - which was fine - but I needed a little texturizing. I am emphasizing "little", and I explained it to the stylist. But, needless to say, it's too short!    How can I make them take their time, they always do the texturizing super fast, and before you know it too much hair is off! I am so pissed off, I want to cry! Do hairdressers hate it when I customer comes back to fix something and they do this on purpose? So far I've always had better haircuts by men, I don't like the way women stylists do my hair, definitely will look for a male stylist next time.

Now it's starting to fade to an auburn colour and i want to dye my hair permanently brown. Should I wait until this dye fades away or use the permanent dye over this one? I don't want my hair to turn ginger, but im worried about putting dye on top of dye? I used a home dye kit for the semi-permanent colour and I am planning to use a home kit next time.

One last question, if I still need to use a concealor now and then, should that go on under the foundation, or on top?  Thanks!!!

I wear basically the same thing to school everyday. I think it's partially because I'm lazy and don't feel like dressing up and partially because I don't feel like I could ever wear half the stuff that's out there. I don't ever see myself wearing it even if it's cute on someone else.      My arms have moderate eczema, and I've always worn a sweater or hoodie. I've kind of let that control my style too.      I'm really picky with clothes too. I'm not a fan of Abercrombie or any of the expensive/poor quality stores, and I've branched away from Hot Topic now that they're selling eye-stabbing clothing colors. I'm done with the black phase. I LOVE shopping, but it seems like I never find what I like now.      Where do I begin? How can I gain more confidence? What are good stores to shop at for picky people? Ah! :/ Can anyone help me with where to begin?

I guess I was kind of rude to her roommate and 4 friends. They had a lot of fun at my expense. They grabbed me and forced a dress over my head, tied me up with a pair of panythose and a bathrobe sash and they gave me a makeover and painted my nails. They took a ton of pictures. They've offered to destroy the pictures if I go over this weekend and model some clothes and cooperate completely. I was told I'd have to come alone and be extremely agreeable. I really want to destroy those pictures before any of my friends see them. Should I go over this weekend and agree in exchange for the pics they took? I think they plan to take more pics, but at least they wouldn't be as embarrassing. Is this a trap?  One of them joked that they want to introduce me to a Manny and Bob this time.  I don't know anybody with those names and I don't think they do either. Are Manny and Bob beauty terms or names for something?  I'd like to know what I'm in for.

Im 17 and before a week ago i used proactive, it worked great, left my skin clear just a little oily , but i used mac oil control lotion to stop oil, Proactive got to expensive so i decided to look for an alternative. I decided to try out Neutrogena oil free acne wash and Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System.  Now the oil free acne wash worked great, left my skin smooth and neither oil nor dry, but after to tries with the Acne Therapy System, it made my skin irritated and red and eventually started to peel. Now that my skin is peeling and very irritated should i still wash my face with the other Neutrogena stuff or should i just go wash free for a couple of days, Its been about 2 days and i haven't washed my face yet, just used makeup remover wipes to take out very little concealer and blush. Any ideas as to what i should do to treat the pealing and dryness?   can i use makeup?   any good acne system that is inexpensive?

And an hair conditioner to have it soft and easy to brush my hair. But when I dry my hair after a shower it gets from those little wisps, which is really annoying me...Some friends of mine has such beautiful hair and also soft hair. I use the same as what they use, cause I think that my hair would be like that then. But it doesn't work.. does it have to do with my long hair? I have been thinking of cutting my hair but on the other side, I love long hair and it would be wasteful to cut that long hair. And if I'm going to cut my hair I'll cut it in layers, but I've read on internet that it would arise if you cut it in layers =[ Cause I want my hair in model. People say my hair is very beautiful but I don't think the same as they do... I wish my hair is like those Japanese hair. I know it's kinda stupid to talk about this but I thought it'd be better if I asked it online xD It'd be nice if you gave me some advice! thank you very much in advance!

20090307093853AAuVCOn	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to cut a mullet so it doesn't look like a bowl cut?	OK, so I LOVE the mullet, I think its an awesome hair style. I've been trying to grow out the perfect mullet and its looking great.      However my mom cuts my hair for me and if I want to go to the hair places I have to pay myself, which I cannot afford, plus most hair stylist seem to hate the mullet(Don't know why), so I don't trust them.      So here's my problem; My hair looks great except 1 thing: My bangs.   My mom sucks at cutting hair so she always just cuts in a strait line and it ends up looking like a bowl cut, which is a hair cut I personally don't like. Plus, it completely ruins my mullet!      So how can I ask my mom to cut my hair so it doesn't look like a bowl cut?  Or else how can I style it (using only gel as that's all I have), so it wont look like a bowl cut?

I have REALLY long bangs...like equal length as my hair length almost.(It's been a while since I got it cut). I've had the same hairstyle(the long bangs kind of parted to the left) and it really doesn't look that flattering. I've cut my hair short before(shoulder length) and made my bangs more side-swept and I don't really want to do that again. It doesn't work very well with my face I don't think. People tell me to get side swept bangs and i WOULD but my hair is so fine that the hair just REFUSES to completely stay on one side. When I get it cut there's always a little piece that just sticks straight up.       I was thinking about getting bangs but I don't know if it will look terrible with my fine hair and big forehead. PLUS my skin is very prone to breakouts. I really need some help here guys.

"Its not our time, not our place our love for each other was just misplaced a hole in my heart one last breath its time to move on time to take the next step. No looking back although it may be hard there is a reason for everything a way to move on. Hope and love faith and prayer my love for you will always be there. A different love than before. Peace and happiness pain no more. Look for new things find a new place, now it’s the time the time for no mistakes. You finally have it right the way its meant to be. You taught me so much how to love how to hate how to accept how to fight the pain. No regrets forget the shame, it wasn’t our time and it will never be, it took me so long but I finally see. If there was a way id do whatever it takes, but its not there something we no longer share. The pain I can finally bare. I love you I care for you you mean everything to me but this is the way the way it has to be."
