yE81qpcraa	Sociology is the least academically respectable so I would drop that one. Even if you did want to do social studies at University, you don't necessarily need an A-Level in it to get on the degree course. That being said, I'd say it's probably the easiest out of all the A-Levels listed, but Geography and Business definitely look better on your CV and UCAS form.|`|H7xl7fEiaa	I'd drop sociology- it's not as demanding as any of the others and unless you want to be a doctor or in the civil service then it has nothing to do with any of your other choices. French, business, geography and art go well :)    (Just my opinion)|`|2deb44f39b95334e4baf74580a26fbb8aa	Hi. I've just got into Uni, and unless your doing a language based course, you don't really need a language.    Therefore, i would drop language, because i don't think that there are that many jobs that you can get with a french GCSE is there?|`|TycEvdg0aa	Take the strong subjects without hesitation but art and design isn't going to be too useful but all the same it would be foolish to drop ur best subject.

I recommend (:    Art is really good, you don't have to be a pro or anything, as long as you take time at your work, you will see results :D    Geography, Hmm, i never picked it but i hear it is quite easy :D    French i loved french, but i had to drop it to get business studies :(    sociology- we couldn't pick this subject for GCSE but my friend that goes to another school said it was quite good.

Most people usually shop at American Eagle, Hollister, Pacsun, etc.   At my school, we never had lockers, we just carry our bookbags with us.

On Saturday my son was evaluated and the results were gone over, according to this diagnostician, neither myself or my son have dyslexia but have asperger's syndrome, this wasn't a total shock because we have both heard asperger's before.  I don't know that I am buying that I am not dyslexic, but anyway    Here is what he told us:  Dyslexia is a specific reading disability affecting an eyeproblem, decoding problem, encoding problem, and the person must have at least an average IQ.    Essentially he said I spell too well to be dyslexic.  He acknowledged that I read on a 3rd grade level, have multiple regressions, fixations, problems with eye teaming, binocular fixation, eye focusing problems, dysgraphia and pretty much anything else you'd associate with dyslexia.    Recommended for both of us was vision therapy, also I have Irlen filters with prisms in them, and get the book: The gift of dyslexia by Ron Davis.    To me its a symptom of a bigger picture that could include dyslexia, and that dyslexia is a complicated dx.  Possibly its dysgraphia, hows your handwriting?  Mine is nearly illegible.    Suggest to see an optometrist who does dx dyslexia and does vision therapy, read the book above suggested, consider getting screened by an Irlen diagnostician as well.    Dyslexia can be treated and improved greatly    I am gifted and I find that is why I was able to complete a higher education without too much difficulty, just in a different way    My son who has a lower IQ, 83, he struggles...|`|03rOCajTaa	sounds like it to me  congrats on making it that far!

He could say "I have something in this bag, ask me questions to find out what it is."

[Granted, they aren't as bad as Stanford or Yale.]|`|o5NNAxMWaa	The best way to answer that is to contact admission officers at Rutgers or Penn State!

It also looks really impressive when you finally apply that you were an active and enthusiastic participant getting the important facts early on.

NBnuL73Eaa	Friar Laurence can be a very interesting character - especially if you look at his role towards the end of the play.    Ultimately he is trying to be the good guy - he is a friend and confident to both Romeo and Juliet throughout the play and sees the possibility that their marriage will bring peace between the warring families.    Although he is tries to protect Juliet by coming up with the plan to avoid marriage to Paris and then to abscond to Mantua with Romeo it his actions that (unintentionally) lead to the death of both characters.    So, what about doing your monologue from the point of Friar Laurence just after R&J have committed suicide - that way you blame yourself, talk about you guilt, but that your actions were based on good intentions (to bring about lasting peace between the Montagues and Capulets)... that you had warned the lovers not to be hasty...    I'd play in with much sadness and sorrow (he has lost two close friends or at least acquaintances) and that you want forgiveness.|`|6AS8xmnyaa	I think that's a really good character. Just be sure to speak clearly and loudly. If it's possible try getting the old version of Romeo and Juliet and watch it pay attention to how Friar Lawrence acts and speaks. Good luck!

xxtvhn5Naa	HaHa<br>  <br>  I've noticed that nobody is answering this question.  It's just because nobody knows what the answer is.  I think it means that there is someone who wants "authorized" financial aid.  I looked up Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG) and it says that it is: "The Ohio College Opportunity Grant Program (OCOG) provides need-based tuition assistance to Ohio students from low to moderate-income families. This program is a result of the merging of the Part-Time Instructional Grant and the Ohio Instructional Grant, with the intent to increase access to higher education. By raising the current household income ceiling of $39,000 in the OIG program to $75,000 in the OCOG program, more families will receive aid for their efforts to gain higher education."  So it looks to me like on Feb. 22, 2009,  the Ohio College gave $263.25 to someone as a financial aid to go to their college.  And it was authorized.  <br>  <br>  Thats just a guess, but it sounds right.  Its better than Igors answer.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	ooh bummer. that sucks. but sorry i have no clue what AFAB means haha

tqoB4exxaa	The nice thing about the brain is that it doesn't matter how fast you practice something on the guitar, your brain will learn from it. This goes back to DesCartes. Your mind is ready but your body is not. I'm thinking that this question is partly curiosity and partly frustration that you can't learn the guitar faster. I traded my aspirations to be a psychologist for being a Music Theorist. So I guess your in luck that I saw your question.<br>  It takes time because its not a simple memory that is to be recalled. It is an action that you must do, and that takes trial and error for your brain to comprehend what is right and wrong.  When you first got into a car (assuming you are of driving age) you were probably like "well that's the gas pedal, and that's the brakes, and this is the shifter and this is the steering wheel and that's the road. And I've seen my mom do this a million times, this should be a piece of cake" But to your dismay the gas pedal reacted completely differently than you expected, because you expected it to take far more pressure to accelerate than what was needed and you made your tires squeel. And the same probably happened with the brakes, where you thought they needed more pressure and they didn't. So in a nutshell, you can understand a concept, but it takes experience to get used to how to operate something.<br>  As far as guitar goes, keep practicing the very beginner stuff.

PfE6bg5iaa	you were close, it's FAFSA. And the women you talked to are correct, I have many friends that either finished or are currently in nursing school -- it's a very hectic schedule.<br>  <br>  Qualifying for the Pell Grant has nothing to do with qualifying for private loans.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can get a student loan to cover living expenses as long as your credit is acceptable or you have a credit worthy cosigner. However, you have to be careful here because often banks won't approve you for more than the cost of attendance (which usually includes a stipend for living expenses, but not $14,000). You should only apply for one years worth at a time, not the full $28000 at once! <br>  <br>  Also, you will have to shop around -- a lot of banks stopped offering student loans after the economic downturn. For reference, all my student loans were from Chase Bank and at an interest rate around 8% with my cosigners credit being around 690 and mine at 720 (altho I have little credit history). <br>  <br>  Have you looked for private scholarships? Try fastweb.com!<br>  <br>  It's good to hear that you're getting out and trying to start a career for yourself, I'm sorry that you lost a job... but maybe this could be a blessing in disguise? Nurses are probably the highest demanded profession right now, it will be nice to have employers seeking you out instead of the other way around!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|mlxkiujYaa	along with all the other, check to see if you qualify for any special programs through your unemployment office since things are so bad in your county they may have something|`|yGOmMQP7aa	It is perfectly legal to get grants, loans, scholarships, etc to help you pay for school and living expenses while you are attending.  This is why financial aid was invented!!!  You are lucky that you qualify for Pell, because you will also qualify for loans as well.  My advice is to contact the schools nursing department to get a list of your pre requisite classes before you go quitting your job entirely.  Most RN programs have a year or more of classes you have to complete before you can even make application to their program.  <br>  <br>  If you are poor and independent, you might get that much in federal grants, state grants, work study and loans.  The only way to know for sure is to talk to the school.<br>  <br>  Read this book cover to cover, it will answer most questions you have about financial aid.

If you have the heart for teaching, it will not burn you out. Sure, there will be times when things get tough, but everyone goes through those times. I'm sure that if you stick it through it'll pay off. The reward is definitely great.<br>  <br>  I am also trying to become a teacher. Through my teaching program I've learned to really connect with kids, and it's just so fun. Time flies by and I always feel energized when I teach and do teaching stuff. It's just so rewarding to know that I helped someone out. I'm sure you'll also be fine.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the burn out rate but it really shouldn't be happening.

I have since then learned to deal with it but it has it's moments. My best advice for you is to see a psychiatrist. They may actually be able to give you something for the anger. As far as basic life skills..almost always you will have an assistant with you. Just inform him/her of your situation and ask for help. Do not ever be afraid to ask for help. Yes you went to school and you will feel like they expect you to know but asking for help and accepting it will help you tremendously.

Franklin is still best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA. Her data, according to Francis Crick, were “the data we actually used”  to formulate Crick and Watson's 1953 hypothesis regarding the structure of DNA. However, when her work was published third, in the series of three DNA Nature articles, it appeared to only represent evidence in support of their hypothesis.[3] The possibility of Franklin having played a major role was not revealed until Watson wrote his personal account, The Double Helix, which subsequently inspired several people to investigate DNA history and Franklin’s contribution. The first, Robert Olby’s "The Path to the Double Helix," supplied information about original source materials for those that followed. After finishing her portion of the DNA work, Franklin led pioneering work on the tobacco mosaic and polio viruses. She died aged 37 of complications arising from ovarian cancer.|`|YKGKasMiaa	X-Ray diffraction - she helped in a way through her xray graphs discover the double helix of dna indirectly through watson and crick|`|q3kJ6x8raa	if im correct, she was the one who saw what the shape of DNA was like......it was shaped like an X

All the bright, interesting kids were admitted back then.  However, nowadays, colleges no longer have room for all the bright, interesting kids since about five times as many kids apply for the same number of slots, so luck plays a huge factor.  If you play tuba and the school's marching band's only tuba player is graduating in June, you might get admitted!  Or they might be looking for a baritone for the men's a capella group.  Or perhaps they need someone from Wyoming so they can boast they have a student from each of the 50 states.  Or you juggle and the admissions officer who's reading your application also is a juggler, so he gives you the thumbs-up.  If you get in, you aren't "better" than the kids who don't get in - you're just luckier.<br>  <br>  Ranto is correct - a good admission essay will give you better odds - but will not guarantee success - a lot of luck still come into it.<br>  <br>  What there is no luck in however is getting into a great school if you are a standout student (ie the type of student with a good chance at Stanford).

i5tOQGgFaa	Yes, a meal planning sheet will be a big help to you.  You need to find out what your budget is and what they want each snack/meal to consist of.  This is something you need to sit down with your boss with.  If this is a new task for you...you should NOT feel bad in asking your boss to help you plan the first month.<br>  <br>  I'd keep breakfast as pretty much the same thing week after week and the other meals rotate once a month.  Here are the meal components that I have to use (I work with a Food Program).<br>  Breakfast: grain, fruit/veg, milk<br>  AM Snack: 2 of the following- protein, grain, fruit/veg, milk<br>  Lunch: protein, grain, fruit, veg, milk<br>  PM Snack: 2 of the following- protein, grain, fruit/veg, milk<br>  Dinner:  (Are you at a center?!) same as lunch- protein, grain, fruit, veg, milk.<br>  <br>  *  You are probably going to have to do a little "research" on cost of items.  Check out bulk items/stores.<br>  *  Ask your boss for the past menus to get you started then branch off from them.<br>  *  remember that only 100%juice is considered a juice component.  Juice cocktails or punch are NOT.  Jello jigglers made completely with apple juice is considered a fruit serving!  <br>  *  It's easier, for breakfast, for you and nice for the kids to have a specific day.  For example, I have cold cereal day on Monday, English muffin/toast on Tuesday, cold or hot cereal on Wednesday, pancakes or waffles on Thursday, and Friday is our muffin day.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RD1uEbGWaa	Here are the USDA guidelines:  <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/care/ProgramBasics/Meals/Meal_Patterns.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/care/Program...</a><br>  <br>  If your boss would let you, my company has a sample menu and meal and snack planning sheet available for a small fee on our website:  <a href="http://www.kidcentric.com/products/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidcentric.com/products/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Misty|`|BtxQogSzaa	What you need is to get a plan sheet. if you plan all the meals, say a two week meal plan. so first monday they'll have toasted muffins for breakfast...apple for snack...etc...<br>  then tuesday something different, and the next week have something totally different, and then the third week will be back to week one...<br>  you could also put up a chart so that the parents know what their children are eating....if its healthy and well balanced it should go down well<br>  <br>  I hope that works for you :)

If you're allowed to use note cards or anything, use them.<br>  <br>  In high school I did a program called Youth and Government, and I had to speak in front of a lot of people all the time. Every time I was about to speak, my heart would race and I'd start sweating. But right before I spoke I'd write down my question so it wouldn't be floating around in my head and I was able to say it without stuttering too much. <br>  <br>  So try and use some type of notes to read from to organize your thoughts. Also, who cares if you're still nervous when you go up to do your speech? It takes a lot of practice to become a better speaker. It's a fact that most people would rather die than have to speak in public. So even if you bomb, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Just be cool.|`|H1zg5JDRaa	Hey, look...<br>  <br>  It's one minute... sixty seconds... If you screw up, what's going to happen??

Having to get up and read an oral AFTER a dozen people have stood up in front of the class and read directly off of their palm cards in a monotone...<br>  <br>  If you screw up and you're speaking with the same expression and the same tone it's more noticeable.<br>  <br>  Just be outgoing! Know your speech off by heart and give it some OOMPH! Walk around a little, change your tone, emphasize words. You may be speaking about the transition of a raw egg to a hard boiled egg, but speak as though you're explaining the party you went to on the weekend, or that photo you managed to snag of your older sister picking her nose and eating it. Even if the subject is boring, speak as though it is the most interesting thing you've ever heard!<br>  <br>  And lastly, DO NOT imagine them all naked.

If they grant you provisional acceptance a student usually has a quarter/semester sometimes even a whole year to show that they have what it takes to be there and show satisfactory grades.  If you get rejected ask for provisional acceptance or reapply or go to a JC and then transfer.  Some schools go based on test scores and essays but a big chunk is grades.

et9gdoDKaa	I was in the exact same position as you a year ago. I wanted to go to UT and thought I had a decent shot at getting in, but I didn't. (I was in the top 19% at my school, had a few extracurriculars (but not many), and my SAT scores were 610(reading) 620(math) and 670 (writing)).<br>  Tech was my second choice, too, and that's where I ended up (and now I'm tring to transfer to UT...just like your friend, I don't like Lubbock either). <br>  <br>  Anyway, I think you have a good chance of getting into UT, but with the 10% rule you can never really know :\   If UT is you dream school and you don't get in as a freshman, do the CAP program for a year and if you meet certain requirements you will automatically be admitted to UT. (i'm sure you know about CAP, but if not you can look it up on UT's website).<br>  I kinda wish I had done that instead of going to Tech because I could have had automatic admission as a transfer, but now I have no guarantee of getting in and I'm just as stressed as you probably are right now! And this is the second time I've had to deal with this...<br>  But here's the bottom line:<br>  If you think you could be happy at Tech then don't hesitate to come here becuase it is a great school! Lubbock just isn't quite as exciting as Austin...<br>  But as someone who has been in this situation before, I would go to a UT system school and then transfer after a year. <br>  Good luck - and I hope you get into UT on your first try! :D|`|hoEtmkTHaa	I think you'll be ok.

What matters is not what I think of him; it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man`s self-respect is a sin. Antoine de Saint-Exupery <br>  <br>  How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong...because sometime in your life you will have been all of these. George Washington Carver <br>  <br>  A man told his grandson: "A terrible fight is going on inside me -- a fight between two wolves. One is evil, and represents hate, anger, arrogance, intolerance, and superiority . The other is good, and represents joy, peace, love, tolerance, understanding, humility, kindness, empathy, generosity, and compassion. This same fight is going on inside you, inside every other person too." The grandson then asked: "Which wolf will win?" The old man replied simply:  "The one you feed."  Anon.<br>  <br>  You are the only person that can make my heart beat faster and slower at the same time.The Hot Chick<br>  <br>  Take love, multiply it by infinity and take it to the depths of forever.. and you still have only a glimpse of how I feel for you. Meet Joe Black<br>  <br>  "Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things you've left behind" - from Tribute Gran Torino - Clint Eastwood, Jamie Cullum, Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens <br>  <br>  “Work like you don't need the money, love like your heart has never been broken, and dance like no one is watching” Aurora Greenway<br>  <br>  War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children. Jimmy Carter<br>  <br>  The tragedy of modern war is that the young men die fighting each other--instead of their real enemies back home in the capitals. Edward Abbey<br>  <br>  Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else. Judy Garland<br>  <br>  A baby is God's opinion that the world should go on. Carl Sandburg<br>  <br>  The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat. - Lily Tomlin <br>  <br>  No act of kindness, no matter how small is ever wasted. Aesop<br>  <br>  "Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry." - Mark Twain<br>  <br>  Life is the only chance you get, how you live it, what you take from it, how much you give back, a joy and a heartbreak, doing the best with what you have, loving with all of your heart, treating all forms of it with respect, and a wondrous beautiful mystery-C.Yost<br>  <br>  Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak, Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen." Sir Winston Churchill<br>  <br>  I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones. Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)<br>  <br>  Whatever does not destroy me makes me stronger.  Friedrich Nietzche <br>  <br>  When I die, I want to go peaceful in my sleep like my grandfather did...not kicking and screaming like the passengers in his car. Unknown<br>  <br>  "I sometimes go to my own little world, but that's okay, they know me there."  Joel Hodgson<br>  <br>  "Some people say that I must be a horrible person, but that's not true. I have the heart of a young boy, and I keep it in a jar on my desk." Stephen King<br>  <br>  How many people here have telekinetic powers? Raise my hand. Emo Philips <br>  <br>  If you want loyalty - get a dog. If you want loyalty and attention - get a smart dog.” Grant Fairley <br>  <br>  You would think with all the genius and the brilliance of these times, we might find a higher purpose and a better use of mind. - Jackson Browne, Say It Isn't True<br>  <br>  I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it. Jack Handey<br>  <br>  If life was fair, Elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead. Johnny Carson <br>  <br>  Character is doing the right thing when nobody's looking. There are too many people who think that the only thing that's right is to get by, and the only thing that's wrong is to get caught. J.C. Watts<br>  <br>  You can stand tall without standing on someone. You can be a victor without having victims. Harriet Woods<br>  <br>  Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Eleanor Roosevelt<br>  <br>  No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Eleanor Roosevelt<br>  <br>  "We must protect the forests for our children, grandchildren and children yet to be born. We must protect the forests for those who can't speak for themselves such as the birds, animals, fish and trees."  Qwatsinas<br>  <br>  When all the trees have been cut down, when all the animals have been hunted, when all the waters are polluted, when all the air is unsafe to breathe, only then will you discover you cannot eat money.

Still go to the doctor. Talk to your dad.  It just might be the fact that you're dreading school. If you talk to the doctor, he/she might help. I can't see you/or talk to you. I don't know what you're going through with my own eyes. However, I know that you're definitely at the last strike, so it's important to take the right steps.

First he says they do not know much about him, except that he was supposedly smart enough to write these almanacs, however, this selfsame intelligence is put into question when Jefferson mentions that it is suspected that Banneker could never have written these on his own, and had to use his neighbor, who gladly assists the conceited Banneker in all that he does. Jefferson mentions that in his correspondence with Banneker, it seems that his intelligence is not all that great, after all. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

Try not to be judgmental: I know that they might not be as sociable as your friends from your old school, but every person has their own unique qualities, and something to share with a friend.<br>  <br>  What activities do you enjoy? Are there some activities in school that you can participate in so you can meet friends with similar interests? If not, why don't you look into starting your own club/activity?

The googol was invented by the American mathematician Edward Kasner (1878-1955) in 1938. According to the story, Kasner asked his nephew Milton Sirotta, who was then 8 years old, what name he would give to a really large number, and "googol" was Milton's response. Kasner also defined the googolplex, equal to 10^googol, that is, 1 followed by a googol of zeroes.

8kMZwgOuaa	hmm. i know what you mean. really theres nothing you can do school is school. but really thinking about how bad it really is makes it even worse. make the best of what you got. i mean eventually your friends will stop fighting,and maybe you'll get to change seats, everything will get better i promise. [:|`|QoOx93PPaa	This will probably sound like I'm being a jerk, but I promise I don't intend to. I think you should give yourself a reality check.<br>  <br>  - You need school. Without a good education your chances for getting a good job = minimal to none. Without a good job, you're going to be losing a lot of the finer qualities of life; nobody's going to take care of you but you.<br>  <br>  - There are hundreds, thousands of people who honestly don't get the opportunity to go to school. There are people who wish that they COULD go to school. Meanwhile you're lucky enough to live in a country where it's very possible for you to get a good education for FREE. You're so lucky, don't take that for granted.<br>  <br>  - I'm assuming you're a boy, by your name; so.. uh.. what girl is going to want an uneducated man? Really? Because if you're uneducated you won't have a bunch of money, therefore say bye to that hot sports car. <br>  <br>  - Chances are, the people you're frirends with now might not even be your friends when you're an adult. Trust me, education is more important than that. Find new friends who don't start drama.<br>  <br>  - So, there's an annoying kid beside you in class. Many of us have put up with a whole lot worse. Suck it up. I'm sure he finds YOU annoying.<br>  <br>  If you're competitive, you could do well in school by trying to get the best grades out of your entire class. That's what always got me through.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	Find new friends.<br>  Stop complaining.  Go visit a homeless person in the winter and live with them for a week, and you'll be glad to be in school.  Or you could visit an actual prison and then you'd really be happy to be in school.<br>  Good Luck!|`|75af7936914f071f0bf372ce806188c9aa	live with it-most people can|`|lxLeeYA5aa	Suck it up. Just wait til college..|`|AA12042427	everyone hates school, one way or another. believe it or not, not one person in the universe has loved school all 12+ years. We've all dreaded it. In fact I'm dreading the fact that in a couple hours I've got to  go to school. <br>  <br>  Go talk to your counselor, tell him/her how you feel like you're in prison. Chances are,he/she's going to understand what you're going through and try to help you, especially with the friend's fighing. For the annoying guy sitting next to you? Either suck it up because we all deal with it one time or another, or go talk to the teacher. Tell him/her that the person next to you is annoying you and ask to switch seats. Let him/her know that you cannot concentrate.<br>  <br>  For a moment I thought you might have hated school for more difficult reasons. If that was the reason I would have suggested you go talk to your parents or move to Mexico. It is to my understanding that there you can have a choice to continue school or not. Of course, that means you gotta pick up some spanish.<br>  <br>  Long term wise? Go join some sort of club. You can make some new friends and have a chance to breathe.|`|UvEfvVY3aa	I believe that all children dislike school at one time or another for one reason or another... the school work is too hard, too much homework, don't like the teacher, don't like the other students. You're not alone in those feelings. As for your friends fighting, you have a couple of options: Either find new friends, or talk to your friends and find out if you can help them find a way to solve their problems so that there will be no more fighting. Bottom line is: you can't control others' behaviors, you can only control your own. Right? As for the boy next to you who is annoying, 2 options: Tell the boy to leave you alone or you will tell the teacher, or, have the teacher move you to a different seat. Making school more interesting? Well, first of all, you have to have a positive attitude. You can have the BEST school in the world, but if you have a horrible attitude, school will be horrible for you. You have to make it interesting for you! Does your school have educational clubs to join? What do you enjoy? Chess? Badminton? Swimming? Debate? Or maybe a study group for your favorite subject? I think most schools will have these types of clubs. If not, why not start your own? Get some ideas into your mind and approach the teacher to help you with your ideas! ^.^ The main thing is: You have to look at the BIG PICTURE: School and a good education will help you get a good job in the future and have income so that you can support your family later on. If I could go back into school, I'd do ALOT of things differently. There were MANY times that I disliked school and the other kids, but if I could go back now, I'd find a way over those obstacles and do my best because I understand and know the meaning of a good education. Just remember: You can't control the behavior of others, and... if you don't like your situation, do your best to change it in a positive way! Hope this helps! God bless!|`|0oBaC5s9aa	Hello.<br>  I know this is not going to seem helpful, but we ALL had to go through school. Believe me kid, it is worth it in the end. You will be a lot smarter.

For one, it could be the same line, just a different equation.<br>  <br>  But it's most likely that your window size isn't big enough to display it all.<br>  <br>  To fix this, press the [Window] button, which will allow you to change the window settings. Make Xmin and Ymin smaller, and make the Xmax and Ymax larger. If the window is large enough, it will be able to display both without error (though don't make it TOO big, else the lines might be too small to see).<br>  <br>  If this still does not display the second equation, hit [2nd][Graph]. This will display your values in a table, from which then you can determine the size of your Y2 equation. Just look at X=0, and the corresponding Y1= and Y2= values.

n7bok7NRaa	Think of your thesis as your opinion on something. <br>  <br>  So if you think that acting would be a good career choice for you, you would say, "Acting is the best career choice for me."<br>  <br>  If it helps, put "I think that" down on the paper first, and after you come up with your idea, erase the "I think that" part. You don't need it.<br>  <br>  Now this is the most important part: DO NOT put words like "maybe" or "sort of" or "might" in a thesis. Saying "Acting might be a good career for me" is a WEAK statement. <br>  <br>  And throughout your essay avoid "maybe" and "sort of" as well. And be sure to never contradict your main idea. Saying "Acting is the best career for me, but some people say I'm wrong" also makes you sound weak. Push forward your opinion, and ignore anything that comes up that makes it sound like you "might" be wrong.<br>  <br>  I know, and you know, that you might possibly be wrong, but you shouldn't EVER bring that up in an essay. You're only there to prove a single opinion in the strongest way possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  To other essayists: Don't get me wrong, I understand the Classical format, but I highly doubt that's what she's supposed to write.

If you were really to get sick and have a doctor write you an excuse, then she might believe you were sick, but you would be feeling lousy and there would be no guarantee that you would get that much attention from her.  A good teacher has to spread her attention out to everyone in the class, not be "best friends" with one or two students.  It sounds like she spent time with you at one point; now she has to spend time with others (and she may have been told by her supervisors that she was paying too much attention to you and had to back off).|`|aKjGEYExaa	Fake vomit will do the trick.

If you have real injuries, the doctor would probably report it to the school, who would then look into the matter further.  "First degree assault" would suggest that she intentionally planned to injure you, and it does not sound like that was the case.

cWuumdy7aa	The official name of the Oscar statuette is the Academy Award of Merit. Made of gold-plated britannium on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.85 kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusader's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.<br>  MGM's art director Cedric Gibbons, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on scroll. In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife Dolores del Río to Mexican actor Emilio "El Indio" Fernández. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose naked to create what today is known as the "Oscar". Then sculptor George Stanley sculpted Gibbons's design in clay, and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent tin and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes for Golnaz Rahimi. Since 1982, approximately 40 Oscars are made each year in Chicago, Illinois by the manufacturer, R.S.

In support of the American effort in World War II, the statues were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.<br>  Naming<br>  The root of the name Oscar is contested. One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a TIME Magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.] Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that of the Academy's Executive Secretary, Margaret Herrick, who first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her Uncle Oscar. Columnist Qiang Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'" .

PfE6bg5iaa	Federal aid money and private scholarships for the quarter/semester will first be deposited in your university account and applied to your tuition and fees. Then, if there's anything left over the university will write you a check or directly deposit it into your personal checking account. It can take a couple of weeks between the time the school gets the money and the time they give you the left-over cash. They do it by term, not for the whole year. <br>  <br>  Private student loan money will depend on the bank you received the loan from. Some send all of it in a check addressed to you (ie Chase Bank) and other send it seperately each semester/quarter directly to the school. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps:-)<br>  <br>  EDIT: left over cash is often used to pay for living/personal expenses like food, clothing, toiletries. You financial eligibility according to the school usually includes estimates for these items. I think the second answerer thought I was saying that you were pocketing extra money and using it for Spring Break or something!

Any grants and loans you did qualify for would be dispersed quarterly.  At 18k a year, you surely have loans.  If you applied and qualified for extra money those are paid out quarterly.  Every school has a different method and time line for those pay outs.  Check with your accounting department.<br>  <br>  Just remember, any extra money that you do pocket is going to be expensive in the long run.  You'd be better off turning it back to the lender and have a lower balance to pay off at the end of school.|`|nisQ8euoaa	colleges.mywebcommunity.org - try this site.

RMPJOS6jaa	Undergraduate degrees from any university do not have any prestige.  Today, an undergraduate degree is needed for most entry level jobs in most industries, same as a high school degree was required 30-40 years ago.  Graduate degrees do start carrying weight, as there are specific programs at numerous universities that are well known to be more complex, difficult or rigorous, such as a MBA from Wharton or Harvard versus a MBA from UCONN.<br>  <br>  But the people who spent $40,000/year on tuition to attend a prestigious school need to believe their money bought more than the $12,000/year at a state university.|`|MW9yUcV5aa	Well going somewhere very prestigious, like Harvard or Yale, and doing well, would not hurt your chances. This is because those prestigious universities are probably more well known to the administration and that schools high academic standards would be more well known. However, as long as you get good grades in your university, no matter what university it is, the medical school would accept you as long as you meet their academic expectations. .|`|MRvwEnB0aa	No. They don't!|`|EfwF4N0raa	naturally med schools do care.  This is valid because more prestigious schools have more challenging programs or more effective ways of teaching.  A 4.0 would have different weight from different schools.

When children are taught what they need when they need it, the learning is so much more solid and meaningful.  When they are forced to learn what the group is learning, it can be boring and redundant and they lose interest.|`|zeTGmB3faa	I am older and have several grandchildren in school from elementary to high school. <br>  I am shocked to learn what is not taught anymore,and the that lack of commitment by the teachers  and administrators. The unacceptable part is that teachers now swear at students, show no interest in their performance or progress and make little if no effort to assist a student. It appears that many feel that it is just a job but with no commitment.<br>  Testing is now more important than actual learning. If one just studies answers for a test and was not required to actually learn a subject, students are more prone to failure. This is the fault of the States superintendent who is the person to set the guidelines. California is now in 48th or 49th in the Nation for failure. This is certainly a shame as we once had high standings.

The problem is the system.  It's impossible to engage students when it's "more important" to teach to national tests so that students are never, ever left behind.  <br>  <br>  Teaching needs to be engaging and learner-based, not state standard and test-based.

A lot of the other teachers didn't even attempt teaching us very well. That would also be taken care of.<br>  <br>  I'd change a lot of things, actually.

EI4fmPnoaa	"Doctor" means the person has attained a doctoral-level degree (Ph.D., D.A., D.F.A., etc.) but "professor" means a person has attained a particular academic rank within an institution.<br>  <br>  A person can hold a Ph.D., but only be an instructor. Instructor is a lower rank than professor. Often, recent Ph.D. graduates who remain on at the school where they graduated are given instructor slots until they can find a job as a professor somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Above the rank of instructor, there are usually three ranks of professor. "Assistant professor" is a person who has not yet attained tenure. They're sort of employed on a trial basis, and can be dismissed more easily than tenured personnel.<br>  <br>  "Associate professor" is the first tenured rank. These are normally people who have obtained tenure, and are thus a more-or-less permanent part of the faculty, and have usually published at least one book or other major research contribution in their field.<br>  <br>  "Professor" (sometimes called "full professor") is the highest rank, and is usually a person who has at least two books or major research contributions in their field.<br>  <br>  The head of an academic department is usually called a "chair," but many schools also have non-administrative chair positions. These "endowed chair" or "research chair" positions are a step above full professor, in some ways. They provide significant additional funding for outstanding researchers or educators.<br>  <br>  It doesn't happen often, but it is possible that someone without a doctoral degree can become a professor. And it usually only happens for a Ph.D. (or other doctoral degree holder) who is very new in their field, but it's possible for a person with a doctorate to not also be a professor.|`|S9vnARx8aa	A doctor has been to school longer and has a higher degree than a professor. Most college proffessors have a masters degree (usually 4yrs college +4yrs grad school) a Doctor has a phd ( a college degree, +a masters degree +aphd) so they've worked longer for the title and feel that they've earned the right to be called Dr. and not just Mr or Proffessor.

AA11649195	The answer to that is because Lennie doesn't control his force. In Weed, he was petting a girl's dress, and when the girl panicked, it caused Lennie to panic and accidentally used force. Again, Curley teases Lennie, and receives Lennie's force. Since you read that George had to order Lennie to let go, it's similar because he unknowingly used too much force. This will reoccur again near the end, and you will see it :) Don't want to ruin the book for you!
6DFhlt4daa	1382, "philosopher of the school founded by Zeno," from L. stoicus, from Gk. stoikos "pertaining to a member of or the teachings of the school founded by Zeno (c.334-c.262 B.C.E.), characterized by austere ethical doctrines," lit. "pertaining to a portico," from stoa "porch," specifically Stoa Poikile "the Painted Porch," the great hall in Athens (decorated with frescoes depicting the Battle of Marathon) where Zeno taught (see stoa). Meaning "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" first recorded 1579. The adj. is recorded from 1596 in the "repressing feelings" sense, 1607 in the philosophical sense; earlier stoical (1432 of philosophers, 1571 as "indifferent to pleasure or pain").<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stoic" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term...</a><br>  <br>  One who is seemingly indifferent to or unaffected by joy, grief, pleasure, or pain.<br>  Stoic A member of an originally Greek school of philosophy, founded by Zeno about 308 B.C., believing that God determined everything for the best and that virtue is sufficient for happiness. Its later Roman form advocated the calm acceptance of all occurrences as the unavoidable result of divine will or of the natural order.<br>  adj. also sto·i·cal (-?-k?l)<br>  Seemingly indifferent to or unaffected by pleasure or pain; impassive: “stoic resignation in the face of hunger” (John F. Kennedy).<br>  Stoic Of or relating to the Stoics or their philosophy.<br>  [Middle English Stoic, a Stoic, from Latin Stōicus, from Greek Stōikos, from stoā (poikilē), (Painted) Porch, where Zeno taught.]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/stoic" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/stoic</a><br>  <br>  STOICISM: a school of PHILOSOPHY founded in the fourth century B.C. by Zeno of Citium which taught a PANTHEISTIC MONISM that identified GOD with the principle of UNIVERSAL REASON and advised everyone to accept their place in the scheme of life by doing their duty which was to follow the most RATIONAL path possible. The STOIC virtues were knowledge, reason, courage, justice, and self-discipline attained through the study of philosophy which leads to a virtuous life. Stoics taught the EXISTENCE of NATURAL law which is known to all people and the common humanity of mankind. Today the best known stoic is Marcus Aurelius whose works have been popularized by such POSITIVE THINKERS as Dale Carnegie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/books/concise/WORDS-S.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/boo...</a><br>  <br>  Stoic philosophy was developed in Athens in the third century bc, and reached the peak of its popularity among the upper classes of Rome during the first century bc and the first century ad. The Stoic view of knowledge is empirical; knowledge comes to us from the world through ‘appearances’, which are impressed on our minds. Reason, seen as the quintessentially human characteristic, enables us to understand the world; it is possible to form a community of those who use reason, which will be superior to any secular community. While in pursuit of this ideal, Stoics did not always withdraw from participation in political life; the Roman Stoic Seneca served in the Roman senate and influenced the emperor Nero, although in later life he moved away from Rome to concentrate on writing.<br>  <br>  Stoicism denied the importance of all bodily conditions, and emotions were always regarded as bad. The only factor seen as essential to human happiness was virtue, all else in life having significance only as an opportunity to demonstrate that one possesses virtue. Seneca claimed that one could demonstrate virtue equally well through pleasure or through pain, whether enjoying a banquet or submitting to torture. Since all bodily experience equally provided an opportunity to show virtue, no experience was to be deliberately sought out over another. This contrasted with other philosophical approaches; for example, Epicureanism, which regarded pleasure as the goal of life. For the Stoic, poverty and detachment from the world were not seen as essential for the achievement of the good life, nor need worldly wealth be abandoned in the quest for virtue.<br>  <br>  (more.........)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/STOICISM" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/STOICISM</a>

sjOelwhhaa	Auxiliary verbs are the "helpers" that give various shades of meaning to lexical verbs and impart tense.  Modal auxiliaries (modal=mood) are can, should, may, must, have to, might, will.   We use them with a regular (lexical) verb.  We can say "I can go," which means I am able to go, or "I should go," which means it is advisable for me to go.  The only difference is the change of modal auxiliary.  <br>  <br>  Auxiliaries that impart tense are "have" in the present perfect:  I have lived here  for 6 years.  Also "had," "be" "will."  I had never met him before.  I was living in Peru then.  We will have arrived by next Tuesday, etc.<br>  <br>  Lexical verbs are regular verbs, the verbs that are in the sentences above that are NOT auxiliaries:  go, live, meet, arrive.<br>  <br>  Finite verbs have a tense/time.  All the verbs above are conjugated for tense and grammatical person.  More finite verbs:  I enjoyed meeting you (enjoyed).  We left at six (left).  I live on Maple Dr. (live).<br>  <br>  Nonfinite verbs cannot be the verb in a sentence.  They can act as nouns, adjectives, etc.  Just think of gerunds, infinitives, and participles.  "Meeting" above is a gerund.  It isn't a verb but has a verbal meaning.  it doesn't have time/tense/number.  Another:  She wants to live here.  "To live" is an infinitive and acts as a noun.   "To live here" is what she wants.  The verb in the sentence is "wants."  "To live"   isn't inflected for tense/number.  <br>  <br>  One more:  I tripped walking down the steps.  Here the verb is "tripped."    We know "walking" has a verbal meaning, but it's not the verb of the sentence.  It's a participle.

That's why they allow time to add or drop classes in high school.  If it's not too late, and it's not for you, drop it and find something else.  Droping classes does not affect anything with college.  Keep up your grades and do well on your ACT's and you'll be fine.  It's not as bad as it seems getting into college|`|8jl1tMiPaa	It depends -- if you receive a failing grade, your GPA will drop -- and this could affect your ability to get in.  Overall, however, if you haven't made a habit of dropping classes, then dropping one class is not going to have a huge impact on your transcript.<br>  <br>  I'm in graduate school, already finished my bachelor's, and I can honestly say that you shouldn't stress too much about the little things. And a "permanent record" doesn't really exist -- there is no document that follows you around from school to school detailing every little mistake you made.

AA12042427	That really sucks, especially since its in the middle of junior year.<br>  Treat your mom and step dad with respect, despite what you're trying to accomplish. Because, frankly, that's just going to hurt you in the end. Your mom will feel as if she lost you, and I'm sure you care about her enough to want her to be at her best. Make it up to your step-mom and dad. Talk to them, show him that you've changed, and you've decided to accept your step mom. If he does not allow you to move back in, well, I guess you'll have to live in arizona. I understand how you feel. My dad is about to send me away to NY. I'm a So Cal girl, I' cant take the cold! Pretty much, its been intense these past 2 weeks because everyday just might be the last I get to spend with my friends.<br>  <br>  Here's my suggestion to you. Work out a plan with your parents. Ask your dad if you can go back senior year if you make it up with your step mom. That way, you can see your friends a year from now! But, being in a new environment can't be that bad. I'm a sophmore now. i know what people are going through when they move so my group of friends and I help with the new kids. I'm sure where you are now, there are kids just as friendly as those that you know. This is exactly what'll happen once you get to college. It can be sorta of a pre-college experience! Anyways, it WILL be a fresh slate. You can be whatever you want to be. <br>  <br>  Don't hurt your mom and your step-dad. Welcome them, love them, and cherish them. They care greatly about you, and no matter what you do, they will not give up on you. Acting nasty to them will only result in something that will hurt all of you. Dont do it, accept reality, and deal with it.|`|59166794a4eea9b1481a31a467c05f30aa	i kinda know how you feel.. i moved to a new town when i was in 7th grade... sure its not the middle of high school but for me it was pretty tough moving in the middle of middle school. I remember how horrible my first day was... no one really talked to me and i felt completely alone. However, after the next few days i introduced myself to some people and slowly started making friends. Its really hard but it will happen. I know it sucks that you had ur life all set before but these are problems you need to go through. I would say just to not dwell on it... put yourself out there and try to talk to people. Most kids in highschool already have their cliques and groups of friends but try to find people who seem like your old friends and talk with them during class or lunch and slowly you will start becoming friends... ask someone to hang out on the weekend or after school... just dont get depressed about your old life.. its hard but you will definitly be able to move on.. <br>  sorry for such a long answer!|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	okay...if u focus on all the bad things about how u have to start over...u have to make new friends...u cant see ur old friends anymore..its just gotta make this whole dilemma way worse...u need to change ur mind set and focus on what u CAN  do..u obviously cant go back so ur gonna have to deal with it...i suggest u take this opportunity and make new friends! become a new person! look on the bright side!..yeh ur gonna have to start over...but change can be good...u might even meet someone special here...people will definitely respect u more if they see u being more optimistic about the whole thing...what good is it gonna do being rude to ur mum and just sulking around...its not gonna take u back to washington...so just be happy...smile...and everything will fall into place.|`|XBJHCiO3aa	I moved around a lot in elementary school, but really, if you miss Washington so much, you should either suck it up and try and get along with your step mom like your dad wants, or just get used to living in Arizona with your mom. Not to sound rude or anything, but you sound like you're not even trying. What you should do is stop being rude to your mother, and actually make an attempt at settling down in a new place (making new friends, hanging out with them, finding things to do, places to go and whatnot).|`|wr9lPEtVaa	Ive been in a similiar scenario, You should ask yourself though, does your dad truely love you if he chose his new wife over his own child. Also you can always make new friends, you can stay in contact with your old friends & maybe meet up with them when your all older. Also who do you feel more loved by, your mother or father (not including friends at all) ?

wFBVuBOkaa	You do NOT need a master's in education to become a history professor. You also do not need to major in history.<br>  <br>  You do need to at least minor (build up some activities with the history honors society, Phi Alpha Theta), and then go on to get your master's in history. If you have stellar references, some research experience, and experience as a TA or lecturer, you might then be able to get a low-paying contract position teaching intro history surveys at a community or junior college. If you're very lucky you might get an adjunct position somewhere.<br>  <br>  If you'd like a tenure track or even full-time professor position at a four-year school, you will most likely need a PhD. During your doctorate studies, you will get more experience teaching and lecturing and building up your references and credits.<br>  <br>  Do keep in mind that history professorships are incredibly competitive; read up on both serious and humorous academic blogs that take honest looks at the profession. Any good graduate program will try to discourage you from being a professor or from imagining that you'll be able to make a living at it, as history professors with steady, non-adjunct employment are the minority of total PhD graduates. Keeping high school or middle school history education as a fallback is a good idea.|`|AA11732565	Take your cap lock off! Jeez!|`|AXiKJDV9aa	You don't need to major in it during undergrad.

The program pays for you to obtain a Masters, but you do have to make a commitment to teach for a number of years in the system.|`|AA10383345	You might want to check out Teach For America or Teach NY, which you volunteer teaching inner city children and they will pay for your masters degree.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you could try becoming an assistant teacher and seeing if the school would pay.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could take out loans, and finish a 2 year education degree, and your job might have some sort of loan repayment program.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

PfE6bg5iaa	EFC is Expected Family Contribution. That's the amount of money the federal government thinks you and your parents should be responsible for in paying for your college next year. They will subtract the EFC from your expected cost of attendance to calculate your aid eligibilty. So say your school will be $15,000/yr. You subtract $1003 and you get around $14,000. So the financial aid office at your school will try to find $14,000 in grants, scholarships, and student loans for you. They might even find more than that.<br>  <br>  So good vs bad is really a question of whether or not you or your parents have an extra $1000 to put towards your education next year.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

3L4citcnaa	For now, just calm down. You're only a freshman. If you're this stressed out now, you'll explode before you can graduate. <br>  <br>  Now that you have taken several calming breaths, let's talk academics. You do realize that most students applying to Yale will have many many many IB and or AP classes under their belts? Honors just doesn't cut it. You need those weighted classes, not only to pull up your GPA, but to also show these big Ivy League schools what you're capable of. <br>  <br>  Also, when I was going through this horrid process, all the guidance counselors at my school constantly drilled us when we asked, should we take the harder classes and get B's, or take the easy classes and take A's. Their answer was, Take the harder classes and get A's. That's really what you have to do. Of course, try not to set yourself up for failure. I had a friend who took 8 AP classes (combo of school and online) his senior year, and his brain spontaneously combusted by second semester. Don't try to kill yourself. Try to push yourself, but don't get in over your head. <br>  <br>  Next: extra curriculars. Don't turn into an octopus with one arm in every activity available. That's not what colleges want to see. They'd rather see you in a strong leadership position in one or two key activities than a member or simple participant in twenty. Start now, as a freshman in the groups and clubs that hold your interest, and by the time you apply, you'll have more clout to brag about. <br>  <br>  Finally, what to do to make your application stand out? If you have decent grades, SAT/ACT scores, and are involved in extracurricular activities, congratulations. You will be just like every other kid out there applying to Yale. But not to fear: colleges admissions offices have given you a godsend: The Essay. This is your one and only, 2-3 page, prompted and typed attempt to convey to the haggard and grumpy admissions officers who have read hundreds of applications like yours why YOU should be accepted. But don't tell them that you're good at English, that you're witty, that you're studious, etc. SHOW THEM. Grab their attention. These readers are going to be bleary-eyed minimum wage folk. Be creative. Be witty. Be original. And when they ask what you'd like to do most, or what you would do if you could do anything you want, DO NOT, for God's sake, say TRAVELING. <br>  <br>  This essay should be the cherry-topped whipped cream with sprinkles on top topping to your application. <br>  <br>  But don't worry. You've still got a couple of years before you get to that point. If, however, you're smart, and really interested in making your essay that best it can be, check out "On Writing the College Essay" by Harry Bauld. It will be the best source EVER when the time comes.

UOmhBNxKaa	What they're saying is you have to have worked in a licensed childcare facility for at least 6 months to be hired as a teacher, or any worker who is to supervise children by themselves.  Without this 6 months experience you can be a teacher's assistant for the first 6 months and then move up to teacher,  Being a nanny or only going to school won't qualify for the 6 months experience in a licensed facility.  They will know you have the hands on experience from being a nanny and the book learning from school.  The 6 months will give you the time to learn licensing regulations.<br>  <br>  I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear.  Just wanted to explain their thinking.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	head start try there|`|i5tOQGgFaa	This is their own policy...not an "across the board" regulation.  Interesting...if they won't hire you...how will you ever get 6 months working in a child care center.  Hmmm...maybe broaden your work area options.|`|8SmAx9veaa	I have heard of that rule and it does make sense it just takes some time to get use to it.  When I first started out I had to start in the after school room and for those of us who work in a center that has after schoolers we know how "wonderful" they are.  But after I got the experience needed they moved me to my own room.  Also men can do this job and do it wonderfully.  This is my love and I wouldn't change what I do, I started out as a history major for high school and then switched to Pre-K.|`|Gd6GQvfsaa	You can apply if their are looking for a substitute teacher.I work at a CDC as a substitute and pretty much on call when they need me. That would give you more experience. Plus your going to school right.Some jobs require a certain of units completed in order to get hired. Keep looking you'll find something.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Do you actually want answers from WOMEN, or will I do?<br>  <br>  The problem you describe is not unique to you, nor to a particular line of work. It's the same in retail sales, waiting, or piloting jets - everyone prefers to hire experience. (And in the current economy, employers can pick and choose.) I had the same issue when I was starting. Later I went from working in a center to nannying.<br>  <br>  Obviously, every single center can't have always hired only experienced people. So there are several possiblilities<br>  <br>  You've encountered a temporarily hopeless situation in which since employers can find people with degrees and experience, you just can't get hired until the economy improves... or<br>  <br>  You haven't found the right center yet. Keep looking... or<br>  <br>  You'll be OK when you're done with school as their "real" policy is six months experience OR the degree... or<br>  <br>  They're guessing from your name and/or how you sound on the phone that you're not of the "right" ethnic or cultural group that they want to hire so they're lying to you.<br>  <br>  I actually knew a nanny who got hired on-the-spot when she took her charge into preschool. She didn't even ask for a job! They needed someone to start right away, and asked her. That was several years ago and probably couldn't happen now due to tighter regulations, but it does suggest something in how to look. If centers that kids you nannied for later went to have had good experiences with those kids, that might affect how they look at things.<br>  <br>  You might also ask some of your instructors for advice, as well. They generally will know local directors and what they want to see.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't give up.|`|rvv4JUzZaa	I was a PreK teacher for 3 yrs and I have never heard of that rule. I mean, that would be impossible to hire entry level teachers. Only qualifications that I know of are that you have a Child care license or a certain number of college credit hours in child development and CPR/first aid certification.|`|SLwl2k1raa	I had a similar problem, I had the qualifications but no work experience. I then joined a childcare relief agency and after about 3 months of temping I found a permanent position. It was a great eye opener because you got to see how different centers are run  and you pick up lots of great ideas too!

ed0a3da8d8b75d3fec9e4d01fb72d076aa	The Bachelor of Laws (abbreviated LL.B., LLB or rarely Ll.B.) is an undergraduate, or bachelor, degree in law offered in most common law countries as the primary law degree and which originated in England.[1] It was established as a liberal arts degree,[2] which requires that the student undertake a certain amount of study of the classics, but has developed into a more specialized professional degree in recent years.[3] Nonetheless, the goals of most LL.B. programs are to provide a scholarly education, and therefore jurisdictions which offer the LL.B. require additional education or training before a graduate is authorized to practice law.[4] In Australia and Canada it is sometimes referred to as a post-graduate degree because in those countries a previous college degree is sometimes required for admission. The "LL." of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural legum (of lex, legis f., law), thus "LL.B." stands for Legum Baccalaureus in Latin. In the United States it was sometimes erroneously called "Bachelor of Legal Letters" to account for the double "L" (and therefore sometimes abbreviated as "L.L.B.").<br>  <br>  The United States is the only common law country which no longer offers the LL.B. While the LL.B. was conferred until the middle of the twentieth century at Yale, since the late nineteenth century, universities in the United States have awarded the professional doctorate J.D.,[5] which became the required degree for the practice of law in the U.S. in the 1970s.[6] Many law schools in Canada and Australia are in the process of implementing J.D. degrees, although they differ from that in the U.S. (see the J.D. article for more information).<br>  <br>  Historically, in Canada, Bachelor of Laws was the name of the first degree in common law, but is also the name of the first degree in Quebec civil law awarded by a number of Quebec universities. All Canadian common-law LL.B. programs are second-entry professional degrees, meaning that the majority of those admitted to an LL.B. programme are already holders of one or more degrees, or, at a minimum, have completed two years of study in a first-entry, undergraduate degree in another discipline.<br>  <br>  Bachelor of Laws is also the name of the first degree in Scots law and South African law (both being pluralistic legal systems that are based partly on common law and partly on civil law) awarded by a number of universities in Scotland and South Africa, respectively.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1.  llb  <br>   load lovin ***** a beezie who loves loads wheather it be pipe loads or pipeloads <br>  iam currently takin loads for pipe loads cause iam a llb <br>  <br>  2.

LLB  <br>   when you say someone is LLB it means he/she is acting to Look Like Busy. <br>  <br>  This is common in most office environment where everyone sitting in front of PC types away furiously at the keyboard, but actually they are surfing the internet or chatting with friends. <br>  i When the boss came into office, all of us LLB. <br>  <br>  ii.

For one, many times after I read the question, I'm thinking "it depends on.....". Very seldom does the question allow for different situations. Secondly, I'd say that there might be several 'right' answers and no one to ask. <br>  <br>  But an advantage is that you can take it at your own pace. <br>  Secondly, you can be creative with your answers. <br>  Do you have any kind of questionaire in mind? That might make a difference also.|`|GO46i2l9aa	Well two disadvantages would be 1) untrue answers of course. Because even though it is written, and possibly anonymous people are still going to say what they believe is "socially correct". Another would be 2) you have to wait for a response. Because if you were asking these questions face to face you would have your poll almost immediately, but in written questionnaires you have to wait.  <br>  <br>  Two advantages are 1) Being able to ask numerous questions in one sitting. A person is more likely to answer more if they can sit and think about it instead of being put on the spot. And 2) You have all of your answers in one place, and it is easier to put your research together.|`|pC5SWxC3aa	Pros<br>  *In some cases, surveys can be done with groups of people.<br>  *Information is obtained immediately <br>  <br>  Cons<br>  *Limited to responses from just those who are on site - possible bias.<br>  *Respondents must be able to read, see, and write.|`|CPfjwfvMaa	biases <br>  comfortability<br>  common sense<br>  accuracy
f789ccdd7b0a42bee675d55cc82effbeaa	Asbestos has been used for centuries.  The first known use was to make wicks for candles out of it or even to use the fibers to make rope.  It will not burn, so it became important for construction and insulation over time.  They say that if the world trade towers had used it around their structural beams, they would have stood 30 minutes longer.  Later asbestos was used for brake pads for cars.  It even showed up in cigarette filters.<br>  <br>  As for industry...it was mostly used for insulation and as a fire-retardant material.  Also it was found in floor tile and carpet.<br>  <br>  My father works for a company in charge of testing for asbestos and hiring people to take it down.

Alle ragazze di  "buona famiglia"  si insegnava l'arte di curare la futura famiglia; dovevano ricevere una completa educazione, e fino a pochi giorni dalle nozze subivano una specie di clausura durante la quale veniva loro impartita un'istruzione pari a quella degli uomini dello stesso ceto sociale.<br>  Le donne colte fondavano delle Accademie dove si discu-tevano argomenti di cultura. Numerose donne, soprattutto in Italia ma anche nel resto dell'Europa,  divennero famose in vari campi, a cominciare da quello letterario; ne elenchiamo alcune: Costanza Varano, Vittoria Colonna, Veronica Gambara,  Alessandra Strozzi, Gaspara Stampa, Isabella   Morra.<br>  Isabella Morra nacque nel 1521 nel castello di Favale da nobile e potente famiglia. Con suo padre e con suo fratello Scipione,  la fanciulla cominciò gli studi letterari. Ma era il tempo della rivalità in Italia fra Carlo V e Francesco I,  e il barone dovette andare in esilio a Parigi portando con sé Scipione.  Isabella, rimasta con la madre e con gli altri fratelli,  dei tangheri, nel castello isolato, consumò la sua adole-scenza ad aspettare invano dal padre un messaggio che la portasse in Francia e l'introducesse alla brillante corte del Re.<br>  Ha una speranza, tuttavia.  Nel non lontano castello di Bollita (oggi Nova Siri), viveva un gentiluomo spagnolo, Don Diego Sandoval de Castro,  governatore di Cosenza, anche lui poeta.  Ma un giorno che Don Diego le aveva inviato attraverso il precettore dei Morra un'epistola o altre poesie, i fratelli di Isabella intercettarono la lettera, uccisero il messaggero, pugnalarono la sorella e tesero al gentiluomo un'imboscata mortale.<br>  Nel dramma di questa poetessa, assassinata a venticinque anni, sussiste il dramma dell'intero Sud.<br>  <br>  Le donne nell'università di bologna <br>  La leggenda parla di una donna che insegnò a Bologna tra il XII e il XIII secolo, Bettisia Gozzadini. La tradizione vuole che non solo tenesse le sue lezioni nello Studium ma anche nelle pubbliche piazze di fronte a grandi folle. L'Università di Bologna ammise le donne all'insegnamento sin dal XII secolo.

3f9e4ad8ff832a0183b81cb572ca0b46aa	I majored in journalism as an undergraduate, then worked for many years in advertising and journalism. <br>  <br>  Straight out of school, expect to work in a low paying entry level job. You may envision yourself working in an exciting and glamorous place, but in reality you will work hard, sometimes in pretty grungy conditions, and often have long hours, depending on which path you take. You may have to take your first job in a different part of the country just to get some experience. If you are motivated, have decent writing, people relations,  and organizational skills, and show a willingness to work hard and learn on the job, however, you can move up fairly quickly. You can increase your chances of getting a better job right out of school by focusing on taking courses that will help you develop very specific hands-on skills, and by doing as many internships (usually for free) as you can possibly squeeze in. It helps to have a good sense of humor, and a strong sense of self-confidence, because communications-related fields are typically not warm and fuzzy places. <br>  <br>  Working in a communications field, however, can be very satisfying and fun.  But no one should plan on starting off in a high paying glamour job, nor becomming wealthy from careers in communications. There are exceptions, of course, but for most people, this is how it will be. I don't regret majoring in journalism, and have enjoyed a lot of what I have done in my career, but there are easier ways to make a living. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1512f36a6f12955c2434dd24feec92ceaa	That is the major people choose if they dont know what they want to do with their lives.

Rjee89o2aa	Sounds like an exam question.. Wow... well, I usually trust my instincts and yes, they have led me astray sometimes but I can't help that I am so gullible. I can't tell you a specific time that I used that "criteria"  but i only make friends with people who appear nice and my instincts tell me are trustworthy, reliable etc. Does that answer your question?

XKl4EO2kaa	Your question is a little vague.  Which character traits?  There are so many.  What type of conflict?  Sports, family, chess, law-making, playground interaction, war...    <br>  <br>  For more information you might look up MBTI (Meyers Briggs Temperament Indicators).  This will give you much information about how people interact. <br>  <br>  Let's pick the conflict of who is going to wash the dishes.  A lazy person would never do them unless pushed.  A lazy person would also use paper plates and plastic spoons to avoid the conflict altogether. A diligent person might do them unless he thought it was someone else's responsibility.  A leadership type would dived the job into its parts and delegate.   Someone who was submissive would obey a parents rule and do them whereas a rebellious child would question authority or some other behavior ending in clean or unclean dishes.   Someone who has self-control might schedule the dish washing and do it when it come up on his list.    <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

dP2Zo9uVaa	Okay, I've been wanting to be a hygienist since I was a junior in high school. I've just graduated high school but i've done a lot of research. I dont know the specific answers to your questions but I can tell you this-the salary really is no different if you obtain your BS or AS in dental hygiene..unless you will ultimately want to teach dental hygiene one day--then you will want that bachelors. Secondly, the pay depends where you live. In California, you can bank in $300-$350 a day.My aunt is a dentist so its not just word of mouf.Research it..and really consider that the pay is the same with a bachelors or an associates. Sorry I couldnt answer any other questions but I didnt want that person discouraging you :)|`|y1VAuh91aa	I wanted to go to a dental hygien program. However, I don't think I want that job now since I found that that job is... a girl's job!. I will try to answer some questions that I know. Anything you do in college you must do two years of general ed first if you are going for a bach degree. Even you want an associate's degree you need 50% to 80% of general ed of bach unless you want just a certificate of something ( a crap)<br>  I don't know why you want to be a dental hygienest. You must be nice and friendly person who doesn't mine easy and uncomplicated job. The salary is low (30~ 45). Most dental hygienests are women. Two years of general education for dental hygine is somewhat simular to many of heathcare carreers such as physicians, nurses, and everything between since you have to take some biologies (although it is easier).<br>  <br>  Dental hygienests sit and do their jobs. So it is not a hard job. However, you are supposed to be percise because teeths are small. If you are good with your hands and working with small objects for a long period of time, you are it. Also, it is important to treat people with respect because they won't come back to you if they don't like your work or the way you treat them. However, you must know that you won't make a lot of money with this job compared to other heath care professionals.

The soviet region controlled by the Soviet Union, was kept separate economically and physically kept people out and tried to stop the influence of the west into the area.  At the end of the Cold war, the Soviets tore down the wall to show the end of tensions between them and to make sure that they showed they were wiling to integrate gemany together.  The wall was also up before becuse the Soviets didnt like what the germans did in ww2 so they felt that they didnt want any help from the us to be given to the german sector, so they kept it isolated.  The wall was ultimatley tore down for 2 reasons <br>  1. it was the end of the cold war and was the major symbol that tensions were gone <br>  2. the soviets had no more need to b in germany so they left|`|c2ca2d5ea74de9e1308a9cabd0fa41b5aa	bulldozers and sledgehammers<br>  <br>  Thanks for the points|`|fae83aaec24e0d804061d9c06a03d0b4aa	the people rioted|`|onnUaV0Raa	I believe David Hasselhoff assumes the total credit for bringing down the Berlin Wall.|`|qIpd1DoLaa	GRAVITY?! :p|`|ytdb0VkUaa	Communist workmanship.|`|3d552fe412ebe26a4c8b43b96bf4ddbbaa	Well, when the Soviets put up the wall they wanted to keep supplies from going into Berlin.

511f5aeedcd688bb382e8547310bfac5aa	If you're interested in philosophy, it's worth minoring it. The point: to expand your mind and study something you're interested in. College is not all about preparing you for a career; it's about learning and exploring and preparing yourself for life. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you don't necessarily have to minor in something to study it. Most colleges leave room in the curriculum for electives, with which you can take pretty much whatever class you want (as long as there are no pre-requisites.) You can take several philosophy classes, but also explore other avenues, and not minor in anything.|`|8184fadfda720775531e01906d23e06eaa	What a coincidence, that's what I was thinking of doing.  I think that is a good idea.  The two both study the mind and human behavior.  For example, one common question in ethical philosophy is "What is right and what is wrong?" If you were interested in that question, you could then go to the psychological side (specifically developmental psychology) and ask "At what stage in life does a child determine what is right and what is wrong?  Is it implemented in them before birth, or is it taught by their environment?"  Hope that helps!|`|tn35LPhyaa	It's actually a great idea and it will help prepare you for future analytical problems.

You never know which is why cal and ucla are both known to have random acceptances. You never know what they're looking for but if you could raise your sat score a little bit more, instead of taking the act, your chances would be very good and i dont see any reason why you shouldnt get accepted. I think its better to study some more for the sat to raise your score because i think a 100pt increase is very possible, instead of studying for another test (unless you've already studied for it), but thats just my opinion.<br>  Just raise your SAT score to 2100 and you have a great chance at all those schools, and you'll most definitely get accepted to ucsd for sure.|`|3d165c62032adabf7b9e36d98720e08aaa	You should be able to get into any of the three universities you mentioned, but you might want to work on your English grammar skills.

However, to go to an American university you will need to do the following:  <br>  <br>  1) Get good grades in high school in a challenging (or even the most challenging) curriculum.  <br>  2) Get high scores on the SAT.  <br>  3) Get high scores on the SAT Subject Tests, if that applies to the colleges that you want to attend.  <br>  4) Take the TOEFL exam and score high on it (if that test even applies to you--I don't know if English is the main language in Costa Rica).  <br>  5) Do extracurricular activities while in high school.  Possibly get a job, if it doesn't hurt you in trying to make good grades.  <br>  <br>  Obviously, get all documents that you would need to become a resident in America.<br>  <br>  To make college cheaper, you can try applying to public universities.  You might want to live/study in a cheaper city in America so that you won't have to pay as much for things like living expenses.

thrVgwEsaa	I believe you ask what a priority app was, not what the deadlines were, right?<br>  <br>  Priority apps, sometimes called "VIP apps" or "choice apps" depending on the college, are usually applications in which you don't have to write essays or pay fees. It depends on the college. These colleges email you asking you to apply using their priority app because you've probably done well on a PSAT or SAT and they want to entice you to apply. If you do like the college, you really should. Chances are you don't have to write as many essays and/or they get back to you quicker and/or you won't have to pay fees. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FReGm4i7aa	depends on the college. a lot are november 1st or november 15th. you have to look on their website under deadlines because each school is different, some schools don't even have priority dates.
550609159aaff6fe19995c7c47f2a8cfaa	I taught two classes at a major university (like, 60,000 students) this past year, so I can give you SOME info about that:<br>  <br>  1)  Don't fall in love with your profs/students.  Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  That having been said:<br>  <br>  2)  The policy for student/teacher romance varies from school to school.  So you should try and research what your particular school's policy is.<br>  <br>  Where I taught, for instance, it was certainly frowned upon, but there was a whole system set up in case "things happened".  Generally, the grading of a student's assignments is transferred to other personnel, or the student just transfers into another course with the same rubric, etc.<br>  <br>  That way, sparks can fly!  Marriages can be ruined!  Hearts can be broken!  All without your grade being in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  Of course, a jeopardized grade is oftentimes the reason why these things happen in the first place.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, there's my 25 cents.|`|AA12151161	Students and teachers SHOULD NOT DATE!!!<br>  Life gets way too complicated really fast!!!
ia0TzACCaa	I homeschooled my son through middle school while working full time. It was the right thing for him at the time, and it was actually much less stressful than having him in regular school. If he had been in school, I would have spent my evenings helping with homework, trying to keep up with what he was being taught by other people, trying to communicate with teachers either from work or in the evenings, missing work for school conferences, etc.<br>  <br>  It was quite a juggling act, but we worked it out. You can hook up with other homeschooling families so your son has people to be with during the day; even get some homeschooling time in with them. You can work with him in the evenings to go over basics and give him some projects or assignments to do the next day.<br>  <br>  If your job skills allow, and you can manage it financially, you might be able to work from home, either for an employer or for yourself. Additionally, you may be able to bring your son to work with you now and then.<br>  <br>  Home school is not just doing school-type work at home. It can involve project time, field trips, self-directed learning, time at the library, work study, apprenticeships, and more. And, unless your state laws require it, you don't have to do all the teaching yourself. There are many homeschool co-ops where parents take turns doing different things with a group of kids.<br>  <br>  For instance, a co-op might be set up where one parent does math projects on Mondays, another one does reading seminars or book clubs on Tuesdays, another does history workshops on Wednesdays, another does art projects on Thursdays, another does science labs on Fridays, and another does cooking and shopping classes on Saturdays. Just as an example. There are lots of ways to do this, and it is very successful to work with kids of different ages.<br>  <br>  If homeschooling is the right thing for your child, there are a lot of ways to work it out. |`|AA10586902	When I was in 8th grade I was apart of a homeschool group where my mom droped me off at my teachers house and then when was school over she would come pick me up. My mom worked a full time and a part time job. Look up some groups in your area and check them out.  My mom wasnt stressed out about it it. Infact she was more stressed when I was in public school . Their are some schools that are like a private school but do homeschool work and activities. If you cant homeschool him who about private school? Go for a school with a small student teacher ratio. Smaller schools in my expericence have been great. I belonged to a school with 47 kids. 9 of the kids that year were in high school. We were a great tight knit family that took field trips and everyone knew everyone's parents. One kid even graduated and got an whole graduation ceromony dedicated to him because he was the only one that graduated that year. But it all depends on your son. But i would suggest if cant homeschool him than do private or a religous school(if your religious)|`|eb1PSrCFaa	I home schooled my daughter during her middle school years, and continue to do so now for high school, while working full-time during the day. <br>  <br>  Some of how this may work for you would depend greatly on the laws of your state regarding the age of minors being home alone, as well as your son's maturity level and his ability to work on projects and assignments while you are out of the house. Some young people are very responsible and able to be left with tasks to complete, while others tend to "goof-off" because no one is there watching them. <br>  <br>  My daughter, luckily, was the responsible type and we continue to do the same things now as she nears tenth grade as we did during seventh. She phones me each morning by 9am, which is when she is required by me to be up and ready to begin her work for the day. I assign worksheets, textbook work, etc., for her to complete during the day and when I get home from work we go over everything and spend about two to three hours of instruction time. <br>  <br>  This works well for us, meets with our state's requirements of number of annual hours of instruction, and allows for a great deal of learning and creativity on my daughter's part. It does require quite a bit from me preparing lessons for her%|`|VF19ylFTaa	I think if you work full time then it's better to send your son to regular school. Home-schooling with full time work is too difficult & will put extra stress on your mind & your son's education might suffer from that. There's another option, why don't you find some officially trianed teachers for your son who could teach & look after him during your absence?|`|BXALhzvtaa	As long as you've got someone to look after him while you're at work you can cover your contribution to his homeschooling in the evenings and at weekends. It's much more efficient being 1 to 1 so you won't need to put in anywhere near the number of hours he would be at school.|`|6vGg8nZtaa	The first answer is true, but realistically, it isn't always the best set up.  It does take fewer hours to teach 1:1, but most kids wouldn't be at their best for learning between 7 and 11 pm....If you're working until 5, that's about when you could start.  Also,  you could teach in the evening, but that is when most social activities for kids happen.  Church groups, youth athletic leagues, ect all meet in the afternoon or evening.  If you're home schooling during those hours, it will be harder for him to take part in those activities.  He could still go on home school field trips and activities specifically for home schooled kids, but you will need a nanny or other care giver who can take him to those activities.  If you can't afford a 1:1 nanny, that would be difficult. An 11 year-old isn't old enough to be home alone in charge of his studies all day.   I would look for the best school situation you could.  Middle school is difficult.  A k-8 school, like a Catholic or Christian School might work.  I am not against home schooling.  I just believe this is one situation where the people who say home schooling is best for all students all the time miss the point of what is reality for many people.
t1Ptg7hsaa	I have a technology teacher just like that and it stinks. She makes us sit there well she checks her e-mail and drinks coffee.

Not vice-principal, not other teachers, nor you rfriends. Please state only facts. Not your opinions. But do express your concerns. This meeting should not be against your teacher, but rather the attitude of standing up for your education. All your life teachers in the lower grades have said you need to take responsibility for your own education, so now you have the chance.<br>  Movies and films, I don't feel, should be utilized to 'teach' but rather enforce what is being taught. May I ask why YOU aren't taking notes? If you want to learn more, take notes, look up concepts you don't understand on the internet.<br>  Show some interest in the concepts taught by asking your teacher questions after the movie/film. Help him understand you are interested in what is going on in history. Make him accountable for teaching. Ask him for a textbook. If he says no, this is another concern to bring up to the principal.<br>  I hope you get this resolved soon as this puts a damper on those teachers who take their job seriously and do their job with love.|`|gwbOwRzsaa	go to sleep and teachers have thier own way of teaching that is why they have a degree and are employed|`|t6MzMHouaa	It all depends on your principal.  No one wants to get rid of bad teachers more than GOOD teachers and GOOD administrators. The way they get rid of bad teachers is not to fire them, but to help them become good teachers.  The principal should set high standards and help the "bad" teacher achieve them by constantly meeting with him to check progress, observing his classes, and requiring that good teachers extend a helping hand to him.<br>  <br>  Before you talk to the principal, write down all the information you can, and be sure to include as much detail as you can.  I would list everything that you did in class for a 2-week period of time.  Even write down the time spent doing the activities.  Do other students feel the same way as you do?  If so, ask them to back you up.  It would be helpful too if some parents would be willing to verify your experiences.<br>  <br>  If you have a written record of the teacher's incompetence in your 2-week log, the principal will be much more likely to listen.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!  Education is so important -- you don't want to miss out because of a "bad" teacher!<br>  |`|AA12116837	talk to your principal, and if that doesn't help, school bord of your city,and go up the line and still practice and learning for yourself

kmFqCDYhaa	Im taking Bio, Physics, History and English Lit.    Biology is the CRAPPEST thing Ive ever done my entire life - I sincerely suggest staying away from it.  Physics is the HARDEST A-Level, so be wary of it   If I were you, Id back it up with Philosophy  (Or chemistry - but a lot of people hate Chem, and taking it with Physics might be too much.)   And Id say  it would also support English, if you take that  Oh, and physics is 25% coursework - 15% practical, and 10%  presentation.  Not many people take an A-Level language, so I think it would be a good idea to take German, its like getting your own private tutor.  Apparantly its pretty much the same as GCSE German, just a lot more speaking.  English is FANTASTIC!   Theres still coursework which is worth 50% of the overall grade, but the course is brilliant and I totally recommend it.  Itll probably be good to back it up with German as well.  Oh, and the school picks the texts that you study.  You WILL have to do a Shakespeare piece though  (Coursework), and probably another play.   This year the coursework is based on Tragedies.  And then theres a selection of poems you do,  and you have to study two novels.  (for the exam)    SO Id recommend those four for you, but its just a suggestion Its entirely up to you.    (P.S. Ethics is crap - avoid it).      EDIT    I said Ethics was crap, cause its a weak subject alone. Besides, English, (possibly physics and chem) and Bio cover a lot of Ethics inside their own course.     English Literature is far  more prestigious than Language. (You only really need GCSE grade language - Try and get an A in that though.) Besides, it draws elements of the language into it anyway, you need to be able to phrase yourself, AND put across your point in your essays and what not.  Dont be fooled though, I take back what I said before about Physics being the toughest A-Level. English Lit is. (Followed by Physics.)   However if you enjoy the subject, you WILL do well.  The texts in English are NOT dull. Seriously - I cannot believe anyone said that!   They are extremely motivating and rather exciting to read.   The books im studying are The Great Gatsby, and The Kite Runner, and I absolutely LOVE T.G.G!  its a literature masterpiece!   The kite runners fantastic as well, and most people prefer that one, Im just weird.    I found GCSE physics fascinating too. A-Level Physics is different and pretty much like pure maths now though.  Of course its Physics based maths though.  Its tough. REALLY tough, so you gotta be prepared to work  yer ar.se off.   Quantum Mechanics is fantastic though (One of the topics covered under physics.)       And btw, you can only take 4 A-Levels Unless ure at a private school, and an absolute genius. Then they  may let you take 5.   Id avoid more than 4 though - its 500 billion times the amount of pressure and stress than your GCSEs.     if you wanna know anything else then feel free to email me. I know how tough it is picking your A-Levels.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	Well, I've never taken any of those subjects,    But you get support, you'll cope.    Make sure you choose the ones that interest you the most.    Good Luck    The 2nd year of A levels is thought to be harder.    don't just pick a levels because you assume it'll get you further.    Btec national is also very good.    xx|`|6I1LFlSIaa	To be honest you will have to look at the syllabus that your college or sixth form is doing as it does vary quite a bit on what you're doing. It doesn't matter what A levels you do, they are all hard, especially your choices, however the universities do love them, and if you're choosing them you know what you're capable of. If you're considering taking all six of them unless you're like a super genius i wouldn't recommend that.   I am currently taking English A level along with History, Music and Economics. I find English quite good, i'd say its probably one of my best choices as i am good at it and enjoy it.  Choose subject you are good at and enjoy. If you want a science do a least two, the rest should fit into place. Have a variety of subjects to keep your options poen unless you already know what you want to do. If so check University website for entry requirements of courses that you are considering to do.    Good Luck.|`|BeFneHRgaa	I'm doing Biology and Chemistry    At the moment I'm not finding them too hard, you just have to apply yourself, if you're not a hard worker then I'd reccomend leaving these two subjects.    Biology in particular takes up a lot of your time.    English is a lot of reading books if you don't like reading book that aren't particularly exciting. I'd leave this one.    Physics and Chemistry are pretty similar in how hard they are.    I've never heard of ethics. lol    Exam set up is different for every examiners board you're on. like AQA for example. It'd be easier to get information if you knew what board you'd be with.    Hope I helped? x|`|ccXJo7xUaa	Im doing English for A level at the minute.    There is 3 modules for AS and 3 for A2. One of these each year will be coursework, in which wou will study a novel (for me AS was Frankenstein and A2 was The Catcher In The Rye) and then answer an essay style question in which you must show argumentative skills.    The other four modules vary. For me, in AS i did Poetry and King Lear and A Streetcar Named Desire. You basically had to compare and contrast 2 poems, and then answer essay style questions on the other 2 novels.    Currently at A2 im doing Chaucer, having finished TCITR. I am also studying The Duchess of Malfi and will be moving onto Virginia Woolf, and these 2 novels must be compared together.    Hoping to take this onto Uni, but just look on the uni's websites or prospectuses for further information.    Hope this helps|`|o0YUIesyaa	I chose English and German. I live in Malta so the exam setup might be different.  For English, the A level exam consisted of 3 3hr papers: in one of them we had to write 2 essays out of 3 about novels we had discussed plus an appreciation of an unseen prose text, in another we had to answer a question on the war poems of Wilfred Owen, another essay on King Lear and an unseen poetry text.  In the other one we had to write a language essay, a linguistics essay and a summary.      For German I had a paper on culture of Germany, Austria and Switzerland and I also had a grammar paper.  I don't remember everything.    I enjoyed these 2 subjects and now I'm following a B.Ed course to teach them both.    Hope this helps|`|AA11515948	Well, it depends what you want to do afterwards!    If you want to do something science-related, like medicine, you will need two or three sciences.  Check university websites to see what A levels are required for any courses you are interested in.    If you don't know what you want to do a uni, go for a mix of subjects: it will leave your options open and give an impression of a well-rounded student.    Other advice: languages are hard!  There is a BIG jump from GCSE to A level, more than with other subjects, which can be hard to deal with at first.  But if you're good at German and you're prepared to work at it, you'll be fine - and everyone else will be in the same boat.    Also maths is recommended if you're doing physics, but it's not vital if you have a good grasp of maths already.  I would think that chemistry would complement physics at least as well as maths, so I wouldn't worry too much about this one.  I'm in lower sixth, doing physics and maths, and I don't think maths does help a great deal to be honest.  Maybe it's more important for A2    I'm also doing philosophy, and I love it - apart from the debates, which liven lessons up, I also find it really easy to revise because it's just a list of theories - learn their criticisms, put them in some sort of order and, voila, an A-grade essay!  Seriously, philosophy essays are really easy to get a good grade in.    I hope this helps :)

ZPLaqdgMaa	No conosco el caso particular de esa u otras universidades pero creo que si estás a un nivel de licenciatura, es suficiente que un catedrático tenga grado académico de "grado", para un estudiante de post grado si deben de ser catedráticos con "master" o "doctorado" ya que el master va encaminado a algo específico de tu especialidad, por el contrario, el nivel de grado es la base general de tu carrera y es en la práctica profesional donde sí va a aprender en realidad, la experiencia no se obtiene con un "cartón" colgado en la pared, se obtiene trabajando con la gente y con el paso de muchos a?os; otra cuestión importante es que la "actitud" del estudiante tiene mucho que ver, se espera mucho del catedrático pero en la gran mayoría de los estudiantes, se deja sentir una apatía por el investigar, el practicar y ser autodidacta, en clases de 30 alumnos o más, es demasiado pedirle al catedrático que la ense?anza sea personalizada, tenga un postgrado o no, tu actitud hará la diferencia, la lectura ayuda mucho.  Otra cosa que venden las universidades es "prestigio" aunque ya no lo tengan, otra cosa que venden las universidades es Status, clases constantes (no como en las públicas que hacen paros por este mundo y el otro) y como en la mayoría de la juventud nos gusta que digan de nosotros que usamos ropa de marca, zapatos tennis Nike o addidas, abber cromby y que "estudiamos aquí o allá", todo eso tiene una valor económico y si te quieres dar "lujos", hay que pagarlos.<br>  Hasta luego|`|4ea588a71c71ad260d2c60d1598e9c24aa	Pagan muy poco, yo trabajé un  tiempo en la Universidad Panamericana, pero por lo que pagan no vale la pena, y los que teníamos posgrado no aguantamos, posiblemente para un licenciado le pareciera bien pagado.<br>  <br>  Además nos querian exigir otras cosas como el asistir a sus ondas religiosas.|`|1sI433xGaa	Ese es uno de los factores que indica la calidad de una Institución Educacional, entre varias otras.<br>  <br>  Aquí un artículo con los factores a considerar para evaluar una Institución Educacional<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mi-carrera.com/eleccion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mi-carrera.com/eleccion.html</a>|`|b7734e5f750e86a94737577fe0c0de1aaa	Existen varias razones.

I begin tracing and "writing" their first name at about 3 years old.  This is not done on lined paper but blank paper.  It's appropriate to have letter, number, and shape visuals out and around, it's appropriate to be sure to write in the presence of the children and talk about how you are writing the letter(s)/number(s) so that the appropriate foundation is being built upon.  It's appropriate to provide many different types of media and writing material so that you as the teacher can see when the child is ready to advance to the next step...since the range in age for writing varies from 3-6 years old.  Providing tactile numbers and letters is appropriate at any age.  Providing "writing trays" such as sand inside of a baking pan, shaving cream on a flat surface etc. definitely helps advance the process.

jaAolejUaa	Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American poet, short-story writer, editor and literary critic, and is considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the inventor of the detective-fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.    He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts; his parents died when he was young. Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short period at the University of Virginia and briefly attempting a military career, Poe parted ways with the Allans. Poe's publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian".    Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem "The Raven" to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years later. He began planning to produce his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.    Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.  He was born Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe, Jr. He had an elder brother, William Henry Leonard Poe, and a younger sister, Rosalie Poe. Edgar may have been named after a character in William Shakespeare's King Lear, a play the couple was performing in 1809. His father abandoned their family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from consumption. Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family but never formally adopted Poe, though they gave him the name "Edgar Allan Poe"    The Allan family had Poe baptized in the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. The family, including Poe and Allan's wife, Frances Valentine Allan, sailed to England in 1815. Poe attended the grammar school in Irvine, Scotland (where John Allan was born) for a short period in 1815, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. He studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransbys Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb four miles (6 km) north of London.    Poe moved back with the Allans to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. In March 1825, John Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt, said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, died and left Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000. By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia. Poe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder, Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, and, not feeling welcome in Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton, he traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.|`|AA12041870	----------------------------------------...    Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), American poet, critic, short story writer, and author of such macabre works as The Fall of the House of Usher (1840);    I looked upon the scene before me - upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain - upon the bleak walls - upon the vacant eye-like windows - upon a few rank sedges - and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees - with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium - the bitter lapse into everyday life - the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart - an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it - I paused to think - what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher?  Contributing greatly to the genres of horror and science fiction, Poe is now considered the father of the modern detective story and highly lauded as a poet. Walt Whitman, in his essay titled Edgar Poes Significance wrote;    Poes verses illustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty, with the rhyming art to excess, an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal themes, a demoniac undertone behind every page.  There is an indescribable magnetism about the poets life and reminiscences, as well as the poems.  Poes psychologically thrilling tales examining the depths of the human psyche earned him much fame during his lifetime and after his death. His own life was marred by tragedy at an early age (his parents died before he was three years old) and in his oft-quoted works we can see his darkly passionate sensibilitiesa tormented and sometimes neurotic obsession with death and violence and overall appreciation for the beautiful yet tragic mysteries of life. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.Elonora. Poes literary criticisms of poetry and the art of short story writing include The Poetic Principal and The Philosophy of Composition. There have been numerous collections of his works published and many of them have been inspiration for popular television and film adaptations including The Tell-Tale Heart, The Black Cat, and The Raven. He has been the subject of numerous biographers and has significantly influenced many other authors even into the 21st Century.    Edgar Poe was born on 19 January 1809 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of actors Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins (1787-1811) and David Poe (1784-1810). He had a brother named William Henry (1807-1831) and sister Rosalie (1811-1874). After the death of his parents Edgar was taken in by Frances (d.1829) and John Allan (d.1834), a wealthy merchant in Richmond, Virginia.     Young Edgar traveled with the Allans to England in 1815 and attended school in Chelsea. In 1820 he was back in Richmond where he attended the University of Virginia and studied Latin and poetry and also loved to swim and act. While in school he became estranged from his foster father after accumulating gambling debts. Unable to pay them or support himself, Poe left school and enlisted in the United States Army where he served for two years. He had been writing poetry for some time and in 1827 DreamsOh! that my young life were a lasting dream! first appeared in the Baltimore North American, the same year his first book Tamerlane and Other Poems was published, at his own expense.    When Poes foster mother died in 1829 her deathbed wish was honoured by Edgar and stepfather John reconciling, though it was brief. Poe enlisted in the West Point Military Academy but was dismissed a year later. In 1829 his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems was published. The same year Poems (1831) was published Poe moved to Baltimore to live with his aunt Maria Clemm, mother of Virginia Eliza Clemm (1822-1847) who would become his wife at the age of thirteen. His brother Henry was also living in the Clemm household but he died of tuberculosis soon after Edgar moved in. In 1833, the Baltimore Saturday Visiter published some of his poems and he won a contest in it for his story MS found in a Bottle. In 1835 he became editor and contributor of the Southern Literary Messenger. Though not without his detractors and troubles with employers, it was the start of his career as respected critic and essayist. Other publications which he contributed to were Burtons Gentlemans Magazine (18391840), Grahams Magazine (18411842), Evening Mirror, and Godeys Ladys Book.    After Virginia and Edgar married in Richmond in 1836 they moved to New York City. Poes only completed novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym was published in 1838. The story starts as an adventure for a young Nantucket stowaway on a whaling ship but soon turns into a chilling tale of|`|5PHpi7GGaa	Edgar Allen Poe was a poet that wrote short stories such as the Black Cat and the Raven.

3cdacd6cb54cafc8aeb7fdfe5694d8a6aa	Childhood Apraxia of Speech is a medical condition that impairs speech function. It is a speech disorder that is neurologically based and affects a child’s ability to initiate and sequence motor movements for speech. The child has limited control of speech muscles.  Apraxia of speech involves a breakdown in the transmission of messages from the brain to the muscles in the jaw, cheeks, lips, tongue and palate that facilitate speech. There is no obvious weakness in these muscles. <br>  <br>  British neurogeneticists at the University of Oxford have<br>  identified a gene mutation that appears responsible for pediatric<br>  verbal apraxia. Studies suggest that the basal ganglia, a region of the brain that controls movement, may be slightly different in individuals with verbal apraxia.  At this point, there jury is still out on what causes it and if it is the same cause for all cases.<br>  <br>  Verbal apraxia is not a developmental delay and a child will not<br>  outgrow this disorder. Developmental delay describes a slower than normal rate of development, but verbal apraxia is a disorder and your health insurance should pay for speech therapy sessions.  <br>  <br>  The most common characteristics is inconsistent error<br>  substitutions (like sometimes the child says cat,<br>  sometimes he says dat, other times gat or cad or cag<br>  -- all for one word "cat").  There are typically vowel<br>  distortions as well, but not always.  It is a<br>  frustrating problem where the brain sends a signal and<br>  it gets "jumbled" on the way, leaving the child unable<br>  to be able to consistently put his tongue or lips in<br>  the right position to make the sounds.  Leaving the<br>  beginnings or endings off of words is common as well. <br>  Sometimes you can actually see groping behaviors as<br>  the child tries to figure out with his mouth just what<br>  he is to do.  <br>  <br>  It really takes a skilled, practiced, clinician<br>  to spend time with him, assessing him as she works<br>  with him and then making adjustments to the services as she sees changes.  It is very difficult.  I am a speech pathologist as well as a mother to a child who has mild apraxia.  Unfortunately, your school speech therapist is probably overworked.  It sounds like your son needs one on one individualized help, so the additional therapy is a great idea.  Some speech pathologists don't have the knowledge base necessary for working with apraxia if they haven't worked with many children with it.  Try talking with the school speech teacher and find out what her level of experience is with apraxia.  Try not to make it "her fault" that your son hasn't improved.  I'm not making excuses for her if she hasn't put the effort into learning what she needs to know to help him, but unfortunately, this is a difficult disorder to work with even with all the education and experience possible.  I'd request home practice materials for daily practice and opportunities to observe the therapy sessions. Best of luck.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	There is a lot of wisdom in this thread, and I am no expert with apraxia, but I will say this...it's not uncommon for districts to miss stuff, especially where speech therapy is concerned.<br>  <br>  My daughter has both Dyspraxia, and dygraphia, which resulted in her having a speech delay. The therapy at school did not help until we found out about the Dyspraxia, a condition her therapist had never heard of. The way they were teaching her, she couldn't do. Later therapists found methods to work with her fine and gross motor issues, including speech.<br>  <br>  Hang in there...after nearly 18 months refusing to speak to anyone, she got placed in a perfect school...and two year later gave the speech at her graduation. She got so comfortable speaking that she's been doing stand up comedy since she was 15...so don't give up hope!|`|3M1R22zraa	My son just turned 15, he was in a car accident just before turning 13, suffered a head injury to his left temporal lobe, he has right side weakness and cannot talk now.

Sounds may come out in the wrong order and he may have trouble saying a word today that he had no difficulty in saying yesterday.<br>  <br>  Generalised apraxia involves motor functions too. - The child has difficulty in selecting and sequencing movement correctly.<br>  <br>  What can you do?

You have to catch it yourself.  ~Benjamin Franklin      Even if happiness forgets you a little bit, never completely forget about it.  ~Jacques Prvert      If you want to be happy, be.  ~Leo Tolstoy      Happiness is never stopping to think if you are.  ~Palmer Sondreal      Most people would rather be certain they're miserable, than risk being happy.  ~Robert Anthony      The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up.  ~Mark Twain      If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time.  ~Edith Wharton      Happiness is excitement that has found a settling down place.  But there is always a little corner that keeps flapping around.  ~E.L. Konigsburg      Nobody really cares if you're miserable, so you might as well be happy.  ~Cynthia Nelms      Happiness is always a by-product.  It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular.  But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness.  ~Robertson Davies      Those who can laugh without cause have either found the true meaning of happiness or have gone stark raving mad.  ~Norm Papernick      Man is fond of counting his troubles, but he does not count his joys.  If he counted them up as he ought to, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it.  ~Fyodor Dostoevsky      What a wonderful life I've had!  I only wish I'd realized it sooner.  ~Colette      The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet.  ~James Openheim      Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.  ~John Barrymore      "Well," said Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop and think.  Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called.  ~A.A. Milne      People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness.  Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost.  ~H. Jackson Browne      It's pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness.  Poverty and wealth have both failed.  ~Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard      Often people attempt to live their lives backwards; they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier.  The way it actually works is the reverse.  You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.  ~Margaret Young      Indeed, man wishes to be happy even when he so lives as to make happiness impossible.  ~St. Augustine      Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants, and to serve them one's self?  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson      There are two things to aim at in life:  first, to get what you want; and after that, to enjoy it.  Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.  ~Logan Pearsall Smith, Afterthoughts, 1931      This is my "depressed stance."  When you're depressed, it makes a lot of difference how you stand.  The worst thing you can do is straighten up and hold your head high because then you'll start to feel better.  If you're going to get any joy out of being depressed, you've got to stand like this.  ~Charlie Brown      Pleasure is spread through the earth  In stray gifts to be claimed by whoever shall find.  ~William Wordsworth, 1806      Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.  ~Nathaniel Hawthorne      Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.  ~Abraham Lincoln      Happiness is a form of courage.  ~Holbrook Jackson      We must laugh before we are happy, for fear of dying without having laughed at all.  ~Jean de La Bruyere      Tranquil pleasures last the longest; we are not fitted to bear the burden of great joys.  ~Christian Nestell Bovee      We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.  ~Frederick Keonig      Happiness pulses with every beat of my heart.  ~Emily Logan Decens      It's never too late to have a happy childhood.  ~Berke Breathed      Happiness is the soundtrack of my life.  ~Grey Livingston      Happiness?  That's nothing more than health and a poor memory.  ~Albert Schweitzer      Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product.  ~Eleanor Roosevelt      Happiness is a direction, not a place.  ~Sydney J. Harris      Of all the things you wear, your expression is the most important.  ~Janet Lane      A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery while on a detour.  ~Author Unknown      If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.

Also, you will need notebooks for all your classes, pens and pencils, a stapler (for your papers), a printer (and ink cartridges), printer paper paper clips, highlighters (in multiple colors), index cards (for making flash cards),  a graphing calculator (if you are taking math, chemistry, or physics class, and maybe economics) (If you don't have one, buy a TI-84 silver edition), loose-leaf paper and some binders (well, whether you take notes in a spiral notebook or on loose-leaf is your decision),  a hole puncher (for if you want to put handouts in a binder), and folders.  Also, you'll want to buy a jump drive if your computer can take one of those, and other things on which you can save documents.|`|4dba21183a9b7a924df1279e98bbdaa1aa	What I used to do was get one 2 pocket folder and 1 five subject notebook, according to how many classes you have, 1 pen and 1 pencil. I would take the items to my first day of classes. the professor's will give you a lot of information on the first day and it is on that first day when you will find out their teaching style. My advice is to wait until you go to class b/c a $100 calculator is expensive if you don't need it or can use a $15 one. Hope it helps

But, if there is only a small amount of kids to begin with, why split them up into many seperate schools when you can just give them each a wing of one school? If there aren't many kids then there should be enough space to have preschool through 8th in one school, it also saves money. My school was in the country and we had elementary school which was kindergarten through 6th and then high school which was 7th through 12th. Since there were not many kids (maybe 500 in each school) it would be silly to have a middle school for only 100 kids.|`|9ZbAsc69aa	hate it!|`|NH5qstOOaa	My enrichment friends went to a school like that.

However, if you are supposed to use in-text citation, you should include a page number, if any, in parentheses at the end of the sentence and the last name of the source author if it is not the NHTSA. If it is an exact quote, put quote signs around it. <br>  <br>  Also, your punctuation on this sentence creates a fragment. It should read:  <br>  <br>  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "the nations 12.5 million drivers...."

PZZkjST7aa	I don't know if this link will be of any help, it's a government site for teachers and it tells you all the legal stuff about religious education and collective worship in local authority run schools, and a parent's right to remove their child; also how this differs in voluntary or opted-out schools, these can be non fee-paying as well, so you firstly need to know what type of school it is.<br>  <br>  A state school can be exempted from the ‘broadly Christian’ daily worship requirement; if there are a lot of non-Christian children in the school, but they can't substitute worship in a different religious tradition, I focused on this because you said the Islamic prayers were mainly the problem, religious education on the other hand can include different religions but has to recognise that something 'broadly Christian' should be involved firstly. Of course nothing terrible usually happens to a school if they go against it, they would just get a rather bad Ofsted report.  If the school is outside the state system you will see that things may be done differently; even if it has become a faith school though I would expect that the Muslim teachers would see it as disrespectful of their religion, and a dilution, to force children from non-Muslim families to say Islamic prayers.  <br>  <br>  I agree in a way though with the person who said it is really up to your sister, but you can help her if she asks for it by getting information about her rights, especially about the suspension, and trying to find out what is really going on, you know that tales can often get embroidered or misunderstood a bit in the re-telling, so you need to be steady as well as fired-up.<br>  <br>  The local education office might have some powers or could advise, even if it is a faith school, and your sister might be able to talk to one of the local councillors, rather than the MP straightaway, there’s no harm in asking around as an alternative to ‘making a fuss’. <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/...</a><br>  <br>  |`|eUi7EFCdaa	I remember when I was young I had to take Christianity class, they made me sit at the back of the room because I was of another religion and I didn't want to be forced religion<br>  <br>  Please take care of your child and do what you think is right.

She must go to a really religious school. Neither my primary or secondary school was like this. RE lessons were totally just about explaining all the different religions to us and comparing them. We had people from different religions coming in to talk to us, but it was done in a very academic way. There was certainly no prayer and I think it is utterly wrong to force a child to pray if they don't believe and also kind of insulting to real believers of that religion. <br>  <br>  Our assemblies were also non-religious. The school was very multicultural and the head teacher thought it was wrong to make everyone attend a religious assembly.<br>  <br>  Some children were allowed to skip the RE lessons BTW. None of the Plymouth Brethran pupils attended.<br>  <br>  I imagine the only option would be for the child to move schools as I can't imagine the school is going to change.

YWD7gudPaa	I was always told that colleges see everything on your transcripts. In my district that is only A+, A, A-, B+, etc. as well as the numerical grade. 4.0, 3.0, etc.  And only semester grades show up. Quarter grades are only temporary and are really no more than glorified progress reports.  So colleges will see, 1) a course name (i.e. Algebra 2/Trig, HP). 2) a leter grade (i.e. B-) 3) an overall semester GPA that totals the entire semester's courses (in my district all six classes).<br>  As for the AP vs IB classes, I was always told that IB is more course and school specific and not recognized by all schools, while AP is solely for college credits. (Think AP as cash, while IB is like a Costco credit card)<br>  Hope that helped.|`|MbumHitfaa	they see everything that your transcript provides. they also look at your essay (if you need to provide one) and what you did during your high school years (sports, clubs, band, etc.) every little bit helps. good luck. you might want to start at a university then move up to Harvard.

Nursing School will better your life and you will be proud of yourself.  You will have a sense of accomplishment.  <br>  <br>  When you enroll, get with the smart people.  Not the dumb ones.

Make it difficult so the wimps could drop out and fail.<br>  <br>  I can tell that you are interested.  Just do it.  Remember these words.

WdXZw3QRaa	I would suggest ending with stats, so after reading your, the reader will see things like, how many people have bulimia and other stats. I would start off with talking about how you were before bulimia to emphasize how it affected the way you acted and to show some of the causes of your bulimia.  Then I would go into your story, showing things like, how you hide your bulmia, the affect on your family and friends and on your body, how you overcame bulimia and the struggle there.  Those are just some general I can think of, it is your story though, so it is yours to tell.<br>  <br>  Your could also start the paper by just talking about bulimia, not the stats, but what it is.  Define it, talk about the symptoms, thing like that.|`|c47f8df8d8d2e4f16d8365876cfd3267aa	If you want to leave an impression, definitely start with something very personal that makes the reader want to go on reading. Think about what led you into bulimia - have you always been a person doubting yourself, your abilities? Did you feel like you were not up to life...? Something like that.<br>  <br>  A "narrative of what happened to you" would not be a proper essay, but just telling a story. Try to really keep in mind that the focus of your essay is not supposed to re-tell details, but your "bump in the road". Try to come up with one or maybe two situations that really stand out, such as the moment when you realized you needed help or that something was wrong, or the moment when you really felt good for the first time again in a longer while etc.<br>  <br>  Stats are something you should, if at all, save for the ending. In the last part of your essay, open up a perspective. You can quote a study about how many girls/boys deal with eating disorders or what the particular reason was for you to slide into bulimia - then definitely keep an eye out for a solution, a perspective, an outlook. Whatever you do, close your essay on a positive, self-assured and focussed note.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your essay and admission. =)

There are many books available to help prepare you.  In addition there are many commercial companies that can help prepare you.  Good luck!
CtFVXC0Zaa	A high GMAT score will help, but not "replace" the low GPA.  Schools usually think that someone with a low GPA and a high GMAT score as an intelligent person who, for some reason, didn't excel at academics.  Schools do understand that people change and you can explain your situation in the admission essays.  One way to show that you can handle MBA courses is by creating an alternative transcript.  You do that by taking some graduate level classes.  It's hard to tell you which school to apply to based on these information.  Business schools are weird and like to talk about the "fit".  I know someone who got rejected without interview by Wharton, but got accepted by HBS.  I know you are not looking at those two schools, but I am just using them as an example.

ldN2FGVdaa	Business and Economics are subjects which not only require you to memorise facts and data. You will have to know how to apply your knowledge in the exams. (e.g. You probably are required to draw graphs for some specific cases). You should not only read through the text book. Try to make some notes on a seperate notebook using your own words. You should also try to do as many exams styled questions as you can and go through the answers using a mark scheme. This, you will get to know what the examiners are really looking for.<br>  In the end, apart from "gaining knowledge", the aim for studying is to pass exams! <br>  Good luck!

Have all the materials you will need.<br>  <br>  In most textbooks the chapters are divided into sections. Such in business Accounting, Finance and so on. What I do is read the first paragraph all the way through. Then i reread it. Then i move on down the page reading each paragraph twice.

9HRkwzruaa	In TX, you just hand the school a written notice that you are withdrawing your child to homeschool, and that's it.  In TX, homeschools are considered private schools, not under the oversight of the state.  The only reason you even need to notify them at all is so that a truancy officer doesn't show up on your doorstep.  I would just walk into the office and hand it to them, and be done with it.<br>  <br>  You don't need to have the curriculum in hand in order to pull him - you don't even have to follow the school calendar.  You should go for the 180 days per year of attendance, but that's incredibly easy - while homeschooling, sooo many things count as school.  You could easily take a few weeks off to transition, check out curriculum and educational philosophies, and figure out what will work best for you and your son.<br>  <br>  There are tons of homeschool families and groups in TX, I would suggest getting in touch with some groups in your area and getting information on activities, curriculum ideas, etc. from them, to get a better idea of what you can do.  In the meantime, pull him immediately and let him get used to the transition.  Spend time hanging out with him, do some fun activities, and read some books or watch some movies that will spark his interest.  When he's ready, go ahead and start into more formal school activities.<br>  <br>  Edit - don't worry about advanced classes - homeschool kids take those at co op (from experienced teachers), at community college, and from DVD classes that they can watch and work with as many times as they need to.  Kinda funny how homeschool kids, who supposedly lack diversified instruction, outscore both public and private school students by dozens of percentage points every year, and many earn full-ride scholarships to colleges all over the country :)|`|YA30kjryaa	...|`|ALcqrSl6aa	I Think You can like write a letter the School or Gov or Administrator or whatever Also I have a quick tip!

I also add in time for breaks and food, because let's face it not everyone can do homework for hours straight.

One should take his work itself as a game. He shouldn't feel tired and enjoy the work itself. One should create a passion in himself for his work. All this can be done as a result of will-power. Be positive and as far as possible optimistic. If you start thinking about something sad immediately divert yourself. Bad thoughts eat away your time and makes you less productive. Remember being productive is more important than working for a long time.

oDgnXJB8aa	I would say that the guy is loose from the nut house, and he goes into a house and tortures the people in the home, one by one. But there's one girl there that outsmarts him right. You can make up really gross ways this mad man tortures the people okay, but the girl hides, he don't know that she is there. And she starts say taking the dead bodies and hides them. Maybe even puts on a mask belonging to one of the people who the mad mad cut off. Any way the girl does some gross things to the mad man, like hides under the table and puts a knife through his feet then runs and hides somewhere else. And each time she comes out she does something else to him. It drives his mad not being able to catch her. And finally she kills him, maybe with an ax and she chops and chops and chops not able to stop.....when the police arrive they think she is the one who has done all the killing. so she is taken to the nut house. and this gives you a new beginning. <br>  How's that?|`|aaAhFxTlaa	He hides in the bathroom. When the person/people walk in to go to the bathroom, he covers their mouth and fills the tub with water and drowns them. They one by one go in. The last person goes in and the tub has 3 people in it dead. The guy stabs him repeatedly until he dies. The only one that is left is the kid that is 13 years old. The person comes out of the bathroom to see if anyone is left. The kid is staring at him upward. (The guy is looking down at him.) The guy says,"Why are you crying?" The kid says,"I have no one to live for. Kill me so I will be with my loved ones." Guy says,"I can't kill you, but they can." *Points to people getting out of tub moaning loudly as they come for the 13 year old.* Guy says,"Run. Run fast."|`|7Ahd9ZRaaa	thats ghost story

hah4QjZKaa	We used to wad up discarded papers and put them in the waste basket. The teacher would see the basket was nearly overflowing and use her foot to stomp the papers down.

He made a point of doing this for about two weeks. The teacher always had to tell him to stop that and take his seat. Once the teacher came in late and saw that the window was open but the student was missing. As she closed the window, she noticed him sprawled out on the ground below.

As a 2nd grade teacher, students assessed with DIBELS need to reach 90 WPM for ORF (oral reading fluency) by the end of the year. In August when assessed, they needed to read 44 wpm. I had some who could read 137 wpm.<br>  To help with fluency, have you heard of 100 Book Challenge? It is a program designed for independent reading, 15 minutes 2 - 3 times a day. It is a colored coded system whereby students read at their level without needing help. they read the same book over and over again for 15 minutes. (I send 2 books home each night b/c I would get borede reading 1 book for 15 minutes) Anyway, I am not trying to sell, so let me tell you to find books your child can and wants to read that are lower level. The more he reads the words he knows, the more fluent he will become. The goal is not to give them challenging chapter books. Fluency is NOT comprehension, it how well a student reads. Being able to express himself without effort, words flow, moving smoothly. Try collecting poems. Have him read the poem 2 times a day for a week. Notice the difference from the first day. <br>  I have had positive results from the 100BC program. We assess our kids 4 times a year.

Ice will become water if it melts.|`|0mVDk7f4aa	True. Sand in a riverbed is eventually pushed to the sides of the riverbank and then compressed by gravity to produce sandstone. Sandstone that the river runs over is cut by the river and loosened back into sand particles.|`|543ad83a8b619cb5553c86ca187f08dfaa	Sand is usually created when water and/or wind break off small pieces of pre-existing rock. If the particle is "newly" broken off, it tends to have an angular look, but if the particle has traveled by water or wind for a long time it becomes rounded. The river's water carries the rocks along the bottom of the river bed.<br>  Coarse pebbles, cobbles, and boulder-size gravels lithify to form conglomerate and breccia; sand becomes sandstone;<br>  For example, at the shoreline, sand is being deposited which will eventually become sandstone. <br>  <br>  Sandstone forms from beds of sand laid down under the sea or in low-lying areas on the continents. As a bed of sand subsides into the earth's crust, The formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of sedimentation of it from either water, as in a river,<br>

BC97yskSaa	OmiGod, I can't believe all the people that said it's a verb!! It is NOT a verb. EVEN THOUGH IT CAN BE, IT ISN'T HERE- added later.<br>  Also, the sentence is a bad one, it is not good English.<br>  You would say. "My first reaction to  And Then There Were None, by Agatha Cristie is that I was impressed."<br>  so it is an adverb. How you Felt. Felt is the verb.<br>  <br>  Later: someone wrote to me and said I am wrong, that it is a verb.<br>  So I went to www.thefreedictionary.com and looked it up.<br>  Impressed is used in many ways. Of course it is a verb.<br>  But used the way it is in this sentence it is not a verb. <br>  And, it is not an adverb either, as I guessed before.<br>  <br>  It is an adjective. It described the person. An impressed person.<br>  Here is the definition from that online dictionary. You all can go there and look it up.<br>  <br>  Adj.1.impressed - deeply or markedly affected or influenced<br>  <br>  You can see that this is exactly the way the word is used in this sentence. "deeply or markedly affected or influenced" by And Then There Were None.<br>  She was. <br>  You have to look not only at the "word" but HOW the word is used.<br>  "I catch." verb. but "I am caught."  adjective. Caught I. Caught me.<br>  <br>  And it certainly isn't a noun. How could it possible be a noun? unless you were using it to refer to some impressed people. Then it would be "The impressed..." <br>  "Singing and wailing, the impressed followed the leader into the church."<br>  but in this sentence, there's a word implied, a word left out. "people" or "crowd"<br>  <br>  You can't say Impressed was underneath the table. (impressed as noun)<br>  We gave the steak tips to impressed. (impressed as noun)<br>  I mean, what sense does that make?<br>  We bought impressed at Wal*Mart on sale. (impressed as noun.)<br>  I searched on eBay and I found a box of impressed. (impressed as a noun.)<br>  Impressed can be seen, but not heard. no<br>  We went outside to watch the beautiful impressed. no.<br>  Impressed is necessary to succeed in the world. no.|`|LZuLpEZvaa	No way.

I can't think of a way that word could be a noun (a noun is a person, place or thing usually and that word is none of those).<br>  <br>  **Don't listen to these people saying its a verb, because its not. Verbs describe either an active or passive action which the noun is doing. In your sentance above the actual verb of the sentance happens to be "is".|`|KMn1Iomvaa	Not in this case. I believe "the impressed" can act as a noun in place of "the impressed audience or impressed members of blah blah." Try "My first reaction to And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie was fascination." or "I was enraptured from the beginning by the book."|`|5MgxhF7waa	No. And the sentence is grammatically incorrect anyway.<br>  <br>  When I read, "And Then There Were None," by Agatha Christie, I was initially impressed.<br>  <br>  (Only use the word "initially" if your reaction changed, otherwise, drop the word altogether.)|`|543ad83a8b619cb5553c86ca187f08dfaa	The answer is yes, it can be considered a noun......it is the act of impressing; and an 'act' is a noun (thing) Your word is used as a noun since it is your reaction (verb) impressed (noun).<br>  Always ask you self "Can you go outside and 'impressed'? |`|13762a663ccece7c93c7dbaf42778b4aaa	That is a very convoluted way to word that sentence. Try it like this: Upon first reading Agatha Christie's book, "And Then There Were None," I was impressed.|`|EF3W3qjzaa	It is an adjective describing what the reaction was.<br>  <br>  For all of you saying it is a verb,<br>  IS is the verb.|`|MhYFGewDaa	No, I think impressed is a verb,  but because Impressed could be a state of mind it might be a noun|`|0e0e4feac933704912794f118c4c908caa	pressing is a noun|`|k3xcEKMoaa	Impressed can act these parts of speech. A verb, "The question IMPRESSED me," or an adjective, "the IMPRESSED girl.<br>  <br>  Impression is a noun, but making impressed a noun is impossible in the English language.

dsKIxhSQaa	The equation of the hyperbola is x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1. The <br>  asymptotes are the lines y = (b/a)*x and y = -(b/a)*x. The vertices <br>  are (a,0) and (-a,0). The foci are (c,0) and (-c,0). The hyperbola is <br>  defined as the locus of points such that the absolute value of the <br>  difference between the distances from the point to the two foci is a <br>  constant. By considering one of the two vertices, you can see that the <br>  constant is 2*a. <br>  <br>  Now consider the point (sqrt[2]*a, b). Its distance from (c,0) is:<br>  <br>     sqrt[(sqrt[2]*a-c)^2+b^2]<br>  <br>  and its distance from (-c,0) is:<br>  <br>     sqrt[(sqrt[2]*a+c)^2+b^2].<br>  <br>  The difference of these distances must be 2*a, so:<br>  <br>     sqrt[(sqrt[2]*a-c)^2+b^2] - sqrt[(sqrt[2]*a+c)^2+b^2]] = 2*a<br>  <br>  When you simplify this equation, you find that:<br>  <br>     c^2 = a^2 + b^2<br>  <br>  This means that the distance from (0,0) to (a,b) (a point on the <br>  asymptote directly above the vertex (a,0)) is c, as you stated above.<br>  <br>  I hope this is what you had in mind as a proof.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	To become a medical doctor, you need a 4-year college degree (major in anything and take the premed courses in bio, chem, physics and math), 4 years of medical school, and 3+ years of residency.  You usually don't go to the same place for premed and med school, and you can do premed anywhere - both Rutgers and Penn State are great choices.  Personally?  I like Penn State.

b375eaa19dd6c56e9909e7ba789daa39aa	Yes, that is the way it WAS. Today's kids are different and we are in a different world than the 50's and 60's. That doesn't give kids permission to be disrespectful however. I agree with the above answer about parents and teachers not being able to control their kids and accepting the disrespect. I blame the video games, the tv, the movies, the lyrics to music - It is an undercurrent of showing how to treat others badly and letting mass psychology rule.   The parents will say it's the teachers, the teachers will say it's the parents. But your first teachers are your parents - The "me" generation does not need to be so self absorbed.  As for the caning and the slipper - I"m sure there were similar stories here in the USA. But teaching by fear is not teaching.   There are many many teachers out there who do teach and do it well. They have the respect of their students without the fear. These are the students who go forward and lead. These are the teachers and the students we don't hear about.   MOre support for your teachers, not just financially, but as a backup to discipline.|`|xDahhvwoaa	Many students are out of control and certain students can benefit from a dose of the old school style; their parents are at a loss with what to do with them, too! However, in this day and age, earning the respect of your students, and keeping them busy bell to bell, and having the right personality, and being prepared stymies alot of behavior issues. It's not 100% foolproof, but it does work well most of the time.     Don't let the rough students get to you; put them in their place early and that will stave off future issues.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	You may think your generation "done well" but by your grammar it is obvious to me aged 36 that you didn't in fact do that well at all. So if that is what teaching through fear achieves then I am perfectly happy with the way things are today. EDIT...LOl...I am British too! What has my age got to do with my maths ability anyway?

On the other hand in today's world employers can distinguish people who are naturally good natured to those who are lazy, in todays world youngsters can prove themselves if they want too, whilst in the 50/60's everyone was more or less treated the same. However I feel the old way is better (im in year 11), I was seriously naughty in year 1-6 and if I had had the correct discipline then I think it would have helped me progress easier across the range of subjects which I am now sitting exams for in a few months time :(

Make one from Mon-Fri and revise a certain subject from 6-7, then take an hours break and start again from 8-9. Do this every night, and try your best to stick to it.

3dREgrQ7aa	Planetary wind belts are related to the general circulation of the atmosphere. In this circulation there are three cells of vertical circulation. Try to picture a cross-section of the earth. At the equator the air rises with heating and in the upper atmosphere begins to flow toward the north. At about 30 degrees north latitude it sinks and flows back toward the equator forming the easterlies in the band from 30 N to the equator. This cell is the Hadley circulation. Between 30 N and about 60 N there is a similar circulation but in a reverse mode. It flows at the surface from 30 N to 60 N where it rises along the Polar front and returns aloft by flowing southward where it sinks at 30N. This cell is called the Ferrel cell. This is the belt of the westerlies. Finally, north of 60 N there is the Polar cell which in the upper atmosphere flows toward the Pole where it sinks and flows southward near the surface forming the polar easterlies. Where the Ferrell and Hadley cells sink at 30 N we have the Horse latitudes an area of generally high pressure. This same pattern is repeated in the southern hemisphere
PDs3ha8Daa	I assume you mean 3x^2+13x-10    Break it down you start with the exponent.  The beginning of the factoring will need to be broken down into 3x and x:  (3x......)(x.......)    The middle number (13) has to be the sum or difference of a set of multiplicative factors that make up the number 10. All the factors of ten are:  1*10,10*1, 5*2,and 2*5    now it's a matter of putting them into the half filled parenthesis above and seeing what works and playing with the +and - signs.  Trying the factors  +2*-5,  we get (3x+2)(x-5).    We can check this by the foil method (first, outer, inner, last) and get:  3x^2+13x-10  Therefore our try was correct as this was the original equation    The final answer is:  Factored out: (3x-2)(x+5)    To solve it further we can find what makes x=0 in all cases.

(x+5)    then put the terms multiplying into the terms in the brakcet into another set of brakets (confusing :S i dont know how to word it properly.....)    the factors of 3x^2 +13x -10 are (3x-2) and (x+5)      (if you cant do this just use the quadratic formula)|`|8wU9D1P7aa	first the 3^2.... it goes 3 times 3 right then the answer is 9...    it goes 9 + 13x - 10....    since 9 and 10 are similar... you can only simplify them while the 13x remains....    9 + (-10) or 9 -10 is........ -1    so the answer is 13x -1    get it??...its the best thing i can do...    Gudluck|`|0sHi6LFWaa	first get the square of 3(which is 9) = 9+13x-10  2nd combine whole  s (9 and -10, which is 9-10= -1  your factored equation  is 13x-1  without parentheses, start left and work right, powers, variables(like X,if known) then whole numbers
KVkU6WSpaa	Sorry, both of you are wrong.  10 x 10 = 100, and 1 million x 1 million is a trillion.    So, the correct answer is:  100 trillion.    This is in the United States.  In England, for some reason, they call a trillion a 'billion'.  Who knows why!    Hope this helps!|`|PG7WfGpHaa	10 000 000 x 10 000 000 = 10 to the power of 14  This is 100 trillion.

drBqkFkjaa	i am pretty sure that it is 3    -(5-7) is 2   -(2-3) is 1    2 plus 1 is three|`|IxXnbZS4aa	you distibute the negative sign:  -(5-7)-(2-3)=  -5+7-2+3=  -7+10    your welcome :]|`|tOaZcxQXaa	-(5-7)-(2-3)  -5-(-7)-2-(-3)  -5+7-2+3  2-5  =-3    hope that helped :)|`|qjcrMtdhaa	Whatever you do, you always have to keep track of your negatives signs and make sure you don't forget them when you move to the next step.     Original problem:  -(5-7)-(2-3)    First parenthesis:  -(-2) - (2-3)    Second parentasis:  -(-2) - (-1)     And since you (should) know that a negative and a negative are a positive: the negative two will switch to positve and the one will as well.     With switched signs:  2 + 1    Final Answer:  3|`|Jh7r1mhhaa	The first post has it right.  The answer is 3.

qjcrMtdhaa	You just have to know the rule for powers really. When something is raised to a negative power, you move that letter(and the number it is raised to) to the bottom of a fraction and the raised number becomes positive.     Ex.     xy^-a would be:    x  -----  y^a      Or for your problem: xy^-3    the answer would be:     x  ----  y^3      (The y^-3 was brought to the bottom of a fraction and the -3 was switched to positive)      This method also works the other way around. If a negative number is on the bottom, you can move it to the top and make it positive.
AA12178390	Unless the teacher tells kids "YOU CAN NOT USE THE INTERNET!!!" they will use the internet and probably only the internet.    I mean who can really blame them.    Lets see I want to know all about the spotted owls or how many moons are around Saturn.     I could A) Get dressed, go outside, go to the library, read the book, find out the book I need is another library go there, find the answer, come home and write the paper.     Or B) Stay home and use the internet in my pajamas.    I am going to use B every single time.    I think more and more teachers are just accepting that the internet is probably NOT a fad. Teachers are just becoming stricter with making sure if you students use the internet they are using reputable websites.|`|kMMY0gdMaa	Internet by far!  It's right infront of us.

xDahhvwoaa	Teachers talk about grades and bad/good behavior of their students, not their personal issues. Teachers I know have compassion, understanding and discretion when keeping confidences of their students. Of course, this is a general rule and it depends on the maturity of the teacher you confide in. Choose the people you confide in carefully. However, the most important thing is to get better and to talk to people you feel close with and trust.     Peace and be well!

janNyNvpaa	pen-e-trate(3)  a-ttacked(2)|`|MINy26pjaa	To find out how many syllables a word has, say the word out loud and count the number of separate sounds that you make.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	The written word is always just a guide to the spoken word. All language is spoken first. Language change happens fastest orally, and we all appropriate language aurally and orally first.    So, there's no fixed rule on how many syllables words have, because people pronounce them differently.    Your two words each have a place where some people will run two consonants together, and some people will make a small break, not a full vowel, between them. So, some people will say something like 'attact', and some people will say something like 'attack-ed'. Actually the sound in the 'ed' bit is not really an 'e' at all, it's what some language scholars call a 'schwa' (it's the name of a Hebrew letter, the name just got picked for the job). In a poem, you could use the word with either pronunciation in mind, and an intelligent reader would adjust his or her pronunciation to suit the metre.    And it's either 'penetrate' with the 'tr' hard together, or some people will sneak in just a tiny wee bit of a schwa.    So, attacked, is either 2 syllables, which is probably the majority pronunciation, or 3 ... or maybe 2.5. While penetrate is either 3 or 4, just depending.    Remember, all the grammar books, dictionaries, and rule books are always just playing catchup. Language changes all the time, and is never very standardised over a large area. Learn to enjoy the flexibility and change.    Edit: but maybe also bear in mind that many people just love rules. They make them feel safe, or empowered. So a lot of people prefer to think of dictionaries etc. as prescriptive or normative, as telling you what the word SHOULD mean, and you do it by their rules or you're WRONG. This is a sad state of affairs, but that's how it is, and many teachers are among these rule-ridden people. So, enjoy flexibility, let your ear and your mouth be your guide as the nightlighter suggests, but do bear in mind that sometimes the simplest thing all round is to give people the answer they really need to hear.|`|UP8i2Ex1aa	attacked - 2  penetrate - 3
