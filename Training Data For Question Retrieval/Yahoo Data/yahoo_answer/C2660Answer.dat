Y8MZCLIQaa	It's normal. Rats tears are a red-ish brown colour. If theres excess excretion it could be due to stress, allergies or illness. If she seems fine and you can't see any foreign objects in the eye then just clean her eyes daily with a wet cotton bud and keep a close watch on her. It's normal for this to happen to rats but it could indicate something more serious. If she's eating, sleeping and pooping like normal and there's no other signs of illness maybe just try changing the bedding you use for her.|`|h73haKxfaa	it could be infected or it could be sleep, my old rats used the get reddish brown sleep on their eyes|`|CVrLmjebaa	Your pet is fine. My hamsters were like this for like a long time but they are okey and don't have problems.|`|sbESha7Vaa	it is normal for rats to have sinus drainage that is red, and since the sinuses are connected to the nose, mouth and eyes this is fine. it happens to my rat, and the first time i was scared too. but your baby is okay, no worries! but keep an eye on the eye that is pink just in case that is a problem. maybe it just got irritated by something.|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	she is proubly infected take her to the vet. She also could have wet tail a deadly sneaky rat disease. Take her to the vet right away.:(|`|po62AbPqaa	that is porphyrin...it is something that rats expel from their eyes and sometimes their nostrils when they are stressed and/or sick    see here:    http://www.ratbehavior.org/porphyrin.htm    she will probably clean it up herself, but she could very well need to see a vet and soon...but first you could try and check to see if there is anything in her cage that could be causing it    BEDDING can be dangerous for rats...they easily suffer from respiratory disease and any type of wooden shaving or paper print etc can cause them to become very sick    I never use anything like that in my cage...my rats have recycled towels, table mats, facewashers, handtowels, tea towels, cotton t-shirts, etc for hammocks and floor mats in their cage. I change daily and put the soiled ones in a bucket with a lid and wash in the machine once a week|`|D8LUpQdraa	I think she's infected. You should probably take her to the vet and see what's really going on before it gets worse.
TkJn9gO0aa	Biggest change concerning the way they laid their eggs.......their eggs were "amniotic eggs" which prevented the egg from drying up and also protected it better from predation and mold........this allowed them to lay eggs away from water.    A precursor to feathers and hair was also a key attribute.......scales. Scales evolved separately with fish and reptiles. Reptile scales are formed from thickened areas of the skin and are therefore integral with the skin, unlike fish scales which can be easily scraped off without damaging the skin......again, this allowed them to live further away from water.    Another change was the pulmonary portion of the 3-chambered heart (4-chambered in crocodilians), which takes blood to the lungs for gaseous exchange. It is more important and advanced in reptiles than amphibians, for instance, because amphibians rely to a large extent on gaseous exchange across the surface of their skin.|`|2z69twcpaa	lots of changes have occurred over the years, as reptiles have evolved they have adapted to suit their environment, , some have lost their legs and become snakes, some have lost their sight to hunt in dark caves, you need to be a bit more specific in what you are asking for us to really answer this question, best of luck with your homework honey|`|AA10743319	Only Darwin knows?
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Mystery (presuming Apple) Snails do not eat living fish, however, if your fish died of other causes, they will eat the body.    Neon Tetras are pretty fragile these days, if you added yours to a tank that wasn't cycled/was newly cycled/was too small, this could cause deaths.|`|yV8fog7Paa	mystery snails can not eat fish (...they are slow creatures) unless they are dead. Then they have a feast! If you have dead mystery snails, too, they have a feast. When one of my big ones died the baby mysteries were all over it, I probably threw away a few babies because they were way up in the shell.|`|bqCmVI7iaa	I think they can if they get big enough. I hate to say it, but.... they might be snail food.|`|tvSG1diNaa	Do you have a good cover on your tank? They are well known to jump out. I've had those fish before, and I've found them stuffed in-between the rocks that cover the bottom of the tank when they get spooked. Take your remaining fish out of the tank and clean it and see if you find the other 5. If no fish are to be found, then someone is taking them out without you knowing it. They aren't known to eat one another.|`|eqTrMY1Vaa	i have never had a snail eat a LIVE fish, because they are too slow (not because they wouldn't). They do eat on dead fish, but don't devour them. I would recommend checking the water. The "fear" that you are seeing may be sickness. Check around the tank to make sure that there are no dead ones and check online to make sure none of your other carnivores aren't the culprit. Check to see if any of the fish have that habit, ie. eating their tank mates. A slow fish could definitely be a cold fish, mke sure the temperature is high enough.  NEONS optimal conditions:  Listed tank sizes are the minimum  Size:  Up to 1.5" (4cm)  tank:  20 inches  Strata:  Bottom, middle  PH:  5.5 to 7.5  Hardness:  Soft to medium. dH range: 1.0 - 25  Temperature:  68oF to 78oF (20-25C)|`|AraBfesHaa	That's exactly what I was going to suggest--the temp of the water.  same thing happened to my daughter's tank.  They kind of look like they're shivering if you look close enough, definitely uncomfortable.  Check your filter, they may have somehow gotten sucked up into it.  My apple snail never ate or killed any fish.  Just the opposite, my mollies killed my snail.  He just minded his own business.  By any means it wouldn't have eaten 4 fish that quickly anyway.|`|8A0j51F0aa	no they will not eat you fish unless its dead.
luwTb77Waa	You might have hit a sensitive spot in her mouth and maybe it irritated it..I would say wait a day or so and see how she responds to it..if she ends up being hurt from when you touch the part or of course it doesn't get any better go to the vet =]|`|iZw3vs2Maa	shes fine. there is nothing to worry about. snow is just another form of water which im sure she drinks alot.|`|gwUMipsUaa	It is just water.

OyNJTWaiaa	If it is a broken blood feather that is the problem you will need to remove the rest of the broken feather. Here is how to do it.      How to pull a broken blood feather    You will need forceps (tweezers) to pull out the remains of broken blood feathers. Support the wing or limb carefully, locate the broken and bleeding feather. Using the forceps, get a good grip around the base of that feather and pull it out in the direction of growth. Use flour for any bleeding. Once the feather is pulled, generally the bleeding stops and further damage is avoided. If you do not feel comfortable doing this please call your Avian Vet ASAP. A small amount of blood loss in budgies can be fatal.    Birds can tolerate a 30% loss of the blood volume, 2% of their body weight, before they show subsequent distress. Birds are very efficient in stabilizing their blood pressure after blood loss. They are able to do this by moving fluid from inside tissues (interstial fluid) into vascular spaces (vessels) and arteriolar vasoconstriction (reduction in diameter of vessels).|`|QxIhMHwAaa	I know it looks awful and is scary, but more often than not a blood feather will stop bleeding on its own. The only exception is if the shaft of the feather that broke is still in the bird (in which case what the previous person told you holds true...or you apply pressure to the bleeding area and IMMEDIATELY take them to a vet...money or no money.    You'd be able to tell very easily if the bleeding has stopped or not. I had a budgie once that had numerous blood feathers but none required me to actually pull out the shaft of the feather.
C3sqTngtaa	nah, they tend to poop whereever they want.  He will sort a corner out where he will wee most of the time, but dont worry if the poo isnt wet he will be fine.  i find poo in my hammy's house all the time, even tho i clean him out regularly.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	that's what hamsters do    they usually pee in a corner,i private,where they feel comfortable  and he will not come to any harm as the pee is absorbed by the sawdust anyway|`|vl0HWTDJaa	No, it's normal for a hamster to pee + poo in the same place he sleeps and keeps his food because he treats that small area as his home where he feels safe+secure, and the rest of the cage is like the outside world where there could be predators etc. Don't worry, all hamsters do it, he's not going to get ill. You could just try putting sawdust in the bottom of the house to soak up the urine better so you don't have to clean the bedding out as often but you can't make him go anywhere else.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	He may just be marking his territory with his scent.  I wouldn't worry about him getting ill, animals are usually instinctive about such things.|`|h4quj3W7aa	get your hamster a toilet bowl ~|`|GrhiWC4uaa	hmmm.. you might want to re locate the position or place of his house...and dont put it in a corner..hamsters will always go pee and poo in corners along with barring their food there..i used to have hamsters and they eventually had  babies..but uhm...i would suggest also not to put too many things in the tank as well...the best thing for a hamster as of cages is this thing called a Habit Trail cage...its only meant for one hamster but they are fun...not as easy to clean as a tank but my hammy loved it when i got him one..|`|FuDHZPpNaa	Build him an en suite|`|0yUnnmdJaa	umm, its good you clean it out regularly. mabye you could make a pot that is comfy but not that possible to sleep in and you could try training tha hamster to do it in there instead? try keeping the food pot away from where he pee/poo's ... lol hopw i helped. but probly everyone else has better ideas...|`|WOxyfCCEaa	this is normal for all hamsters, i've a fren whose hamster also does the same thing but if u're still worried u can bring u're hamster to the vet|`|bo3CuPzeaa	Hamsters usually always excrete their waste in the same place, so nest time you clean out your hamster, put some of it in the area where you want it to "poo" and then next time he does his business, he will do it there instead of in his house.
0kh2HEFMaa	I think horse with stocky necks and bodies look good with this type of braid:    http://www.fieldstonefarm.org/images/man...    and for the tail, I like this one:     http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/hor...|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Do button braids, but keep them about 2 inch. apart. I showed a horse this past summer who had a shoet neck and these braids made it ook longer. you could never tell she had a short neck.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I'm particular to button braids on horses.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	I would think the type of braiding they do in Portugal.  This is basically two braids, one each side of the neck, like french plaits (sorry! braids!) often with coloured ribbon woven into it.  It is used a lot on bull fighting horses and has crept into the showing scene; Think this would look good because Lusitanas , especially stallions, have very big necks.
GrhiWC4uaa	getting another bunny wont solve anything...the rabbit may be simply rejecting the cage due to the joy of being free...its a nervous thing...also rabbits shouldn't have that much stuff in their cage at one time..i would leave 1 or 2 toys in there and alternate them 1 x a wk.also rabbits chew because of their teeth constantly growing...they usually need something to file them down..but its nothing to worry about..my floppy did that to...maybe buy the bunny some nesting stuff,to make a comfy spot in the cage...gave my bunny something to do...|`|vxXQdu76aa	He might have ADHD, try some Ritalin|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	If I gave you 5 things to do/play with every day and that's it...over and over and day after day. I bet you would be bored and chew the bars too. It is a behavior that indicates stress and I would suggest getting another rabbit so that yours can have some company. 5 hours of freedom out of 24 means that for 19 hours a day your rabbit is alone with nothing to do but play with 5 things. Think about it. He wants out. And he wants it now. Get him a playmate.|`|tAZe8XJsaa	My bunny has lots to chew on in her cage as well, but she tends to chew on the bars when we put her in her cage.    Mine seems to have taken one of my couches as territory, haha. So I keep her cage next to that, and she just jumps straight onto it. She never wants to go anywhere else, not sure why... but it suits me.     It just means your rabbit wants out. The only time my rabbit gets put away is when I'm sleeping. If you're out most of the day you could maybe ask a friend to go to your house and let the rabbit out for an hour or so.
X1cVlshoaa	It really depends on you and your lifestyle.    Dogs love attention and need somebody home a lot of the time. They are very affectionate but quite a bit more work and cost quite a bit more.    Cats don't really mind being alone sometimes yet depending on how you raise them they can learn to love giving you cuddles. They are cheaper and very easy to look after.|`|Cp8Y0cHcaa	dogs are allot better  cats are lazy and just meow all the time, and want food all the time    Dogs are very playfull and are always happy to see you, they make you feel loved in return.|`|Kxk3ZbWMaa	Well i myself am equally a dog and cat lover.    Cats are affectionate, quiet, cosy animals.  Dogs are energetic, loyal, loving animals.

I am equal on both.    Cats- lazy, but in a funny way, calm, loving, affectionate, (when it wants to be,) all you have to do is feed them, clean the litter box, and play with them.

GEeaONhGaa	Hi there, it may be an idea to get her checked out by your vet, but my youngest German Shepherd had seasons every 2-3 months, trying to work out when to book her to be spayed was great fun, she ended up having 3 seasons before we managed, it's not the norm for seasons to be so frequent but it does happen, talk to your vet. Also it is usually not advised to breed from a ***** with this tendency.|`|q1b7170caa	My sisters Great Dane had her first 'season' at 10 months and the second at 12 months.  After that they were 6 monthly.  I think it was a 'practice' for the real one|`|f1kRtbMAaa	Sometimes dogs will have what they call a split heat.Meaning the first one wasn't   a full cycle and so in a couple  months the cycle will finish.If it is a heat cycle she will have the typical swelling,ect .If you have breeding plans wait until her cycles become more regular.If they don't then there are other issues at hand(ovarian cysts a possibility).|`|9kTejB0uaa	Well if her first season was a full 21 days affair, and not just an in and out again, this definitely isn't normal.  I had a ****** who came in roughly every 5 months - and got her spayed without taking a litter from her!!  If you had her out (off your property) during her first season it is possible she picked up an infection.  I think you would be best getting her checked out by your vet.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	No, it isn't normal. The average time between seasons is 6 months, some b1tches are as often as every 4 months, some only once a year but 2 months signifies a problem.  It could possibly indicate a uterine infection which can be very serious. Hopefully, it's just a hormone imbalance but take her to the vet to have her checked out.  Good Luck|`|AA12083992	No, not normal. Dogs come in heat about every six months. See a vet, there must be another problem. There are health benefits for spaying also.   No Pregnancy or Pregnancy Complications    Spaying, or ovariohysterectomy, is the surgical removal of the animal's ovaries and uterus. By preventing pregnancy, spaying permanently eliminates a source of great physical stress for female animals, including complications such a ceasarian section delivery of the puppies or kittens. What's more, spaying female pets eliminates:      Attendant males in abundance while the female is in heat    Spotting during the heat period    False pregnancies (increasingly common with age)    Mammary tumors (less than 1% incidence in animals spayed before their first heat, versus higher than 50% incidence in intact female dogs over 5 years of age)    Uterine infections (increasingly common with age; often life-threatening)    Tumors of the ovaries or uterus    Stress, leading to increased susceptibility to disease    Need for extra food during pregnancy and nursing  In female dogs, heat periods occur twice a year and last about 3 weeks each time.  http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Take her to the vet just to make sure all is well.  My GSD looked as though she was coming into season again 2 months after her second season.  I took her to the vet and she needed emergency surgery for pyometra.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It isn't normal for seasons to be only two months apart, no. Take her to a vet please - no way can anyone on here tell you if this is a season or urinary infection or anything else. If it is a season it's a bit worrying - ANY abnormalities in seasons should be checked out as you should always been on the alert for pyometra.    If you're not planning on breeding from this dog, please have her spayed. This will protect her from pyometra which is a very nasty and very common womb infection that results in her having to be spayed anyway to save her - better to do it while she's young and healthy!! Spaying her before her 3rd season may also still allow some added protection against mammary cancer -the reason it's preferably to spay before the first season.    Please see your vet for proper advice.    Chalice
7qoTSvRzaa	We have 2 cats and one of them is totally OK with the leash and the other does not tolerate it all. We take our one cat on walks all over the place with her leash. It is not going to be the same as walking a dog on a leash and showing who is in charge. The cat will mostly lead the way but you can direct her/him to move and go where you want to go by tugging on the leash lightly and to reward the cat with treats when it follows your lead.    It all depends on the cat but I think the key is to train them when they are young and to reward them with the right treats.|`|jG3MucACaa	I don't completely get your question, but I think I get the jidst...    Yes, cats can be trained to walk on a leash, my friend walks her cat all the time, infact, her cat enjoys it...    :)|`|rOKRvcgpaa	One of my cats walks on a leash (but of course it's really just me following him around and picking him up if he's intent on going somewhere he shouldn't) and the other one just lays on the floor and plays with the leash.  I got them used to the harness and lead really young and the one guy just took to it while the other still can't figure it out.|`|bB0qV51Haa	I used to have 2 cats that were leashed trained. I lived in the city at the time and they did quite well with it. They didn't like to walk near the curb and I was always careful to keep the leashes short in case they got spooked.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Not really although some cats have successfully trained their owners to walk on a leash.
DLxh9CANaa	First of all, calm down, or you'll give yourself another seizure- they frequently are triggered by emotional upsets and stress, as I am sure your doctors have told you. Second, I worked once on a breeding farm which bred Egyptian Arabians, and there was one mare there who was bred back to her own sire one spring. The next year, she gave birth to a beautiful filly, who was eventually named Negma ( which means "star" in the Bedouin language) because of the pretty white star on her forehead. Negma ( the g in this name is pronounced as a j)  was perfectly normal, not deformed in any way, which I think may provide you with an answer concerning what a foal from an inbreeding like this would look like out of your mare.  Inbreeding of this type is not all that uncommon, especially among certain breeds and breed types, such as in the Egyptian Arabian. Frequently, it is done to preserve specific traits which are considered really desirable, such as strength, or a calm disposition, which is another characteristic these horses are famous for.     The best way to find out if your mare is in foal is to have her palpated and ultrasounded by your vet, who can tell in a few minutes whether or not this is the case. Sure, you may have to pay a hundred bucks or so for the farm call, but having some peace of mind will make it more than worth the price. If she's not in foal, you can relax- and if she is, knowing about it will help you plan for the future. And by the way, I DO NOT consider this to be your fault, if by chance the mare is in foal. You had and have a legitimate reason for not paying closer attention to or being able to deal with your horse's situation, and having people here yell at you for it is NOT going to improve anything.     Good luck to you, and I hope things work out- and that you feel better soon.|`|9N56lFMaaa	Many excellent quality horses have been produced by breeding father to daughter or mother to son. However, like in any breeding, if both horses have the same conformational or genetic problems, the resulting foal will have a much greater chance of picking them up. Depending on the mares breeding and conformation, you may get a really nice foal. Line breeding and inbreeding are not exactly the same thing and they have nothing to do with the quality of foal produced. Line breeding is intentionally using a common ancestor on both sides of the pedigree, inbreeding is using father to daughter or mother to son. Most people do not breed full sibling to full sibling though.|`|px27V5N9aa	No you don't have to worry.  Normally in these instances all works out fine but there is at times the glitch where the inbreeding comes into play.  Health issues.    My horses are also linebred and I was just talking to a guy that bred his one mare back to her brother.   I've seen daughter bred back to sire.  All of the babies were fine and most are in show now.    It happens, these little 'oops'.  Get well, take care of yourself and relax!|`|RloOJ43haa	See arr harr knows her stuff and gave you a great answer.     I'll just add that getting the vet out and actually finding out for sure if your mare is pregnant may solve the issue once and for all.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Usually in these types of situations, if it turns out OK it's called linebreeding, and if it's not OK it's inbreeding!    If the horses in the line are all conformationally excellent, move well, have been sound and healthy, and most importantly are nice people, the chances are any offspring would be OK.  No it's not ideal or desirable, but you already know that.  The problems would occur if one of the horses (either of the parents, or much further back) had a problem which could be passed on genetically - whether it's poor hocks or a crazy temperament.  It's generally not good to have that once in a horse's genetic makeup, but if a mother and son have been bred you're obviously going to have the same animals on both sides, so the chances of any abnormalities showing themselves are doubled.    Inbreeding doesn't immediately result in a horse being born with two heads, but there is a much greater chance of inherited problems showing themselves.  And I'm sure you already know this, but all the same it wouldn't hurt to say it: the foal (if there is one) should not produce any offspring.  Hopefully it'd be a colt, and then it's very easy to make sure it never reproduces!    Hope you're feeling better...|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I've known a gal who accidently bred her stallion to his daughter and the foal came out healthy and fine (Another Quarter Horse, BTW).  The foal grew up healthy and sound got broke, sold and all without problems.    I concur with the other posters on this.  If the horses have no faults, then there shouldn't be any problems.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I would call the vet and have your mare ultrasounded to see if she's pregnant, you may be worried over nothing.    If the mother/son inbreeding (different from line breeding) was done repeatedly throughout the line you would most likely have problems. But for her offspring to cover her you *should* be okay. He only has half her DNA.
jyGTlpzTaa	Hedgehog!!! They are not furry but they make up for it, how adorable are these guys:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK0l2tqFD...    Ignore the stupid music and the toilet roll tube bits are just cruel, but they will just make you melt with their cuteness.    They are cute and funny, become very tame (they wont spike you then), and it is very unusual for them to bite. They do need daily attention to be tamed though.|`|GrhiWC4uaa	the only exotic pets i can think of with fur are wolves,tigers and lions....but i dont think they are legal...may i suggest a iguana?they dont have fur but they are easy to care for and mine grew to be over 4ft long..and they are really awesome to look at...iguanas live a very long time...about 20-30 yrs i think or possibly more..|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	Hm. Maybe a wolf?|`|fCgfReMiaa	A parrot!|`|LzkSscDSaa	Best pet i can tell you is definatly without a doubt a ferret! I have them myself....        They are awesome pets, they live for quite a while, they are extremly lovable, Love  to be out of there cage and run around, although it is best to get ferrets in pairs! They sleep 20 hours out of a day so there not a handful, BUT they do take alot of TLC =) They love lounging around but they do like to run around and play! expecially my girl ki ki dee, pe'pe is well.....alittle obese ^^ haha Overall they are really great pets, you should really give it some thought, you wont be dissappointed! Thats a promise!|`|sfUUml0Daa	a monkey or a racoon. ^^ theyre both soo cute,|`|jJ06EBLuaa	A ferret?|`|gvGjrGheaa	No exotic pet starts out friendly, they all require taming and training to become tame, you have to deal with biting and scratching and snarling until you have tamed your animal, it can take a very long time. That said, heres some options:    African pygmy hedgehog: More spiky than furry, but easy to tame and make a great first exotic pet, as they are simple to care for. Just   require a large rabbit tank, heat mat with thermostat and high quality cat food. For a tame hedgehog you need to handle them for about an hour a day.    Short tailed opossum: Require a largeish tank, the right humidity, and again, cat food. They require a lot of taming cos they will bite freely, but they are sweet, cute and loveable pets when tamed.    If you want more work, you could consider sugar gliders.

426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	She should be fed 3 times a day until she is 6 months old, then twice a day from there.  Follow the feeding guidelines on the bag and adjust slightly if needed.  A pup should be slightly plump ( not big, not skinny ) as they are still growing, once they are a little older they will start to look more like lean adults.    I have a lab as well, he used to do the same thing, they looove their food!  Be careful though "gulping" food and high activity before or after eating, among other things, can cause bloat ( gastric torsion ) and labs as a breed are susceptible to this.  I personally throw a few of his toys in his dish which slows him down considerably because he has to eat around them.  For now it works because he hasn't figured out to take them out.    Found these sites as well:  http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm  http://www.woodhavenlabs.com/bloat.html  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...|`|vJwVRrEJaa	My dog is already 1 year old and I used to feed it 2 times a day, but I found that he didn't eat his dinner and only eats he's breakfast, so now I feed it once a day.    It really depends on the dog a lot of the time, but in your case because he's a puppy at 4 months, I would recommend you feed him 3 times a day. If you really do get worried about it, I STRONGLY recommend that you go see a Vet and discuss it with them.     After all, they ARE the ones that know what's best for your puppy...  Also, if you're a person who is always busy and doesn't really have time to feed your dog by hand EVERY SINGLE DAY, then you really shouldn't even think about starting to hand feed him. This will only get him used to being hand feed and will only eat if you hand feed the food to him.    Sorry for not much help but anyway...    GoodLuck =D|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Is she throwing up a lot? She should be at the vet....    If its just gulping of the food, try 4 feeds a day... and maybe feed some by hand (if its dried) this will slow her down and also helps teaching food manners.|`|0v7Msiznaa	hmm i would take her to the vet and she if shes ok.  i would feed her 2 or 3 times a day.  hope the little mite will be ok.|`|W9pm19Ttaa	I recommend you buy "Nutro","Innova", or "Canidae". Look for any of those brand names in the "Large Breed Puppy Formula". Feed him 3 to 4 times a day and you should be all set. Don't start changing his food to "Adult" dog food until he is anywhere from 10 to 14 months old|`|b1TjlYODaa	A puppy eats a lot of food. From birth up to six months of age, he'll need to eat two to four times as much as an adult dog to support all that growth. In here http://elfurl.com/l9v4l are some of the basics in feeding a puppy.|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	half a cup three times a day no activity or water 30 minutes before and after...and see a vet if this keeps up.  my dog also eats real fast; try whistle feeding....on a leash step on the leash set the food bowl down where dog cant reach because you are stepping on leash, have dog sit and wait then blow whistle and let dog feed.  good luck
ard3L0hHaa	She may have allergies.  Make sure she is eating a quality food.  One that does not contain corn or wheat.  Many dogs are allergic to these ingredients.  Also make sure she is bathed it a gentle shampoo as well.  If these things don't work your vet should be able to help you narrow down the source of itching.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	You can help her by taking her to a vet.    Fleas are the most common reason for scratching but mites, allergies, behavioural reasons are other possibilities, among others. Obviously she's uncomfortable so she needs to be seen.    When you're looking for fleas, check the belly, groin and rump areas specifically and look for little black specks/flakes that look a bit like black dandruff - these are flea dirts and you're more likely to see them than the actual fleas. Also, if your house hasn't been spayed with a decent flea spray recently it's not out of the question that there are fleas in the house which are hopping on the dog, biting and leaving. Most dogs that are not being regularly treated with proper flea treatment (from a vets) will have fleas.    Chalice|`|Sng3heoEaa	Maybe she is allergic to something in the house or garden? Or she could have ring worm.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	It could be many things, shampoo not rinsed out, being fed crappy food, fleas, your house may be very dry, etc,etc.    Why haven't you gone to the vet????  Don't you think you should?|`|DVtulTReaa	There could be a number of reasons. She could have a skin condition (only to be determined by a vet), she could have been bathed before you got her and she might have an allergy to the shampoo or they might not have rinsed her off well, she could have food allergies to something she is eating, or she could have mites or the beginnings of something you cannot see yet.  Be sure that the adopting family knows there is a potential problem and be sure the shelter is aware. The shelter should have her looked at by a vet, preferrably with you there to discuss her symptoms. Maybe the new owners would still be willing to take her if they knew what the problem was and how much effort it will take for treating her.|`|W9pm19Ttaa	If you think your dog parasite is a flea, you can confirm your suspicions by taking a closer look at his skin: you probably wont be able to see the fleas themselves, but you should be able to see what looks like ground pepper (a thin sprinkling of fine black grains) on his skin. This is flea dirt (poop).   If you groom him with a flea comb (which is like a fine-tooth comb), try wiping it on a paper towel: if red blotches show up on the towel, you know that your dog parasite is a flea. (on a white background like a paper towel, flea poop shows up red: since fleas subsist on blood, their poop is colored accordingly).
CVrLmjebaa	Nope. Grinding teeth means they are like hungry, angry and fierce kind of emotion|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Grinding their teeth (bruxing) is often a sign that they're happy, and can also mean that they're anxious or scared, or nervous. It's hard to tell when your rats are bruxing, whether it's because they're nervous or happy, though. If you reckon their scared just look out for any normal signs that they're worried, being a bit jumpy at any movement, or just a bit freaked out.  Also, if they're bruxing because they're happy, there's a good chance that they'll also start eye popping!! (Don't really know the correct term for this!) But basically it's something they do often when they're very happy. The first time my first rats did this, i was very freaked out, but i learnt that they're just very happy.  Maybe the reason they started doing this was because they were just nervous of being somewhere they hadn't been in for ages!  |`|An2AopAqaa	Are your rats male? A lot of male animals do this when they are, erm, "in need of a female". [:|`|X7DDlR1caa	ugh the thought of teeth grinding makes me cringe!|`|MHXD3BwBaa	maby they were thinking "im gona eat this ******"|`|po62AbPqaa	did they show other signs of behaviour...ie that indicated say nervousness    if rats act nervous then you can usually tell...otherwise bruxing is when they feel relaxed, safe and content enough to take time for a little body maintenance...lol  :>|`|ZkPvYnP5aa	my mum and i have found that they do that when theyre sitting up high on our shoulders, and running around on the beds. so i'm guessing they grind their teeth more when theyre happy, or talking to you. i sometimes tap my teeth together lightly and imitate their sounds, our 3 eldest girls always brush up against our faces when we talk back to them
fzi6I3CUaa	Yes.  I used one for about 6 months with my very strong and excited to be going out border collie!  Now he walks like a dream on a normal collar and lead.  he went from being a nightmare to walk to a pleasure.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	A collar, leash and training are the only thing that you need. Gimmicks cannot solve all problems. Pay the money to someone that will teach you how to control the dog|`|vPde97E2aa	NO!  *****TRAINING******** will!  Gimmicks are for the lazy squeamish AR-brainwashed.     Get a properly fitting chain/slip/prong collar & have an experienced ADULT show you how to USE it!  POP & RELEASE!!!  REPEAT...ad nauseum.....that's called TRAINING & DISCIPLINE!|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	we used to have a st bernard that would drag us across the road if she wanted to go see something which was dangerous.    someone suggested a harness rather than a normal lead. we tried the harness but it didnt work at all.    we then got a halti and it was great. she didnt pull one bit. it did take her a while go get used to it. she kept shaking her head all the time trying to get it off but she stopped after a while.     she didnt pull at all. it was an amazing transformation.    the only thing is that the halti's need to be the correct size as even when they are the right size part of it is close the dogs eyes so if they are too big then it will rub their eye and cause sores.    our neighbour has an old english sheepdog and he uses a halti on him too and he swears by them.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	i use harnesses on my husky and border collie since they like to pull and the husky is over 100 lbs. use ur halti or a good harness and when u walk ur dog stop every few yards and make hin sit and stay then continue on. as he gets use to the pressure on his shoulders all u will have to do is pull up and he should stop. work with him daily until he knows the feeling of u being in control of his movements. good luck|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	No, but it will give you more control. They are many types that will stop pulling though. Go to your local pet shop and ask for advice!|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Nope, proper training of both you and the dog will stop the dog from pulling.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I use one and it's great.  Need to use training with the halti, but the halti is a very useful tool for us.|`|I0qkCacKaa	It will help I`ve two dogs of a similar size the halti worked on the first one but not so well on the second,get him into a training scheme as soon as you can,|`|W9pm19Ttaa	Halti dog training collars have been invented for those dog owners who are not as strong as their dog physically or mentally, and those petite owners who are lucky enough to weigh less than their canine companion.    Haltis are designed so that the dog can have their pointing straight ahead and they also come in a number of varying sizes (thank goodness). When you gently pull on the leash, the halti collar brings the dog's head around in the direction you are steering, ensuring that the rest of Fido's body follows in the same direction. I think this will solve your problem!|`|gUsJlTvKaa	Yes a halti will help, but it might take a little time for him to get use too. Even better than a halti, which is very similar is a product called a Gentle Leader. This does a better job than the halti because it fits to work the pressure points to help to control the dog more ( there is a dvd that comes with it that explains it ). But even with any of these products you will still need to work with him so he gets better.|`|e4468c68a78bd0fee466df4def593624aa	A Halti is probably a good idea but owners / handlers that resort to them are often missing the point.  A dog walking (or pulling) in front of you is classic dominant behaviour.  He is the leader and you are the follower to go where he wants you to go. In order to correct this, the dog has to recognise you as its pack leader.  Once he has done that, he will do as you want and the choice of collar becomes largely irrelevant.  You own a very strong and wilful dog which needs training - often more for the owner's benefit than the dog's.|`|q1b7170caa	It wont stop him completely but will make him better.  I use a gentle leader for my Border Collie and she is a lot better|`|3HSNFDaJaa	My Boxer still pulls with a Halti but makes a walk easier but does not stop thepulling altogether, I actually find a body harness and shortish lead easier.|`|AA10063059	i use one on my lab/spaniel and it makes walks bearable|`|AA11773011	this type of collar is great.It will help train any dog to walk correctly.
1bRRODd2aa	I feel for you.  An adopted, previously abused Chihuahua, can be a nightmare!  I wish both you and the dog the best, and let's hope you can rehabilitate him...    You probably won't find a muzzle of the type you require in the UK, but you will certainly be able to find one online.

Of them all, the wire muzzle would be most suitable for general wear as it will allow him to behave normally and drink etc.  Also, it won't matter if the circumference is a little loose as long as the strap round the head is short enough.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	pets at home have you tried there the dog maybe nervous around people making it aggressive he needs time love and patience|`|MfmCH8Abaa	try ebay or a uk online petshop|`|kovBZS8saa	the rat section in most pet shops shud have one in his size.  i wouldnt worry about your little monster hurting the horses,one carefully aimed kick from any horse and you will be taking tha muzzle bak 2 the shop for a refund.|`|vPde97E2aa	Never heard of *TRAINING/DISCIPLINE*?????????    Works like MAGIC when you get after the nasty little monster!|`|uTA2TLC6aa	Why not google for the breed club? If you talk to someone there you might get some tips for specialist sources, and maybe some ideas about his problems.|`|N83Po9PZaa	for a quick fix or emergency, use a tube sock or length or pantyhose (look then up if you call then something else) hold it by the ends, out in front of you. Put the middle of the 'sock' on top on the dogs nose, pull both ends down and cross it under his chin. After you cross it, pull both back behind his head, under the ears and tie it off at the base of his head.    Quick fix only, like if you're in a sticky situation and need to control him and get out of a bad spot.    Have you tried watching Cesar Millan's The Dog Whisperer? There might be some extra tips you could add to what you're already doing. Other than that, I think the person suggesting a rat or ferret muzzle is on the right track. Or maybe a leather worker could make one, or you could have one modified, like you'd have jeans hemmed???    Good luck, and I hate it too, when people give snotty answers.
NMcFF0Iwaa	My 2 adopted silver point siamese don't bite, but my adopted chocolate point siamese is a biter.  I'm her 3rd adoptive Mother, so she is over the age of 3.  I've had her 6 months now, she was super biter at first, no matter where I petted her.  Now she bites if touched from the middle of her back to her tail.  With time & trust, she is getting better.  I doubt she will ever quit, she bites the other cats ears to get them out of the food dish or if they get too near her.  She doesn't like them to come sit next to her.  Sometimes she just gives them a mean eye, then a swat with a paw.  To me, fake biting is when they are playing with you, when you are tickling their tummy.  A real bite, is when they bite immediately upon or near getting touched.  I show my biter my pointer finger before petting, which she now knows means don't bite or I will give you a mean tap on the forehead.  With time, I rarely have to show her the pointer finger anymore.
jA1nfMeyaa	No, that is not normal behavior for Spaniels.  Cocker Spaniels have been terribly overbred, which has led to many temperament problems in the breed.  There are many poorly bred specimens that are NOT the sweet and merry dog as stated in the breed standard.  Cocker Spaniels are supposed to be friendly and merry dogs.  They are not supposed to be excessively fearful, timid, possessive, aggressive, etc.   Odds are that your pup was a product of poor breeding practices, which could explain his incorrect temperament.    Training can help resolve most of his problems if he's just your typical spoiled brat, which most Cockers are these days.  Hire a dog trainer to evaluate your dog and work with your family on how to resolve the problem.  You're not doing the dog any favors by sheltering him from meeting new people.  The dog needs to learn that there are always going to be new people coming and going and that it's not up to him to decide who is friend or foe.  Also, this possessive behavior he is exhibiting toward you is a BIG problem.  You and the rest of your family need to put the dog in his proper place, which is at the lowest level in the family hierarchy.  Possessive aggression should be dealt with immediately and firmly before it escalates into something much worse.|`|b1TjlYODaa	Some breeds tend to be very protective. Get him into some socialization. Puppies who aren't socialized can grow up to be fearful of other dogs, people, and just about anyone and anything outside of their routine and that fear can lead to aggression. These are the guidelines http://elfurl.com/utvkh, http://elfurl.com/ri2n1  that should help you with.|`|W9pm19Ttaa	When a dog growls, barks or whines at the sight of a stranger, it shows that he is nervous and apprehensive. He treats the entry of the stranger as a threat to his physical safety. One of the reasons for this type of aggressive behavior is improper or inadequate socialization.  It is important to note that a dog growls when it feels a need to protect its space, while a dog growls when it is angry, they often growl intending to warn you when they feel frightened or otherwise feel a need to protect themselves. Therefore, you can avoid being growled at if you take steps to prevent the dog from feeling threatened.   I would work on improving his socialization!|`|4m8tTmlSaa	Get it put down.
T0pkW783aa	Jack Russell dogs are very high energy pets!  They require constant attention and want to be in on any and everything that you are doing.  They can run circles around other dogs and never seem to tire of the constant movement.  If you don't have time to spend with your dog or you are more laid back and not into lots of outside time and exercise, I would encourage you to consider another breed.  (My son has a Jack Russell and she is very sweet but requires a lot of time and energy!!)  His dog goes everywhere with him and wouldn't have it any other way.    Cats are easy because they don't require a lot of attention and when they want you, they come to you for their needs; otherwise they are more independent.  They can stay home and use a litter pan and don't require a sitter when you have to be away for a day.      I love both dogs and cats and have had both.  I have a boxer from Adopt a rescue Boxer group and he is wonderful; never barks, is very laid back, very affectionate and loves everyone.  I prefer a larger breed dog over a smaller one.  (I work in different homes every day and see that the smaller breeds seem to have problems being housebroken.  I don't know why but that is a fact and a very important determining factor for me personally in which breed that I choose to own.  I could not have a dog who can't be housebroken; just not something I would consider.  Hope this helps.        Names for a Jack Russell:    Scooter  Vespa (Italian Scooter!)  Colby  Kobi  Jordi  Calvin  Brogan      Things you need for a dog:    License  Rabies vaccination  Microchip (so if he gets lost he will be returned)  Frontline (so he won't get fleas or ticks)  Heartguard  (so he won't get heartworm which can cause him to be extremely ill and to die; very important!!)    Dry food  Water bowl  Food bowl  Dog treats  Dog bed  Leash (retractable and regular)  Doggie pads for accidents when he is being trained  Dog bed  Dog collar  Nail clippers for dogs  Dog shampoo  Doggie coat or jacket  Toys and chew bone      Cat supplies:    Rabies vaccine  Flea collar (when he is old enough)  Cat license  Collar with a bell (if you want)  Cat bed  Litter pan with litter and scoop (line it with a plastic bag to make changing easier) (plastic bags big enough to fit in the pan.  Scratching post  Catnip toys  Brush  Hairball medication  cat treats  Feather toy on a stick    . . . and for both; lots of love and affection to give to them for the rest of their lives!!

Just like some doctors some vets think surgery is the only way.    Also, what are you feeding him?  Who is shampooing him and what do they use for shampoo.  All this could be allergies.  He may also be growing cysts as a genetic problem, which having them removed will be a waste of money as they will grow back.  And popping them produces more.    I would check for allergies, put him on a human grade food such as Wellness dog food, fish and potato diet, or Dogswell.  These are great foods.  I would also use BioGroom dog shampoo.  It's the best out there.    It certainly is not an ingrown hair or it would not have come back in multiples after one was popped.  A new vet is in order.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Sammy.    Sometimes cats feel over stimulated and "bite" to tell their purrson that they have had too much petting. It is not being mean, it is just expressing themselves. Also they may have a sensitive area and don't enjoy being touched there. I had an Oriental Shorthair that used to bite my ankles to invite me to play. I was able to stop the behavior with slow redirective action.    Cats are preditors as well, and even though they are tamed and domesticated, instincts remain which can   cause biting behavior in play, as well. This is called play aggression, and cats will lower their ears, swish their tails and their pupils will dilate. It is a throwback to when they were kittens, playing with their litter mates.  So observing your cat's ears, tail and eyes will let you know if this is play behavior as opposed to real aggression. Love bites are common in kittens, and the behavior can carry on into adulthood.    http://en.allexperts.com/q/Cats-1606/cat...    This being said, this is really not acceptable behavior. Cats should not be encouraged to bite or scratch even in affection. Since she has been doing this for a long time, it will take a lot of consistency to get her to stop the behavior. Even though she hasn't broken skin, she might get carried away at some time, and cat bites are very dangerous.    When she does this, gently remove her from your lap or wherever you are petting her, put her on the floor, and toss a toy for her to bite and play with. Keep doing this, and eventually she will connect losing contact with you and her biting you. It is going to take awhile, but persist.    Here are some really good items about play biting and why cats do what they do. I think they will be useful to you.  http://www.xmission.com/~emailbox/whycat...    http://www.2ndchance.info/aggressivecat....

If it is a real bite it would draw blood!|`|xnBnbYBgaa	it depends on her body languauge and the action that caused it. if youre petting her and she rubs her head against you then nips you, its a love bite. but if youre petting her and she just outta the blue reaches back and nips you, shes sayin "ok move on that spots good now". if she just full blown bites and it hurts, then shes just a douche and probably needs to be spayed.

It sounds like you know of yet another betta fish that is being cruelly treated?    Without food, I would say a month or so. They can actually live without water for several days, but they do need food. If they are really hungry they will eat plant matter, but this will not sustain them for long.     In the wild, even in the dry season, they would have mosquito larvae, and blood-worms abundantly available.|`|wnnudNp5aa	I've had Bettas live for more than 4 years, but I've never starved them, or neglected to treat them when they were ill. That's called animal cruelty, and if that's what you're doing, give the poor fish to somebody who will care for it!
8A0j51F0aa	just pour it in while the fish is in there. Thats the best remedy to cure any problem your having in your tank. However read the directions carefully and dont overdose or it will kill your biological filtration.|`|AraBfesHaa	You pour it in the tank with the fish.  What's wrong with the fish?  Are you sure it needs that particular medicine?  Don't overdose it.  Use just as stated on the back.|`|Qhdozm54aa	Melafix is best used in a quarantine tank rather than the main aquarium as it is quite strong and could affect the filter bacteria. Melafix should be added directly to the tank, the correct dosage is stated on the bottle.
Qhdozm54aa	Never move a glass tank while it is full of water, the glass could easily break under the strain and unless you are very strong it would be very difficult to move. Water weighs approximately 1kg per litre, this would mean that a standard 60 litre tank will weigh at least 60kg, not including the weight of the substrate and other decor.    Instead drain the water down into a couple of plastic buckets and move the fish, plants (if you have any) and the decor into these. Then careful lift the tank off the chest of drawers and place it on another flat surface. Once you have finished re-decorating the room simply set the tank back up.|`|yV8fog7Paa	We have moved a fish tank before with fish inside of it which killed off most of our fish before, that is one thing you never do.    Take every fish out of the fish tank and put them in a bucket of water (from the aquarium.) Empty out the rest of the aquarium all or most of the way, try to save as much of the water as you can.     ^^ that's what we did.|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	If it's a 10 gallon or more you'll need to remove at least half of the water. (alot more than half if it's bigger than 10 gallons). If it's a 5 gallon or less you can probably pick it up and move it but I'd still take out some water so it doesnt slosh over the top.    You dont have to undo your whole tank, just get some large buckets and empty most of the water into it (and the fish) ...Leave the gravel and plants where they are. It'll probably be alot easier than you think.
kWwgWSSgaa	Again Blunt Object very succinctly hit the nail of the head.    Definitely yes, *if* you purchased the pup from a responsible breeder.    A standard contract on sale, would have include the term that if at any point during the dog's life the owner could not keep it, the owner was legally bound to hand the dog back to the breeder.     The breeder would not be bound to reimburse the purchase price, unless provision for that was made in the contract.    If the pup was not purchased from a responsible breeder, then the breeder may accept the pup back to sell on, but is under no obligation to. You may want to consider contacting your local breed rescue & handing the pup over to them to place in a responsible home.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Depends on what the contract says.  If the breeder isn't willing to take it back, you can always give it to someone who can care for it.|`|AA10412922	If you bought him from a decent breeder,yes they will take him back.The fact they did not screen your lifestyle,means they may not be such a breeder.Contact breed rescue|`|1i8HiHHeaa	yes, by all means, contact the breeder & ask if you can return the pup to them. they should have the first option.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	If you purchased from a responsible breeder then yes the absolutely will take the puppy back (and you likely signed a contract stating the  puppy was to be returned to them if you could not keep it for any reason).  If on the other-hand you purchased from a BYB you are going to be on your own and the best thing you can to is turn the puppy over to breed rescue along with a donation for its care until it is adopted out.|`|vPde97E2aa	RESPONSIBLE breeders will NOT let a pup go that young *&* will have a contract DEMANDING the animal be returned-at any age,for any reason!!  You bought from a BYB CROOK!  Take it back today.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I'm pretty sure your breeder will accept the puppy back.  But don't expect to get your money back unless their is a contract that says you can, and I doubt that very much.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	You'd have to ask the breeder.  They are under no obligation to take the dog back.  It's your responsibility BEFORE you get a dog to know if you can give the time and effort that is needed in caring for it.    If they are a good breeder you might get lucky - they'd probably be happy to take it back rather than it end up at a shelter or otherwise dumped.  But they sure don't have to take it back just because you've changed you mind.  I wouldn't expect your money back either.  If they take the dog back they are doing you a favour - losing the money would be a good lesson in responsibilty for you.|`|89TgOjXpaa	yes, contact the breeder & ask if you can return the pup to them. they should have the first option if they are a good breeder, maybe they should have screened you more closely why would you have got this puppy as you know you would have been working those hours  and everybody know puppies need lot of attention and stimulation  don't ever get another puppy you are a very stupid person|`|oHKpy4IRaa	why did you buy it if you were gunna give it back?!?!?!?!  well, the breeder will except it but if your a cool person you will give it to me!!!!!! cuz i'm used to that stuff your dog needs cuz thats how my dog is. i reeally don't think it needs alot of attention but it does need some attention you shouldnt even have a dog if you work that long.  just give the dog a chance as he gets oldr you will happy you got him and he will be your best friend|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	they should do if its a decent breeder...   This is sad poor pup - 8 weeks old and already unwanted :(|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Something tells me you got this puppy from a back yard breeder.  An ethical, registered breeder would have asked you a heap of questions about your lifestyle and what care you would provide for the pup.    Knowing you don't have anyone to care for the pup during the day plus the fact that you have no experience with dogs a good breeder would not have sold you one of their puppies.    A registered breeder probably would take the puppy back and refund your money, less advertising and all other reasonable costs.. after they were able to find another home for the puppy. I doubt you have much chance of a byb taking the pup back and no chance at all of a refund.  Why did you get a puppy when you know darn well that you have no ability to take proper care of it?|`|N83Po9PZaa	You guys are crazy, blaming the breeder for 'not asking enough questions'  Even if a breeder 'screens' a new owner, the new owner can make their place sound like heaven and give all the right answers.    Most breeders would want first option. It depends on a lot of factors if they'll take the dog back or not. They could very well have someone else who wanted a puppy, but the breeder didn't have enough. All kinds of possibilities. You could always run an add in the paper and resell the puppy, you know. Take on the responsibility you want the first owner to take care of for you (the second owner)      Don't mean to sound harsh. It's just a good idea to have a plan B, C, & D if the breeder won't (or can't) take care of the puppy for you.    Another option is to give the puppy more time with you. Are you sure it won't work out?|`|86d3fa5e8ea3caa23a01700c8f24522daa	I would work on solutions to keep your puppy if this is the *real* reason you are looking to give it up.  All pets want attention and Dalmatians are very playful and affectionate.  Otherwise, you would not have wanted a dog.    You knew when you got the puppy that while not needing the amount of attention of a newborn infant, a baby requires more attention until they get over a year old.   They need to eat more often, poop and pee more often, be housebroken, learn manners,  walk on a lead,  learn sit, stay, and down,  go to obedience classes, and be socialized.      So you knew you would have to be responsible.  What happens when you become a parent and can't care for a kid?  Toss it?    Think on ideas to keep your baby.  Can you arrange a large, SAFE play area where he will not be stolen ?    Is  he protected from the weather?   Is the yard too big for a pup his size?  How about buying an exercise pen and clip the sides so they can't cave in.   How about setting it up in a garage, laundry room, or bathroom?   Buy "end roll" paper -very cheap- from a city newspaper to rip off and put down on the floor.   Buy lots of safe toys the pup can't chew up and swallow.  Buy a large water pan he can't turn over.   Get up at least 45 minutes early to feed early and then play & exercise him,  and let him out to potty.  Set things up so it is safe before you leave for work.    Before you leave, give 2 "Whole Meals" chewy food bones to tide  him over until you get home.  A pup at 8 weeks needs 4 meals a day.  Take him out immediately to potty.  Feed and play & exercise until tired.   While he plays,  Clean up the poop, and spray the area he stays in.  His evening meal should be at least 2 hours before bedtime so he can exercise, poop, and be tired for your bedtime.   He may get ou up about 2 - 3 a.m,  but keep the house quiet, let him out to do business and have him expect to go back to bed or be scolded at the scruff of his neck and a water spray bottle.   Then get up at 6 to feed and wear him out for about 1 hour before you leave.   Hopefully, you will learn to enjoy it.       It takes a while for a puppy to learn things and the roughest time is the first month.   You need to be CONSISTENT however.  By the time he is 3 - 4 months, he will have a good routine and as each month goes by he won't have to go to the bathroom as much.      Can you get someone to go over to feed and play with him even once a day?  Can a family member or friend keep  him during the day?   Can you afford a Dog Day Care until he gets bigger ?   What about a responsible, dog owning high school teenager that will take $5  to walk, feed, and clean his area up for about 30 minutes?  Call a kennel club or obedience club and see if one of their  retired or non-employed members would care for him for a small charge until you are off work.   They would give lots of needed attention and socialization.     Go to sites like the ASPCA that can help you think of ways to keep your puppy and help with training issues..... which you also expected to go through..    If you bought from a reputable breeder, you will have a contract that tells you if you can return the puppy.  You will also  have registration papers, a pedigree, health record from a veterinarian, and the results of his hearing test called a BAER.   Is the breeder someone you would even want the puppy to go back to?    If you MUST sell your pup,  go to the new owner's home to make sure they have a fenced yard and someone is home to care for the pup.   Make sure they have a veterinarian - get their name & call the vet for reference,  and  require that when the pup is mature he will be neutered.  You don't need to make his situation worse!    A good thing would be to do a internet search for a good "Dalmatian rescue"  Find the one closest to you and contact them.  They will be thrilled to help you either with tips on keeping the puppy or will arrange transportation to pick the puppy up..      A good rescue will have a web site, an Adoption Contract, do a home check before adopting out a dog, will take a dog back if the home does not work out, and have a list  of Dalmatians on PetFinder.com for adoption.     Or contact my friends in Dalmatian rescue,  Stacy at Home Again Rescue in Alabama  www.homeagainrescue.com  or Beth of the Colorado Dal Rescue  www.dalmatianrescue.org  For lots of help!    One other thing..... Dalmatians have a urinary system much like humans in that some can produce urinary crystals and bladder stones.  These can block a urinary tract cause severe problems requiring surgery or the dog will die.      Your vet should know this; but just in case give him/her the below information and tell them you refuse to neuter until the dog is mature.   Some vets don't know about Dalmatians or don't care so it is up to you to do the best thing for your dog!!!    If you have a female, you will have to keep her locked up for her heat cycle which can come as early as 6 months...... so be watching fo

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Make sure your fences are secure and exercise your dog more. A tired dog is a good dog.  Walk him twice a day and if you have a dog friendly off leash park, let him run or chase a ball...providing he has good recall.    If he keeps getting out you may have a bigger problem than the fines,  there's a good chance he could get hit by a car.|`|hoeN5xP0aa	When a dog isn't spayed or neutered it does urge them to roam. I suggest getting him neutered asap, and make sure there are no holes in your fence!|`|N83Po9PZaa	Run some hot wire along the top and bottom of the fence. It's a lot cheaper than paying fines, you can turn it off and on, you could probably put it up in a day. There are different voltages you can buy, so you wouldn't need something strong enough to keep a bull in, but one shock is all it'll take. He'll have the best manners around the fence. Also works great to keep other critters out.  Good luck.|`|ard3L0hHaa	He may not consider the new house his home.  Some animals will even return to their former house after a move.  Don't leave the dog loose in the backyard alone until he has settled in more.|`|b1TjlYODaa	I guess some activities might help. Labs are very playful and energetic. They really need mental and physical stimulation. Here are some,  http://elfurl.com/k9ot8|`|gwUMipsUaa	You need to supervise a dog when they are outside.  Only have the dog outside when you can be out there with it.      Also, be sure this dog is getting plenty of exercise and socializes with other dogs, like at a dog park every day.
FbSV4x7faa	I Had a hamster and my brothers hamster passed so i got him a new one and we thought it was a girl but it was a boy and they mated!!!It was gross but my female hamster hung out in her little house and her booty was red!But the signs to look for our:  1-Sweat or water on the sides of the cage  2-Flies in the cage(mine had flies in the cage it was gross)  3-Red booty  4-Hiding in cage...   Theres probably some more other signs to look for but these are the most common    If she has babies these are some things to get for the cage...  1-Some salt blocks will help because the hamsters are attracted to the sweat and saltiness  on the babies and sadly theyll eat them(Theyre Cheap)  2-Dont clean the cage no matter how nasty they are because shell try and it her babies are become offensive(etc.)  3-Get the dad out of there or he will eat them now!!!!The salt blocks will NOT help for him    Thats all i can think of so far but make sure to get the dad  out!!!!    Hope  i helped!!!!    DONT TAKE HER HOUSE AWAY AND DONT TOUCH THEM FOR 2 WEEKS OR SO!!!!!|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	it proubly is take it to a vet if she is pregnet there is nothing you can do deary|`|TD5DKXT2aa	Hi :)    It sounds like she is because you said she has a swell around her bum bum. That is her tummy with the babies inside. Yes i would indeed take the house away it could be dangerous when having the babies. If you do not fell like she is preggy then take her to the vets they can find out Straight away for you :)    Good luck  ?Hamster lover?|`|CVrLmjebaa	I don't think so. Just keep ur hamster in a dark place or it will eat it's babies. My hamster did. And I was so sad. Just do what I said. Good Luck with new babies!|`|pDPSaL37aa	First of all, I hope you have homes lined up for these new babies. Hamsters usually have large litters and the babies need to be separated from the mother, as well as each other after about 5 weeks or else they'll start fighting and maybe even inbreeding. You should have never kept a male and female in the same cage in the first place. Make sure you take the male out of her cage immediately. If she is in fact pregnant, there's a possibility he will kill the babies once they are born or stress the mother out so much that she will kill them. Leave the house in her cage. She probably feels comfortable and safe in there. She should be somewhere dark and quiet to give birth and the porcelain house is probably perfect. Once the babies are born, do not touch them until they are about 2 weeks old. If you touch them before that age, the mother may feel threatened by your scent and kill them. Make sure you start giving her fresh fruits and vegetables and have clean water and food for her at all times.
vS1Z0inOaa	No you do not.     In fact, unless your house gets cold at night (below 70 degrees), you do not need any heat source at all during the night. They need, not only a period of no light, but also a cooler period to sleep. When the sun sets, both the source of light and heat is gone and the turtles settle down to sleep.     Your daytime lights should be on 14 to 16 hours though. We want your indoors "sun" to be up as long as the sun in nature is up during the peak of summer. Depending on your area, that's likely 14 to 16 hours. That more closely matches how it is where they come from :) You would only want to shorten it to 12 hours or so if you were planning to hibernate them as that is one of their signals to slow down for the winter.|`|jRNexOtWaa	that wuold be good|`|b97IpZBOaa	yes|`|ld2vmypNaa	no...leave their heat lamp on for basking and even put it on  a timer for 8 to 10 hrs a day. I have my lamp onmy pond turtles in fall and winter from 8 to 10 hrs cause the sun is not hitting the pond good enough.    Gotta have a heater at 80 degrees always.      http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...
1ymlVLxSaa	I have two baby bunnies at the moment recently rescued from a shelter and both are kept in my house - in my living room in fact as was my previous bunny who sadly is no longer with us.    Rabbits are very sociable creatures and shouldn't be left locked away at the bottom of a garden in a tiny hutch,    My bunnies have a hutch at the back of the living room and then they have about a quarter of the living room fenced off (wall to wall) with a flexible puppy play pen thing.  When I'm in, they're allowed to wander freely around the living room but right now they're too young to be trusted to have that freedom when I'm out!!    Someone has commented that keeping them indoors in unhygienic,  This is completely untrue.  Despite being only 13 weeks mine are litter trained and only occasionally poop outside their litter trays.  They do not smell and they keep themselves very very clean.  Rabbits make excellent house pets and I would recommend anyone considering getting a bunny, think seriously about keeping it indoors.|`|3Yn5Y03Xaa	in the garage|`|fqP6u6YDaa	Definitely outside. They crap all over the place it's really unhygienic.|`|JoAfcy4Caa	Inside in the winter and outside in the summer :D|`|aGwjf2y4aa	they are outside animals and cope better in winter than they do in summer i have 4 and they live outdoors they get out twice a day 2/4 hrs more in the summer!! i have hutch huggers over their cage from pets at home to keep them cosy in the winter my rabbits love the snow and are always jumping around|`|1bRRODd2aa	I used to own rabbits, several, they were always homed outside. The hutches in a wind proof, sheltered position.    Rabbits have very thick winter coats, and as long as they keep dry they keep plenty warm enough.    In summer, the hutches need to be kept in the shade, a north facing wall is perfect.    They need to be allowed to run on and eat grass when the weather allows it, so a large run is essential; in hot or wet weather the run should have decent shelter from sun/rain.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	outside in the shed in large hutches with lots of straw,plus there covered up at nite with thick covers|`|BYWcFlveaa	you can get indoor, toilet trained ones, but really supposed to be in it natural Habitat outside|`|aTzcqC4Naa	inside october - march time  outside other times|`|BxgjOzzraa	i had a rabbit for years, lived in the garden, had a small hutch and a rum, but no wire on the floor so it dug a big hole and lived down there instead. eventually we started opening the door during the day and closing it during the night, the rabbbit woruld runa round the garden during the day, and then go back to it's hole. you have to give them a bit of freedom, they are territorial and will always come back. as for taking them in in the winter. rabbits have lived wild in the uk for hundreds of years, and my rabbit loved the snow. it'll be fine. let it eat plenty of grass and plants, don't worry about poisoning it. if you give it something poisonous it won't eat it, they have a fantastic sense of smell..|`|oAMDkwtHaa	Well it depends if you can keep itinside keep it inside  if it is out side there is a chance a catcould get into the cage look up in petcare books  housing rabbitsor type it into google   GOOD LUCK|`|H3h96s0Yaa	Outside because they can make you house/flat smell no matter how clean they are! =]|`|Yqhx03CNaa	keep it inside so you can know what's going on 24/7|`|Hwybmzg5aa	outside|`|O6r6Zqsuaa	Inside  in a hutch at night all the rest of the time they are aloud to run around the house.|`|po75JU8iaa	Not outsidee but my mum won't let her inside  soo, in my shed or garage :)  Warm and dry|`|UOrZ4or4aa	Outside during all spring and summer  Shed during autumn.

I also had a friend that kept them inside.     Personally I think that they will lead a more healthy and natural life if they are kept outside :) (At least my rabbits lived very long :) - compared to my friend's - her rabbits actually died of overweight..)|`|4JHF4KVOaa	I used to have two rabbits but sadly they died of old ages but i kept mine in my shed in the summer my dad would take off the bottom part of the door an he put a mesh cage up so nothing could get them and in winter he put the door back on to keep them warmer   its also good to let them run about ur whole garden mines were out for at least 8 hours everyday even though the shed was open for them if he wanted to go in. eventually my dog kept them safe from cats and things and both my rabbit started acting like dogs coming in the pation door and sittin in my dogs bed and my dog started acting like a rabbit eating their food and carrots:)|`|1Kxt6M9paa	i keep my rabbits outside throughout the seasons, and they both have a healthy lifestyle.

O6r6Zqsuaa	All of the above, it needs to be a reasonable price, your pet needs to be happy ans safe, it needs to be big enough for the animal and the material depends on the animal.|`|uP8ufTGjaa	Get a big, strong hutch made from solid, thick wood. It should have very solid mesh (preferably the thick black fox proof mesh) to keep out other animals. The material must also be safe for rabbits as they will nibble and chew through it. If buying from a pet shop or feed store, get the biggest hutch you can.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Welfare of pet - which includes size and material. Price should not be an issue - if you can't afford proper housing you shouldn't get the pet!    Obviously the rabbits welfare should be the number 1 priority. To ensure good welfare the hutch must be large enough - at least 2x6x2 feet bare minimum, preferably larger, and preferably with a secure run attached.   Material is particularly important if the hutch is to be used outside. Many commercial hutches are made of thin ply, which offers no protection from bad. Some have flimsy mesh, which is easily broken into by predators. A hutch should therefore be made of decent timber with strong, rigid mesh, properly insulated.  The problem with wood however is that it absorbs urine, making it difficult to clean and impossible to disinfect. I would prefer to get a hutch with a floor lined with a waterproof material, such as plastic. If this were not possible I would add this in myself.    Can I ask a question back? What is with all these hutch questions?|`|H3h96s0Yaa	I would say all of them to be honest welfare of pet would be the main =]|`|BxgjOzzraa	bigger the better. rabbits need lots of exercise. let it out in the garden too, once it's used to living there.|`|aGwjf2y4aa	the size get the biggest hutch u can so ur rabbit will be happy and have lots of room to excercise that will come from the question welfare of pet!!!|`|1bRRODd2aa	The size of the hutch is most important. The bigger the better.  The hutch should also be strong enough to withstand predators (foxes).    It should also be off the ground, either on legs or propped up on bricks/breeze blocks.    If your rabbit is not tame enough to free range, then you also need to get yourself a reasonably large run.|`|W5GYvyyxaa	Material its made of. It needs to be very well insulated as the nights are so cold.this answere includes the welfare of the pet..The hutch should be two story and acsess to the grass|`|1ymlVLxSaa	Always the welfare of the pet however obviously budget plays a big part.  It also depends on whether the rabbit is to be kept indoors or outdoors.    If indoors then I would say the material is irrelevant, and so is the size (if the rabbit is allowed to be free range).    My hutch indoors is quite big however the bunnies can play underneath as its on legs and they also have a big space in the living room to run around in.  I never close the hutch up and mainly my bunnies sleep out of the hutch on blankets therefore size has never been a big deal for me.    Size and material become mega important if you choose to home your bunny outside.  If this is the case I'd suggest shopping around to get the biggest, sturdiest and most weather proof hutch your budget will allow.
qeOlkRM0aa	To be honest, the pet stores by me don't have very good ones any more.. They tend to be small and overpriced. If you look online, you can find bigger and better cages. Of course, it helps if you know what you are looking for.|`|fOc6PB2Oaa	I didn't.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	TBH i think it would be much better to go buy one from a pet store and get it delivered so u can check it out in person otherwise check out argos.

SZOMVGBRaa	1 Gallon is too small for a dwarf frog sorry to say. Also the lucky bamboo is not an aquatic plant and over time will rot and soil the water. I know they sell it as an aquatic plant but its not, trust me.     Go with the Java fern and ghost shrimp. Only get one java fern, they will grow well and 1 gallon is SO small.    Good Luck|`|yV8fog7Paa	neither of them are good.  african dwarf frogs at the minimum need 2.5gal each, so that's 5gal total or more.|`|GqTSa85daa	Setup 2:  -4 Java Fern plants  -2 African Dwarf frogs    I've always believed simplicity is better, maintenance free the best.|`|dw32oKIoaa	Setup 1:   -1 Lucky Bamboo plant  -3 Java Fern plants  -3 Ghost Shrimp    i choose this because shrimps are soo cute!!! and i love them so much!|`|Qhdozm54aa	As Mickey P said 1 gallon is far too small for a frog and the bamboo plant will become a pile of green mush within a week or two. I would just recommend the plant with a couple of shrimps.|`|vvJBtxXHaa	I like the apperance of the bamboo tower surrounded by java fern and the lucky ghost shrimp plying about below in  1..my choice is  1....stack up a few rocks and place the bamboo on top of the rocks...it does in fact enjoy partial submersion    The frogs and lizards usually need lots more water space for their habitats, but   2is do-able if you like...it will take lots more water changes for the frogs|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Setup 1, for the same reasons Mickey said.
Qhdozm54aa	I assume you mean Malawi cichlids? If so I wouldn't recommend it as Plecs have different water quality requirements to Malawis and will probably be beaten to death. Also you will need a larger tank for the cichlids once they are fully grown.    Remember that Plecs may seem 'fine' in a tank full of Malawi cichlids however fish don't show stress in the same way that humans do. If you want to put the welfare of the fish first then please do not add one to your tank.|`|AraBfesHaa	My son had 2 african ciclids and 2 plecos in the same tank for a long time.  They never bothered each other.  You  just have to make sure the tank is big enough for them all.  You probably need at least a 100-gallon tank for those.|`|X3a0exwOaa	Hmm .. I have seen them together before. I consider plecos to be quite peaceful, although ... Cichlids can be nasty little fellas if the mood strikes them!    I would say you would have better luck if your Africans aren't fully grown. Other wise they might pick on the Pleco a bit .... but he will probs keep out of their way.    Think you will be right ... just keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't get picked on to much.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	im sorry but a pleco will out grow that tank|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	I kept a common pleco in a tank with some Malawi cichlids years ago with no problems.  But in your case, I would say no due to the tank size.|`|8A0j51F0aa	no. Its not an aggressive issue its an issue of ph level. Plecos would tolerate high ph levels at all they prefer acidic levels.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Thumbs down doesnt mean anything when it comes to answering this question as I too have a pair of albino bristlenose along with some Christmas Fulu and Python Islands cichlids and they are fine.  The pair tends to stay on the piece of driftwood provided for them. They are never picked on by the cichlids.  If you are gonna add the common pleco...I would do 1 pleco.  Oh and another thing...I kept 2 pair of mouth brooding zebra obliquiden cichlids in a 10 gallon for a very long time and not only did they live the entire time they were in the tank, the 2 females always spawned on a monthly basis so I would not say you need a bigger tank unless you have aggressive cichlids and not all africans are aggressive.  If you listen to those that go by that ridiculous inch per rule crap, you will never be able to own a nice selection of fish.|`|hFyodb4Daa	It will be fine they have armor plated skin that prevents them from getting to severely hurt but you need s much bigger tank probably 75 gallons but if you don't get the pleco you will still need a 50 gallon for the cichlids

They're very social creatures and need at least one friend to keep them happy)|`|3zwDWO3faa	man, you got some stupid answers...  well, when i was thinking about getting a rat, I got a book and it said they do that when they are either mad, scared, or really happy.|`|g9DWi0DKaa	i have 2 rats and never ur weird lol|`|fEcV1CB7aa	well rats can use their tails mine never wag them but they do curl their tails around me for balance he could have been trying to do that or if you have dogs he might be copying them or he just does some rats do stuff millie will curl herself round my neck like a scarf none of the rest will also if  he's alone get him afroiend lonely rats get depressed
SZOMVGBRaa	You don't need it as long as you change water and gravel vacuum. I have a 30 gallon tank with a regular HOB Marine Land filter with Bio wheel rated for a 55 gallon tank and it works great. The under gravel filter will only trap junk under it over time and cause your Nitrates to rise. Then you will have to take it out and clean under it once every couple weeks resulting in more work. Its a obsolete tool of aquarium filtration really, I wish they would stop selling them already.     Just get a good filter rated for at least twice the size tank and do your 30 % a week water changes and gravel vacuums along with not over feeding and you will be fine. Good Luck|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Undergravel filters don't do a good job, & are really obsolete with the newer filters on the market. A good canister does a great job & easy to use. Rinse out your sponge filters weekly & do your water changes with a gravel vac & you will be fine.
72GOhb9eaa	Maybe you could put the crate in a room on the other side of the house and shut the door. He shouldn't be able to wake you up there. Give him a toy or something to keep him occupied. When he whines, quit giving in and taking him out. Your dog has learned that when he whines at night, you will take him out.|`|vPde97E2aa	Let's see........you been asking this exact same question for WEEKS & REFUSE to ****TRAIN**** the g-d thing......

So, for the sake of all mankind, please don't have children if this is how you're going to react...    He needs to go... PERIOD. Either get some piddle pads or get up and let him out.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	He knows even if you yell at him, you will let him out, so he will continue that behavior.    Try to limit the amount of water and/or food a couple of hours before he goes to bed.|`|hggYZSyQaa	Take him out to do his business before you go to bed,if your mother or father stays up for a little longer than you then tell them to take him out before they go to bed just in case.    If he continues to do this buy him something to do his own business on for example:a mat  or  newspaper.    Hey may not be used to sleeping in a crate because it is uncomfortable for him.Buy him the softest bed you can find,buy some chew toys and leave food out in case he gets hungry while your sleeping in the night.    If this continues take him to the vet for a check-up.

v3dN1sSaaa	well if you want a hamster that is not fast you can get a syrian but they cant live in pairs, russian dwarf cambells are nice and they will live happily in single sex pairs and so will dwarf winter whites, chinese hamsters will live in pairs of the smae sex but i would get a syrian becuase they are really friendly, i have 2 syrians and a chinese hamster (but not together) therer all in seperate cages but i would not egt another chinese hamster as she got out twice as they an squeeze through the bars on the cage, so in my opinion get a syrian and good luck with whatever furry freind you get!|`|HkpMrMepaa	Syrians don't live together well with other hamsters so you'd have to get a seperte cage.

Get two of them.  They are extremely small and need company.  They really do.  Solitary robo's get bored and are much less active than ones living in pairs.

Keeping two males together can be more tricky, as they may fight, but I have had absolutely no problems with my little girls.    If you are worried about cage price, go to walmart and buy a plastic tote, drill some holes in it, and provide your hamsters with lots of bedding and toys to climb on. Robo's are extremely active so the more stuff you have for them to do the better.  I built a bin cage for my robos and they love the extra space they have to burrow under the bedding and run on the wheel.|`|k1vMMcEFaa	hi    i would get a syrian because they are easy to look after they are not fast so thats good     get a diffrent cage though       good luck georgia
52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	Sounds like you already trained her to be more hyper than she is genetically.  She is a terrier and they are known to be hyper, she is also a baby they are also known to be hyper. She needs a lot of excersise to tire her out. As she gets older the hyperness becomes less, but never goes away.     1.  Start feeding her "dog food".  A good brand is "Wellness, Dogswell, Solid Gold."  Remember, puppy formulas until 6 or 7 months old.  What I do is this.  A half cup of dry food, mixed with chicken soup" home made only". Whole Foods soups are great.  Canned or packaged has way to much salt. Watch what happens.  And read the feeding instructions.   A 3 month old puppy needs to eat at least 3 - 4 times a day.  She may be hungry if you are not feeding her right or enough.    2. Stop giving her treats for everything she does.  First it fills her up so she doesn't eat her food, secondly it is not giving her the nutrition she needs.  Would you believe a praise and pat on the head are better than a treat?  Thirdly, check the treats you are giving her.  Most of them come from China and have crap in them.  Don't start a healthy puppy off on crap.  Mother Hubbard has the best natural treats, all made here in the U.S.  They also make the Wellness dog food that is so good for them.    So feed her the food she is supposed to have, exercise and verbal praises and you will start to see a big change in a couple of weeks.|`|vPde97E2aa	Sure..............STOP stuffing it every 4 seconds!  Feed it's proper ration of dry adult feed & STOP reinforcing bad behaviors.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	You have a terrier puppy. Calm is not part of the package.  Start teaching her to sit and have her sit before you give her anything from attention to food to walks.  At first you'll probably have to help her obey. And only give the command one  time, then assist her to obey.  this is the start of having her on an NILIF program and teaching her self-control.    Primarily, be patient!  She's just a baby!|`|hggYZSyQaa	Mine will eat anything too!  When we are eating we have a cage for her(cage is about $60.00).  If you cannot afford the cage simply say "NO!" or if she continues this bad behavior eat your meal either:  .Upstairs       or  .On the sofa or dining table    Turn your back on her and if you continue doing this she will learn that she is doing wrong.
3zwDWO3faa	ooh, glad you got a piggy! theyre one of the best pets you can have :)    Is the water in a dish? some piggies don't know how to drink out of water bottles, so if it's not in a dish, put it in one. If she tips the bowl over, get a water bottle. put her nose near it and squeeze some water out. That's how I taught my 5 piggies to use it, but it still takes a little time to learn.  Also, she might be drinking while you are not watching.   Do the pellets have seeds mixed in? If so, get just plain pellets. Piggies can choke on the seeds. I was getting that kind until i read it's not good for them. They didn't seem to like the seeds much anyway.   Make sure your hay is timothy hay or grass hay. Alfalfa is unheathy except as an occaisonal treat. If you are giving her alfalfa she might like it so much she won't eat her pellets. It's just like kids with ice cream. :)  The others are right, if she has at least 6 or 7 square feet, (which she should anyway,) she should have a companion. Get another female, preferably from the same cage or litter. They may not get along if they ddid not live together. Piggies are social animals and love company.   Good luck with Bailey :)|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Your guinea pig is acting perfectly normal, it is just adjusting to its new surroundings, and you. Just give it a lot of attention by talking gently to it when you are near it. its cage should be plashed in a spot were it can see you all the time.   and do not worry about one being unhappy, i have had many companion pets, a single guinea pig, and they were very happy an very healthy. I did however give them a lot of time every day, hours, so that i replaced their need for any socialization.|`|yV8fog7Paa	you should get one more. I made the mistake of only having one guinea pig. They are much happier with one or more, all rodents are happier that way.    fruits and vegitables, try those. If she is not drinking send her either to the vet or stop by the store and pick up those squirter things. They do good for forcing her to drink. When we had to force our kittens to drink we used old medicine squirter things we had and had my dad hold the kittens and try to open its mouth while we squirted it in then shut it. They got about 2 of those to keep them hydrated (they were small, it all depends on the kind u have)    With our guinea pig before we brought it to the vet we made her force drink with about 1/2 of a squirter (still depending on the size)  ^^|`|uvU5DnHcaa	Give her high water content foods like celery, cucumber, grapes and apple. Check she is not pregnant as most that come from pet shops are.|`|a8bKgLs3aa	First of all Guinea pig should never been alone. They are very social animals and you should for that reason buy more then one. Also try putting an apple in her food since they love apples. They also like grapes and bananas and other veggies and fruit. They need these food to help with the Vitamin c intake that they must have. Just Google How to care for my Guinea pig and you will find out all kinds of answers. I own two so I short of know what I am talking about. They should also have Timothy hay instead of alpha hay. TImothy  hay is better for them because it has less calcium in it.|`|vYEA8IMnaa	i had a gineau pig and you have to introduce them to new food while playing with them. They love fruit like apples, bananas and also cucumber. this will interest them more. dont worry about the hay because it is good for them aswell.
X3a0exwOaa	I would say its your drift wood to ... soak it in boiling water for a few days. They say drift wood can drop ph levels, than can cause spikes in the water chemistry one way or another. Although I have no probs with my drift wood.    Just give it a good soak. And check your water parameters daily to see whats going on.|`|Qhdozm54aa	Does the fungus look like a cobweb? If so it is quite likely that is is a harmless aquatic slime mould. These often come in as spores on driftwood and normally feed on detritus and organic matter (from the wood). You could try removing it manually with a net and to prevent it from recurring I would step up maintenance and always remove uneaten fish food with a net. Placing the wood in some boiling water for a day or two will also help.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Shrimp to cycle a tank? Thats a new one, shrimps have a very minimal bio load so if its even possible it will take months. The fungus on the drift wood is simple to remove. Take it out of the tank, put it is boiling hot water for 30minutes, let it cool and then scrub it off. That should gett rid of all of it.
MfcTIdlraa	This kitty has formed an attachment to you.  You are HER person.  It's perfectly normal behavior for her when she loves someone.    My kitty likes to sit up on the "return" on my desk and reach out for me to pet him.  He'll keep bugging me and purring until I give him my undivided attention.  Kind of interferes with my typing!    Don't you worry about her.  Scratch her back just above the tail, rub her ears and her chest.  She'll be yours forever.|`|3nQfMZj4aa	its normal she trusts you and loves you, she just needs contact with you to feel your emotions they look for that just try patting her and putting her aside a few times.|`|04w6ur39aa	You have no problem. She loves you and you are obviously good to her. Some cats can be very needy. Maybe you should get another cat for her to play with - it would have a good home, I'm sure.|`|B2XkpbZIaa	she sounds lovley!!!!! it's because you might be the first person shes really known and trusts. plus as they develop a little they become very playful!! She just loves you i don't think theres a problem!!!! xxxxx have fun with ur kitten!!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Aww, She sounds fine to me.
JTI2Pmkaaa	Any weigt is okay as long as your rabbit is not too skinny or too fat. If you don't know if it's too fat you can see it on the small bulb on the neck where fat is stored. Is it huge, then your rabbit is too fat. I had a friend who had three rabbits dying of overweight. When they lay down they were wider than they were long. - that's how bad it can get :( - although she really tried to exercise them and give them healthy food... they probably had some kind of illness.     But at the early age there is not much to worry about :) Some rabbits are just larger than others :)|`|qeOlkRM0aa	That would depend on what breed of rabbit it is. Odds are he's fine, unless he's a really big variety and is skinny-otherwise, don't worry. Young rabbits grow fast, and eat alot without getting fat. As a general rule, let a baby rabbit eat as much pellets/hay as it wishes for the first 6 months. Baby bunnies are very resilient.|`|H3h96s0Yaa	nutin wrong with it =]

vvJBtxXHaa	Fin rot is a bacterial infection   The best treatment is to raise the tank temperature to 80 degrees,   Do a partial water change.   Add the antibiotic Melafix for fin rot and white growths or possibly Maracyn ASAP  and remove the filter pads from your water filter  ...the pads will try to absorb the medication  ...once the problem is resolved, then re-install the filter pads    As for salt, some trpopicals are a bit sensitive to excessive salt, like Tetras, however unless the slat is really innundated theat will not create a huge problem....and as your water changes procede after the Melafix, then the salt will be diluted each tme you change some water  ...salt sodium chloride, does in fact helps healing of damaged scales  so I included a nice website that explains salt, really simply    Good Luck with this treatment process...use the Melafix ASAP as directed|`|AraBfesHaa	You don't say what kind of fish you have, but salt is beneficial to most species, but some can't tolerate it, so that's the first thing.  Add that to your question, so we can better answer the question.     It doesn't hurt to add melafix and salt to the same tank, you didn't choose the best of medicines to help it, so I hope it works.  The sooner you treat it, the better chances it has.|`|zaMTz8z5aa	Did you ask the vet or the fish shop people?    What are the symptoms? Do you even know WHAT they are sick with or why you are using either of these products?|`|8A0j51F0aa	Thats a good remedy for fin rot. Melafix works very well. Salt wont do to much but you could try. Only use salt in small doses though because it will turn the water brakish if you add to much. Also there is fish medication at local petstores that can work but i would try melafix first as this usually cures most cases of fin rot. Be careful with salt.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	I don't think the people who responded so far saw your added details note.      You don't say what kind of fish that it is, but no fish should be in a bowl.  I'd guess that this is either a goldfish [which can grow over a foot long and produces a lot of waste] or a betta [which is a tropical fish and needs a heater].  As mentioned above, fin rot is a bacterial infection that's related to water quality.  In a bowl, you don't have room for a good filter, maybe just a small undergravel filter. The small amount of water allows wastes to build up too fast, and these poison your fish.  In something the size of a bowl, you'll need to be doing water changes every 2-3 days, as opposed to 25% of the water once a week if you kept the fish in a 10 gallon tank with a filter.  So even if you cure the fin rot this time, it'll keep coming back because you haven't fixed the overall cause.  The aquarium salt will help, but Melafix is more of something to prevent illnesses, it's not a medication itself.  The main ingredient is tea tree oil.  You need an antibiotic.    And most common aquarium fish like a betta require a heater, although a goldfish is more comfortable if the water is room temperature.  If the water gets too cold for tropical fish, their immune system doesn't works as it should, and infections like fin rot are more common.    So, although it's okay to use aquarium salt and Melafix together, I doubt it's going to solve the problem of why your fish isn't well.    Here's an article written about treating fin rot.  http://www.petfish.net/articles/Bettas/f... -   It was written for bettas, but the inforation is good for any freshwater fish with the condition.  See the sidebar on the right about the *effectiveness* of Melafix and Bettafix.  The main article lists some better medications to use.    But the main thing to prevent it from coming back is to get the fish in a properly sized tank for the kind that it is [you can google the name of the type of fish and minimum tank requirements to find out], with a good filter, and to not overfeed and do at least 25% weekly water changes.  And add a heater if needed.
RloOJ43haa	If he is on 24 hour turnout when you are not there, he is probably exercising some on his own. So, you are probably fine. During your weekend rides during the winter, just be sure to take enough breaks that you don't overtire him when he is not as fit.|`|LeRjrY3Haa	is my grammar getting my grammar being good enough?|`|hUyhLeDWaa	Being lunged 2ce a week No. thats not enough during the week.    But other than that yeah|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	Everyone has problems in the winter, you're not the only one. Currently I've only been able to ride my horse 2 to 3 times a week because of the all the snow we've been getting here and he's only been able to been turned out for a few hours, if that, once a day. Winter really is the pits! :(|`|1bRRODd2aa	As long as you are not competing during the winter, and you are not overfeeding him while he is on light exercise and turnout, then he should be OK.  Just remember to put him onto a fitness regime, trotting and road work, to build up his fitness slowly in the Spring before you start competing or jumping again.|`|ngrjFv72aa	i'd say that you are exercising him enough for the winter since you are not competing him, except i'd ride him one extra time during the week (when you would otherwise be lunging him) in my barn we are eventers and we ride our horses 5-6x a week in the summer and 2-3 times in the winter since we aren't competing and the weather is awful, and i know places that don't ride their horses at all for the winter. yes he will probably get a little out of shape, so be sure to really get him back into it (GRADUALLY) in the spring and summer so you can compete in the fall.unfortunately competing ever month INCLUDING the winter does not really sound like a good idea unless you are keeping up his fitness. but most events are in the fall anyways so.   Hope this helps!|`|DdpvxfkNaa	It depends on which discipline he is in...is he a school horse, eventer, hunter jumper? If he is jumper or eventer he will need a good schedule to keep him fit for you to ride and for shows or not. If he is a school horse its fine maybe one more day to lunge if you could. If he is a horse you have to ride for fun it... should be fine! Hope this helps!!

LjneV7LRaa	Maybe you give into him to much and leave it open so he hasn't gotten used to the crate the way most dogs do.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Close it and ignore the howling.  He'll stop after a while.|`|vPde97E2aa	LMAO........because you've SPOILED IT ROTTEN already!  SHUT the door...teach it SHUDDUP!  Or..live w/a nasty monster for 10-15 years;your choice.|`|LsEyhvOtaa	Close it whether he likes it or not. You are pack leader, remember that!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	If he's going in the crate to sleep and eat and likes his crate I wouldn't bother too much about closing the door.  You could try closing it when you are nearby so he can see you. He might not object if you are there with him.    I have 2 Cavaliers, both like their crates and go in to eat and rest and I never close the crate doors.  If I do have to on a rare occasion they are ok with it.  They don't sleep in their crates at night though, they sleep in my bedroom.  My crates are in the living room/kitchen area.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Most dogs object to having their freedom curtailed. Get him used to it slowly, feed him in the crate & close the door then make him wait a few seconds before letting him out. Never let him out while he's howling, only open the door when he's quiet (even if he's only stopped to draw breath!)|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	close it for about 2 seconds then after he stops build up the time he will get used to it|`|Nfr72DPIaa	Anything would be sad being shut in a cage!  You sound surprised!  Why on earth would you want a dog - to lock it up in a cage!  I suppose you're gonna say, its while you're out etc - try training it!  Locking a dog in a cage isnt teaching it not to do the things we dont like!  I think its awful.|`|3891fcebb566f7370dbbd6418e15f386aa	I know this is hard, but you will need to close the door and ignore it.  While others feel that crating a puppy is cruel, in fact it's the best and safest thing you can do for your puppy. Not only does it keep him out of danger when you can't supervise him but it also makes things much less stressful for him if you need to board him, take him to the groomers or in the event that something awful happens (like a hurricane or you having to be hospitalized) and he has no choice but to be kenneled.  It takes time and patience but eventually your dog will get used to the door being closed. (usually about 4-5 days)  Never use the crate as punishment and don't yell at him to be quiet.  Just simply walk away and let him bark.  Another good idea is to exercise he really well before putting him in the crate.  Good Luck|`|N83Po9PZaa	Shih tzu pups can go on and on for what seems like all night. Crate training is going to serve you and the dog for years. Just ignore it, he's giving his opinion.     You're the boss and you don't agree with him....you're just quieter about it.    Good luck.|`|Ah6hFHA2aa	Yes my Collie puppy tried that.    You must put a stop to it now. He is in charge of what happens around him and the role must change.    Get a Spray bottle and fill it with water. Shut the door of the crate and spray him when he starts to howl.    You won't have anymore trouble after a day or two.    It may sound harsh but you can't let a young puppy decide what does and does not happen.|`|q1b7170caa	You need to ignore the howling and Moonbeam!  You should be able to put him in the crate when you need to - it helps with housetraining as well.|`|89TgOjXpaa	Close it and ignore the howling. He'll stop after a while, he knows that he can control you and you are letting him do that just shut the door and let him scream it out  its best for house training and when he knows he has to go in it, i have a shih tzu too and she hated the create for the first few weeks but now she still doesn't like it but she knows she has to go into it when i say she does!! btw she is almost 14 weeks now and she isn't as bad as she use too,, just put your foot down!
K0uTjeWiaa	I would recommend neither        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|AA10859773	Wellness Core is grainless.  BB isn't, but their Wilderness product doesn't have any of the bad grains.    I haven't compared ingredients line by line, but I think these particular two are about on a par.

Core or Salmon diet.  $$ probably both the same but.  Just remember this, Wellness is "human grade food". Not to many foods out there can make this claim.  Read their labels and guarantee.    I have 3 cats and a dog, all on Wellness.  Their coats look great because of the Omega.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Wellness Core is of higher quality than Blue Buffalo. Wellness Core is an excellent grain-free diet (Blue Buffalo puts out an excellent grain-free diet as well called Blue Wilderness).     Wellness's regular foods are still better than Blue Buffalo's regular foods, though. Blue Buffalo is cheaper. It's a decent food, but definitely not as good as Wellness, so I'd recommend the Wellness.    I'd also recommend getting wet instead of dry.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.    Darksong~|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I don't know if it really was the food, but I had my cats on blue buffalo and one of them ended up getting a UTI.  wellness has advertised that it helps to balance the ph of the urine  to help with urinary problems.  I would go with wellness|`|a29qiNkvaa	I looked at both of those and they are ok! I do agree that it should be grain free! I went with solid gold!

1bRRODd2aa	Birds have totally different reproductive and digestive tracts to any other species.    They don't have a separate vent for waste and reproduction, nor do they have a separate vent for liquid and solid waste.  The Oviduct and the waste tubes both terminate at the same point.    Chickens have a single vent at the rear called the cloaca.|`|rQlzfHqraa	If a bum is a poop opening then it's correct. In birds it is called a vent or cloaca. A cloaca serves as an exit for poop and eggs. It also is pushed on the mate cloaca to cloaca to transfer and receive sperm.|`|pdGLwyJfaa	It comes out of the bum i live on a farm have 10 chickens im not stupid but if you want them to hatch you need a roster|`|6e2191f96a837588ddf197c3f002bc49aa	Its comes out its ears|`|MlZOhEmSaa	it comes out of (as you put it) the chickens lady bits    I dont think a chicken has a womb in its stomach|`|zGjrKTHhaa	I think its like they poop them he he :D|`|wHLfa6Aqaa	THERE BUM!|`|G9fnJHqmaa	The egg comes out the vent.

oAQib10naa	Associate calling them with a reward.  I keep crunchy treats in a container that makes a distinctive sound when I shake it, and they know that the sound means treats and they come running.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	keep them inside, they will be safer, happier and healthier for it.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	I have ONE cat that comes when I call and I consider him to be a miracle kitty.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Your best option is probably to try to get them to associate their name with you providing them a good thing - aka treats.  You call their name when they aren't too far away and then offer a treat if they come to you to get it, this can then be slowly applied as they go further and further away.    This won't always work, as some cats will just not be interested in the whole game.|`|IuYekkPVaa	If they are enjoying themselves outside, they might not be ready to come inside when you call them.   Cats are pretty smart, and are much more inclined to adopt behaviours that benefit them in some way, so rewarding them when they do something you want is the key to persuading them to do what you want.  My two understand the word "dinner" and I sometimes find it more useful to call "dinner" instead of using their names to get them to come inside.  I also feed some strays and they have learned to come running whenever they hear my door keys being jangled because they associate that sound with food.      Only letting your kittens outside on an empty stomach can help ensure that they don't wander too far, as they won't want to miss out on their next meal.  This link has lots of suggestion on ways to cat-proof your garden, which is another way that you can keep them close to home.    http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/in...|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Simple. Stop letting them out.     How about keeping your kittens safely indoors? It'll be much healthier for your kittens to be indoors where they're safe from poisons, loose dogs, other cats, cars, wild animals, malicious people... and so on (the list of dangers is quite long). Indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats and it's very possible to have a happy, well entertained indoor cat. It's also entirely possible to train a cat to walk on a harness/leash for safe outdoor trips. Read more on why indoor is better as well as how to make a safe outdoor enclosure for indoor cats:  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...

(Our "Cat Run")      Darksong~|`|jidM3Qxyaa	The number one thing to remember about cats is that they are not dogs. Dogs are keen to please and cats are keen to be pleased. Cats have a habit of going off and doing their own thing then sauntering back when they need something from you. If you condition your kittens to think that they need your constant love and affection, pats, cuddles, food and play, they will be around a lot more to get it. If you are out at work all day everyday and are a social butterfly on the weekends, your cats will most likely grow bored and seek entertainment outside the home.  Maybe, seeing as they are kittens, but them some exciting cat toys like those scratching posts with cubbys in them. They might have so much fun they forget about the outdoors :)  Good luck.|`|SrSfZJTKaa	If shutting the door makes them come running then do this to trick them. Shut the door, wait till they come meowing then let them in. This is typical kittenish behaviour, they are having fun and don't want to come in rather like naughty children. My cat is an adult, when I want him in I just open the door and call him, he's always there within the minute.|`|B2XkpbZIaa	They will be fine!!!! Cats like to explore!! I think they wan't you to come out and play!!!

Mine does it all the time and he's 3 years old.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	lol  Yes.  They are just making sure it stays marked as theirs!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Yes, it's perfectly normal.  She wants to mark it with her scent.  I have six cats and it's often comical to watch them when I scoop or change the litter boxes.  I'll have at least 2-3 of them hovering around me while I scoop, then they'll all rush to try and be the first one into the clean box.  My youngest cat will actually try to jump in the box and use it while I'm still scooping.|`|hGY08GjRaa	yes..     Most cats do that.. It's annoying, but normal..|`|AA10541863	Yes. My cats do the exact same thing. As soon as I get done cleaning their litter box, they make a mad dash straight for it.|`|xcTqwCxJaa	Yes! My cats are exactly the same and are now 1year (we keep them in at night) Most cats hate to use a litter tray with anything in it so when its clean they are happy. Perhaps its also a way of marking their territory?!|`|B2XkpbZIaa	Lol completly normal cat behavior!!|`|orqloVMNaa	It's normal for my cat. He jumps out of his litter box and runs like a crazy cat all through the house, it is quiet comical to watch.
IuYekkPVaa	As your cat has experience motherhood, it may be a maternal instinct, but it's more likely that she views it as prey and is meowing to let you know how clever she was to have caught a meal for you.    I used to have a spayed female cat that would carry a soft toy around the house and meow.  At first I wondered if it was a maternal instinct, until one day I caught her kicking hell out of it with her back feet, and I understood then that she viewed it as prey.|`|iOI2RT6maa	You got it right on the head there. It's a motherly instince. She meows to tell her kittens she had food for them.    She misses her kittens =[|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Yes, she calling her kittens, even ones that don't exist!  It's the same thing as a female dog turning, and turning before lying down.  She's making a 'nest' for her imaginary puppies.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	No, it's not a motherly instinct.  Male cats will do the same thing when carrying items around the house.  Socks, toys, towels, etc. are the house cat version of prey.  When an outdoor cat catches prey, they will meow in the same manner while carrying it.  It doesn't have anything at all to do with a parental instinct, but rather a predator/prey instinct.|`|bB0qV51Haa	That sounds to me like the "I've got prey" sound. all 3 of our cats do that when they have been "stalking' their toys. They also do it when they find a bug. That's our cue to come running and praise them for being so clever and protecting us from the nasty bugs.|`|VuIrLcfzaa	some cats just like to get vocal when they play or she could be crying for your attention...|`|SyGJSaVKaa	It sounds like your cat is trying to tell you that Timmy has fallen down a well.

Be sure to get your pup when you do, from a responsible breeder or rescue and not from a BYB or pet store (those are all from puppy mills).|`|N83Po9PZaa	Tons of breeds would work, there are 'dog match' tests you can find online that might come in handy.    A lot of breeds in the Toy breeds have been bred for years as buddy's or companions. One of the best dogs my kids ever had was a poodle puppy I bought for myself. She adopted my kids and did everything with them....dug in the sand pile, played chase, hung on the bottom of the rope on my kids rope swing while it was flying in the air. She didn't play bite, or chase them down and rip their clothes, or do stupid stuff like that. She was a great kid dog. She's past now, but I'm looking for another for my kids, it worked so well the first time. You just need to make sure the puppy is one of those 'happy' puppies. Stay away from the terrier breeds, though. They might be too rough.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	West Highland White Terriers are excellent. Small, hardy, good with children as long they are taught not to tug and tease and suit a small house with a garden.    If you don't mind a really small dog, bichon fris are also really good with children as long as again they don't tease it as they are small.    Border Terriers are again good with children, love going for decent walks and are small.    Fox terriers and jack Russells are also great with children as they have loads of energy.    In fact most terriers are great with children as they have heaps of energy and are hardy and can put up with bit of rough and tumble and most are small. There are some like scottish terriers that aren't so suitable for families so check out the breed profiles.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Go to www.akc.org and go to medium sized breeds/ small breeds. Read a lot of info before you buy. What is right for someone else might not be right for you. Make sure the parents are good with kids, as puppies get 90% of their temperment from genetics and 10% from training. It could be a very good breed but if bred wrong, turn out very bad. Shelters are a GREAT place to find dogs. My aunt just got a puppy from the local shelter and hes WONDERFUL with my cousins. Good luck!|`|yLRT2NX5aa	West Whiteland Terrior...or a Corgi!!

I know that none of the frogs in the Everglades are poisonous, but wherever you are from, that might be different.|`|jRNexOtWaa	they wouldn't sell them as pets if they were poisonous|`|xQNpDvBkaa	The African Big-eyed Tree Frog (Leptopelis vermiculatus) is poisonous!     The African Big-eyed Tree Frog (Leptopelis vermiculatus) - found in the African rainforests, this is a medium to large frog ranging from 40 - 85 millimetres in length.    The African Big-eyed Tree Frog has two very different colour phases - one green with black speckles and the other brown.    Some specimens show a transition between both phases and change from the green phase to the brown phase as they mature. Their eyes are very big compared with body size and are golden with brown lines and flecks. It has large toe pads that are used for climbing.

5TCewPYRaa	If you already have them, they should be okay---but you should get a more supportive boot like Sports Medicine Boots for the horse (at LEAST the front legs, but all 4 legs for proper balance and equal support...)    I recommend Professional's Choice SMB Elite (best over-all) or SMB 3 (cheaper...) or Classic Equine Legacy System     try http:///www.westernshop.com|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I can see why you would want skid boots if your horse rocks back hard coming into a barrel, but what I usually see people wearing are the sports medicine boots. This page: http://www.jeffersequine.com/ssc/product...  shows a pretty good selection.|`|kaqDUsI7aa	I wouldn't suggest using skid boots for barrel racing. Normally people use sports medicine boots (these: http://www.horsingaroundsaddlery.co.uk/c... ) and ballistic overreach boots (a.k.a. bell boots).     The whole point of putting boots on your horse when your barrel racing is to support AND protect the legs, skid boots offer protection but they dont support the horse's legs, without proper support horses run the risk of pulling/straining something in their leg when they're taking the turns.    Most people also use bell boots because many horses will overreach and clip their front legs when they're running or turning. Bell boots keep the horses from cutting their front foot and/or pulling the shoes off of their front feet.    Well, I hope I helped. Good luck. :)|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Bell boots, Sport boots, and splint boots are the best for barrel racing.
UMfumO1paa	Rats need not only the companionship from there owner but from one of there own kind. Even spending hours upon hours with them doesnt mean that they wont get lonely. Just think about it this way. How would you feel if you were in a cage all day with no one to talk to or play with. And the fact that they are noctornal means that while your sleeping they are all alone in there cage. You need to get your rat a friend of the same sex so you dont have babies. Two rats are just as expensive to take care of as one rat. You wont spend any more money for 2 than 1. And your rat will be alot happier with a friend which in the end would make them more easy to train. Rats that are kept alone can exibit nuerotic behavior like biting only because they are lonely and acting out. But hope I helped.|`|X1LlP5KPaa	Feeder rats are the exact same thing as pet rats.  Most of the time, they come from the same litters and the "feeders" are the ones that are not pretty colors that would be more likely to be bought as pets.  If it was never handled, then it is probably acting completely wild right now.  Don't worry, there is no set time for how long it takes to tame a rat.  They all have such different personalities that you never know how quickly they might take to people.  Definitely get another rat, preferable an older one and that should calm down yours.    Look up how to properly introduce rats.  You will need another cage (you do have a multi-leveled wire cage, right?).  It doesn't have to be big and fancy, but the new rat will need to be quarantined for two weeks to prevent the spread of illness.  You can look up on any rat site about quarantining.  I suggest you join goosemoose.com so that you will something much more reliable than this site to ask questions on and do as much research as you possibly can.  Rats are not easy pets and need a ton of attention, expensive cages, often vet care, and healthy fresh food (no pet store food).  Good luck.|`|RIVywiykaa	I had just one rat    I spent alot of time with him and he became quite tame.    Your feeder rad is most likely the same as anyother rat. if your worried buy him a friend|`|x4Vd6Tvhaa	if the one you have is a boy that may be a bad ideal. unless you want a litter of baby's lol. also i know you said that your new one is a female but if you ever have 2 males you can let them play together but don't let them be in the same cage. i made that mistake once and well both survived but it was not pretty. try to handle her daily. if she is super skittish you can put something that smells like you (ex: part of a old t-shirt) in her cage to get her used to your smell so she will be more used to you. good luck and enjoy your awesome new friend!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	It isn't hard to make them social. I bought one that was a feeder and the lady at the store told me I would never be able to hold it or let it loose in my house. Yeah, right. Within 3 days I was holding him and he was running all over the bedroom. He turned out to be one of the best ones I've ever had. You just have to be gentle with them. Let it sniff your hand while still in the cage for a day or two. Then slowly start petting it. Then pick it up while it is still in the cage. Each day do something more than you did the day before until it is used to you and comfortable with you.  I will warn you though. Rats that were bred to be feeders have a shorter life span than a normal domestic rat. Mine lived a year and a half, where as my other rats have lived 3-5 years.
yNbGq4viaa	You may need to check with your vet.  Some urinary tract problems can lead to him peeing on things.  Also, it's possible that the people before you had a cat or a dog in the house and he is able to detect the scent of that animal even though you may not be able to.  If the previous tenant's animal was using the carpet as a potty then your cat may feel the need to mark his scent and establish the territory as his.  You may want to consider removing whatever rug he is using or having someone come in to professionally clean the carpets, but make sure they know ahead of time you are having problems with pet odors, etc. so they can be prepared with the correct cleaning items.  Unfortunately, once a cat starts this behavior it is very difficult to get them to stop.  You're right though, that is not something you want to be dealing with when you're pregnant and you definitely have to get the problem under control before your baby is born and starts crawling!|`|kW5HfnRnaa	the cat sounds like she is showing her anger at being stayed in the house.  cats act out big time!!!  my cat peed in front of me a couple of times when i came back from a work trip of 1 week.  Guess she thought mommy left her and to show me she was mad she peed in front of me.  Did the cat do this when was allowed outside?  just show the cat extra love, if needs to be an indoor cat, put some plants in your house, get one of those cat jungle gyms, cat toys to make it feel like the outdoors to her and leave some windows open for sunshine for her.  good luck    http://michelescattraining.blogspot.com/|`|tRkIfBOyaa	It could be that he might have something medically wrong with him.  Have you taken him the vet?|`|v4y0zBnLaa	it could be a very serious medical problem, a minor medical problem, or just a bad habit. My cat did that for a while. But, if you keep one of those potty pads, that animals use sometimes, or a litter box near by where he is pooping or peeing, and if your fast enough, when he is starting to poop or pee, or looks like he is, stick him on the potty pad  or in the litter box. About a week or to of that, he probably will be accustomed to one of those. There. i know it works. Another way is to lock your cat in a small room, like a 1/2 bathroom with a litter box or bathroom pads, in about an hour, they will probably use it.|`|bB0qV51Haa	First the soiled areas need to be cleaned with vinegar to eliminate the smell. A visit to the vet would also be a good idea to rule out medical problems but I'm more inclined to think this is an emotional issue for your cat. It's possible he doesn't like the location of the litter box or even wants a second litter box. If the litter box is in a different room (i.e. it was in the bathroom in the old house and now it's in the laundry room for example) then try putting it in the room it was in in the old house. Sometimes it can take much longer for a cat to adjust to a new house. It could also be that he objects to not going outside but you have to keep him safe from your neighbors, too. You can try an outside enclosure so he gets the fresh air but it would also keep him on your property so your neighbors can't get to him. There are some good ones available on Amazon.com (some are even meant to be used on your porch instead of the yard) used and new or you could have one built easily. As for cleaning it up while pregnant, for your own health and that of your baby I suggest buying a dust mask and some rubber gloves to wear when you do have to clean it up yourself. It's the dust from the feces that causes toxoplasmosis so the dust mask will help prevent that.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	First of all, if he just started this it could be a urinary tract problem. They will not go in the litter box if they are irritated.  Take him to the vet to be sure.  If he is o.k. and I hope he is then do the following: It will help.    Get rid of your current litter box.  It must contain an odor he is picking up on that you don't.  What is clean to you is not necessarily clean to a cat.    Then get "Worlds Best Cat Litter".  This is totally flushable, which is good for you.  It clumps great and just dump it in the toilet.  It is crushed corn.  That's all it is.  Cat's for some reason love it.|`|mS1ODTalaa	i totally get where your neighbors are coming from.  look at how filthy and disgusting your cat as acting inside.  he has transformed your house into a giant toilet.  ON top of that your pregnant.  You better just get rid of the cat or it will steal your babies breath when it is born.  Cats hate to compete with children.  I had a cat and it tried to claw my baby girl so I punched it in the nose and gave it to a crazy cat lady who preferred the social company of mindless creatures than that of human interaction.
J5LPAJAyaa	I volunteer in SPCA, and I heard that many animals are put down each day because their owners do not want them anymore =( Some of them are still relatively healthy but they are put down because they are aggressive to strangers. It's a sad thing, really, but that's the world.    I think all animals want to live on and putting them down is really a last resort. However, there are cases where the animal is really ill and the owner or the vet may suggest putting it down to end its suffering.    I hope that helps a little =)|`|CPxmHjx4aa	any time its better for the animal, to end suffering, when nothing can b done for the animal to cure an injury or illness..  for instance: my 13 yr old had cancer, it got so bad she was in constant pain, had an odor to her and her quality of life was greatly affected..  i decided to let her rest in peace because i knew it was best for her even though i would miss her dearly..|`|ePkiOzPSaa	It's generally unnatural for animals to grow that old and wait to die of "natural causes" in the wild.  When an animal becomes older, it is more prone to disease, predators, or being unable to catch prey.  We are usually extending their lives past their normal spans by keeping them protected as pets, and the last part of their lives can often be filled with pain and misery.  The main advantage to euthanizing a pet would be to end this period of suffering, when we know that they will not be getting any better.|`|zaMTz8z5aa	Well if they are just suffering and there is no chance they will get better then it is kind. When a person gets cancer they suffer too...but they can be told WHY and they can understand what the pain and the horrible treatments are for.    Animals can't do that.|`|7wpJH4mXaa	Ask Sarah Palin|`|H3h96s0Yaa	To take away their suffering and it can be hard to look after a pet that is ill =]|`|2t5qUoQcaa	in the event that the animal is suffering or in pain for anything, and you know that it has little or no chance for long term survival, it should be put down.    think about it. one day when you are lying on your deathbed, would you like to be kept alive by machines, just sitting there, doing nothing, bored out of your mind, head aches, back aches, neck aches. to have a pipe put in you bladder to drain urine because you are to weak to go to the bathroom or even stand up, to know that you are a burdon to those around you.  sometimes people live like this for years.    ore would you like to be put out of your missery without being hurt or wounded and farther, to just simply,painlessly fall asleep, and never wake up.    it is just the right thing to do. we have the power to do what we want in this world, so lets do things it as we would like it to be done to us|`|po75JU8iaa	Kinder if they're in pain  Nothing else we can do therefore instead of them being in pain, give them relief  Some owners may see it as the only way out of financil difficulty - long term illness  Or if the animal is violent or harmful to others    Good Luck :)
fgxajTiBaa	Yorkies and most other small dogs DO NOT handle children well. Just because you know one that does, doesn't mean the entire breed will.    There is no such thing as a hypo allergenic dog. Dogs are not pillows or bedding, they are animals with dander, saliva and urine. If you or one of your family members are allergic to dogs, then don't get a dog!|`|vPde97E2aa	You "know" NOTHING!    ALL dogs shed.  NONE should be subjected to torment by kiddies,especially small breeds .    ***&*** THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS "HYPO-ALLERGENIC" DOGS....ANIMALS OF ANY SPECIES!!!|`|CPxmHjx4aa	theres not really a hypo allergenic dog...its not the hair that people are allergic to, its the pet dander..  yorkies are very good dogs, they do make wonderful family pets..|`|pc7ZjexJaa	There is no such thing as a hypo-allergenic dog  There are dogs with not as much dander    Heak...2 dogs of the same litter can be totally different.

Not because because of the dogs temperment but because small dogs are much more prone to being injured by the children.       Hypoallergenic means low allergy not no allergy.   If someone in your house is allergic to dogs they would need to spend time with the breed to see if it triggered allergies or not.|`|XagPxe7Faa	They are a non-shedding breed, if that is what you mean. Even so, non-shedding dogs can still do a number on your allergies if you are sensitive to dogs.  Even Yorkies.|`|noP5C7tGaa	horible dogs very visous|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	No breed is 'hypo-allergenic', all dogs shed some hair - Shih Tzu, for example, shed only when brushed. Yes Yorkies are similar and have low dander levels.  Dogs are only good with children if the children are good with them, children must know how to act around a dog - especially a smaller, more fragile breed.|`|VuIrLcfzaa	the only hypoallergenic dogs are poodles, american hairless terriers and chinese crested. I wouldn't believe who told you they were good around children... sometimes yorkies can be a bit snappy
rLk2w03gaa	The wound is not swollen and you cannot see the stitches?  Can you feel them?  Some swelling with stitches (sutures) is not bad.  Your dog will lick the area; any time you have an  animal that has a wound, the animal will lick it, if it's a licking animal.  A cow, for example, would not lick antibiotic from behind his ear, wherein a cat would, right?  So, of course your dog is doing a little bit of licking.  If licking was all that horrible, vets would all issue Elizabethan Collars upon discharge from the hospital.  You may have seen these, they are big plastic funnels that fasten around the dogs neck, so the largest part of the the funnel is up by or past their ears.  This device will keep an animal from licking a wound.  But, your vet didn't give you that, because some licking is okay.  The licking may make the wound turn a bit red.  It stimulates the area and makes blood go there.  In most wounds, that's really good for healing.  Too much licking, of course, can dislodge stitches and cause fluid to also build up, which is what swelling (edema) is.    It sounds like you are giving antibiotics as a preventative.  Most vets nowdays do that because they've learned that they can make a lot more money that way.  Usually, they put a 300% mark-up on what they sell, from drugs to flea spray.    Given the details, it's highly unlikely your dog has an infection.    Looking "pushed up and gathered" is normal.  Pink is normal.  Slight oozing is normal, and good, too, because if there was an infection, it would need to drain, so some drainage of body fluid is not a bad thing.  Do try to locate those stitches.   If you can't find them or they appear to be digging into the skin, then take the dog to the vet because it will need something for the swelling, like a cortizone pill.  Don't accept additional antibiotics unless the vet says there is an infection, which there should not be, even if your dog has been sleeping in a dirt pile.  Note, though.  If there is an infection, you should be able to detect the odor of rotting flesh.  Also, the suture site (place where the stitches are) will probably be hot to the touch if there is infection present.  I am not a vet.  I worked for some many, many years ago.|`|1bRRODd2aa	As this is a male, then the missing stitches is not necessarily a problem.  As long as the wound is not infected it should heal fine, the incision wasn't deep (only skin depth), no muscles were involved, so it's a minor wound.    Try to prevent the dog licking the wound, finish the antibiotics, If there is any sign of infection - redness and swelling - then go back to the vet, he may glue the wound closed rather than anaesthetise him again.|`|Oie90iwqaa	Take him to the vet|`|5M5BFB5Caa	If you're unsure it's always best to call your vet.  He may have been licking at the wound while you werent looking which is causing it to be red and the stitches to be possibly missing.  Also, if the stitches are missing and they weren't supposed to come out until next week, there could be more complications with that.  The best bet is to call your vet and see what he/she says and have it looked at.  I know I'd rather catch any problem when it's easy and inexpensive to treat.
vvJBtxXHaa	The source of aquaium water has been addressed on Y!answers several times, please search questions using the words "aquarium water source"  ...you and everyone else will notice quite a few answers to that very subject as well as water conditioner    To the point:  use tap water straight from your kitchen faucet  ..the tap water has essential minerals that are needed by fish and plants alike  ...add dechlorinator...that is all  ...the "starter pack" with water conditioner would be useful if you do, inf act opt to use the most expensive methods of tank water, which includes purchasing distilled water..I do not recommend that  ...personally, I have used a product known as "Prime" for over ten years with excellent success  ...that product can be purchased for less than $4 at Wal-Mart and adds a slime coat to the water as well as dechlorinating the water  ....so the fish enjoy the nice slime coat  ..there are many dechlorinating aquarium products available for you to select from  ...the dechlorinator and tap water are all that you need|`|ndnsUfFYaa	These are both treatments to Tap water. Declorinator is due to the fact that chlorine AKA BLEACH! is present in our tap water and have you ever heard the term "Hard Water" when referring to tap water? The conditioner handles excess chemicals and PH present in tap water. All in all i find them both to be useless if you can spend a couple dollars on going to the store and buying distilled water. I then usually add a very little amount of salt to my fresh water tanks. yes its a proven fact that salt helps fresh water fish.     My FAVORITE PRODUCT which makes my fish extremely healthy and i always add a little after handling fish  http://www.bigalsonline.com/BigAlsUS/ctl...

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    Well aren't you the lucky one that your cat is not spraying and he is two years old. Trust me, he will eventually spray. Some cats mature more slowly. If you  get another cat, he will be more than likely "inspired" to mark his territory and start spraying. Of course I am assuming that you have a "Tom" cat.    Female cats tend not to spray unless they are in heat, or marking a territory when feeling threatened. Cats that urinate in inappropriate areas may have underlying medical problems, as well. Spraying is vertical uriniation, horizontal urination in inappropriate places is called "soiling".    There are many good reasons to neuter cats. In addition to preventing testicular cancer from developing, behavioral problems are reduced.    You can read all about these reasons by visiting:  http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_neu...    Hope this helps,    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Proud kitty servant to two wonderful neutered Oriental Shorthair cats.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Female cats are less likely to spray than males, so if your cat is a female this may explain it.  Neutered males are less likely to spray than unaltered males, so if your cat is neutered this would explain it.  If you have an unaltered male cat, you can be assured that he will begin to spray at some point.  It may be that he hasn't sensed a female in heat yet.  When he does, he'll begin to drive you nuts and will spray to mark his territory.  If you have an unspayed female, she may never spray but will most definitely drive you crazy with heat cycles.  Either way, the best thing to do is have them spayed/neutered.  That way all the negative things that can happen when they aren't altered are eliminated.|`|LjneV7LRaa	Is it male or female?  Is it fixed?  Do you only have one cat?    Male and female can spray but typically males do it more.  Fixed cats generally don't.  If there is only one cat in your home it likely won't. They spray a lot of times to mark their territory and if there is no competition then there is not need to mark.
2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Wellness is far from being a "trendy" food. It is a very good quality food. It is far healthier and has better nutrition then IAMS, Purina and the like.  It is unlikely that the food caused the problem.It is more likely the dog just had an upset stomach...it happens and there is often no real cause. Just because nothing showed on x-ray doesn't mean that he didn't ingest something he shouldn't have...I think I would be looking for a new vet.    Just a note going from low quality food to another low quality food probably wouldn't cause a problem, but switching from low quality to high quality can cause diarrhea, excess gas, etc. It takes time for the dogs system to adjust to the better food and "detox" from the low quality grain laden foods.|`|vPde97E2aa	No,not being a silly "feed nazi" or a sucker for advertising,I sure don't!|`|OxFsslN8aa	I think you are doing the right thing with the food.  Keep him on it & keep an eye on his skin.  Vomiting can be the result of stress, heat, excessive exercise, etc.  Could it be possible that anything else triggered the vomiting?  Could he have eaten something he shouldn't have like paper, sticks, plastic?      Just a note - my golden retriever developed allergies late in his life & after much research I switched his food which proved helpful.  The stress of the itching prior to switching his food impacted his overall health and made for other problems.  I think you are doing the right thing in taking care of this skin problem.  Good luck.|`|AA12083992	I feed Wellness, Innova & Merrick. My dog does great. After doing much (and i do mean a LOT) research on dog foods I would feed nothing but the best brands available. I also learned most vets know very little about dog foods and salesmen "gift" vets to promote their brands. Find a true dog nutritionist to ask about dog foods and nutrition. I would not feed purina to any animal.  BTW, the corn in the purina is probably why your dog was itching so much before. Give the Wellness a chance or try the Merrick. Did you switch your dog gradually? You know, mix a little of the Wellness with the Purina and gradually increase the Wellness? If you switched to quickly that may be what gave him the upset.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Pinnacle, Natural Balance, Halo are a few of the top of the line dog food because they are either Natural or Holistic dog foods.     Also, the itchy, flaky skin was because he had an allergic reaction to the Purina ProPlan. I normally wouldn't go with those type of dog foods like Beneful, Purina, or Pedigree. Since he was vommitting, I would recommend any dog food that says 'For Sensitive Stomachs'     Good luck!
AvAuI1Kqaa	I like it. Very good!    To reduce on the smell though, get a male hamster. The females put of a rank smell when they go in heat (Pheromones and stuff to attract the boys). Also, males are easier to train and handle and seem to tame down faster than females.    But that's my own experience.

I suggest that you should get a rat or a guinea pig instead. Rats are social, they do not bite, and they live a lot longer than hamsters. Also guinea pigs are social too, and good companions and they live long lives. If you do decide to get a pet, get one from a shelter so you can save a life.|`|GenpGk7Daa	I suppose hamsters are okay, but rats are still sweeter, more intelligent and smell better.
Maw2rtKZaa	I tried putting that sticky tack shelf paper on the counters upside down, so the cat jumps up and gets the paper stuck to them.  It was traumatic enough for my cats that they don't jump on the counter anymore.|`|dd1uuMrpaa	Clean up after yourself. He's obviously after the food (it obviously tastes better than dry cat food) put the banana bread on top of the fridge and put the dishes away. He'll have no reason to get on the counter if there's nothing that interests him.|`|kW5HfnRnaa	spraying in the face wont help.  when i did that to my cat she actually liked it and would do things on purpose to get sprayed.  take note not all cats are like that.  try putting foil on the counters.  this way when he jumps up there the sound will scare him off.  or double sided sticky tape.  will be annoying for awhile but in the long run there will be no cat on the counter!     http://michelescattraining.blogspot.com/|`|cYFblmpVaa	it wants to be cooked|`|XB0UpJsLaa	try still spraying him. But also you could buy a roll or two of tin foil :P ...it sounds stupid but try lining your counter with tin foil..a lot of cats hate the noise and feel of it, so he might jump off your counter. This worked for me when my cat wouldn't stop peeing on my bed..but some cats don't care. Also, if ur losing sleep over it, you could get a cat carrier put some water in there at night, and let ur cat out when u get up in the morning...good-luck!|`|WCxzJMnvaa	Try spraying the counter with some lemon juice, vinegar, or something else unpleasant (but not anything harmful). You could also try setting some tape sticky-side up around the counter where he lands when jumping.|`|niMim3jNaa	Okay, try mixing vinegar and water and spraying it on the kitchen counter, that will make him not want to get up there so much. Also, at petsmart, they have this stuff called Apple Bitter, or something like that, and you can spray it on furniture so they don't chew or claw it, but that possibly might serve the same purpose, seeing as how it will keep them away from it. I know this might be nasty on your kitchen counter for a few days or however long it takes him to get the message, but once he thinks its up there, he'll stop jumping up. Also, it doesn't matter how much you feed your pet, if they think they can get more, they will, so it's important to keep any food put up and out of their site after they've had enough. And sometimes the people food we have laying around isn't the best for our pets anyway. Hope this helped, like I said, put something on the counter he doesn't like. Try wiping the whole thing down with heavy vinegar right before bed, it's a hassel, but at least you'll get a good night's sleep. =]|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Honestly, I have to tell you that a determined cat will never be kept off the counters.  Sometimes they do settle down and jump up less as they get older, but if your cat wants to be on the counter he'll get on there no matter what you do to deter him.  At best, you'll get him to a point at which he won't jump up there when you're looking.  When you're not looking he'll just jump up as he pleases.  You can try all the suggested methods, but I think it's a waste of time that adds unnecessary stress for both you and the cat.  Keep food items out of his reach, or inaccessible to him at the very least.  Seal the banana bread (or any other food items) in a Rubbermaid container if you need to leave it on the counter.  Or, get a bread box to keep things like that in.  That way he won't be able to get into it.  If you have dirty dishes, run some water with dish liquid in the sink to cover the dishes.  He won't be interested in them if they're covered in soapy water.  The bonus is that they'll be easier to wash than if the food were to dry on them.  Don't worry about him getting on the counter... just let him be.  Buy some antibacterial wipes or spray and clean the counters before each use.      I gave up on the counter battle years ago and both my cats and I have been much happier since.  I keep food items out of reach and if they jump up when I'm working in the kitchen I pick them up and place them on the floor.  Over time they have learned that they're not welcome on the counters when I'm preparing food and they rarely attempt to jump up while I'm cooking or serving food.  They know they're free to be on the counters any other time.  It seems that the more you try to keep a cat away from an area the more interested they are in going there.  Since my cats know they can be on the counter most any time they want, they really don't spend that much time jumping on them.  If they do it's usually only to use them as a stepping point to get on top of the refrigerator or cabinets to sleep.  It's in a cat's nature to jump and be curious, and it's something that's near impossible to "train" out of them.|`|NCa8bOjSaa	Keep trying what you're doing, but in the meantime if there's anything that can be done to minimize the reasons he has for jumping up, that should help too.  Anything he can eat, put in the fridge or cover it over like you said (use a glass dome on your baked goods, etc, put bread in a bread box).  If you have dirty  dishes, make sure they're clean and kept put away (if kitty jumps up and walks around clean dishes in the dish rack you might as well wash them all over again).    Before you go to bed, put a sheet of tin foil along the edge of the counter.  Cats hate the sound and that should deter him at night when you can't keep an eye on him.    Good luck!|`|K6pv1gJ1aa	Aside from the tin foil idea, you could also try sprinkling pepper over the counter tops for a couple of nights. It will irritate the cat's nose without harming him, and he will quickly decide not to jump up there.

EDIT:  when you go look at the trailer, there is a tag on it that gives the specs of it.  If it's a homemade trailer..stay away!  You can have her go get the specs if she's too far away.  Is it a 2 horse? dressing room?|`|RloOJ43haa	YOU CAN'T SAFELY PULL A HORSE TRAILER WITH A FORD RANGER! You already know this because your truck is having problems. Not only do you need enough towing power, you need to have a long enough wheel base for stability. The Ford Ranger wheel base is about a 108" wheel base, and the minimum for towing a two horse trailer is 114".    Every trailer should have a plate on it that has the curb weight. This is approximate because of equipment that may have been added or removed from the trailer since it was manufactured. The owner's manual should have this as well. If you can't find the plate or the owner's manual, you can take the trailer to a truck scale. If nothing else, you can call up the manufacturer and have them look up the specs for the trailer model that you have.     Many people believe that an aluminum trailer is lighter than a steel trailer. It is correct that aluminum is a lighter metal than steel, however, the trailer manufacturers must use more aluminum to make the structure strong enough. Additionally, the structure beams and the hitch are usually still made of steel even on an aluminum trailer. So the actual weight difference between an aluminum trailer and a steel trailer is not all that much, especially for a two horse. When you get up to a four or more horse sized trailer, then the metal starts to make a real difference in the weight.     Also, not only do you need to take into account the weight of the trailer, but also the weight of your horses and all your gear. Let's say you have a 2600 pound trailer. Then you put two horses in it that weigh 1000 pounds each. Now you are up to 4600 pounds. Now put in a saddle and other tack for each horse, grooming kit, water, feed, hay, and items that you have in the dressing room, especially cabinets. You could exceed 400 pounds there very quick. Now you've exceeded the tow limit for your vehicle. So, now you are driving down the road at 60 plus miles per hour in an overloaded vehicle that is unstable to begin with. This is an accident waiting to happen.     Your tow vehicle is the problem - not the trailer. Here are your options:  You can get a full size truck with towing package which should be able to handle either one of the trailers you are looking at. Your other option would be to get a Brenderup trailer. They are specifically designed to be light in weight and have suspension designed so that they can be pulled with a shorter wheel base vehcile. According to Brenderup, you can pull one of ther trailers with as short a wheel base as 93 inches. They can have dressing rooms.    EDIT - I see that your truck may be bigger than some Rangers, but you still don't seem to know the wheel base for your particular truck. It's worth a check, but I still doubt it will be long enough. Even if it is, you still probably don't have enough towing capacity. Also, many vehicle manufacturers will quote the towing capacity assuming that you have a weight ditribution hitch without actually telling you that you need it. Do you have a weight distribution hitch?     I suggest that you flip flop your priorities and get the truck first.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	It depends on the trailer.  A steel 2 horse would weigh more than 1000, more like 2500-4000, for just a plain jane 2 horse.  A 2 horse aluminum would weigh about 2000-3000. It would just depend if they have trailer mats, wooden floors, aluminum floors, full dividers, partial dividers,  saddle racks, no saddle racks... The same size & style aluminum would weigh 20-35 percent less than a steel.  I take it you are talking a bumper pull? What kind of truck do you have that would only pull 5000? And are you sure you are not talking about the ball hitch weight of 5000  ?  Please let us know what kind of truck you are pulling with, and the name brand of the trailers, we could give you a better idea. I do not know of any two horse steel that would only weigh 1000 pounds.    *** Ok, 5000 would be about right for that truck. In that instance, I would definitly  get an aluminum.  Figure two horses is about 2000 , that leaves 3000  for the trailer, tack, clothes etc. I know some little trucks can have trailer pulling problems when they pull too much. Unless they have a towing package, it is hard on them. The trailer should have a ID plate on it telling you the empty and full weight, I would check that.  Either way, witha small truck, I would do the aluminum. Merhow is a good trailer.|`|AA11570905	A Ford Ranger is not big enough to pull ANY horse trailer.  You need a full size truck.  At least an 8 cylinder F150 for a 2 horse bumper pull.  You are risking severe injury or death to you and your horse by pulling around a trailer with that bitty little truck.  I've seen and heard of lots of trailer wrecks with people pulling horse trailers with such small vehicles.|`|f101IPi1aa	get an aluminum trailer they are way better and you can feel a big difference when your driving. mt trainer had a 5horse trailer that weighted 2500 while the steel 2horse weighed about the same...|`|VmZKZjP1aa	Depends on size of trailer and size and number of horses you are pulling. Sounds like you need a different truck. A ranger is not made to pull a heavy loaded trailer. Nor try to stop one once it get's going (it won't weigh enough). YOU NEED A BIGGER TRUCK!   F250 (at least), or the equivalent of your choice (Chevy, Dodge, etc everyone has a diff pref).     So overall, even if you get a lighter trailer, you still need a truck with a bigger engine to pull but also weighs enough to stop a trailer with horses in it. I promise you it's not safe for you, your horses, or others on the road to pull a trailer with your truck!|`|74HBMPduaa	My steel 2 horse slant goose neck is about 2600 lbs.      Make sure that your truck is properly prepared for hauling.  If you are hooking directly to the bumper, you are asking for trouble!  Make sure there is a proper hitch welded to the frame.  Having a 4x4 does really help with hauling.      You can take your truck and trailer to a highway weigh station to get your trailer weighed.  Most steel two horse trailers will weight at least 2000 pounds.  If you are hauling two 1000 pound horses, you are getting pretty close to the limit on weight, which could be why you are having trouble hauling.
ndnsUfFYaa	 In that size i would NOT suggest combining those two fish. Consider the fish to be separate gangs. If both gangs have their own large area and only interact with each other vary rarely then there are no issues. But if they force them to interact they will fight for space. In this size i would not suggest. If you love fish, jump into a bigger tank that would allow you to have more fun and a larger selection of fish. I started out with guppies and fell in love with fish. I then jumped up BIG TIME to a 45 gallon tank and had a blast designing the scene in which the fish would live. Picking the fish that i thought would naturally live in that environment. Remember fish are not only a fun hobby but are also proven to reduce stress and help people sleep (read:waterfall style filter=calming noise) But if we are restricted to this tank size due to available space then no i would not suggest it.>     Betas fight usually when a fish is ADDED to their tank. Think of it like a single child and all of a sudden half of their room is taken up by a baby. What used to be all theirs is now shared. That's when they become most aggressive. Usually when they are used for entertainment fights (Disgusting that people do that) its usually the beta that is added to the other beta tank that dies.    The problem here is this. Bettas are territorial by heart. They are not mean but they like to call dibs early. How large of a tank are we talking here and with your issue of keeping fish alive whats the filtration?    If you are looking for a companion for the guppy i would get another slow moving non aggressive fish. Plecos are GREAT fish for not only their need to eat all the garbage/waste but they love algae as well. AKA the cleaner fish. If you have gravel on the bottom another fish choice which brings utility+companion would be a small fish within the catfish family (sorry it all depends on what you have available to you) which are known to be cleaners as well. They use their two small tentacles in front to move gravel and eat all the leftovers.    I honestly would suggest taking your water to a local pet store (omg not petsmart btw) and having them test your water. They will ask your tank size and filtration as well. You could most like have a very hearty guppy that is surviving when technically it should not.     My favorite fish store (happy card holder too) http://www.bigalsonline.com/  They provide free testing, free RO Water and Distilled water. These three things are a HUGE help. Remember its better to have a stronger filter for your size tank than a filter struggling. They also have several locations around the US and Canada.    But if its a fish you want to have and need it quick for the friendly lil guppy. I would go with fish that are known as indicator fish AKA under 5 dollars. These are the cheaper fish which i use to test water and make sure nothing arises. Perfect fish to make sure that your tank is ready for more fish of more value.     A VERY hearty fish which can be agressive if its hungry (Feed it consistently) and my favorite fish are Polpyterus. They are dinosaur fish that can almost live everywhere except cold waters and even then do well. Hope this helps!|`|t85b6QMiaa	The ideal temperature for Guppy is 17 to 27 degrees Celsius (62.6 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit). They love a water with pH near Neutral. I've been practicing to give them a little amount of iodine free cooking salt (it is better if you could get sea salt) to make them stay healthy.     Even though a female Betta can get friendly with Guppies, there are still possibilities that they might attack them. This may occur if you have a large female Betta. A younger female Betta is more tolerable with other species though.    It is not a good idea to put a Betta while your Guppy is giving birth. She'll happily sees them as an additional diet. Mind that Betta are specially fast when striking a target. The worst scenario is the whole batch won't survive the process and the mother end up dying being attacked by her friend or due to stress.    And you can see if your Guppy is pregnant or not by observing her big stomach and the existence of black (in some cases brown) pregnancy spot.    Good luck.    I'm sorry but after reading some answer, I'd like to share a little bit information based on my experience. Pleco may seem to be a good cleaner but they can also eat small sized fish. They are not entirely herbivore. The birchir are supposed to be kept with larger, robust cichlids or as solitary specimen. Even though you keep feeding it, they will never pass on the opportunity to take small fish as additional diet. My fully grown male Betta splendens have been swallowed within seconds in front of my own eyes. I still regret it till today for not making a research on their true diet and behaviour.    I am really sorry but I really means no offense.|`|ThZLKNkvaa	i'm pretty sure it'll be ok. female bettas(actuallly ALL bettas)can be with other fish as long as the other fish aren't aggresive. the females arent aggresive the males are. but males can still be with non aggresive fish.|`|0qT7iZ3Oaa	Absoultely not... The Beta WILL attack your guppy.|`|Yqhx03CNaa	probably it depends how many gallons are in your tank? if it is a 35 gallon tank it is o.k. But if it is a 4to5 gallon tank it is not a good idea|`|8A0j51F0aa	yes females are non aggressive towards other fish. Ive done it before with success. you can never keep males with them but females is ok.|`|yV8fog7Paa	most likely not. Even though the betta is a female, it's still a betta and still a siamese fighting fish.|`|VuIrLcfzaa	It should be fine. My betta lives with 3 gold fish and 2 kori cats and has been for years. As long as it's not another betta they enjoy company.|`|N83Po9PZaa	I've had betta's and guppies together before. The only prob was the guppies liked to nibble on my betta's fins.
SZOMVGBRaa	African Dwarf frogs would be the only ones. African clawed frogs get too big and will eat all the fish you just listed. Those are the only two fully aquatic frogs I know of.    Here's a link for both.     Clawed http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Frog,%20Claw...    Dwarf http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Frog,%20Dwar...|`|Qhdozm54aa	It would certainly be possible however you will have problems with the fish out-competing the frogs for food. To counteract this I would use a pipette to feed the frogs individually.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yeah it's good make sure it's a african dwarf frog|`|yV8fog7Paa	yes, as long as the frog can not fit in any of the fishes mouths it is good. African Dwarf Frogs or African Clawed Frogs are 100% aquatic frogsd.

lyhnHhuWaa	It may be that she's had a heat cycle and you didn't realize it.  If she hasn't, it won't be long.  No, she doesn't need to be around a male cat to have a heat cycle.  I'm not sure why people still say it's a good idea to let them have a heat cycle before spaying them.  This is absolutely, without a doubt, a false statement.  It's actually better if they're spayed before they have a heat cycle.  Ideally, they should be spayed at about 4 months of age.  Even one heat cycle exposes her to risk of pyometra, a potentially lethal uterine infection that most often occurs at the end of a heat cycle.  Her chances of acquiring mammary cancer will also be increased with each heat cycle.  Early spaying eliminates the risk of pyometra and significantly reduces the risk for mammary cancer.  Spaying also eliminates the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer.  It makes no sense whatsoever to wait for a cat to have a heat cycle or have a litter of kittens.  This is a very old fashioned thought process and following it serves absolutely no health benefit for the cat.      I can appreciate that you're fond of your family vet of 20 years but, if I were you I would go ahead and schedule an appointment with the fill-in vet to have her spayed this week.  Spay surgery is a pretty straight forward procedure that most vets have performed hundreds, if not thousands, of times.  It would be pretty difficult for the fill-in vet to mess it up.  Most can probably come close to doing it blindfolded.  Personally, I wouldn't wait another month.  It'll be best for her if you go ahead and do it now.|`|qnMx8lZzaa	I have had rumpy manx cats in the past. There is a very real danger of spinabifida in manxes too closely related that have offspring. If the vet says she is ready you should trust the vet. You certainly do not want her interbreeding with her relatives by any means. We had a male manx that bred with a related female manx at the adjacent farm. All but one of the kittens were extremely small and died within a week. The surviving female kitten was born with a spinal deformity that led to an early death.  I have read this before about manx cats not being talkative. I have to disagree. We have had several male manx cats that were so vocal and intelligent that we believe they could vocalize to us their preference for foods and even vocalized different distress information.   I have never had a cat that was so trainable as a manx. Our house manx would even go in and out at our command and would leave out room at night at our command. He was also good at interpreting signals to remain at a distance if we were engaged in work that we did not want disturbed.  I think you should work at teaching your cat to talk. We really had a well established language we used. Just start by using different cat language for soft or dry food. Use different cat language for going out or for leaving you alone. Sort of blend cat language and the names of things and I think you may be amazed that the cat will quickly learn.  I was always amazed at how intellectual these cats were.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	That concept of allowing a cat to come into heat once prior to spay is very old information, and without merit!  In fact, spaying prior to their first heat is best, as it just about totally eliminates their chances of getting mammary cancer.  Each passing heat cycle increases this risk, as well as the risk of pyometria.   Some cats are silent when in heat - yours may be one.      Many breeds mature slowly, and come into heat later, but unless it's a cat being saved for breeding there are too many benefits to an early spay to delay it.  Make her appointment for as soon as you can, and you'll have a healthier cat for it.|`|4aAhEK9daa	I HIGHLY doubt your cat is a Manx.  If it has a short tail then it's because of inbreeding.  Short, missing or malformed tails is VERY common in feral cats.  And since you got her from a farm odds are they don't bother to spay and neuter their cats so there's LOTS of inbreeding going on.  She actually might even be sterile from being so inbred.    Who told you a cat has to wait until it goes into heat to spay it?  That's ridiculous - and completely WRONG.  This cat could have been spayed as early as EIGHT WEEKS OLD as long as it was two pounds in weight and healthy.    NO she does not have to come into heat.   Spaying cats prolongs their life regardless of what breed - or in your cat's case, lack of breed - they are.  Get it done AS SOON AS POSSIBLE and keep this cat INDOORS and away from other cats until you do.  I highly doubt there's no other vets around - especially in a farm community.
hKVOw1Sjaa	You cannot legally attend an Obedience school or class until the pup has had its final shot at 16 weeks which is very important so usually Start around the 16 week period but you can practice at hoe unless you do not know what to do.If he is 20 weeks old and fully inoculated including kennel cough you can enrol him ASAP but check all the Obedience clubs in your area some are better than others and know what they are doing.You do not need a trainer all you need is how t use the check chain and have full control of your puppy|`|tyvFUPOxaa	The minute I got them, I started to train them and they trained me about themselves. I am close to 60 years old, so I have owned several friends--not dogs. Dogs can become your best friend; you just need to begin to teach them immediately while you learn your dog, too.  Your friend will have a personality as unique as your personality is unique. House training will require you to teach the dog when to go and for you to be availabe for the dog.     Members of my family have had our friends (dogs) to live from 18 to over 23 years old. Your friend can provide your household with some security with a bark or without hesitating to come between you and an enemy--the most useless dog will do not hesitate to die for you. So, ask yourself first, "How committed am I to having a dog?"    If you have the space, the place, and the time for a dog: treat yourself to a real friend; if not, don't make both of your lives miserable.|`|lgaztlh8aa	Today.

Puppy training actually starts with the basics of potty training.|`|bDsIgFoXaa	As soon as you get him. dogs need training when there young or they will be very difficult to live with.

Kinda like my ex-wife's brother, they are short, slobber a lot, and they smell--and I couldn't teach him anything.    I recommend a Heinz variety mutt from the city pound: they have better personalities, they are friskier, they can train well, and they do not waddle like my ex-brother-in-law.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    Did it occur to you that your cat may be trying to communicate with you that something is wrong?  Cats don't vomit to "get back" at their owners, they do so because something is upsetting their system.    To stop your cat from puking, you have to know what is causing it.  Cats can develop allergies to foods that they have been eating with no problem, which will cause vomiting. Cats can develop hairballs from grooming themselves and if the hairballs cannot pass through the lower digestive tract, they will barf them up.   Sometimes cats eat too quickly, and will toss their cookies almost immediately after eating. If your cat is throwing up hours after eating, something else is the source of the problem.    Most importantly, if you are tired of cleaning it up, poor kitty is probably just as tired of feeling poorly.  My suggestion is to arrange a vet visit to get to the bottom of what is causing the vomiting, and discuss the possible reasons with a professional who can diagnose this correctly.    http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/vomiti...    Hope this helps. The article above addresses this problem in great detail.

Does she every eat things she's not suppose to like string etc.? These can get caught in there intestines and cause a blockage which will cause them to vomit a lot and might need surgery. Is she a long hair cat? Maybe it's just hair balls. It could be that you tracked something contagious from outside in or have you been around any other cats where you could have brought something home? There's lots of reasons your cat could be vomiting. If it continues through the day I would take her to the vet since small animals can easily become dehydrated...|`|UNFxjNHkaa	maybe you should consider taking her to the vet.

Check around and see if your cat has gotten into anything like a roach bait or anything poisonous. It is probably just a stomach upset but if she is retching continuously you will have to take her to the vet. Check out the poisons though...even a plant she might have taken a bite out of. Many indoor plants are very poisonous. Also in future get her some grass. You can grow some in a pot and leave it near her food bowl or in the laundry or somewhere she can get at it now and then. If it isnt poison it could just be that she has a hairball and has to get rid of it. the grass will help with this too but if it hasnt stopped get her to the vet.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	Has calling the Vet entered your little mind.  First of all Friskies is such crappy food.  It comes from china and they could care less what they put in it.    Call the Vet and change to Wellness cat food.

The Rope Eels are a relative of Bichirs and can get over 24"!! Needs again, at least 75-100g.    The two of those will happily eat smaller Gouramis.    The Kissing Gourami will get over 12" and needs at least a 55-65g or larger, and will bully the two smaller Gouramis.    The Rubberlip Pleco is fine in a well filtered 35g, the Honey Gourami is fine, but can easily get bullied by the larger Blue Gourami.    If you added Tetras and Guppies, they'd soon get munched by the Bichir and Ropefish.    Your tank stocking WON'T work, rethink this plan.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	FAIL.....|`|Qhdozm54aa	I agree with Mickey P, you will have big problems with such an odd combination of fish and the eels will probably eat the smaller fish once they are fully grown (depending on the species). The blue gourami and the ropefish will also need a fairly large tank.    Rubbernose plecs (Chaetostoma sp.) ideally need to be kept in a species tank in my experience. These fish originate from fast-flowing streams and rivers that have a high level of dissolved oxygen (DO). In a normal tropical tank at higher temperatures the oxygen level in the water will be fairly low as the warmer the water is, the less oxygen it is able to hold.|`|QikvnTnqaa	Different gourami's don't always get along. It's like putting a mastiff and a poodle together. There are always exceptions, but I wouldn't put them all together. Gourami are fairly aggressive fish.     I don't know much of anything about eels, how big do they get? I know gourami's get to be about 6 inches long. Any they grown fast! I have two.    Don't buy your algea eaters yet, your tank needs time to build up algea or they could die unless you buy algea tablets.    If your eels get big enough that you think thy could swallow a dime or a nickle, don't buy any tetras or guppies.  They could get eaten.      I have a comunity tank(now smaller due to a bad case of ick) with 2 blue gourami,one tetra (will be getting more), two swordtails (beautiful fish-will be getting more also), about 7 guppies, only one adult (rest are fairly large "fry"), and a chinese algea eater that's only about an inch long. And my fish do great. I will need a bigger tank for my gourami soon though. They grow awful fast.|`|LNH3ZbsCaa	I totally agree with Catx.  That's the best answer here so far. Your tank will be well overstocked. People should research before they get fish to find out how big a tank they need, how big the fish will grow to and whether or not it can be put with other fish especially if they'll eat the others.  Some fish are best kept in same species only with some of 1 male - 2 female ratio depending on what kind of fish and size of tank you have.    I researched for a month before even getting my dwarf puffers.  I'm afraid there's alot more to keeping fish than just putting them in a tank, especially if you want them to survive.|`|nr9mD871aa	Oh god no! The dinasour eels get quite large, pink kissing gourami get up to 8 inches. Rope eels get pretty big. Plecos can grow up to 2 feet long! Do more research before you do anything!

eiim3tJuaa	http://www.monkeyzone.com/regulati.htm  TEXAS    The Task Force is currently conducting a very extensive county-by-county survey of the State of Texas. Of 253 counties surveyed, 198 responses have been received by the surveyors, Linda Brent and Amy Kessel. 91.4% of the responding counties had no regulations regarding ownership of nonhuman primates. Only for 7 counties and 3 cities do the regulations specifically mention "monkeys", "apes", "primates", or "nonhuman primates." Appendix B3 provides several examples of responses. The state requires a permit for certain species of animals (apes being the only primates on that list) - unless one has a USDA license. There are known to be many pet primate owners in the State of Texas and there are a large number of baby monkeys sold at exotic auctions.    http://www.petmonkeyinfo.org/laws.htm  STATES WHICH BANS CERTAIN NONHUMAN PRIMATE SPECIES AND REQUIRE PERMITS FOR OTHERS: Florida, Texas        Do NOT get one as a pet. They don't make good pets.  http://www.primatestore.com/monkeywant.a...  http://www.petmonkeyinfo.org/testimonial...  http://www.petmonkeyinfo.org/articles.ht...  http://www.tdscats.com/pet_monkey.htm  http://primatesanctuary.tripod.com/boonh...  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...    You probably don't need to have any training to buy a pet monkey. However, imo, you should get some training & education. You shouldn't get a pet dog without knowing how to care for it, knowing what medical problems a breed may have, how to or where to train your dog, etc. And you want a monkey as a pet, a WILD animal.    You should learn how to care for it, learn about how it behaves in the wild (for example, monkey social structures - with one type of primate, if you get a male you may be fighting each other for dominance, but if you get a female you two would get along better. And social structures may affect the way your monkey interacts with other people; your female may attack someone she thinks is threatening you.), where are you going to take it for medical care, how big does the cage/enclosure need to be, what kinds of behavioral enrichment are you going to give it, how do you train it, how should you behave/act in certain situations, etc?      If you really care about monkeys, I'd suggest that you instead, work with them at a zoo, sanctuary, or help train them. I hope the links below will help.    Try to get into Moorpark's Exotic Animal Training and Management (EATM) Program. You will get to care for and train primates. You'll learn about their nutrition needs, primate behavior, diseases, etc. The program might even be able to help you find a place to work with them.  http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_s...  http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_s...  http://students.vcccd.edu/cats/08-09/mc_...

They are incredibly expensive, require more care than a human infant, and can be very destructive.      So basically it doesn't matter, there is no way you will ever get one.  Find something realistic, like a hamster.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Dont be stupid. Monkeys bite, scream, slap and hit, ALWAYS. ALL mature monkeys do this. They also pee and poo on their hands then rub it on your to scent you. You cant keep them in the house, they will end up killing themselves messing with cables and knives, they also need UV so need a secure outdoor enclosure. They carry viruses that can kill you, and a common cold virus will kill THEM. They cannot be toilet trained and will poo everywhere, if you take the diaper route they will need at least 5 diaper changes in a day, EVERY day, for up to 50 years (this is how long monkeys can live)  They are ripped from their mothers at a few weeks of age so you can have a cute baby hand-reared monkey, when they would naturally live together with their mother for up to years, depending on the species. Some monkeys are caught in the wild, the mothers are shot and then the baby monkey is stolen, stuffed in a crate with no water, food or ventilation crammed in with other monkeys, and transported half way round the world, up to half of them dying before they reach their destination. Why should such cruelty take place just to supply a selfish, spoiled child with a cute, adorable pet monkey?    So, as a 10 year old , how exactly are you planning on financing this monkey? Lets break it down shall we:    Monkey: Around $1000  Enclosure: Up to $10'000  Food: They eat as varied a diet as humans, so are almost as expensive to feed, because they waste a  lot of food.  Vet fees: Up to thousands annually. You need a certified exotic vet who will treat your monkey, they are EXPENSIVE and you will need to do a lot of travelling.    It takes YEARS of research that you probably couldnt even read properly yet, only being 10, before people are even ready to THINK about buying a monkey. Even then, most people make a big mistake and ending up dumping their monkeys on Monkey World or other charities. Dont be like them.    And yes, in most places they are banned, or you will need a license.|`|gvGjrGheaa	Monkeys are not horrible, however they DO  need the care of a responsible, ADULT keeper. They almost always show aggression as adults, most monkey keepers who deny this are just saying that because they dont want monkeys banned as pets. A child is in no way strong or capable enough to care for a monkey, and you wont be able to afford it, unless you parents are rich and willing to lavish money on you. Also, some things to point out from that site you posted:    Primates need 24 hours attention daily: How are you going to provide this? Dont you go to school?    Marmosets cost $1500, capuchins 8000,  squirrels, 5000. Do you have this sort of money? This is in addition to the caging, feed and vets fees you will need.     They are a lifetime commitment. At 10 you are too young to know what you want with your life, and thus too young to make that sort of commitment.        At the end of the day though, in Texas you need a permit, and if you think a permit is going to be granted to a 10 year old child, think again.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	First of all I am not familiar with c temps but in F the temps should be 100-105 degrees. If they temps are not up they will not eat as well and are not able to digest their food. Do you have a UVB light on them?  This is a must. Do you have them both together? If yes, one could be stressing the other out by becoming the more dominate one thus the other won't eat. What are you feeding them? They should be getting all the crickets that they can eat at this stage as well as a fresh salad mix everyday made up of several types of greens such as collard, turnip, mustard or dandelion greens topped with finely grated veggies as butternut or acorn squash, peas, green beans, parsnips and the list goes on.  If you have them together I would try to separate them. Also do you see them drink water? If not try a nice warm soak in the sink as they might be dehydrated. Also misting daily will help will keeping them hydrated. You know they could also have parasites which only a vet visit will determine this. Good luck but check those temps.|`|N7YjfsBAaa	take it to the vet, this happened to my brother's bearded dragon, it is now dead. So if I were you I'd get it checked out pretty quickly..|`|JiUKeyhGaa	well u should check ur uvb lighting and also ur beardie may be stressed so stop holding it so much|`|EX1GjjJCaa	It probably has a spastic colon.

ErSbeRlzaa	If the cats were in their garden then no. If the dog does get out and does hurt your cat than you have a strong case to get the medical fees. Either way the owner shouldn't let the dog out in the first place and you should talk sense into him/her to prevent it and stop you worrying.|`|AA10356572	if your cat enters their yard.. I actually believe they could sue you... (the owners I mean)    however if their dog enters your property and hurts your cat (you would have to prove where the attack happened) then you can sue them - usually for vet costs..    so..  your best off to keep your cats in or build them a safe cat section.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Why don't you contact the SPCA, they will be able to talk to your neighbours and advise them of their legal responsibilities where their dogs are concerned.

The length of the coat has absolutely nothing to do with behavior. It has to do with the way that the dog is bred, raised, trained and socialized. I used to breed Short Coat Chihuahuas. I now own  15 Spayed, Neutered and Microchipped Short Coats. Mine were all trained and socialized around a lot of adults and children when they were very, very young and not once have I had any behavior or aggression problems with any of my Chihuahuas. They are all very well behaved and very friendly to everyone they meet. The only difference between the two coats, is that Long Coats require a little more grooming, that's it. I think both Short Coats and Long Coats are cute. It just depends on what the person prefers. I prefer and think Short Coats are cuter.  R.I.P.

Oie90iwqaa	Once the dog starts "running" or twitching, he's in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) cycle, which is extremely deep sleep and when tests have shown there is the most brain activity.|`|0lnamekJaa	That is just a dream...    If you think he looks funny... Get a camera and film yourself while you sleep... You do the same thing...|`|vPde97E2aa	sigh........DREAMING!  duh|`|m4uDn0ofaa	Yep!  Perfectly normal, he is just having himself a wonderful dream!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	yes- very normal|`|h6JJNgoKaa	Yes it is.  I am unsure of the facts here but have been told that they are dreaming, just like us humans.  I had one dog,(a boxer) who used to bark while dreaming and a boston  terrier who would stand up move, bark and then lay down again.  So yes it is normal for them to twitch and move while sleeping.  It shows that the dog is contented and fully relaxed|`|NXwzuv3Paa	yes. hes dreaming.|`|Ixny0YFIaa	yes|`|HXQCpuFWaa	yes it is normal.. my girlfriends dog done that when he was sleeping  she said get that rabbit|`|Ab8rje0Faa	Yes it is, its like when we sleep, we twitch as our muscles are relaxing and is exactly the same for a dog.

bFzu835Aaa	They may, regardless of if you get a peachface or find another Black Masked you're going to have to start slow. All species of lovebirds can technically live together, but they have to like each other for it to work. A separate cage at first, slowly moving them closer, having supervised play time OUT of the cage (lovebirds can be extremely territorial, just putting 2 together can end in a blood bath) before trying a new neutral cage together is needed.     Gender doesn't really matter, 2 females/males can like and live together just as well as a male/female pair. If you don't know what sex your lovebird is for sure (DNA test- black masked and Peach faces are not sexually dimorphic, you CANT tell them apart based on looks, behavior or anything other than DNA or if you have one that lays an egg) getting a friend can be tricky, you might end up with a pair that turns super broody, or not. You never know without knowing the sexes.|`|Ayn7tpXKaa	First of all, please don't listen to the person named "Ben Dover" who's the second to reply to this question, he's an internet troll who has no viable reliable information.    If you're seeking another companion for your lovebird, I'd suggest, if possible, bringing her to the breeder or pet store and seeing how the two will interact.    Oftentimes, 2 females will fight, even to the death.  Mind you, this is usually only with another male in the cage.    If you can't see if they'll get along before you buy one, it's advisable to get another small cage and introduce them slowly.  Sometimes, for whatever hierarchical bird reason that's beyond my comprehension, they just don't get along.  You might end up with 2 separate cages.  It's like that in my house, but at the same time I think that they like to have each other's company, even if it's not in the same cage.    Good luck!|`|zaMTz8z5aa	Put thrm in cages near each other first so they get used to one another and it might work.|`|JDyGZJ0daa	no, they will viciously attack each other. peach faced lovebirds usually bite each other and will "beat the black off" of the black faced lovebird.   it's a bad idea. just take my advice.   but however, black faced lovebirds do enjoy the company of purple faced lovebirds. the have plum colored babies.|`|AA11174528	You can. Go for the opposite sex though because lovebirds of the same sex will fight alot. Put their cages beside eachother (unless you're like me...impatient, stick 'em together but under strict supervision. I don't recommend my way).
lgaztlh8aa	Vet Wrap.You can wrap the paws cheaply...booties are expensive.  It's the elasticy bandage that sticks to itsself. Youy should be able to order it online. Where are you located?

I have horses and use it all the time on other stuff, i.e drum stick tips for Rock Band, softening the handles of tools...ect.|`|1bRRODd2aa	If you can't use booties (the best option) you could try lightly greasing his paws before he goes out, use Vasceline or other petroleum jelly product.  Wipe the paws off before he gets back inside. The grease will help protect his pads from the ice.    As he's still a baby and a very small dog, try not to walk him when there's only ice/snow on the ground.  See if you can't clear a space under cover somewhere where he can pee/poop without freezing his paws off.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	It maybe not be the snow, but all the salt that is put on the road.    If it is available in your area you can buy Paw Pro.    Keeping the nails trim and scissor the longer hairs on the paws and wiping the paws off after the walk is probably you best solution.

I haven't run into this problem with any of my cats, but if I had, I would have called my vet in a heartbeat. Anything abnormal should always be checked out.|`|rLk2w03gaa	When you wormed your kitten, did you test it for worms before you wormed it?  Not all wormers kill all worms.  In fact, I don't know of any of them that do.    How long have you had your kitten and have you recently changed its feed?  Over-eating/suddenly eating a lot more than one normally would, not just for one meal, but over a period of a couple of days, can cause bloating, which will go down.  How are his stools (poop)?  Do they look dry?  Are they in very small chunks, shorter than his normal size turds?    If you squeeze his tummy a little bit, does he cry and squirm away?  If you can't find any weird symptoms and his tummy is still swollen and hasn't gone down after 2 days, and he is still eating fine and playing fine, then don't worry about it at all.  But, do remember, when your cat doesn't eat or drink for 2 days, it will probably die.  Cat's don't' have the body weight to sustain long illnesses that stop them from eating or drinking.  That's not your problem now, I know.  It's just an FYI as to when to panic!   Congratulations on your new kitten.  And, I'm not a vet.  I just worked for them and know quite a bit of regular stuff about their health care.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	THE VET! CALL THE VET.|`|reTrCl5baa	sounds like worms,  could be a different kind of worm, than what he was treated for.  take him to a vet to be checked.|`|bB0qV51Haa	OK first off, you didn't say HOW bloated his tummy is. You said to look at it you can't tell much. Young kittens often appear to have large bellies but in reality it's quite normal. They spend the majority of their day eating and sleeping because they are growing so fast. You said he doesn't seem to be in pain and that all else is normal. I honestly think there is nothing wrong but if you are worried a call to the vet would help put your mind at ease.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    It is excellent that you have scheduled a vet vist. I would suspect that he may have a blocked anal gland, which is causing him a great deal of discomfort.    http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/analsa...    I have a cat who had a symptom very similar to yours. The area was swollen,and warm to the touch, and he had licked off the fur in that area. Upon a vet's exam, it was determined that he had a blocked anal gland that had become impacted and infected. Simple surgery to unblock the gland, and stretch the gland did the job.     What is tipping me off to this possibility for your kitty is the location of the problem, and his licking the area to the point of losing his fur.    Good luck with your kitty. This is a fairly simple procedure and your cat should do well. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe antibiotics to treat any infection.

You don't know anything about his history meaning to say you could adopt a better cat which is young and has good medical history. Looks like its no way close to be neutered.    Neuter it.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	Go to the vet and don't worry. If he is eating then it is probably nothing and just looks bad because of the licking.  Get to the vet asap just for safety sake.|`|bB0qV51Haa	Does he by any chance go outside? Possibly a tick embedded? It's good he's going to the vet today. Please let us know what you find out afterwards.|`|rLk2w03gaa	Congratulations on adopting an adult cat!  Don't worry about not knowing his medical history.  Would you really not love him anymore if you found out he had a history of allergies???    Sounds like he's licked a subdural hematoma on his rectum.  How close is it?  It could be a hemmoroid, too.  I think it sprang up too fast to be a tumor.    He may have worms. Not likely, but possible.  You did right to make the vet appointment, but this is nothing for you to worry over between now and then.  It certainly doesn't sound life-threatening.  Relax. And, congratulations again.  You did the right thing by adopting him.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	It sounds like a blocked anal gland, which your vet will quickly put to rights.  Normally cats anal glands are fine - the act of defecating empties them, but some cats have occasional issues with them blocking.  It's painful for the cat, which is why he's licking.   The vet may put him on antibiotics if one is infected, or may not.   In the meantime a warm compress may help, but he might not want you to hold the wet towel there - give it a try.  Don't be surprised if it breaks and leaks a rather stinky fluid.  Even if it *does* break, take him in to the vet anyway.  Ask the vet about the odds of it happening again, and what to look for.  Some people learn to "express the anal glands" at home if needed, others prefer to have the vet do it ...     He'll be just fine - and he *has* a health history now - the one with your!
ePkiOzPSaa	I would advise against the melafix, as it can sometimes make things worse.  How severe is the case of finrot?  how big is his tank?  Remember to age your water for a day before using it for a water change.  Do you have a dechlorinator that you are using with the water?    The three biggest things for clearing up fin rot will be -  1) clean water, if it is a small tank (1-3gallons), you will want to be doing a 100% water change every few days, at least twice a week.  2) a medicinal dose of aquarium salt, do NOT use table salt, get aquarium salt for regular marine fish, from a pet store, add a pinch of salt into the new water you will give him, and let it dissolve before doing the change  3) correct temperature!  This is the one many many people get wrong, bettas will rarely thrive, and oftentimes will not survive, at "room temperature", they are tropical fish, and their preferred temperature is somewhere between 75 and 82, with the middle range being the best (78ish), you can get water heaters for small tanks, but try to get an adjustable one if possible, and get a thermometer with a probe that goes into the water and sticks to the outside (much cheaper than they sound)    A healthy environment and a touch of aquarium salt is often the best cure to fin rot.    edit - check out the forums at www.ultimatebettas.com for more info|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Regular tap water is fine as long as its treated. Don't go back to that Pet shop, hes an idiot.      The problem is the melafix, it a natural medicine made from tree sap or something like that. It rarely Works and is not very strong at all. Go and get a real medicine like Maracyn and you will be ok. Good Luck and keep up with your water changes.     http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...|`|AraBfesHaa	I don't know of anyone who has said anything good about melafix.  It didn't work for me, either.  Maracyn or Maracyn 2 will clear it up, just follow directions.  It's the best meds I've ever used and always have some at home, I wouldn't be without it.  It treats a variety of illness, and more than it says on the box. A little pricey, but worth it if you want to save your fish.  Can't get it at Walmart, but Petco and Petsmart both sell it.  Personally I think maracyn2 is better than maracyn but you'll probably get good results with either.  They're both antibiotics, but different types.|`|ndnsUfFYaa	Remember a large cause of deaths when it comes to fish is stress. So if your fish is already in a situation which is bad for him and then the cost water changes (Ph temperature etc etc) worsen the situation. Usually i have what i call a med tank. Usually this med tank is a small tank 1gallon and under (depends on size). I fill the tank with 80% original water and then 20% Reverse Osmosis or Distilled water. Then while adding treatments to the water i usually remove 20-30% water and add again pure RO or Distilled water. This gradual change to healthy water is easier on the fish and works well with filtering as well as clean water coming in. Remember everyone goes back to PET STORES when their fish are sick but neglect they fact that veterinarians are TRAINED to handle fish as well. Contact a local vet and query them on their fish knowledge. Start by asking if they want a picture of the fish or to see the actual fish as well.     Hope everything works out!
hKVOw1Sjaa	There is absolutely no similarity between these two breeds but you have to remember you have to be leader of the pack no natter what size the dog is and Min pins have a mind of their own and can be snappy if not raised correctly.Raise the pup carefully and not quite as strict as the pitt bull but with the emphasis on you are the pack leader not your female,By the way females are easy to house train and get along with most until they come into season which is not  a good time,if you do not want to breed her then de-sex at no later than 5 months that is your choice not mine.Min pins like to sit on laps and are what l call Lounge lizards but they have spunk and can hold their own against most other breeds. l do not care about your spelling but try spell check it may help l am answering your plea for help as best l can so if you need further help e-mail me only willing to help in any way l can so forget the nasty answers you are bound to get so be prepared for them.|`|THJCWCoMaa	female min pins are very stubborn and block headed dogs.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Start the training very young and you should have fewer problems with training than if you wait too long.|`|b1TjlYODaa	There are some training methods that generally apply to all breeds.

Small dogs are much harder to train (generally.)    How trained is your pitbull? House trained? Leash trained? Good with other animals/kids? Does it come when called?     If you can't say yes to those then your pit is not trained and socialized properly and therefore you have a false belief that it was easy to train.

Since thousands are euthanized every year, it is the only humane thing to do to prevent over population of unwanted pets. Owners sometimes are not responsible pet owners and this has to be done. Here is a list of the ordinances by state.    http://www.helpinganimals.com/res_lawspa...|`|VuIrLcfzaa	It's impossible because shelters don't want anymore animals in there in result of negligent owners who let them breed and breed and breed without caring for what happens to there puppies/kittens.|`|SUs4rN49aa	It's important to spay and neuter pets so that there is a decrease in the amount of homeless animals... Lots of people let their animals roam outside and do not get them fixed. When the pet gets pregnant and then has babies, some people might just drop off the babies in the woods or on the side of the road.. most likely to happen to kittens. We domesticated dogs and cats so it is our responsibility now to ensure that pets have a good quality life...not roaming the streets only to repeat the cycle. Pets deserve good homes, so I can understand how shelters make sure that the animal should be spayed or neutered. Not only does this procedure eliminate unwanted pets, it also expands the life of the animal.|`|AA10356572	depends where you live.. I have never heard of this LAW - but know it is the POLICY of some shelters.. others require you get the pet spayed/neutered when its old enough..    the kittens you take and give away..  did you know what happens to most of them?  studies have shown that less than 20 % of "FREE TO GOOD HOME" kittens get good homes - many are sold to research labs or used to train illegal fighting dogs to kill  - or are snake food... just about EVERY serial killer admits they started by killing "free to good home" pets..  I doubt all your kittens are still in the homes you gave them too =- and I doubt further that you ever checked back to see they were    if you worked in a shelter and saw how many kittens are euthanized weekly you would realise YOU are to blame - because for every kitten of yours that found a home - it means a shelter had to kill another kitten
l5kWF8m3aa	Don't spray him with water!     It's normal for a puppy to chew and bite. It's how they get to know their environment.  If a puppy is chewing on something he shouldn't try to distract him with another toy. Don't overwhelm him with too many toys at once, rotate the choice of toys, keeping some put away. That way he won't get bored.    Squeeky toys work well, so do hard rubber toys.     And if he starts to bite you, say the word "Ow" or "Ouch" very loudly. Eventually, he will get the hint. But it takes time, he doesn't know any better.|`|0lcSi5tnaa	a swift kick up the a$$ and he'll remember that for a lifetime!|`|OxFsslN8aa	Exercise, Exercise, Exercise.  After that kennel or gate him in an area safe for him when you are not available to keep a close eye on him.  You can also teach him the "leave it" command.  To start this you have him sit and stay; put a piece of treat in front of him just out of reach & command him to "leave it".  He must sit still & not lung for the treat.  At first make him sit for 5 seconds & then give him another treat (the trick is never to give him the leave it treat).  Extend the length of time he has to wait before getting another treat.  Once he has mastered this command you can tell him to leave whatever he is chewing on (hopefully before he starts chewing it).  Good luck.|`|VTee51r9aa	We have a puppy and she chews on everything no matter what we do. Eventually they will grow out of that stage but in the meantime you just have to  bear with it.|`|Oie90iwqaa	Training and exercise will help. When he is doing something wrong say "NO", "DONT" etc.....in a stern voice but not to scare him. Lots of exercise will also keep him occupied and hopefully by the time he's finished he'll be too tired to chew on your valuables. Keep giving him lots and lots of toys. There are also some safe sprays that are available that deter dogs from chewing. Good Luck!|`|1sHBVWuKaa	You can spray some apple bitter on the items he chews.

It was hella fun.|`|LjneV7LRaa	Give him things he is supposed to chew on.  When at all possible remove the object so the puppy won't be tempted.  And yes, try something that doesn't have a good taste to deter the puppy.

As soon as he puts the new toy in his mouth praise him exhuberantly, and maybe play with him and the new toy. toss it, make it sqeek whatever.\     Timing is everything when you are training animals.

He is very lade back and calm! Except for truck rides then he gets excited and when he see kids! HE loves kids! He will go over and just set is head on there lap until they show him some love! Now my female Maiya can be a hand full! She loves to run!! We take her out and let her run!     I also get the same thing with my dogs when I walk them! I think it because they are such big dogs and people get intimidated my one person walking 2 big dogs! Also think because there are soooooo many that here stuff on the news about these bully breed they make up there minds before even meeting any of the breeds!     I have a girl friend that has 2 Great Danes and gets the same thing and her dogs are the biggest sweethearts!!!    There are several on YA that I see everyday telling people that Akita are aggressive and that also makes me sooo mad! Most of them have never been around or even know an Akita!!     I did not get my dogs until they were 2 years old! I got Sumo at the local pound; I did not know anything about his past! We had to teach him everything from sit to stay and walking on a leash and off a leash! Now Maiya I got from the free ads and she was abused! When I got this poor girl she had been kenneled and chained up all the time. It was below zero out as well when I got her and she was out side with no shelter or bedding! I also notice that she was missing a large patch of hair on her side so I ask and found out that she froze to the ice and there just ripped her off the ice! When we first got her she was aggressive with men and after a year of training and teaching her that men are ok she no long freaks out with men! That shows if you get proper training you can get past anything! It also show its not the dogs it the stupid people out there that think you can take a dog and put in your back yard and do nothing else with it!|`|LjneV7LRaa	I don't have a negative view of akitas AND I have never met someone who does.

Imagine a loving protector who will follow you from room to room, whose entire mission in life seems to be simply to serve you.    The Akita is courageous, a natural guardian of his family. Stubborn and willful, he won't back down from a challenge. He doesn't usually bark unless there is a good reason, but he is vocal, making amusing grunts, moans, and mumbles. Some owners says the Akita mutters under his breath and seems to be talking to himself, while others say the Akita offers his opinion on all matters, from how to load the dishwasher to when the children should be put to bed.

And runs around like crazy as if he's just won a year supply of pet treats.  My female 7 month old puppy is very energetic.      I do have the same issue as you, but in my opinion, people have every right to be afraid of them.  As you know, Akita's can be VERY antisocial dogs, so I would take it as a good thing if people decide to cross over the road when they see my dog.    This is usually when other people are walking their dogs.    I've had a few people come up to me and comment on how beautiful my Akita's were and asked the breed.  I even had one idiot girl try to convince me my Akita was really a Husky. Can you believe!?    I've also had people walk across the road and apologize because they were afraid of how big my dogs were. I can understand, they are massive dogs.      I've walked my dog to a local deli where everyone knows him, tied him up (He's tied up infront of a window so I ALWAYS have a good view to see what's going on around him. That's the only deli I trust to walk him to) and I've had a couple of idiot boys provoke him and call out to their mates to..    "Look at the f*cking SIZE of it! He's f*cking HUGE. Oi man, he could rip you to shreds. Hey.. get that stick"    And I've run out and my dog is on all fours, pulling against the chain because he's wanted to rip the idiots to shreds because they had started provoking him with a stick.    My anger and arrogance made me unclip the lead to see what the boys would do and they all backed off.    Mind you, my Akita will not move an inch if he is commanded to Stay.    However, when commanded to 'Zen' which means, Attack or Go Forth, he will let loose.    I've never had to use that word before, but my cousin has when he 2 unleashed, unsupervised german shepherds decided to verbally attack or bark/growl attack him. The 2 dogs ended up running off when my Akita defended my cousin.    Funny that.. 2 German Shepherds against one Akita..  God, I love Akita's.    I am NOT condoning dog fighting.    Akita's are my life as well. To me, they are the most wonderful dog to have, IF you know how to handle them.|`|Zv7aPjcQaa	I love all dogs. Some people are just crazy!   One of my mixed breeds is the meanest thing in the world, all of my pit bulls are friendly...BUT, when I am walking my sweet and loving pit bulls, they cross the street, but with my mixed breed, many people run up to him and say, "aww, he's so cute!" without even asking if he is nice. HE IS NOT NICE AND HE WILL BITE. I warm them right away, "MAM! he bites!" So, it really doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or feels about your dogs. Keep loving them like you are. When they cross the street, just tell them they don't bite. Some people are just scared of dogs in general, so you never know. Because not everyone knows what an Akita is. Its a dog...who cares about what breed it is?! Try doing what I said and see what happens. Try exciting your dog when people come around. Say things like, "Hey buddy, look at the nice people! yeah, look at the nice people, you love nice people!", in a real nice voice. Also, I tried this once...someone crossed the street, and I crossed over with them (on purpose) and my pit bulls walked by them wagging their tails and the person had no problem. If you cross with them, their not going to cross again (believe me, unless they are real paranoid!). I know it sounds mean, but you have to show them that Akita's are NOT mean! at least not all Akita's. It depends how you raise them and in your case, you are doing a good job.
fWf3A3Ioaa	You really can't house any other birds with finches besides other finches or small wax bills.  And even then, you have to be careful about what species you select because some of them can be mild to extremely aggressive.    This bird will never be tame to allow you to hold it or eat out of your hand, they are simply not "tame" species unless they are specifically hand raised for this purpose (which doesn't happen often).    Your bird doesn't need a nest unless you plan on breeding it, which won't happen unless you get another shaft tail.  Either way - you need to at least get ONE other finch.  Finches are social/flock birds and will not do well if by themselves.    Think of looking at any of the following as a possible companion, and remember, NO HOOK BILLED BIRDS SHOULD EVER BE CAGED WITH FINCHES, PERIOD.    Gouldian Finch  Owl Finch  Waxbills (Strawberry Finch, Swee or St. Helena's Waxbill, Orange Cheek Waxbill, etc)  Spice Finch  Cherry Finch  Society Finch  You could also look at various mannikins or Nuns, and even a canary would be okay.  Just stay away from Weavers, Zebras, Saffrons, and other larger species - they tend to be aggressive.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Well we had heaps of American and Australian Finches and they were all very wild. You can't really feed them out of your hand or let them fly in the house. Here in Australia (Alice Springs mainly) they fly in groups and are like a common pigeon.  This isn't like a parrot which you can really handle, they like to live in their cage without your interference from the experience I've had from owning them for 10 years.|`|M9KUiTOAaa	Finches are social birds and need a flock...they will just not do well on their own..they will be very unhappy and maybe even die of loneliness if just housed alone..you need at least one other finch. A canary is also a bird that can be housed with certain finches.  As far as letting them out to fly around, they are just to hard to catch..you usually have to wait until night and use a net and a flashlight to catch them. They are just to fast and the stress of you chasing them can cause them to have a heart attack.   I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but it is what is best for your precious little bird. He needs at least one other finch in the cage with him..
bB0qV51Haa	First off, I'm sooooo sorry you had to wake up that way. Second, please don't stick his nose in it, it will do more harm than good. Now for some questions.    1 Do the 2 cats get along well? If not, the older one might be keeping the new one from using the box. Cats are territorial about their toilets and if the new one feels threatened in any way he won't use it.    2 Is there just one litter box in the house? If so, try buying a second one and pu tit in a different room. Some cats just don't like to share.   3 Has the cat been to see a vet to rule out a urinary tract infection? If not, you might want to look into that. If the new cat is eating a different food from what it's used to that could be a cause of altered toilet habits.    4 If all else fails and none of the other things is a cause, then you may need to isolate him for a day or two in a closed room with his food, water, and litter box so he can get the idea.      Wash all your bedding AND pillows in hot water with vinegar to eliminate the smell. Cats can smell things more easily than we can and if he even gets a faint whiff of urine he may do it in the same place again. A lot of times peeing in inappropriate places is a sign of emotional distress when medical reasons have been ruled out. Watch him closely for any signs of fear of the older cat or anything else that might be upsetting him. Good luck and I hope he gets straightened out soon.|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	The rule of thumb in a multi cat household is one litterbox per cat, plus one just because. Have the kitten in to the vet for a urinalysis. You said you talked to the vet on the phone about UTI, but did you take the cat in to be checked?   I also agree that the older cat may be keeping the younger cat from using the box.    Edit:  I would ask your vet to check the urine anyway. Just because he is urinating only on certain things doesn't mean he DOESN'T have a UTI. It doesn't cost that much to check. If the vet refuses, I would find another vet. I can't tell you how many times I saw pets that had the obvious overlooked. The owners were at their wit's end and finally came to the Internal Medicine Specialist I worked with. It may not be a UTI, it could be a problem with the kidneys. Many times bacteria will NOT show up in a urinalysis if the infection is in the kidneys. I have even seen a urine culture come back negative for bacteria, but there was indeed an infection in the kidneys.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Other people have given good advice about possible health problems, problems with the other cat, not telling him off, etc, but a few suggestions to add:    'Clean' to you may smell like overmarked/fading mark to him and encourage him to use the same place again.  Washing with biological washing powder, dry, then damp down with surgical spirit will remove all the smell to his nose.    I've heard of some people using puppy training pads with cats with success: I think the idea is you start off in the place he goes, then gradually move to the tray, then gradually put more litter on top.    Since he messes himself, is it possible he's doing it in his sleep?  If so I think it's time for a trip back to the vet, though if he is incontinent in his sleep I don't know if anything can be done.    And I'm sure paper based bedding for small animals would be fine if you can't find paper-based litter, though I guess a bit messy to clean.  Apparently cats favour fine grained clumping litters usually, so you might try that first if you haven't.|`|a1dee089009df4acd57a32a73d6dd2d2aa	My cat had a urinary tract infection and did the same thing.  It would be worth checking with your vet.  If it is a non-medical issue, maybe you could get a crate for the kitten to sleep in near your bed.
AA10029366	I've never had to raise orphaned puppies, but I'd expect they should get as much as they will drink. :) If they were nursing, they'd drink until they were full and tired, and then fall off the nipple.    I will star for others with more experience!    ADD: Found this --  "How Much To Feed:  "...each day the average puppy needs 25-35 milliliters of formula for every 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) of body weight. Divide this number by the number of feedings per day to obtain the amount for each feeding. During week two, give 15-20 ml for every 100 grams body weight. During weeks three and four give 20 ml for every 100 grams body weight. These amounts are always only a rough estimate. Feed the puppy until its belly is gently rounded or pear-shaped."  http://www.2ndchance.info/orphanpuppy.ht...|`|frt7Q8YMaa	how about take it to the vets  vets  vets  vets  vets    how about taking it to the vets  vets  vets    failing that eat it lol|`|0ef3O2m6aa	Hi!  I've hand reared several pups, too numerous to count.    How much to feed is greatly dependant upon weight of the pup.  To do this the most accurately the pup should be weighed daily with feed adjusted.  Puppy should show a steady weight gain. (Buy a digital food scale at Wal Mart for about $20-30) General rule of thumb is 1cc/oz of pup per feeding.  I have had good luck using this method.     I have used several brands and recipes for milk replacer and my favorite is probably Esbilac in the pop can.  Follow the direction, at any rate, as to how much to feed daily and divide that by the number of feeding.    My question to you would be what breed pup are we dealing with?  I feed newborn pups every 2 hrs during the day and every 3 hrs at night until 3 days old, then I go every 3hrs during the day and 4hrs at night.  I am dealing with a toy breed tho.  My pups weigh between 3-7oz at birth.  Usually it is the tiny ones I have to hand feed.  So I feed them 3-4cc every 3-4hrs.  Larger  breeds can eat more less often.      Watch the urine and make sure it is normal colored.  Also pinch or tent the skin on the nape of the neck and see if it bounces back.  If it does it is a good indication the pups fluid levels are good.  But dehydration is definately something you want to be watching for.  So is hypoglycemia, esp in toy breeds.  Signs of hypoglycemia are excessive shakyness.  If this occurs, a bit of Karo syrup rubbed into the gums will usually pull them out of it but if it reoccurs a trip to the vet is warranted to access the pups condition and how you are feeding.     Pup should appear full after feedings NOT bloated.    With all that said, I will say I have not had especially good luck bottle feeding.  They seem to overeat and aspirate some formula causing an aspiration pnemonia.  So watch for this!  Milk should not come out the nose.  Sign the milk is flowing too fast or pup is overfull. I choose to tube feed my babies...much more precise and IF you know how to do it, it is safer.  If bottle feeding is not going well have your vet show you how to do this.     Is mama available to keep babies warm?  This is the other concern with hand reared pups.  Puppies cannot regulate body temp until about 3wks old so that is your job.  My heating box consist of a plastic tote that is twice the size of a heating pad.  Place the heating pad in half and cover with towels and a puppy pad.  Set at LOW ONLY.  Poke holes in the box for vent holes.  Lightly mist the inside walls with a water bottle and that will provide enough humidity to keep the babies airways from becoming too dry.  The pups will move to or away from heat as they need.  I also fill an old shampoo bottle with HOT water and put it in an old sock.  This is warmth they can cuddle up to.  VERY IMPORTANT....NEVER feed a chilled pup!  They should be warm to the touch, pink and squirmy with good muscle tone.      That should give you enough info to get started....if not feel free to email me.  Hand raising puppies can be tricky until you have the experience and know what to watch for. If you have other quest. feel free to email me.

Police said the 17-year-old dog attacked the toddler after she climbed through a hole in the fence of her backyard and into an enclosure with the animal.    The dog's owner turned the pet over to the city and was cooperating with authorities, said Keane Menefee, manager of the city's Animal Care and Control Division.    Menefee told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram the animal's vaccinations were not current, and that the dog will likely be euthanized.      ADD:  The dog was 17 years old at the time of the attack.  This shows that he wasn't naturally aggressive or else it would have made to be so old without this type of thing happening before now.  Not only that, but the girl went not only through a fence.  But into an encloser as well to get to the dog.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	The 3 year old was unattended outside while the parents and a 8 year old were in the house and did not see the attack. The child stuck her arm through the hole into the dogs fenced yard. The parents had not considered the hole a problem because they thought it was too small.  There had never been any problem with the 17 year old dog. Texas has a one bite law     Another tragic case of a child unattended, and a dog protecting its property.|`|KhjpmxGeaa	Police said the 17-year-old dog attacked the toddler after she climbed through a hole in the fence of her backyard and into an enclosure with the animal.

Menefee told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram the animal's vaccinations were not current, and that the dog will likely be euthanized.    The dog was probably just protecting its home knowing how Rottweiler was bred for diffrent things.    Origin of the Rottie :  The Rottweiler is probably descended from the Italian Mastiff. During the Middle Ages, it was used as a herd dog. It was bred in the German town of Rottweil in Wurttemberg. Practically extinct in the 1800's, the breed population began a comeback in the early twentieth century due to the efforts of enthusiastic breeders centered in Stuttgart. Some of the Rottweilers talents include: tracking, herding, watchdogging, guarding, police work, carting, competitive obedience, and schutzhund.    The three year old girl should have not been left alone will with a bigger dog and their should have had not been a hole in the fence so the girl could of have had gotten in their.    Just so you know I did not take this from the first answer.I looked it up on google and I typed in ' Girl attacked and killed by dog in texas".So do not say I did And I Found My Infromation At http://www.dogbreedinfo.com|`|NDFN04sqaa	How did the girl get through the fence?  And where were her parents?  Who leaves a 3 year old unattended?  this is really sad!|`|Ayc9vLIgaa	Yeah, what the heck were the parents doing?  3yr shouldnt be left alone like that.  I would blame the parents more than the dog.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- why are people blaming the parents?  Why was there a hole in the fence?  Clearly it is one of those things that just "happened".  I am sure the parents are beside themselves with grief, so give it a rest.|`|kOrYXVedaa	I'm not sure if that's a rot or not,but this is the only info that i could get:  10/09/06 - KTRK/DICKINSON, TX) - A two-year-old girl was seriously injured in an attack by a pit bull. That little girl is being treated for a punctured lung and other injuries, after being attacked by the dog owned by the girl's aunt.    Around 12:30pm Monday, the little girl was playing outside, while her aunt was babysitting her. The dog, which had been chained, somehow got loose and attacked the girl.    When officers arrived, the dog was sitting on the porch. The animal reportedly lunged at a deputy, who fired a single shot at the dog.    "The lady had left the little girl outside on the front porch and went back inside to feed her baby," said Dickinson Police Chief Ron Morales. "She heard the dog growling and hollering, and she ran outside to see that the dog had the little girl in his mouth. She immediately tried to open the dog's mouth."    The little girl, who is less than a month from her third birthday, is being treated at Memorial Hermann Hospital.    The dog died from the shooting. No charges have been filed as of yet.          Chaining dogs makes them territorial, mean    By Scott E. Williams   The Daily News   Published October 13, 2006    As breeds of dogs go, boxers are not known as ferocious fighters. The nonprofit Web site www.boxer-dog.org describes the breed as energetic, playful, loyal, family-oriented.    Ashley Evans, 2, has evidence to the contrary all over her body.    The toddler was still in a Houston hospital Thursday evening, in stable condition but receiving treatment for bites to her face and arms, police said.    On Monday, the toddler was in her aunts yard in the 3400 block of Ohio in Dickinson when she wandered toward her aunts dog, chained to a tree.    The dog mauled the child and later charged a police officer, who shot the animal. County Animal Control officers later euthanized the dog.    The problem was not the dogs breed, but its confinement, experts say. Animal experts and handlers say dogs chained to fixed objects and left unattended often became aggressive and territorial.    The problem appears twofold. Chained dogs often spend little time around people and other animals, stunting the dogs social development. Also, dogs are territorial by nature, and when their territory shrinks to the circumference of a chain, they defend their areas fiercely.    What a lot of people forget is that dogs are descended from wolves, with an instinct for preying on other animals, said Sgt. Joel Caldwell, animal-cruelty investigator for the Galveston Police Department. If theyre tied up and see other animals running free, it enhances that prey drive. It also frustrates them to have everything out of reach, and when something does come into their areas, they will often pounce right on it.    Dogs that become fierce after being chained do not appear to care what that prey is. In the past three years, chained or tethered dogs committed 103 attacks that hospitalized or killed children, according to reports collected by the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit group Dogs Deserve Better.    Caldwell said about 90 percent of the calls he handled concerning aggressive dogs on the island involved chained animals.    Kim Schoolcraft, director of the Galveston County Animal Control division of the health district, said a dogs nature was to be part of a pack or family.    When a dog is isolated every day, for extended periods, its going to take a psychic toll, just like it would on a human being, Schoolcraft said.    The chains and ties can also leave physical marks, as officials found on a 10-month-old pit bull found wandering in alleys Monday. The dog had developed two things  a bloody divot in its neck from struggling against a tether and a fear of all living creatures. Schoolcraft said that some animals whose psyches suffer from chaining can be rehabilitated.    Unfortunately, shes not going to get that chance, Schoolcraft said of the pit bull.     Because of crowding, the county shelter often has to euthanize animals that are not adopted within 72 hours of their arrival. The pit bull was euthanized Thursday afternoon.    A dozen cities nationwide have outlawed chaining or tethering unattended dogs. Two of those cities  Big Spring and Electra  are in Texas.    Marie Wilson, a Big Spring City Hall records technician who handled animal records when Big Spring passed its law in 2004, said violators had three options.    They can receive a warning, depending on the circumstances, but more likely, theyll be subject to a fine, or they can sign the animal over to us.    Wilson said city leaders passed the law after a rash of complaints about the welfare of dogs left tied to a tree or other fixed object.    The advice our officers give pet owners is usually to create a fenced area for the dog, Wilson said.     Many pet owners took umbrage at the idea of having to fence their entire yards for their dog|`|BWS6kHP5aa	she died  violently to a rottweiler|`|ixutx59Daa	That's what happens when you leave your 3 year old unattended.    That's what happens when you leave your 17 year old rot unsocialized and left as an "outside" dog.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    If this is something recent, your cat could have an upper respiratory infection. He may be having difficulty breathing.     On the other "paw", it could be that your cat is snoring. I have one that is so loud when he is in deep sleep, you can hear him on the other side of the room. He was evaluated by our vet and given a "clean bill" of health. He is not overweight either.    Check out this snoring kitty. Does yours sound like this?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vExoyqi5C...    This being said, there are many reasons for snoring which should be checked out by your vet. Allergies, blocked nasal passages, and other medical conditions can cause this problem.    http://www.snoringbegone.com/cats-snore-...    So to be on the safe side, talk with your vet about this to make sure he is healthy, and that he is  just one of the 7 percent of cats that snore.    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Sleep deprived at times by a snoring kitty.  Freelance writer/blogger for:  http://www.petside.com/the-sidewalk/|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	Yes you should worry.  Sounds like an upper respiratory infection.  Get him to the vet quick.|`|bB0qV51Haa	We have an almost 3 yr old female (who is NOT overweight by the way) who snorts and snores in her sleep. She's been seen numerous times by the vet and they can't find anything wrong with her. The best they could tell us is that she is affected by dust, pollen, loose fur, and dry air. She got tested for allergies and they assure us she doesn't have asthma. We have watched her carefully and noticed she does it mainly when she has her head twisted around while she's sleeping (as cats are wont to do) but if we nudge her and get to unkink her head it goes away. So if yours is doing that and it's head is twisted around in a funny position give him a shove to wake him up and see if he still does it when his neck is straight.  P.S. When the vet first checked her for this she burped while he was listening and I thought he was going to pee him self laughing about it.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Do you mean snort or snore, if that's the case its usually the result of the cat being overweight. but t could be a blockage in his/her nasal passage. Either way take it to the vet and they'll be able to help  Hope me helps
sSSpRtD2aa	You are epic fail please dont keep fish again.....ever|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Do your research before getting any animals. I cant be bothered to help as this question or similar to it has been asked hundreds of times and it all boils down to ignorance and lack of knowledge.|`|1sHBVWuKaa	You should keep the water at room tempature or your fish will die no matter how much food you throw at it or how often you scare the living **** out of it with your fish net and store it in a lil baggy while you wash away all of its belongings away and then throw it back into an empty home      OR YOU CAN GIVE HIM A TOILET BOLE FUNNERAL I HEARD THEY LOVE THEM! A NEW ADVENTURE|`|Qhdozm54aa	I'm very suprised that the fish aren't dead already, especially if you are keeping them in tapwater, which contains chlorine, heavy metals and possibly chloramines which are all lethal to fish.    If you don't want your fish to die you need to get them a proper aquarium with a filtration system. A jar is totally unsuitable for housing fish and to be quite honest rather cruel. Goldfish can grow fairly large (the common varieties can top 12"/30cm) and need a big tank with a powerful filtration system to handle the waste these fish produce. If you obtained these fish from an aquatic store I would take them back immediately and don't buy anymore until you have a proper tank and have researched into the needs of the fish.|`|t85b6QMiaa	Goldfish can live in cold water (as long as it is not frozen). They can tolerate a wide range of temperature from 2 to 25 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit). However, the ideal temperature should be 17 to 21 degrees Celsius (62.6 to 69.8 Fahrenheit).     First things that is important for goldfish is that they really need a large space to live in. Yes it is true that you can see many people keeping their goldfish in a small goldfish bowl. But this is not a good practice which will only shorten the life of those cute things. So basically, you should try to get a tank that is large enough for (how many of them?).    Don't give them too much food as this will only pollute the water more. If the food is too large for their mouth, can you try to crush it into smaller pieces? Then again don't use tap water as you change the water. Tap water may contain harmful chemical for your fish.      I do understand that you love them and want them as your pet, but keeping fish is a big responsibility. And putting them in a small jar can't be seen as a responsible thing to do.|`|AraBfesHaa	The best thing you can do for the fish RIGHT NOW is get them out of the jar.  Put them in the biggest bowl you can find, or even a  large cooking pot.  But they can't stay in those even for very long.  And, btw, they can jump out of any of them.  Again, you're lucky they didn't jump out of the jar last night, or did you have a lid on them (depriving them of oxygen)?  If you do put them in something larger, of course you're gonna have to add more water (dechlorinated) so make sure it's the same temperature as what they're in now.  Sudden temperature changes can kill them too.  You're lucky they were still alive after being in a jar all night.  And if you don't use dechlorinator in the water you will kill them, so I'll assume you put them in the jar with the water they came in from the store.  If you don't have the money to buy an aquarium to put them in, take them back if you don't want them to die, seriously.  You won't have them more than a couple of days at this rate, if that long.  I wouldn't trust any pet store that didn't tell you that you couldn't keep them in a jar!  I'ts pretty obvious those fish are doomed to an early death.  If YOU don't want them to die, you'd better do something quick.  What ever gave you the idea to get fish if you didn't have something to keep them in?  Obviouysly you're ready for that responsibility yet.|`|451601b6471222f0973ad6d54742f205aa	First of all you need to get them proper living quarters. Get some startrite and treat the tank for chlorine and other minerals that should not be in the tank. Check your fish and make sure that they did not develop ick, that is a white substance that will appear on their scales. Also if the water is cloudy there is a chance that you are over feeding them. Just give the no more than they can eat in five minutes. The temparture should be okay with room tempature, long as the room is not extremely cold. Temps that is below 65 degree's is very bad.
AraBfesHaa	First thing to do is get it out of the tank away from all the other fish.  They're going to kill it.  If you think it's a swim bladder problem, a frozen pea with the skin removed, and perhaps cut up might help it.  It wouldn't hurt it at this point to medicate it with an antibacterial medication. The best I've ever found is Maracyn2.  It's cured alot of my fish when I didn't know what was wrong with them.  They can have a bacterial infection without showing any outward signs of illness.    But it doesn't really have a chance as long as it's getting nipped at by other fish.  They will soon kill it.|`|k1L8GNAUaa	its over eaten...goldfish do that alot....it will recover soon|`|IE9NfLGoaa	that's weird don't worry he'll die in 1-2 weeks like most fish do then u won't hav 2 do that any more|`|9T09iprPaa	it sounds like a swimming bladder problem, the fish is being picked on because its weak, its what happens in the fish world, i dont think he has got long left on this earth to be honest, however my parents saved one by putting it in a seperate bowl when i was young and put an eltza seltzer in the water, dont ask me how this worked because i dont know it just did|`|0TTZERJmaa	it will die soon as this is not a good sign. it will be depressed because the other fish are bulling itthey only thing that is best for it is to put it in another tank if you dont have another tank just let it die then flush it down the toilet lol XD      there's plenty more fish in the sea xx|`|kgUzdfqVaa	Def swim bladder - the fish isn't able to digest food properly so becomes bloated, and literally floats to the surface.  I give my goldfish peas, or little bits of brocolli every so often to counteract this (it helps their digestion).  Another good way of helping them is by leaving them in the dark for 24hours (it really works - expert advice!)  Or try fasting all the fish for around 48hours - it won't kill them, and it will help with the swimbladder.  Don't feel them too much either - once a day is enough.  Hope your little fish gets better!|`|5I4imquJaa	fish can sense when the other fish have got something wrong with it, and usually they chase it because they eat it... sounds gross but thats what they do...    i have had tropical fish for years now... and you always know when one of the fish are ill, as the others chase it about the tank, nip at it etc until eventually it dies....    you could try getting a treatment for the tank, maybe it has swimbladder, it affects their bouyancy (floatiness) lol|`|B5zHetEqaa	It has swimbladder. Occasionally they can live with it but I would recommend you treat. You will need aqua salt and the medication from the pet shop. You can safely treat the water once a month for prevention too.  Good luck, hope he's ok!|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	its what you call constipation( when your fish's bowls aren't able to open properly) have you been feeding it to much food lately?  this always happens to my goldfish,you will have to get another fish bowl or something like that and put it in there by itself, and fast it for a few days at least 3-5days otherwise if u keep on feeding it too much food it  will die.|`|reTrCl5baa	the bubble sac has busted in it..  it will eventually die.. we had one to do that...  I would remove it  and put it in another tank, just in case that is not the problem....  such as  ick. or something else.  good luck.|`|U6sRJ69aaa	If your fish hasn't looked good for weeks it probably because it's not eating. Maybe your smaller fish and the other ones aren't good together in a fish tank. They might be eating all the food, before the smaller one gets any. I don't know why your fish is always upside down, the only idea that i have is that maybe it's dying haha. But that's my only suggestion, try taking it out for a while and putting it in a different bowl or tank, see what happens.|`|208549c0a73b82419e8bf972e6c47a97aa	Its the goldfish's swim bladder. If it always swam upside down then I would say the fish was fine...but since it swims right at time and at others it is upside down, is not a good sign. Your other goldfish are chasing it so my thoughts are this fish is going to die. Remove it to another bowl and see if it improves. If it does great if not then you have removed it from possible spreading something to your other fish. Good luck.|`|LNH3ZbsCaa	Hi there.  It sounds like your fish has either swim bladder or is constipated.  What size is your tank and do your other fish seems healthy?  Also how often do you do water changes and do you test the water parameters?  What do you feed your fish?  If feeding pellets, you're best to soak them in some of the tank water as feeding them straight out the container in some cases can cause fish to float.    For swim bladder you could try peas.  The peas should be cooked without salt and de-shelled when fed to Golides, they provide a good food source and can help to 'Clean' the fishes system. Most Goldie owners feed their fish peas at least once a week. Also they help if a fish is constipated or have Swim bladder problems where the fish becomes 'floaty'.     I hope this help and that your fish gets better.|`|e173150651568fabc77e97ff370458d3aa	i had a fish that was swimming upside down i left it 24hrs still didnt change so i took it out.as soon as it was out the water it died.sounds to me like the balance thingy that keeps them upright is knackerd.sorry!!!|`|Upky86M9aa	its dead.|`|WqsJf4kgaa	It's got swimbladder      http://www.aquatics-online.co.uk/fish_di...|`|5ciDai7Paa	you've got a weird one there! Its probably just playing dead, try trowing in a stick and see if it fetches it.|`|22EVxBYWaa	maybe its epileptic.?(:    answer mine?? go to my profile and click on da latest question ive asked. im wondering how old i look.?? plz and thank youu(:|`|98JZcrO6aa	nah i cant remember but i think fish do sometimes lie upside down motionless.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Swim-bladder disease.  It's lost it's float that keeps it upright.    It may die soon, or it may live for years.  It depends on what else it is suffering from.
bB0qV51Haa	Sounds like he passed a hard stool and may have constipation issues. Most times a cat drags their butt is because something isn't passing and it does itch as well as being desperate to get it out. Shame on your vet for not being more helpful. I add a 1/4 tsp of Metamucil to my cats wet food once a day to help them keep things moving smoothly (recommended by my vet, by the way because they are all long haired and have hairball issues). You can try that or you can get a second opinion by a different vet.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	It could be piles and/or hard stool as others have said.  I doubt it's internal bleeding, since he has been checked by a vet (even if the vet was a little unsympathetic!)  If the stool is hard, I've heard a bit of canned pumpkin in the food is good (not sure where you'd get it in the UK though if that's where you are!).  If his poo looks fine, and it continues to happen, then I'd take him back to the vet, or maybe another.  Blood in the poo can be a sign of something more serious.  But if it's just a one off I wouldn't worry.|`|a1dee089009df4acd57a32a73d6dd2d2aa	He could have a tear.  If it itches maybe that could be the reason why he drags his bum on the floor. Take him to another vet.|`|Amkmles0aa	http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGklte.YpJET...  call a vet|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	It is possible that the anal glands are impacted. There are two glands on the inside of the anus. If you look at the rectum as the face of a clock,  the glands sit at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions. These glands, when working normally, will express themselves every time the cat defecates. However, the secretions can become thickened and not express properly. They become full, and to relieve the pressure the pet will drag its butt on the floor to try to express them. Butt dragging is never a sign of worms. It is full anal glands.   If your vet didn't check this on your cat, I would suggest another vet. The anal glands can be expressed manually by the vet. It will be uncomfortable for your cat, it involves the vet inserting a gloved finger into the rectum (lubed of course) and expressing the glands. It stinks to high heaven. Do not try at home. You could harm your cat. The bleeding is probably from friction burns from the butt dragging.|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	He is bleeding internally.  Get him to ANOTHER vet.
FtBqmFDEaa	For an egg to be fertile (to produce a chick) the hen needs to have mated with a cockerel.  Hens that lay eggs on a commercial basis lay an egg almost every day regardless of whether they have mated with a cockerel. Therefore these eggs are always infertile (no chick in them).       You can still eat eggs if the hen does live with a cockerel, the chicks only start to develop inside the egg if the hen goes broody and decides to sit on them.  Most hens never go broody, they lay their egg and wander off.  You can also get fertile eggs to hatch if you take them and put them in an incubator. It takes about 21 days for a chick to develop and hatch. At about 10 days you can "candle" the egg with a torch in a dark room to see if their are blood vessels forming, this is the start of the "chick".     As long as you collect the hens eggs as they are laid every morning then you can eat them no problem. The chick will never develop if the eggs are kept at normal room temperature.|`|SUs4rN49aa	In order for a chicken to grow inside of an egg, it needs to be incubated at a particular temperature.. if an egg is taken away from the hen as soon as it is laid, it won't be able to grow because it won't be kept at a warm enough temperature.   Also, there are UV lamps that are used to determine whether or not a chicken is growing inside.. you can actually see the outline of the baby chick!|`|pX1g9aS4aa	they use scientific gadget where they see ,some they get the eggs on the time the hen gives the eggs then they will not wait when the egg cracks.|`|x5HMQgQyaa	Most commercial egg farms have thousands of hens in one barn. Hens. Females. If there are no males to fertilize the eggs, there is no chance of them developing into a chick.     Any bird can lay unfertilized eggs. Parrots, poultry, etc...    To find out wether an egg is fertilized, you can candle it.|`|BXLm8OVoaa	Chickens can lay unfertilized eggs but,  There is no way of telling if you don't know what conditions the egg has been kept in (without halming the egg, overwise use a candle) , but in industry they minimize the chances of an embryo forming by keeping the eggs cold and getting them eaten as soon as possible. There's no difference between the eggs which we can eat and the eggs which a baby chicken could come out of (apart from fertilization), it's just a matter of conditions.  Occasionally, you can find a small round black thing in the yolk which i have been told is of the blastocyst/embryo but you'd have to read more into that because i'm not sure if it was or not.|`|20J2VCxRaa	The question is why we eating out of hens butts I didn't like it so it won't go in my mouth same go with fish we never know what they been or where it came from.....
ard3L0hHaa	The best thing to do is ask friends and family who they go to, contact them, and interview each.  Look in the phone book and again call each one.  Ask all for references and FOLLOW UP on them.  It is a lot of work I know but will totally be worth it.  If you are getting your pup from a local breeder or shelter ask them for a reference as well.  Sorry I couldn't help anymore but I live in the triad, a little of your area.|`|6tE9eaBRaa	Well, I go to the Swift Creek Animal Hospital, so do five of my other friends. It is reasonably priced and the staff is extremely friendly. They also have special sales, so if you were thinking of having your puppy fixed, there are special prices. It is in Cary though. I hope you have fun with your pup!

It only takes one nip for someone to complain and if you can't show at least rabies shots, you have a real problems.    Distemper can also be a big problem and fatal.|`|AA12128656	no, do you already have a dog? because dogs need them...|`|0lnamekJaa	Go to your local shelter and find out if they have any programs to help you pay for the shots or if they have affordable plans.    If you go to a vet... They will tell you "I need a couple hundred dollars each in hand or else your dog will get every disease we are vaccinating against and they will die a horrible death... No we don't do payment plans."    Some vets are evil like that...     When my cat swallowed a needle, they not only over charged me for the single x-ray but told me that unless I paid them $2000.00 RIGHT THEN, in full, that my cat would die one of the most horrible and painful deaths you can possibly experience.     They asked me if I had friends or family that could pay for it... They tried to talk my aunt, who paid for the x-ray on her credit card, if they could just charge her credit card.    I knew I couldn't pay that much so I took him to the Anti Cruelty down town and they said "Feed him a lot of fiber and check his box for the needle and if it doesn't show up in a week or it looks like he is in pain bring him back."    Exactly 1 week later I found the needle and thread in the box (Thank the gods for latex gloves...) and he is just fine...    Vets, though they tend to be good people, are still just out for a profit...     Go to a shelter or anti cruelty or humane society... They just want to help... They won't tell you "$2000.00 now or they die".|`|AA10124869	A dog's first year can be pretty expensive yeah.

We've been back two more times each costing us about $60-$70 dollars for more shots. Now we have to get her fixed which will be around $300.    So plan on spending $80 dollars every 2-3weeks for a while|`|LsFUniCSaa	Yes and No. What I mean is, shop around. Shots are shots. I would probably say when it was all done and over (all puppy shots, etc) I spent around $175.00.|`|aHoeG6f5aa	Yes, it can get expensive for shots and Heartworm preventative, and everything else dogs need.    But it is a WHOLE LOT cheaper than the 800 dollars we recently spent to get our dog through distemper.  (she had it when we found her as a stray)
YXvfV7Ulaa	My cats fight all the time but it's only playing, they play pretty rough so unless they are actually hurting each other then I should leave them to it, try some catnip to chill them out a bit. The male is probably just trying to assert his dominance over the female, they'll get along soon enough.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	They will eventually become very good friends so make sure you get them altered! (spayed & neutered)|`|TepAZAHyaa	Leave them alone for the most part they will acclimate in there own time. By all means please break them up if it looks to serious but don't get yourself torn up either. I would use a spray bottle for discouragement. Good luck.|`|dd1uuMrpaa	You can't. They will get to the point where they tolerate each other in their own time. It sounds like the male is very playful and the female wants to be left alone. I had a similar situation not long ago and the cats get along fine now.|`|niMim3jNaa	Take them to training together, get them both fixed, put them in the same crate, and encourage them to play together, like with a toy or something.
t85b6QMiaa	If you really want a dwarf gourami, I suggest that you get another tank rather than keeping it in the current tank. With the addition of the Gourami, your tank will be overstock.    Dwarf Gourami may grow up to 5 cm in length. They are extremely tolerant both towards their own kind and other species. They are very peaceful, sometimes rather shy especially if you keep them with very active species. So your problem is not the chemistry of the community. It is about their living space.    My dwarf gourami prefer dark substrate rather than bright colour. I can tell this because of their colour became more intense and lively. They also swimming freely in the middle and top zone.|`|8A0j51F0aa	no thats over stocked and uncomfortable for that many fish. Please follow the 1 inch per gallon rule because theres a reason its a rule. Also the gourami may pick on the guppies because it doesnt like competition for beauty.|`|AraBfesHaa	rob's right.  the gourami is too much.  And if you have a female and male guppy, you'll soon have hundreds of them and need a bigger tank anyway.  Platys also.  Even if you purchased  just females, the chances are astronomical they're already pregnant, so be prepared for a huge population explosion in your tank.  If you want the gourami, get another tank for it, but make sure a 10-gallon is big enough for it.  It may need a bigger tank than that.  Don't listen to peeps at the pet store, research it on the web.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	your tank seems already overstocked|`|etA9BX5gaa	the dwarf will probably be real mean to your other fish.  and your tank is kinda full already.    i probably wouldn't add a goarmi in there..|`|BMri9tITaa	I agree with some, that you seem to have enough fish in there already.  You also have to take into account the aggressive nature of your chosen fish.  Although they are not as aggressive as their betta cousins, gouramis can be aggressive, and, if you have any females would think of your guppy and platy fry as a delicious snack.    You *can* go a teency bit overboard (but not much) in stocking yoru tank.  I would add another neon tetra and see how that goes over before you do anything else.  All three of the fish you have in there so far don't really feel comfortable unless they have lots of their own kind.
n8jrLDblaa	Depends on the owner. I personally don't like dogs in my bed....I prefer they sleep on the beds I provide for them.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Sure....If you like having fleas and smelling like your dog...|`|tecPZUq2aa	Only If They Are Fully House Trained Then It Can Be A Treat:)|`|kWwgWSSgaa	It's a matter of individual choice, but as a rule of thumb if the dog gets down on command, then yes it's fine.    {My two have been known to sneak up on my bed}|`|AA10229248	Many trainers & behaviorists believe that letting a dog sleep on the bed elevates the dog's status in the pack and can cause behavioral issues. Why should a dog listen to you if you're on the same level in the pack heirarchy?    With that said, if a dog is well balanced and understands that sleeping on the bed is a privilege, not a right, and you are consistant with the rules then it is usually not a problem.    Case in point. My dogs and my foster dogs are allowed to sleep on my bed. BUT that was not how it started out. First they sleep in a crate. Then they are given house privileges at night and can sleep where they want. If they immediately jump on the bed the first night out, they are moved to the floor. Sometimes it's an all-night process: dog jumps on the bed, I move him to the floor, he jumps back on the bed, etc.    Once the dog understands that their place is on the floor, they are allowed on the bed - BY INVITATION ONLY. If the dog gets snarky with any other dog (or cat) on the bed, or with me, they are instantly moved back to the floor. Once again, it is a privilege to sleep on the bed, not a right, and if you start acting like it's your bed, you are going to lose the privilege.    This has worked very well in my household. Sometimes I have 2-3 dogs (and a cat or 2) on the bed. Sometimes I sleep alone. Often the dogs will get on the bed for an hour or so and sometime in the night move to the floor.     My dogs are all well adjusted, well behaved dogs that compete in a variety of dog sports. We have a balanced relationship where they look to me for guidance and I maintain consistent house rules.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	mine does all the time,,,thats bonding,,,unless the dog has fleas|`|WSIZKAQcaa	My dog sleeps with me.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Depends.  The Alpha dog (who is you; the one in charge) would never share sleeping space with the rest of the pack. It's Pack rules...and the dog should never think it's your equal, because that can lead to a problematic dog.    However; if your dog is otherwise very well behaved...and it doesn't interfere with your sex life, than there is nothing wrong with it.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	sure- mine do.  you just have to remember that it may make them territorial of it, so if that behavior starts, correct it immediately.  The dogs should remember it is your bed, you just allow them on it.  Ours don't get into the bed until we invite them up.|`|2O58btqxaa	my jrt sleeps in the bed with me so yeh|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Personally for me, its okay for my dog to sleep on the bed, but when he started to claim the bed, that's when it started becoming an issue that I had to teach him to sleep on the floor.     My opinion: When the dog starts claiming your bed, it shows your spoiling him. Now my dog only gets on the bed on my command.|`|15Zr5voMaa	yeah it is fine as long as it doesn't go to the bathroom in ur room! lol!|`|HvFIHu3saa	my doggie has been sleeping with me since she was 6 weeks old she is now a 70lb pit bull.she is such a baby.|`|pMhc2ywbaa	yea...y wouldnt it be??|`|95yt7QkIaa	Yes, in this way your dog grows more aattracted to u|`|sfUUml0Daa	sure :D my doggie sleeps in my bed. just watch for shedding, our dog mostly sleeps at the foot of the bed, so its not that much of an isue|`|RUKh37e9aa	Of Course. My dog Sleeps In My Bed Every Night. Its Comforting To Know That He Is Always There For Me.|`|wX5xoAN8aa	It's really up to you. If the dog sheds hair a lot ( Like my dog) then it might not be a good idea if you want to keep your bed free of hair. If the dog doesn't shed hair, then sure let him/her sleep with you if you like.    Hope this helps ;)|`|wEbB1FuNaa	Yes as long as your not going to kick him out of the bed after a long period of time because that could confuse him/her|`|tk4PLUvnaa	only if the owner is okay with the dog on their bed.|`|mXO2TOUjaa	sure why not, I sleep with my dog.|`|AA10985791	Its supposed to give out the wrong signals to the dog about who is the 'pack leader' and all that,    But my dog seems to spend all day at the end of my bed.  She either sleeps or runs around like a lunatic.|`|9fdyfwO4aa	I think so!|`|Fe1Z7fpbaa	depends how the owner feels  if its a big bed with a small owner on it and a medium sized dog, sure!!!  if its a tiny bed with a medium sized owner and a huge dog, probably not  if your ok with your dog sleeping on your bed then sure!!! why not!!    hope i helped!!  clo  xx|`|8Zmt87LOaa	Maybe if it's a little dog that does not shed like a poodle or yorkie.   Not a big slobbery fuzzy shedding dog for sure.   Those should sleep  on a doggie bed in the floor.   Lots of people are allergic to dogs and the dander, so that should be considered.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Here's the Obedience Instructor's perspective:    This is NOT a good thing to do.    1.  If your dog should get fleas, ticks or worms, this is unhealthy for you.    2.  If your dog develops a bladder control problem, you may have warm, wet dreams.    3.  Letting your dog sleep with you puts you in the role of littermate, not leader.    4.  If m living situation changes and I have a significant other, I will not have a war about who gets near or in the bed.    So do I let my dog up on the bed???  Yes, BUT it is a privilege.  I say when it is ok and I say when they must leave.  This way I am still in a leadership position and I can control who all is sleeping in my bed.|`|9pVWBpC8aa	Of course! Its your dog, you have a choice on whether or not you want it on the bed or not. :)|`|eeBuJqRhaa	Yes, bus make sure he/she doesn't get too hot under the covers, my dog gets dehydrated easily under the covers but she sleeps with me...|`|ti8L5zryaa	I do not allow my dogs on beds or furniture.  They have comfortable beds in the bedroom., and I do not want them sleeping with us. It depends on the dog, but some dogs can get ideas about who is in charge when you allow them to sleep with you.  If they do not get possesive of their things or food, it probably would be okay.|`|lSaCUg0yaa	On but not in.|`|KfX1z8hOaa	Yea...why not?...|`|m9HkheDfaa	My dog does it.  He sleep with me, and I don't have any problem with it.|`|xpu4XgPXaa	No because there should be boundaries but if the dog is well behaved there is really no reason why not up to the person|`|JboaEdqpaa	yes if the owner likes it|`|oztoPKrGaa	Lol. I saw that on like judge lynn toler??  or w/e .. one of them judge shows.  and i think its fine.  As long as your dog is a house dog and isnt always dirty, or really huge then why not.  all of my animals have always slept w/ me:)|`|ixutx59Daa	Depends on the owner.  Both of mine sleeps with me ... under the blankets.|`|Li0q9NKCaa	yes, my jack russell sleeps with me under the covers every night :)|`|gj2IEXk7aa	if you want dog drool, fleas, hair and to smell like your dog go for it.|`|xx7hMcvfaa	My dog practically owns my bed. :(     She rolls around whenever and wherever she likes. She sleeps with pillows on her head. She's a good girl though, don't get me wrong and I lover her sooooo much like a little sister from another species. So to answer your question. Yep, it's ok for your dog to sleep in your bed. They're really great company. :)|`|AA10632604	Personal choice.  I wouldn't let my dog in the bed, she farts something nasty.|`|bed8QNUaaa	ew, no. its not ok.|`|YQ4oLtl9aa	yes :) if you want too|`|ZaPFztGJaa	My dog used to sleep on the bed and she was a big girl (Rottweiler). She was like a big teddy bear, but she knew she wasn't welcome on the bed when my boyfriend was in it. Also, she was an inside dog.|`|DOgCmZ2gaa	Hiya,     It really depends on you're personal opinion.     Dogs mindsets are that they exist In a pack. This is why some dogs are out of control, because they believe that they are higher up in the pack than "their" humans. Letting a dog sleep on your bed could be seen by the dog as an invitation to move above you in the pack.     In my personal opinion I don't believe that all Dogs are like this. If you  really want to let your Dog sleep on your bed then go for it! For Some dogs, it's a sign of affection from their owners!     Hope this helps!|`|LsFUniCSaa	Really depends on the comfort level of the owner and the allergy level of the owner! Just clean your sheets more often if you do!|`|0ef3O2m6aa	I think this is a matter of personal opinion.  If everyone sleeping in that bed is ok with it there is nothing wrong with it.  Wolf packs sleep together so it is natural for a dog to want to sleep with its human pack.|`|AA12128656	depends. if you have one dog (or even two) who OBEYS you and gets off the bed when you tell it, and doesn't have any dominance or aggression issues, then yes, it's ok.    if you have a dog who snaps, growls, or acts nasty to any family member, doesn't obey your commands, or acts in any way dominant, then NO it's not ok.    if you have 7 dogs like me (50-140 lbs) then it's not ok because there would be no place for me to sleep.
3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	Take a water pistol with you when you go through the park. When the dog comes running at you then squirt it. If it's owner says anything then explain that her dog is being anti-social and that you are fed up being harassed everytime you walk through the park. Tell her that unless she controls the dog you will report her to the rspca or such like, see if that works.|`|AA12128656	most areas have leash laws, and also laws about dogs aggravating people. i know in my town (Essex, CT USA) there's a pretty hefty fine for dogs annoying people (although we have no leash law, you will be ticketed if the dog is out of control)    let her know that the dog is bothering you and scaring other people, and ask her nicely to please leash it, so that everyone can enjoy the park. (do you keep your pup on a leash?)    if she refuses, report her to whatever authority handles that in your area. it's unacceptable for this woman and her annoying dog to take over an entire park that the whole community should be able to enjoy.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Tell Her Nicely That Her Dog Is Being Annoying.  If She Doesn Listen Report Her.|`|3MHxbRkGaa	Doesnt seem a huge threat to me it all depends on wether the other dog bites anyone or not theres not laws against a dog barking or coming up to you.

Don`t leave the park just because of some lazy person who thinks it right to allow her dog to try and attack you or   your dog.Ask other people in the park about the problem and talk it over.    EDIT: Do Not I Repeat Do Not Yell At The Dog,It could scare it and make it want to bite.If you yell at it you are more likely to get bit,It makes the dog think you are a threat and  its only defense is a bitting.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	I would definitely say something, and if she acts like its not a big deal, the next time her dog runs and barks at you, yell really loud at the dog and say "RAHHHHH!!!!" and im sure the dog will get scared and run away. If she says something, tell her to keep her dog on a leash and in control or you will continue to yell. What an inconsiderate person. That would really urk me!|`|VwEUO6reaa	have a quiet word with the jack russell owner and state that her dog should be under control at all times (thats the law) she may like you say be oblivious to the problem and until anyone points out the problem she may not be aware...seems a pity that no one else gets to enjoy the park because of one dog....good luck to you  i dont like jack russels ..nasty lil furballs...in my humble opinion|`|OxFsslN8aa	You should never "chance it".  The damage an attack can do to your dog both mentally & physically can lead to future mental instability like fear aggression & anxieties.  Even a large breed can become fearful of all other dogs due to an attack from a small breed dog.|`|Ah6hFHA2aa	Where is your park?  I will bring along my 7 dog pack and walk through your park!    If I was you with a young puppy I would have lost my temper by now.  If the owner won't control her dog then it is time for you to act.    I would get an empty can and 1/4 fill it with stones. Tape it all up so they can't come out. When the dog was coming towards me I would throw the can on the ground infront of it. Make sure it is long before it gets close to you. You don't want to frighten your own puppy.    The woman will defend her dog and then it's your chance to say your piece.|`|s9haCi64aa	Well for one if this dog attacked me or mine I would kick it! And 2 try and find out where she lives and make a complaint to the police, I did this when a mans GSD attacked my terrier and the plank didnt even say sorry so i took his number plate and reported him, the police came round mine took some info from me and then warned him, I havent seen him since|`|Hwybmzg5aa	shoot the evil little jack russel  only joking complain about her or beat her up ha ha ha don't really beat her up|`|rsdKX1fyaa	1) tell the dozy trollop you don't appreciate her dog hanging around you, and that it frightens your puppy.

Tell the park keepr (if there is one)|`|LsFUniCSaa	As a Jack Russell Owner I can tell you they are mostly bark and no bite. They are just naturally aggressive dogs, but aggressive in the way that they just want to play and play and play. I say, try it out one time, see how it goes and if you are uncomfortable you may have to drive a distance to another park, but if you are in the mood to ware you animal OUT have him play with the JR and he will sleep through the night!
fO1ZzPXyaa	Your fish have ick. Go to wal-mart. They have medicine for your tank. It is "jungle" brand and the name of it is ick clear. The fish that are already infected may still die if you didn't catch it quickly enough, but it will save the others from it. As for overcrowding, just be careful. I have a 10 gallon with 2 upside down catfish, 3 barbs, 2 platys, 3 danios, and a cory cat. I've had all of these fish for at least 2 years, and the only problem I've ever had was one case of ick.Good luck and get it quick!|`|2sDLVCDiaa	Are these dots white?    If so it is 'ich' or better now as white spot.  It is contagious so treat it immediately. Go to your local fish store and they will have medicine readily available. I am treating right now and it has just gone away.     AquaGirl|`|rqH8mAM2aa	you need clean your tank and filter if it is something from another fish  you need to remove plants and maybe coral because they mite retain   the bacteria i wish you a lot of luck!  OH all the rock and all the parts you need to clean good luck!|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Way too many fish in a small tank for one and for two in a newly cycled tank which takes 3 weeks with 2 fish in it to cycle you can only add a couple fish at a week. The neon's could have brought in a sickness but most likely they are dieing form ammonia poisoning.     Goggle these things and learn    Fish tank Nitrogen cycle.    Fish tank cycle.    Good Luck|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	You need to be keeping an eye on the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels. Sounds like this tank is cycling. Change 30% of the water with a gravel vac every other day for the next month. After that, if the ammonia levels are starting to drop, start changing the water every 3 days. After about another week, if ammonia continues to go down, then start changing less water. Continue until you are down to a 15% water change weekly.    You may lose a few more fish in this process. Do not add anymore (unless they all die) until after this process is complete.    Sounds like you also have a ich outbreak. This would be due to stress. If your ammonia levels are not high, then treat the tank for ich and you can skip the water changes, but I am betting the farm that your ammonia levels are sky high.=|`|qjH3Tigbaa	I would honestly say in a 10 Gallon tank with, assuming I counted correctly, upwards of 10 fish is WAY to operpopulated.  Then you added PLANTS and the undergravel kit loses around a half gallon of space.  Plus rocks.  So figure you have a 9 Gallon tank.  Then you add in the room taken up by your filter, air source and any other decorations and they are theoretically only swimming in 7-8 Gallons of water.  The Plant adds clutter to an already small tank.  THe white spots are probably ICK which you can treat.  And if one fish has it in a crammed tank like that you can bet certain that its spread to the others.  Get to a pet store TODAY and get some treatment for ICK.  Bring a water sample with so they can test the Ph for you.  Replace 50% of your water TODAY as well.  But you really do have too many fish in that small little tank.|`|QikvnTnqaa	White dots?! That's ick!!! That will kill your fish very quickly! Got buy the treatment! like eye drops! It's lik $3....    And also, that is WAY to many fish. And catfish get big. Your tank is set up badly.    If you can see they white dots, get off th computer and go get it now. The bottle will say use different doses with tetras and with other fish. Ignore that. I, personally, think it's better for the tetra to OD then let the others die too.    Add some today. Then add it (assuming yours is like mine) everymorning. START TODAY! I'm serious. As soon as I saw it I went to get some the next day (10pm when I found it) and 3 fish died in that time.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	You have a case if "ick". Go get the meds, quick! Also, Ick can be brought on by temp. change. Even if the temp. drops a degree or so, ick will happen. check your temp. and keep an eye on it. But get the meds quickly!|`|8bef1b50aa3d5b7e84321e722510a842aa	2 tetras, a catfish, a shrink, a mickey, and 3 neons?  you better have a 25gallon or more for that load.  You ovrloaded your tank, and the ammonia level went up.  Your fish couldnt handle it.  Some had to die off for the others to survive.  Use less fish if you only have a 10gal
AA12128656	rotten, i think that's pretty much the way it goes.  i wouldn't allow my dog to potty in the house, they were "housebroken" at 8 weeks (babies still have accidents, but they know what they were supposed to do)    i can't imagine WHY someone would encourage a dog to eliminate in the house. YUCK.|`|qioH81tiaa	I have no idea, and no urge to try to train it, lol.    I always wonder about what happens when those dogs go visit another house, or stay in a hotel, etc.  Or what happens if someone puts a newspaper on the floor - is it free game?    I know some people who do this, and they have their justifications for doing so.  It's just not for me.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	I agree with you, i never used those for my dog when he was a pup and he learned to go outside very early on. When my friend got her puppy she used them and now (three years later) the dog still goes in the house. I really don't understand how you are supposed to teach the dog either, at least without the dog permanently thinking the floor is his toilet.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Well coming from me who has done both training its really not the best thing to do. Our frenchie was paper/litter box trained well she now is bad about pooping and peeing in the house because of it. We do paper train and pee pad training with our puppies mostly do paper training now because its a lot cheaper.     We got thise ex pen like things that are raised off the ground and have a bottom with paper in them for our pups and they usually pick it up with praise. With some of our older dogs we have put grates in the bottom of their crates and put paper underneath them.     Its easy to wean them off it too cept for our frenchie who is stubborn.    Well kip our 2 one year olds still have grates in their crates and we took them to a really high end hotel for nationals, and guess what their paper stayed dry the whole time, cept for water from their rabbit feeder like water feeders.    Note: Our neighbors stock up their newspapers and give them to us, plus we stock up our own.    We never used paper on the floor cept for our weimaraner litter but they had a specific area and we put plastic under neath it all. they were more interested in chewing through the walls then the plastic those little buggers.     We now use crates and raised ex pens.      NOTE: We only use this for our young dogs, our older ones know to go outside.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Training is done in the same way as training to go outdoors - take the dog to the pad when it is time for the dog to go, reward when uses the pads, confine to a small area with the pad when unable to supervise.    Dogs very often associate elimination areas with substrate rather than exact location. For instance, my dog would have to be near the point of exploding before she would eliminate on concrete (which she would have to do when I brought her to work with me) because she was trained to go on grass in the yard. As long as the floors in the home are not covered in soft cotton batting, most dogs will go on the pad and not on the floor.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Many people recommend crates.   But for using the pee pads, make sure to place it in a specific spot, maybe the bathroom. If you see a fresh spot that the dog made, wipe it up with a wet sponge or cloth and dab it onto the pee pad so that the dog recognizes the scent on the pad. Since you've had dogs for 30 years, you know the signs when the dog has to pee (circling, sniffing, scratching floor, etc) take him to the pee pad each time.    Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|48I58Awsaa	I 100% agree with you (DeeDawg).  It's nasty and I can only imagine the smell of poop/ pee in the house, makes me vomit.    But since I try to see the good in everything, some people just can't come home on their lunch break to take their dog outside and are gone for 12 hours +. However, why would you get a dog in the first place if you don't have the time/ energy.    To me, a dog is supposed to run and be free outside when it's time for business and not locked up in the house all day, just cause his/ her owner was not able to think about the consequences.      Go get a cat, if you can't provide for a dog ;)|`|6AqFenaSaa	Idunno, either. It seems pretty simple: you train the dog to pee on the floor. My friend used these and it would always remind me of that quote from Jaws. The old captain Quint is eying the shark cage contraption and says, "Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water. Our shark."|`|1bRRODd2aa	Pee pads should only really ever be used in combination with crates or enclosures.  It really is a bad idea to teach a pup that going pee anywhere in a house is OK, and that's what you are teaching it if you just put a pee pad down on the floor somewhere.|`|ard3L0hHaa	The way we trained my sister's toy poodle to pad train(there are too many predators outside that would carry it off in a heart beat) is this.    We bought the reusable pads(the poodle wouldn't use the disposable ones) and put in the bathroom near the toilet.  Let's face it, it will always smell like a toilet no matter how often you clean it(especially if you have guys living in the house;).  From there you train EXACTLY like you would otherwise.  Everytime you know it is time to potty you take it to the pad and wait for the pup to do it's business.  Once the dog learned that that is what you expect from him then you move to the next step.  Every time it is potty time place the pup in the bathroom and leave(closing the door behind you.  After a few moments you open the door and let he puppy out.  My sister's dog is fully potty trained this way.  He has had NO accidents now and he doesn't have to hold it in for hours on end.    ADD:  The dog has never had an accident when he visit's friends and family.  If no pad is put down he asks to go out.  He doesn't go on newspaper or other clothing.  JUST THE REUSABLE PAD.|`|Ct1Z2utdaa	I never understood using pee pads.  It just seems very illogical.  Our puppy had about 5 accidents in the house and we crate trained him.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I agree I have a dog that uses pee pads. I hate them. She does go on them but she goes in the floor also. I am currently working on getting her to go outside. I am sure some dogs use them like intended but I do agree it seems to confuse mine. They are in the floor so she thinks the floor is ok too.|`|IcfoAI3naa	I can only understand the meaning behind the pads, and That is the pads has ammonia in them so the pup or dog will know where to pee  The owner should watch the pup, and every time the pup go's to the pad which should be placed at the front or back door the owner should quickly open the door and let the pet outside then it will learn that when it go's to the door it gets to go outside and potty. But I would never use that method, I have always used the feeding schedule method.and my pups are trained in three days|`|ZGkGLW4gaa	I agree with you.  I would think people would only use them to line crates or carriers with. I did know a rabbit once who was trained to use them because the owner was disabled.|`|WLNX00c3aa	a friend of mine uses this method in her porch area. she lives in an apartment complex and she's the upstairs.  the washing of pee is not sanitary as it drips on the the neighbor's area below.    i've read that you line an area to where the puppy will be able to have access, such as a corner of the kitchen, that's about 3x3 pads wide. then as the dog hits it's mark each time you make it smaller and smaller.  letting the dog associate itself to the 'pad'. then you slowly move that pad outside when the dog is able to hold it's bladder better.    i've only used the pads as lining in the crates under the beds, and on cushions.  there is no scent on the pad.  its jst constant repetition and association that has to be done for this method to work. the dog will learn where to go if you teach him.|`|AA11992723	LOL I tried them. it didn't work. The only thing that worked was removing the previously soiled carpet (where she missed the puppy pad.) and getting professional cleaning. After the floor was all cleaned, not one accident.
kWwgWSSgaa	Curtis M succinctly hit the nail on the head.    Male Dobermanns can be a handful, especially during adolescence when they may try to assert their authority over other males. They are physically strong & can be difficult to control by people inexperienced with the breed.     Whilst males may not always be the first to instigate a fight with another dog, they are territorial and will not tolerate any aggressive behaviour from other male dogs.     Male/male is potentially a very poor combination & not recommended by the Dobermann Club.    You already have a very young dog, so I would strongly advise waiting until yout Pit Bull is around 18 months old before considering purchasing another dog. Undertake more research to determine if you could offer a suitable home for either a female Rottweiler or Dobermann. The breed clubs would be a good starting point.|`|AA12128656	i suggest you pick one or the other, don't get two pups at the same time.    if your pit bull pup is friendly with other dogs, you should not have a problem with either breed. be careful though, an older pup could easily injure a baby pup in play.|`|3giaPYe8aa	You probably don't want to hear this, but you asked.  I would not keep 3 males together.  Many people will say that it all depends on how they are raised, but I can tell you for a fact that male Dobes can be same sex aggressive, even when neutered.  If you are not a VERY experienced dog owner, you are going to have a disaster.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Why would you want to create a potentially bad situation. What's going to happen if you can't make the situation work out well. More homeless dogs in shelters?? Don't get anymore dogs if you don't know how they'll interact.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	I agree with not getting two males.  As the other poster said, the males of those particular breeds have a tendency to not get along with other males.    I'm curious as to why you want to get *two* puppies?  That's an awful lot of work, and they are more likely to bond to each other than to you.  Also, they will be the same age, get old at the same time, and, sadly, pass on at about the same time.  Why not stagger the ages of your dogs out a little more.|`|XEbe4Votaa	Having 3 dogs under a year is an absolutely terrible idea.  There is almost no way you will be able to bond them to you as well as if you didn't have 3 young dogs to worry about, and their training will suffer.  It is exceptionally difficult to have 3 dogs in a household as it is, 3 puppies would be a very bad idea in my opinion.    All 3 dogs would definitely need to be fixed if you want to avoid problems, and even then there is no guarantee when the hormones kick in.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Any mix of dogs would get along if the pack leader told them to.  Are you going to be the pack leader?  Can you calmly and assertively make two dogs get along?  Will you set rules, boundaries & limitations for them?  Will you be able to provide them adequate exercise so that they don't build up energy & bad behaviors?|`|U1RcZjqJaa	As long as they don't fight for dominance you will be fine. It sounds like you already have one well socialized dog, so socializing him to new dogs shouldn't be an issue. Its all dependent on the dog, not the breed.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	with those three breeds, I do not suggest having more than one male, even if they are neutered and raised together.  male dog aggressiveness is still a problem in those breeds and can take a year or two before it surfaces.|`|wscyjkPAaa	I think they will get along.  We have a female German Shepherd, a male American Pit Bull Terrier, and a Belgian Tervuren, they get along fine, they rough house a lot but thats about it.  Also, they're all fixed so I imagine that also helps.  I believe most fights happen when dogs are "in tact" due to the hormones and breeding cycles.  But I think they'll get along as long as they know that you are the boss.  If you're the boss all the dogs will follow you, if you're not, then there will be competition for who is in charge of the "pack".|`|Oeoi5KG1aa	I HAVE A PIT MYSELF A MALE N HES NOT FIXED (HE 10 MONTHS OLD) BUT IF U R PLANNIN 2 GET 2 MALE DOGS MAKE SURE THEY FIXED  I BROUGHT HOME MOR THEN 1CE MALE DOGS NONE FIXED N 4GET IT I COULDNT KEEP THEM  BUT IM BRINGIN HOME A FEMALE DOG N HE HAS LIVED WIT MY MOM IN LAWS FEMALE DOG JUST FINE  ALSO INTRODUCE THEM OUTSIDE DA HOME|`|paCHaDWVaa	I have a male boxer and he is 4 months old,  my sister has a male and a female pit bull and they are full grown, and they get along fine.

Anybody who wants a "Pitbull, Rottweiler, a Doberman, and 6 German Shepherds" is somebody trying to impress somebody with how tough they are with their command over such "imposing beasts"! In otherwords, pull your head out of the clouds and be happy with your pitbull. 3 male working dogs + Inexperienced owner who has no idea what real training is = Dead dogs/severely injured dogs/mauled children/mauled YOU even.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Is there a reason you badly want only 'muscle breeds'?

They're dogs.  It's dogs raised by idiotic people that are aggressive.  There's no reason why they shouldn't get along if raised and socialized properly.

3zm0jA0yaa	I wouldn't think your wife leaving would have anything to do with it unless the cat started this behavior at the same time that it happened.   Anyway, that's really weird for a cat to stop using the litter box after years of using it. But I have heard that once a cat uses the carpet, that she will go back to it because of the smell alone. So you have to make darn sure the urine smell is gone. They have stuff at Pet Smart that suppose to get rid of the smell or cover it. Try that. And as soon as you catch her using the carpet again ( & you will have to scope her out doing it) pick her up before she finishes, pop her tail ( like a spanking but lightly and make some welcomed sounds of protest) and put her directly in the cat box and make her stay there for as long as you can ( a couple of minutes) Keep doing that and she will get the idea that her mishaps aren't welcomed at all and that you have showed her the correct place to go. It worked for my cat. Hopefully it will for yours. And please let the cat in at night. I don't know where you live but it is so very cold outside at night in Feb. At least put  her in ;the bathroom where the litter box will be and close the door. At least she will be warm. Thanks! and good luck!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	put her poop in the litter box that may get her to use it|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I would try keeping her locked in a small room with the litter box so that she will get the idea. Litter box training is usually the only thing that you can teach a cat, after that they train you. Dogs have owners Cats have staff.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	treat her as you would a dog! Be strict! Let her back in the house! But when she poops or pees on the floor say "NO!" in an angry tone! then push her face in it and repeat "NO~!!" for about a minute then let her go and  then put her poop in her litter box!|`|nJOYHuyZaa	She probably has a UTI  When a cat gets one, they will stop using the litter box because they associate the pain w/ the box( that's what my vet said)  Have her checked for a UTI  Edit.  Also, if you let the box get too dirty, the cat won't use it anymore.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	When a cat suddenly stops using the litter box, it's usually a health issue or a stress problem.  Your cat is trying to tell you that something is wrong.  Since it's been a year since your wife moved out (sorry to hear  about that), that's probably not the problem now.      The first thing you'll want to do is to take her to the vet to see if she has an urinary tract infection.  Treatment is simple and low cost.  If she gets a clean bill of health, it's probably a stress problem which can be anything from a change in litter brand or litter box to bringing a new pet home. Some cats don't do well with change.    To get her back in the litter box, try Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attactant. It's a finely ground herb mixture that is sprinkled on top of regular cat litter and costs around $13.99 (one 20 oz. container treats 100 lbs. of litter). It also comes with a great brochure with all kinds of information about cats and litter box problems. This product works well with all sorts of litter box problems even with adopted feral cats (check out the consumer reviews on the Internet).    I have found that cleaning urine messes with vinegar is great in a pinch, but I've had better luck with Nature's Miracle.  When you clean, even if you can't smell it, your cat still can and will be attracted to the same spots and do it again.  Nature's Miracle works by breaking down the enzymes in the urine so it not only removes the odor but keeps the cat from returning to the same spots.    Urinating out of the litter box is a common but easily solved problem.  Lots of us have already been through this with success so if you can try the good advice everyone is giving you here, you'll soon have your problem resolved.|`|KbZIsj7Caa	clean your carpet with white vinegar, it'll take all the stains and smells out, so it won't go back to that spot. change your litter box, and wash it really good, before putting kitty litter back, also you might want to try a new kitty litter, something with baking soda to kill the smells, next try putting the litter box out of the way of traffic, bathroom or laundry room works pretty good, it needs to be somewhere private, cause cats are private creatures. now that you have the kids there, your cat needs time to adjust to it. pretty soon it'll start using the litter box again, just hang in there and let it back in the house.|`|UkhAYJxhaa	some ideas--  clean the liter box really well  retrain her to use it|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	First of all you have to wash the carpet spots with white vinegar.  We can't smell it, but the odor of past "mistakes" is still there and she will be drawn to it.  White vinegar with take the old odor out.    Second, is her litter box in a private, easily accessible place?  This may be the problem.  Even though you may scoop it often, some cats don't like a smelly litter box, try using baking soda in it.  The formula I use is 1/3 baking soda and 2/3 kitty litter.    Third, try putting the litter box in a private room (such as bathroom or laundry room) with a washable floor for a few days/nights and keep her in there with the box at night.  This may work.    Sorry I couldn't be of more help.|`|niMim3jNaa	I don't think your wife leaving would have anything to do with it. I mean, was your wife really close with the cat? Like did she hold it quite often and possibly they had a bond? I don't know, maybe that's far-fetched. I doubt that even if she left, the cat would be traumatized over it so much that it stopped using the litter box. That is strange though, that after going for two years it would all of a sudden stop. Be sure you have a litter box with a lid, try using Fresh Step litter, and maybe even try putting the litter box OUTSIDE with her, like right by the door or something, and see if it goes in it. Gradually, she might gravitate back towards that smell. And yes, cat urine is the world's hardest odor to get rid of! Anyway, eventually, bring it back into the house and put it in a small room immediately after feeding it with the litter box, and then put it back outside. You will somewhat have to retrain it, but since it already knows a little bit, it won't be as hard. And cats are usually pretty easy to potty train. Good luck and hope this helps!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Any sudden change in litter box behavior can be a sign of a health issue.  Since cats can't say "Hey... it hurts when I pee." they'll sometimes eliminate outside the litter box as their way of telling us that something is wrong.  It may be that she has a urinary tract infection.  I think your first step should be to take her to the vet for a checkup.  Explain the change in her behavior so they'll know where to start.    If health issues are ruled out, the next thing to consider is whether or not anything has changed.  Did you switch brands of litter or the litter box itself?  If so, switch back to what you were using before.  Cats are creatures of habit and they don't like having things changed around too often.  If you have a covered litter box, try using an open one.  Many cats prefer open boxes to enclosed ones.  Make sure that you scoop the litter at least once a day, preferably 2-3 times a day.  Some cats are picky about the litter and want it to be super clean.  Some cats also prefer to pee and poop in different places.  Try adding a second litter box.  This can make a world of difference in some cases.  The article linked below has lots of great information about cats and litter boxes.  It's a long read, but well worth the time.  It will help you to get a better understanding of cats and litter box habits.  Good luck and hang in there.  I'm sure this can be resolved so both you and your cat can happily coexist indoors.  http://www.catinfo.org/litterbox.htm|`|kW5HfnRnaa	poor kitty.  i can totally picture my cat knockin on the window if i let her out.  have you taken her to the vet to rule out a tract infection....and wife leaving would affect cat.  but when did she start using your carpet as her bathroom.  right away?    keep taking her to the litter box and scratch her paws in it....pretend she is a kitty like when you first got her.  and show her extra love    http://michelescattraining.blogspot.com/|`|BEKU3RPRaa	please stop blaming your wife for things she have know control over. just change the litter box and let the cat back in it is cold out there!!!|`|26619ce88aefb73d3da06270a3d7c3e2aa	Yes it is possible that the animal will also be affected as the children and you will. Animals are also part of our family's, most people do not understand this but they are a living thing and have feelings as well as we do. The cat just may have another kind of medical problem also like a kidney infection, you might just have it checked out by a veterinarian to make sure. This is one way they do talk to us to get our attention being they can't talk our language. I know at times this may be costly but if you love your animals as I do it is money well spent to be able to save its life and to keep it. As am sure your children are very attached to it and if something was to happen to it they would surely miss it.   You might also make sure the litter box is kept clean as some cats when they are not clean enough they will not use it, I know as I have one cat if her box is not up to her standards she will go outside the box.   Most times it is not best to be letting an indoor cat that has been used to being kept in all the time to all of a sudden be let outside. You just may be in a situation that you have to retrain it for the indoors, catching it in the act rubbing its nose in it and putting it into the litter box.   I wish you Good Luck
AA10356572	read this link on why they do it.. and how to get it to stop    http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Coprophagia...    its not going to make him sick, but might make him vomit|`|7xkwE3X9aa	My dog does that sometimes, he also will eat it when it's outside too.  I think it's just a disgusting habit. Also, maybe they do that when they poop inside so they can "get rid of the evidence",lol.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Your vet can sell you a powder that you give for 2-3weeks wiht his food, it will make his poop taste horrible (you think it already would! haha) After he tastes a few poops this way, he will think they all will taste that way & stop. YOu can also use meat tenderizer, or monasodium glutemate, but the vet stuff is better. Is he eating it to try to hide it so he won't get in trouble? I'd get him outside til he goes as much as possible. Crate him when you can't keep an eye on him, most dogs will not soil their bedding area.|`|zb3ImEQ6aa	Eating feces can make him sick over time. It also increases the chance of worms as well as other parasites. There are several reason why he could be eating his own mess but to know for sure there are tests your vet can run. As it could a mineral deficiency in his diet which will make them eat feces. Boredom can cause it. Undigested food in the same way they will eat their own vomit.  The reasons are numerous. Your best bet to stop it is contact your vet for suggestions a phone call is free and takes up little time. Second get him fully house broken. And use the little tricks mentioned to discourage eating of feces.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Coprophagia (stool eating) most often a bad habit but can be caused for several other reasons:    1. Dog is not digesting his food.  2.  Dog is missing important nutrients in his diet.    So, you need to see your Vet to make sure that your dog is getting a complete diet and is utilizing his food properly.    Accent (MSG) in his food will alter the taste and make it unappetizing to him.    Housebreaking your dog will also help.|`|AA12128656	it's more like a bad habit.   the biggest problem here is that the dog isn't housebroken.   crate train and housebreak the dog, and you'll see the problem magically disappear, as you'll be able to clean it up outside immediately when you are walking the dog on leash.    if you let the dog out into the yard to potty, you can also give him a few bits of pineapple with his dinner, this makes their poo acidic.  sometimes dogs will eat poo also if it's not fully digested, so talk to your vet about a food that's more digestible for the dog.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	The concerning behavior is that he is pooping on the floor.  Obviously if he was pooping outside,  you would be picking it up and disposing of it as it is happening and he wouldn't be eating it.  Take him on nice long walks about 45 minutes after he eats and walk him until he goes.  Then praise him like crazy.  There is a powder that you can sprinkle on his food to make him not eat his poop, but I'd be more concerned that a 2 year old dog is not house broken.|`|xcd9k8evaa	My dog used to do that when she was a puppy. Sprinkle meat tenderizer on your dog's food, it will make your dog not want to eat it's poop. That's what we did and she stopped. Hope this helps. Good Luck.|`|OxFsslN8aa	He is trying to hide the fact that he did wrong.  What is your reaction when he poops in the house?  Remember it is your responsiblity to get him outside to take care of "business".  If he is pooping in the house it is you who is to blame; not him.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	This is not a good habit for him to have! You need to house train him. And if you cannot watch him while you are upstairs, you need to crate him. The idea of the crate is that they will not poop in their "den".     Also, you need to watch him when you take him out, to make sure he's not ingesting it when he's outside, too. He could get worms or any number of parasites from this nasty habit!     My Boston terrier did this until I would chase her away from her poop after she finished...then go and pick it up to prevent her returning to it to eat it.    I had to have her wormed several times, but she doesn't eat her poop anymore, mainly because I pick it up immediately after she goes or she knows I'll chase her from it so I can go inside and get a poop pick up bag.   Crate training your dog is the first step.     Taking a poop in the house is also not healthy for you living in the house and absolutely disgusting!    See the links below for crate training.

hdQvbs0naa	Yep! I used to take my guys into the bathroom for their playtime, and they always had a good time. Try adding some fun toys, like cardboard tunnels and "trash cans." To make a safe trash can for your ratties to dig into just get a cardboard box and full it with all sorts of things, old socks, crumpled paper, bits of popcorn, anything you know he likes to play with. They LOVE digging around in trash cans.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes it is. How about getting them a drum or wheel to roll around in too?|`|X4hz3a9haa	Rats are highly intelligent and can be trained to perform simple tricks prompted by voice commands using repetition and rewarding with treats. Training requires consistency, ensuring always to use the same voice commands.    Rats can be trained to come when called, and this can be started by calling them and getting them to come to the front the cage and rewarding them with a treat. Training can then progress outside the cage waiting until the rat has wandered a little way away and then calling them to come fetch their reward using the same voice command. Ultimately a rat can be placed on the floor and trained to not only come back but to climb up its owners legs and body onto their shoulder to obtain their treat. However, it is best to wear thick trousers when performing this trick in order to avoid ending up with scratched legs!|`|kew2l7Acaa	Get them some little dumbells as well be perfect.|`|pK7saLw4aa	thats good. another fun thing for them is to fill a box with corn starch packing peanuts or shredded paper. they'll have a blast XD|`|nwH5ax40aa	Yes it is, remember to close the lid of the loo, cos i put mine to play in the bathroom and he nearly went into the loo|`|RIVywiykaa	Get them some fabric with holls in it and tie it to the shower rode so that it hangs tothe floor. they can clim on it.|`|AA11305153	sounds good to me.

bxlYleZkaa	They are attracted to the heat and can sense a change in the smell of the rad when it is hot.|`|pK7saLw4aa	Because your rats want to be warm and thier cold without the radiator. The rats might also be interested in the smell coming from the radiotor. You can put chicken wire around the radiator so they can't go near it. Also, you can move your rats out of the bathroom|`|4gYQnfL7aa	dont worry :D   they are just attracted to the heat..  we like going next to radiators when they are on, its the same thing! :D   also yes smell is another reason xx|`|fEcV1CB7aa	their interested in it and it's warm so they like it until on of them hurts them selves on it they won't relise it's dangerous
Zu2oVVhoaa	most likely pregnant! You will see some weight gain! and you will notice that your cat will either be extremely affectionate or trying to keep to itself as much as possible! If the cat hisses at you at all ... dont worry! She is just acting on instinc and trying to protect her babies!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	You need to get her checked. An unspayed cat is at risk from mammary cancer, and mammary cancer is AWFUL in cats.Even if it is just swelling due to pregnancy, you should be taking her to a vets anyway - preferably to get her spayed.    It isn't good enough that you've got homes for the kittens. Those homes are needed for the kittens that are dying in shelters. Tell the people that want your cat's kittens to go and get one from a shelter. Tell them you're going to do the right thing by your cat's health and by the cat population in general by having her spayed.    Chalice|`|niMim3jNaa	possibly pregnant or if she isn't pregnant, sometimes going into heat can trick the body into producing milk anyway, or more so just have the glands swell for the time being. it's kind of like how a woman might get tender breasts on her period. same thing. hopefully she'll have adorable little kittens though!!|`|d3BOTPCyaa	she is definitely prego! you will witness weight gain and also later throughout the pregnancy you will be able to hear and feel the babies moving around her stomach. u will also notice discharge.     your best bet is to get a cardboard box or something of the sort and put covers make it all warm and dark too, and get her use to going on there. If you don't, she will go off and hide her kittens somewhere and u won't be able to find them.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Could be pregnancy, could be mamary tumours... maybe a trip to the vet?    When it comes to her having kittens, if you want my opinion... I am not of the 'only purebreds should have kittens' school.  Many purebred dogs now have horrendous problems, because only the 'best' have been bred from, leading to loss of genetic diversity, and an increase in genetic problems.  Cats are in danger of going the same way.  It's my belief that we need some breeding of lovely, unique, diverse moggies.  I'm also glad you say you are going to keep one: it's no good to your cat if you let it have 'just one litter', and then take them away and leave her pining for them.    On the other side... there are too many kittens being thoughtlessly produced.  And yes, each one that you get a good home for may be taking a potential home from one in a rescue.  If every pair of male and female cats (2 cats), had just one litter (generally averaging 4-5), then the population doubles every generation.  Therefore we cannot allow every cat to have kittens: maybe it's fair to have one litter for ever 4-5 cats you take care of for life (though less would be better, due to numbers being thoughtlessly produced, sigh).  I also believe it's responsible if you are going to let your cat get pregnant to have her and the potential dad checked for viruses such as FIV and FLV, which could be passed to the kittens and cause and early and unpleasant death.  Cats with any possibility of being part Persian or British Shorthair (and a few other breeds...) also need to be tested for PKD, a genetic kidney problem.
EaNjIhoQaa	Farrier fees have a wide range but for a barefoot trim on my horses I pay anywhere from $30-$40. I have an Appy who gets the regular keg shoes on the front and corrective egg bar shoes on the back and I payed the farrier $85 for that.    I used to have a farrier that did a crappy job on my horses and he charged $25 per barefoot trim. But once the farrier messes up your horse's feet it could take a long while to get it back to the point where the horse is comfortable again. You pay more money for better quality most of the time.     Hope this helps and God bless!|`|H2gwQac6aa	i dont know what country you live in but i like un the UK and my farrier charges 65 per horse, this is for a file and trim, 4 hot shod shoes on and road studs.  hope this helps :D|`|MtmpOqZ7aa	My horses are both barefoot and they cost $50 for a trim. I am *very* lucky in that my horses both have excellent hooves and they are actually able to go about 4 months inbetween trims.  Typically trimming/shoeing would be every 6-8 weeks. Shoes can be very expensive especially if the horse needs any corrective shoeing and/or pads.|`|vow5ULxTaa	45 for trim 60 for front shoes.  I hot shoe so its really orht it.  And our farrier isnt a grumpy old sausage hes really nice and loves workign around horses.|`|cGRyDCpQaa	We just switched farriers not too long ago so I'm not too sure but I think it's $20 for a trim and $65 to reset shoes.    Our farrier comes to us every 5-7 weeks.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I pay anywhere from $15-$25 dollar for a visit (barefoot hooves, barefoot farrier) depending on how much fuel costs.    My farrier will also do shoes and they cost around $25- $35 dollars.    My arena is stonedust so it wears down the hooves. I only see the farrier every 6-10 weeks.|`|I8Tahe4Jaa	Mine just went up to $45 for a trim. My horses are barefoot so I haven't had to pay for shoes in a while, but it was about $125 for both trims and front shoes on one horse the last time I shod. I see the farrier like clockwork every 6 weeks in the summer and 8 weeks in the winter, unless there is an emergency. I saw them A LOT more when the QH had shoes and front pads. He was constantly pulling or losing shoes.    I have had a barefoot trimmer and I personally think they are a bunch of hogwash (no offense to those that use them). The average domestic riding horse doesn't run enough on hard surfaces to wear their own hooves down.  I only use a professional farrier who's gone to school and done an apprenticeship for trims now, after several lameness issues in both of my horses and several others done by the same trimmer. They need to have a strong foundation in the anatomy of the hoof and leg to do a good job, as well as an eye for symmetry. The hoof has to be a the proper angle or the horse will go lame, and I find that "barefoot trimmers" tend to leave the toe too long for my liking.    Anyone can say they can trim feet and a lot of people do with no formal training. Always check horses they trim regularly for lameness troubles and look for credentials!!  I know lots of people that trim their own to save a few bucks and boy is it ever a disaster.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	My farrier charges $25 for trims and I think $80 for shoes. I know other people are charging $35 for trims around here. My farrier came over from Montana and does a fantastic job. He explains things, takes his time, is patient with my horses, and knows his stuff. I was really lucky to find him. He comes out every two months and then more often if needed during the summer. When you go to look for a farrier try to get one that is referred to you. Having a good steady farrier is really going to help you and your horse out. Also have a good vet lined up. This could really come in handy if you have an emergency. If you have a good relationship with your vet they are more likely to work with you. Good luck and have fun with your horse. :)|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I'm in the UK and pay 15 for a trim and 35 for front shoes and rear trim.  My pony used to have a full set of natural balance shoes ( and they could never be refitted) and used to cost me 50.  He visits every 8 weeks now.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	My farrier charges $40/horse for a trim and (I think) $90/horse for shoes. He's a very good farrier, and is very good with horses. I have my farrier come out every 6-8 weeks to keep my horses' feet in great condition.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	My farrier charges 50 per full new set.    My horses are both shod front feet only, and sometimes they have the shoes re-fitted, which costs a little less. He also re-balances the hind feet each time too, included in the price.    I have the farrier see to my horses every 5 weeks.    Just to trim and re-balance the feet, my farrier charges 15, and expects to trim every 6 to 8 weeks on adverage.   Our local barefoot trimmer charges 45 to come and do a trim only, and expects to see the horse at least once a month.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I have a $10 surcharge because my farrier has to travel out. My farrier has been well educated in corrective shoes and keeps up to date on classes, clinics, etc. He mostly shoes performance horses.    New shoes (regular steel shoes on all four) is $160.  Reset is $110.  Trimming is $50.    My horse gets reset every six weeks when he's working and needs new shoes every other time (every twelve weeks) because he wears his shoes down to almost nothing.|`|AA11570905	25 for trim  45 for trim and 2 front shoes  If he comes to my house  16 for a trim if I go to his house    I have a horse with a club foot who needs trimming every four weeks so i see my farrier once a month.  The other two horses see him every 8 weeks so they go every other time.  I live in central Georgia|`|0kh2HEFMaa	$35 every 8-10 weeks for a trim, my horses are barefoot too. Make sure u get a good farrier that knows about barefoot horse trimming. Some horses grow faster, like every 6 weeks, but mine grow slow. I dont get mind shod but I believe it costs $65.|`|KVkkPqumaa	My farrier is excellent. He has his shop at our barn so he is there everyday and tells us when we need new shoes. At the moment, he is saying every 10 weeks as winter hoof growth is slower, but that goes back to 8 weeks on average in summer. A full set, guaranteed for 6 weeks is $100, half for $75 and a trim for $60. These are standard California prices. I can get cheaper, but not at the quality. None of our horses has ever gone lame after a shoeing.    I also use a protective hoof oil on her everyweek which costs about $8 per month and added a supplement to her feed which improves her coat and hoof strentgh. This costs me another $10 a month.    I hope this helps!    Oh - and make sure you get the shoes back from your horses first shoeing - nail them to a board and drill in hooks and you have a great bridle/ halter rack from your baby's first shoes!!|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	This current farrier charges $35 for a Trim and I think $90 for hot shoes. I don't put shoes on my horse, so that is about an estimate.    I have had farrier charges from $25 a Trim (back in 1999) to $50 a trim per horse (Back when I was in San Diego in 2008).    Charges are subject to change on their price due to the economy or their own personal financial gain.     In the winter, I have them on a 8 week schedule.  In the summer, sometimes a 6 to 8 week schedule to do to hooves grow faster.    I had my show horses (two out of the four I own) have shoes, if needed shoes that is,  (trail and barrels performance)  every 6 weeks.    I would not show if I felt my horse was not healthy from head to hoof.|`|jpqt4KEhaa	My farrier costs 40 for a trim and 75 for shoes. We live way out in the middle of nowhere so she charges us a traveling fee but she has five clients out here so she splits the 25 dollar fees between all of us.|`|7b6fsMFdaa	It would depend on where you live really. Different farriers charge different price's on trimming and shoeing. My farrier cost for a trim is $20.00 dollars for shoeing around $75.00 that includes labor,shoes,and the drive out. My farrier comes out about once every 9 weeks for my horses. It depends on how fast your horses feet grow. Good luck!|`|O40nuKPEaa	My farrier does a great job and he charges $45 for a trim and $130 for trim with steel shoes on all four.|`|FxJfzoFNaa	I pay $35 dollars ( that includes milage) , my farrier's wife is a pro barrel racer running in the CFR and NFR so I get a steel of a deel and he does and awsome job my horse has happy feet when roger is finished!|`|eiVWEW3aaa	well, my horse just got ice studs put on her shoes, and she has 4 shoes, they were reset too, it costs us 75$ he's like the perfect farrier, he leaves enough sole and heel so that she doesn't get lame.|`|5kUxkun3aa	my horse and pony at home are both "barefoot" they just have trims.my farrier charges 15.  another farrier comes to the yard that i work at. he also charges 15 for trims. and 65 for a full set of shoes. he charges less if he trims and puts the same shoes back on. and if he comes to do more than one he will charge less.  hope that helps.|`|AA10717561	My ferrier $25 for trim I have not had him shoed but he charges 55 to shoe all 4 hooves. This is in Iowa|`|FrqKyNdAaa	My farrier charges 25 for a trim of all four hooves.  55 for a trim and reset the front two shoes. 65 for a new set of front shoes and a trim.    Depending upon your horse's feet, it should be about 6-7 weeks in the summer but not more than 9.  In the winter you can stretch it a little to save some money to about 8-9 weeks, because they grow a little slower in the winter time.  You should also put some sort of hoof oil on them in the summer to prevent cracking.  Their hooves can become very dry with all the stamping around from flies.  It is usually available at any equine supply store and shouldn't cost more than ten to twelve dollars.  Good luck finding a great farrier, they are tough to find!
MtmpOqZ7aa	Those saddle pads are great. I have one in every color. =) I would go to walmart once they start carrying summery clothes again and pick up some polo shirts.  I used to waitress and we had to have polos that were certain shades of certain colors.  Between walmart, old navy and steve and barrys (out of business now I think) I was all set.  Lime was one of the colors that I had.  Good luck and have fun!    And like another poster said, matching leg boots for the horses is always cute too!|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Wow, I didn't know STL was still in business.     Anyway, you just look in local stores, since for hunter paces you don't have to have any special kind of shirt. Try this website, www.equestriancollections.com it often has excellent clothing along with other gear.    I also think it is cute when the horses have matching leg wraps/boots and fly earnets.|`|G8IRX295aa	oh yes, i know those pads.

BXLm8OVoaa	Moths normally hatch out in the summer, feed and hibernate in the winter. So see if he's going to hibernate and if not have a go at feeding him.  Some types of moth don't eat in their adult form, but some drink necter, or some sort of glucose or sucrose suspension in water, which can also include rotting fruit.  And don't forget, some moths will eat your jumper. Or lint in cotton to be more precise. Give him a range and see what he likes.  For a butterfly glucose solution you need  1 pound sugar  1 or 2 cans stale beer  3 mashed overripe banana  1 cup of molasses or syrup  1 cup of fruit juice  1 shot of rum  I looked after a moth without a head once and it survived for 2 weeks so there is no rush.|`|An2AopAqaa	I found a link here saying something about moths eating habbits. From what I can gather most moths don't eat. Which sounds strange to me? I dunno, have a look and see what you can come up with.     I've also posted a link for you to try and identify your moth. You ought to transfer it into a clear plastic tank, one of those with a lid and handle to carry around small rodents [:

And when movies come out with a certain dog, like 101 dalmations, everyone wants those dogs without knowing anything about them.

Definately not!!!!|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Status Symbols... got to get 1 up on the Joneses.    It's okay for a car, a purse, or shoes but It's a foolish thing to do with an animal.    DESIGNER DOGS ARE DESIGNER DUDS!!!!    I'm sorry to say that the AKC is even bending its program somewhat to accommodate all these mixed breed messes and I believe it is a HUGH mistake.    Each breed was developed for a purpose and a job.  When you start to mix up the breeds, you mix up the traits that made it great and end up with ah TON of behavioral problems!!!|`|AA10648704	You could say we have a "designer dog."  She's a chocolate lab/Weimeraner mix, but we "bought" her at the animal shelter.  It's just like when celebrities wear a certain dress--everyone thinks, "Oooh, that would look so cute on me!"  Then they get it, find out it's not right for them, and they throw it in the closet, never to be seen again.  Unfortunately, you can't do that with a dog.  I don't like it, either.  People need to do their research and find what dog matches their personality and lifestyle, not assume that the trendy dog is what they "have"  to have.|`|XFOeU1Ktaa	Because the world we live in now, when people want something they want it now.  I wanted a pug from the time I saw Milo and Otis (10ish years ago). But I did my research and didn't get one until last year when I was sure I could handle all the problems that come with one.

I know teens that just want a yorkie so they can carry it in a purse, ugh.  I will never allow my kids to have the perception of dogs.  They are learning at this young age that our breed are not for everyone and that only special families like ours can really give them what they need.    I am doing my part by raising my children to be smart in regards to dogs.|`|AA12128656	LOKI you answered EXACTLY what i was going to say!!!    people are sheep!    they also want what other people have, so that they can show that they are as great as their friend/neighbor/enemy whatever.    i think it's severely stupid, because i know that there's a dog for everyone...  people (people who love and train their dogs) tend to sort of have something in common with their chosen breed...  my friend barb has a JRT- she's hyper and yells a lot. harmless, but loud...  i have pit bulls- they're happy and silly, but don't too much like to have their space invaded.  the administrator at my work is laid back and nice, and intelligent. she's got a golden retriever.    i've seen so many bad fits with dogs who have nothing in common with their owner, either personality or energy, and it makes me wonder why people would want a dog that doesn't fit them?    oh yeah- i forgot to mention my mother in law....she has dachshunds.... draw your own conclusion....    my daughter is 6. she asked for a dog and i told her when she's 12 (i'll be caring for it with my own dogs anyway) and i asked her what she wanted, just to see what she'd say. at first she said she wanted a Chihuahua, but then she met one and said "mom, i think i'd rather have a nice gentle pit bull or a rottweiler" good choice, kid!!!|`|qioH81tiaa	Because it's easier to copy someone than to develop your own life.

Puppy's are known to get creative when they are alone.Have you thought of a puppy sitter like a dogie nursery?|`|AA12128656	these pups should be crated.   there's no question about it.   they could really hurt themselves, being allowed to roam the house without supervision!    and why do you have 2 pups so close in age?|`|Kntsw4Hdaa	Perhaps you should purchase large crates for them during the day time.  However, that should be a last resort!  Try giving them lots of toys to keep them occupied as well as fresh water.  You can also consider dog-sitters and dog-walkers that can help keep your dogs entertained while you are absent.  Call your local veterinarian's office for more suggestions. All the Best!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	You need to crate train them or shortly you will have no house left.  SInce you come home during the day, crate them in separate crates when you leave, let them out to potty and exercise at lunch and put them back in the crates again until you get home.  Believe me, I had a dog that ate through a couch, two chairs, tons of shoes, etc.. and ended up with a bowel obstruction and my vet at the time recommended crate training.  I would not raise pups any other way now.  and I have had five since then.  It may seem mean, but really it is better for them and for you.  YOu can't imagine the stuff they will get into and one may eat something poisonous or get a blockage.  My dog ate percaset once when I had surgery- climbed up on the counter and got it off the top of the fridge (a lab mix).  Trust me, it's the way to go.  And remember, it's not permanent.  It's just until they are well behaved enough to be trusted alone- we usually start letting them have gradual freedom at about 2 years old.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Dog have a tendency to do that if not contained.

Make sure the kennel isnt too big or else they might potty in it. Just big enough for them to lay and turn around in. Since theyre puppies, get 2 crates that are expandable. They might cry a little at first, but they will get over it after a few weeks.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	uhm....who has puppies and not a cage to put them in when you're not home or at night?|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I would get crates.

They may feel calmer while you are at work if they have been out already and drained some of their excess energy.|`|OxFsslN8aa	All dogs, whether large breed or small breed, need EXERCISE daily.  If you need to work and are going to keep them inside you need to exercise them before you leave them.  They are destructive because they have pent up energy and need to release that energy somehow.  As tough as it may sound, you should walk them for about a half hour - a good vigorous walk - before you leave them.  Dogs are not meant to be caged (whether by house walls or a kennel) their natural instinct is to walk continuously; like wolves in the wild.  A wolf pack will walk approximately 12 hours a day in search of food.  They also walk to mark their territory & to get a feel for what has been in their territory.  Pet dogs are no different than their wolf ancestors - they need to walk.  If you cannot take them out like they need then find a dog walker.      When you finally come home at night/evening, you need to walk them again.  Dogs need exercise, discipline & affection - in that order.  Discipline means obedience; learning the rules of the house.  Affection should always come last because the dog needs less of that then the other two (it's the human that needs the affection first).  Good luck.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Here's a good book you should read which you can download FREE:    http://dogstardaily.com-train-aft|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Darlin', you need to crate your puppies. Would you leave a baby or toddler home alone with no supervision? I hope not. Its the same concept with puppies.     A crate is not inhumane and is the safest way to keep them when you are not there. This will also help with the potty training, as dogs don't like to potty where they sleep. You can either go out and buy 1 large crate to put them both in, but as they get older you'll need two individual crates.    Any vet that will tell you to muzzle your dog when you are not home supervising them needs to rethink what they are telling their clients. Your puppy could've suffocated.     Go invest in a crate, or buy a baby gate and confine them into a bathroom or laundry room. If you confine them to a room, make sure there is no trash, cleaning products, rugs, etc for them to get into.    If you want happy, healthy, safe, and potty trained dogs you will get a crate or confine them. You don't want them ingesting something bad and coming home and finding one dead.    Otherwise, they will continue down this path of destruction and you will get so frustrated and annoyed you will end up re-homing them.    I've had too many dogs in my rescue program due to owners not knowing anything about house training and raising dogs/puppies.|`|ard3L0hHaa	Isolate them separately in crates for at least part of the day.  Go back to basic training 101.  After a while you can slowly allow them more and more time together while alone once you have given them time to be trained.  Right now they are like toddlers.  If left alone of coarse they will tear stuff up.  They don't know any better.  One other thing you can do is Puppy proof a room(the house should have already been done anyway before bringing pups home) and use baby gates to keep them in one room.  This works well if you don't like the idea of crating them.  If they are jumpers stack one on top of the other.|`|AiRtsHN7aa	hey , here is what you should do , put on ur clothes as is u will leave then leave the house and wait 5 minutes then come back again do this again and again so they will be expecting u to come every 5 minutes so they wont do anything .

What you have on your hands here is seperation anxiety, more than likely. There are several things you can try: leaving the TV or Stereo on, getting a pet sitter while your at work, getting out outside cage for them to play in, doggie prozac which you can get at any animal supply store. The best thing I did, and it is probably too late for this with you animals, but for future reference, I crated my doggie when he was a puppy. I left music on for him and I didn't make a big deal when I left or came home. When they are in that crate, you should ignore them, and when you come home or leave, don't immediately take them out, wait a few mintues....sorry dude, if its too much you may have to find them new homes, furniture is too expensive!

C1eHfhrHaa	nope- she should go to the vet right away for an exam and a vaccination round.  Most puppy contracts require a vet visit within 72 horus of bringing the puppy home to protect the breeder and the new owner.  You want to make sure that your pup is in perfect health to start her new life!|`|lmSffrNuaa	Only a veterinarian armed with your dog's complete medical history can determine which vaccines should be given and when they'll be most effective. In general, however, shots begin when your dog is four to six weeks old and will continue until she's more than 16 weeks of age.

20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Your bird needs a vet. This infection has not  "cleared" up if it keeps coming back. Smoke , cooking fumes .teflon fumes,air fresheners , scented or lead wicked candles, drafts ,paint or other strong odors will make his condition worse. Make sure you give the bird an entire course of antibiotics. If the directions say 14 days don't stop at 10 days because the bird 's symptoms are gone.Keep the water clean. Keep the bird away from the smoker. Good luck.|`|Kntsw4Hdaa	I think you should take him back to the vet as the vet may have other suggestions... Perhaps, he is getting a draft from the door which is not good for birds.  Try to keep him in a sheltered area free from drafts, cold air, smoke, and other air pollutions.  If that isn't possible, use a bird cage cover.  Make sure his food is clean and that his water is not contaminated.  Also, do NOT use Teflon-coated cooking pans/pots as they are poisonous and sometimes lethal to birds.  Hope your birdie gets well soon!|`|dXCBpetiaa	take   the bird to the vet.
uvU5DnHcaa	Firstly you must get fluids into her. Give her high water content foods like celery, cucumber, grapes and apple. Clean her eyes constantly for her with warn water on a cotton ball and take note on how quickly they crust up again. When a pig does not clean themselves it is a huge sign that something is wrong ( which you have noticed ). If you feel she needs more fluids you can give her liquid calcium and sugar water with an eye dropper. If you think she could be pregnant the calcium will be good for her. ( Most pigs that come from pet shops are usually pregnant ).   If she is still eating then she can be treated. Its when they stop eating, their system shuts down after 36 hours and then there is no hope. So give her grass and hay to keep the system moving.  The white stuff on her private area ???? Need to know if its a solid mass or can be wiped off easily. Has it been there since you got her or is it continuing to appear new each day ??   Main question is how old is she and what is her weight like ?.. is important to know to help diagnose the situation correctly. If she is an older pig, her teeth may be a problem or it could be as simple as just a mite problem.    If you are still worried after reading this, I really would suggest taking her to the vet, as they can see her as I can't.  Good Luck|`|RIVywiykaa	She may be pregnate   spend alot of time with her and hold her when she eats|`|AA10364849	If Bailey is having problems eating, drinking, or with crusts in her eyes, she needs to go to the veterinarian ASAP.     Guinea pigs can get respiratory infections, they can also have problems with vitamin C deficiency. It is hard to tell which problem she has without a proper check up.    She could be pregnant, again, a check up will help determine that. While she is at the clinic, she can be checked for mites and lice which is sadly very common at a pet store.|`|4gYQnfL7aa	i dont think you should be feeding your bananas...:S  its unlikely you bought her pregent unless she was around males at the time. take her back to where you got her from and talk to them about it.   they should check her out for you!|`|LzkSscDSaa	she could be pregnant but it seems that eye infections are quite common in guinea pigs....Spend alot of time around her and try to get her to drink or eat if she goes a long period without it, you dont want her to get dehydrated etc. I would call a local vet and ask them for their opinon being as you can never be positive because there so much that could be wrong in small animals. If you get really worried about it just call the vet and if they think its something serious just take her down and theyll check her out. she could just need eye drops, she could be pregnant etc.|`|3sB49YNnaa	She could well be pregnant but it seems like you have more serious problems on your hands.  Crusty eyes are almost always a bad sign and, in combination with abnormal behavior. is your signal that she needs to go to the vet!      Sadly, when guinea pigs get sick, it can progress very quickly so it is important that you take her in ASAP.  If it is a false alarm (which I don't think is the case), you can get the vet to check if she is pregnant, if it isn't a false alarm you will get her the help she needs
AA10029366	If the hair hasn't grown back in nearly a year, that isn't normal. Have you had her thyroid tested? A common symptom of Hypothyroidism is failure of coat to regrow. Hypothyroidism is also becoming more common in the breed.    Her coat should have re-grown by now. I'd get her checked out. If she has a health problem, no over-the-counter supplement will fix this.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	it will grow back, except directly where the scar may be.  give it time. some huskies don't even come into their natural, two layered coat, until their a couple years old.  and yours has gotten shaved.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	eventually it will grow in, it just takes time|`|zb3ImEQ6aa	There are many herbs, vitamins for hair growth in dogs. They either nourish the hair directly or support other functions that ultimately help hair grow.  but keep in mind that you should never give your dog any supplement without first consulting with your vet about safety and proper dosage.   Also there are topical ointments you can get to stimulate the hair folicules and promote new growth.  MTG and Nu-Stock are just 2 of the few you can find on JeffersPet.com to help promote hair growth. The down side to those 2  is they dont smell so good but they both work I have used both in the past on horses and dogs|`|mhaxOQ5raa	I know cats are different but it has been mos since we got her spayed her hair still hasn't grown in. that's a lot of hair to grow back all at once.

Huskies have an undercoat as well so it will take awhile before she regains her top coat in her groin area.    I suggest brushing the area and massaging it to help with the circulation and blood flow. I don't know if this will make it grow faster, but you can't lose and I know she will love it anyway!|`|wscyjkPAaa	it will grow back.  My parents have a Belgian Tervuren  (really furry)- and they shave him almost every year because it gets really hot.

px27V5N9aa	I'm assuming your pony is a stud colt.  He's acting like one!    When he gets close to you have your elbow ready to poke him hard in the nose.  He won't get headshy from this since HE bumped into YOU. He won't see it as you hitting him.    When he does bite you..turn around and 'attack' him with your fingertips into his sides.  Poke down and hard and all over his sides and back.  Growl as you do it.  Attack for 30 seconds.  When you are done, walk away calmly.  Leave him thinking he just escaped with his life and he is thankful for you sparing him.    When he gets into your space, bump him under the eye with the heel of your palm.  When he backs up, leave him go.  When he gets pushy again, bump him again with your palm.    When leading, if he starts to rear up, yank down on the lead hard, over and over and over.  When he comes down, back him up fast and then make him move his feet around (small lunging circles)   Another way is when he rears, take the end of the leadline and whack him hard right on the shoulder...then work him again.    He is at an age where he is testing you.  Do not ever feed him by hand. Don't let him get into your space.  Don't lead him by the halter (hand on the halter or up under the chin). Always lead by the line and keep a 2-3 foot distance between you and him.  When he trots up too close, a couple of sharp yanks on the line reminds him that he's too close..to back off.|`|AA10986942	Everybodys first thought is to smack him ... Not that I think this is bad but it just adds to his little game... he nips, you reach out to him and smack...he will enjoy this interaction..  What you need to do is as soon as you catch him starting to bite or when he does bite turn into a big monster!  raise both of your hands up yelling no dont you ever bite me! Even let out a big growl,  at the same time lunge toward him.  It will take him by surprise and scare him and he wont like seeing you turn into a monster.  The monster reaction should only last for 3 seconds then go right back to what you were doing.  try it, it works great.  after a few times he will figure out you turn into a monster ever time he bites and he wont like that.    It also works for a horse that kicks.  I heard this from John Lyons at a clinic and tried it on a new mare that I got that decided to try kicking  it only took 3 times and she decided to never chance bringing out the monster in me again.  Also if he is lunging at you never lead him any where without a chain run under his chin and up the oposite side snapped to the top ring on the side of his halter.  Be ready for him to do it and when he does come down hard on the chain and back him up fast for about 10 feet.  You have to be fast and firm with this because it is so dangerous.  he will learn that as long as he walks forward like a good boy he is happy but if he misbehaves you are going to bring him back into line fast.  The chain only equals out the size and strength difference between you two.  Never lead him with out it.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	When a horse does something that you don't like, imagine what would happen if he did that with another horse. WHen someone bites my horse in the field you can be sure that there will be a quick flash of my horse's teeth or a swift kick in response to the bite. You should do the same thing.     Of course I am not suggesting you beat your horse or kick him with you steel toed boots. But a swift smack to the neck, chest, or shoulder can do wonders. If that doesn't work you may need to escalate to a smack to the muzzle or a flick to the nostril.    Do to your horse what another would do to him. But, you have to respond immediately. If you wait the horse isn't gonna know why you are punishing him. Also, don't hold a grudge. Just respond to the offense and then move on.|`|AA11570905	GELD HIM!  You also need to teach him who is the dominant one.   I would carry a short whip with me, like a dressage whip and when he jumps at you give him one sharp crack with the whip.  I'm not advocating beating him.  You are doing exactly what his mother would do if he dared to treat her that way.  She would give him a sharp nip with her teeth to teach him his manners.  The whip would simulate that.      While leading, if he acts up that way give his lead rope a hard sharp tug.  If you can find a rope halter to fit him you might want to use one for a awhile.  Rope halters are great training devices for teaching young horses their manners.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Hes biting because he thinks hes in charge. When he bites you, yell out "NO!" and smack him in the neck. Be sure to do it right after he nips or else he wont know why your punishing him. Dont be afraid to use force, horses are sturdy creatures and most likely you wont hurt the little guy. Im not suggesting you beat him, just a smack to get his attention.|`|iz03uvV4aa	I have to say it - CONGRADULATIONS! Youve officially been dominated by a mini :P    Now to the serious part :)    As for a horse who bites - he bites you because he thinks, in his little mind, that he is the superior to you.  If you watch and observe how horses interact in a herd its obvious who is head of the pecking order and who is the lowest. When the lowest horse on the scale comes over to a pile of hay in which the superior horse is eating, what happenes? Well - the bigger horse lashes out one way or another by either biting or kicking right?  So what happened here is when youre leadind Colby, he is Mr. superior and youre the next horse in line.  So he tells YOU what way HE wants to go and YOURE suppose to follow.      So now that we have the interpretation down - cspiker4 has it right in the sense that you dont want to smack him.  Although this is the initial reaction of us humans what most people dont see is that a horse doesnt REALLY understand that reaction like we do.  This is not a horses langauge. Instead its ours and it last for maybe a few seconds when your horse stands back and thinks "well gee, that wasn't nice!" but infact it still remains a dominance game because ultimatley, no one has established other wise.  What you dont want to do...and please dont...is "become a scarey monster" as some horses are much more sensitive to these "heavy reactions" than others and If he is sensitive you dont want to have a horse that jumps out of his skin every time you turn around, sure this might work but ultimatley you will only creat a fear response not the "RESPECT" response that you want. This needs to be mutual.     What do I suggest? monitor this behavior very closley.  Learn to read your horse and anticipate when this behavior happens.  When it does happen, move your horse around.  A superior horse in a herd will run another horse down. This is a languge your horse will understand.  If Colby comes out and bites you, make him move around you in a circle and make him work.  What you teach him is when he disrespects you, there is work. Its much easier to be NICE than MEAN.  You dont have to run him silly and sweaty of course but it does work. You need to be on the ball though. Ultimatley you dont want this to ever happen again and when he does go to do it distract him with a task. Whether its moving over while he is tied, backing him up etc.  Another thing that works well of course is voice.  Horses will squeel at each other as a language to back off and stay out of my space.  If you notice him doing it behind your back (like when you pick out his feet) make an abrupt sound to distract him.  Even if you move your foot suddenly or say a firm "hey!".  I think you'll see some interesting differences.  Its worked in the past for me and babies Ive had in for training who come with nasty habits like biting and kicking.  I dont want to scare my horse and be "scarey" per say I want to teach them and have them respect me.  I want them to get the idea that being nice is easier than being mean or standing still is easier than moving constantly.  It seems silly maybe, but it works! :)    Good Luck! =)    I also encourage you to read up.  Fill your little brain with information, talk to trainers and learn learn learn.  Horses are the MOST facinating because you can never know everything and they are a wonderful circle of unexpected facts.  Happy Riding! :)    Sincerely,  Dallas    EDIT**  buckinfun has a great idea with the elbow. Something abrubt and so he thinks that he has bumped into you.|`|ngrjFv72aa	the reason he is doing this is because he does not respect you. i know this sounds mean but if he bites you slap him on the neck. do NOT punch him or hit him in the face, on the neck SLAP because slapping doesn't really hurt, the horse gets more startled by the noise. never reprimand him on his face because then he will get head shy. also when he bites you say NO. however if hes a baby he might just be teething so be sure to check. if he has his ears back when he bites you hes just being mean but if he seems curious he might just be, well being a baby|`|7b6fsMFdaa	His he a gelded or stud that could be one problem stud's can be dangers and can become a big problem.You could try smacking him on the nose and say really loud NO, but not to hard when he try's to bite you. You could all so try a spray bottle and when he try's to bite spray him in the face with it and say NO. Good lucky hope i help!|`|LCxSXKpQaa	The first answer was right on the money. Becareful though as not to smack your horse in the face, that only causes him to be head shy. Right now he just thinks he is the dominant one. Hand feeding your horse many treats could be the cause of this problem as well.    Hope this helps!|`|AA11606210	Great answers on here. They are exactly right.|`|ZB8f14t1aa	Many horses/ponies at that age have an oral fixation and on top of that, he is treating you like a pasture mate trying to show his "pasture mate" who he wants to be in charge and lead the pack.     Many of the answers above will help, but I might add that if he isn't gelded yet, do so ASAP, that will curb alot of "studly" behavior and always respond to the behavior as soon as he exhibits it.    - If he nips/bites at you when you are leading him, tug on the lead rope, or give him a little snap with the end of hit. Sometimes even moving your arm out in a punching manner (not that forceful though) aiming towards his neck will work, telling him "Excuse me, I am the boss and you are in my space". He may dance around the end of the lead and pull a back and as soon as he stops stop him, get back to the leading position on his near side and continue leading him.     -A small whip will help, esp. a whip called a bat, that jockeys use. It's short enough you can tuck it where he wont' see it so he wont' be expecting it when you tap him, but tap him quick with it, on his neck  hard, but not hard enough it will leave a welt; abuse isn't the answer here.    http://www.horsetackinternational.com/ba...    Don't let him chew on lead ropes or the ends of the cross ties. You  have to literally take it out of his mouth and continue grooming him or leading him. If he does it again, do the same thing. I always square my horse up in the cross ties and if they are young and want to chew & bite, I will take the cross ties out of his mouth and square them up and continue doign what I'm going. It's repetitive and sometimes turns a 15 minute grooming session into 20, but it's worth it not having a snotty pony.    I had a showmanship horse that I started out at the age of 3 and he tried to boss me around by biting me or nipping gently at me. It was not good ground manners and not good in the show ring. My friend (who was a top showmanship exhibitor in breed shows) advised me to get a little plastic fork or a "spork".Put a rubberband around your wrist and put the fork/spork under the band under your wrist. When he nips, poke him with it, just above his lips, the ends of the fork will feel strange and prickly to him. I didn't use this in the show ring, but I did this whenever I was grooming him or leading him around the barn. He stopped within a few days.     Do not give him treats by the hand until he's not biting at you and dont' have any in your pockets either.  You can give him treats in his feedbin.      Just remember anything you use, don't use it around his eyes or over his nose in a quick, angry manner, this will cause head shyness.|`|5kUxkun3aa	you need to be firm with him. in a strong voice(you know the one your mum uses when she means it) tell him NO. be consistent with what ever way you try. and don't let anyone play with their hands around his mouth. i don't know why people do it but they do.  the rearing up at you,you can lead him in a chifney bit.we use them with all the horses at the yard that play up on the lead,they soon stop it.  when my mare was a youngster she used to rear up at me because some kids used to go into her field and play with her.she got so she would come at me with her fore feet at my head height. one day i pushed her and she fell over.i felt terrible and regretted it straight away. but she never did it again.|`|AA10717561	Is he a stud or has he been gelded?

y2ywR3X9aa	I hate to say anything bad but kidney failure is not usually something a dog will recover from. My shar pei Ginger developed a form of kidney failure called amyloidosis(i think i spelled it right) and she in just a few months time went from vigorous good health to having lost 15% of her body weight, being unable to eat and then having a seizure in front of my 4 year old. I regret I let her go on for as long as I did but it was very hard to let her go. The vets wont let your dog suffer they will administer pain meds and make her comfortable but be prepared for them to tell you to let her go. You sound just like me and I know you will do what is best for your dog. If you didnt care you wouldnt seek treatment for her. Im really sorry.|`|LByD8RKoaa	that is so sad hope the best for u and your dog|`|m3NVpPpiaa	I know you love your dog as most dog owners do. I once had a dog.  My parents got him when I was 10. We was a huge part of the family and we all loved him very much. As he got older, he began to lose his sight and that was very sad. Over time he began to have hip problems and it was difficult for him walk, run, jump, etc. And then his bladder began to fail. It was sad to watch him after awhile and we knew he was suffering. We had to make a very tough choice to put him to sleep. It was hard on all of us. But sometimes we have to let go for the right reasons.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	My dog was euthanized in Aug. due to kidney failure. She never got to the point of having seizures, but I had to make the decision on that day because she fell over twice, was unable to get herself up, and had a glazed, almost panicked expression to her eyes. The vet said it was 50/50 that hospitalization and treatment would get her through the night.     When it got to the point that Autumn wasn't eating very much (about one month before she was put down) my friend warned me about seizures - her dog who had kidney failure experienced them, as did one of her friend's dogs. I am sad to say that the prognosis is not good. This is a sign of the advanced stages of the illness - the body is basically filling with toxins since the kidneys aren't able to filter them out.    I hope that you get as much time as you can with her; I think you do need to start preparing yourself for the inevitable, though.|`|vPde97E2aa	Sorry,I won't coddle you & I won't force a sick ,old, in pain animal to linger & suffer.  I take responsibility & euthanize.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	that sucks|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Our dog had kidney failure after getting an infection from a dog bite and unfortunately he died.  The vet said there was clearly something more going on than just the dog bite because his body would not fight the infection, even though he was on intravenous antibiotics for two days after the oral antibiotics didn't work.  He was only 8.  It is very difficult and I am sorry that you and your dog are going through this.  I hope your story has a happier ending.    Good luck!|`|6ypXMb1jaa	If she is not eating, it doesn't look good. Usually, once a dog ceases to eat, they are close to death. I have had two dogs die of it and they ceased eating and died within 72 hours.    If the dog is in total renal failure, it is best to let them go. I'd ask the vet if she is in total failure or if she's just have trouble because of her surgery. I'd guess at 10.5 years old she's in total failure.     I am sorry, I wish I had better news, more encouragement. The time to let her go is when she stops enjoying life. Do not let her go when you are ready, let her go when the dog is ready. It is the most selfless act a human can do for their beloved pet.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It depends on the fish species, but zero nitrate is best. Anything over about 20 ppm is problematic. At about 40 to 50 ppm fish begin to die from acute nitrate poisoning.|`|00RgkZF8aa	Up to 40 ppm is considered on the borderline of "safe" for the fish. Anything around 40 ppm will stress the fish out, anything higher will majorly stress them out, and even if the levels are super high they have a chance of dying.    I try to keep mine around 10 ppm. Just do your weekly water changes and they should be fine.|`|8A0j51F0aa	usually nothing over 20 but with fish like tetras its ok to go to 40.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Just a few years ago, it was recommended to keep them under 40 ppm.  Now, it's recommended under 20 ppm.  I would recommend shooting for under 20 ppm; under 40 ppm isn't bad, but obviously the lower the better.  Easily obtained by regular weekly partial water changes, don't over stock the tank, don't overfeed the fish, and have adequate filtration.
J7VjaHW6aa	yeah the second of third is the best to bread a ***** as this will enable her to get into the routine of her season and also help to teach her tha she cannot birth each time she is. Good Luck with the pups!!! xx|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Don't breed her. Have her spade.  Backyard breeders are responsible for pet overpopulation,  and your putting your dog and her babies at risk for money is cruel.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	or not.  get her spayed.  if you have to ask this, you don't need to breed your dog.    get her titled.  get her registered.  get her health checked.  THEN you can consider breeding her.|`|9F76AUgfaa	why don't you ask your vet?|`|OA7cPgGNaa	You should go to your vet and get an appointment to have them help you with the breeding process. It's a little more money up front but it will allow you to get more in the long run!    It's called spaying.     Unless your dog has had all her health tests passed, as a title in conformation, has something to contribute to the breed standard to improve it, have a minimum for 2k to invest in case of emergency C-section, have paper work and STD testing, you should get her fixed.    I hate to say this, but Akita's don't exactly have a great reputation. Many people are scared of Akita's, Chow's, etc. Unless your Akita also has a fantastic temperament on top of all the items listed above, you should get her fixed.    Join a breed club, get some titles, get a breed mentor, OR get her spayed.    If you come to YA about dog breeding, you shouldn't be breeding.      EDIT: Just because your "mate" has an intact male with PAPERS doesn't mean squat. Most of the time, papers are a joke.     Did you know, the just because your dog is registered doesn't mean they are PB? Many GREEDY people have a PB registered dog, it goes into heat, gets preggo by a MUTT, and they register the pups anyways.     So the fact that your mate has papers on his dog doesn't mean a single thing. Is he shown? Does he have any CH titles? Do they even know basic commands? DO tell.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Do not breed on the first heat, she is too young. Do not breed unless you have a registered dog with all health clearances completed & so has the prospective mate. Do not breed unless your dog has a comformation title to show she would be helping to contribute to the improvement of the breed. Do not breed unless you sell the puppies wiht mandatory takeback & non breeding clauses.  Do not breed if you do not know what you are doing. if all aobve is done, you can breed healthily on her 3rd, 2nd okay, but 3rd better. Did you know that with every heat (impregnanted or not) her chances of mammory cancer go up significantly?|`|yp8NtB0faa	I wouldnt mate them till there second heat.  I'm waiting for my dog to go into her 2nd heat to breed her.  It gives them a chance to fill out theyre bodies, and that way it wouldn't be difficult to give birth.|`|VaYjl71Laa	who cares.  If you want to be a moron and breed your PET quality dog that does less than nothing to better the breed, then you should do this by yourself.  You want to be a moron and breed, so you should be a moron and watch your dog either die or the pups die.  FYI how are you gonna work when you need to be.... oh thats right you're a worthless byb, why would you care about other things.      lol paper?  My golden has papers, and she is the WORST display of the breed I have ever seen.  Papers mean nothing in breeding, but you seem to be incompetent all together so why should it matter to you?  Hope your dog dies and you burn in hell.|`|5DVg6VTvaa	weight an till she is at lest 2 years most breeds should be 2 or over.that way they cope better and are mature.|`|ti8L5zryaa	If you   really love Akitas, contact an Akita rescue, and volunteer for them, after you get your dog spayed.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	don't breed. we don't need any more back yard breeders! you are not qualified to breed. if you aren't positive when you should really breed her, than you are DEF no way close to breeding. and you have a mate who's "around the corner" "with papers and stuff" that's  so.... ignorant.  Live the breeding to professional breeders who know exactly what to do. if you don't even know when to breed her, what makes you think you know how to take care of her during pregnancy and taking care of puppies finding good homes and so forth. DO NOT BREED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12128656	NEVER NEVER NEVER  breed a dog before 2 years of age.  akita is a LARGE dog. (well, extra large)    please join a breed club with her and get a mentor before deciding to breed.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	You mate is wrong.  18 months or 3rd cycle and after her health clearances have been done and you have some sort of professional opinion (preferably from dog shows) that she is conformationally excellent.  Then find a stud with the same qualities.
Net8og9Baa	Do you have an open litterbox or a covered litterbox?  If it's an open litterbox, look into getting a covered one.  They sell simple covered litterboxes at WalMart for as little as $17.    In addition to a covered litterbox for my kitten, I use Tidy Cats litter (it was cheap, but it works for me), I scoop the box EVERY day, and once a week I change out the entire thing -- dump the litter, wash the box with dish soap and water, and replace the litter.  I usually only keep the litter at about an inch deep in the box, since I change it out so often.  I haven't had any issues with smell.    As far as weight loss, your best bet is to visit a veterinarian to rule out health problems that might be contributing to her weight, and to discuss diet.  "Weight management" diets from the pet store aren't very effective -- they can put "weight management" on a can of food that's 0.5 grams of fat less than the original food, not much difference huh?  Depending on the weight and condition of your cat, the vet may recommend a prescription diet to help get the weight off of her, and then once she's lost the weight you can transition her to a specially formulated diet to maintain the weight she's at.    Good luck, and thank you for caring for an animal in need of a home.|`|AA11352641	Fresh Step clumping litter is the best there is. It's great at absorbing odor and it clumps hard so there's no urine left. Also, getting a covered litterbox makes it less gross.     As far as the weight goes, you should get a diet cat food and feed her two small meals daily which is probably what you are doing already. It's hard to get cats to lose weight because they lay around all the time. You can get some toys and a laser pointer and try to get her up and moving. Probably though you should just be happy with her not getting any fatter. :) Of course a check-up would rule out any medical cause, like underactive thyroid.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	Try Arm & Hammer Multi-Cat Clumping Cat Litter or Ever Clean Clumping Cat Litter    For Cat food You can try feeding your Cat Science Diet? Feline Adult Light Cat Food or Authority?

Also, a cover litter box is better, they have air filters in the top of them|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I use fresh step and it just turns to clay. It doesn't really smell at all. I just put alot in though. Maybe like six inches and then they just bury it all. Then when I take out their stuff I just pour a little more in. Then clean it every now and then. I use to do it all the time, but now not so much.  I would just say play a lot and cut back on the food. This is working for my sister's cat. They really don't need a lot of food to make it through a day.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	there is a certain brand of cat litter that Ive seen on a commercial that is supose to get rid of the smell ... I think its called Max Scoop or something like that! As for the weight ... dont feed her that weight management crap! Just slowly decrease the amount of food you feed her! She should only eat once or twice a day from a little bowl ... ask your vet about it!|`|nJOYHuyZaa	I know all about stinky litter boxes. I have 3 cat's...  I like the blue chrystal litter. It works wonders for controlling the odor.  I have had several of the automatic scoop litter boxes, they work great for a few months, then break. They are also very expensive!! But if you don't like to scoop, then you will like it.   As far as weight loss, you need to have her checked @ the vet. She may need a special diet & medication for a thyroid condition.  Good luck.  Edit.  Sorry, yahoo went on break & decided to cut off my answer.  Good thing I always go back & read everyones answers.|`|kW5HfnRnaa	the best litter box i ever found was the clevercat one.  its a tall litter box with a lid and the lid has a hole on top.  VERY easy to train your cat on how to use.  and when ppl come over they will ask you if you still have a cat.  you can change it every other day.  ask the vet what would be the best way to help your cat lose weight.  i give my cat iams indoor cat and she gets 1/4c twice a day.  Cause she got chunky FAST.  haha.|`|niMim3jNaa	Cat urine is the absolute WORST smell in the world, and it is SO hard to get rid of! I would say, as far as cat litter goes, do the Fresh Step stuff, or anything slightly similar. For the remaining odor, get some reallllly good airfreshener for the time being until the new kitty litter clears up the already existing smell in the air. Also, be sure you have a cat box with a roof on it, that reallly helps. Maybe put one of those air fresheners that you plug into the wall like right behind it [Glade Plug-ins, etc]. As far as the cat being overweight, I would NOT give it the kitty food, give it PLAIN dry cat food. A lot of times, kitty food and puppy food have more nutrients than CAT food and DOG food and cause them to gain more weight. Try taking the cat out quite a bit during the day if at all possible, and when it's done eating, if there is still food in the bowl, set it up on the counter until it's time to eat again. This way, it won't eat just out of boredom. And lastly, don't worry, it'll slim down eventually. Hope this helps! And best of luck!|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Just added some stuff at the bottom...    Cat litter: firstly, get in the habit of removing the solids/clumps every day.  If you do just that you shouldn't need to change the whole thing every other day.  Of course it's still a good idea to fully clean it out every now and then, but use a mild cleaner (biological washing powder, or washing up liquid) not bleach.  Litter types: Ultra clumping litters are a good budget option and liked by most cats.  Used in a deep layer and a quick scoop each day will keep it fresh.  Since you have a powerful nose ;-) a couple of options you might want to try are fistly a wood pellet litter: generally these are pine based and have a nice smell even if the 'wet' stuff is left in (your cat may not agree).  Or if you can get it/afford it 'World's Best Cat Litter' really is excellent.  I sometimes look after an entire tom, and it copes with the smell of his pee!    I would avoid non-clumping and gel crystal litters.  Non clumping (including clay based and paper) because you can't remove the pee cleanly and the smell builds up, so you do need to fully clean out every few days.  Gel because they look gross turning yellow and I think they smell foul.  I've met folks who disagree, but I think you might!    On weight: I think you might want to get her along to the vet and check you are feeding the right amount?  Some cats need amazingly small amounts to loose weight.  If you haven't been to the vet since you got her, it would probably be a good idea to get her checked out anyway.  (OK, it did occur to me... are you sure she's a she?  Being an entire male would not help the urine smell issues!)    Re the litter tray suggested below: I've used one of these. It does work pretty well on the whole.  However you do get the odd pee clump stuck to the bottom, or small bit of poo that goes through the grate.  So it really needs disasembling and a proper clean on a regular basis, which is a bit of a pain.  Also takes a bit of space/energy to roll it!  So, daily clean simpler, periodic clean more tricky: up to you!|`|sqQcLPCVaa	Although I'm not a true cat lover, we have 3 inside cats and feed another 12-15 feral cats 3 times a day.  I also had a odor problem  with one of the inside cats.  Being a senior citizen It wasn't easy  bending over all the time.  One of our neighbors recommended getting a automatic cleaning litter box.  I did some research but they were very expensive.  Finally I found one that I could afford it so far its working pretty good.  Maybe it will work for you too.

JkrVo263aa	if u have a male and a female it should be pretty easy, the female will lay about 2 eggs every week and 2 weeks later lay 2 more eggs. once there is about 8-10 eggs take them out and put them in a seperate cage. you'll need about a 10 gallon tank for them. you will need to keep them together in that tank untill they are about 4 inches long, then you can put them in the original tank, but it will need to be a big tank around 40 gallon if you plan to keep all of them|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	No. Just dip them in egg, then flour, then egg again, then seasoned bread-crumbs.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Well looking past the others stupid answers....I can tell you that they are pretty easy to breed as long as you have the rite bedding,heat and humidity.Hope i helped:)|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Mmm tasty  Breaded anole    I prefer fried anole though.|`|Y4amfu33aa	idk|`|iIGOi2Idaa	They'd probably be a bit tough to chew, I'd stick to fish varieties.

He said "well, yeah!", and the rest of us with our juvenile minds cracked up laughing.  He got it very quickly after that and recanted his previous statement, changing it to "well, I put the two rabbits in a cage and let THEM do it.".

It's keeping the eggs alive that's the problem. I tried breeding mine and every time she laid the egg (which I didn't know she did until it was too late) a cricket ate the egg. Also, you need the right kind of sand for her to bury the eggs in, otherwise, the hatched babies can't escape. Another thing, try to avoid sand from getting wet. The sand will pack tight together with moisture, also trapping the babies. Yet another thing, my male also ate the egg almost as soon as it was hatched, so they need to be monitored closely. There are many things that can go wrong. If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask me.

Actually, Bulldogs are very sensitive and should not be an outside dog.  They require a lot of extra care.  They are prone to eye problems, stomach problems, hip problems, and due to their numerous wrinkles, they need their folds kept clean and dry.  In the Florida humidity, it would be a very bad idea for you bulldog to be outide. When a dog is left outside, these health concerns are often overlooked.

rrLHU6ehaa	A dwarf gourami would be better, but you should fill out your guppy and danio schools first.  Each species should be kept in a school of at least 6.  That, of course, leaves no room for additional fish.  Angelfish can grow up to 8" long and 10" high.  10 g's would not be adequate for even one of them, even without the other fish.  Both fishes can be quite aggressive at times.  Angelfish, along with many cichlids, seem to come to recognize the person who feeds them.  Spend much time around the tank, and it seems even more pronounced.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Angel fish get too large for this tank even if kept alone.

qioH81tiaa	Ditch the harness, and put him on a normal collar.  Put the leash on, walk until it's tight, and call his name - once. Then stand there, looking away from him, until he moves.  At the moment he moves, praise him.  If he doesn't move, then gently pull on the leash to move him.  He will quickly learn that walking is the nicer option.    The harness is just allowing him to not move easier - all dogs should be taught to walk with a collar and leash, in my opinion.|`|76nTvO4iaa	How long have you had this dog?    My pom was a rescue - I got him at 9 months. He  has collapsing trachea and has to wear a harness. He acted   exactly the same way as you describe yours acting.    I suspected he had been dragged on the leash by one of his previous owners.    Week 1 - Get rid of the retractable leash.  Get a 6' light leash and hook it to his harness.  He will sit down and not budge.  Talk to him kindly and don't try to make him walk on the leash or even move.  Let him sit like that for about 5 - 10 minutes, and take him back inside.      Week 2 - Walk out to the length of the leash from him and repeat allowing him to sit, speaking kindly to him.  If he still won't move, again allow him to sit for 5-10 minutes, unleash him and take him back inside.    Week 3 - Walk out the length of the leash from him, get down on your knees, call his name & offer him a treat.  Praise him when he comes.    Week 4 - 6 Continue to work with him. He'll eventually get it and will be the prissiest walker in the neighborhood.    Be patient - It took me 6 weeks to get my Pom walking on the leash. He loves his walks now.    When he does start walking on the leash, he will occasionally sit down and refuse to move. Don't drag him. Pick him up and move him if it's a safety issue, or stoop down, call his name and get him to come to you if it's not.    When my youngest daughter left for college her first year (the middle of August), we were at the "sitting on the leash" stage. When she came home for fall break in October, he was jumping and barking when he saw the leash because he knew he was going for a walk.    Be patient and good luck!|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	I know of no trainer who endorses the use of retractable leashes, first off. The point of a leash is to tether the dog to your stride and follow your lead. Retractables allow the dog too much say in where they want to go. Until they are able to follow your commands, get a six foot leash and hold them firm. If he starts to pull, then change direction until the dog starts to follow you. When it does, then reward with a treat promptly. You are the "alpha" (or should be). Secondly, have some treats on hand. You can motivate your dog to do anything with the right motivators and persistence. After putting the harness on, give the dog a command to stand ("up" or "stand" but whatever you choose, be consistent). Have the treat ready as a motivator. As soon as the dog stands, then give the treat. Repeat as often as you can to get the desired result. Then, move to the next phase of "come." As soon as the dog responds by following you, give a treat.  As to the pulling when he sees another dog, do this: The moment you see another dog walking, pre-empt your dogs behavior by getting him to sit and look at you. Reward with a treat as soon as he does. He will begin to equate that paying attention to you is better. Over time, you will find that he pulls less and less. At which point, if you give a command to "leave it," and he does, reward with another treat. Best wishes~|`|6wSmZrrsaa	My dog hates leashes, he does something like that. Instead he'll keep walking in between my legs. I just gave up, he is great at recall now. And he will never cross the street with out me. But your dog may not be the same way so you might just pull him till he starts walking|`|vPde97E2aa	NOT "terrified"!!!  SPOILED ROTTEN!!!  Guess who's fault *that* is!!  Guess who couldn't train a fish to swim.  Guess who needs to buy a COLLAR & TRAIN & DISCIPLINE their dawg!!!|`|3p6wp7DYaa	That depends whether or not he was ever taught how to walk on a leash before. If this problem is new and just started when you got the harness, then obviously the issue is with the harness. If he's always done it, he probably never learned how to walk on leash and you need to teach him the basics.    It might be easier to start with a regular collar instead of the harness. Just put it on and let him run around the house for the day. Just make sure to take it off if you're going to crate him (choke hazard). After he  gets used to it, leash him while holding a treat near his nose. Give him the treat after he's properly leashed.     Now the key is to let him realize he can still walk even though he's got this weird thing hanging from his neck. Let him drag it around the house without interfering, just discourage chewing. After he's walked around for a few minutes, pick up the end of the leash and just follow him around. Don't try to lead him yet, you want him to learn how to walk when the leash is on. Later on, start luring him with a treat so that he will follow you around. Progress slowly and patiently, and in a couple of days he will be happily following you in great neighborhood walks.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	get a regular leash instead of a retractable one and put it on him in the house and just ignore him.  he will eventually start running around, doing his own thing and he won't even notice the leash any more.|`|wfsCSU6Aaa	Maybe put the leash on him, but dont hold it so he gets used to it being attached.  Then feed him lots of tasties till he is super fat and cute.|`|AA11305153	Don't use a harness.  That could be your first problem.    Because it's such a small dog, I would use a simple collar that goes around his neck.  Attach the leash and just let him drag it around the house for a while and get used to it.  Reward him with lots of treats for being a good boy and before you know it he will be just fine with the leash.|`|6AqFenaSaa	I would suggest using a regular leash instead of a retractable one - it sounds like he's scared it. My dog was really nervous with the retractable leash because it's so sudden and quick and sometimes makes a loud click when it retracts. Clip a regular leash on him indoors and leave him be. Don't make a fuss, just treat him like you usually do inside and give him a couple hours of walking around with it following him to get used to it. Then pick it up nonchalantly and walk him a little indoors, so he can get used to the angle and you holding it. Try this for a few days (even let him sleep with it on) and then move up to short walks. He can't stand still for days so he'll have to get used to it.    Also, after reading some other posts on here, ignore their advice about ditching the harness. A harness is much safe for your dog, especially if you have to pull the leash a little to get him to walk. With such a small dog, a collar can crush their fragile windpipe if it's tugged or met with any resistance.  Stick with the harness/ reg leash combo.|`|OxFsslN8aa	You just need to condition your dog to the leash before hooking him up.  Show him the leash, treat if you like, and wait until he is calm & submissive.  He can sense if you are nervous about his reaction so you need to be calm & assertive.  You know you are not harming him so there is no need on your part to be nervous.  After he sits calmly then hook him up (harness or collar it doesn't matter) and calmly & assertively say "lets go" then begin to walk.  Its all about starting out calm on both of your parts.  Have patients, this could take a while, but once you have gotten him and yourself calm things should go smoothly.  Good luck.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Get a control harness, the type that has a ring on the back loop where you can attach a lead.  Use a regular lead for this training.  Don't use a retractable lead until he is comfortable walking on a normal lead.    Attach the lead to the harness.  First of all, let him drag the lead around for a while. Once he's ignoring the lead, then pick the end of the lead up and gently pull. It doesn't matter if to start with he drags along the ground. As soon as he stands up, even better, takes a step forward, then praise him and give him a titbit.  Keep doing that, gentle pull, step forward, praise etc. He will be walking on the lead in no time.    He's resisting right now, because he doesn't understand what's wanted.  Dog's don't instinctively walk on the lead, they have to be taught.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	He needs to be encouraged with positive reinforcement to move forward. If you put a treat in front of him and he begins to walk, praise him and lure him with the treat. Give him the treat so the dog gets rewarded for the good behavior and walking on a leash. Continue to do this until the dog understands he will be rewarded for walking with you.    Then slowly reduce the treats so that the dog understand he will get a treat when he goes on a walk and one afterward, as long as he walks nicely.|`|dqjwpRIzaa	It's good that you have a harness, regardless the size of the dog, it's more beneficial for pet and owner.  Anyways, have you tried giving your dog a treat as you put on his leash? If not, do so. And constantly reward & praise him as you walk. It will build up his confidence and trust. Then he'll be excited to go on walks instead of dreading it. You may have to use the treats for a little while and slowly wean him off as he builds his confidence.  Also your dog may not be used to the retractable part of the leash. Make sure it's the right kind for his weight, it may be pulling him back too much (which may be what's making him nervous). If anything try a normal leash and that will tell you if it's the leash or just him being nervous.
lyhnHhuWaa	Wellness is an excellent brand choice.  Of course, you'll need to feed them according to the feeding instructions on the package.  Personally, I think the dry food is unnecessary but as long as you go with Wellness Core it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  For the wet food, be sure to get grain free.  Their grain free varieties have a yellow triangle that reads "grain free" on the label.  Yes, this food will be more satisfying to them.  It has all of the protein their bodies need so they won't find themselves hungry as soon after eating as they do with the food they're eating now.  The difference is that the foods you're feeding now are very high in carbs.  It's kind of like when we eat a lot of carbs.  They're filling, but burn off quickly leaving us hungry soon after consuming them.  The extra cost of excellent food will definitely pay off in the long run.  They'll be much healthier than they would on the junk food.      Be sure to switch gradually or they may not be willing to eat the new food.  Start by mixing 1/4 new food with 3/4 of their old food.  Gradually increase the amount of new food over the course of a week or two until they're up to all new food.  This will help to prevent stomach upset, diarrhea and food rejection that sometimes go along with a sudden change in diet.    The article linked below explains in detail why wet food is ultimately better for them.  It's a long article, but well worth reading if you're interested in maintaining long term good health for your cats.  There is also a section on commercial canned foods that offers several brand choices.  Each has a website link that you can use to find stores to purchase them.  http://catinfo.org|`|AA10859773	I have heard that cats eat less of the better foods.  But I'm not completely sure that's entirely true.    I *think* the info has gotten garbled....I think it means that cats don't need to eat as much of the better foods because they contain more nutrition (so to speak) and so their needs are met with less.  That doesn't necessarily mean they need to eat less.    But it's possible that the empty-calorie foods will leave cats hungry, much like the stereotype of Chinese food.    I'd like to make one recommendation for you which you may find more affordable - Natural Balance.  They have a duck & green pea dry food which is quite good.  It's not completely grainless but it will cost less than the three grainless brands I know of which are Evo, Wellness Core and Nature's Variety Instincts.      They also have a good line of canned foods.  I am currently feeding one cat their venison & green pea.  It's around $1 per can.  You can buy it at Petco.    Wellness is also a good line, and their canned foods are quite good.  They're around $1.35 per can.  For their dry food, I'm not crazy about anything but Core.  The others have too much grain.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	No surprise! Purina and Special Kitty are terrible quality cat foods. Wellness would be an excellent food to switch to. And you are absolutely right, they won't need to eat as much of a higher quality cat food! However, I'd stick with an all wet diet and ditch the dry, personally.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Raw Fed Cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths About Raw Feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...

Recently i had get Dry Cat food from http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c2... . I have 3 cats and they all love this food! My cats ate this food the first time I served it, no adjustment time was needed. My cats range from "very finicky" to "willing eat anything".|`|a29qiNkvaa	I just stared feed my cat quality cat food! I look at all the top brands and decide to go with solid gold! I also think taste of the wild is good but the gal that has that brand did not have any in! I would go with taste of the wild if you can find it!|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Yes cats eat less of the better foods. There is a reason too. They don't need to eat as much to get the nutrients they need.  I saw you mentioned price but what food prices don't reflect is vet bills and the odds are that if your cats eat healthy instead of crap, they will do much better and be healthier. Also my advice is not to feed dry at all. There is no reason for it   As far as brands, wellness is great and this post should give you the info to pick out good stuff.   Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...
8QatPQfRaa	Start now and the more you whistle to them the more they will pick up.  The bird may not start whistling what it learned right away. In my experience, they usually start when they think no one is watching.  My birds will whistle and chatter when looking the mirror or when I am whistling his favorite songs to him. Sometimes we whistle together.  The more you do it or play the tape, the better he will be.|`|1RGsWodYaa	Now is a good time to start. If you want him to talk it is better to try to teach him a word or two before you teach him to whistle, In my experience whistling is easier for him to do so he will whistle instead of talking.
iz03uvV4aa	Your lack of confidence is going to hurt his confidence.     As my coach would say - "Just ride him through it" Take a deep breath and make him go forward.  Just think straight ahead, be confident and ride him forward, forward, forward. Ultimatley you need to teach him that when he spooks, the lesson is going to go on.  Dont walk him afterwards or baby him just keep him going, keep him thinking and ride him through it.  The best thing to do is when you KNOW he is going to spook - change direction and change up your pattern.  For a horse like this I highly suggest keeping him BUSY and doing something different every 5 minutes.     This program my coach has me and my 4 yr old on is AMAZING. And it REALLY works for a horse who "thinks" alot and as a result, spooks!    Set out 3 sets of 2 poles and lay them at 3 points on a large working circle. As you progress on your left or right track - go over one set of poles skip the next and go over the last set.  Repeat this pattern. Go over, skip, go over, skip, go over, skip, go over etc etc.  This pattern is idea because its always different. Your horse doesnt have time to really analyze and most importantly anticipate the excersise.     Sounds like your horse is just a thinker and he is sensisitive. Just keep him busy. I think you will see a HUGE difference.    Good Luck and HAPPY RIDING!  Sincerely,  Dallas    EDIT**    Its also a great idea to REALLY use your voice. Talk to him. I know my gelding is a bit of a "sissy" so he gets worked up and I talk to him and "ride him through it" and work through it as a team.  Iam and You are a huge part of our horses performance. Some need a little more reassurance a "tough love" than others.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	I would say do a lot of ground work over the poles. First, make him walk over them a hundred times (on a lunge line) if you have to, to get him used to them. Then do it at a trot and so on. Do it until he gets to the point where its no big deal. When he just does it without even blinking an eye so to speak. Once your confident get on him, have someone hook him to a lunge line and walk you over, and then trot you over, and so on until he gets really used to that. Eventually you will be able to do it on your own. Talk to him and when he does a good job, praise him by pets and saying "good boy!" When he does a not so good job, say "heeeyyy" and start over. Just be patient, they can be stubborn sometimes!|`|I8Tahe4Jaa	You've just got to do it a lot. The more the horse trots the poles and whacks a few, the more he over reacts and you remain calm and reassure him, the quicker he'll get over it.     As for jumps, don't rush it. Work on getting a nice bond between the two of you so he learns to trust in your decisions before you leave the ground. He should be spectacular on the flat before you attempt the jumps.    As far as him refusing- I usually feel that it is morea lack of trust than fear that causes a horse to refuse. If you bump him a lot in his mouth while you're teaching him about poles and cavilletti, he want to avoid the pain. Make sure you're hands are steady before you leave the ground!    Good luck.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Your horse only acts that way with you because you're so nervous and lack confidence. He can feel that through your aids.    Try to breathe and if you get frustrated or nervous go to something that both are you are happy and comfortable doing. Then try again. If you're anticipating that he's going to spook he WILL spook. You're being defensive without realizing it and making him think there's something to be scared of.|`|7b6fsMFdaa	Maybe you could try talking to him as you ride and tell him good boy a lot. It will probable take a while for him to really trust you and feel that you are going to take care of him and keep him safe while riding. Start small with the poles and work your way up. Just try a few at once then more.
B6zl0AJDaa	I used to body clip my old QH because I worked a full time job and after work, I'd get down to the barn and work him in the dark.  He cooled out faster and dried out faster when body clipped.  BTW I rode him both English and Western.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Many people body clip their horses to make them presentable in the show ring. Yes, it does seem to be an English trend. Haha, that cause western people have enough sense not to show during the winter. JK>    A body clipped horse will also sweat less and dry more quickly after a hard ride. horses in extreme and hard training can benefit from a body clip    We also have a horse with a naturally thick coat who we clip during the summer to prevent heat stroke.    My friend Suze clips her horse in the winter for shows.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I have a pony with Cushing's Disease.  He does shed his coat in the spring, but his summer coat grows in longer and thicker than most horses' winter coats.  He also has an extremely long/thick winter coat.  I give him a full body clip about twice in the summer - usually May and August.  This winter I gave him a trace clip because my son was riding him more, and to help him deal with those 50-60 degree days we sometimes get in the winter.    Most of the horses you've seen probably are shown, or ridden a lot or ridden hard.  Clipping makes them easier to groom, easier to cool out and dry out, and they don't get as sweaty in the first place.  Personally, I wouldn't do it because I think the extra attention needed for blanketing would not offset the time saved grooming.|`|jQvT6k7raa	Horses in hard work are shaven in the winter so that the sweat dries quickly. you don't want your horse to be soaked through with sweat in 10 degree weather, do you?  It just helps the horse cool down faster, so he won't chill.    Some people body clip their horses because they show in winter, and the shaggy coat just isn't very show-worthy...however, I, personally, would not shave a horse for any reason. They grow winter coats for a reason.|`|I8Tahe4Jaa	It's so they dry out and cool off quicker if you're doing a lot of strenuous exercise to keep the horse from catching cold in the winter and over heating in the summer. It does help them look clean and tidy, but the main purpose is as I mentioned.          PRS- God also never intended for you to ride your horse, or keep him indoors, or blanket him, or trim his feet, or feed him grain or treat his wounds. There are reasons for some things to be done, mainly to keep your horse healthy and clipping hair is one of those things, especially if you ride hard and live where the weather gets below freezing.    Now, that being said, my horses are outdoors horses, and don't get ridden all that hard in the winter so I don't feel the need to clip them. However, I wouldn't suggest that anyone were wrong for doing it, especially if they need it- like in the instance of a performance horse that sweats a lot in work year round, or an Arab that is going to be running an endurance race in the dead heat of the summer and should be allowed the chance to cool out as much as possible.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I clip mine because when they are ridden in the winter they sweat up so much that it can literally take hours to get them dry again afterwards so that they can be rugged and turned out. Really I'd rather them be out in the field than standing in the stables wearing coolers and sweat rugs. They wear rugs in winter anyway so it's just a matter of needing a thicker rug to replace the clipped hair.  If they didn't sweat up ( to the point of foaming) then I wouldn't bother.|`|6GehblM3aa	I body clip my horses if they get too hot while working in the winter time because they can't cool down.  Show horses tend to be clipped so they look nicer.  My mare who is currently clipped shows a lot with me, and it makes her way easier to groom.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Body clipping is an alternative to trace clipping and it's done in the winter for horses that will be showing. You clip the horse so sweat dries and cools the horse while he's working instead of soaking the hair and staying wet for hourse in the winter.    Personally I prefer a trace clip.|`|hEXb1unraa	Some bodyclip in the winter to help horses dry quicker after strenuous workouts.......My experiences are being a show groom for many years in Arabians we pretty much bodyclipped everything that showed.....you are competing at a national level your horses better be tip top shape, then later in life as a trainer and showing AQHA at high level shows we bodyclipped everything come springtime and then blanketed, after a few weeks the coats were amazing and tight......Its done either for functionality or for showing...I also have horses that are my personal trail mounts and live outside 24/7 and I have never bodyclipped them.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	You've already gotten good answers.  Some might do it just for looks, but we've only ever done it for horses that needed it - like my friends horse who works herself up into a mega sweat - she'll be dripping even in the winter.  She needs the trace clip to be able to cool down safely.|`|unYLz0xcaa	Cause they are crazy....horse will buck you off if you try to ride them and it takes up to 3 weeks for horse to grow hair back out.  Yes it helps get rid of all their winter hair, but mother nature does help there.  If you don't want a lot of problems I would not do this.|`|nlsvqLj5aa	My horse is a clydesdale, and as you can imagine, looks like a mammoth by about October. She gets extremely warm under all that fur, and ends up sweating nearly all the time, and riding her is just impossible. So to make her more comfortable mainly, she has a full clip. It's just better for her, plus I can ride her whenever I like without her getting too hot, and therefore cut the risk of her getting a chill. It is very common in the UK.|`|7OBgjOaMaa	I body clip in November, do a trace clip in January, and body clip again in March (yes, I ride English [=). My mare gets extremely fuzzy in the winter, and if I don't it takes me 3 hours to cool her out from a good hack. I also don't like dealing with all that coat, if I can prevent it at all.  I blanket her like crazy though, so she doesn't grow a big coat, and so that she's not cold when I clip her.|`|6DCQsdyuaa	If they are showing their horses in winter then its kind of nessacary, if not, then they do it so they're horse dosen't sweat to death when doing heavy work in jumping, and stuff like that, and they want to blanket them without them sweating a lot.|`|LCxSXKpQaa	Most of the time, people body clip their show horses. It makes them look much cleaner and more polished in the show ring. Not just english horses are body clipped however, western horses are as well. I ride with an arabian show barn and every horse we take to a show, we body clip. The only ones that we dont are the ones that have shedded out nice enough to make their coat look clean and shiny.    Hope this helps!    P.S. We do not shave our horses in the winter. We let them be horses with long coats. When show season comes around around May, then we do a few weeks before the show.|`|ngrjFv72aa	I give my horse a hunters clip first and foremost because inn the winter when they have a heavy winter coat it takes only a small amount of exercise to make them start sweating and once they sweat since the coat is so long it takes an extremely long time to dry which makes him more vulnerable to  getting chilled. some more reason are:    1.For quick drying after exercise.    2.So your horse can be exercised rigorously without being uncomfortable.    3.To maintain good condition by avoiding excessive sweating.    4.Makes grooming easier.    5.Maintains a smart looking horse.|`|BIR9olyxaa	It's either for shows, or sometimes when the horse is worked hard in the winter.|`|AA10717561	for show|`|AA11570905	I do not body clip my horse, nor do I clip the hair out of his ears or off his face.  My horses are always in "pasture" condition.  I figure God made them the way they are for a reason and I see no reason to fool around with God's plan.  My horses don't wear metal shoes on their feet either.  I suppose some people body clip their show horses so they present a cleaner more polished appearance but I don't show my horses so it is not an issue with me.    If your horse grows a winter coat and then you shave it off then you need to replace it with a blanket.  It is far more labor intensive to blanket a horse 24/7 than to allow God to handle it.|`|H2gwQac6aa	horses that are in work through the winter are clipped so that their sweat drys quicker :)|`|yQFdBj3haa	In the winter horses get thicker coats, some breeds get thicker coats than others. When they are working they sweat a lot more than they would with their thinner summer coats. So they get clipped so that they don't sweat as much and they cool down quicker and they get rugged up to keep them warm when they are in their stables. Mainly it's for horses in hard work like racing, show jumping, long hacks out, etc.     I don't clip my horse because he's a 21 month old Thoroughbred, so he only has a thin winter coat and he's not in heavy work. So he doesn't need it.    There are also different kinds of clips for different reasons:    Trace clip - to allow horses to be exercised without becoming too hot.  Blanket clip - for horses in regular exercise.  Hunter clip - for horses in heavy work.  Full clip - for competition horses.    etc.|`|JDJ6ofTUaa	i think it's supposed to make them look flashy...haha

A tank that is only 1 gallon needs no filter (it's too small to cycle it anyways) but you have to change the water 100% every 3 days. A tank that is 2+ gallons but not cycled needs 100% once per week. A tank that is 5gal+ must be cycled and filtered and needs a partial (30-50%) water change once weekly.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	You wont see any sudden improvement.

You can't let her for a lil while, then all of sudden make her sleep in her own bed because she will just cry until you pick her up and put her on your bed. I would make her sleep in her own bed, especially with puppies because they are prone to have worms and you dont want that kind of bacteria in your bed.

If i saw a lawyer  who wrote  like that  in email text  of what have you i would never even think of hiring them let alone allow them to treat me in the medical field anyway. people will give you a hard time if you leave your self open in such ways.|`|AA12128656	YOU AGAIN!    get rid of the caps, and stop saying "DA"! i thought we already established that this is the internet, not "DA HOOD"    you are uneducated. lawyers and medical assistants don't say "DAT".    good god i can't even answer the question, the caps and poor grammar is too distracting.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I agree with crate training. It solves many problems    I really do hope you learn how to type and use proper English before you attend law school.    add: You do not need degrees or certifications to be able to speak, write or spell. It is taught in elementary school.  I have 2 degrees and at least 8 certification in various things. I would have not received any of those without knowing how to speak correct English, write and spell correctly.|`|hZWup7xXaa	well if you don't want to teach her to sleep on the bed than she should go straight into her own bed. i made the mistake of letting my little puppy sleep on the bed now she wont stop and she is now 120 pounds that takes up almost the whole bed lol. i would say to just put her right into her own bed when you get her. hope this helps|`|1bRRODd2aa	If you ever want to sleep in your own bed, then I suggest that you crate train her from the start.  The squeaking/howling/crying shouldn't last longer than a week, most likely a couple of nights, ignore it, and she will be happier, safer and more content when she has her -own- place.      Put the bed you've bought her into the crate with a nice warm blanket and you will end up with a happier, safer dog.      The added advantage to crate training is that potty training is a breeze...    Don't worry, she won't get jealous because the Pitt sleeps on the bed and she doesn't...    Edit: Don't worry about what she was allowed to do or where she slept before you get her.  The new rules start with you.  She probably will cry (all night) for the first couple of days, whatever you do DO NOT give in, just ignore her.  You can give her a ticking clock, or a warm pad to give her comfort, but what ever you do, do not pay any attention to her until you get up in the morning, when you take her straight outside to go pee.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Ours never grow out of it- they sleep on the beds their whole lives unless we have trouble with house breaking and then they get crated at night until they are trained.
8A0j51F0aa	the only thing to do is separate them. Take one bully out or take the victim out.

I does sound like you have 2 males and a female.  I have 2 males and a female in my goldie tank and one of the males has his breeding stars on his gills and has been pushing the female about the tank.  My fish started it after a water change.  It could also be a territorial thing especially if you've recently added a new fish.  I've had my 2 fantail goldfish for 3 yrs and got a redcap oranda a couple of weeks ago and the other two were bullying for about a day but they all get on now (thankfully).  If this does continue, you'll have to separate them as your fish could die from exhaustion or injury.
u3Hdoeiqaa	The specific reasons depend on the species... although the main reasons are preventing reproduction, health, and behaviour.    Reproduction:    Most pet species - especially dogs and cats - suffer from overpopulation (there are more pets than there are homes available). This means thousands are waiting in rescues and shelters, with thousands being destroyed every year simply for want of a home.    The ONLY way to be certain an animal will never breed is to have it neutered.  In theory, you could simply keep your pet away from the opposite sex, but this doesn't always work! Accidents happen - cats are notorious for it, dogs get loose, etc.  And what if for some reason you need to rehome your pet? You can't be certain their new owner won't breed them.    Neutering prevents more unwanted litters being born, reducing the problem of overpopulation, and reducing the number of animals euthanased every year.    Health:    In many animals, neutering has health benefits - namely preventing cancers of the reproductive system. Spaying has a much greater effect at preventing health problems in females. Neutering has some benefits, though not so many.  This is particularly important in rabbits - up to 80% of un-neutered female rabbits will get uterine (I believe - my link is broken!) cancer by the age of 3. Their lifespan should be around 5-8 years. This extremely common, fatal disease is completely prevented by spaying.    Behaviour:    In many cases spaying and neutering can reduce behavioural problems that owners don't like. It prevents phantom pregnancies and associated aggressive behaviours from female animals, prevents a lot of competitive behaviour in males, can reduce urine marking, humping, straying, etc.    This behavioural effect can also have an impact on animal welfare in terms of social housing. Rabbits are a prime example. Rabbits are a social species and need the company of their own kind. They would never naturally live alone, and they suffer when forced to do so.  However, females can be very grumpy towards eachother, two entire adult bucks will constantly fight or hump (or both), and a male and female housed together will breed. Neutering and spaying means rabbits are able to be housed socially - which is better for their welfare - without the risk of fighting or breeding.    Hope this helps!|`|AA10356572	I worked at a shelter for 5 years.. saw hundreds of animals - kittens and pups too euthanized because more were born than there were homes for...  additionally though its for health reasons - it removes the chances of some cancers    the fixed pet is also less agressive and less likely to wander    cost depends where you  live - every country every area in a country - is different|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	It's important because you don't want them to have more puppies/kittens and then have to get them euthanized because you couldn't find a loving home for them. Spaying or Neutering prevents this.|`|nWjnuYDUaa	1. It helps control the animal population. Many people end up being stuck with baby animals they can't take care of and the SPCA/ humane society gets stuck with them. By the way these organizations are supported solely by donations.     2 It stops your pets from running away. Pets try to run away to mate, or go into heat. Going into heat is uncomfortable for them, and  your female pet will get their period.     3 Spayed/nuetered pets live longer.|`|hZWup7xXaa	well one thing is it stops them from reproducing but it also helps with health issues. like if you spayed your dog than there are no chances of her getting an ovarian tumor which will kill a dog. my dog has just been diagnosed with it now i feel bad i didn't get her spayed. but there are lots of other health issues you you don't get them spayed or neutered. a lot of people find there pet isnt as playful or hyper as they use to be. the costs are different every where, like the closest vet to me charges $229 for a small female dog to get spayed where as another vet that i go to only charges $47 for the exact same operation. hope this helps :)|`|Hwybmzg5aa	hmm not shaw i think it is to keep the population low    i feel sorry for them how would you like to get your private parts chopped of and see how you like it.|`|bvrXsnRRaa	How would you like your balls getting cut off?|`|BXLm8OVoaa	Apart from the obivous:  It depends a lot on what the animal is, for example male dogs generally don't have any problems if there uneutered, but a lot of female rabbits can get uterine infections and ovarian cancers as they get older if they're not spayed.  There's not really any evidence to suggest it, but a lot of people claim that if your pet in neutered when it's older it's personality changes, but i've never had a pet neutered at a late stage i couldn't tell you if this was absolutely true or not.  Do you think you could specify?
K0uTjeWiaa	For a cat to act like this and be a house cat and not a feral, I would think this cat has been abused. It sounds like she is acting out of fear. It takes a long time for a cat to forgive and move on and a lot of patience is needed. That also means no yelling, no picking up and talking to the cat, hand feeding the cat at times and trying to get the cat to eventually come to you. Since this is your boyfriends cat, you can try and do the work needed to make this cat more trusting of you. There is a product called pet remedy that can help calm a cat.   As far as playing at night, it is normal. How about a play session before you guys go to bed to try tiring the cat out a bit. Strings and small balls of tin foil should do it   Also, learn what the tail is telling you  http://www.xmission.com/~emailbox/tailta...|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Could have rabbies...now we have to put down the cat  and your and your boyfreind      It is a good day for mankind  LOL|`|AAgX0SDcaa	You were sleeping and laying in a prone position. The cat is already mean, and when she was yelled at she took advantage of your sleep-time to try to intimidate you. She is not stupid, she knows you are scared of her.. If she were my cat I would put my foot on her (literally) every day and talk to her in a very loud voice for several minutes about who is the boss in the house. I am not saying to put pressure on her to hurt her , but to put your foot (with shoes on) on her. I did this with a cat who was intimidating everyone (dogs, cat, etc.) in the household. It worked for a couple days, she was very respectful and and then she started up again. Each day she needed a foot put on her and a forceful talking-to as a little reminder. I've done this for a rottweiller too, it seems both cats and dogs need to know who is top-dog or top-cat  in their house. It is very amusing to see a mean cat roll over on their back and put their paws up in a I-give-up-you-are-the-leader pose after doing this.|`|niMim3jNaa	Anytime an animal acts that way, you need to see if it is some kind of internal problem. I breed Shih Tzu's, and even though those are dogs and not cats, it's all kind of the same principal. When you get an animal with some kind of a temper, especially one that doesn't seem to go away, then you need to take some serious actions to fixing it because a pet is supposed to be a joy to have around, not a pain. I had a Shih Tzu for 3 years that developed a temper and got to where no one could ever touch him, something that is just very unusal for this breed of dog anyway, but we took him to training, got him nuetered, and had several check-ups, and nothing turned out to be physically wrong with him. It was just a fluke that he turned out that way. Normally cats aren't as affectionate as dogs anyway, but still, they should NOT be like that. As I said, pets are meant to be a joy, not a burden. If I were you, I'd either keep it in a crate, get rid of it [which if you have a big attachment to, don't do this], or possibly talk to a pet trainer. I'm surprised she hasn't warmed up to you though, try showing her some affection or possibly your boyfriend could let YOU be the one to give her her food, that way, she'll see you in a different light and possibly treat you differently. Nonetheless, first thing you should do is be sure the cat is healthy, so try feeling around on it for any thing that seems out of the ordinary, if it will let you do that. If not, just take it to the vet. Hope this helps!|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	your cat could be pregnant ... vets sometimes screw up on "fixing" cats! I heard many people complaining because there cat got pregnant even tho the cat  was supposedly fixed ... The best Idea is to bring her to the vet! They will be able to tell you whats wrong!|`|Hwybmzg5aa	cant train cats this is completely normal behavior.    i have one idea maybe your cat should take you to the vets and have you put to sleep ha ha ha.      peace out weirdos|`|EhOuRBpAaa	You should definitely call the vet. The cat might have some disease, like AIDS, or worse.|`|s7zx9DXLaa	It probably wasn't very helpful to yell at the cat. To the cat, she was doing nothing wrong, and got shouted at (unpleasant for a highly-strung creature with sensitive hearing) for no reason.  if her temperament is usually quite angry and aggressive, then thats not unusual, but i would suggest going to see the vet, to see if something like an injury or illness is fueling her behavior.|`|HueYn2Dgaa	If she  is really acting differently and violent have the vet check for rabies!|`|ykUFSBrBaa	no not really , you should just go to the docters office to get it fixed.

In Ireland or are you importing the dog from Ireland?    If you are in Ireland, the Red Mills dog foods would be a good start, if not, then try the Burns dog food, they are only available from vets though, but it is a very good food.    OK, I re-read your question - you want the food to be available  in Ireland, so my suggestion stands...    Of the more readily available brands, Royal Canine is better than Science Diet and both are better than your generic Pedigree Chum etc.  If you do want to go for a supermarket available brand, then go for Butchers rather than any of the others...  Whatever you do do NOT follow the feeding guidelines on the packets, the suggested volumes are far too much, feed half to two thirds of the suggested volumes and you should end up with a healthy weight dog.|`|2IA3Pdr8aa	i would suggest Puppy Hills Science Diet. Science Diet is a wonderful brand of dog and cat food. it gives your pet silky fur, and its the most healthy food you could possibly provide for your pet. its expensive, but its worth it to keep your og as healthy as possible. as soon as your dog turns 1 year old, then you should move to adult food.|`|ZaPFztGJaa	I would suggest making your own dog food.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Spring Water can be used, but it depends on their source. Some Spring Water is virtually identical to tap water anyway, others may have other minerals and vitamins added which are not ideal for fish. It also will be costing you unnecessary money buying endless bottles of water.    It's perfectly fine to use dechlorinated tap water (provided it's straight off the mains and not from a storage tank like hot water and bathroom water often is).|`|SOxdyWQOaa	spring water is great for them|`|tShDXmgbaa	Spring water is the best!|`|STPmyVw5aa	Truthfull...

It was just a little under $4.00 for the bottle, and it's lasted almost 5 months so far with plenty left over. You may wish to try this route, if you would like a cost-effective and beta friendly water supply.|`|BMri9tITaa	I used to use spring water on my betta.  He loved it.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Lights should never be left on 24/7, fish need a dark period the same of any of us to rest. Lights can also cause algae problems. If you're doing this it will lend towards the cloudyness. Feed once a day for now.    Feed every other day, for the reason your tank is actually fairly overstocked with fish that still have growing to do and are HUGE waste producers!    The Iridescent Sharks are tropical fish that should get around 3ft long, they're really meant for the food market NOT as pets. To be kept you're going to need at least an 8ftx2ftx2ft tank or larger!! Rehome them while they're still only 3", once they get any larger, noone will want them.    What kind of Pleco do you have? These are also tropical fish, not coldwater like the Goldfish, some Plecos will stay 5", some will get over 12"-24". They are massive waste producers.    Goldfish like your Shubs are best in ponds and should get around 12" or larger not including the fins. They are coldwater and, as I have already mentioned, big poop machines.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	everyone is different I feed my fish once a day and there happy and the light thing 12hours on 12 hours off will work and yes it can effect them      17 years experience with fish|`|tShDXmgbaa	You can feed the fish once a day,twice a day or every other day.  Its not how often you feed but the amount you feed per feeding. A tank of this size should not be getting cloudy unless you are overfeeding the fish.  You should never leave your tank light on 24/7.  This will just cause your tank to start growning algae and this could also cause you tank to start going cloudy.|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Once a everyday is good...

The fish feel more protected.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Feed once or twice a day, no more than the fish will eat in five minutes.    Don't leave the light on all the time.

Just give them enough that they will eat up within a minute at a time. If you leave the light on 24 hours a day your tank will build up algae and your fish might become irritable.|`|AA10425091	1 time per day and at same time if possible.. you really need to turn your light off sometimes..|`|LNH3ZbsCaa	I've had my fancy goldfish for 3 yrs and have fed them twice a day.  In the morning and then again later in the evening.  I prefer to feed my fish gel food (which I make myself) and I also give them peas at least once a week to stop them from getting constipation or swim bladder.  Also too much food could be the cause of your water being cloudy.  How often do you do a water change and do you test the water?    I wouldn't leave the light on 24/7.  Between 8 - 12hrs is more than enough.  Too much light is only going to give you a build up of algae.|`|pK7saLw4aa	you should only have the light on during the day, and your tank is cloudy maybe because you haven't cleaned it. You should clean your tank EVERY week. Then your fish won't get sick as esaily, trust me i know.|`|8A0j51F0aa	its ok to give fish 1 meal a day as they do not burn energy like people do. I would go with no more than twice a day but only once would be better. Never leave your light on 24/7 because this will cause an algae bloom plus your fish will not enjoy constant light as it needs darkness to rest or sleep.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Turn on the light 10 minutes after you wake up ( I turn mine on at 6:00 A.M. and feed them at 6:30 a.m. and then i feed them again after my dinner which is at 6:00-7:00 P.M.). Just feed them once or twice a day and its alright if you miss a day or two because they can scavenge for food and help clean the tank.  Also when you are feeding, crumble the food into small pieces so they can be easily consumed, then wait 2 minutes and take out any uneaten food.  the reason why the water is cloudy is probably becuase you are overfeeding the fish, also is the tank new? it may take a while for everything to settle down if it is a new tank.  You should get some more fake plants, it really adds to the aquariums feel and get 2-3 more small decorations for the tank.  I love a tank that looks happy and realistic!  Well anyway, good luck!!

LzkSscDSaa	Well heres a few ideas for you....They sell zebra print stencils at micheals, jo anns crafts, any craft store really. You could paint your entire room white then use the zebra stencil in black and that will leave off the zebra print for you, or you could just do it to your dresser, tv stand, entertainment center, closet door end tables. or you could do your room just a plain color and get zebra printed accesories like, bed spread, rug, curtains....and if you really want your walls a zebra print, then i recommend the stencil idea because that would come out best but they always sell wallpaper.....??    Hope that helped ^^    -Ashley_NoWaR*|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Got nothing to do with pets, but hey, I love both purple and zebra ;).

mg3DzHwFaa	Take your pup outside immediately after he wakes and after he eats. Make sure you stay out with him and encourage him to move around a bit. Stay outside until he goes. It will take time and patience.  Think of it as having a toddler; never let him out of your sight. Praise and perhaps offer a small treat when he goes potty outside. Don't be surprised if when you think he is all trained that he regresses for a while and has some accidents in the house. This often happens. Just be patient and keep rewarding when he does well.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Get a crate that can grow with him. It's important to make sure there isn't enough room in the crate for a potty area and a sleeping area. There should be only enough room for the pup to turn around. Put him in there while you are sleeping and while the pup is home alone. All other times, keep him close to you (preferably on a leash) and take him outside at scheduled intervals to potty. When he goes outside, give lots of praise and treats! When he has accident inside, try not to bring attention to it. Soon he will be potty trained!!!|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Depends, if it's outdoor, continuously keep taking the puppy out every hour or two so it knows. Signs that it's about to piss or poop on the floor: circling, sniffing, and scratching the floor.

nr9mD871aa	The poster above me is completely incorrect. A swim bladder is an organ that regulates how they can stay down in the water. When a fish has a swimbladder problem they simply go in circles at the top or just float up to the top and die. I'd have to say the poster above me is rude and quite the as they said "bozo"
j2yhjBDiaa	Oh god, that's awful! Poor thing! You should take it to the vet ASAP, but unfortunately there may not be anything they can do except put it out of it's misery. That sucks, I know, but you don't want the little guy suffering...|`|pK7saLw4aa	Your hamster possibly broke something, you should take it to the exotic vet immediatly! good luck!|`|AA11305153	I'm so sorry to hear about your hamster.  Unfortunately there isn't going to be much anyone can do for it.  The poor thing probably broke something in its hind half.  Goodluck finding a vet.  There aren't many that specialize in hamsters, and even fewer that will try to fix a fractured bone.    Take it to your local pet store and they will gently put it out of its misery and you can buy another one.
AA10029366	Yes, please. As well as her elbows and her thyroid.    And it would be great if you could get her hunting title and a conformation title, as well, just to prove that by breeding her you're actually contributing something to the breed, rather than simply making more poorly bred Labradors.    Do we really need more poorly bred Labradors?

What if she didn't know how to care for the puppies and ignored them, leaving you to feed 6 - 12 puppies every 2 hours!?

QVP8zSuWaa	All dogs will be loyal, I have seen dogs that have been beat still be faithful/loyal. Thats one of the great things about dogs|`|6ypXMb1jaa	All dogs are faithful.    Siberian Husky's have a great sense of independence though and you may have a hard time containing the dog in a yard or smaller area.    They demand constant and vigorous exercise, but that does not mean they aren't faithful animals. All dogs are LOYAL, which I think is what you want. I simply don't care for Siberian Huskies because they are escape artists. But, they are a good for someone, just not me.     Rotties are loyal and sweet and aren't as high energy. They are a good protective canine when well trained and socialized. They have drawbacks in the health department such as hip dysplasia and cancer, but they are sweet dogs when a person takes the time to show them the ropes (train) and spend time with them.|`|AA10029366	In terms of sticking around you and caring what you think?

If I had the choose between a Husky and a Rottie, I would definately go for the Rottie but that's only because they fit my lifestyle and what im looking for in a dog.

AA10029366	There is no reason to put a Siberian husky in a harness, unless you actually want it to pull something.    Put her on a regular leash and a collar. Encourage her to walk using a happy voice, or luring with an especially good treat if necessary. Praise and encourage her every step of the way -- especially since she isn't too crazy about you to begin with.    If she was left with her litter until 13 weeks old and not socialized by her breeder, her behavior is normal. She will warm up. I HIGHLY recommend getting her into a Puppy Kindergarten class to help get her socialized.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Hi, first of all, yes a normal collar will do just fine.  You only got her yesterday, so remember everything is new to her, and she was probably one of the more submissive puppies. Give her time to adjust. Don't try to make her walk with the leash the first day. Sit on the floor, have a few toys with you, and just ply by yourself. Don't even look at her. Just play, make funny sounds, lie on your side. Not long and she will come to investigate. When she comes, don't stretch out your hand to touch her. Let her come to you. Take time in doing this. She will soon accept you as part of her new pack.    There are so many things to teach a puppy. Start with housetraining, sit and down. To teach her to walk on the leash, first put it on and just leave her. She won't sit still forever. She will get used to it. And her eating habits will improve as she gets used to her new environment.  Please read the articles on my website and blog for training tips.|`|OxFsslN8aa	A dog will not live in the past.  Dogs live in the present, always.  They will recall things when a certain smell reminds them of something but they do not pine for the past.  If she lived in a pack then there was a pack leader & she had someone to follow.  Who is the pack leader for her now?  It could be that to her no one is taking on that role & she doesn't know how to behave.  Put a leash on her & walk her around (lead her).  During this walk you don't have to talk to her because she learns from smells.  Allow her to get to know her environment one room at a time with you.  Be calm & assertive during the walk & teach her that you are the leader.  Also, a good long walk outside with you leading her will help her get to know her territory & make her more at ease.  Think of wolves & how they behave (dogs are not far from their ancestors).  Good luck.

YOU ***MADE**** them "picky" & spoiled rotten-can you STOP????|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Nutro isn't that great a dog food, really. I'd try a higher quality one.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Raw Fed Dogs)  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/ (Raw Meaty Bones)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs. BARF Diet)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths About Raw Feeding)    Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...

Most dogs bark out of boredom.  Do you exercise your dog sufficiently for the breed?  Being in the backyard is not exercise.  A mastiff needs to walk/run for about three hours everyday.  It doesn't' have to be all at once but throughout the day your dog needs to release it's pent up energy.  Dogs need exercise, discipline (rules, boundaries & limitations) and affection - in that order - everyday.|`|8eSbCrQraa	I feel your pain.  If ours sees a leaf blowing in someone elses lawn, she goes nuts. Im not even kidding.  Im going to be honest, there is no quick fix and it takes a lot of effort on the trainers part.  We have resigned to either saying "oops!" and pulling her away from what she wants to look at EVERY TIME she barks.  You can also try say "AH AH!" and tapping her side to get her attention.  That does nothing for our dog though....    So after a week of constantly pulling her away (a leash may be easier) she is finally settling.  Its a pain in the butt, I know. Its the only thing thats worked for her crazy barking.
McnuekTBaa	Snakes, especially little ones, tend to dehydrate quickly when they are loose in the house, and will therefore seek out a moist hiding place. That is why escaped snakes are often recovered from bathrooms or piles of laundry.  Set a few damp towels in strategic locations along walls. If the snake encounters one, it is likely to stay put for a while.  Baiting it with food, or with a heat lamp, will probably not work.  I also recommend that you buy an actual snake cage. Many dealers are on kingsnake.com.  Aquariums with removable tops aren't escape proof.|`|WJrznvvRaa	try this it might sound abit crule but staple or nail a dead mouse to a bit of wood leave in the room it will be atracted to it and hopefully you will find ya snake the only other thing is to look in and out of every thing hope you havent got floor boards it could get under them good luck|`|1KHXv5hkaa	I'm going to play the "I hate you" card here.

So look behind cabinets, fridges, under floorboards, in the walls etc, if the dark place has a source of heat, like an airing cupboard, even better.    I've never heard of a way of "luring" a snake.  You could try a live mouse in a cage that the snake couldn't get into, but it would be very cruel on the poor mouse! Then keep watch on the cage, especially at night...|`|HWtG9dkzaa	That's a difficult one - as he could be anywhere - he may have even got into the wall space or under the floorboards.    I'm not sure what to suggest - other then the fact will want to look under everything and behind everything - as he maybe curled up somewhere and sleeping.|`|5DVg6VTvaa	put a hot water bottle in the middle of the room an turn the lights of and weight it dose work the heat will attract him.
ArBOK95aaa	yes.  it is lower quality, full of carbohydrates, and they market the daylights out of it so you think there is actually a reason for you to buy it.    your cat has absolutely no nutritional requirements that would require an "indoor" formula food.  It isn't like your cat morphs into some other type of creature other than an obligate carnivore.    To read more about feline nutrition, check out http://www.catinfo.org a website run by a vet who actually studied feline nutrition - most vets don't.  basically she says that all cats need high protein, high moisture, low to no carbs.  Either a raw diet or a high quality canned diet are ideal.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	I was using Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula and I switched to Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul.  He would quite often throw up his food and eat it again with Purina but on the Chicken soup brand he very rarely does this.  Good Luck.|`|FOLjr8G9aa	I didn't even know there was such a thing and I am obsessed with cats. I simply use iams digestive care. my cat is fat and it helps him poop and stay skinny. also I think it helps him get rid of hairballs. ya I have no idea if there is a difference, but I doubt it.  Piper|`|60mDEusiaa	Well, I think it helps in the digestion of hairballs. My boyfriend's cat is an indoor cat, and it helps him. He always was coughing up hairballs, now it's not as much.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	My cat was an indoor and ate the usual food, but remember to give some grass grown in a tray! you can buy this at the pet shop,they sell it just for indoor cats! this is important for their digestion.good luck.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Yes, but it's not a good one. You don't need an indoor or an outdoor formula. All you need is a high quality, wet cat food.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Raw Fed Cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths About Raw Feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  |`|EEgZsmRxaa	I believe the outdoor cat food has more protein and vitamins for active cats since they're going to be running around outside.

fWf3A3Ioaa	The same way you'd clip any birds wings - only these will be easier because they're larger and easier to manipulate.    At 5 months I'm wonder if they are even fully flighted (flight feathers grown in) yet?  If they are, you can clip them now - but just be aware that for species like mallards and other quick fliers they usually recommend pinioning the bird at a young age (prevents the flight feathers from ever growing, basically, like declawing a cat only de-flighting).

Birds aren't "pregnant" by the way, she may lay eggs and if there is a male present the eggs will hopefully be fertile and you might get chicks hopefully.     Best of luck.
djmqoFSTaa	I take mine to the local carwash...hang them up on the "rug and floormat" hooks in the wash bay...and spray them.    I wet them, change to the wash...soap them to death, then rinse and rinse and rinse.  The power from the wand...will remove EVERYTHING that is stuck to them.  Hair, sweat, poop, urine, dirt, mud...you name it...it comes off.    Then...I actually use the wax cycle when they are all done.    Costs me about 5-6 bucks to do 3 of them.  Then bring them home to hang over a fence to dry.  Once they are dry...I can respray them with 'waterproofing' that comes in a can...if needed.    I don't like dryers...they shrink some materials and the horse blanket could end up all warped looking...or not fitting at all.  **Learned that one the hard way**|`|H2gwQac6aa	exactly the same as lexey lol :)|`|cGRyDCpQaa	What we do is we take it out on the driveway, power wash it and scrub it with a car brush, then take it to the laundromat and put it in the giant washer. We put them in the dryer for extra long.    If we just throw it in the wash it never comes clean. We power wash it to get most of the grunge off first.    Our smaller blankets usually don't get as dirty and fit in our own washer and dryer so we just wash those at home just like clothes. We use warm water for all our blankets and never had to waterproof them.    Be careful taking the blankets in though - we have to smuggle ours in, lol. I know a lot of people who've been kicked out of several laundromats for washing/drying horse blankets in them.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I typically wash my by hand. I soap em up when I know it is going to rain and let nature take care of the rinsing. When I do take them to the laundromat I typically wash them in cold water and I never ever ever put them in the dryer. I stick them in a trash bag for transport and then hang them out to dry in over a fence. You can re-waterproof the seams using spray on water proofing agents.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	I'm a brat and I make a horse blanket washer do it for me hahaha :P But that's only because my mom refuses to let me use her washing machine!!!!!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Wash them twice. The first time you wash don't use any detergent unless you get some Oxi Clean (awesome for odors). This will help loosen up a lot of the dirt, hair, etc. Wash it again with detergent, just make sure it's rinsed. You will need to use the biggest washers available. You can put a couple sheets, a sheet and a medium weight or one heavy weight blanket into the wash. Don't try to stuff the washer full because your blankets won't come clean.    Always use cold water as it's safe for all materials. I hardly ever put my blankets in the dryer. Because most of the shells are nylon high heat can damage them. Bring them home wet and hang them up to dry and if you must put them in the dryer put them in on medium or low just long enough that they're damp instead of dripping wet.    Just so you know most laundromats are not happy about horse blankets comes in because of the dirt, hair and manure. You may need to be sneaky and be considerate and take the time to wrap the buckles and metal pieces up with a piece of sock held on with vet wrap. That will keep the metal from beating up the inside of the equipment.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	I hang mine up and use a hose to wet them down the scrub them with a brush. it works great. You cant wash off the waterproofing either. Then I just hang them in the sun to dry on a warm day.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I take mine to the local feed shop and she sends them off to the rug washers. They wash and reproof and can do any necessary repairs.  I have gheard of people washing turnout rugs at home but mine are huge and either wouldn't fit or would be so tightly packed that they wouldn't come clean anyway.    If the rugs are "not bad" I'll wait till the weather gets better and then throw them over the gate and give them a good jet washing.  Coolers and the smaller stable rugs I usually put in my washing machine at home.    You can usually buy re-proofing spray at a good tack shop. Or Google Nikwax ( I think they do one that you can wash in ......)|`|RJdWIHR7aa	go to a laundrette they know how to do it for about 4 its cheap and easy.|`|sbuNcsIwaa	if they are very thick it is probly not the best ideak to put them in the wash unless its the only possablity, hand washing would be the best.     if you have to though make a load with only the blanket and use cold water.|`|AA10175424	I brought the large front loader washing machine and do my own blankets. Wash in warm water, yes you can put them in the dryer but the noise will drive you nuts.  I use scotch guard for water repelling.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Have a professional wash it. It's not that expensive.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	I actually wash mine at home.. it would work better in a bigger laundromat washer, but I don't feel like going :P    I don't know what's proper, but I just do warm water, and if you can, add detergent first and put the blanket in once the water has a chance to mix in the detergent.  wash blanket, spin dry, and hang up to air dry.  At home, I have to run it on a rinse cycle again after the wash since the washer is smaller it doesn't get all of the soap out the first time.  I don't think you ever want to put things with a lot of stuffing in them in the dryer (goes for bed comforters and sleeping bags and such too - it clumps up the stuffing.    If they are really really gross, weather permitting, I will spray them with a hose with a spray nozzle on first to try to knock out some of the dirt and poo and hair so it won't clog the washer.    I also buy a can of nikwax/minwax whatever that waterproofing stuff is, and just spray down the blanket.  You'll use a whole can doing just one blanket.    Edit:  one final tip... I bought a thin blanket to use as a liner (it's just a sheet.  you can buy them in fleece too).  It goes on under his heavy blanket.  Since it's a lot thinner, it's easy to chuck that in my washer at home.  I was it several times during the winter but don't wash his thick blanket until winter is over and I can hose it off first.  You can brush his blanket with a body brush to get mud off.  Sometimes I have to wash his big blanket mid winter because he poos on it though :P

Tokay geckos make good diplay reptiles but not for handling. I hav one and he's bitten me too many times to count.

GT6396BDaa	Personally, I think that people convicted of animal cruelty often get off very easy, such as a fine or probation.  I think they should be given harsher punishment, because when they tortured an animal, they didn't care what they put them through, and how much they suffered.    You can do a search online, for animal cruelty cases in your state and nationwide, to read about what the people did to the animals and what they received as punishment.  You could also look up the ASPCA and contact them for any news articles, research and information they have regarding this subject.   People who are cruel and torture animals should be punished in a way that makes them suffer.  Best of luck on your research and English paper.

Just to b on the safe side u should put a baby beardie on newspaper or papertowels. Or even reptile carpet. When it gets about 10 inches long or so u can hav sand in there so it looks nice.

I switched to sand when mine was about a year old as the sand goes through the digestive system no problem when they are older.|`|8WxwwDR1aa	i have 2 beardies and from what i know play sand is okay but calcium sand rots their gut and all mine are okay even the vet said play sand was okay just not calcium sand. x|`|FmGcqrCDaa	this is why in the wild they have a lifespan of only 3-6years, in captivity they live for 10++++ years.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	nope they dont live on large amounts of sand in the wild it mainly something like baked clay kinda stuff somtimes will a little bit of sand dirt or something on top but not all deserts are like the sarhara and all sandy. they can get impacted from things like sand which is very bad. lots of people i know keep there beardies on things like tiles large flat rocks which i guess is natural for beardies and other keep them on newspaper kitchen roll repti carpet and lino. so sand isnt natural for them at all really|`|Xv7p7nRKaa	I used to keep my bearded dragon on sand, but actually found that it was much harder to clean out and stuff. He now lives on kitchen roll and i find it much cleaner and he prefers that to the sand.    I also found he wouldnt eat his food because of the sand so he wasnt growing properly. I agree with what has already been said about their natural habitat.     Personally i think it would be better to either use newspaper, kitchen roll or reptile carpet (although i have never used this, i think it would start smelling after a while cos of the wee and poo produced by the dragon)    Hope this helps you.|`|SjQV7CyLaa	They are from dry, arid regions yes, but they are far more likely to spend their time on rocks and dry shrub land rather than actual sand. Deserts aren't only just sand, you know.  Keeping a SMALL captive bearded dragon on sand will eventually cause impaction, I realise there are people who have kept them on them with no ill effects, and I keep only my largest beardies on sand (and I mean big, like 20 inches +)  Newspaper is non toxic, easy to replace, and of abundance. It makes a good substrate.  A certain degree of naturalism is required for the captive care of reptiles, but availability and practicability are also factors. Would you rather keep your animal on newspaper and it look unappealing, or on sand and it be dead?    ETA: calcium sand.  Calcium sand is bad because it encourages the bearded dragon to ingest the sand to make use of the calcium in it. Therefore it is inevitable that the beardie will become impacted. Calcium sand is not a substitute for properly gut loading and dusting food items. It will not, however, rot a bearded dragons gut, I assure you.|`|5DVg6VTvaa	just buy sand with calcium in it most petshops sell it
ZB0VuKh8aa	Yes, this kind of thing happens sometimes.  Happened to a friend of mine twice (not same mare!) with absolutely no problems.  Although it is inadviseable problems usually only happen when there is a genetic defect in the bloodline which is magnified by the in-breeding, so you will probably have a lovely healthy foal.  Hope you are better now, by the way!|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	It may or may not. Sometimes there are genes that don't do any harm if the horse is only carrying one but if a foal gets that same gene from both parents it can cause a genetic defect to show up.  Also, if the mare has inferior qualities that she's passed on to the foal then the foal and her together could magnify these inferior qualities in a foal.  On the same token, if they are both carrying good qualities those could be magnified in the foal as well.  You will probably be okay but you won't really know for sure until a foal is born or until it gets a little age on it.    Usually a colt or a filly reaches puberty at around a year old, sometimes younger and sometimes older, so you're always running a risk of a colt breeding something if they run with a filly or mare when they're getting a little older like that.
B6zl0AJDaa	ow do you mean "Cribbing" as in chewing wood in stalls or paddocks?  Or do you mean "Wind Sucking" as in grabbing a hold of a board, piece of metal pipe or anything else a horse can get their teeth onto and sucking in air?    The two seem to get confused a LOT lately.    For cribbing, you can normally paint the stall with products from creosote to products designed specifcally for horses like "chew stop", etc.    As for wind sucking, most horses will do it LESS if turned out for longer periods of time or out in pasture with other horses.  When you have a wind sucker, you have to watch them regularly because they suck air into their stomach for that endorphin high and colic easier.  I've had lots of other horses with this gelding and none have ever offered to try wind sucking, so it's an old wives tale that they teach other horses how to do it.  You can try the collars but a died in the wool wind sucker will figure out a way around the collar.    One of my former students had a gelding who did this years ago and she noticed her now 6yr old TB mare starting it and asked the vet and did some research on her own and this is what she came up with.      "I did some research and talked to my vet. Both sources revealed that the behavior indicates the presence of ulcers! (I had no idea horses could get ulcers.) The vet also checked her teeth and determined that they needed to be floated, which was done. In fact, that was the first thing the vet suggested, saying that the chewing behavior is common in horses that need their teeth floated. The ulcers probably came about because she couldn't chew her food properly. I chose not to get ulcer medication, but instead feed an extra flake of Timothy Hay every evening. The vet confirmed that would help the condition, and also cautioned against sugary feed.    I'm happy to report that my mare is no longer chewing down her stall, and I've witnessed no more signs of windsucking. Now keep in mind that action was taken as soon as the signs were noticed. I don't believe she had time to get physically addicted. Still, I watch for signs, and continue to feed her extra Timothy. "    It's NOT the end of the world.    BTW Creosote works the best to paint wood with.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Provided that he is truly cribbing, and not just eating wood, here is an article (short) on the latest research findings on the cause and best treatment, which is to change his habitat.................  http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...    Here are the findings of earlier research.  Scroll down to where it specifically addresses cribbing, and it will help you to determine for sure that your horse is cribbing, and also will address the inappropriateness of common "cures".  Also, it differentiates between simple chewing of wood (and how to deal with it) and the windsucking nature of cribbing.  It also points out that very little air is actually swallowed, and colics attributed to cribbing are likely to be associated with ulcers which are often present in the stomachs of cribbers.  Also note that the recommendation is often to allow the cribbing to continue, but provide rubber cribbing boards to chew on instead of wood.  And, if ulcers are found to be present, treating the ulcers will help the horse, but not stop the cribbing.    http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx...    Don't paint the wood with creosote, which cribbers ingest when they still bite on the wood, and is highly toxic. I know of no one in this area still using creosote on their fences or stalls. Here is an article on the toxic effects of creosote.................    http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index....|`|px27V5N9aa	Well..if he's chewing on wood, paint the wood areas with 'chew stop'.  You can also line the top of rails with a strand of wire/aluminum strip.    For cribbing (the true wind sucking crib) you can try turning out 24/7 but if he's already got 'addicted' then he'll find a spot out in the field to crib on (fence post, another horses withers, a tree).  If that is the case, a crib collar.    The old fashioned 'nut cracker' kind always work wonders.  The miracle collar but my friends horse could crib with it on. Maybe they didn't have it on right though. :)|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Cribbing collars do work. My trainer has two cribbers and they both wear collars so they don't crib.

He is a busy horse and he gets VERY VERY board.  As a result he chews on everything but he also wind sucks sometimes. I noticed a little drop in his weight and through the concern of that and the owner of the farm where I board I got him a cribbing collar and its done wonders!  Good news is, this is manageable!    Good Luck :)|`|unYLz0xcaa	Try a couple of things...stall toys are always helpful. They are like big kids and need something to do with their spare time.   Vinegar pour it on to the wood, that might work it won't taste too good.  It won't hurt the horse.  If you don't have a lot of money for stall toys try a gal. milk jug pour some sweet feed or cut up apples into it or carrots.  This should be hrs. of fun for horse. Also if horse is stall walking put bale of hay in stall with out the strings on it.  I've always heard you can put gravel into a milk jug and hang it up in a stall, they like to make things rattle. You can cut out the top of the jug some not alot and make horse work for it's treats if you use the treat idea.|`|FxJfzoFNaa	The miracle collar its awsome make sure you get the fleece pads that go with it or else it does rub, My gelding is an ex racer and has the WORST!!! windsucking/cribbing problem I have ever seen, the miracle collar cured him!! they can eat with it on and you can also ride with it on if need be it only ads pressure when the crib unlike other cribbing collars.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	If the horse sucks in air, a cribbing collar (the miracle collar kind, that is made of leather and has two straps - one goes in front of the ears, one behind) works pretty well.  It takes all the fun out of it when they can't suck the air in, so they do it less.    For very persistent cribbers, I've seen a variety of creative things to stop them.  For example, we had a nervous and thin skinned older TB gelding who had worn his teeth down to almost nothing from chewing on wood.  He wore a crib collar when turned out, and a metal muzzle in the stall to give his throat a break from the cribbing strap.  The muzzle just made it so he couldn't get his teeth on anything.    At a different barn, we had a lesson horse who would chew on the metal stall door and had also worn his teeth down to almost nothing.  We cut open a plastic pipe (it was flexible) and fit it over the top rung of his door - it was too wide to get his mouth on, and didn't do as much damage as metal.    Yet another horse had his stall specially fitted up to eliminate places to crib on - his water bucket hung from a bungee cord so that if he tried to crib on it, it would move and he couldn't get a good grip.  He also was fed out of a rubber ground feeder - again, so he couldn't get a hold on it.  His windows were blocked off by tying a metal grate over it - so he couldn't get his mouth on the window ledge.  Things like that.|`|AA11570905	Do you mean chewing on the wood?  Or do you mean he is grabbing the wood with his upper teeth and sucking in air?  If he is chewing the wood you can buy some bad tasting stuff to paint on the wood.  If he is sucking in air then you need to provide him with more turn out.  Horses who are never or rarely confined to a stall almost never develop stable vices like cribbing, weaving etc.|`|AA11606210	Cribbing is a habit learned many times out of boredom and frustration. Horses are roaming, grazing herd animals by nature, so turn him out in the field with other horses. He could also be stressed. Don't stall your horse, unless weather absolutely dictates the need. And when you do, give him plenty of hay, preferably coastal, to keep his mouth busy. My Arab gelding is a cribber if he is confined or stressed, as when his pasture mate died. He now has coastal at his beck and call, and he stays outside in all weather, and has never been happier in his life. He has a blanket for the cold, and that's fine with him. If he isn't stalled, there is another reason for his habit. Are the other horses he's turned out with accepting him as part of the herd? If not, he is cribbing in frustration at his loneliness. I hope this helps and you can get him to stop.|`|vaulPrAmaa	Cheaper compared to cribbing collars or other is McNasty.  It's an all-natural spray on for the wood and it tastes HORRIBLE!!

We also removed her feeding tub and replaced it with a bucket we could take in and out of the stall.  We used 1 1/2" steel galvanized edging to protect wood edges in the stall.  Be sure your horse gets plenty of exercise and pasture time.

Also cutting holes in a milk jug, putting some treats or pellets inside and tying it up so he can play with it and knock food out is great.|`|dJ4i0uReaa	Sounds like your horse might be bored. Attach a ball to the roof of his stall and buy him a salt block.|`|AtEIkzWYaa	Try to work on the underlying problem if possible. He needs to be a horse, so anything you can do to get him out and grazing or eating his hay outside would help. Horses develop these vices because they were never intended to stay in a box and eat two meals a day.  Any chance you can give him extra hay during the day?
tPGxPDvBaa	No they don't need to be stripped for normal life only show ones had to be done.  The vast majority of owners don't hand strip their dogs.  It is too expensive & time consuming for little difference. It doesn't matter if their coat is slightly softer if they aren't being shown. She can keep her dog however she likes.  I have a number of clients with scz. who aren't clipped like scz. or a short trim allover.  But for the fist few clips need to be done by a pro only.  Otherwise the pup could turn out to hate grooming  w/o proper handling.  Do NOT use the big box for grooming - use only grooming shops.|`|AA10229248	Stripping is not mandatory in a pet quality dog. I worked in a grooming shop for years and we only had one client insist on having their dog hand stripped. There's really just no point to it if you're not showing. Using the clippers is fine. The coat will be softer than a hand stripped dog. But that's about it.    You can pick up clippers at any pet store. You'll also want a book on grooming schnauzers so you can learn where the lines are. You'll also need a decent pair of scissors to shape the eyebrows, beard, skirt, etc. All in all, it's usually easier to pay $30 and have a professional do the grooming for you.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Dont get a mini if you are not going to take him to a PRO.  these dogs hair,is so bad if not by a pro,you have to take them   to a PRO every 6-8 weeks,if not,dont get one.  and put your yorkie on a PRO im sure if you ask your vet,the vet will   do it also.|`|vPde97E2aa	Anybody who'd BUZZ a YT isn't capble of PROPERLY maintaining a a hand-stripped coat.

A PROPER schnauzer  LOOKS like a schnauzer!-DUH?|`|ShXDO3Tkaa	I personally prefer a stripped coat and was fortunate enough to have someone who taught me how to do it properly. It takes a big commitment to maintain a stripped coat so most pet people have their Miniature Schnauzer's coat clipped. It does ruin the harsh coat to clipper it, but if you are not going to be showing the dog does it really matter? It certainly doesn't matter to the dog, so unless you are willing to put in the time to learn how to strip and maintain it go ahead and clipper him.    Grooming your Schnauzer yourself is entirely doable. If you are are able to groom your Yorkie you should be able to groom a Miniature Schnauzer. There are several good sources on line for learning how to do it correctly. It does take practice to get good at it, but it's only hair and it does grow back.    If you do decide to groom your dog yourself take a look at this websites: http://britmorschnauzers.com/groom.html    This website offers a excellent video on grooming for sale: http://www.legacyms.com/

You just drop a small one in, and it might help to tie it up in some stockings, so it doesn't make your tank messy.  The shrimp will rot and create the ammonia in your tank.  Then you just have to wait for the ammonia to turn into nitrites, then nitrates...and your done.  As long as you use a small shrimp there should be no smell.  It worked fine for me.    I would get a betta rather than the adf's.  I had both and the frogs were terribly boring, although cute.

B6zl0AJDaa	It depends upon the size of the horse.  Basic rule of thumb a horse can carry up to 20% of their own weight, so you're looking at a horse weighing upwards of 1,250 LBS.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Weight carrying capacity is based largely on the horse's build.  The width and shortness of the loin area (spine area in front of the croup) is  an important factor.  A long and narrow loin in a heavy built horse will not carry weight as well as a lighter framed horse with short, wide loins.  Arabs are known for their capacity to carry as much as 30% or more of their own weight, despite being finer boned.  They are 2 vertebrae shorter through the back than other breeds.  Some drafts are sickle hocked and long loined and can't handle as much weight on their backs as a well built Arab. Bone mass (density) is also important.  Some horses with large bone circumference have less dense bone and are not as strong as horses with denser, but smaller circumference of bone.  So, a 900 pound well conformed Arab, carrying 30% of his own weight, could handle 270 pounds of weight on his back.  A horse with a longer, narrower loin may only be able to carry 20% of his own weight, so to carry 270 pounds, would have to weigh 1350 pounds.  A stocky built quarter horse with a long weak loin is not equal to one with a short wide loin......so the build of each horse has to be assessed, as well as the weight of the horse.  Also, less height of the horse with a lower center of gravity is better in balancing the weight of a heavier rider, so a taller horse is not necessarily better when it comes to carrying more weight.  Beyond just the loins and bone density, good angles to the joints in the legs are important since they determine the way concussive forces are distributed, and bad angles cause bone, tendon, ligament and joint stresses.  Also, the longer bones of a tall horse render the tendons and ligaments more vulnerable to stress injuries.  Just bear all of this in mind when you are looking for the right horse.....there are many horses of varying breeds that will accommodate your weight just fine.  Think of John Wayne jumping the fence on his Saddlebred in True Grit, or Wayne Newton who weighs 300 pounds and breeds and rides Arabs.|`|px27V5N9aa	Figure a horse can carry 25% of their body weight.  For strenuous/long trails I like to make that 20%    1200 lb horse can carry on long trails: 240lbs  1200 lb horse can carry for short rides: 300 lbs    liniment rubs before and after are good for the horse carrying a heavy rider. :)|`|vow5ULxTaa	a horse only can carry 1/4 of its weight so a 800 pound horse should only carry 200 pounds.  etc.  You really shouldn't push the weight limit though becasue the horse may then get joint problems and back problems.|`|4KY26xQqaa	Not meaning to offened or anything but I would have to say a heavier breed, such as a cob, clydesdale and ardenees.  For your height mmm... I would go around 16hh area but I'm sure a chunky 15hh could carry you just aslong as you weren't doing top competition e.t.c.

My gelding is a 16hh QH gelding that weighs about 1300 pounds and has very correct conformation.  The conformation of the horse is as important as the size.  A larger horse with a long weak back won't be able to handle as much weight as a smaller one with a strong back and good legs.  A horse with a strong short back and good conformation will be able to handle around 30% of his total weight, whereas the same height horse with a weak back will be sore with 20%.      It really all depends on what you want to do.  Most horses with weaker backs will de fine for short pleasure rides than they will if you are wanting to be a barrel racer or reining competitor.  If you want something to compete with make sure he has great conformation (you should anyway IMO) and make sure your workouts are reasonable for that horse.      I've ridden horses from 15hh to 16.3hh with strong and weak backs.  I just made sure to keep an eye on what the horse's body was telling me.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	I would say find a horse that is around 16hh and weighs at least 1200-1500 lbs. That way you can ride and feel safe and know the horse isnt getting hurt. Also make sure you look at the horses conformaion. Look for a horse with a stong back and strong legs...such as this...    http://www.freewebs.com/yardhand/Emma%20...|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You would want a larger horse with a relatively short back. I think the theory is that the horse can carry 20% of their weight, but a horse with a long back will have a harder time than a horse with a short back. TB vs. Andalusian. A draft cross or warmblood could carry you like nothing. :)    Congratulations on your weight loss!
WqGxGJkbaa	Yes I am afraid that a completely dry food diet is bad for your cat and I speak from experience - I have one cat with struvite crystals and another with diabetes (both having been adopted late in life and having had a predominently dry diet).  Cats in the wild are not programmed to drink very much as they obtain most of the moisture they need from their prey.  Domestic cats are no different and are notorious for not drinking enough.  The combination of this and the grains/fillers and carbohydrates in dry food  can be potentially life threatening.  Dry food was invented for humans and not for cats.  It doesnt smell as much as wet food, it is easier to leave out all day with no messy bowls and, because of the fillers (drop some dry food in water and see what happens), the cat eats less making the customer think it is good value for money.    Of course, not every cat fed a dry diet will die because of it, but you have to look at the facts (and the fact is that dry food is NOT beneficial for their teeth - they hardly even chew it anyway).      Unfortunately, I do have one cat who refuses to eat anything other than dry food so I am trying to switch her to Orijen which is completely grainless and is high protein/lo carb.  If your cat does like wet food then research good makes on the internet (I use Bozita which is Swedish and is mostly meat, again with no grains/fillers).      A water fountain is a very good idea - all my 6 cats love theirs and it does entice them to drink more as it stays fresh and they seem to like the movement of the water.      I will get loads of thumbs down for this - I always do - as my opinion is that feeding a completely dry diet is simply lazy - a cat is a carnivore and needs MEAT not dry rubbish.  There will be people saying "my cat is very healthy" and I sincerely hope that this continues but diabetes usually comes on later in life so there is every possibility that one day it might happen to their cat.      You have done your research well - trust what it is telling you.    Edit - Law L - No-one has said that the cat's stomach EXPANDS.  It is the food which expands, making the cat feel full and hence it eats less and hence its cheap miserable owner thinks it is good value.|`|AA11611859	No, dry food is not bad if....    ...you don't mind urinary, kidney, liver, or pancreas disease  ...you don't mind dealing with a diabetic cat  ...you don't mind digestive issues from allergies  ...you don't mind digestive issues from the bacteria  ...you don't want your cat to live past 12-15 years of age    A good dry food is okay for a small portion of your cat's diet.  The vast majority, however, should be wet.    Vets are given very little training in nutrition (a few weeks given by the pet food companies), and the same goes with vet techs.  Shelters feed dry because it is more convenient than having to open and dispose of many cans of food.  People who breed and show cats NEVER feed dry.|`|Nkqk9t0faa	My cat normally eats dry food has no problem with it. but I do spoil them time to time by tuna , sardines, and those expensive cat food. I love my squishy cat! for kitten they a slightly more wet food till there teeth develop etc. As far as what to feed them try out what ever you believe they like more you might have to give them selection from time to time to figure out which food they like.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO a diet of both dry and canned is better then all dry.  We feed one meal of dry, one meal of canned and our cats are healthy and happy.    Thinking back with our rex (15 1/2 yrs old when he died), he was on dry his entire life.  But a year or two before that he got really skinny and I suspect it was diabetes.  At the time I didn't take him in to be checked as he picked up the weight again.  So I can't say for sure if being on dry his entire life did trigger it or not.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Edited for chalice the vet nurse    What makes me so knowledgeable about nutrtion. I don't make things up to try and look goof for example  you wrote  It is not the lack of water content that makes some dry foods a potential problem, it's the actual ingredients of them. They tend to be high in phosphorus which makes them bad for kidneys. They're also far more dense in calories than wet food so it's easy to overfeed with them = fat cat = more likely to develop diabetes    This is just not true and the proof is here. Please feel free to compare as fed phosperous levels and calories between wet and dry and see  http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/CanFo...  http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/dryfo...         law has asked many food questions and just refuses to feed canned no mater what. By what he wrote above, I guess he thinks humans and cats are the same. The thing is, humans dogs are omnivores cats are obligate  carnivores   Oh and as far as his 9 year old cat goes, I am sure it is true.   I am also sure that a person can live to be 100+ and healthy eating  just kentucky fried chicken and smoking 2 packs a day. It is when you take the example of thousands of animals that you see what a difference a healthy diet makes over feeding garbage    I agree with most of what is written above I don't know but may have even written some of it under this or a different name.Some of what you wrote was in my old profile  I had a cat get diabetes from eating dry food and have adopted a diabetic cat that was on dry food who is now in remission on an all wet diet. Dry is not allowed near my house. As far as water goes, cats are not big drinkers and cannot possibly drink enough to make up for the dehydrating factors of dry foods. Cats in the wild get their water needs from their food/prey This factor alone to me makes even top quality dry foods bad for cats.   I do not know about food expanding in their stomachs but I know adding water to dry food is a recipe for bacteria   grain free canned foods or a specially prepared raw diet are best for all cats of all ages and activity levels. I am sue you have seen this but this is my normal post       Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.  http://www.catinfo.org/                                  http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|w1lh1INHaa	People  who have had a lot of cats for a long time and done more research on cat food than any vet ever gets in training will all tell you the same thing:  A diet of primarily dry food is simply not good.  Blue Buff is an excellent dry food, but still, should not constitute the bulk of a cat's diet.      Dry food was developed for convenience -- it keeps stool small and dry, is easy to handle, and no cans.  But, even a good brand like Blue Buff doesn't provide the protein or moisture cats need.  Enticing a cat to drink more does not resolve the issue, but can make it worse.    To maintain a healthy cat, even a mid-grade wet is superior.  Every issue I have ever had with a cat (primarily uti/bladder problems in my case) can be traced to a diet of dry food.  As they get older, they are also unable to tolerate many of the grains and glutens that dry food requires to, well, make it dry.    Here are a few links for your edification:  http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html  http://www.bornfreeusa.org/facts.php?p=3...  http://www.littlebigcat.com/?action=libr...|`|vJRMmgd6aa	Well this is news to me, everyone always told me its bad to feed them wet food!!! Ive had both my cats for 3 years and they only eat dry food and their fine, but now I realize I should be giving them both!|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Yes, dry food is really bad! Solid Gold and Blue Buffalo are good quality foods to feed your kitties, but stick with the wet! Contrary to popular belief, wet food is indeed healthiest for cats.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.      Edit: As Chalice has so kindly demonstrated, vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their veterinary schooling. Some vets do further their education after their schooling (like the vet from the catinfo website I linked to), but most vets know very little about pet nutrition.    Edit x2: Chalice, you mean to tell me that vets don't get kickbacks from Science Diet and Royal Canin? /Really?/:    http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/student...    http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/student...      Darksong~|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    What you have posted in your question about dry food is absolutely true. Dry food was invented for the convenience of humans to make feeding their cats easier. Dry food, in fact is nutritionally poor.    For an excellent read about dry food, visit  http://www.catinfo.org/    It has all the information about dry food and why it is not sound nutrition for felines. Since dry food has become so popular due to its convenience, there has been a rise in diabtetes, obesity,food allergies, inflamoatory bowel disease and kidney and liver problems. Additionally  it is a myth that dry food helps to keep cats' teeth clean. In fact pieces of dry food can lodge between their teeth and become a source of cavities and gum disease.      If you are looking for the best food possible do not feed dry. Feed the best quality ( not necessarily the most expensive-either) moist food that has meat as the first ingredient, has no grain, by products and other fillers.    Nutro, Evo, Wellness are three of the top quality cat foods on the market. Wellness is available at PetCo.    Read labels on cans carefully. Here is a guide to follow.  http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/canfo...    Hope this helps and good luck with your kitty.   Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Feed only Moist high quality cat food.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	That's funny, my nine year old cat who has only EVER eaten dry food has no health problems and has never had an 'expanding stomach' due to the mix of dry food and water. That's like saying to you 'OMG DON'T EAT CEREAL- when you drink water, it expands in your stomach!' Whoever said that last thing is a moron.|`|ZGkGLW4gaa	Absolutely not true whatsoever. I have worked at a veterinary clinic for over 5 years and never heard of such nonsense. Of course dry food is better for their teeth, breath and stool. Veterinarians recommend a high quality food that meets the needs of the animal and to find that out its as simple as calling your local vet. There are many different diets and feeding the wrong diet can make a pet ill (wet or dry food).     Also, I have fed my cat dry food from the vet for 12 years and she has no medical issues at all!    Good luck and I hope this helped!|`|Net8og9Baa	No, dry food is not BAD if fed properly.  While it is true that there are carbohydrates in dry food (it's what holds the kibbles together), it's not harmful to the pet, or they wouldn't make it that way!    There are pros and cons to both dry and canned foods.  True, the canned foods have more water in them, but have less nutrition per ounce because of that water, thus you have to feed more.  You also pay a lot more for canned food, mostly because of the cans themselves.  Dry food has all of the nutrition an adult cat needs, but lacks the moisture.  It is true that dry food does not help the teeth -- stab a dry kitty kibble with a pencil, what does it do?  It will crush, and has no "scraping" action on the tooth (pencil).      HOWEVER, there are "Oral Care" diets out there for both cats and dogs, but they are generally higher in fat.  If you're looking into purchasing one of these products, take it home and do the "tooth test" with the pencil!    If you want to feed a dry food, go ahead and feed a dry food.  Always offer plenty of fresh water, and if you're concerned that your kitty isn't drinking enough, you can add a little water to the kibble.|`|AA10356572	okay here is a true storey..  i worked in a shelter and a man brought in a lovely registered siamese cat of his - he told us she was 2 years old and he couldnt keep her - when the vet tech examined the cat she figured he was lying the cat was at least 8 or 9 years - its teeth being so rotten..  turns out he had papers to prove her age was 2 but all she ever ate was canned food    cats need BOTH..  dry food all day long and canned 1 or 2 x a day.. with water added to make a nice soup which will increase their water intake  I personally DO NOT like cat water fountians - they build up with mold inside the hosing..  use Stainless steel water bowl and change the water 2-3 x a day|`|AA10859773	Ok, no need to panic.    But it's true - the nature of dry food means that it's really not healthy for cats, even if the food is grainless, top quality, and nutritionally complete and balanced.    It's not just the fact that it's dry, although that's a big part of it.  It's also about what goes into it.  I won't go into detail, but if you'd like to learn more about how it's made, check out the first link I'm providing.    Many also believe that dry food cleans the teeth, but that is a myth.  There may be some evidence to indicate that eating dry food may *help* to prevent dental problems, but I and many others believe that any specious assistance it provides are far outweighed by the negatives.  So long as you provide proper dental care it's nothing you need to worry about.    I use dry food as a treat because I only feed wet food.  But I understand that other people have good reasons for needing to feed some dry food, or perhaps they're just hedging their bets, hoping to reap whatever dental benefits it may provide.    Although I think cats are better off without any dry food, I don't think it's the end of the world if you do provide some.  My suggestion for those situations is to feed at least some wet food too, preferably half the daily intake.    And if you do feed any dry, go with the best you can afford.  I don't recall offhand how Solid Gold is, but I do know that BB has a nearly grainless dry food called Wilderness(?) which is fairly decent.  I think that would be ok.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	It's okay to feed dry food, but I do recommend also feeding wet food.  Ideally your cat should be on an all wet food diet but a species appropriate grain free, low carb dry food is better than the junk food found at grocery stores.  If you're going to go with a dry food, I recommend that you consider Wellness Core or Innova EVO.  Both are excellent brands that are formulated to closely match a cat's natural diet.  If you're feeding Blue Buffalo, I recommend their Wilderness line since it's grain free.  The article linked below is written by a DVM and goes into great detail about cat nutrition.  All of your questions about dry vs. wet food should be answered there.  It's a long article, but I'm sure you'll find it to be very informative.  Thank you for taking the time to consider what's best for your cats!  http://catinfo.org    ETA - Dry food does NOT clean their teeth any more than chips clean your teeth.  Just as with your teeth, regular brushing is the only thing that will ensure long term good dental health for cats.  My cats don't eat dry food and they all have excellent teeth.  Dental issues arise in cats regardless of what they eat if their teeth are not cleaned regularly.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Yeah I've seen people say that - that quote wasn't from Ken was it? Sure he'll be posting on this q any time soon.    It is not the lack of water content that makes some dry foods a potential problem, it's the actual ingredients of them. They tend to be high in phosphates which makes them bad for kidneys. They're also far more dense in calories than wet food so it's easy to overfeed with them = fat cat = more likely to develop diabetes.    Proper nutrition companies are well aware of these risks which is why premium quality dry food is NOT like this. So long as your cat is maintaining a decent waist line on a dry food diet, he's no more likely to get diabetes than any other cat.    As for dry food not being good for teeth - anyone who's worked with animals for a few years know that isn't true. Again, low quality dry foods e.g. Whiskas, Meow Mix tend not to be much help for teeth, but are still less damaging than wet foods as they're less cloying. You can get dry foods specifically designed for dental care and these are excellent for teeth, especially the prescription ones. These kibbles are large and honeycomb structured so the tooth has to be inserted several times before it breaks and it gets 'brushed' each time.    I don't know about the brands you've mentioned because they're not available in England, where I am. However I hear they are premium quality brands.    End of the day, a normal healthy cat is not going to walk around thirsty. If they eat dry food, they will drink when necessary.     Personally I like to feed cats dry and wet food, although an all dry diet is perfectly acceptable and, I think, preferable to an all-wet diet. I currently feed my cat dental biscuits and wet food but am thinking of changing him to cooked meat instead of canned food, purely for his teeth.    Can I also just say, the quote in your question is full of irrelevant points, especially the 'take it from someone whose cat got diabetes from eating dry food' - who drew that conclusion? Most probably the cat was overweight and eating some rubbish quality dry food from a supermarket. ONE example is meaningless!    Chalice    EDIT: Unlike Ken, I actually work in veterinary and can tell you that vets do not get incentives to sell company's foods. Of course we get pizza when the reps visit us, that's what reps DO for any product in any industry!! I would just love to know what makes Ken so well qualified in nutrition.    EDIT: Yes Darksong, I really mean to tell you we don't get 'kickbacks' from Hills and Royal Canin. Obviously we mark up the food we sell, as we do with all products inc drugs, but the profits made from food are so miniscule they're barely worth it, financially.    BTW I'm NOT a vet, so I have not had any of the training you think vets do or don't get at university.
UPTu7uIVaa	Growing up we always had our cats declawed.  We also had trouble with them using the litterbox, so it may not matter what litter you use, your cat may not use it consistently.  My 3 are not declawed, and I won't do it to a cat ever again.  The scabs my mom's cat had on her paws were terrible.  The vet should tell you to use shredded newspaper until his paws have healed.  My kitten is actually getting neutered today.  That is not as big of a deal.  My other male didn't seem to have any problems w/ his neutering.  Aside from the inhumane part, you really should reconsider getting him declawed for the sheer reason that it does seem that cats don't consistently use the litterbox once you've declawed them.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Ok since you refuse to listen to the horrors of declawing and mutilating your cat, here are some of the things to "expect":    1.  Your cat will be in pain and won't understand why his feet hurt or that he is not walking normal anymore - so your cat may have some psychological problems.    2.  Your cat may decide the litter is hurting his feet - so he will go pee on clothes, carpet, rugs (softer stuff).    3.  Your cat may start biting a lot more or hiding in fear as he has no self defense now.    4.  He will not be able to climb and jump properly.    5.  His claws could grow back deformed and more painful then the declawing is.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Don't be surprised if you can't get your cat to use the litterbox, perhaps ever again.  I'm sure you're prepared for that, since you've got your mind made up.  If you think of how inconvenient training him to use a scratching post and trimming his claws is, think of how inconvenient it's going to be if he pees all over the house instead of in his box?|`|60mDEusiaa	Well, the litter shouldn't be a problem.However, you can't let your cat outside, because it can't climb a tree or defend itself.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	Your vet will tell you what to watch for when you go to pick him up.  As for litter, I was told, when I neutered my cat, to use paper litter for a few weeks then switch back to regular litter.  Good luck.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Just try different litters until you find one that works. I'm all for those natural litters....but then I'd trim a cats claws weekly before I had it de-clawed but to each his own. I would suggest having plenty of treats ready for the cats return home as well. Everyone I know that has has their cats de-clawed and 'fixed' at once said that it only take a couple days for the cat to want to play again and a few days after that for them to be 100%. In the meantime just pamper the kitty. Good luck!|`|AA12398420	What you can EXPECT is the cat to become a biter because it no longer can protect itself with its claws. And you can EXPECT a personality change...it will be traumatized and will hide more often. And you can EXPECT it never to use the litterbox because it does not like the feel of the litter.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	Hey, what do you care it's uncomfortable? Removing its toes isn't exactly going to be amazingly comfortable, yet you're prepared to do that.|`|5bHHlH73aa	declwaing is normal....you juyst want the cat to stop scrathing stuff.......BUT TAKING OFF HIS THING?!?!?!?!? wow........but you should expect to become very unhappy|`|ZGkGLW4gaa	Through my experience at a veterinary clinic, I have learned that for freshly de-clawed cats they seem to be okay with Yesterdays News litter (recycled from newspapers). They are large pellet type pieces that don't contain dust or small pieces that could make the litter box a bad place.    Keep your cat as quiet and relaxed as possible when you bring him home after the surgery. Your vet will explain the procedure and the after care.    How I see it is that a de clawed cat who has a wonderful home is better than a cat who has no home!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Just normal post-operation things - if you see any signs of infection, call your vet.    I have had two declawed cats (my parents decided to have that done when I was a child) and both use normal clay litter without any objections.  If the cat is sore at first, you can try just laying some newspaper down in a box for her to pee on for now.|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	When I brought my male cat home from a de-clawing, many years ago, he screamed in pain when he tried to jump off the couch. He had to drag himself to the litter box. He was never the same again.    I wanted to apologize to him for hurting him, just to save some damned furniture, but I couldn't of course. Too late.      And I will never do that to a cat again.     Just food for thought.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	My friends cat was de-clawed and she was perfectly fine! she went back to regular litter right from the start but if yours seems a little tender, try the news-paper kind. Losing some claws (yes, I've lost nails and toes so don't yell that at me!) is better then some cat having to be put to sleep because no one wants torn up furniture! Not all cats will just scratch on Posts, no matter how many or kind you have! Just treat you cat tenderly and watch for infection. Your vet will tell you all you need to know. Don't be a fraid to call after wards to the vet if any other questions come up!  Good luck!|`|5412173baed2a21884761c1f6bde287baa	I don't know much about declawing, but after we fixed my cat she had some trouble climbing into her litter box. If you have one with high sides, you might want to consider just putting litter in a garbage bag and putting it near wherever he/she sleeps. That way the cat doesn't have to climb over the side after surgery. I've also heard of people putting a heating pad underneath the blankets or beds during recovery to make kitty more comfortable.    If it makes you feel any better, I have a friend who has two declawed cats and they are pretty much the same animals they were beforehand. I chose not to declaw, but it's a personal choice for everyone. Good luck!|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	Having 2 cats who have gone through all this : You can't use regular kitty litter because can get into the incisions and cause infection. Use shredded newspaper and clean the box a few times a day. Most cats handle the whole procedure well.
AA12128656	if you're choosing between the two, i'd go with the rotty. they're highly trainable and generally are pretty mellow, once they're trained when it's time to play and when it's not.    in terms of destruction, a husky is a FAR busier dog than a rotty, and any dog can be destructive when bored to death. you have dog toys, right?    i'm sorry about your shepherd.    rotties don't have as much of a temper as people think they do, they just need a master who is a good pack leader, and then, with good training, are as gentle as lambs.|`|AA10029366	Both of these breeds may likely see your little terrier as prey. Rottweilers aren't aggressive unless they're poorly bred -- seeing that you're getting a shelter dog and don't know anything about it's history, you may run into that possibility.    Siberians can be HIGHLY destructive if they are bored or under-exercised, and MUST have a fenced-in yard. The Rottie will stick around; the Siberian won't.    Frankly, I'm not sure either of these dogs is a very good choice for your situation. Please do plenty of research on both breeds before you make a decision. They are very different breeds -- both from each other and from a JRT. You need to know what you're getting into.    Siberian info:  http://www.shca.org  http://www.kaylenbergsiberians.com/ready...    Rottie info:  http://www.amrottclub.org/breedinfo.htm    ADD: "Gorgeous" is NOT a reason to get a Siberian husky. In fact, it's probably the reason the dog is in the shelter in the first place! People get these dogs because they're "gorgeous", and have no idea what they're getting into with the breed.|`|6AqFenaSaa	Leave it up to your dog. Talk to the shelter (people do this all the time) about arranging a meeting with each of the dog to see how they interact. If your motivation is a companion for your Jack Russell, this is a must. Then take it from there.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Husky's like to roam around. My aunts ran away numerous times. He jumped over the fence, and then they dug under it.  I dont have a problem with either dogs! We actually thought about adopting a rotti from the humane society as well. If you have room for a Husky then great! He is going to need more room to roam and run than a terrier!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	It really also depend on how old these two shelter dogs are, how much time you are going to spend with them, if you are willing to take them to training (especially if they are still young). Why don't you rather wait and see if you can get another German Shepherd.|`|qEOJzbJraa	Agreed with Loki.    Rottweilers aren't aggressive unless they're poorly bred and poorly raised. Since your getting one from the shelter, you don't know anything about the dogs history or background information and it's basically it's a "you get what you get" type situation.     Sibes can be extremely destructive and can result in aggression if not properly trained and excercised enough. They do need a fenced in yard and are not suitable for an apartment life or someone who has very little time on there hands (i.e. someone who doesn't have the time to train or excercise a dog). One thing about Sibes is that they can't be left alone in a unsecured fence or no fence at all. Unlike the Rottie, they'll dip out the yard.    But if it came down to which one is better, I would personally go for the Rottie. But that's just because they fit my lifestyle.  I wuld reccomend you read more information about both breeds before jumping into the boat.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	A Husky!!! They're so gorgeous.  Besides, it sounds like that's what you want anyways. You gave plenty of reasons not to get a rottweiler, but no reason why you shouldn't get a husky.|`|t6xWtEPtaa	After 6 years of having a Rottie, I would recommend that you adopt the Rottweiler.  They're very intelligent dogs. Also very loving.  Any breed of dog might tear up a house or be aggresive if not properly trained.  I've actually heard more of that about Huskies.  With either dog, make sure you're prepared for a stubborn dog!  My mother has a Rat Terrier, which is somewhat similar to a Jack Russell.  She and my Rottweiler got along very well during the year I moved back in with my mother.  Sorry to hear about your German Shepard, but good luck with your new Fur Child!|`|b5ecvoTnaa	Well, it really depends.  how old is the rotti? If she's older 1-2 years, she may be a little difficult to train, if she's under a year old, she could be trained to get along fine with your Jack Russell. She'll probably be territorial with other dogs, but I know a rottweiler, and she's a total mush and a sweetheart. She has actually given a couple dogs stitches, but that was for two reasons. 1) the dogs bit her over and over again 2) on another occasion, a pit bull came loose off its chain and attacked his owner.     As for Siberian Huskies, they require a lot of exercise, and they shed literally gobs of hair for months. Don't keep them in the kitchen. Who wants that in their food. Hope you pick the right dog for your family.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Huskies need a great deal of off leash exercise, not so much with rottis. Jacks are high energy dogs so i would think the Huskie would be a good match. Dogs are individulas so you can't go on the breed description of temperment only. HUkies shed heavily in spring, are you prepared for that? A grown Rotti may not ahve been trained properly & may be hard to handle. Only you know the 2 dogs in question, but I would think the HUskie's need for exercise would compliment the Jack more than the Rotti. You can also take your Jack to meet each dog & see how they feel about each other.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Try to keep in mind that dogs are dogs; not humans.  They do not have human emotions and they do not pine away for things from the past.  There is no guarantee that bringing another dog into your home will bring joy to you and your other dog.  Most of the time the opposite happens because the human in the household isn't a good pack leader & the dogs have to take on that role.  Deciding who is the pack leader can result in fights & behavior that you didn't expect.  Are you the pack leader now?  Can you calmly & assertively control two dogs?  Do you have the time and energy to take care of a large breed dog who has different needs than a small breed?  A siberian husky needs to have a job & get a ton of exercise or it will develop behavioral issues.  A Rottweiler also needs to be kept well disciplined with obedience skills & have a ton of exercise.  Are you available to give that to a new dog?  Think before you act.  Good luck.|`|bUNrQVQyaa	I do have a Siberian Husky, hes a year old, let me tell  you huskies CAN be agressive too. And if your getting it from a shelter, your chances are higher of it. Yeah huskies are gorgeous but they are a handful. Don't just read online, ask husky owners and see what they really are like.  good luck|`|rMrcsjxpaa	Jack Russell Terriers are very territorial, from what I've heard, but yours sounds kind. The Siberian Husky and Rottweiler have different traits, and you had better do some research on both before you decide completely. For example, which one sheds more fur? Which one needs more food? Which one is nicer? Depending on your budget, get one or the other. Maybe if you like them equally, you could get them both! Have a pleasant day!|`|AA10529198	There may be problems with adopting either of those two dogs, since aggression and dominance are bred into both breeds.  If you were adopting a puppy, you could keep them together and there may not be as many dominance issues.    If possible, you should pick which one you prefer, and give them a trial (say in a dog run) - and see whether they get along.  If they do, then maybe it will work out.  If there is aggression, especially with the Rotti !!! you may not be able to teach an old dog new tricks !!!|`|WLNX00c3aa	each dog has it's own temperment.  and experience is best at any situation.    bring your jack russel to the shelter when you meet the rotti and the husky. see if they hit it off.  if they dont, then you'll know that neither one is right to fit in your family.|`|q7TxQOqKaa	Take it from Loki and I we both own husky's, I DO NOT recommend that you take on a husky If you don't know what your getting into on the other had rotties are the same deal, Loki covered that very well, Working with rescue I see alot of people who get sibes cause they are beautiful, and then realize that they also have ALOT of bad quality's when not properly handled and don t have a proper outlet for there never ending energy, Also sibes WILL destroy your house as well when left alone with nothing to do, weather you decide on the rotti or the sibe please do a lot of research and also plan for extra activeties  and take a beginner traning class with your new addition you will find it will help a great deal
NBDaeo8xaa	I have a bichon frise/shih tzu-he will be 2  and is just the most loveable--he loves to walk! I live near Red Bank/Long Branch area--too far away to meet to walk--but maby we can share some ideas? thanks sue [MAX]|`|bFzu835Aaa	Check meetup.com and see. If not, start your own.
ArBOK95aaa	yes, you should get them done on the same day, that way they are both a little tired and sore at the same time and won't pounce on the other to play before they are ready.    They can stay in the same room, they can have run of the house.  They recommend trying to keep them quite, but done that young, they recover very quickly... and trying to keep a kitten quiet is like trying to hold back the tide :)    yes, the litter you were using is fine.      the boy will have a tiny little shaved area on his scrotum, they will make a small incision, and remove the testicles.  They will glue the incision together, and he will recover much more quickly than the girl.    She will have a small incision on her belly.  They use a hooked instrument to pull out the uterus and the ovaries.  There will be some internal sutures - but those will dissolve over time, and then they should glue the outer incision together so she should not need to go back to have sutures removed.    sedation can make them groggy for up to 36 hours after surgery, and can make their tummies upset, so feeding small meals until you know they are going to keep things down is a good idea.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Good for you for doing this!  They will be much happier and safer for it!  It is fine to get them done the same day.  They should be able to stay in the same room.  If you are worried about too much exercise, you can try to separate them for just a couple of days and that should be fine.  Be sure to ask your vet to show you the surgical sites and be sure you know what to look for if there is a problem.  Young cats like this very seldom have any type of problem, though.  I do not see any problem with the litter.  If it would make you feel better you can go to regular clay litter for 7-10 days.  Just be aware that some cats can be very finicky about their litter if it is changed.  Do not give them anything for pain (aspirin is a deadly poison to them) or other symptoms, without checking with your vet first.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I'd get them done together.  Can you keep one in the empty room and one in the bathroom or your bedroom for a few days?    The litter is fine - just check them after they go the first few days to be sure nothing is sticking to the incisions and that nothing is irritated or pus showing.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	It's pretty much going to be another day for the male cat, female spaying is a little more intrusive.  Other than minor discomfort and an attitude, his neutering should go fine.  I used a tiny bit of antibacterial ointment on the site to help things along, but your male probably won't even have stitches.  The female will.  Think of having a hysterectomy, being stitched up and sent home.  So I would absolutely give her privacy, her own litter box for a while, and I imagine in a week they will have you come in to remove the stitches (or staples).  She'll probably still be sensitive after that, but she should not be around other cats while she has stitches.  They will be fine, and good for you for spaying and neutering!!!!!!!!!!!  On an added note, it might be a good idea to have two litterboxes.  Cats like to have their own spot to "go".|`|mR5RkClpaa	get them both done at once ,one room is enough , they will be sleeping all the time at first anyway yes let them use same litter just keep moving dirty soil as soon as either one has used it , and clean it out completely every day
nBKs8fk4aa	Hi, I don't really see the need for you to help out.  He'll ease his way out of his skin in no time.  Snakes typical shed all in one piece as you mentioned but sometimes the shed can either get snagged on a something in the tank and rip.      However if you do see that some time has passed (2days) and he still has not shed the remainder of the skin just place him in a warm bath for a few minutes, let him swim around, and then place him back in the enclosure.  This will help loosen the skin a bit.  If that fails soak him again the following day, however this time place him in a towel and let him move along your hands (hold him like you would  a microphone, let him move through your hand while with a slight firm grip) this will peel his shed off in a sort of natural fashion.  Hope I helped|`|EJOqYvMZaa	give it a bath for about 15 Min's this will soften the skin up you can then ease the skin off gentle . next time you notice the snake going into shed bump the humidity up spaying or you can place a wet box in the enclosure this should help|`|3IUMh4Igaa	You can soak her in some warm water for about 15 minutes. Then take a damp face cloth and let him crawl around in that for a few minutes.
nHP9Jq1Baa	I am assuming you mean horse shoes as in iron shoes that a farrier nails onto the hoof.  Anyway. There aren't exactly horse socks, but there are things a bit like riding chaps, bits of cloth that you wrap around the horse's legs and attach with Velcro. These are mostly for show-jumping and cross country courses, to protect the legs of the horse.|`|FegAXbgiaa	there are hoof socks : D    http://www.horsetackco.com/hock-knee-pro...

bFzu835Aaa	Most of the time, a "pedi perch" (rough perch that will wear down the nails as the bird sits, walks, etc on it) will be enough to take care of your birds nails. If not you can use regular nail clippers to carefully clip them IF you can get help to hold the bird still (even a small amount of blood loss is a big deal to a bird). If it's a continuous problem, it may be a case for the vet though (beak/feather disease or similar).|`|CPxmHjx4aa	a budgies nails are pretty easy to cut...take clippers and you can see the blood lines in the nails...just cut off the tips..  also you can get this wrap around paper that has grit on it to help keep the birds nails short (it goes on the perches)..  some pet stores will assist in cutting the nails also|`|fNs20NZEaa	no you never cut them i thort i did but they will do it them selves are they will just do wat ours do|`|LElTSYaFaa	strap it down.. thn get the plyers out :)|`|WzKrZoHQaa	I think you can buy perch covers - basically these are sand paper so if you can glue some sandpaper to the perch - but no YOU should not touch yr birds nails with scissors at all.   Contact RSPB for help/advice|`|vwC7klVVaa	If your budgies claws seem long  and you have never trimmed them i would suggest you get you vet to do it. To help keep the claws down you should try and add natural fruit tree branches of different width also you can get sand covers for perches and also sandpaper for on the floor.|`|PjhN8IfXaa	buy him a rough stone or find a free one that's the natural way|`|9B1FVdnPaa	You can if you want, just get some clippers and cut them, but avoid a red line in the nail because that is the birds blood vessel, and if you cut it, the budgie will bleed to death. Budgies nails naturally wear down when they are on grit, i recommend you go and buy some. It can be put on the birds sand, and there are ones in a wrap which you can put on the perches.
WqGxGJkbaa	Give him an extra litter tray.  Many cats will not pee and poo in the same tray.  Make sure the litter is as soft as possible on his paws - this could be the reason why he is using plant pots because the soil is soft.  It needs to be as close to sand as possible and not scented in any way. To start with, you could try mixing a small amount of soil into the litter and then gradually decrease it until you are just using litter.  If you are using a hooded litter tray you should try taking the lid off as, again, these can be offputting to some cats.|`|Q87djE0laa	pick the poo out of the plant pot and put it in the litter tray and a bit of soil and if possible move the plants so he cant get to them|`|PWXLUTHmaa	Use a spray bottle with water in it and spray the cat whenever it does it. Cats like to bury their poop|`|LVsE65jiaa	try lemon or orange peels. cats don't like the smell of citrus. or at least most cats don't. it's something about the citrus oil. or you could try cayenne pepper or dried mustard.|`|AA11457471	I had the same problem. I put bricks in the pots over the dirt. Worked like a charm!|`|IzRk1mZQaa	Mix dirt in the kitty's litter.  It's hard to reform feral cats, so you are doing wonderful!!  Just use clean out of the bag potting or topsoil, use less and less every week, until kitty adjusts to all litter.  If worse comes to worse, because we really don't want Mom upset, buy a little squirt gun and give kitty a little squirt when she heads for the plants.  Orange peels in the dirt work for some, it's never worked for me.  You really want the cat out of the plants anyway, some houseplants are extremely poisonous to cats.  Good Luck!!!|`|AA11800048	Go to the Home and Garden/ Outdoor section of a department store like Wal-Mart, Target, K-mart, Meijer's, etc.  They have products (like a pepper oil) that people use to deter cats from spraying in their outdoor gardens/flower gardens.  Otherwise, make sure the cat's litter box is kept clean regularly.  Sorry, you can also spray water on the cat every time you catch it in the act to deter it.  You can also check pet stores or the pet section in department stores for cat repellents.
OxFsslN8aa	The worst thing you can do for your older dog is to sit with her & comfort her.  Your comforting (petting, soothing voice, "its OK") are all telling her that her behavior is OK.  You are reinforcing her fear.  Be an assertive pack leader & show the older dog that there is nothing to worry about because you are not worried.  Your dogs can pick up on your energy & if they sense that you think something is wrong then they will take on that anxiety.  You need to be calm & assertive.  Give the older dog a place to go & get away from the puppy but do not isolate the two for long periods of time.  Think of a wolf pack.  When a female has pups the whole pack checks them out but the mother wolf keeps them all in line - including the puppies.  She teaches the pups how to behave in the pack.  Teach your pup to leave the older dog alone when commanded to do so.|`|jSGRiA8Jaa	keeep them away from easchother for a while and then let her kinda get used to it she is not used to it thats all|`|1bRRODd2aa	She will eventually get used to the pup.      It will take time, just make sure that the fear doesn't turn into aggression.|`|ldXSIWEyaa	I just had this same problem, I just got a new puppy and my older dog was very scared also. It has taken about 3 weeks, and they are just starting to get used to each other. It will the puppy a little longer to start realizing that your older dog is scared, then the puppy will back off. Now my 2 dogs are playing together and jumping all over each other. I know its freezing where I live, but try and take the dogs out for a walk or to a field where they are both out of their comfort zone, offer them treats and show your older dog that it is ok.|`|niMim3jNaa	We're Shih Tzu breeders, and everytime we have a new litter, the older dogs are scared and the puppies want to play with them [or vice versa]. It's no biggie. We ended up keeping one of the puppies and eventually it grew on her and now they play. It's no big deal. Give it time, give them both love, and try convincing them to both play with the same toy, get down on the floor with them.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Is the puppy old enough to walk on a leash?    Its amazing how dogs who walk together bond - every time I bring a rescue home, I put everyone on a leash, and the whole pack takes a walk together.  Even when we start out with snarls and growls, by the time we get back from a long walk, everyone gets along.  Plus, a tired puppy will be less likely to bug your older dog :o)
ngrjFv72aa	Before you decide to change your bit take into account these few things:  Firstly, your seat( body position) is more important than your hands.are you getting tense/ nervous when he starts going too fast or when your riding in general, because he might be picking up on that. als you might be locking your hip out of tension and that prevents you from relaxing in your seat and getting him to slow down. also what might be happening is when he begins to accelerate you abandon him with your seat and just pull on him with your hands. by abandoning him with your seat you are pretty much getting him to think "oh she wants me to go faster? OK" a lot of this happens subconsciously so you might not realize it unless you really start paying attention.  i know that this might not sound like fun but a good thing to try in order to build your seat is dressage. it a miracle worker.  i hope  this helps|`|IMPvzBk1aa	A harsher bit is not the answer.  OTTBs have to be retrained since they have been trained to speed up when the bit is engaged.  Your horse is most likely confused, and the time hasn't been put in to un-train the racehorse and allow him the time and experience to learn what you are asking when you communicate through the bit.  Going to a leveraged bit is not about communication or training, but is a shortcut that is a bad idea, a disservice to your horse,  and I guarantee you it won't work.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Ugh.    You do not need a Pelham or a Waterford, or any other big nasty bit.  If your horse is not listening to your aids, you need to change your riding style.  Bitting him up with something that's going to turn him sour will not help.    Keep him in the mildest, double-jointed snaffle you can find, and adjust your riding.  It's never the horse's fault and he doesn't deserve to be punished with a harsh bit.|`|G8IRX295aa	I like those recommendations. I would suggest trying the waterford first.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I have an appaloosa that is extremely fast and headstrong. I used to simply use a full cheek on him. Now whenever I do something that is going to be outside of a ring, involve lots of cantering, or required jumpsing (which gets him excited) I use a Kimberwick bit. It use a chain chin strap attached to it as well, because I need to be able to control him on a fox hunt, but that is optional. I think it is a good bit because you have the option of two reins or just one. Although beware I'm pretty sure it is not dressage legal.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Instead of relying on a bit you should really do some more training with your horse. Your seat is what is supposed to slow your horse, not your hands.    Rough bits with OTTBs will make them high headed and crabby.|`|6GehblM3aa	You don't need a stronger bit, especially if you are going to be using it as "breaks".  There could be a few reasons to why he is doing this.  It could be that he needs more training, or maybe you need to work on what your doing wrong (position, aids, etc.).      First start off in the walk with her. Make sure your seat bones are "straight down" in the saddle, because if you have them curled under yourself, it's giving her a driving aid. Remember, shoulders back, back straight, and no bracing with your legs (it truly makes a difference). At the walk, stay relaxed as possible and talk to her if it helps. Then ask her to come to a halt. DO NOT pull on the reins, this needs to be done with your seat and leg (keep a light contact with her mouth). If she does not stop, keep walking until you reach the wall/fence so she stops. Be ready in case she turns to the side quickly. Repeat this until she is stopping before the wall, then tell her she is the most wonderful horse in the whole world and end the lesson on a good note. When you feel she is ready for trot, do trot walk (halts even better) transitions. The same rules apply in the trot as they did in the walk. Trot a few steps and ask for the walk or halt. If she doesn't stop, keep asking until you reach the wall and she stops. Repeat until she is walking and/or halting before the wall, pat her, and end on a good note.     Apply this to your canter work when she starts to become to fast.  Remember, stronger bits only shadow a problem, they don't actually correct it.|`|FrqKyNdAaa	Please don't change your bit because your horse isn't doing exactly what you want. Look for other possible reasons and maybe he just needs some more training. Perhaps he's not well suited for showing hunters.  Have you looked into all the training you can and used the appropriate cues?   Best of luck with slowing him down!|`|4gYQnfL7aa	kimberwick or a pelham.|`|0b14b66fafd5928f711f122a8c5b6c08aa	Check if the bit you are using is the same as the one he was raced in. If it is, he may associate it with going as fast as he can in the canter. Before you switch to a more severe bit,  try switching to a different bit of the same severity. also, if he has a good stop and is legal in shows(i don't ride english, so i don't know) try a bitless bridle. If you still get no response, then move up in severity. Try the waterford first. I don't like pelham bits, personally; I don't think a snaffle should ever be used like a curb or have leverage added, unless used by a professional or a trainer. And please, never use the pelham with just one set of reins.  'Jointed mouthpieces increase the pressure on the bars due to the nutcracker action of the mouthpiece. In addition, the joint angle is altered by the shank leverage to tip the bit downward and into the tongue.' -http://www.answers.com/topic/curb-bit  and check with other people who have retrained OTTBs.|`|EaNjIhoQaa	I've heard a lot of good things about the Waterford. I would definitely try that one.|`|jpqt4KEhaa	I wouldn't change my bit I would change my training and riding of the horse. It sounds to me like you need to go back to the basics of training and teach impulsion slowing down and in turn speeding up in each gate.     Say you change your bit to different bit and then he learns to run through that one too. So you go to the tack store and look for a different more aggressive bit and then he will learn to run through that one too. What are you going to do when there are no bits left at the store. I never use anything more than a Snaffle or a halter bridle, because my horses have enough training that they slow down when I tell them too.|`|nlsvqLj5aa	PLEASE do not use either of those bits - they are not needed. I ride a warmblood gelding who used to drag hunt in his youth, and is therefore quite speedy himself. Before I started riding him, he had the waterford bit in. He had it for about a year longer, and I was just not getting anywhere with him, and it used to cut his mouth, which made him even more difficult to stop. Instead, he was put on a calming supplement that he has in his hard feed, and he has a loose ring snaffle. He is a completely different horse now, and does not need a strong bit. I recommend you check what your horse is being fed and make sure he isn't getting too much energy that he doesn't need, and also, try a snaffle and a running martingale.
zb3ImEQ6aa	What you are looking for falls in the LGD category or Livestock Guardian Dog. They generally will not fight the predator  but they are large and cause a ruckus which will frighten the wild animal off. we have Coyotes and bobcats in this area. And Coyotes will attack a  dog under 10 pounds as well a bobcat  the general rule is if it is smaller then they are it is prey. LGD's are bred specifically to discourage wild predators from coming in your yard  near your flock  or herd. There are several breeds that fall into that category if you do a web search the breeds as well as additional information to help you decide which breed is best for your family will be available. Hope this helps. Oh and PS  Great Danes  are not gaurd dogs..  trust me i have 3  and if something comes in my yard..  they will run and hide and wait for me to chase it off... You dont want a cattle type dog that will herd it or give chase as that could provoke it to attack.  The most well-known of these breeds in the United States are the Great Pyrenees, Anatolian Shepherds, Akbash and Maremma|`|AA12128656	i have a 9mm and that does just fine for furry attackers.    setting your dog up to be torn up by coyotes and bobcats is cruel. and trust me, they're wild animals, and will more than likely win, or at least cause enough damage to the dog to require extensive surgery or euthanasia.     better to teach your dog to bark, then you can go out and shoot the intruders.      blunt- believe it or not, we have coyotes in my area who will attack and kill dogs when they are very hungry. my friend shot 2 who killed his dog and were going after his chickens.|`|AA10283080	Well I doubt a bobcat would attack a dog unless it's cornered or rabid but a pack of coyotes will attack a dog if they're hungry enough or if the dog poses a threat. People who assume otherwise are obviously ignorant to the way coyote packs work. And yes, they live and hunt in packs. The rule of thumb when dealing with coyotes is if you see one alone it's probably been ousted from it's pack for some reason or is sick.    I would suggest a dog as big as or larger than your lab. Although size doesn't always determine how brave a dog is I'd say a dog near the same size as your present dog would be a better match for your dog. Take the time to secure your backyard where the dogs will be so that you won't have to deal with them coming into direct contact with your dogs.    (My great dane hides behind our couch when he hears the coyote's and my little mixed rescue always alerts me...they're sheer entertainment!)|`|qioH81tiaa	That is a REALLY bad reason for getting a second dog.

Wild animals don't usually come anywhere near a large dog; so the "fending off" bit isn't really necessary.

Think about an Australian Cattle dog or a German Shepherd, a smooth coat would be best because of the heat...    Don't leave the dogs outside at night. Get yourself a gun, learn how to use it.

These dogs are also very good pets to have around.  I would recommend that you find one that someone was getting rid of because it wasn't a very good hunting dog.  It will still have the natural instincts to protect and bay but wouldn't be good enough for most hunters.  I hunted plott for a bit and love the breed, plus they are gorgeous brindled hounds.  I would go to ukcdogs.com and go to the big game hound message board and post that you are looking for a plott hound that didnt make it as a hunter and want it for a pet.  There are also a lot of plotts that are bred for coyote hunting but a coyote dog is really expensive.  if you like this idea and have more questions, feel free to email me.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I'd vote for a Rhodesian Ridgeback (they're used in Africa to run off lions).  It is said that they kill lions by laying on their backs and acting submissive and then tear the lion's throat out.    SEE:  http://www.AKC.org -- Breeds|`|omHJO0uTaa	id say akita but i dunoo cos of their coat and the heat, maybe a shepherd breed.|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	I would suggest an Anatolian Shepherd Dog, or an Anatolian mix.  My own Anatolian X Alaskan Husky mix has protected his team mates from wolves - and wolves are much more formidable than a little ol' coyote or bobcat.
xoXkHOVsaa	You have to be zoned for them.  If you live in a residential area then you probably can't have one, if you live in the country it's more likely to be ok.    If you look in the newspaper classifieds there should be a section on animals for sale.  Or search online for breeders in alabama.  The pigs will probably be a few hundred dollars.
fdd66a0264611ab1286c9261b903a931aa	There are many options.  For me, the best is using a sharpened machete.  I create a cone shape made out of cardboard and stick the chicken in it head first.  The small end of the cone should have a hole in it large enough for the chicken to stick his head out of.  Once in this position, I tie the legs with a loose slipknot.  Then, I severe the head of the chicken with one powerful blow with the machete.  Be quick about it.  If the head doesn't come off, hit it again.  But normally the bird is dead with the first blow.  I use a machete rather than a hatchet because it is harder to miss with a machete.  Also, a machete can be sharpened to a nicer level.  The second the head is off, hang the chicken above a bucket to catch the draining blood.  Let it sit for several mins until the blood is drained and it stops twitching.  Sometimes I squeeze the chicken a bit like I am doing CPR to pump out some extra blood.  Dip the chicken in boiling water, then pluck.  Cleaning the chicken isn't that hard.  First, place the plucked chicken on its back.  Make a slit with a sharp knife just above the vent.  Don't cut too deep!  Then, work the slit open with you fingers until you can start pulling out the innards.  Once all is out, I cut out the vent completely to remove the intestine rather than ripping it out.  Remove the crop, windpipe, and whatever else may be in the front by going through the loose skin at the neck.  Wash it and put it in the refrigerator.  Do not freeze it until it sits for about two days.  Also, I prefer to let my chickens sit for two days before I eat it to let the stiffness come out a bit.|`|VPycXVIlaa	I just read a book where they discussed this. They suggested you put the chicken in a street cone type thing so it's head is sticking out. Then hold the chicken's head and turn in at an angle so the artery is exposed. Using a shape knife you slice only the artery. This is so the heart will continue to pump all the blood out of the body.    Once the chicken has bleed out you need to soak them in scalding water for a bit. This will loosen up the feathers. Pluck the feathers.    Then you remove the head and the feet. And eviscerate the chicken. You want to be careful not to rupture the spleen or in trails because it could leak bile into the carcase. If that happens make sure to rinse the chicken very well.     After store your chicken in ice water until you are done.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	use a sharp kinife and slit the throat|`|sfUUml0Daa	http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=...  hope it helped ^^|`|HZvdr8VLaa	http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/g...

m4uDn0ofaa	My breeder runs a Shiba Rescue and she sometimes has a cream colored one up for adoption.  I would check her:    http://www.royalkennels.com/    Good Luck!|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Shiba Inus are fairly uncommon so, chances are, you would have to buy one from a breeder or a rescue.  Make sure you research the breeder you are buying from-- Do not support back yard breeders or puppy mills!    Shiba Inus can be hard to train and have issues with other dogs if not socialized properly!  They are still fighting dogs in some countries.  So I would REALLY read about the breed before you look into buying one.|`|AA12226854	OK. First of all, Shibas are not now, nor have they EVER been fighting dogs.  They are HUNTERS.  All small game (rabbits, squirrels, etc) and birds, up to and including wild boar.  While we do not hunt them here in the US, they are still used in some of the more remote areas of Japan in that capacity.    Cream Shibas can be difficult, but not impossible, to find.  More and more breeders are admitting to producing them, and a quick stop by the National Shiba Club of America website will set you up with several breeders- hopefully in your area.  But do not be surprised if you have to travel outside your region.    PLEASE, do not purchase your Shiba from a pet store.  BYB puppies, found in pet stores, more often than not, do NOT have the required health checks on the parents, and you run a far greater risk of health issues in the long run.  Working with a breeder, you get a knowledge base to draw from.  Breeders routinely screen their dogs for all kinds of genetic health issues (hip dysplasia, subluxating patellas, eye disorders, etc), and can produce documentation that the parents of your puppy have been screened and CLEARED of any genetic issues that could affect the puppy's ability to live a long and healthy life.    Good luck with your search!
lyhnHhuWaa	Pre treat the bag with Nature's Miracle for cats then clean it as you would normally.  It's an enzymatic cleaner that's designed to eliminate cat urine odors, and I've found it to be an excellent product.  You can purchase it at most any pet supply store, but won't find it in grocery or discount stores.  They do have different formulas, so be sure to get the one that reads "for cats".  Follow the instructions on the container for pre treating cloth and it should do the trick.  Personally, I would hand wash it after treating with Nature's Miracle to avoid getting the leather strap wet.  Let it air dry and the odor should be gone.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	try either white vinegar or a cat urine/stain remover spray (can be bought at a pet store, or even wal-mart).  since it is leather, i would spot test and area to make sure it's not going to ruin the purse any further.|`|YyXtxeNGaa	First question, how valuable is the purse to you?  It could take considerable time, energy, and money to remove the smell if it is bad enough.  Even then there is no guarantee that the odor will not linger.  Also bear in mind that you might get used to the odor and the odor might still be there for your friends to "enjoy".    Just be glad he did not spray the seats of your car.  I speak from experience!!!
IuYekkPVaa	Never understimate how much territory means to a cat.  Its the source of all the things that they need (love, food and shelter) to survive and they won't abandon a good one without a fight.  During a lifetime of keeping cats in the UK, I have never had one that got injured outside or went missing.    This advice is taken from the Blue Cross web site;    "Choose a dry day (if possible) and a quiet time and accompany your kitten outside, allowing your pet to explore their new environment. Continue to accompany your kitten until they are used to your garden and can find their way back to the house without difficulty. Do not leave your kitten alone outside until after neutering."    Neutered cats don't wander far and letting him outside on an empty stomach will also help ensure that he stays close to home as he'll be worried about missing out on his next meal.  Keep him indoors overnight as that is when most road accidents occur.      There are ways of cat-proofing your garden so that he can't leave it's boundaries and this link explains how to do that.    http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/in...    If your budget allows, there are ready made fences that prevent cats from leaving your garden.    http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Do NOT let him outside to roam unsupervised until he is neutered!  He will take off and breed females in heat.    And after he is nuetered I recommend you let him outside only under supervision and not just to roam and not know where he is or what problems/trouble he may be in.|`|dfe0268d59e51b8e7c2861c0cbc917b9aa	I would never ever let my cats outside!|`|zeTGmB3faa	I can't reassure you because of the many outdoor hazards, especially the main street. At seven months , he is used to the security of indoor life and has no idea how to act or react to the dangers. Keep him in to prevent accidents, dog or cat fights, poisons or one of the many disasters that could occur. If you wish to take him outside, leash train him and take him for short walks. Or just put him on a longer leash and let him smell the roses so to speak and search the area.But you will need to stay with him the entire time so he doesn't get tangled. He will be fine as an indoor cat.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Why would you let him out? You're very right to worry that he will get hurt or killed!    How about keeping your kitten safely indoors? It'll be much healthier for your kitten to be indoors where it's safe from poisons, loose dogs, other cats, cars, wild animals, malicious people... and so on (the list of dangers is quite long). Indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats and it's very possible to have a happy, well entertained indoor cat. It's also entirely possible to train a cat to walk on a harness/leash for safe outdoor trips.

As for him not coming back, most cats ar very cautious when they first go outside so he may only go a few steps on his first couple of outings and will see his home as a safety net and should always return.  Good luck|`|VeJH9b2yaa	going by what i have had done to my pup its usually 5 days to 14 days after the SECOND jab. if you have an enclosed garden that you are sure other animals have not been on then place your kitten on a training lead and let it out for now.. until then keep it safe. its not worth it. i know how you feel as my pup had so much energy it needed walks. BUT wait.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	No cat should ever be let outdoors freely.  If you want him to be outdoors you need to have him in an enclosure.  The outdoors are dangerous for pets on the loose.|`|0GkNHLbsaa	I was the exact same way with my cats, never wanted them to leave just in case, now im happier knowing they can run around in the fresh air and climb trees everyday and even if one mite not come home at night, they will always come home at some stage, i don't need to worry anymore about my 8mnts old kitten she always comes home, however were not that close to the main road so were lucky that way. Cats are not that stupid though they wont want to be near all the traffic it will frighten them anyway.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Hi i let my kitten out at around 4 months old,the sooner the better so that he can get used to it, and get to know his territory,otherwise the other local cats will see him as a threat and start to pick on him, he needs to claim his patch now! as not to have these problems later on!he will come back, as they can sniff there way home.good luck.|`|1bRRODd2aa	You need to teach your cat where its home is and how to find its way back home before you let it "out".  Take your cat out on a harness and long line to start with and introduce it to the whole garden so he learns the sights and smells of his territory.  Do this for at least a week, every day.      After he learns his garden, then to start with, let him out just before you feed him let him roam a short while then call him back in for his food. Get him used to being called in.  For the first few days he's out, call him back frequently. This serves two purposes, he learns the various ways back home, and if he ever does get lost, then he will know to follow your voice home.    As for the road, that is a lottery - he will either learn about cars or he won't, it's the major risk you run when you decide to have an "outdoor" cat.    As for trees, you will also have to teach him how to get back down a tree. I hope for your sake, that the first tree he gets stuck in is a small one...  Teach him how to climb down from branch to branch and use his claws - a tin of tuna or cat food helps here...    I suggest that you feed him at night.  This has two purposes, he will come home for his food, and you will then be able to shut him in for the night.  Most cats get killed at night, he will be safest as a "daytime" cat.  In the early days, you will probably have to call him in at the end of the day, so that he can find his way home from his adventuring.|`|mR5RkClpaa	i have two cats they dont get out one is 19 years old, i live in a flat  no garden  , had i a garden i would not let them out either, except in a closure or a run, it is far too dangerous, in this day and age motors are every where, then u have other prey foxes, let them sit in sun  in a cat run ,or one of those leads with plenty scope to move about, it is not worth it  w alk in any supermarket, and you will see loads of cat foods, which means there are thousands of cats, but do we ever see the cats no, people are scared to let them out,unless you have a big house and garden in the country it is not worth it,so how many cats have you seen this week on your daily comings and going i know i have not saw one|`|3bpCc5j3aa	I felt really worried about leaving our kittens out for the first time too.      I was worried that they wouldn't come back, or that they would not know to avoid the road.  But, I did think that letting them out was very important, so we did it anyway.    We waited until they'd had all their jabs, and had been spayed and microchipped, then had a couple of weeks to get over the operation.    It was totally the right thing to do.  Our kittens (now 8 months) were so excited when we first let them out - they were properly exploring.  We thought that we played with them a lot in the house, and they ran around a lot, so they got a lot of exercise - but after we let them out, we realised just how tired they were in the evening after spending all day exploring.      The automatically knew to stay away from the noise of the road, and they don't actually venture all that far yet - they just come in and out of the cat flap at regular intervals.  If the cat flap is shut (we keep them in at night), they miaow at it until we open it for them.    Their excitement made me realise it was totally the right thing to do.  I do still worry about them, I think that's natural, but they totally love it.  They will be fine...let them be cats|`|iDxoM3X8aa	You can never be sure they will be safe but they do learn fast you could let him out once he recovers from the vets. i have two cats they go out they are 7years old my sister has 2 cats who are 12years old all of them are safe you just have to hope they will be okey you and the cat will get use to him being out hope he gets on good luck.

s6YmD7vaaa	Thank goodness you're not one of those idiots who refrain from taking their dog to the vet when there's a problem!      Now follow the vet's advice & get her "examined inside."  But I'd take her to another vet for a 2nd opinion.  There is definitely something wrong - & it may be the fault of the vet who did the surgery!  You hear all the time how surgeons for humans make mistakes.  Perhaps your surgical vet left a sponge or something inside your dog, which is why he wants to "examine her inside."  If it's something like that, would the surgical vet even tell you?  Get a 2nd opinion - & if the first vet screwed up make him pay for the 2nd vet - & all the expenses incurred by his screw up!    Good Luck & I hope your dog will be okay!|`|um5CVvTfaa	Some dogs are allergic to the suture material.  Their bodies try to purge it from the system causing excess fluid which tends to leak.  My vet has had to go in and change out internal stitches due to allergy.|`|f1AvsgCDaa	call your vet, it could be infected, if you dont hurry, your dog could die|`|OxFsslN8aa	Let the vet examine her.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Oh no that sounds horrible.  Its probably white blood cells which accumulate to fight off infection and attempt to heal the wound.  Is your dog licking the wound?  Most do, and the stitches keep opening.  If you have a small dog, maybe you could get a doggy shirt/sweater for her, then put some gauze and tape it over the wound, and put the sweater on her so she can't lick it. If its a big dog, I am sure it will be strong enough to pull of the shirt anyways.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Eek, not good! Sounds infected. It won't be milk leaking from a wound, it will be pus or some kind of sero-sanguinous fluid. Wounds don't heal when they're infected, or if the dog's immune system is compromised in some way that stops them from healing. This wound sounds infected; it won't stop leaking until the infection is cleared up and the wound can't heal until the infection is cleared.    The wound should be long healed by now as you'll be aware. The vet will want to see inside to see what the cause of the continual wound breakdown is. Has she been on antibiotics all this time? I think she probably should have been. Bear in mind that you can take her to another vet for a second opinion any time you're not satisfied with the treatment she's receiving.    Chalice    EDIT: Oh yes - and do not ever let your dog lick the wound! This has got to be the number one reason for post-op wound breakdown. Dogs have bacteria in their mouths, licking it will cause infection, so keep her away from it at all costs.|`|024f046dd145f6d7ab314e8ad45af5f8aa	could be infected and you need the vet to look at it again. you may also want to get her cone (e-collar)?,that goes around her  head so can't get the wound to lick it.|`|zb3ImEQ6aa	If she is tearing out her sutures you can ask your vet for a cone to put over her head to keep her from licking and chewing. Also keep her relatively inactive to keep her form pulling them out further. Ask your vet about topical ointments which might help with healing infection and keep down some of the itch from healing . If you vet wants to open her back up and see what else might be wrong request an X-Ray (which they might want to already take) and see if there is any way to avoid an exploratory surgery.  Clear Liquid leakage is actually normal after surgery  but after 3 weeks she should be well on her way to healing. It seems her reopening of the wound if causing her a lot of complications. Getting her to leave it a lone and allow it to heal is probably your best bet. If your taking her to the vet everyday and shes being restitched that's a lot of work time stress and money.|`|1cTQxZHcaa	Let them examine her inside.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Not necessarily ... you need to ask your Vet what kind of fluid your Vet thinks it is and WHY your Vet wants to examine her inside????    Have your Vet pinpoint what they think is going on and if you're not getting satisfactory answers, find out what University near you has a Vet School and schedule an appointment with them to see your dog.    You dog should have been completely closed on the outside in 10-14 days provided that the dog isn't ripping stitches.
un0gLSXKaa	No.. I wouldnt feed him when he's not hungry.  Usually dogs go to the bathroom right after walks.  Its obnoxious i know!    So after you get dont from your walks stand outside your house for a little while and wait for it to happen..    Don't leave his food out.  Feed him and take away the bowl.  Eating should be when he's hungry, not when he feels like eating.  Feed him earlier in the day.  after you get home from work or whatnot.  If he doesnt eat for a whole day.. eating when you get home will be a good reinforcement for him.. and he'll start learning that he gets fed at that time.      Take him on a walk, or take him outside to go a couple hours after he eats.  I know its hard not just to go home and rest after a long walk.. but make sure he goes to the bathroom before you get inside your house..  and use 'go pee'  or 'do your business'  when he goes to the bathroom and praise him when he does... after a while of consistancy he'll start recognizing his routine and that after walks.. when you say do your business he knows he has to go to the bathroom before going home...     Its not going to happen immediatly.. but the key is to be consistant!    good luck!|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Establish a schedule for feeding.  The dog will get used to being fed at that time and eliminating soon after.  *Always* (as much as possible) feed the dog at that time.  Put the food down.  Leave it for ten or 15 minutes and if he hasn't finished, take it up.      It sounds like he's establishing his own schedule which doesn't fit in with yours very well.  Dogs will not starve themselves.  If they know the food is going to go away if they don't eat it, they will.  It's a lot easier to stick to a housebreaking schedule, too, if you always feed at the same time (on *your* schedule).|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Try a new food or add "dog gravy" to the food to entice him into eating it. I had the same problem when I switched to the one/day feeding schedule. I actually ended up mixing a smal amount of smelly wet food in with the dry food, until I discovered Merrick Turduken (which my dog goes CRAZY for). The general rule is to only leave the food down for 10-15mins. Make the feeding time the same everyday and keep a potty schedule, as well. My dog poops about 45mins after eating then again first thing in the morning.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Feeding twice a day is better than once in teh evening. Give a smaller amount 2x a day, once in the morning & once at dinner hour. If he doesn't eat it, after a little bit, take it away. he will learn to eat while it is there. Perhaps you could try offering a different food as well, he may not like the taste or is bored with it. I would feed him in the moiring & his evening meal around 6, no later. That way he would have time for a poop before bed. He is recently uprooted form the shelter & this is all new to him, he needs a chance to settle down & get comfortable & routine is best to help him.

1bRRODd2aa	You should not even start agility training before the dog is 12 months old, you shouldn't even consider competing before she is 15 months old.    Floor work, you can start that now at 10 months.    Obedience is a good basis for all the other activities you suggest.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Your dog needs to be 15-18 months to start competing, depending on the venue.  I started off taking classes at a local training center.  Obedience is the first step, and you are already doing that.  Hopefully where you are taking, they can refer you to someone who trains agility.  Check out Cleanrun.com.  They have listings of agility clubs and really great articles.  The venues you can compete in, are to name a few, AKC, CPE, USDAA, NADAC.    Good luck, it's addicting!|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Hi there my daughter started in agility at age 7 she's now 14 and loves it, I have been competing for 12 years. There are a lot of things that you can do at home. Some skills that your puppy will need is an excellent recall (come), sit and down. You can teach targeting skills that are used later for teaching contacts. Get the lid from a small yogurt or sour cream container make sure its nice an clean. Find a place where you can do a little training without distraction, and have lots of yummy treats, like hotdogs, or string cheese or extra special dog cookies (use these treats only for training). Put the lid on the floor in front of your puppy and wait. Everytime she looks at the lid praise and give a cookie, you might want to use what is called a "marker word" its a word to mark a good behavior I use the word YES!" For example: Puppy looks at lid "YES!" give cookie, she looks again "YES" give cookie. She sniffs the lid "YES" and jackpot (lots of cookies. You want her to touch the lid with her nose. Once she starts touching it with her nose as soon as its on the floor, you want to add a command word like Touch or Target, I use POKE like poke it with your nose. When she is reliably touching/targeting on the floor, you can hold it in your hand and ask her to target the lid in your hand, hold it in different positions. You can ask your dad to get you a 6 -9 ft long board about 9-12 inches wide lay it on the ground and let her walk on it, when shes comfortable doing that then place a broom stick under the board so it tips a little and have her walk over it. There are so many things you can do while looking for an instructor. I am guessing that you are in the UK by the name of the town you are in. Unfortunately Im in the US so cant help with the training club end of things. Good Luck its alot of fun and if you have any questions please feel free to email me. One more very important thing, NO jumping over jumps until she is older and her growth plates have closed around 14 months is usually ok|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Congrats on being one of those people that wants to stay active with their dog!!    First off, you're on the right path.  Before you start agility, you need to have a good foundation in obedience.  Your dog will need to be off-leash to do agility, so making sure you have good focus and especially a good recall are important.  Obedience will help you get there.  By focus, I mean, you need your dog to be concentrating on you and what you want even when there are a lot of people and other dogs around.  That comes with doing a lot of obedience type things in settings with a lot of distractions.  Training for agility will also help build that focus.    Pups shouldn't do jumps until they are at least a year old, but that doesn't mean that your dog can't start agility.  You can start any time, but you'll enjoy it more and get more out of an agility class if you have some of that focus and obedience down before you do.  Look around for a training club.  Many have puppy agility classes that focus on building focus and teamwork between you and your pup and learning some of the non-jump obsticles.  (You can never start weaves too early.)  Once you're pup is a year old, he can start on jumps.      You might want to check with your Kennel Club to see if there are any training classes they know of.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Obedience classes is a good start.  Conformation classes (beauty contest) is also a good thing.  They have Junior Handler divisions in both.  Heel work to music is called Canine Freestyle and once your dog is somewhat obedient, you can start in that.  There are Puppy Agility Classes; however, a dog should not be forced to jump until it is 2 years old and has had its hips checked for soundness.    Cockers love to please their owners, so you should have a wonderful show career ahead of you!    Good luck and much success in your endeavors!|`|2c864bf754de60c67fb58c4bc031c57aaa	Good for you for wanting to do something fun with your puppy. You can start agility at any age, you just can't compete and they won't allow you to jump over any jumps. All jumps will have the bars resting on the floor so that your puppy can learn to jump over the jump without damaging any growing parts. They also won't allow things like the A frame but they will work your puppy on other equipment that is acceptable at your puppy's age and as your puppy gets older you can start to incorporate the equipment that you had to bypass earlier. There are many websites that will help you find an agility club nearby. Here in Canada we have many puppy obedience classes that have a puppy agility class attached, so the owners can see if they and their puppy like the idea.  You may have something like that in your area. Talk to dog trainers and agility clubs and I'm sure someone will be able to point you in the right direction.      Have fun with your puppy!!
FjZqcaNDaa	they are just playing. buy your dog a dried pig ear. that will keep him occupied|`|FnrAw2SQaa	it can be for alot of reasons....one resaon is he wants attention...if it hurts your female dog invest in some rawhide bones...:]|`|AA12128656	there could be different reasons behind it, my 7 month old pups do it, my female chews (gently) on my 15 year old lab's ears to show affection before she lays down with him, and her brother chews at his uncle's ears (harder) when he wants to play.   this can also be a pup testing its boundaries. he'll find out when the other dog's had enough...    if it's more than a gentle chewing, or the other dog's ears are becoming injured or inflamed, see the vet.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Because he likes to ...

YyXtxeNGaa	Often change in potty disposition can be stress related.  Another possibility is that she might have been scared while outside doing her business.  If you were sitting on your toilet minding your own business and some stranger barged in and chased you around the shower, you might think twice about using that bathroom again.  I'd have the vet check her out.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	sounds like she is getting wiser.  just clean the litter box once or twice a day and if you are worried about anything call the vet.|`|zeTGmB3faa	She sounds like an older cat and has decided that it is time for the easy life and wants to stay inside. For her health and safety, keep her in. She deserves to be babied now and enjoy the luxe life. Since she is on the medication, make sure that she sees the vet regularly for blood and urine checks and possible med adjustments.|`|FOLjr8G9aa	cats are very clean animals, they won't poop outside unless they absolutly need to. she is probably getting fatter and heavier since then because she hasn't been running around outside much anymore. she must be getting olf if she has arthritis. I don't think it's the medicine, the arthritis is probably hurting her to run. help her exercise by getting a laser pointer. keep taking good care of her, and just a few exercising tips, and a little litter tarining will hav her as good as new!  Piper|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Yes, it will almost certainly be the arthritis which is causing the "problem", although its not really a problem is it as you have done the right thing and given her back a litter tray.  You might find that in warmer weather she feels able to go outside again, but whilst it is cold she will feel stiff and will associate going outside with the resulting pain.    Her medication could also be a contributing factor.  If she is taking steroids (possibly Prednisolone or Dexamethasone) for her arthritis then these will cause weight gain.  If she is taking a non steroidal anti inflamatory (possibly something like Metacam) these can occasionally cause stomach upsets and so again she might be associating the pain with having to go outside.  If she is more happy and comfortable going inside then stick with it.|`|1bRRODd2aa	It's cold and wet outside. She has arthritis so the weather makes this more painful so she prefers to use a litter box inside.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No Angelfish - your tank is far too small for Angels, they need 30-35 gallons minimum for one, and that tank to be at least 18" in height.    The Dwarf Gourami may be bothered and even nipped by the Neons and Danios as the Neons and Danios are not in their proper shoal numbers.    The Dwarf Frog may work but they can be quite sensitive and would need to be target fed food like bloodworms. You would have to make sure you got an African Dwarf Frog and NOT and African Clawed Frog which would grow large enough to eat the other fish. The Dwarves DON'T come in albino.    The 2 Platys are probably the more sensible option here.|`|jaAolejUaa	add a janitor fish|`|qccAwCoUaa	a sucker fish|`|2s82NH6Zaa	None, I'd go with a piranha.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Angel fish will get too large for this tank.   Dwarf Gourami will be too large  Dwarf frog, possibly, but they tend to require a little different care and food.  Platy's, possible, but no more than 2 and be sure they are both males.    Really, if i added anything to this tank, it would be a couple cory cats. All of these fish are really better kept in groups of 6 or more, but you just don't have the space for that. Right now, you are close to maxed out.=|`|aFslyRbMaa	here is web site it helps alot|`|dg2el4SPaa	My older sister's boyfriend own's a Fish store, so he says add a dwarf frog. They get along with thos type of fish you have.|`|Zs9ardfVaa	in our fish tank we had the same fish as you. we aslo had Orange Gumpies. the cute. all of the fish we had were freindly with each. salt water fish should not be put inton a fresh water tank. i even had a fresh water shark in the tank. it didn't even attack.    other good fish to put in the fish are:   Betas(they don't move around a lot)  RainBow Fish(don't get one enless you want all of your fish to be food)  Angel Fish (they are the ones with long wiskers types of things on there faces. they a good to be put in.)  Agle eaters( they are really exellence they eat the algea at the bottom of the fish tank)    these were all the different type of fish we had    Hope this helps
aSoCKVJ3aa	I've found a great article for you!   http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    I hope this helps, 'cause I know this must be stressful for you as well as your Little Bear.     You must be a cat lover to have 4 of them. :)|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	Fix a nest for him with some of your dirty clothes (t-shirt, towel, etc).  Put him there or show him when you leave.  Your clothes will be full of your scent and give him comfort.  Pretty soon he will fall into your schedule, realize that you are coming back and hopefully all will be well.  I do this with my when I leave for the weekend.  When I come there are definite signs of cat hair on the dirty clothes.  When they have to be at the vets for a day or longer, I send a dirty t-shirt with them.  The vet says that this is very comforting for them.|`|IuYekkPVaa	We tend to play a maternal role in the lives of our cats.  We want to comfort and protect them, but in the case of an emotionally incompetent cat, this is just compounding their insecurities and reinforcing clingy behaviour.    This suggestion may sound mean, and will probably be harder for you than it is for him, but you have to be a little less available to him. All affection should be initiated by yourself and not the cat. The problem with cuddling an anxious pet is that we are teaching them that they will be rewarded if they are anxious or cry for attention. Any prolonged cuddling sessions need to be gradally reduced in both duration and frequency.   Feeding, grooming and caring duties should be shared amongst all the family members so as to spread his loyalties. This will help him become more independent and competent in coping with life when you are not there. Act like nothing is happening while you prepare to leave and exit calmly.     Have nerves of steel for a short period and you will be able to turn things around. Most pets with separation anxiety are very excited when the owner returns. Their greeting behaviour is excessively exuberant. Often we mistakenly encourage this behaviour because we believe it means the pet loves us deeply. Unfortunately, encouraging exuberant greetings cause pets to be more anxious when we are away rather than to reassure them that we will return. Though you may feel guilty, it's best to ignore him for a few minutes after returning, and greet him when he is calm.    Hope this helps.|`|TvDubaNxaa	play with toys then leave the toys with you when you go. Try to help him build a bond with your other pets. Your boyfriend should try to pet the cat and or feed them when you go out. Try your best, if you gave him up he would miss you very much.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Well you can't fix this! He is a needy cat. Most of the very needy ones are males and just need attention constantly. I had a cat that would have been happy if I carried him around 24 hours a day. No kidding. This is the way he is and nothing is going to change him. Look at it this way. He thinks that you are just the most wonderful person in the world and loves you so much.|`|ArBOK95aaa	you could spend some time playing with him before you leave for work, and again when you come home.  wear him out so that he is more inclined to sleep or relax while you are gone.  Feed a meal after you play with him to also encourage that.    I find ways to distract my kitties when I am leaving for the day.  I might throw some treats or a toy down the hall to get them interested in something else instead of my departure.    you can also look into some herbal supplements for help. Bach's flower essences do help cats a lot.  There are ones for letting go, and for gaining confidence.  read up on them, or go and talk to the staff at your local health food store for some help in choosing one that will help you.  They also make a rescue remedy which I love.  I call it courage in a bottle.     if it is really bad, you can talk to your vet about a little chemical help.  Kitty prozac if you will (ok so it is straight prozac.. but in kitty sized doses) or some other medicine that will help calm your kitty.|`|60mDEusiaa	I think if you just leave him for a short amount of time(few minutes), and then come back, he will realize that you are coming back. It may take a while for him to realize that you are coming back.    Edit:My mom had a chihuhua that had separation anxiety. She had to work long hours and keep her in the laundry room. The puppy tore up the linoleum and so she gave her to her mom. Her mom had a lot more time to devote to the dog.
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	I'd have to say Tokay geckos and alligators are the two most vocal reptiles. Tokay geckos gave geckos their name... during their courtship period, the males do this call... "AH-AH-AH-GECK-O-GECK-O" hard to describe typing it out, but it's loud enough to wake you up. As for alligators, (and other crocodilians, but gators are the most vocal) this page has audio clips of most of their vocalizations: http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/croccomm.h...    Many other geckos will give little squeaks when they feel threatened or during courtship, a wide variety of snakes hiss, and some tortoises grunt and squeak during breeding.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	They hiss and/or honk, and sometimes they bellow!|`|Sc3RNbh3aa	I have small leopard geckos and when they get annoyed/angry (like when you're trying to help them finish shedding and they don't want to be held) they will make this weird almost croaking noise.

1bRRODd2aa	If your cat is female, not neutered and yowling, then she's in heat and calling for a male.    If your cat is male and not neutered, then there is a female in heat somewhere within 5 miles and he's calling to her.|`|ArBOK95aaa	because he's probably bored.    Spend some time before you to go to bed playing with him, getting him (or her you didn't say) running around with a fishing pole type toy and wear him out.  Then right before you to go bed, feed him his evening meal.    that SHOULD get you through the night.    What ever you do, do not encourage the behavior by responding to it.  Ignoring your cat will go further to discourage behavior you do not want  than yelling or scolding your cat.    if your cat is more than two years old, and this is a new behavior, you might want to consider a trip to the vet.  New behaviors can be a sign of ill health.  The older the cat is, the higher the risk of "old cat disease"  where your cat seems to lose it's mind, or high blood pressure - another reason a cat cries out at night|`|76d029948fad88b869e9be6cff719b72aa	Is she spayed?

sLMVnQvmaa	HECK YEAH!  I am doing some research online about getting a rat as my daughters first pet (we have dogs, cats, fish and turtles), she said she would like something she can be a mommy to...  I was thinking to myself that the bigger the better when it came to cages but all cages that are made for rats are just not impressive. Is that the Ferret Mansion? Would you mind telling me what kind of cage it is and where (and how much) it came from???  Thanks,  Ronny|`|q2u5w69eaa	Hi there---    That looks like the best of cages your rats must love you for it, i am sure mine would (if i had some)    Good luck|`|dlUof4cnaa	yeh def, specially as its for rats! perfecto u have some ver happy ratties!!  wot r they called??  my gerbils have a gerbilarium, but they just bury their toys!!|`|SnFGkqcZaa	i think it is|`|syFLorK2aa	It looks like a wonderful rat home.     Not really so well suited to gerbils though because they need lots of bedding to dig in and can not have fabrics in their cages because they will chew them and may accidentally swallow some. A Syrian hamster might enjoy that cage, but the fabric can be a concern for hamsters who like to chew everything (some won't) and they tend to prefer floor space to height. They would probably also prefer there to be some bedding to dig around in, most hamsters enjoy digging (although it isn't as essential for them as it is for gerbils).  Dwarf hamsters would probably struggle to reach things such as the wheel because of the scale of the cage, they are much better suited to having a large floor space with no long drops - such as from the wire ladders and second levels which are a bit high for dwarfs. If they fell while climbing them they may be seriously injured.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	It would be paradise for a rat, hamster or gerbil. The bars are too far apart for mice.|`|xtRm5NV5aa	I am jealous of your rats - it's way nicer than where I'm living!|`|FbSV4x7faa	It looks awesome but I had a Hamster once and we named it Cherry and she died because we think because she had the bars on her cage she kept chewing on them trying to get off to escape(she was ahppy though we treated her right and fed her and everything etc.)and we think she died from stress trying to get out of her cage just warning you...    I Hope that i helped!
bUNrQVQyaa	Look I don't understand why people have to be so rude, if someone wants to breed there dog, let them. Yeah theirs a lot of dogs in shelters but you know what? Not everyone wants a pitbull. I have a Siberian Husky male, and his girlfriend is about to have puppies real soon. Just look into online, ask around see how it is, don't just jump right into it, make sure you're aware of the situation well.  good luck :)|`|nYv65TlEaa	omg,wrong site to ask that question    you need a mentor,a breeder who is AKC/CKC    know all the problems that can happen    here is a site to ask thee question,they can't put you down,but you will have to be more specific in asking questions    http://allexperts.com/askq_result3.asp|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Are you sure you buddy's male is regisered?

Above ALL|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Why on earth would you even think about breeding when you don't have a clue?   You do know that millions of dogs are euthanized in shelters each year because of backyard breeders like yourself!    First of all, the dog needs to be at least two years old.  She needs to have all of her health and genetic testing done.  You need a breed mentor.  Your dog needs to have earned her breed championship.  You will need upwards of $2000.00 should your dog need an emergency c-section.  You do know that your dog could possibly lose her life due to pregnancy/whelping problems.  Your dog will need regular vet check ups and an ultrasound.  You need a legal contract stating that you offer a health guarantee and that you'll take back a pup at any time, for any reason.      PLEASE SPAY YOUR DOG.  NO ONE WITH A DECENT MALE IS GOING TO BREED TO YOUR *****.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	No dog should be bred before he or she is at least 2 years old.    Get her health tested. Have her CERF and OFA certified.    If she is not healthy or has an aggressive temperament, please don't breed her.    Have homes lined up for the pups or keep them yourself. Don't abandon them or throw them in a shelter. Irresponsible breeding gives every owner of an intact dog a bad name.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	This is SO not the place to be asking - how can you be sure people actually have a clue what they're talking about? On here, trust me they mostly don't.    You should be having an experienced breeder mentor you through this. You should also have a good relationship with a vets so you can be guided through all necessary health concerns and so you know you've got someone on hand if there's a problem - and so you know how to spot a problem!    If you haven't got or are unwilling to get both of those things,  you should not be risking the health of a dog and puppies by breeding. That is the best advice you can be given over the internet.    Chalice|`|z3QsWmzpaa	if you dont know what you are doing dont breed her but you really want to breed her then go to a professinal who knows what they are doing|`|ti8L5zryaa	I agree, DO NOT breed your dog, but get her spayed.  I have a purebred Labrador Retriever that I adore, but he is not  a good enough  example of this breed, so he is neutered.  Only dogs that have been proven to be genetically sound, and excellent example of their breed should be bred, and only by people who know what they are doing.  There are millions of dogs put down in shelters each year for lack of enough homes, any many of them are purebreds.  If you are doing it to make money, then shame on you.   I would suggest that you go to shelters and watch dogs being euthanized.  Also look for an Akita rescue group and ask their advice.  I foster dogs and get really disgusted with people like you.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Well I suggest if you sell these puppies you spend some of the money on an writing and grammar class.|`|yEUo24Znaa	The best advice I can give to you would be this:  Take your dog to the vet.  Tell the vet you are planning to breed her and you would like a complte physical and some tests to determine her suitability and get her UTD on all vaccines. Have her and the stud dog screened for brucellosis.  Plan to spend about $1200.00 for this.  Do not accept a "wellness exam" as a physical.  Save some money, as having a litter is expensive.  Plan on 6 to 8 pups and have a minimum of $150.00 per pup in savings and another $1,500.00 in case she needs a c-section. Yes, it happens, usually to the unprepared.    I believe you are going to go ahead and breed your dog no matter what. Make sure those "loads of good people" are willing to put a deposit on a puppy, minimum of $50.00. That should be non refundable and will at least coveer one set of shots and worming plus vet check.  Please make sure your girl is in the best shape of her life, get her out and moving. A fit dog is less likely to have problems durring gestation and whelping. Feed her a quality diet, no Ol Roy!  In closing, if your vet advises you not to breed, PLEASE take their advice.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	The most important thing to do is to get your Akita eye tested, hip scored and elbow graded. No reputable breeder would ever breed without doing these tests. If you go ahead without doing so and some of her puppies subsequently suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia or glaucoma or cataracts, the new owners could sue you, not just for the price of the puppy but also for vet bills and compensation. The stud dog also needs to have these tests.  Akitas are a wonderful breed but they are not for everyone and finding the right homes with responsible owners is not easy - are you sure you can find permanent loving homes for all the puppies (she could have 8 or 10) and are also in a position to take those puppies back at any stage in their lives if the owners can't keep them?  Only the very best Akitas with 100% temperaments, good hips, elbows, eyes and with parents with no history of thyroid problems or VKH should ever be bred from  If your ***** came from a reputable breeder they will be only to happy to advise you. If she didn't, chances are she's not good enough to be bred from.|`|AA10355591	Hello,  Did the person you bought the Akita from stipulate you should not breed from her?  If no you can't, then you cannot register your pups with the Kennel Club and it will make it more difficult to sell pups unregistered.      Why not talk to the breeder you bought her from and get some sound advice from them and perhaps your girl can be mated with a good quality sire that is a recognised champ.      What you don't want is to be stuck with pups that you just can't home.  Please bear in mind, due to the recession Dogs Trust this time last year had 75 dogs that needed rehoming.  It now stands at 750 because people can't afford to keep them anymore.    Personally, I don't agree with what you are doing.  I think it unfair and irresponsible but if you are going to do it anyway then please do it properly.|`|csDhZDvraa	First get you girl HEALTH TESTED, get x-rays of her hips and have other Akita breeders help evaluate them for you. Get her eyes and ears tested with the papers to back them up. Once she is has the greenlight of all health tests(no, vet check ups do not count as health testing LOL) then you are one step closer to breeding.    Next get her titled in conformation, agility, rally, obedience, or something else. Make sure she is a champion.    Now find a stud who compliments your female, he sould be just as good or better then her.    He and your girl should have a rock solid temperments and both should be health tested and very healthy.    While pregnant feed your female only the best of foods. Grainfree diets (no corn, soy, or wheat added) like Taste of the Wild, Evo, Wellness, ect. are WAY better for her then grain pumped foods like Science diet and eukanuba.    Find homes for all the potential puppies BEFORE you even breed.    If your female is not health tested, has an agressive temperment, and is not titled in any venue then get her SPAYED IMMEDIATLY! You should never breed a dog who is of unstable temperment, not health tested, and not titled in any venue. If you do you are joing the ranks of some of the most unsavory dog breeders(AKA PUPPYMILLERS AND BACKYARD BREEDERS) who stand for nothing but a quick buck and the pain of their breeding dogs.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	DONT BREED HER  there are to many animals that need homes and not enough homes for them!

In case you forgot, those answers were:   "DON"T BREED"|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Oh, my!  If you have to ask on Yahoo Answers, then you really shouldn't be doing this.    Breeding dogs should be left to those who have spent years researching pedigrees, know the breed in and out and only breed to improve the quality of future generations.    Akitas are not a dog for everyone.  What are you going to do if and when you can't find homes for the puppies?  A responsible breeder takes "cradle to the grave" responsibility for the dogs he/she produces, i.e., if anything happens, the breeder will take them back.  Are you prepared to do this?      Here's another thought -- if you care about your dog.  What if, heaven forbid, she ran into complications and died?  How would you feel?   It happens more frequently than you might think.      Have you had all the genetic tests done (hip displasia, eyes, etc.)?  I doubt it, since you seem to know absolutely nothing about breeding dogs.  Are you going to be producing dogs with bad hips or other genetic problems that the new owner is going to have to deal with?      Unless your dog is a breed champion or has otherwise proven herself in the show or performance ring, has had all her health clearances done, and has some attribute that is so outstanding that it should be passed down to future generations, she should *not* be bred.  Only superior specimens of the breed should reproduce.      If you think you are going to make money with this breeding, maybe.  You are going to have some vet expenses, even if you don't do the necessary testing.  And again, what if there are complications and she needs a C-section?  That is going to be pricey.  A truly responsible breeder is not in it to make money; in fact, they don't make money, what with all the expenses they have.  They are in it to better the breed.  Period.|`|qEOJzbJraa	If you gotta ask, you ain't got any business breeding.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is far too big a subject to give you the complete information you obviously need, on Y.Answers.

Sorry, you really do need to go into this far more deeply before you get into breeding.    ps  Do you realise that if you put your ****** in whelp, you are putting her life at risk - particularly if you don't know what you are doing!  Think about it.    And I've just seen your earlier question ..... read and learn.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Why do you want to breed? Are there no akitas in rescue where you are? Are there no REPUTABLE breeders? I don't care if my best friend is breeding their dog, if they don't do it the right way, I wouldn't touch the puppies with a 10ft pole. PLEASE do not breed your *****. I can gaurantee you that she is NOT of good quality simply because she was sold to a non-show home without a spay contract. Any reputable breeder sells puppies either to serious show homes or pet homes and ALL pet homed dogs go with spay/neuter contracts, without exception.     You have absolutely no idea what you are in for. Are you ready to pay for any problems that might arise in the whelp? What if your ***** dies or does not produce milk? Are you going to bottle feed the puppies every couple hours and stimulate them to pee/poop? What if one of your homes backs out? Can you care for the puppy forever or at least until you find an excellent home for it? What if more than one does? Can you care for multiple puppies or adult dogs?     Has you ***** had her hips and elbows OFA tested? What about her parents and grand parents? What about the male and his ancestors? Do they have good hips and elbows? If you don't know, please don't breed. Even if your girl checks out, you have no way of knowing if that is normal for her family or a fluke so there is no way to know if the puppies will have problems. How would you feel if your friends and family took one of your puppies only to have it suffer debilitating pain in a couple years? Or how would you feel if they suffered from autoimmune diseases, degenerative eye diseases or any of the other genetic conditions that akitas (and other breeds) carry? THIS is why it is important to study the pedigrees of both dogs involved in a breeding. If any of the brothers, sisters, sires, grand sires, dams, or grand dams of your dog or your "mate's" dog have had any of these problems, neither should be bred! EVER!     Please read at least some of the info on these sites:  http://www.akitaclub.org/health/health/m...  http://www.akitaclub.org/  http://www.akc.org/future_dog_owner/pupp...  http://www.akc.org/breeders/resources/gu...    There certainly is something wrong with just breeding for the sake of breeding. Do you know any owners who have seen their dogs go blind and suffer terrible pain from an autoimmune disease? I do. Do you know anyone who has had to scrimp and save and sacrifice in order to have expensive surgery to allow their akita to walk without extreme pain? I do. Do you know anyone who has had to struggle with watching their akita suffer through a painful genetic skin condition that is, at best, difficult to control? I do. Have you seen an akita suffer through heavy doses of dangerous meds in order to get an autoimmune disease under control? I have. Have you met rescuers who have to put akitas down because of behavioral problems caused by ignorant (and sometimes well meaning) owners? I have. If you think thse things can't/won't happen to you/your pups, think again. The first two examples were from well-bred akitas. Even people with years of experience can't prevent all conditions, so I shudder to think what kind of puppies you will produce.|`|ofUe4hBkaa	get it spayed!!  you obviously dont no what you are doing so i wouldnt go ahead with it.  sorry|`|VTee51r9aa	I never understand why people feel the need to breed dogs when there are so many in shelters waiting to be adopted! There are many dogs that are euthanized each day because these shelters are over crowded. I know people love puppies and their so cute but eventually they grow up to be dogs and then their not so cute anymore. Please remember don't shop, adopt!|`|AA12083992	I can not for the life of me understand why any one that likes dogs enough to have one would intentionally breed their pet. There are millions of healthy pups/dogs killed every year in shelters because their are never enough homes to go around. For every pup that is born, another dog dies in a shelter. Do you know there are fifteen dogs born for every one human? That means for every dog to have a home every human would have to own fifteen dogs. A family of four would have to own sixty dogs. Not likely to happen. Why would you want to contribute to the gross pet overpopulation problem? Even if you find homes for all your pups, what about when those pups start having pups? Did you know that one female and her offspring can produce 67,000 dogs in either six or seven years? Are you prepared to find 67,000 homes in that amount of time? Please, for the sake of homeless dogs everywhere, reconsider breeding her. Encourage people to adopt pups that are already born, save a life. Those pups are dying for a home.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Didn't you just ask this question?    Do NOT breed your b*tch. Is she health tested? Is she certified? Has she been shown so you know she is going to better the breed standard?     Are you prepared to help the mother feed 6-12 puppies every 2 hours if she rejects them? Are you prepared to be cleaning up a endless supply of poop and pee to keep the whelping box clean? Are you prepared to give them shots and de-worm them? Are you prepared to spend countless hours socializing them? Are you prepared to spend most nights sleeping by your b*tches side just in case she needs you when she goes into labor? Are you prepared for your b*tch dying and you having to be the sole provider for the pups? What if all the pups die, will you just breed the b*tch again?    Please don't bring any more dogs into this world. Akita's get a bad rep sometimes for being aggressive (as do most dogs). Do you already have 6-12 homes lined up for the unborn pups? Are you prepared to take as many of half of these dogs back in 0-10+ years when they are no longer wanted or are poorly bred?    If you care about the health of your dog, go get her spayed.     If you honestly believe she has something to BETTER the breed standard with, get a breed mentor and do this the RIGHT way.     You so called wannabe breeders make me sick.     Do it RIGHT, or don't do it at ALL.     Congratulations for contributing to the average of every 9 seconds an animal is killed in a shelter.    EDIT: Just because your "mate" has an intact male with PAPERS doesn't mean squat. Most of the time, papers are a joke.    Did you know, the just because your dog is registered doesn't mean they are PB? Many GREEDY people have a PB registered dog, it goes into heat, gets preggo by a MUTT, and they register the pups anyways.    So the fact that your mate has papers on his dog doesn't mean a single thing. Is he shown? Does he have any CH titles? Do they even know basic commands? DO tell.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Seems like you shouldn't breed until you absolutely know what you're doing.  You should go to dog shows and talk to an expert.  There is much more to breeding a dog than getting her pregnant and selling puppies.  True breeders want to improve the breed and make it as close to possible to the breed standard.  You must also understand canine genetics.  They do not work the same as human genetics.  For example:  Are you familiar with line breeding? or out-crossing?.  I don't think you should breed just to sell the pups for money, or you'll contribute to ruining the breed.  Just look at the German Shepherd Dogs in America and the ones in Germany, the American bred German Shepherds are such curs that our Police force and the Armed forces have to get the working dogs from Germany or the Czech Republic.
JGq9rKBOaa	DO NOT GET A PET FOR A 2 YEAR OLD.*              *An exception to this rule would be if YOU wanted a hamster. YOU will be taking care of the hamster 100%. You will be handling the hamster - a  2 year old is too young to handle a small animal. You will be feeding it every day, cleaning the cage weekly, and possibly paying vet bills. For the next 2 to 3 years.     Hamsters make great pets when they are not dropped, squeezed, or yelled at. 2 year olds drop, squeeze, and yell.     If you want a hamster for yourself that your 2 year old can look at, great. Try small privately owned pet stores or breeders, as well as animal shelters, before you resort to Petco or Petsmart.     But if you're considering a hamster because your 2 year old wants one, please reconsider. If your 2 year old doesn't want one  and you're trying to teach responsibility or something, don't bother.      Sorry if I sounded harsh and exasperated - I just have worked with several small animal rescue groups and a nature center, and the number 1 reason that people give up these critters is "the kids got sick of it." It's better not to get an animal in the first place than it is to get one and abandon it.    And trust me - 2 year olds don't really appreciate pets. I used to teach nature classes for kids preschool through elementary school aged, and until the kids hit about 2nd grade, they were significantly more interested in the stuffed animals and "habitat playgrounds" in the center than they were in the animals themselves. Going way back, when I was two, my parents had a dog that I wasn't allowed to touch. However, I did have a stuffed beagle that was a great companion.|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	I would definately not get a two year old a hamster. They break too easily! A great alternative would be a rat. They are great pets. Kind of like a small puppy. They are also more flexible. An added benifit is that rats don't normally bite people like a hamster would. Hate for baby to get hurt too. If you decide to try a rat, it would be best to get a small one. It would be easier to train. You can also litter train a rat very easily. And just think, you would be saving it from a dire fate! (snake's mouth)|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Syrians are the bigger hamsters and are nicer then dwarfs and robos. Get the hamster from Petsmart, not from Petco there animals are always sick. A 2 year old might hurt a hamster, why don't you get a rabbit instead.|`|wAzNCS48aa	I have 2 hamsters both from petsmart and both very healthy.|`|GenpGk7Daa	Pet smart. But I recommend a rat instead. Rats are hardier, sweeter, more intelligent, live longer, and come in multiple variations.|`|z1QBNLACaa	Never get a two year old a pet!  Do YOU want a hamster?  It will be yours and you can let the child pet it while YOU hold the hamster.  It's not safe for the animal nor the child to get such a young person an animal of any kind.    Many hamsters need a lot of handling and socialization or they become likely to bite.  They will want to sleep while the child is loud during the day, and they will be cranky when you wake them up.   That's not fair to the hamster or the child.  The child wants to hold and cuddle something, so a stuffed animal is a better option.    You can try http://www.petfinder.com for a hamster rescue, who will also be able to help you pick the right breed/personality for your situation and direct you to good food/cage/bedding choices.    Here are some links to hamster information: http://www.rabbitadoption.org/hamstercar...|`|syFLorK2aa	I think a 2 year old might be too young for a pet. Although they are well intentioned, they do not have developed enough control of their hands and may squeeze too hard while holding the hamster. Also, being nocturnal the hamster might not be awake when your child is at all.     But, if you are prepared for the responsibility and your child is really excited about it - I would recommend going to a smaller independent pet shop. A fairly high proportion of Syrians bought from large chain stores die of a disease called wet tail shortly after being brought home (of course it is not the majority - but there is quite a fair chance of it happening and it's not worth the risk when it might break a 2 year old's heart). The reason is that large chain pet stores buy their stock from mass breeders where they are bred in small cages and transported across the country, into the pet shop backroom, then onto the sales floor, then to your new home. These animals are sensitive to environment changes and this kind of constant moving around puts a huge amount of stress on them that can literally kill them by causing the disease wet tail to develop.    So I recommend going to a smaller pet shop where they are more likely to have a local supplier or even breed the hamsters themselves. There is still a risk they might catch the disease, but it's lower. Choose a hamster with bright eyes and clean fur who doesn't look too small [some pet shops in the US sell them too young and this increases the risk]. The tanks in the pet shop should be clean and not too overcrowded. The best way to find out how tame they are is to ask to hold them, most hamsters will be a bit nervous the first time you pick them up, but if they settle down while you are holding them or don't seem to mind the handling - they are probably a friendly little thing.   The temperament of pet shop hamsters varies hugely and is basically random. So the only way to tell is to hold them.     Good luck.|`|zGid9wJBaa	I think you should get a rescue hamter because every time people go to PetSmart or Petco for pets they could be saveing an animals life when they rescue a pet.  Cause in shelters sometimes after two weeks they put them down!    I have 19 rescue kittens that were fostering  2 RESCUE Guinea Pigs  2 rescue cats  2 rescue collie dogs
ArBOK95aaa	has the kitten seen a vet for a full check up and deworming?  some internal parasites can cause an extremely foul odor.    you are also feeding a very low quality diet.  SD is chocked full of fillers and carbohydrates - things your cat has absolutely no nutritional need for.  What the body does not need will be eliminated, so you will have bigger bulkier stools on low quality food than you will on high quality food.  Change their diet to a high protein, high moisture content, low carb diet, and you should see a great improvement in the out put in the litter box and in your cat's over all health and well being.    Check out http://www.catinfo.org a website run by a vet who actually studies feline nutrition on all the reasons behind feeding a better quality diet.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	you need to feed them better food, science diet is expencive CRAP (quite litterly)   put them on wellness.  hopefully you have an appointment for the 4 month old here soon to get him neutered.    if you are still concerend a call to the vet would be inorder.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Kittens waste is usually stronger smelling to start.  But food, worms and not being neutered/spayed can also affect the smell.    Get him neutered now if he's not done.  And have him wormed too.  I would also recommend another kitten food (Science Diet is NOT a good one).  Try Wellness, Natural Balance, Max Cat or Royal Canin (dry and canned).|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	Your cat is dehydrated. This causes concentration of the eliminated product.     Because this odor isn't normal, I'd take him to the vet. But discuss diet with the vet, and switch to a combination of dry and wet food, with lots of fresh water. Canned tuna, though expensive, would be a nice variation in his diet, at least temporarily. You can also feed him meat scraps, cut very small.|`|FOLjr8G9aa	hmmmm, maybe it's the litter that is making it smell. my favourite litter is "yesterday's news" my cat loves it, it smells a little but not that much. or there is this one I can't remember it's name but it is like wheat or something. it may be the food, but if you have 2 other cats and they don't smell I don't know. I only feed my cat iams digestive. it helps him get rid of his constipaiton, which your cat may have. try feeding him half a can of wet food in the morning, the liquid helps my cat poop. try fancy feast, meow mix, and that is about the only good wet food with gravy. good luck, and congrats on your new kitty!  Piper|`|zeTGmB3faa	At that young age, neither should be that strong. He should have a vet check to see why the urine is so concentrated and the food changed to lighten the feces odor. It is time to get him neutered as he will start spraying shortly if it is not done. Try a canned cat food and the dry.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Gradually switch your cats over from a dry diet to a wet one, or at least half and half.  Too much dry food can cause all sorts of digestive problems because it is stuffed with things that cats should not eat (even Science Diet contains grains and fillers which cats should not have).  You should be looking for a high protein/lo carb wet food and you can find examples of this via the internet (I am in the UK so can't advise you on the best makes if you are in the USA).    Edit - You can get Orijen in the USA which is a very good dry food as it contains no garbage at all and is suitable for both cats and kittens - I have it sent to me in the UK.  However, I would still advocate a diet higher in wet food.  I also have Bozita shipped to me so you could research that via the internet.|`|1bRRODd2aa	He's growing up and becoming an adult male cat.    All cat's pee and poop stink, the males are worse than females.  Keep the litter clean, clear out the box daily and this should keep the stink to a minimum.    Have him neutered ASAP, and this should minimise the stink, plus he won't start spraying all over your flat.    As for diet, either use a very high quality dry food (Science Diet doesn't fall into this category), or mix half and half wet and dry food.
wbZp6ZcPaa	Perhaps some kind of thermos that's insulated that drips the water into the bowl (like those automatic feeders)? Poor kitties. I'm sure you don't want them in your sinks but you could leave a faucet dripping into a bowl for them as well. It'll keep the water moving so it doesn't freeze and help keep your pipes from bursting. good luck!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	you could try putting a tennis ball or something along those lines in it that will float and bounce around and keep the water agitated.    alternately, if you bring canned food with you to feed them, they'll get all the moisture they need from the food and it won't be a big deal if they don't have access to water.|`|lys5kB9Daa	fill the bath tub, i would think since theres so much water in there it would be harder for it all to freeze like a little bowl.   also, i dont know if your pipes are frozen or the water in your toilet is frozen, but if a cat is really going to die of thirst, they will figure out to drink from the toilet. i know it sounds gross but what can ya do lol  since you keep going over there, bring them water with their food.  hope you guys get your power soon!!|`|RXSu3VNdaa	Let the sink drip water. fill two bowls. one with hot water, it will take longer to freeze and last longer. They wont get hurt. Keep them marm too!!|`|ArBOK95aaa	you should try contacting your local humane society and see if they are doing pet rescue.    Up here in Maine, we lost our power for over a week, and our shelter set up a room for ice storm rescues.  They were put in a cage, but at least they were warm and well cared for.    or try a boarding facility.. they might have generators to keep heat going for the pets.    Cats might have fur coats, and go outside in cold weather, but they are very susceptible to the cold.  Please reconsider leaving them unattended.  I doubt you could forgive yourself if on the off chance something happened..|`|EEgZsmRxaa	Keep the water on the main floor and away from doors and windows. This should reduce the chances of the water bowl freezing. Also, if you have a heating pad for sore muscles that is battery powered, you can keep it under the bowl underneath a towel (Don't want a short circuit).|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	oh my god!  if it is that cold that their water is freezing, it is way too cold for them to be in there.....those poor kitties.  I would NEVER EVER EVER EVER would have thought for one second to leave my cats in a house with no electricity.
Jkt3UkTBaa	Have you cycled the tank? ( If this is a NO than this is a sure reason as to why your fish has died. )  Do you have filtration, bubblers and a heater? ( If this is a NO than there is a high chance they died due to lack of oxygen and fresh water. )  Are the ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and ph levels at a sensible level? ( If this is a NO than that is a sure reason as to why the fish died .)  Have you dechlorinated the water before adding the water to the tank? ( If this is a no this is another reason why the fish could've died. )  Did you see any abnormal behaviour with your fish before the incident? ( If this is a YES than that could've meant your fish had ich or dropsy and so on. )  is the water tempature at 70-80 F?  ( If this is a NO then this is another big reason. )  Was there any aggresion  ( If there was aggresion then that can lead to fin rot, stress, suicide and dead fish )  All of those reasons could lead to death and sickness.  Anyway good luck!|`|wnnudNp5aa	Since you've suffered two deaths at once, something is probably wrong in your tank. It most likely can affect your other fish, so you need to act quickly. Test your water. You should have a test kit. If you don't, take some of the water to your nearest pet store, they will usually test it for free. If your filter and heater are working properly, it almost has to be a water issue. Your pet store can tell you what you need to adjust to save the rest of your fish. Good luck!
ArBOK95aaa	there are certain breeds of cat that are known to be very vocal.  Siamese are one of them.  Is your kitten long and slender?  then he probaly has some Siamese in him somewhere (or is actually Siamese, cause you can get pure bred kitties at a shelter)       if he is eating and active and friendly, then you just have a talker.. nothing wrong with that unless it bugs you.  You can try to ignore it, the less you respond the less likely he will be to talk to you. Praise and treat when he's quiet, he might get the hint, but like some kids who can't stop talking, neither can some kitties..|`|Amkmles0aa	my kittys are the some way some cats are just that way|`|zeTGmB3faa	You have a talker. Talk back. He likes the attention and needs a lot of it. He is probably very needy and will always need a little extra of your time. Enjoy him.|`|60mDEusiaa	That's odd. Maybe he's just very talkative.|`|BS6tLSGJaa	as you said he's 7 or 8 months old..then maybe he misses his last owner.  you can talk to his last owner and ask if he meowed this much with him too or not...then you'll know if he's naturally talkative.|`|RXSu3VNdaa	He is just talkative. Mine meows alot too.
ti8L5zryaa	It is not training that is required in this problem, it is establishing that YOU are the leader of all the dogs, and that they do not have to try to vie  to   be the leader.  I would agree with the first person to answer that it would be valuable to watch The Dog Whisperer for ideas and check out his website.  Also, Virginia Stillwell in It's Me or the Dog on Animal Planet, and I am sure she has a web site.  Look for Karen Pryor's website also.  There could be answers from local obedience school staff, so check that out.They all should get LOTS of daily exercise.    This could help drain some energy, and calm them down.    Are they all spayed or neutered?   Unless you show these dogs and they are excellent examples of their breed/breeds, they should be.  Whatever method you use, they should be kept separated.  You still might have to re-home one of the trouble-makers.  Good Luck!|`|AA12128656	you need to control the dogs, and correct them when they act inappropriately. i have 6 pit bull terriers and pit mixes who all get along because I AM THE BOSS and i said they have to.    don't allow your dogs to do this undesirable behavior. period.    when you are not around, separate them to different rooms, or crate them.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Contact your local kennel club.  They can refer you to a reputable trainer in your area.      I guess I just don't get why people's dogs fight.  We have four males.  There was one confrontation, that I quickly put an end to.  You have to be the alpha dog.  You are the one who is allowing this bad behavior.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Your dogs need you to be a leader.  Dogs, like wolves, are pack animals who need a leader in order to set rules, boundaries & limitations for them.  You haven't done that for them.  I would suggest watching the National Geographic channel & The Dog Whisperer - Cesar Millan.  If you don't get the channel, go to his website.  Get his books or DVDs and learn.|`|AA10041941	you probably should have been a little smarter when it came to how many animals you would have and then getting then spayed or neutered..your doing them all a great injustice keeping them seperately and you can't even enjoy having them because your so worried.. it wasn't smart!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That is most certainly a training issue, and while I think the advice to use the Dog Whisperers methods to gain control of your pack is good, I don't think that you'll be able to learn what you need to learn watching his tv shows or DVDs.      What you should do is call around and find an experienced K9 behaviorists that uses these methods to come evaluate your dogs and set up a training program.|`|1KHXv5hkaa	It seems you are very inexperienced with pet handling.     If you understood what you were doing, and the challenges you are attempting to tackle, you would know that the right thing to do would be to only have one dog.     You obviously have way too much going on. I'm confident those dogs would be much happier if they were but in separate homes. They would be receiving love from a family that is willing to work with them.     Please consider yourself, and do the right thing here.|`|wscyjkPAaa	They fight because of the power struggle you caused when you brought the 3rd dog.  Sadly your two dogs do not see you as their leader.  You need to be the one on top and all the other dogs need to be subordinate to you.  You need to walk your dogs everyday for at least an hour to drain their energy and to stimulate their brain.|`|MdSiSwtkaa	some dogs are temperamental and get jealous easy.my dogs were the same way.  try getting a toy they will play with like a tug a war toy it helped my dogs.
f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	You will have people say grain, corn, oats, flaxseed etc..  But really, the best thing to try first, is to get a high quality hay and give out as much as she is willing eat.    Also make sure she don't have worms.  At four she most likely don't have problems with her teeth but check them anyways.    If this is a skinny horse and it is cold(near freezing or below), you could, blanket her at night, this will reduce the amount of energy that the body uses to keep warm.|`|aSenTXv6aa	My horse was EXTREMLY underweight when i got him... so i gave him equine senior ( its not for senior horses) and ricebran... he got nice and full bodied in 3 weeks, hope i gave you best answer material|`|ieeq5jx8aa	soz dunno neva have had a horse|`|PUspAGxFaa	keep her on bermuda grass hay. try feeding her alflafa pellets and rice bran. if she needs weight in her topline add top-line to the rice bran and alfalfa pellets Good Luck!
iXijnCxOaa	This is the hazard of breeding a larger dog to a smaller b*tch.      You should have done an x-ray on day 57 of the pregnancy which would have told you not only the size of the pup(s) but the number and you could have scheduled a c-section at that time.    Now - you need to bring her in to the vet for a shot of oxytocin to be sure she's expelled whatever remains in her uterus.  This is ESPECIALLY important as she will not have pups to nurse causing a natural release of hormones to cause her uterus to contract back to size.  The vet will also check to make sure there are no other pups remaining.    Its sad that you, through inexperience and lack of knowledge, have put your b*tch through all this without even a live puppy as a result.    Please, for the sake of your b*tch, take her in to the vet today.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	you should wait a little longer maybe she"ll have more puppies but if not i think you should go to the vets asap!!  My friends dog had only one puppy because the dog named lippy was to  little to have such a large dog in-preganat her she was a poodle and the other dog was a shepherd so i dont know if that can be the reason...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes sometimes. You can't predict how many pups they will have & it sounds like the sire was too large to be mating with her.  Hopefully you will spay her when she recovers.  You could have easily lost her also by having too large of a pup.|`|AA11193920	First, the name of the breed is Shih Tzu.    Second, why the heck would you want to breed her to a mutt?    Third, some females are not meant to be bred at all, and if she lost her one and only pup (and are you sure that the one was the only?) then, I would hav her fixed.    Fourth, no, it is not common for a Shih Tzu to have only one puppy, so I would get your butt off the computer and get her into the vet to make sure that there are no other puppies stuck (since obviously the first one was). If there is another stuck, your girl WILL die!|`|VaYjl71Laa	Why are you surprised?  Don't worry, you're a byb, why should you care if some creature dies?

If there is another stuck, your girl WILL die!|`|nYv65TlEaa	I am sorry for the lose,did you try and suck the mucus from the pups mouth and nose?    did you try and stimulate the puppy by rubbing it vigorously ?    did you try and remove the sack from the puppy when mom didn't do it,  a puppy who isn't breeding properly will have its mouth open,if mouth is closed and puppy is moving means all mucus cleared    I am so sorry for the lose of the puppy  but you need to know if there are more puppies,an x-RAY should be taken ,so you'll have to get to the vet    yes your breed can have only one puppy,is not uncommon, 3 to 6 is the norm,but not un heard of to have 1,that's why you needed to have your Girl x-ray at 55 days so you would of known there was only one and chances a c-section was to be done    if you decide to breed your girl again,i suggest with the same breed  your gal is gonna goes through a bad time,you'll have to make sure she doesn't get her teats infected with milk coming in..    Your Vet will tell you how much to reduce water intake and food intake to dry up her teats,if she gets mastitis,you have even more problem    please get her to the Vets,they will give her a clean out shot,unless you feel and the Vet feels puppy movement    you really needed to do research when you knew your girl was mated..    so Sad.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You are lucky she didnt die in the process. This is hy you research these things BEFORE you breed your animal. If it was an accident then you research while it is pregnant. The father might of been too bog and the pup died in the birth canal. Please get your dog fixed. Next time she will likely die.
FnrAw2SQaa	YOU can make her a birthday cake!  she"ll eat that and be happy you made it!!|`|AA12128656	how about a stick?    dogs don't have birthdays, silly!!|`|72GOhb9eaa	You could take her on a walk in the park or something like that if there is nothing to give her.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Your neighbors dog doesn't even know that it has a birthday.  If you feel a need to spend money, why don't you donate the amount that you would spend to a charitable organization, dog related or not.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Get her some treats, or make her some.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Is this what we've come to?  Birthday parties for neighbor dogs?      Sorry, but I don't get it.  I don't get my own dogs presents for their birthdays.    Sounds like she doesn't need anything anyway.  I like the idea of a donation to the shelter in her name, though!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Don't waste your money.  Why would you want to buy your neighbor's dog a birthday present?|`|z3QsWmzpaa	no offensive but there is nothing left to get her|`|IFiwmb3Haa	Get a gift certificate to PetSmart or your local pet store.  Make your own doggie treats (www.pooppantry.com).  Buy some gourmet snacks. =)|`|wAzNCS48aa	If you give her parents a gift card then they can spend it on food and the things that she needs to stay healthy and happy. I would suggest finding out what store that shop at for her first.    Good Luck.     and Happy Birthday to her !|`|NLCKu3Nraa	Your question can't be for real but I'll answer it anyway just in case it is. How about you take that money and instead of buying a dog (who wouldn't know the difference whether it received anything or not) something pointless, sponsor a starving child from Africa so that he/she can have something to eat!|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Dogs do recognize special days -- like Christmas and their Birthday and they LOVE the attention and the gifts!!!    At 6 I'm sure she has a lot of toys and such, so unless you find a special, unusual toy (like one that plays Happy Birthday or one that records a special message) I can understand your reluctance.    How about  paying the fee for a year at your local dog park?    Or how about a first or last appointment of the day Photo Shoot for a beautiful portrait of their dog?    Or a tribute in her name at the local shelter to pay for a homeless pet's upkeep?|`|lgBD4BS0aa	What about collars?
QxIhMHwAaa	Absolutely not. I have a green cheek conure and a budgie. While I supervise playtime (usually one is in a cage and the other is out), or I take them out and hold them at the same time, I would certainly NOT house them together. A conure's beak can do too much damage to a small budgie in a short amount of time. My budgie is actually the one that lashes out more at my conure though. But I still wouldn't take a chance.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Technically you can put a budgie in with a conure....But do not expect them to live peacefully. I would not advise it.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Budgies and cockatiels generally do well together, but I had terrible luck trying to combine them together with a lovebird.  I called it "racial tensions".  I had to wonder if parrots from different geographical areas (Australia vs. Africa in my case, Australia vs. South America in yours) somehow knew they were too different so they didn't get along.  Try it for just a couple of minutes and supervise very carefully, then gradually increase the duration until you're comfortable that they're sharing space and not pecking at each other.|`|uqU5W7vaaa	Its best not to mix different kinds of bird in the same cage. They tend not to get a long as well. But once they are familiar with each other outside the cage, there shouldn't be much of a problem with it.|`|8QatPQfRaa	Not inside a cage. Parrots are territorial, especially females - it's a "nest" for them.  The same play area should be fine.
