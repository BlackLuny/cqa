3Ifvj2sgaa	The current yield is the coupon payment divided by the price that you paid for the bond.     So, the coupon payment (C) is $90 (Face Value (FV) * Coupon rate). However, the face value is NOT necessarily the price you paid for the bond.     Assuming you just bought this bond now, the present value (PV) of the bond is the price.     To find the     PV = C/((1+.08))^1 + C/((1+.08))^2 + ..... +C/((1+.08))^7 + FV/((1+.08))^7    The first term's denominator is to the power of 1 because 1 year has passed before you receive that payment and interest is paid annually. The last two terms are the to the power of 7 because seven years have passed when you receive the final coupon payment. Also, you must add in the FV/(1.08)^7 because after 7 years you receive the face value of the bond as well. The .08 is the YTM.    No, to get current yield, C/PV   or the price you paid for the bond if you bought the bond right now.

Input = 800 + 41100 = 41900  Output = 40700 + 1200 = 41900    EU = 40700 + 1200 x 65% = 41480    The cost of Beg WIP is 15250 for DM and 2000 for conversion  The cost for the period = 904200 for DM & 182340 for conversion    EU cost/ unit for DM = 919450/ 41480 = 22.1661  EU cost/ unit for Conv = 184340/ 41480 = 4.4441    The lat question indicate that it';s FIFO, please confirm.

wADsOOILaa	After you use the capital loss to offset any capital gains, you can use just $3000 to offset other income.  The balance becomes a capital loss carryforward to next year and beyond until it is consumed in full.    Take the $3000 and multiply it by your tax rate to get this year's savings.  For instance, $3000 x 25% = $750.
0fb9cfa7afed23044f4b019f2438ba2baa	I have to agree with Managment Mom here. And be aware that you should never bad talk your past positions or managers it will reflect badly on you. Like she said you can word it in a positive way by saying why you would work better in a different environment. Good luck with your search.|`|NVIDmJpKaa	Dear Rockit:     Is this a position that looked good while you were interviewing, but turned out to be different once you got the job? What were the things that drew you to accept their offer? Have these changed? While we can't always like the people we work with, do they have team qualities that make the organization successful?  There are always people in the work place who are not pleasant to deal with.      Telling an interviewer that your current position "isn't working out" for you, is too vague an explanation. It makes it look like you didn't use good judgment in taking the job in the first place.      Saying that you like the work but not the people is an honest and direct approach. Be prepared to provide tactful examples of why working somewhere else would be better for you AND the company you're leaving.  Things like: "I prefer to work with dependable team members", or "I'd like to work with a group that is more focused on the company's success", are good reasons. These also show a positive attitude in improving your own situation, while not downgrading the current employer.   Good luck in your search.|`|PaKwqlrWaa	What about saying that you feel " It is just not a good fit". Isn't that what is being said, when a person gets fired?    You don't get into saying you don't like the office politics and your co-workers because I am not sure how that can affect a possible reference check call. You don't point the finger at them, instead you have decided this is not what YOU were looking for but you appreciated the opportunity to work there ....|`|UnzEIbxgaa	Don't tell them anything.

AA11542500	A staffing agency works on your behalf to set up interviews with companies looking to hire someone like you.  They always get a finder's fee for placing you and if you are a temporary, they get a cut.  Sometimes it's easier to go through an agency because they do the searching and setting up of interviews for you; however, since the agency gets a cut whether permanent or temporary, you might not be able to negotiate a salary as much as if you had gone directly to the company.
HUlYUWpoaa	When you register the name of your business with the state and when you apply for an EIN they ask for the name of the owner/principle plus the business name.      So if the business is registered as Susie Smith dba Susie's Cookie Shop then obviously it is a business owned by a female.
ak3NBmINaa	I bet it is at least $400/day, and probably more, depending on size and location and condition.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	In San Diego anyway, it usually costs about what a place would rent for by the month to get it for a week. So, a place that would rent out for about $2000 a month would cost about that much per week. Of course, this is because they are move-in ready, furnished, with dishes and everything. And, they have to be thoroughly cleaned after each tenant moves out.    You can get an idea of how much beach houses rent out for on craigslist. But, I would recommend you go through a management company when you actually rent a place. There are lots of people out there renting places out that have been foreclosed and are vacant. But, it's just a scam and they take your money without having any place for you to rent.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	It can be quite expensive and people who own these homes would probably never consider renting to spring breakers.  We rented a home on Cape Cod for a small family reunion that had 4 bedrooms for $2000 a week and that was a lowball figure for the area and we weren't on the beach.  I would expect Florida to be much more expensive particularly beachside.  We looked at renting a beach side home on Nags Head in N.C. and that was $4000.  No one renting these spaces would want to even think about entertaining spring breakers who usually are destructive to the property.|`|DJDlGjbLaa	It depends on when you are going. You are probably going to be looking at a high price, but you can research it online by typing in beach homes in Florida.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	Daily rentals in Florida during spring break is like renting a hotel room in Las Vegas during a convention or even the Super Bowl.

9EpxH38paa	It doesn't matter since you will owe 15.3 % self employment tax on it as well as income tax at whatever incremental rate bracket it puts you in when added to your W-2 income. You could follow the example of the new Secretary of The Treasury and just not report it; then,  apologize when you get caught.  I don't recommend it though, because one thing the IRS does with astounding accuracy is to match your return with the Form 1099's and W-2's filed by those who paid anything to you during the year.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The 1099-MISC income should be entered as business or self-employment income, not as wages.  This is done for technical reasons, relating to that they did not withhold taxes from the commissions, only from the salary.    The software is working properly.  Income from work that is reported on Form 1099-MISC is subject to self-employment tax, in addition to regular income tax.  That is why you owe.

97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I know exactly what you mean.  I spent my junior and senior years in high school and my first semester in college job searching.  Some of the questions on some of these online applications are ridicules.  I guarantee you that the manager don't even look at the questions and answers, in fact they probably don't look at the applications.  They probably look at any one random application, look at the phone number and call that person in for an interview.  That job applicant could be a murderer that escaped jail, and they won't care.  They supermarkets do this all the time.    Especially the supermarkets don't care how they present their store to costumers.  They don't care who they hire, they just hire people who need or want a job.  Whenever they get a job applicant who wants to learn the job, they act all stupid and reject him/her.  Just hang in there and the something will work-out.|`|ryaLQkfRaa	Actually, they can, and do look at the answers. Apparently there's an algorithm built into the system that can tell whether or not you are lying based on your answers to the questions. I've also been told that it times your activity on each page.

2666e45ceda5b1f2cfab4e91f880efdcaa	All the sites people are suggesting to you are pretty much scams. There are some ways to make money online but they are normally VERY VERY low profit, such as click on links for 1 cent emails. Which normally require your account have 30 or more dollars to even cash out.    There is ebay where you can auction off things you don't want. That is one way to make money, but you have to know what you're doing.    Be careful|`|DorePwVOaa	Another "Get Paid To" site that works is CashDuck. Kira (the owner) pays by PayPal, check, or giftcard. I used to use it, but I don't anymore because I do part-time clerical work for Kira and the site, so it would be a conflict of interest. But it's also how I know the site is legit! My referral link is in the sources, or you can just go to http://www.cashduck.com.    You can also try survey sites, like SurveySavvy.com, SurveySpot.com, and MySurvey.com. I've had some pretty good luck with those three - a few dollars once a week or so, but it doesn't take much time, so it's worth it to me.    Honestly, the biggest money-maker online for me is my blog. I write about personal finance, and I sell ads and use affiliate links to bring in some cash. I make about $100 a month with that, but it's taken me 2 years of writing to get to that point - it's definitely hard work!|`|f4cklSnbaa	Are you 13 years or older and looking for a way to make some extra money?

Other types of scams are sites that have you act as a referrer to another site, and they claim they will only pay you, when that person signs up or something like so.    Don't fall for the easy quick scams, because in the end you'll end up paying for it.  I do work online and I stupidly enough paid a site to give me this info, afterwards I realize I could of searched it up had I known where to look.    I'll give you one site I use, and from there you can search out much much more via webbrowsing.  Most people have a digital camera of some sort.  To do this type of work you need a digital Camera of minimum 4 Megaxpixel in quality for auto focus cameras, and 6 Megapixels for focus free cameras.    The business is taking stock photographs.  No nothing like pornography, no pictures of sunsets, pets, or body parts either.  Stock photos refer to images and pictures used in everyday web pages.      You signup to a site to sell your photos, and they tell you what quality and types of pictures they will accept.  They host your photos if they are interested, and sell them for you.  Or they may buy your images directly.      To date I've sold 3 photos, and have 12 in commision sites, meaning I get a percentage or fee per downloaded image.  Its a good steady amount of cash so far.  Goto the site below and click on, "sell stock", from there they will tell you their requirements, or needs.      If you take photos of reconizable faces, you need a model release signed by each person.  Unless that person is a celebrity, and your source of getting that photo wasn't in any way invading their privacy.    p.s.  here's a hint, take unique photos, like traffic accidents, cultural events, kids birthday parties, local news, unique architectual qualities of local landmarks, etc...|`|z5YSV79Saa	All The answers are not legit or slow in getting money.

I found a great apartment in north Fargo- its really really inexpensive because it is close to the water treatment plant, up by Trollwood Park. Its a 2 bedroom, over 900 square feet, completely redone flooring/carpeting/paint and its only $450 a month! I live here with my boyfriend.     We have laundry on every floor, that we pay for. We have a garage, outdoor pool, balcony, free internet w/ our 12 mo lease- I love it. Heat and electricity are not paid. I think its pretty common for tenants to pay for their own, to be honest with you.
lmVDvmMCaa	The bee is used historically to represent business, although it can mean other things.  Engineers use gears, lawyers use scales, musicians use musical instruments.  So if you have a particular trade in mind, you  can consider a more specific charge.    On "sectors," many teachers want students to place symbols in quarters.  However, quarters are used most often to represent the different arms of married family members.

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	There are limited jobs out there for your age group because of Kentucky's child labor laws. http://www.labor.ky.gov/ows/employmentst...    Some employers are even backing off hiring until 17, 18 nowadays so they'll have more shift options for working their employees. That leaves a limited market open to you.    Try marketing yourself as a babysitter for your neighborhood. This is what I did. Either American Heart Association or Red Cross offers a first aid course for babysitters (can't remember which). Get certified, then advertise yourself in your neighborhood newsletter/web page or go door-to-door with flyers.    Yard work/mow lawns. This is what my brother did. Be professional and you could end up with enough repeat customers for several summers. You can also rake in the fall, help lay mulch in spring and fall, clean up in the fall and spring, &/or shovel snow in the winter. Advertise yourself in your neighborhood association's newsletter/web page or go door-to-door with flyers.     No fast food, okay. What about a grocery store?

Retail...may be harder to get because you are competing with adults and people with degrees.    If you aren't looking for money, but just want something to stay busy, you might want to contact local hospitals about serving as a teen volunteer. I know UK Hospital has them. They do things like deliver patient mail/flowers, run errands for staff, etc. Looks good on a college application. Also gets your foot in the door if you are thinking about a career in health care.    Watch for help wanted" signs as you are out and about. Look through the local papers' classifieds. You'll probably put in applications at more than one place. Dress nicely when called back and act professional. Keep in mind you are possibly competing with adults/professionals who have lost their jobs because of the economy.  Most places will hire the one they can work the hardest/longest (read: 18+) and the one with any kind of job experience.

8serxyLuaa	The book value is the value of the asset on the book less the accumulated depreciation.  The residual value that the company will estimate. This is what they expect the asset to be worth at the end of its useful life.  --------------------------------------...    Formal definitions    The book value of an asset is the amount of cost in its asset account less the accumulated depreciation applicable to the asset.   The book value of a company is the amount of owner's or stockholders' equity.    In depreciation the residual value is the estimated scrap or salvage value at the end of the asset's useful life. In the accounting equation, owner's equity is considered to be the residual of assets minus liabilities. In investment evaluations, the residual value is the profit minus the cost of capital.    http://www.accountingcoach.com/accountin...

dd17NBsUaa	Pretty much everything has been hit by the global slowdown.  Cash interest rates have fallen off a cliff, equity markets have fallen (UK by 30%) and even the safest fixed interest have seen 20% falls in value.     Gold has retained its value and done well over 6 months, however a lot of this has been to do with the dollar strengthening against sterling.  Gold is a traditional safe haven in troubled times, but it can fall in value as well as rise.     Going forward it is actually the markets that have faired amongst the worst that are probably the best going forward.  Corporate bonds have been hammered, so there are opportunities to benefit from a recovery in prices, so too UK blue chip equities.

IpSqsUzaaa	Why did you used to do well at school?  parental approval? things easy for you?  How old are you?    These answers will help you identify what your motivation WAS.  Whatever.  Things are changing- whether it is your age, your circumstances, your friends or interests.  Maybe your work is more challenging and you were used to good grades without effort.     I would suggest a two fold approach.       1. Identify what you want (now, short term, life goals) and set short term mini-goals to achieve.  You need to keep focusing on the long term benefits of what you are doing (university, better salary, independence, freedom, escape from your present circumstances) and keep seeing yourself in the desires circumstances.   Lots of resources on goal-setting and how to manage your time to accomplish.  (ie- "magic of thinking big" by David Schultz; or web resources on goal setting.         2. If things have previously come easily for you - it is possible that you, (like me) never learned how to study.  I was astounded at the resources in the local library, university, web  that taught me how to effectively study, maximize test taking skills, maximize exam results.      Everything can be learned.    Everything is a skill.    Whatever is a problem for you personally - you may not have acquired the skills naturally to learn and manage them....    But- you can learn anything.    even if you get knocked off track by illness, loss, devestation it may take time, but you can come back- refocus - reset goals - readjust goals.  You can come through anything.  Just keep moving-trying-breathing-resting.                 BUT YOU CAN !!!

If I see one more car ad with "Chevrolet" misspelled, I'm going to start hunting people down. Did you put the ad in the right category? Is the subject line descriptive of the item?

The only problem with them is that there is no physical branch to go to, but its really a non-issue 95% of the time. For the other 5%, they have customer service phone numbers and as far as ING Direct goes, they have some of the best customer service out there. ING Direct will pay 2.4% APY for a savings account currently. My regular bank, Suntrust, was only paying me 0.5% before I switched to ING Direct. You can also get $25 for free for signing up if you sign up with someone else's referral information. I can give you my referral information if you would like (I would get $10 as a thank you bonus, but you'll get $25 and the ability to refer friends and family as well.)

NVIDmJpKaa	Hello Emmy:     While being  a paralegal is useful, only the ones with a lot of experience are making any money right now. Also, paralegals now are wearing 2 hats with most firms: clerical and paralegal. An attorney may expect you to do secretarial work for them, in addition to your own clerical work, for the same pay.     In these economic times, you'll find that companies will either settle for far below what the case is worth because people need the money, or will take their chances going to trial on the bigger cases.  Since there are currently too many attorneys without jobs, firms may hire less experienced attorneys in place of paralegals for a lower rate of pay.     A better technical field would be anything medical or health care related -- sonographers, medical technicians (for diagnostics or x-ray), CNAs, or surgery techs. These are the medical equivalent of a paralegal, but will prove to be more stable.      Our population is aging and living longer, requiring more medical support and services. In order to meet that demand, health care providers will look toward the support and technical jobs to maintain their level of quality care. Most of these degrees can be obtained through 2 & 3 year programs.   Be careful in choosing a technical school, make sure you check out their references, the rate of placement (how many of their graduates have they been able to place with reputable health care organizations?) and how they structure your tuition payment.  Don't accept a program that is going to require money up front, or a second mortgage on your parents' house.  There are lots of programs out there for these jobs, so don't be afraid to be picky about where you go to school.  You might even want to call some of the hospitals and find out if they have partnership programs with certain schools.  Their Human Resources Department will be able to tell you who they work with.      Good luck in your training,and much success with your education.|`|C233ATPvaa	Millwright, do you want 80k a year?|`|0a8a4dd17ec2226bd801888dd10c50d2aa	Not Automotive ok..|`|7HDWtqhOaa	If gunner really did make money at that and can prove then try it BUT  You want technical training Emmy, any kind of Medical or Dental tech is the way to go. Just make sure the tech training you get is college accredited and remember people are born, die and get sick in between and there will always be a need for some type of med tech.  Surgical tech is the way to go and you need the hands on schooling and no you don't need to go to regular medical college.

She will also report as taxable income the value of your lodging and food, and you will pay tax on this.    You will file both a Canadian and US tax return. The Canada/US tax treaty does not apply to earned income. Instead, you can choose an exclusion on your US tax return for a certain amount of foreign-earned income, currently $87,600.    And yes, you need to obtain the proper visa to work here.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	The first thing you need is a work visa.  Americans do not have a right to work in Canada except through proper channels.

It's too risky as sellers can modify the auction and if I don't look at it again, I may win something I don't want.    (Sellers have been known to completely swap out the item listed, even though this is against eBay rules.)    Besides, the only thing the sniping program accomplishes is cuts down on nibbling.  You still have to be the high bid to win and if someone else bids their MAX and your bid is less, you will still lose.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Think about it Travis, each of the few decent sniping programs have sold thousands and thousands of copies of their software. A sniping program may let you win more but as there might be other sniping bids in there is still no guarantee you will win. What you will get is a flurry of snipe bids in the last 7 seconds and if one of them bids more than you then you still lose.    Why worry about losing a bid, ebay is such a huge market place there is always another of the same item coming up.     A couple of weeks back i was bidding on a new digital camera from a trade seller who had a number of the same listed. The first listed sold 2 seconds before the end for 113.  The second sold 6 seconds before the end for 106.  The thirds sold 5 seconds before the end for 83.

It was at 5.5% in December when we applied, but in early January the Feds cut the prime to next to nothing and the rates started dropping. We called our mortgage guy and got him to reduce it, but we had to pay .25 points for that rate. It only cost us an extra $650, but will probably save us at least that much in the next 2 years.

The sole purpose of a quit claim deed (QCD) is to transfer or clarify title in situations where something "ambiguous" has occurred in the chain of title.  A QCD is typically done after a Decree has been entered in a divorce case, to extinguish any marital interest in real estate.  In my state, the judge hearing a divorce case would probably consider factors such as: who paid for the real estate; who is on the loan; who is responsible for maintenance of the property, etc., when deciding who gets the property after a divorce.  If you're able to prove you are the only one who has been involved in a property, the judge might grant you the title to the property in the decree.  I would consult an attorney in the state that you want to purchase property and find out the standard case laws surrounding divorces/distribution of property.
yO5tm6e1aa	If you keep an account open and don't use it, eventually the creditor closes the account for you (often without notice).  Contrary to what others have written, you should actively close accounts that are stale.  Keeping them open creates an opportunity for identity theft (e.g. if you move, and are no longer in contact with the creditor).    Those that contradict this are referring to people with high credit card balances.  Let's use 2 examples with your 6 cards.    Example 1:  Card 1 Visa, $10,000 limit, balance $500  Card 2 Mastercard, $25,000 limit, balance $0  Card 3, Retail Store $3,000 limit, balance $0  Card 4, American Express, $20,000 limit, Balance $1,000  Card 5, Gas Store $500 limit, balance $0  Card 6, Dept Store $5,000 limit, balance $0    In Example 1, you have $63,500 in credit and a balance of $1,500.  You can safely close the Retail Store, Gas Store, and Deptartment store since you can use the other cards for purchases their anyway.  That will only change your ration from 2.36% to 2.7%.  This is very insignificant and thus will not damage your score.    Example 2:  Card 1 Visa, $5,000 limit, balance $500  Card 2 Mastercard, $5,000 limit, balance $4,000  Card 3, Retail Store $3,000 limit, balance $1,000  Card 4, American Express, $5,000 limit, Balance $2,000  Card 5, Gas Store $500 limit, balance $200  Card 6, Dept Store $5,000 limit, balance $2,000    In Example 2, you have $23,500 in credit and a balance of $9,700. With a ratio of 41.2%, you're in no position to start closing accounts that provide you more credit (except for maybe the Gas Credit Card since it'll have very little impact on your total ratio).   Your debt ratio is high, and this will show in your credit report.  Ironically, getting more credit cards would improve your score.  But, you can't do it very fast because a bunch of new credit lowers your score temporarily.  A better alternative is to move the balance to a fixed loan, such as a bank might carry for you (e.g. personal loan, or home equity line) which will immediately increase your score.  However, banks are not generous with personal loans and they carry higher interest rates than Equity Lines.  But, they are often cheaper than Credit Cards unless you got a special deal (offered to high scores).|`|VPycXVIlaa	Yes. Keep them open.. When you have the cards open that means you have more available credit. When you close them you no longer have that available credit so your debt to credit ratio goes up which hurts your score.    When you pay them off but leave them open your debt to credit ratio goes down so your credit score will go up.|`|cLtzGveRaa	Depends on the situation how much it affects your score.  If you carry a balance on your cards, cancelling a paid off card will negatively affect your credit used to credit available ratio and send your score plummeting.  If all are zero the ratio remains the same, but you can use less of your credit than before without affecting your score.    Your credit score can be affected by the average age of credit, so if you close an older card, your average age decreases - negatively affecting your score.    If you want to close cards, pay all of them off, then close the newer and/or lower balance cards - one every couple of months - to affect your score the least.    myfico.com has a credit score simulator that can help you in your decisions.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Keep the open forever.  Especially your oldest accounts.  Length of credit history is a whopping 15% of your fico.  And yes, paying your credit card bills in full each month is a great way to get 800+ scores.  And you never pay a penny interest.  If you don't have any credit cards I would get at least one.  Look for one with cash rewards  Use credit cards - don't let them use you.  /

You also probably live in a state where garnishment is not allowed, so they can't touch his pension. His car is probably part of a homestead exemption or other state law.    Could he get in trouble? Depends on what kind of trouble you're taking about. Legal trouble? No. Unless he is committing fraud then this is a civil matter, not a criminal one.

AA11604732	Fed Funds Rates are usually at a slight spread over Treasury rates of comparable maturity (e.g., a few days to a month).  Therefore, the spread between the one year and fed funds rates will be similar to the spread between the one month T-Bill rate and the one year treasury rate.  Historically, these numbers are close.  Since 1962, the FF rate has, on average, been less than a basis point higher than the one year.  Currently, it is about three basis points lower.  It is rare that you will see them being very far apart.      I doubt that you will ever see the Fed Funds rate below the rate of the shortest maturity treasuries.    As for the ten year bond, it is not high because of inflation worries.  In fact, it is lower than it has been since the 1950s.  Between 1968 and 2000 it only went below 5% once.  It is currently below 2.72%  The ten year has a higher yield than the one year bond and the FF rate because it has a lot more price risk, and investors demand to be rewarded for taking on risk.  In addition, very short maturity treasuries have a low yield because of actions by the Federal Reserve to manipulate short term rates.  The Fed does not have the ability to have that kind of effect on longer rates -- so they tend to be where the market thinks they should be.
YbP8WYKGaa	You need to give your request in writing with the gas company paper work and demand the landlord to fix it within certain time.  Do you have a month-to-month lease?  If you do, you should give a 30 day notice to move and look for a better place. It doesn't worth to waste time with a slumlord.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	sorry you didn't know the law.    it is on your side    you have given him 1 mo to repair the problem.  now, seek out 3 licensed contractors who can repair the heater.  HIRE one of them.  YOU must pay them.  Get a receipt, of course.    IF you wish to risk being a bit late with Feb rent, wait for this to be done.  Otherwise, call them now, and withhold the fee for the heater repair  out of March rent.  send a copy of the paid invoice.    If the repair costs more than 2 mo rent, you would have  had a CONSTRUCTIVE EVICTION AND you could have  moved.    sorry about your inconvenience    [why so far out?]    old LA resident|`|mTwn8p79aa	If you want to be nasty about it, here's how to do it.    Give him written notice.  Even if you don't want to be nasty, you should communicate in writing so you've got record of everything.  Tell him about the problem and that you've been without heat for four months waiting for him to fix it.  Tell him if it's not fixed within the next 15 days you will hire someone yourself and deduct it from your next month's rent.    If it isn't fixed on the 16th day, or he hasn't contacted you to tell you it will be fixed by "x" date send him another letter telling him who you have hired to complete the repair.  After the repair is complete you have to pay for it out of pocket.  When it's time to pay your rent, pay it less the amount of the repair with a copy of both letters and a copy of the bill and a letter explaining again what you've done.    You can only do this for things that make an apartment uninhabitable, heat is one of those things.  After you've done this, prepare for a very uncomfortable relationship between you and management.  You'll get no leniency from them in the future.
uvt5W6roaa	You could ask your mom if you could do extra chores around the house. Or you could even just walk dogs, shovel snow (for winter only), babysit, or any extra buisness. I wouldn't think about a job yet, you are still young. Most jobs won't hire until your at least 14, and even then you can't do much. Just stick with simple jobs-you will be suprised at how much money you can make!|`|F3p5iRNIaa	shoveling.
y7Mwptsraa	When it comes to student loans, the deductible amount is the interest that you paid. You should receive a notice from the student loan authority or financial institution showing the amount of the interest. Make a claim on line 319 of Schedule 1.    If you had a homes based business, you can claim the amounts for your vehicle in the proportion that you used the vehicle for your work. For example, if 60% of the kilometers you drove were for business, then you can claim 60% of the maintenance, licensing and petrol. You must have receipts to back up your claim.
JgTNtT9Uaa	Learning how to do for a nice basic site would only take a few months.   But if you don't have time to study, Dreamweaver/CS4 is great. It is a wysiwyg (what you see is what you get) So you basically use the program as if you would in Microsoft word, or Microsoft powerpoint, and it write the code for you. It can be quite expensive though. But you wouldn't need to get the most up to date one, maybe try dreamweaver 8.   I have learnt how to make a nice website in a few month at college, so i have learned how to write the HTML code and use Dreamweaver.     Hope this helps Vik|`|4uB0bbhnaa	Do you mean you want to do the website yourself ?    or are you asking for a recommendation     of someone to do it for you for payment|`|AA11222479	check out www.1and1.co.uk I use them for all my websites.|`|raqQPkwyaa	There are some good site builders on the market but you need to check them out carefully. Look for ones that have the tools needed to build a profitable online business for no extra charge. if they charge for the extras it can add up quickly. Also be sure that there is a good support system. If you get stuck you want to find answers. A good site builder will explain the process in detail and show you how to build pages for the search engines even on the local end. You don't need to know HTML or other tecno terminology as these are wysiwyg site builders. The best site builders will also show you how to generate multiple streams of income and have marketing tools available. Be cautious of the cheap site builders because you may be left out in the cold. Prices do vary but in general expect to pay around 300-500/year for the whole package including hosting with unlimited bandwidth. Some people don't have time to do it themselves and need it done for them and most site builders will offer a service for this at an extra charge. Average costs for this is around 1500.00 for 10 pages but it does get you off to a good solid foundation.|`|uxEThASeaa	If you're from the UK I recommend http://www.hosttell.com/one They are one of the leading European hosting companies (hosting over 500 000 websites), and they currently have a promotion in the UK. They are offering free hosting and a domain (you have to pay the 9.00 setup fee and that's it). Every plan includes Photo Gallery, WebEditor (so you can build a website without knowledge of HTML), Google Adwords coupon (so you can advertise your website on google for free) and a lot more. Check them out.|`|STYhiMEyaa	We use Adobe Go Live in the CS group of products for all our sites.  If you've no experience you can use Word or Publisher.  We used Publisher for the first couple of sites we wrote until we understood more about them and then went on to Go Live.  Go Live is very similar to Dreamweaver.    With all of them, you can just write what you want the site to say and the coding is done for you.  You should get the ftp when you buy your domain name and web space and you just copy and paste your pages into your web space.    Good luck!
e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	If caresource is welfare insurance, welfare insurance doesn't cover dental.      And private health insurance, usually doesn't cover dental.

NVIDmJpKaa	Hello JG:     Most employers ask this question to determine what salary they would offer to the applicant. It's basically to see how low they can go. If you're making $9.50/hr. and the top salary for the new position is $12.00, then they'd offer $10.50 to start.     If the position for which you are interviewing, is a step up from the job you were doing previously, and requires far more of your experience than you were using on your last job, then be confident in asking for at least 20% more than your last salary.      Good luck in your search.|`|cwKNDZz9aa	I never answer it. Think up a tactful way to decline to answer.     I consider that too personal for this stage of the hiring process.    I'd rather not say.     I'm just not comfortable answering that just now.    They will understand. If you do not answer, you win. To the hiring person, it can be a bit of a game. They will not hold it against you. It forces them to try and evaluate you on your merits. It makes their job a little harder, but, hey, that's what they're paid for!|`|0fb9cfa7afed23044f4b019f2438ba2baa	This question is used not only to determine if you fall within the pay range for the position they are hiring but also to verify your honesty. This is a reference question that they are allowed to ask when calling your past/current employer. If you lie on this question it can get you disqualified from the position. If you don't answer it from my experience you would be ruled out of the position as well. Especially in this market they have so many people to choose from they don't need to play games with you. Yes it may mean a lower offer but you can help this by being educated in what the position should be paying, in some cases job postings even state the range. They will usually ask you what you are looking for as well so be prepared for that. As someone else said if you will be using more of your skills it is ok to ask for more than what you are making or if the position is a step up then they would also expect to be paying you more than what you are currently at. good luck with your job search.|`|UnzEIbxgaa	Yeah, I got that a lot when I was interviewing. I think it's a question you can choose to not answer, without it counting against you. You want them to go by your experience, if applicable. However, it is impressive to show them that your experience have earned you a progressively higher pay. For example: Your first job, without any experience, you were making $7.40. Your second job, you have more experience, therefore you were being paid $8.75. So for your third job, it wouldn't be such a huge deal to ask for $9.00 or $9.50. If you have experience, they are gonna expect you to ask for more...possibly more than what they are prepared to pay...but YOU could be worth it. It's all a game.|`|PaKwqlrWaa	You could say you made x amount and now you have gained more experience so you are looking for x$?    I mean if they don't want to pay you what you were making or even more, then you can reevaluate the situation.    A lot of companies looking for professionals are requesting salary history, so they can save themselves time and not waste yours if the position does not pay anywhere close to your expectations.
29jOOWpTaa	You can be both a labor/delivery nurse and a diabetic educator. There are no state laws preventing this. The question is weather there is a job entailing the responsibilities of both positions. Most likely you would have to work part-time at both.

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	I have.  It sucks.  I was one of the 95% who wash out.      Cold calling is HARD, emotionally.  It stinks.  I hate it.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Yes, I did for 3 years. It was hard at first but got easier with practice.   It's very hard to make cold calls. Most people don't want to be bothered. If your interested in selling insurance I would purchase internet leads. Ex. Insuranceleadz is one of them. Can't remember the others, but you can find them on google. We had great success with the leads we purchased in our surrounding zip codes|`|FRqxWj8daa	Yes, I am an active agent now. I absolutely love it. Very rewarding.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	Starts out a little slow (you basically sell to friends and family at first), but once you get rolling it gets easier and easier.  Typically they say you get underpaid for the first 5 years, then from 5-15 years you get paid what you should and after you've been at it for 15+ years you get overpaid for the amount of work you do.    One other note:  If you're company trains you about cold calling, find a different company!  Cold calling is very hard, is very old school and a complete waste of a persons time (what successful person do you know that is fine with sitting around listening to dial tone for 5 hours just to speak with anyone that will say hi?).  People don't want to deal with some random that just picked their name out of the phone book.  Find a company that trains you on how to get referrals and do affinity marketing and you'll succeed.  I've been in business for about 3 years now and I've never made a single cold call.  If you're going to do cold calling, hire someone for $10/hour to do it...don't waste your time doing it!|`|AA10633378	Yes, I do.  I find it not only satisfying but pretty lucrative as well.  One of the other answers here says cold calls are old-school. He is SO right!!!  I've never really made a cold call; everything I do is from warm market referral. Is the business always easy?  Nope, but it is pretty simple.  The part I like the best is being able to make sure that a family is taken care of in an ethical and complete manner and that what I do isn't commission driven, but client driven.  For example, in the past few weeks, I helped a middle aged couple who make between them over $130K and who had only a $10K policy on the husband.  We've getting them both covered correctly so that if something should happen, the survivor won't lose the house; the kids still go to school, neither survivor has to marry just to put food on the table; etc.  Life insurance is the basis for all financial planning; it's not the only thing; but it's most definitely the base of all.
AHyDHombaa	Nobody really knows what's going on.  The most conclusive answer I've heard so far is that there is some kind of computer glitch, and/or problems with the Recovery Rebate Credit.      Don't hold your breath though, I just answered a question from someone who's having problems with "Where's My Refund" for deposits that are scheduled for 2/10/09.      Whatever it is, hopefully they'll have it sorted out by the end of the week.|`|yW1wFR2Saa	A lot are getting delayed the irs has had some problems but I would expect it this Friday mine got pushed back to the 24th|`|TwqIpHJLaa	Very possibly an error on the return.  I've read about 20% of the returns are being rejected and reviewed (delayed about a week or so) because folks had entered the wrong Economic Stimulus Check information.    You (your tax preparer) can verify the info by checking the IRS website for the right info.    http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...    Good luck!
f5405b1b662b7320f92e390e71cad269aa	Absolutely not. You should report it. And buy from someone else. Unless he is the best deal you can get. If he's not the best deal than don't.
G3P5htn7aa	yes it is very likely that the extra $300 was the recovery rebate credit (once known as stimulus check). What a nice surprise for you to get more than expected. :-)|`|AA10223196	Yes, it is probably your stimulus check.  Call and ask your bank where the deposit is from.  They can tell you.
Qqz0H2hEaa	FHA does not require a refrigerator or a dishwasher.    Ask your loan officer about any specific requirements that might apply to your area.  I spoke with an elderly lady that told me that when she bought her house in 1950 VA required a broom closet in the kitchen.|`|FQRjfbW6aa	No it does not have to have a refrigerator unless your contract calls for it.  In my area it is the norm to ask for the fridge to stay.
XZG35fxSaa	Orientation is when they show you around the store, introduce you to everyone, and start your training.  You might have paperwork to fill out too.  In an office job, I would expect to be paid, but I don't know about grocery stores.
T6ZT3A57aa	Have you been accepted the job?  If so then you should be paid for your time during the orientation. If not the orientation may be just to determine whether you are happy to work there after being shown what the job entails.    Most reputable organisations will employ you first, then on your first day or two you will be shown around to become familiar with the place and other workers there. Then you will be shown where you will work and the job you are expected to do, sometimes you will be placed under the direction of another worker there. This is better than just putting you to work on day one without any idea about the work place.
DfIEgDbAaa	That would depend on if you have a tax id or just your ssn.  A corporation has its own tax id number & therefore its own credit history that is seperate from your own.  If you havent gotten one, go to the IRS website & file for one.  It starts you out with no credit but that is almost always better than bad credit.
AA11573642	You can avoid signing any document which is not in conformity with your ideas. The other and equally effective method which i adopt is to sign the document "UNDER PROTEST"and send a detailed letter regarding the discrepancies in the document.|`|Td2G075Eaa	It is best to follow policy and sign, with a caveat at the bottom stating that you do not agree with the write up.  Refusing to sign can lead to termination.    The forms we use for write up actually state that the signature on the form only proves that the matter was discussed with the employee.  We give the employee room to write out his reasons if he disagrees with the supervisor.    We have fired those who refuse to sign for not following policy.|`|neuprBeGaa	Usually, you are not required to sign.  But usually, signing the form is merely an acknowledgment that what your boss said, and what he wrote on the paper match up, and that you were indeed counseled on it.  It does NOT imply that you agree with the criticism.    Meanwhile, failing to sign it is also (unfairly) considered evidence of a negative attitude.  And of course it does nothing to counter the form itself.    A better way to fight is to look for a spot on the form for you to respond, and put your disagreement there.  Then go ahead and sign it.  If there isn't one, demand the right to respond in writing, and for that memo to be filed along with the disciplinary form.    If you're going to fight it, though, you should be sure that you're in the right.  If there's any doubt, you'd do better to meekly accept it, promise to change, and thank them for the correction.
857613b00f17e9b24da4c2f617b245d5aa	Yes. I'm an admin asst/IT person where I work and this guy who was in a higher level position tried to do everything he could to prove/convince the big boss that he needs to fire me immediately. It didn't work.   His office mate got really pissed at this guy for writing me up for not doing my job when I did my job like I'm supposed to. So a few weeks later the office mate called me into a meeting with the big boss where we discussed what this guy did, things he said. This guy was investigated/watched the following week and fired a month later after discovering that what me and the office mate said was fact and not an exaggeration of the truth.|`|qVCUgKfAaa	i do the same thing but the difference is that i am a Professional|`|R94PIATQaa	No, but it sounds like you have.

Almost everything is done on computers these days in school and in hospitals, and using spell check makes things so much easier.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Definitely not!! if you wanna be a nurse be a nurse f**k the spelling! Just practice at it and you'll be better at it in no time! stick to your dreams and they'll come true.|`|jaaeQJv9aa	no, spellings not that related to nursing. nobody knows how to spell the words that youll learn in nursing school before youve been to it|`|ZDiohznsaa	ur thinking of abandoning your dreams of becoming a nurse because your bad at spelling?  No you should definitely NOT consider a different career.  You can absolutely get over this issue.

Forget spelling!|`|nSBCZqJCaa	if your horrible at spelling and if u would like to be a nurse then, just follow what u like. It's just a matter of time practice and you'll do great! :)|`|w1pbRmazaa	ha i suk at speling but its ok i live lol sorry... no if that's what you want to be go for it.|`|5bYpbodUaa	If you want to become a nurse, then go for it. You'll just have to work harder at the spelling of things.  If you really want this, you can do it. I'm certain of it.  Besides, a lot of those medications and medical terminology words are difficult to spell, but once you do it often enough, it will come easy. It will just take time.  :-)    PS: All those other answers that are telling you that spelling isn't important and doesn't apply to being a nurse do not know what the hell they are talking about.  I've worked in the medical profession for over 14 years, and I know first hand how important spelling is! You definitely do not want someone to misinterpret your notes as it is important for patients getting well and for their current stability during their hospital stay.  You don't want someone to misread your words and do something FATAL to a patient. So those people telling you that spelling has nothing to do with nursing, do not know what the hell they are talking about.    YOU CAN DO THIS though...even though you are not great at spelling. You can certainly practice enough to get better and be a great nurse!  :-)|`|soFJptgyaa	ur spelling shouldnt get in the way of what you want to do, all you need is to care for people.if you do then theres no reason why u shouldnt be a nurse.|`|MwFN3DfPaa	My doctor is horrible at spelling.  But now that they have computers in the offices, it helps him.    Also, there's a pocket electronic dictionary, that helps you spell.  Maybe you may invest in one.    Don't give up on something you really want. Just find a way to make it easier for you to enjoy it.|`|9Zxks6cBaa	Defiantly not. Nurses don't need to know how to spell, and if you really want to become a nurse then you should try to work hard and improve your spelling skills. My cousin was a nurse before and she didn't need to spell but the peoples names (which you can ask them how to spell).|`|AA11485286	Spelling schmelling!  If you want to become a nurse -- DO IT!!! I've had professors that admittedly couldn't spell.  Besides, the more you do it, the better you'll get at spelling.  I say... go for it.  The health-care industry is definitely in need of good nurses.  Good luck!!!|`|rsYn5G01aa	If you are ready to give up on nursing because of that then yes. There are a lot of things that you won't be great at, but as a nurse if you try to avoid these things that you are not wonderful at, like spelling, then you will never get better at them. Nursing school takes a lot of focus, dedication and studying. However then you look back on all the things you felt you could never overcome and you see that you did and actually did them very well. Don't be the nurse or person that avoids things that are difficult, the easy things are rarely worth doing. good luck :)|`|VT5Wvj5Raa	Do what you love:)|`|j0zDQQG2aa	Go on a spelling course.

In the mean time you would get the interest write offs of the home and with the inheritance amount of money into CDs. (short term) this would give you some interest for your money. I would be sure to check out the Credit unions in your area they pay more than standard banks.  Then after the 5 years you can pay off the home loan.   My understanding an inheritance is not taxable unless it is over 1 million.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You could not have inherited that much if you still qualify afterwards.    There is no provision preventing you from buying the property with cash, it should be OK for you to claim the credit.   However, your unearned income may put you over the limit.   The limit is "income" not "paycheck" and unearned income counts.

TwqIpHJLaa	When you sell your home, you're selling a capital asset and that can result in income (if it's appreciated over time) and potentially taxes due.  Most folks today, however, are able to exempt the entire gain using a 1997 law.    This law substituted an exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) for the old replacement residence rules. Unlike a previous once-in-a-lifetime exclusion for senior citizens, the new exclusion may be claimed repeatedly, but usually only once every two years.  If the exclusion amount covers the amount of gain, Dad has nothing to report on his tax return.    In the unlikely event Dad made a huge gain on his home...a sum in excess of the exclusion rules, his costs to sell the property can certainly be used to "reduce" the gain on the home which he actually netted.    Hope this helps!|`|AA10469473	No way to answer that without knowing just what the $600 was for - but most likely he can't deduct it on his tax return.|`|Q32FbbeFaa	yeh i think he can|`|fSJn0gQLaa	Yes he should be able to deduct that, if he is doing his own taxes via commercial software that part should be in the HOME section.

1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	this had nothing to do with ethics.    do you consider it ethical/unethical to ask for a new desk at work?  have you considered that, expressed as a percentage of your salary, the two scenarios (you getting a new desk, and him remodeling his office) are roughly equivalent?    this wasn't about ethics, it was about morale, and being comfortable in the room where you spend the majority of your time.  plus, the argument could be made that his spending wsa even more appropriate, because he (like all senior bankers) would consider working less than 100 hours per week to be shamefully selfish and unprofessional.    so given that he might spend 3x as much time in that office as you spend in yours, and that he spent about as much remodeling his office, as you would spend on requisitioning a new desk (on a % of salary basis), the argument could be made that your actions would be more egregious than his.    try that on for size.      as for the bonuses: he had a duty to his employees.  he arranged for his company to be sold to a company which is known for providing significantly less (often more than 30% less) in compensation for employees.    while he was acting in the best interests of his shareholders, he screwed over his employees.  plus, it meant that thousands of them would be fired in the merger.  Thain had a duty to soften the blow as much as possible.    BofA knew what they were getting into when they bought Merrill Lynch.  now they're having buyers remorse, because the assets have depreciated, and they paid a huge premium for a company that would probably have been 75% cheaper now.    weather Ken Lewis was acting responsibly when he acquired MER is another question, though.

The value of one countrys currency is constantly changing against the value of another countrys currency. Forex traders make money through buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market.     Online Forex trading is a nonstop cash market. It is one of the fastest growing industries on the internet. It attracts a wide range of individuals, from beginners to more experienced traders. Anyone with access to the internet, a valid credit card and with a minimum cash deposit can share in the excitement.     There are many affiliate programs. Forex trading is todays most exciting arena for investors as it offers a desirable product with mass market appeal.     How it works   Foreign exchange is an exciting market. Individual traders trade on margin. For example, a stake of just $100 gives a trader access to a deal worth $10,000 (using a leverage of 1: 100). Markets fluctuate constantly and for a margin trader every little move is magnified 100 times. And while potential profit is unlimited, the trader can only lose their initial investment  for this example, $100.     For example:      Leverage (gearing) enables you to hold a position worth up to 100 times more than your margin deposit.

I add up how much I'm going to need for bills and groceries that week and I deposit that into my checking account, and then keep a running tab of how much is there and how much I'm spending. It's easy after a while. The rest of it I keep in a money bag and try to ignore it, only taking what I need for entertainment or whatever comes up. Keeping all of your money in a wallet isn't a good idea... that also tends to vanish quite quickly for me. Hope this helps! Good luck!

The IRS will receive a copy of the 1099-G that you receive.  It will go in their system.  Then they match it up to tax returns, which sometimes takes a few years.  Once they do find that you did not report this income, then, you will be charged interest along with penalties.  Also, this could make the IRS take notice of your future tax returns which could result in a longer period of time to receive any tax refund in the near future.  But if you are not due a refund and owe taxes, then you might as well file it anyway.  Like another person said, the taxes that were withheld from the lottery winnings can also help your tax return.      I would HIGHLY recommend filing your tax return with your lottery winnings included!

AA10921553	Well, in order to answer you properly we need a little more info. Why can you not claim your child? If it is because your ex gets to claim the child, they you could still claim  HOH status, if you qualify, daycare credit, and EIC if you qualify. If you have a court order that states the non custodial gets to claim the child, all that means is you need to sign an 8332 to give the the non custodial. That releases exemption and child tax credit. A non custodial that gets to claim the child per court order, yet the child lives with the custodial over 50% of the time and the custodial provides over 50% of their child's support, cannot claim the child for EIC. The child MUST live with you more than six months out of the year to claim them for EIC. If a non custodial is claiming EIC on this child, it is tax fraud.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	it sounds that since you only paid 2,299.72 in taxes you wouldnt be getting a whole lot back . However you can claim daycare credits although im not sure how much you would get back.|`|AA11132354	Well if you can't claim your child as a dependent, you still may be able to claim them for EIC under special rule for children of separated and divorced parents, which will help.

Doesn't seem to apply here.      The date the account was opened is important for one reason...if the account was held by you (or by your parents for you) for longer than one year (12 months), it's treated as a capital asset and long-term capital gains are very good things (i.e., are taxed at much lower rates).    In fact, for 2008 through 2010, the long-term capital gains rate for some investors will drop to zero.  But before you start planning a fire sale of your stocks and mutual funds, make sure you'll be eligible for this tax break.

O8qdCBzLaa	That $217.50 could be a refundable deposit to secure a unit. For example, I went to rent a place while I was having my house remodeled. And, the apartment complex I chose wanted a $300 deposit at the time of submitting the application to hold a particular unit that I had chosen. But, this was to ensure that I got the unit I wanted and they didn't let someone else have it. And, they required a deposit to make sure that I didn't change my mind, preventing them from renting a desirable unit  to someone else.    Had I decided to live in that complex, I would have had that $300 applied to my deposits. But, I found out a couple days later that they didn't have cable TV at the apartment complex. And, I would have had to get satellite TV service and DSL for the internet (including a new e-mail address). So, I just ate the $300 and went elsewhere.    Generally figure that it's going to cost at least twice the monthly rental to move into a place. This includes the first month's rent, a security deposit of up to another month's rent, pet deposits, pool or laundry key deposits, parking fees, etc.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	We have had to rent apartments over the years while waiting for our new homes to be built.  We have two cats.  There is always a non-refundable fee for cats and sometimes a monthly charge for having them  Those vary in price.  We have never paid an application fee or a renter's fee whatever that is.  We have had to pay a deposit which is the same as one full month's rent usually. But nothing else.  You need to ask specific questions about what all the other fees are about as I have never heard of such a thing.  And you should never sign a lease when you don't fully understand your commitment.  Take charge and ask all your questions and don't sign on unless you are sure you understand and that what they are asking is legal. If not, pass on the apartment.  This doesn't sound like an apartment complex.  It sounds more like a house apartment where they are taking advantage.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	All the fees are pretty standard except the one for $217.50.  Is that the deposit?  I would contact the apartment manager and ask them what that fee is about.

Some places make you hire a carpet cleaner and cleaning crew to come in after you leave.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	YOUR LL is likely breaking several laws.  But that is another battle to fight another day.

I suggest you call a RE broker in your area and let him/her  know what you seek in an apt......get him to find you one.

OacSIfSiaa	If your daughter is covered under insurance then read this:  there is a common practice, known as balance billing, which often is illegal. When doctors or hospitals think an insurer has reimbursed too little, state and federal laws generally bar the medical providers from pressuring patients to pay the difference. Instead, doctors and hospitals should be wrangling directly with insurers.  Balance billing most frequently occurs when medical providers participating in a managed-care network believe the plan's insurer is imposing too deep a discount on medical bills or is taking too long to pay. California, New Jersey and 45 other states ban in-network providers from billing insured patients beyond co-payments or co-insurance required by the plan. Similarly, federal law prohibits providers from billing Medicare patients for unpaid balances.     If your wife is not participating with the divorce decree, you can sue her for her share of the insurance premiums.    Hope this helps

There are some sites that send you emails that you need to click on a link to get credit(usually 1 cent or less) and require you have 30 or more dollars in your account before you can cash out. So that takes forever.    There are other things too but I don't know much about those.
Ch9TedMcaa	Yes.    Money market accounts are more liquid than CDs because if you take the money out a CD early, you will have to pay an early withdrawal fee.|`|2LeJOZZ1aa	Money Market accounts are never a good idea. Why guarantee yourself a loss in purchasing power? If you had a college loan due in one year, ok maybe, or a t-bill would be better, but you said "? may need the money sometime in the next few years," which means you probably can take on some risk in order to increase your purchasing power. The recent turmoil just means you can buy stocks at a lower price. If the market was at it's top, would you say it's a great time to buy? Probably like most people, but it's the worst time to buy, just like when the market nears the bottom it's a great time to buy but everyone thinks it's the worst time. Investors need to grasp this simple concept. You don't have to buy the riskiest stocks, just buy some some big company stocks like Exxon or PG, they aren't going to go bankrupt, and you're buying them cheap.|`|opJjLRC0aa	If your main concern is safety and being able to pull your money out anytime that you want to then a money market fund is the best way to go. If you are willing to lock up your money for 6 months to a year then you could probably get a higher rate of return putting your money in to a CD. Investing in Stocks would be the best chance for a young person like yourself to make decent returns however if you will need the money within the next couple of years and you are pretty conservative, then the stock market would probably not be a good idea.

OtYAkRrRaa	As a teen I worked at Baskin Robbins (ice cream).  You can try a lawn mowing business. I hire a friends son to do mine.  A bookstore. A grocery store stocker and clerk|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|AA10651118	Please dont believe those spam website.. I made the horrible mistake of joining one.

Most major places requires 18+ minimum. If you want a job, probably best chances are in supermarket, or fast food. I know its boring but its one of few places that hire when your 16. If you have a YMCA in your area apply lifeguard there, usually 16+ is it. You might also want to take the Swim Instructor course as most cases lifeguard are a bit unwanted...(for every hour I work as guard, it gives ratio to 10 hours of instructor)  Don't trust internet of mail offers simply most of those are questionable origin and potentially dangerous to your security (IE Social Security number)  Good luck

Firstly make an appoiment with another manufacture and have them sponsor you and give them a percentage of the profit when you can handle it your self and sales a up you should brake apart and keep making cars.But you neeed to make the name popular and knbown. The easy way is ato get a advertising company to do that fror you but  that can cost 150 000. so you could also use the net, put vids on youtube and rival itbwith a nother car and it would ussually come up on the rival cars search. People would know your car and the name would spread. But the car has to have a purpose( like peformanc e value, guys with fat pockets or economy and safety0 to convise your sponsores, by thg way my car is called aerial gt(pleaz dont copy the name i know i can trust you) and whatys yopurs? im very interested in your progect pleaz put a reply and tell me what its called if you give me the best answer  PLEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

Also, a company advertising that much on TV is putting a large investment into the company and needs to keep its reputation. It's a whole lot different from some guy sending you a spam email or posting on Craigslist.    Almost as important, though, is what they pay. You can't expect them to pay the London spot price, but they should get kind of close to it. Someone paying 50% of spot, in my opinion, would be ripping people off.

However, there's nothing stopping you from opening your own business doing websites, pc repair, etc.  When you hit 16 or 17 and in some cases 18 (I'm not sure of your state's labor laws) you could find work easily at local computer stores and it won't take long to become the manager of the repair/service department if that's what you want to do.      I would recommend that you start now participating in groups (with parental permission, of course...) where you can make connections that you can use to find these jobs in the near future.  Check meetup.com and other places for computer related and coding groups.  I go to the PHP user's group here in Houston, TX sometimes and have met many contacts that keep me full of PHP and MySQL development work.      You can also take a look at hosting companies, participate in Google code projects, etc. and hopefully get noticed by them.

This was the response they gave which makes me happy after looking for so long.    Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.      What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.    Try local grocery stores, pizza parlors, retail stores, fast food restaurants.|`|iBMvPeT0aa	Hey Im a 17 year old male too and I work in a grocery store too and it kinda sucks, so i can understand where you are coming from.  I personally would never work fast food  but maybe look into being a barista (someone that makes coffee) at like a starbucks or maybe Dunkin Donuts or another local coffee shop. A lot of my friends work at Indigo and love it another option would be a retail store in the mall. Hey, if its at a cool store you like at least you will get a good discount! Good Luck!

Hence the reason for it to be in writing.  It is better to give a verbal of the 30 day and it is followed with it in writing. This is why all things should be in writing and of course you will always have a copy.  Now that you are out and the pipes have leaked or blew as you put it, would not be any more your responsibility even if you lived there today.|`|vCePK8gMaa	No written lease generally leaves you with a verbal month to month tenancy. If Nebraska landlord tenant laws require a 30 day notice to terminate a month to month tenancy, then you can be held liable for the rent through the 30 day notice period, which could actually end up being an extra month.     If the pipes in the basement "blew" due to your negligence (lack of heat, etc) then the repair is on you as well.     Yes, the landlord can sue you for both rent and damages.
DGFu03Q3aa	Dear tex:  Depends on a lot of factors. The 1040EZ can be used if your income is below $100,000 and no EITC advanced payments and you do not have any children etc. The 1040A also has its set of rules as well as the full 1040. Pull all three from the IRS.gov/forms web site and see which ones fits your situation.  If you purchase software to do your taxes the software will fill out the correct form.

g9qiRBviaa	It's a good idea to maintain credit cards in one way or another for the sake of your credit report, but yes, we too are paying off all our cards and going cash-only.    We actually spent something like $50 last year in credit cards, can you believe it? I was very proud of my family for that.    There's only one more card to finish paying off and we have zero balances all the way.    We are going to just maintain this way until the economy picks up a little. Then we'll be making small expenditures regularly that we can pay off in full each month in order to keep our credit score up there.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	If you can afford to go all cash why don't you get a credit card with at least 1% back on all purchases.  Just make sure you don't spend money on anything you can't afford.|`|f7bcc960cd2e00baa34eee0e5a77df9aaa	In my opinion you always want to have credit cards, and increase your credit score. If you wish to be paying by cash, then only spend on the card what cash you have. Pay off your cards at the end of the month. This will help maintain your credit score.     Personally I have been taught that you have to have some small balance to increase your score, so leaving $50-100 is not going to hurt, if you pay everything else off.    If you are concerned about your APR, then call the credit card companies and ask them if they are giving you the lowest percentage rate as possible. They usually will offer something low for 6 months, and then something higher for no limit.... Take the 6 month, and then call back again 6 months later :)

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You seem to be forgetting she is bringing them into HER home as well.   She has every right to entertain guest, you are not her mother, you can not dictate who an adult woman associates with.    The only legal right you have is to forbid her to move any of them in.   They can stay up to 14 days as a legal "guest".|`|AwaOvor7aa	I saw a similar case on Judge Judy. Because the landlord shared the same property and her safety was vulnerable to the other roommate's choices, she was able to restrict visitors. Consult an attorney near you. The police may give you advice and then you may find out later it wasn't legal. It may cost you a few hundred dollars, but it's worth it to save your life. Also, try to get the other roommate to agree to confront the first with you.    How much longer does she have on her lease? Does she have an unwritten privileges you can take away- a good parking spot, sharing the big bathroom, the tv? Certain utilities can be cancelled if they are in your name (phone, cable, internet), but others must be left on (heat, lights etc).     For the moment, I'd get a huge lock on my bedroom door at the least. Maybe borrow a pet snake or something. For $75 you can get a background check on someone.Start with one on her; in certain places if she failed to disclose certain info on the application you can evict her for fraud.  If you get the names of the 'guests' and find something scary out (start with google or your home state criminal justice reports online) that might convince her.    If you come home and they are unaccompanied in your home, you may have the right to ask them to leave or call the police b/c they are trespassing. You probably can't do much if she is actually there.     Make a good inventory of all your items, their serial numbers, makes/models etc. Take pictures.  Give her notice (sent via registered mail), that if she invites people to your home and they steal/damage items she will be financially and criminally liable. But don't be too rude or aggressive, she may throw a party for real.     Also, consider a nanny cam. They are fairly cheap. Get one that records video, not just transmits it. If you see her doing something illegal you can call the cops to your place. You can watch the recording later. Be sure to check the privacy laws. You may end up in court if you put the camera in the bathroom or something. It might be worth hiring a private detective for a day or two. Depending on your job, maybe you can do a services trade with a PI.

If she doesn't provide more than half of her own support, lived with you over half the year, and nobody else has a higher claim to her than you do, you can claim her.  If your mom wanted to claim her, she could and then you couldn't.    When she turns 19, the rules DO change.  If she meets all the above rules and is also a full time student, you could still claim her as a qualifying child.  Otherwise, if she earns over the amount of a personal exemption for that year (was $3500 for 2008, goes up a little every year) you can't claim her.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	You sure can as long as she is not working or filing her own tax return.|`|nMgsLNAAaa	you must be 25 AND legal guardian|`|ExSTxiBWaa	If you are still providing over half of her support, you can still claim her.

There are certain rules for what the IRS calls a "Qualifying Relative", whom you can claim as a dependent.  They are described on page 22 of the 1040A instructions (link below) (and those directions also apply for the 1040EZ and the full 1040).    I recommend you review those instructions, but it sounds like you can claim her - assuming that you are providing more than half of her support, she earns less than $3500 per year, and she is not claimed as a dependent on anyone else's tax return.    Hope this helps.    Susan, TurboTax Tax Compliance Service manager|`|VrLnsdPoaa	Hello, Yes you can claim your sister,and everyone else in the household as long as you have provided more than 50% of thier support, and they have no income and nobody else claims them as a dependent.

5add0e5b0101bc484cffc56a53be5c21aa	Not guaranteed. Principal will be at risk. But you can get really attractive returns in high quality investment grade corporate bonds and high quality municipal bonds. You would buy them through a mutual fund. Bonds have a coupon payment and a maturity date. You would get these coupon interest payments on a set schedule which ranges from monthly to quarterly to semi-annually. If the companies have the money, you receive your interest. Along the way your principal fluctuates in value (the bonds are traded at different prices). If you need your money, then you risk selling at a loss. But if you can wait until the maturity date and at that time the companies or city/state governments have the money, you get paid back your principal that you invested. Sometimes, like now, when people are panicked, you can buy the bonds below their original price and get paid the original coupons, so you are getting paid a good interest rate AND if they can repay you later you get the added return from the principal return being more than you originally paid for the bond. Investing with the correct maturity/duration is the most important thing you can do in bond investing. The other is diversifying so that you don't risk being locked into all your bonds for long times as inflation soars and your 5% is not so good any more. You can make nice returns in the 3-5year time frames now.
8serxyLuaa	Integrity is an element of character fundamental to professional recognition. It is the quality from which the public trust derives and the benchmark against which a member must ultimately test all decisions.    Integrity requires a member to be, among other things, honest and candid within the constraints of client confidentiality. Service and the public trust should not be subordinated to personal gain and advantage. Integrity can accommodate the inadvertent error and the honest difference of opinion; it cannot accommodate deceit or subordination of principle.     - from http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/5...    --------------------------------------...

RTOmb6vxaa	As a former EAFB resident, I can tell you Cal City really is the best place to buy.  Lancaster and Palmdale are, in my opinion, awful. It's  approximately a 45-50 minute drive from Lancaster to the flight-line.  You'll also want to steer clear of Rosamond, unless you like people making meth next door to you.      California City is a good place to buy because you will always be able to at least rent the house out to others stationed at the base.  Most of our friends who lived off base, chose to live in Cal City because it's close to base and provided easy access from the North entrance.  Really, the biggest downside to Cal City is that there isn't much to do.  If you do choose to buy in Cal City, I would seriously recommend looking at pool homes, it gets really freakin' hot out there.      Good luck, and welcome to EAFB.|`|C1wNq8Hkaa	If you want to buy a house you should really consider palmdale. They really have cheap houses.

Sure enough, a few of my friends who bought the software gave up after a while ( and also because the current economic climate makes it almost impossible to have a HELOC ).    You can save the money, and do far better, by simply setting aside a small amount extra to pay down the mortgage principal with - say, $50 or $100 per month.  That does the same effect without the agonies of trying to transfer money here & there all the time.

In some cases for as little as $100 in deposits they give you $100-125 if you leave your account with them  6 months. You then close the account if you no longer want the extra statement paperwork, get sent your statement of interest received at year-end and pay your tax on it in April. 100% returns for 1-hour of work max. $100 in an hour is more than most of us bill for in our jobs.

If you sell now and wait for recovery you will likely miss some big rallies and then ened up paying a higher price. The next big rally can recapture your losses, 401ks don't exactly invest in the worst stocks so your losses are limited and they are already spread out amongst various stocks. If they go down some more, so what, they'll go back up, they always do.|`|10b88dfacbfa580775699cb9564ace9daa	I would be more than happy to guide you as well, as I work in Financial services.  Three main factors you want to consider, your goals for the funds, your risk tolerance, and how long you will have until you will be drawing from the account.  When you have a longer time period to invest, generally you want to have a larger position in stocks.  Closer to retirement, less stocks and more bonds and short term investments.  Stocks historically offer the highest returns, but also are the most volatile.    One thing I highly discourage you from doing is trying to time the market.  Timing the market is extremely difficult and you have a greater chance of timing it wrong which will really hurt you in the long run.  Keep in mind that market fluctuations are normal, and expected.  Assuming that you are not close to retirement, Its much better to take a long term approach (riding the fluctuations both up and down, and gradually reducing you exposure to stocks as you get closer to retirement, then to try to time the market.  A natural and common mistake is to sell stocks and bonds now while they are lower because they arent performing well, then getting into more conservative investments that may offer a very modest interest rate.  Then after feeling more comfortable with the market, usually after the market has gone back up, people get back.  More often than not, people get back in at a point higher than where they sold.  This has two major implications.  You are realizing or locking in that loss by selling low now, and missing out on the recovery and the markets very unpredictable upswing.  Sure you may have made 1, 2 or maybe 3 percent for the time being but you've done yourself more harm then good if you would have just stayed with your strategy.  Over the last 80 years the stock market has marched steadily upwards.  Every 3-8 years roughly the market will have periods of declines.  Invest for the run, and stick with your strategy.  Never time the market. Even experts can not consistently predict the market.  This is very general education, not specific to your exact situation of course. Definitely consider your overall goals for these funds, risk tolerance and how long you have until retirement before making your decisions.|`|4gMdp2nwaa	If you are 40, you still have some ways away till retirement. This may be a hard thing to do but I would recommend keeping your investment alone.     It is true that prices may fall with all the uncertainty in the coming year or so, but if you have the patience to weather the storm I think that there is a good chance that five years from now people will think that valuations that we have at this present moment were cheap.    There is no guarantee of that of course, but in the long run I believe that we will resolve some of the issues that we have with the economy.

C7Mfo0soaa	The background checks will close doors but not every door.  I know that three years of sobriety can seem like an eternity, but to a hiring manager that person would be a risk.  It would be beneficial for him to show employers that he did get a degree AFTER the felony and that he is "rehabilitated."  The more time he has and work experience beyond this, the better.  Some states are more friendly than others with hiring felons and sealing records.  Some employers only care if the crime committed is related to the job i.e. if it was grand theft a bank will most likely not hire him.  It is a small minority, but some companies don't use background checks alltogether.  For strange reasons the background checks come up clean even though they aren't.  I have more than one convicted felon close to me that has a high powered, high paying job.  I would advise him to not lie on an application now and explain the situation to the hiring manager.  He may want to take his chances later on with not mentioning it on an application, but it is a risk.    The most important thing here is that the job doesn't matter if he doesn't stay sober.  He needs to understand and expect that some doors will be closed to him.  This isn't the end of the world for him and  he can't give up.  Something will come up for him.|`|NfpN1Fyuaa	Getting a job right now in general is a struggle, having a felony record makes it even harder...but not impossible.  My boyfriend has several felonies on his record and he has a good paying job, meanwhile I have a college degree, years of management experience, and I'm struggling to get even a minimum wage retail job.  So it's definitely no impossible.    So congrats on him turning his life around and getting sober.  He actually sounds a lot like my bf.  Basically what my bf did in the both locations that we've lived at was this.  TEMP AGENCIES, some of them won't hire ex-felons, but most of them will.  Just go in, be honest with them about his past from the get go, and be open as to what type of jobs he might try.  My boyfriend is currently working some hard manual labor at a tire manufacturer, however the pay's great and they are willing to pay for him to go to school for mechanical engineering if he chooses to.  Good luck to him.

This is the price that people pay when they have felony charges over their heads, my brother has been struggling for almost 15 years with this.

Qqz0H2hEaa	It is a kind of catch 22, you are right.    But in my area the property taxes are going to be about 2.8% or the purchase price per year. In an area just 20 miles away it might be 2.0% or 3.5%.  The city, school and county all sit their own rates.  I don't know how your area is.   The insurance depends not only on how valuable the house is but how good your credit is and how large a deductible you can stand and a whole host of other variables.    I think these sites are trying their best to warn you that these costs might make up a quarter of your house payment or even more and you need to think about them when you are looking at houses.

oTSB5BITaa	The deduction should be made for the year it was paid to the health providers, not the year(s) you pay the credit companies. The IRS allows you to deduct only the amount that is in excess of 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, and you cannot deduct any of the finance charges charged by the finance companies.    Example: If your adjusted gross income for the year was $50,000, 7.5% of that is $3750. If your total out-of-pocket medical expenses for the year is $4000, you can claim a deduction of $250. If your total medical expenses are $3000, you can't claim anything.    Remember that your medical expenses include all out of pockets expenses that were paid with after-tax dollars (prescriptions, co-pays, etc..). You cannot claim health insurance premiums or HSA contributions if paid through your employer, because they are paid with pretax dollars.|`|AA10469473	The year paid - and only the part that is for principal, not any interest.

If you collect from the baby sitter's homeowners insurance (and you collect more than your deductible and copayment), your health insurance company will expect some of its money back.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	Ask the police when you phone them or maybe child protective services would know..|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Nope.  Several reasons.     First of all, YOU can't put a claim in under someone else's homeowners policy.  Only they can.  It's not like car insurance.    Second, homeowners, is PERSONAL liability only.  It doesn't cover anything, related to a business - like babysitting, or daycare.  So anything related to her babysitting business, isn't covered.     Thirdly, even if she DID have a business liability coverage on this, it doesn't pay accidental injuries.  It would have to be negligence, something she deliberately did or didn't do - and abuse (through neglect) or molestation, is ALSO specifically not covered under business liability.      So, no coverage.  But I'd DEFINATLY find another sitter.|`|9FxR4khCaa	You need to find out if your daycare had liability insure to cover this. If they were licensed through the state, they should have this.

For buying houses for example big mortgage agencies look for numbers above 620.  The closer to 700 or above the better.  Anything under 620, you will have trouble. tips to improve your credit are attached. but include things like paying bills on time, staying current with payments, keeping balances low on your credit cards, not having a ton of credit cards.
qHKdksDdaa	1. Depends on if you work in a retail pharmacy (CVS) or hospital setting. But you have to verify prescriptions, make sure you're dispensing the correct medication, counsel patients, make sure pharm techs are doing their job correctly, compound (mix) some medications, order medicine. That's just some of the duties.  2. Again it depends on where you work, but the retail pharmacy works with customers ALOT. Computers are very important too.  3. Salary ranges from 65K to over 100K depending on experience and position.  4. Not sure about benefits. Again, it's about the employer. Retail pays more and may have mnore benefits.  5. You need to complete undergraduate studies that are very heavy into chemistry and biochemistry. No Bachelor degree is necessary, but you have to be accepted into an accredited pharmacy school program in which you will recieve a doctoral degree in pharmacy.  6. With others. To what extent depends on the job.  7. Most pharmacists work day hours, but they can be long and you're on your feet ALOT. You can also work overnight and weekends probably for extra money, but your schedule depends on what you and your employer work out. Pharmacists are in high demand, so they're going to want you to work alot.  8. Most of the work is very routine. Some customers/patients could give you a challenge, or you could have trouble reading a script. Otherwise it's the same things everyday.  9. Advancement depends on what you want. Do you want to be a manager? Supervisor? Just depends on the job. I'm not sure about what schooling you could do after getting the pharmD, but pharmacists are expected to keep up on their continuing education.    Hope this helps!

He doesn't have to be on the lease because he isn't your spouse.  Anyone can live with you and not be responsible for the rent  and other expenses according to the landlord.  In the future if you decide to marry, this could be a problem.  He needs to clean up his credit if you ever expect to marry.  And be aware that because of his condition you will be carrying him for all your life.  This is more important than just bad credit.
dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	I am surprised you have not received a letter from Exam Dept for over reporting your income. To amend your tax return use Form 1040X.  File a separate Form 1040X for each year you are amending. Mail each form in a separate envelope. Be sure to enter the year of the return you are amending at the top of Form 1040X. The form has three columns. Column A shows original or adjusted figures from the original return. Column C shows the corrected figures. The difference between Columns A and C is shown in Column B. There is an area on the back of the form to explain the specific changes being made and the reason for each change. Attach any forms or schedules that are affected by the change. Generally, to claim a refund, Form 1040X must be filed within 3 years from the date of your original return or within 2 years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. Returns filed before the due date (without regard to extensions) are considered filed on the due date.     Attach copies of any forms or schedules that are being changed as a result of the amendment including any Form(s) W-2 received after the original return was filed.   Tax forms can be obtained by calling 8008293676 or visiting www.irs.gov   Normal processing time for Forms 1040X is 8 to 12 weeks from the IRS receipt date.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You can file an amended return Form 1040-X until April 15, 2010.

I don't believe she had insurance.  If she HAD collision coverage, they would have paid for the actual cash value of the car, less her deductible.      The insurance company does NOT pay her the rent that she paid to the car owner.  They pay - and they pay the car owner - the ACTUAL CASH VALUE of the car.  With a LEASE, that's ALWAYS less than lease payoff.   You can't collect money for something you don't own.  And you don't own a leased vehicle.     She never HAD a car, a lease is a long term rental.  And it's ALWAYS a bad deal.  She went into a bad deal, there was NO WAY to come out ahead.  There never is, with a LEASE.|`|PlIZ0ShXaa	The insurer's obligation is to the owner of the vehicle, not the driver or leasee.  Since it was total loss, they paid the owner of the car who leased it to your friend.  She did not own it and had no financial loss.    As for her injuries, this should be covered under either PIP, MPC, or Uninsured Motorist coverage.  She should pursue this with the insurer.  If they deny this claim, she should hire a personal injury attorney who will take the case on contingency - meaning she does not pay the attorney - the attorney takes a portion of the settlement.  there are plenty of attorneys like this in the yellow pages.    They will not be able to pursue the hit/run driver unless she gave them a tag  .  They are not magicians.  If the police couldn't find the driver, why would you expect an insurance adjuster to?

Be direct and be very assertive.  Show that you are goodat talking.  Bartenders are needed to help bring business.  Appearances is more important than knowledge.     experience is more important in some ways. If you have the desire and ability then that is the best of both worlds for a bar owner  /  manager.

g9qiRBviaa	Personally, I would Google it or call the Better Business Bureau.    But if they are asking for anything from you in advance, such as your credit card number "for verification purposes only," steer clear. It's practically assured that they will "accidentally" automatically bill you "at the end of the month" for some amount and then give you the run-around for the next year while you try to get your money back.    I'm not trying to be cynical, I'm just saying this because you say you got a letter referencing "working from home," and that it's a mailing business...so I'm just putting two and two together.    Good luck and please do not give out any of your information to any company whose office you can't physically visit, sit down in and get interviewed at.

ODGWM7vUaa	It is possible to make an average of $500-$1000 a month day trading.  Start with $20,000 in an account. And try to hone in strategies that work for you.    One strategy: Follow the Indexes. focus on strong companies that will more than likely survive this volatile market.  purchase a large amount of shares when the Dow Jones, S&P, and Nasdaq move down or to lows, maybe 7,700. Once the market bounces back in the following days  sell. It is important to take your profits.    Another strategy: use upcoming earnings anouncements. we are in he middle of earning reports. people tend to overreact earning reports. if you feel a sector is going to announce negative numbers short because owners are going to oversell driving lower prices.

Examples of untaxed income and benefits include:    Social security benefit payments    Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and certain other federal assistance payments to poor families    Court-ordered child support payments made by one parent to the other parent    Alimony payments to one's former spouse    Interest earned from certain municipal bonds
Tu9S1WaNaa	Yes, but you have to have paypal.  You can get a paypal account with your debit card and bank account.     You have to confirm your debit card or bank account before you can use paypal.  This takes about 3 weekdays to get done.      When you first put a credit card or bank account on paypal, they will credit that card or account a small fee of like a few cents. Sometimes they do 2 transactions. You have to find out how much the fees were. Call your  bank and find out how much the fees were. Get the exact amount of the fees and go to "confirm account" on your paypal. It will then guide you through.    You have to use your bank account on paypal to get money back from paypal:)  .

But I will tell you that Enterprise is the sleaziest of car rental agencies.  My husband rented a vehicle on a business trip and had a partner traveling with him.  He was charged after the fact $700 for damages to the front end of the vehicle.  He had no accidents and no damage was done to the vehicle while he had it.  We had to get American Express involved and they handled it but Enterprise is totally unscrupulous in their dealings.  We would never use them again and haven't  My car dealership used Enterprise as their loaner vehicles when I had maintenance work done and ceased using them due to their unsavory practices.  You might need an attorney.  And in the future stay away from Enterprise.|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	If you rented the car, you are required to pay for it.

To practice law, a law school J.D. is required and one must also pass one's state bar exam and a professional ethics exam.    Corporate law attorneys must have good reading, writing, communication, and analytical skills which are, generally speaking, the core skill sets any good lawyer should have.

To get a copy of her return from the IRS go to this web site:    http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc156.html    Lee, Enrolled Agent    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.
BekZqSeJaa	Your best bet here it to consult a tax professional, but you could also contact the entity that settled the debt.   They might have written off the loss in 08 which is why you got your 1099C later.      There is also a possibility that you don't have to pay taxes on this if you were insolvent.     Another common objection to debt settlement is that debtors whose debts are partially canceled outside the bankruptcy system will need to report the canceled portion of the debt as taxable income. (IRS Publication 908)    The IRS considers $600 or more of forgiven debt as taxable income.[citation needed] The forgiving creditor must provide the taxpayer with a 1099-C tax form. This form will list the amount of forgiven debt and interest in Box 2. Taxpayers with portions of personal loans forgiven may not subtract the interest reported in Box 3 from the amount of reportable income on this form.    However, the IRS does not require taxpayers to report forgiven debt if the tax payer was insolvent at the time the creditor forgave the debt. Being insolvent means that the amount of a debtors debts are greater than his/her assets (how much money and property the debtor owns). However, the IRS adds that you cannot exclude any amount of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you are insolvent.    For example, if a taxpayer is $10,000 in debt and owns $3,000 in assets, he/she cannot exclude more than $7,000 of forgiven debt from his/her income tax. Any forgiven debt over $7,000 that year must be reported as taxable income.
frubqJB6aa	I used to work for Avon and Oriflame, i used to go out every night giving out brochures, was stressed out running a team, delivering orders chasing up people who hadn't paid me yet, going to appointments and people not bothering to be there.     I was trying to earn money but i was unintentionally neglecting my children and family.    I tried to build a team but found most people would not be serious in the business and would leave and wasted all my times training them doing 2 or 3 appointments.    It came to the point where i was exhausted and realised i wasn't making any profit that was worth staying.     I realised that if i had put all my effort into running my own business for the last 2 years i would be much better off.    I started my own business doing something i really enjoy selling baby clothes and it was the best decision ever.

P8vRwsZSaa	Firstly well done for enquiring online for a networking opportunity.    I cant tell you which company to go for but i can give you some tips when it comes to what to look for.     You can waste a lot of time and emotional capital on waste of time ventures if you do not do your home work.  In vest some time and do the homework.    Firstly, Look for companies that are past the start up phase,  a lot of networking companies like the rest of the economy don't last past start up so look for companies between 5-12 years old.      2. the older companies while being very stable will have commission plans designed many moons ago and will there fore be harder to make any real money in those plans.     3. Look at where there trends are heading,    Don't just pick a company because you like the product.  I'd love to own a MacDonald's franchise , I hate their burgers..  its a business and business is about the money not just the product. Having said that look for something unique in The product fits the market.     4.  stay away from tech based MLM companies.    it just does not fit the model well enough and a  lot will have a heavy front end charge    5. Check out the management.  have they been there before     6. Also make sure the compensation plan pays the field accordingly   a lot of companies will say "we pay up to 63% and then you dig a little deeper and find out its closer to 38%    7. Make sure the team you are joining has experience to give you guidance in building your business. you Don't want the blind leading the blind.     8.  Also most importantly of all.  make sure the team you are joining has a settled system you can execute. if you cannot  do what your sponsor is doing then you are done for.      I hope this helps.

7HDWtqhOaa	Well you are off to a good start, I would go with Wyo tech if possible and ain't no better class than a job at a import custom shop.

As far as a business goes and running it UTI and wyo tech are good to, but wont give you college credit, get your BA in business and then after the apprentice work in a shop it will fall in place and save your money so you can buy and build your shop or qualify for a business loan and keep track of your credit and credit score  And good luck
AA11917574	If you have an accident where you hit a deer the claim is going to be a comprehensive claim.  The premiums may go up SLIGHTLY due to a claim being turned in but that will vary from company to company.      In your case if a person did hit a deer and their rates were going to go up they would not get a letter from their insurance company, they would get the policy renewal showing the increased premium.  If you need to show proof that the premium is going to go up you would need to do a letter (on letterhead-make some up) from the insurance company stating that the premium will increase X amount for the next policy term.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	So, It's not clear what you want.

OacSIfSiaa	First of all, if they sent notice the account was canceled, then there is no longer any legal contract and they breached any agreement you may have made with them in writing.  If you did not get a payment agreement in writing then you have problems.    This is why one must NEVER make payment offers until they check to see if the debt is legal to collect.  It if was beyond your states SOL then you reset the clock and now they can take it to court and seek an order for wage garnishment only AFTER they get awarded a judgment.    Because you moved due to a job transfer, then they must go through the courts in the state you now reside in.  If you simply moved out, then they could seek a judgment in the original state.    Before they can garnish any wages, they must provide your employer with copies of the "order of garnishment" issued by the court.  Also if you live in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina or Texas then they are prohibited from garnishing your wages.  Some states also prohibit the act if you are sole supporter for a family.l    Hope this helps answer your question.

AA10186260	Most banks offer bonuses to entice customers.  You can usually get a bonus online pretty easily or via an actual bank in your hometown if you open a savings/checking account:    ING Direct and other internet based checking/savings accounts frequently pay a lot more interest than "normal" banks. The only problem with them is that there is no physical branch to go to, but its really a non-issue 95% of the time. For the other 5%, they have customer service phone numbers and as far as ING Direct goes, they have some of the best customer service out there. ING Direct will pay 2.4% APY for a savings account currently. My regular bank, Suntrust, was only paying me 0.5% before I switched to ING Direct. You can also get $25 for free for signing up if you sign up with someone else's referral information.

And if he's already being audited for last year and did similar things then, he'll probably end up in jail and the business will be shut down.

If they didn't explicitly ask you in so many words if you wanted to cancel that number and request a new card, then call them back and make sure this is being done.    Okay.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay    Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.    Instructions:    Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.    Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred".     -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy?     Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready.     Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top.     Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item.     Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great.     Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.     Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person.     *Tips*    -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay.     -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.    -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.    -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly.     -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell!     -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping.     -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.    -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller!     -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid.     -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for.     -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.    -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it.     -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reas

f7bcc960cd2e00baa34eee0e5a77df9aaa	There are two ways of looking at credit scoring. My aunt and uncle have always paid their credit cards in full every month, and have high scores (from what I have heard). My parents on the other hand have always carried some sort of balance on their cards, and they as well have high scores.     Since you are looking at carrying some small balance, then see if your credit card companies will lower your interest rate. Most people pay a high interest rate without realizing that they can get it lowered simply by calling in and asking. Take the lowest interest rate offered, even if it is for a few months. When the time is up, call back in and see what is available :)|`|1e8PFtgbaa	Hi...I work for a mortgage company for the last 6 years so I have extensive experience with how the credit rating system works...As long as you don't pay your card 30 days late and you are paying on time you should not see a negative impact on your credit score.  The rule of thumb is pay your card down to at least 50% (30% is the golden number) of your balance in relation to your limit (example: $100 limit...balance should be no higher than $30 to $50).  Also, keep in mind if you pay your card off don't make the mistake of closing out the card,,,that will definitely negatively impact your score.  30% of your credit score is rated on how you pay (No 30 day late payments) and another 30% is based on your utilization ...That is 65% of your credit score right there so if you are doing good in these two areas, chances are your credit is safe.  If you are able to at least pay on time,,you should honestly be okay if you already have a good credit rating.

They are not YOUR parents (yet) and living in separate units of a duplex is not them "living with you" which would be required to claim an unrelated person.    Either you or your fiance, but not both, can file as head of household if you claim one of your children, and can show that you are the person who provides over half the cost of running the household - usually that would be the higher-paid of the two of you.

Poor credit nearly always means you lack skill managing money.  Your best course of action is to stop digging yourself further into a hole with more debt.  Find and attend a Dave Ramsey "Financial Peace University" course.  They're held at churches, are very reasonably priced, and you will learn skills for handling your finances so that you have far fewer "emergencies" and don't have to go into debt nearly as much.

How will you pay that debt PLUS the mortgage on a new house?|`|ICLekd2Vaa	bush did pass a law on this subject, but im sorry to say im unclear on all the details, though urs sound about right.|`|8RNPlSAfaa	I suggest talking to a lawyer!!!|`|rLP9wjPtaa	If the new mortgage company figures you qualify, I don't see how they could prevent you....but a bankruptcy lawyer might decide to force you to sell the new home...|`|AA11132354	You have legal obligations.  You bought the house, you promised the bank to pay for it.  NO you can not just default and walk away free.    Probably you won't qualify for a loan on a second house, anyway.  And this query says your word is no good.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think you need to talk to a real estate lawyer.|`|RluCMVUSaa	If you can qualify for a new home loan while maintaining your current loan then you can do this.  Your agent does sound off their rocker.  You will close and move into the new home and then stop making payments on your current home.  The first home will go into foreclosure and if they do not bring the loan amount in when it goes to auction there will be a defeciency that will be a judgement against you.  But this judgement will not affect your second (new) home loan.  Home loans reflect very badly when they are defaulted on, but they are a secured debt and there is no debtors prison in the US which means you can have as many bad debts as you would like without worry of loosing your new home.      Now you may find that a bankruptcy would be useful after you do the home swap as they will often cut off your other lines of credit when your original home goes into default. The bankruptcy will not affect this new home and your choice to keep it either, you are entitled to retain your home regardless of how you went about getting it.  A bankruptcy will keep them from continuing harrassment and put an end to all debt so that you can positively rebuild your credit.    What troubles me most is that companies can forgive a debt larger than $300.00 and send you a 1099 that you have to claim on your taxes, if the mortgage company does this it could put you into a bad place with taxes. I believe this is nation wide, I live in Texas.    You should file a homestead exemption on the new home as soon as possible, you should be able to do this in closing, but you can only have one homestead exemption which will mean you will need to relenquish the one on your current home.  Homesteading the new house will provide further protection.    Tell the realator that you will be renting the home unless you can find someone standing in the shade that will help you with the whole situation.|`|EuUQuFnoaa	I don't know about that one Jay Jay.  Were that many people doing that that Bush had to make a law against it?  Wow    Best of luck with it all!|`|EWrHbTpmaa	jay jay i believe there was something passed to help home owners keep there home due to the housing probs here in so cali. see or contact your mortgage company if or what is available cuz im sure your upside down on your mortgage. this will help them from having yet another home on the sheets that will go to foreclosure stats even though you may not yet be late or bhind on a payment. i've heard of them moving you principal loan to the current value on the market but have not personally used this.  check with them first to document your options then talk about what you found with your hubby as u say.  u may be surprised that they may actually lower your payment so u stay in the property otherwise they just keep loosing $$.  and if you can save sum $$ maybe you can still live in your current house if the burden is lessened,  j|`|AA11173563	you can do just that but the loss on resale of the old home will get paid by you as to default on it with a new note in hand is not even discharged in bankruptcy. Now you will have to qualify for the new note with the other in hand and it will be viewed as investment property since they will be in the same general area and you will be required to put 20% down at a higher rate. So when the new house you think could be refinanced to a lower rate that will not happen for 4 years with a foreclosure and judgments for the default in your credit file. What you are doing constitutes fraud and you are not the first ones to try this and may not be the last   I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY
AA10305589	No, you need to include all your w-2s as they show your cumulative income.  The company needs to issue you another w-2 before you can file; they are legally obligated to provide this to you.|`|OYWTG9j6aa	they have to replace the W-2.  Call them again.

OacSIfSiaa	Well the official definition is what FACTA defines a credit score as:   A numerical value or categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default (and the numerical value or the categorization derived from such analysis may also be referred to as a risk predictor or risk score (FCRA 609(f)(2))    In simple terms it means a higher score = lower APR and easy credit.    Hope this answers your question.|`|C233ATPvaa	a credit score is how attractive you are out of 800 something.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	A credit score is a number that they give you to describe your credit worthiness.      There are three credit bureaus that you have a report with.  Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.    The score is between 350 and 850.  It can be different between all 3 bureaus.  It is calculated by your accounts, if they are current, if you ever made late payments, how long they have been open, balances in proportion to credit limits, whether or not you have collection accounts, civil judgmente, tax liens or bankruptcies.    The also list you name, addresses, employers, and other contact information.  Also, who has pulled your report and when.  This also affects credit score.    Most people are in the 600s.  A good score is anything over 700.  And over 800 is awsome.  I've only seen one person over 800 and I've seen alot of credit reports.  Anything below 600 is not so good.    Go to any of the credit bureaus websites to learn more about credit reports and scors.|`|1e8PFtgbaa	Check out www.myfico.com

So I'm worried that they'll go bankrupt.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	My career went belly up before the crisis.  I wish covers over the head and court TV shows paid the bills and taught my little boy right from wrong.      Get focused, don't listen to people who pop your bubble, actually quit talking to them altogether, poisin is poisin.     You know how to do it, you did it before.  Bummer that we have to start all over, beats walking half a day to get water and struggle for a bit of rice for dinner and sleep on dirt.    JUST DO IT.  Be grateful for the opportunity and your blessings.  Pick yourself up, look in the mirror, lose your naysayers, use your connections, and be you, you winner.  Examine the situation, the world, what do people need now that they are in perhaps a bit of a financial pinch.    Also, I hesitate,but if you went belly up unjustly, see if you can get a lawyer to take your case on continency.  A young hungry guy if your case is weak.  Strong case, go for the tried and true.law agencies.    If we are being honest with each other, I've gone belly up here and there and came out of it..  It's usually my fault, and introspective contemplation of how to grow from the experience is definately in order.  Hey, don't get mad at me, it takes work, and I so totally didn't make the rules,    Fix your issues or recognize them at least, unless it was a mass layoff, in that case, figure out why the other people doing your job DIDN'T get hit.  Purely as a self discovery exercise.  Have lunch with a survivor and sincerely ask for input...say "forget about feelings, I need to know"    Just some thoughts..I am only the world messenger, don't get mad at me.  I'm just trying to be helpful.|`|AA12116276	To be honest, I'm really angry right now and sick of looking for work. I also am tired of the way people react to you when you're struggling with your career. I don't want to hear positivity and/or suggestions/advice from people who haven't been where I am and/or don't know anything about my field or looking for a job in today's market. I don't want to be called lazy. I don't want to "talk about it, it will make you feel better" with people who are doing okay or better than okay. I don't want to see another rejection letter. I don't want to keep getting my hopes up about good-sounding jobs I apply to and then never hear anything. I don't want to read the kind of crap the at Cleo person above me writes. I don't want to open up to people who act like they care and want to support me, only to have them try to contradict everything I say or tell me what I "need" to do like my problems are so damn simple to solve and I'm too stupid to figure out these solutions. I'm tired of other people coming to me with their problems and expecting me to be sensitive and listen to them when they're insensitive and don't listen towards me. Frankly, I'm sick of all it, hate employers' guts and want to punch just about everyone I know in their mouths.     [Laughs] Sorry man...you did ask, though. None of this means I won't keep trying. I don't have any choice but to. I have loans, I'm getting close to 30 years old and live with parents who treat me like I'm 10. I'm venting to you because I know I won't get any of the above from you since you can't really respond to me in any way where I will see it. And I think that's the best way to deal--let it all out and then get back on the grind, trying to pick up the effed up pieces.

Visa and American Express make gift cards that can be used anywhere those credit cards are taken. Do not get a useless trophy. People will appreciate the gift cards or money. You could also give them a free day off with pay, they'd like that as well.    Also, there are online catalogs that let the employee choose a gift. I imagine the employer prepays a certain amount into the account, then there are lists of gifts the employees can choose from.
SKzOxZbYaa	The proper thing is err in the side of being overdressed.  Usually  black slacks are a safe choice, and then a simple button up shirt.  I wore that to my first interviews out of college, because suits can many times be out of your price range.   In general, it's a good idea to not wear too much makeup, not too much jewelry, and not wear anything too sexy.  Conservative and professional is the easiest way to go.|`|BpD01lccaa	Wear something dressy usually places like a polo shirt and khaki's.|`|GDTPhQHeaa	Can't go wrong with a suit!!

Invaluable as you grow up to learn as soon as possible.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|kAXWFW33aa	Skating Rink|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Culver's minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.

Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.      What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.    Try local grocery stores, pizza parlors, retail stores, fast food restaurants.

My suggestion would be to go ahead and sign up with the job corps, once you have been accepted, I would disclose that you are pregnant.

See if there is anything in their literature, or their website that might hint at not allowing pregnancy or any kind of leave within a certain time frame of hiring (as in the first year).  While they can't discriminate against pregnant women, they can say that the work may be too strenuous for someone in that condition, and that it will keep you from completing your promise to the program.       If the rules require that you commit to full-time, undivided time to your work for one year or more, then being pregnant may interfere with your fulfilling that commitment to the program.  There may also be penalties for not fulfilling your promise to the Corps, so be careful about signing up, until you have all the answers.|`|qikH4hPLaa	Have you considered working from home?

AA10283296	No, what you need is a job that will lead to a skill set and career.  Unless you plan on sucking off your mom forever.    Young adults with no experience do NOT find jobs online.  You need to pound the pavement and go out and put in applications and then go back two or three times a week to speak with the hiring manager until you bug him into giving you a chance.    You need to realize that there are MILLIONS of older people, with experience that are out trying to get these same jobs.    Times are tough and there is no end in sight.    Good luck|`|NZuJR79oaa	Well then you don't want a job.  The first step to getting a job is willing to work wherever is hiring.  Make a resume and include the work history of anything you have done, from mowing lawns to helping a friend put on a new roof, to snow shoveling.  Include references from people you have worked for.      Stop looking for jobs online and go to local businesses with copies of you're resume.  Most importantly be a man and grow up. You can work at McDonalds. Fast food chains have an average turnover of 3 to 6 months and are almost always hiring.  getting that job experience helps to get better jobs.  I worked at KFC for three years as a cook while going to college, I supported myself off of that job and now I make over $2K a week, in a job that hired me based on my work experience in fast food.|`|48oRO9lPaa	Your best bet is to just google "jobs"........    www.snagajob.com  www.monster.com  www.careerbuilder.com  www.craigslist.org (jobs)    Hope this gives you a start and Good Luck!|`|3fcRyGvnaa	go to actually stores and ask for an applications.    its great to see that a main need in your life is video games.|`|4gPpnZDEaa	You need to work on a decent resume, that is probably why you aren't getting call backs. Also if you walk in to a place that you want to work and ask to fill out an application, dress professionally, don't look like you just got out of bed,  dress like you are going to a semi-formal occasion (like church).  First impressions are the most important. if you look like a lazy bum, they will assume you are, even if you aren't.|`|3SwWwR4aaa	This is a very brunt answer.  You do not want to work at any fast food places because you are not hungry.  When you can no longer afford to pay the electric bill or when your stomach is empty, you WILL work at any job.........Believe this one truth from an old guy of 54 who has been around awhile.

968ul5Dvaa	Some people think musicians are dumb, and are just doing it because they couldn't succeed anywhere else. Not true. Musicians know what they're getting themselves into because it's tough from the very beginning. If they couldn't deal with it, they'd stop before they even finished writing their first song, so you know any musician who's made it big has pushed through a lot.     It takes a long time to be able to pay for your life as a musician. Just because a band or an artist got a record deal does not mean they're rich.     Musicians go into the music industry well aware of the risks, because it's what they love. They have a lot of passion and powerful ideas and want to share their work with the public. They searching for a connection, someone who can tell them they feel the same. And they love performing. It's all for the love of the craft. Ask any artist of any variety, and they'll all tell you life as an artist isn't easy. Not all musicians are looking for money. They know that's not always guaranteed. They just want to pursue what they love.|`|1SnI86BIaa	im not reading all that    but basically, cause they enjoy it  id rather work a job i enjoy getting paid less, than a job i HATE but get paid more

T6ZT3A57aa	When you make a proper business plan all of these matters will have been considered. Going into business is a major financial decision and it should not be done until you have thoroughly investigated whether or not what you have in mind is a viable proposition.    You will need to do much research before attempting this enterprise. The link below is one where you should be able to get help and guidance.     Remember that you will need to establish from your preliminary research that this will be a viable proposition.     The most important thing in any venture is a plan. You need to consider many aspects such as the type of business, whether you have sufficient skills needed, what are you trying to achieve and a host of other matters. If you are able to, have a look at pp101-102 in reference HSC Essentials Business Studies below. Alternatively, go to your nearest library and read as much as you can about a business plan. Far too many people rush into a business without first doing enough research to see if it is a viable proposition.     Which is better?     1. To have spent a few thousand doing this research, even if by the end this indicates that what you may have had in mind is not viable. or     2. To just go ahead, and then after spending all your money to find that that is still the case.    Ninety percent of all business that start today, will have have ceased operations ten years from now. Most of these will have closed because they ran out of money. Some fifty percent of the businesses will have shut down within the first two years - again as a result of cash flow problems. This is why planning is so crucial right from the start.    Seek advice, analyse it carefully, use those suggestions which you are satisfied are appropriate to your plans and beware of suggestions which look too good to be true. They most probably are!    Best wishes for success in whatever your finally choose to do.  Source(s):  http://www.sba.gov/

Pay some on the car, pay some on the charge cards, then stop using them for all expenses.  Use cash more frequently.  It is amazing how fast money goes when you use cash.  This is a good lesson for us all.  Don't forget to attend church, and bless God with some of your money, oh that should be done weekly with each paycheck, actually.

You may end up having to back owe them or something along that line, but I can't say for sure.  I think you may want to find out from the company your HSA is through to find out what to do w/ the tax respect of that.  I work in a pharmacy and people come in every day to get printouts for totals requested by the company.  Most of them look up what is and is not allowed on that sheet they send you of "allowed purchases" and USUALLY if they try to make one that isn't on the list, it won't allow the transaction to go through.  Like I said, it's just best to check with the company to find out how to handle it.|`|gyoylefvaa	RUN!    Well! what did you buy? if you buy something is not medicine you will be a big trouble.

I consider myself to be a hard worker, reliable and trustworthy and can provide references to verify this. I have included a copy of my CV which shows that I have the relevant experience for this type of work.    I have a passion for sales, especially working towards targets that will reflect upon wages. I am a very friendly, approachable and articulate person who can explain things clearly and concisely. I won a merit award at Morrisons plc for direct sales by setting up a sales area to sell perfumes and various other items which there were excess stock. I sold the entire stock within 2 days, using a direct sales method, engaging the customers in conversation and was commended with a bottle of wine from my general manager.     I hope my CV has been of interest to you. If you require any further information please contact me at the above address.    I would be able to attend an interview at your convenience and can make an immediate start.    HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|Cx9c6KrVaa	Do you have a separate CV? If not, you have no chance.    OK, next - spell check: "appling" sounds like something one might do in an orchard, "Microsoft Office" has a capital "O", and so on.    For each skill you mention in your covering letter, you need to be able to back this up in your CV. What presentation skills do you have? Have you presented at conferences? What's your degree in? Is it relevant?    What about your current retail job and your volunteer work has relevance to the job your applying for?     Otherwise, keep it short.
wqchA8B7aa	Yes, you need to file. You just do not get to claim yourself as a dependent. Go to H&R block or similar and have them file your taxes.    edit: Depending on how much you made and how much you paid, you may or may not get any money back. You may even need to pay in some extra money.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Yes, you have to file a return.  If they support you, they just get to claim the exemption for you instead of you claiming it on your return.|`|WUwdDxWMaa	yes you HAVE to file i didnt file last year and now i owe like 7000 dollors and yes you get money|`|7sMyItRDaa	yes you need to file and you could get some back  it depends on how much has been withheld. Do a 1040 EZ it is pretty self explanatory.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	If you make over $400 a year you have to file your taxes|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Yes, you have to file. Since your parents claim you, you won't get to claim yourself which means you don't get the $3500 exemption. However, its a lot more valuable for your parents to claim the exemption if they are in a higher tax bracket.     Since you are in school, look into the hope credit. If your parents are paying for your tuition they may take it instead of you, but if you pay for your own tuition, it might give you a bigger refund.    Whether or not you get a refund just depends on how much taxes were taken out of your paychecks throughout the year, and what your tax liability ends up being after deductions and credits.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	I believe you can still file taxes, you can check out the H&R Block website go to the calculator section and enter all your info in and it will tell you if you can expect to get anything back|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes you need to file -     You might see what the difference would be on your tax return and your parents return if they had let you claim yourself. If it get's you back a greater refund than what they get by claiming you, they may want to amend their return.|`|bOsV4O1Naa	yes. you make an income, thus you need to file taxes. The money you get back depends on several different factors.  I'm a college student, and my parents have claimed me before, and i was still required to file because I worked.  If you have student loans out and other assortments of things like donations, etc. will help in determining what you get back on taxes.  Always better to file and be safe than not file, end up owing money, and get in trouble for tax evasion or something like that.  I'm not too familiar with taxes either.|`|H1NjIT10aa	Yes you need to file.      Since your parents claim you as a dependent you can not take any deduction. So you will just have to figure your taxes on that bases and see what tax on $12,000.00 come to and then compare to what has already been paid into the IRS on your behalf.  If the amount already paid is more than what you owe, then yes you will get something back.

This is your mini emergency fund.    Step two:Debt Snowball for the win!!!! Once you've made necessities and minimums (IN THAT ORDER), use the remaining money (your disposable income) to attack the SMALLEST debt. Once you've paid it, it's psychologically comforting. Then continue to the next debt, and so on.    Step Three:$10-15k in your emergency fund. This is your fully funded emergency fund.    Step Four:Invest 15% of your pretax income into Roth IRA growth stock mutual funds. I recommend Vanguard. DO NOT USE A BROKER. buy the funds direct from the company.    Step Five:Save (if applicable) for the kids' college.    Step Six:Pay off (or buy with cash) the house.    Step Seven:reach the Pinnacle Point and build HUGE wealth. then give some away.    These are some good life steps.

This credit has to be REPAID at 0% interest over the next 15 years.      You would receive it when you receive your tax refund, there is a spot for it on the 1040 form.  You can also get the money early by changing your withholdings at work to reflect the credit.|`|pOFvmrQ5aa	I'm Dan I work for TurboTax -  If you qualify for the credit (Form 5405) you would get the credit back with your refund - I am assuming you buy before July 1, 2009 and elect to take the credit on your 2008 return.  FYI - the current credit would be repaid with your tax returns over the next 15 years.  However, the current stimulus bill in congress has some provisions to repeal the payment - don't know if that will be in the final bill that passes or not.    Daniel, TurboTax Analyst programmer

I respect and honor our veterans--my dad is a Korean War vet--and I think they should have excellent services and benefits, particularly when it comes to health-related issues, but we couldn't afford it if they could all get a tax card.  The difference would have to be made up by people who are already heavily burdered with taxes.  Edit:  Wartz, I think maybe he is talking about a tax number, used when businesses make purchases?  I don't think vets need to be able to buy TVs and beer and whatever without paying sales tax.  That's going a bit too far.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes - write your Congressman and let him/her know that all veterans need a no tax card. We've already paid our debt to the country.
HUlYUWpoaa	A legitimate modeling agency will not ask you to pay for classes or training. You do have to have photos which will run about $500.  Your agency will be able to give you some guidance on appropriate clothing and makeup etc. for the market that is available in the area where you live.  Check out www.modelmayheim.com you can join on line for free and check out the site.  You should ask parents first if its okay though.     Unless you live in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles you are not going to become a supermodel but that doesn't mean you can't make some money doing modeling either.     Also at age 14, your parents need to sign any contracts and you should be accompanied by an adult at any jobs.  It is not safe otherwise.     Most jobs are as print models meaning you would be paid an hourly rate for photos that are used in advertising or catalogs. Photographers and stylists on the job will help you with poses and studying magazine photos and going to fashion shows is a good place to learn for free.

NVIDmJpKaa	Hello Doll:     The purpose of a phone interview is to find out how you deal with people on the phone. They want to know if you are confident when taking calls, able to get your point across quickly, and if you're claiming to be bilingual, able to switch languages in mid-sentence if required.     I work with a Call Center that is undergoing some personnel changes. One of the things we look for is whether the person can express themselves appropriately in BOTH languages, while servicing an account.  Since you don't know who will be calling from one minute to the next, the requirement to be a quick thinker is absolutely essential.     Good phone manners, no slang in your English or other language is also required.  Speaking clearly, and above all, with a smile in your voice, will prove you're right for the job.  Being confident in introducing yourself with a smile, listening carefully to the other person, and providing clear, uncomplicated answers is always best.     Good luck with your interview.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	They just want to know if you really a bilingual and can handle other dialects of the spanish language, ie brazil, peru, Los angeles spanish, and so on.

When it comes to income there are some ways you can earn some cash:  1. Babysitting  2. Tutor  3. Getting a job if you're 16 and over.  4. Work at the school if there are any student related jobs.
AA10719605	Tell them you will settle for $200.00. State that is what you can afford and if they refuse, then you tried to pay the debt. It is $430 probably because of fees and interest. They will not sue you over $400 bucks. Offer to do monthly payments and request the payment plan in writing. If they refuse, then go online and dispute the charge stating the collection agency refuses to work with you. Then they are violating the law.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	You can send them a certified letter return receipt requested and tell them to not contact you by telephone.

Dividends are taxable, but there are different ways that they are taxed.|`|KXZm6rfRaa	You have to complete Schedule D for your total capital gains or losses for the year.    If you have a capital loss for the year, you can deduct as much as $3,000 each year against ordinary income.  The rest would be carried over to the next year.    Example:   In 2008 you lost $5,000 in the stock market.  You can deduct $3000 as a capital loss on your 2008 taxes.  Then on your 2009 taxes you can deduct the other $2,000.      The $2,000 is called a capital loss "carry forward".  You actually carry the loss forward to the next tax year.     So lets pretend you have a $2,000 "carry forward" and  lets say in 2009 you made $10,000 in the stock market.  You would take the capital loss "carry forward" and subtract it from your capital gain of $10,000 and report a capital gain of $8.000 for 2009.      You should go over your records carefully and determine the exact gain or loss from each transaction including commissions and report them on Schedule D.    If it gets to complicated for you then take them to a qualified tax preparer.      here is a link for more info: http://taxes.about.com/od/capitalgains/a...|`|SN5dYkafaa	Capital losses offset capital gains, dollar for dollar. To the extent your losses exceed your gains, you can deduct up to an additional $3,000 against ordinary income. Any capital losses not used in the current tax year can be carried forward, indefinitely, until used to offset gains/ordinary income in future years. Capital gains/losses are reported on your tax return, Schedule D.    If you have a simple return, you can efile for free using the TurboTax or TaxAct websites.

yAvOmQrkaa	A debt collector calling after 9 PM is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. First step is to ask the debt collector to stop calling so late.     If the debt collector will not stop calling after 9 PM, you should document the behavior and contact the Federal Trade Commission. You can submit your complaint online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov      You don't say what state the debt collector is in, but if you know which one, you can also file a complaint with that state's agency that regulates debt collectors.     Finally, you have the right to sue the debt collector in court. The debt collector has to have a long period of abuses, which you've documented thoroughly, in order to have a viable case in court. Hope it doesn't get to that for you though!    Regardless, you actually do have the right to tell the debt collector not to communicate with you in any way whatsoever. If you request them to do so, from that point on, the debt collector can only contact you to tell you they will no longer attempt to collect the debt, to let you know what are the usual steps they will take in the future, and to let you know that they will take those steps in the future. Often, this includes a lawsuit Really hope it doesn't go that far!|`|viGqMW1Xaa	telemarketers call my house at 11pm almost every other night disturbing my kids and family. i hate it.    i used to be a telemarketer and it was the worst job anyone could ever have. they have  a different time zone than you so when they call you around 9pm, it only 6 or 7 where they are. maybe even earlier.

AA11507759	Hosting in general for your needs is always fairly "cheap".  There is very high competition in the hosting industry so standard hosting packages are relatively low cost.  That being said you don't want the company itself to be "cheap".   Getting involved with a hosting company that is not well run and established can cause you weeks of headaches, lost data, and most importantly the loss of your time.  So look for price but look for quality as well.  You can find some tips what to look for in a website host and ways to avoid a bad company at http://www.hostingclickhere.com/index.ph...    As for your "blog" when you decide on a hosting package (linux would be my suggestion) you will have access to a "Control Panel".  Commonly referred to as Cpanel.     Cpanel is loaded with all the tools you need to administer your web server. Located in Cpanel is a program called Fantastico.   Fantastico allows a user to install programs with a push of a button.  In your case you could use this to install Word Press which is a free and very popular blog program.   You could literally have your blog up in less then 2 minutes.  Cpanel also has some installs for shopping cart systems, CMS (joomla - Drupal), newsletters and other similar software that maybe of value to you.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	There seems to be a lot that you don't like about accounting. My question to you is whether there is anything that you do like about accounting work? You might have more of a variety working at a small firm or if you started your own company. Corporate accounting may not be much different, depending on the type of company and your job description. The work could be more broad based than strictly audits, etc., The corporate side could offer a little different perspective for you. If you don't like accounting perhaps you should consider another career. Many people change careers, some more than once during their lifetime. Besides, there are other things you could do in business than accounting. I think the accounting background would be helpful for you no matter what you decided to do.
C7Mfo0soaa	This is untrue.  Houses heat up in the winter and sometimes you need to run the cooling mode.  If they needed to get the AC to turn on to check it, they could simply lower the thermostat so that it is not satisfied by the indoor temp.  Outside temperature has zero impact on the ability to diagnose a potential problem nor does it affect the systems performance in either heating or cooling modes.  Odds are they do not have a maintenance guy qualified to look into the problem(as in the case with many apartment complexes) and they don't want to hire outside help.  The service call alone should run them at least $100 and a repair or replacement will cost several hundred to a couple thousand dollars.  I would keep pushing the issue with them.|`|teOLv3h1aa	It can definitely be fixed when its cold out, however...why don't you just open the doors and windows? that would cool the house down immensely.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Just how cold is it outside? Is the AC unit specific to your apartment or part of a large complex. If it is for the entire building it may not be on yet and when to turn it on its just the fan kicking in. If it is specific to your apt do you have your own breaker box? if so see if the unit is even switched on, it will be a 220 volt breaker. if it is off turn the breaker on and wait 24 hours before turning the AC itself on, this is to separate the compressor oil from the refrigerant, if it is on already try switching it off and turning it back on, also go outside to the condenser and see if its uncovered and there may be a switch there also.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Their answer is total bull.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	You need to wait until you are at least 18 years old. But you don't need a credit card to build your credit. In fact, that is the last thing you need at your age. Credit cards are the main reason people get into trouble with their debts. Try thinking a different way about getting what you want. Save your money until you can pay cash. Most people spend more than they can afford if they use a credit or debit card. There is something about pulling the cash out of your pocket that encourages you to not spend as much. You will protect your good name by not getting into financial difficulty and you will save thousands of dollars on interest. People used to save their money and pay cash for what they wanted.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	sorry you must wait.  you don't want a credit card any way it gets you in serious trouble.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	u gotta wait|`|xj5KnGwEaa	You can get what I believe is now called a student visa, which requires your parents to co-sign the paperwork in their name since you're under 18.

The best thing to do is go to your local bank and talk to them about your options.

Ghx1XqSjaa	I had a simular questions that I asked a few days ago but to answer your question about filing the form electronically, hacer_ is correct, you do a form search Form 8379-Injured Spouse and it will allow you to file the form electronically. I tried filing my taxes last week but the form wasn't avaliable until the 30th. So, I filed my taxes on the 1st, which was sunday electronically with the injured spouse form.     The IRS states it takes up to 11 weeks to process electronically and up to 14 weeks if paper return.     As far as splitting the refund up and what amount is determined in the end result, I read that the IRS splist the credit equally as far as the children are concerned if it you live in a community property state and then you get what would have came from you from the git-go. So, let's say your refund would have been a certain amount based off of what you had paid in, then you would get that money back.      For me, I worked and my husband was out of a job all year we didn't qualify for any additional credits such as EIC but I assume what we do have is all my part because I basically supported the family. Even with the community property thing, it doesn't matter because it was all my income. So, if they wanted to be fair then I believe it would all come to me.     Good luck with your taxes, I hope everythings works in your favor!  Leaving out all of the baby momma drama with the child support issues! My husband pays child support to and I would be so mad if my refund was given to them.... =)      As far as the check format goes, you designate when you prepare your return if you want a check or a ach transaction. If you want it direct deposited then you need to put in your routing information and account number. It will also ask you if you are getting a check do you want it made out to the both of you or would you like in one person name since he not due a refund.

However, I would say that if you are electronically filing your income tax return then why are you not electronically filing your injured spouse form.  When we file a return with the injured spouse form we always electronically file the entire return including the injured spouse form.  If you mail your injured spouse form it will slow it down where as if you electronically file the injured spouse it will cut your time in at least half.    I hope that this information helps a little.|`|73c6084fbad1e11c3464ca98280bfa78aa	If you are married filing a joint return, then half of the income is considered his by the IRS.

I live in Texas and half was taken.  It took over six weeks to get my return and it was deposited to my account directly.  I also did my taxes on Turbo tax and I filed electronically.  I mailed the 8379 form separately.|`|OmC8rDGmaa	You file injured spouse forms electronically on turbotax or taxact or any other online tax software by doing a form search.  Usually there is a button that allows you to view or search all tax forms.  Just search for "injured spouse" and it should cue right up.  Fill out the form and when you print out your return before filing electronically it should print out with the rest of the form (you want to check that it's on there just to be sure, otherwise you will have to file the form separately, and that delays your refund even more).  Usually as you're filling out the form they'll ask whether you want the refund to be in your name, or in both parties' names.    If you requested an electronic refund, you will receive an electronic refund.  It is not different if you are an injured spouse.    I'm not sure what happens when you are the only one with income.  I have no personal experience with this.  Technically the IRS should only be taking money from your husband's taxes, since it's his debt.  I think what they'll do when they calculate it (they don't get specific about how they do that) is calculate your refund as if you had filed married filing separately.  But your guess is as good as mine.
AA10691226	Since they're free, why not?    Really, though, you need a new EIN because the tax liability is different.     Since a LLC is still a corporation, the initial EIN provided simply provides a credible source. It doesn't mean that the tax liabilities are exactly the same.    No two distinct legal entities should have the same EIN.

By the way, it doesn't cost $15,000 to repair an engine. You can buy a decent used car for much less. It it is the engine that has blown up then you can replace it with a newly rebuilt one for about $2,500-3,500. You could probably find a used car for less than $2,000.

eEjV0z0Vaa	Whatever the case may be, not filing your taxes has very serious consequences. You many hear about people who get away with cheating Uncle Sam for years, but sooner or later the IRS catches up to people who have not filed.     We've all heard the countless tales of people avoiding income tax whether they are political protestors to straight tax dodgers. Well-known tax evader Irwin Schiff has even written numerous books on the subject. But, beware, what these books never tell you are that failing to file your tax return can be more costly.     Tax evaders often face large criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as well as civil penalties. Take for example the case of the public accountant in Michigan sentences to five months in prison and five months of house arrest for failing to file tax returns for four, yes, four years. He also had to pay $140 thousand dollars worth of back taxes and $50 thousand in penalties and interest.    Offer in Compromise     If you qualify for an Offer in Compromise, the IRS will settle your unpaid tax accounts for less than the full amount of the balance due. This applies to all taxes, interest and penalties. Please note that a $150 application fee is charged when filing Form 656, Offer in Compromise. An Offer in Compromise is only considered after all other collection alternatives have been explored.    What if you receive a bill that you believe to be incorrect? You should immediately write or call the IRS office that sent you the bill, or visit your local IRS office. Make sure to have a copy of your bill handy, along with any records, tax returns, canceled checks, etc., that will help the IRS understand why you believe your bill is wrong.     One final note    Taxpayers should file all tax returns that are due, regardless of whether or not full payment can be made with the return. Taxpayers who continue to not file a required return and fail to respond to IRS requests for a return may face a variety of enforcement actions, including penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Not paying your taxes will warrant stiff penalties and interest, resulting in an ongoing, and very expensive, relationship with the IRS.

Look at Daschle they didn't go after him until they found out he owed over a hundred grand, then it was a slap on the wrist. I didn't file for a few years, then one year I just sent them a return and they sent me a refund.  If they owe you money believe me they're not going to say anything.|`|AA12029875	she will get letters in the mail a few times a year every year.  I don't know after that, cuz that's all that has happened to someone I know.  It's been for the last 6 years.|`|PHY2vd6baa	IRS comes and screws your life up....well really you screwed yourself up for not paying taxes.... damn commi|`|AA10481071	As long as you pay the HUGE fine,  there is no problem.    I would think he will need a lawyer once they catch it.  But he better start paying now,  so at least he won't get too far behind.|`|DIuE4vshaa	You go to jail.|`|OYWTG9j6aa	Depends on the circumstances and the amounts.  If he/she gets to them before they find him/her the chances are good that they can negotiate a smaller tax, but penalties will still pile up.      It is possible that this person never was required to file tax.      At the very least, get on the train with 2008 and hope they never find out.    Good luck, but give Obama his money...|`|TzVH5Pokaa	He will get in trouble!!!|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Most people get refunds and if that is the case with your friend  she could file them late  with only  a small late filing fee. Several years ago I filed  a year late and was charged only $5. However if she owes the government  money  she will have to pay interest and possibly a penalty. She will not get into any real trouble if she files late, but not filing  at all will eventually cause her  big trouble,    If she has lost things like w2 forms or 1099 she can get a duplicate and if  she as lost the paper work about most other things  she should just make her best guess about the numbers and dates, Unless she is audited she will not need to prove anything, and  even if she is audited and they disallow the deduction  the IRS does not consider it fraud or tax evasion to loose pieces of paper.    http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pd...
gW9dUa8Kaa	I get direct deposit every year from the IRS.. From my experience they always seem to deposit on Fridays.  If you don't see it on the 3rd I bet you will see it Friday the 6th!|`|q13DfiXEaa	I recieved my direct deposit 1/30/09, I called my bank at 3am / not there/ then called at 9 am and went shopping !!
Zs2lUCI4aa	You can get it in 2 or 4 years on associate or bachelor degree, make around $30K to 45K a year.    Must finish some prerequisite such as math, chemistry, biology..|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	My sister doesn't know exactly.   Ask at Triton or other CCs about an associates degree or a certificate.
l1VZkkOSaa	Probably at least three hours for each month of the year to sort that BS out. Please try to convince her that it's inappropriate to intermix personal and business accounts/expenses.  ---------------  Edit:  It actually may not be possible to sort all of that out correctly within a reasonable time-frame. Don't EVEN let her make you liable in any way for the accuracy of the financial statements you (can hopefully) produce. Business owners who have no grasp of fundamental accounting practices - should not be business owners.
