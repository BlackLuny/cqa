ALWAYS keep your flashlight on, since like the first one, this is a very dark game. I personally had more fun on the first, Condemned 2 seems too overdone to me, but it's a decent sequel none the less.

Unfortunately, you'll probably have to delete that save and start over again, so it's good you didn't get too far into the game. If you have Xbox LIVE, I'd recommend updating the game too, this could be a glitch that EA fixed in an update.|`|NRQbcT2Baa	Yeah you probably didnt do anything. This sometimes happens. Try signing into xbox live and updating the game and then try and restart the game and get past that spot and save. then try to load that game data.

TPqIYqWCaa	I actually have an iTouch  and use it with nike plus and Nikeplus.com for my running I also have a new nano that I got from my brother when he went to jail(tmi sry) anyway the touch is easier to use with nike plus you have to buy a sensor but makes running so much more fun and it only cost 20 both the touch and nano can use nikeplus so if is just for running and you would not use it any other time you should get nano but the touch has lots of apps to assist you in running and health nike plus is so cool check out the site|`|YoC5ksLkaa	it all depends on what else you plan to use your ipod for <br>  because both ipods are capable of both because of the solid state drive inside the ipod <br>  if your only need for and ipod is to go running then save your self the money and get the nano but if running is int the only thing you plan on using it for then get the ipod touch and the touch has a Nike running device that tracks how far you run and the touch has millions of apps and endless possibilities if you want to use it for running and other things get the touch|`|h33Mr9b1aa	You should totally get the Ipod Touch I have one and i love it!!!!!!! If you want to run with it there are cases to put it in and as big as the ipod are it will not get in the way of you're running,  I run with my Ipod Touch all the time.  And if you are going to get a case you should go to Best Buy they have a LARGE variety. And if you have the ipod plus nike, it is compatible with the ipod touch also, so that is great for all us runners!  Well anyways I hope this helps!|`|lrtZIeNIaa	now since you only really use it to run with, i suggest the nano...the ipod touch is really just sort of a novelty and is great for kids who want the iphone but can't handle the responsiblity....nano will be the best choice for running|`|d390d49f9d89511876e98c166876837faa	i have the ipod touch, and i think it's a great thing. you can get an app for pretty much anything, i"m not kidding either. also, i run with my ipod too. i just bought one of those armband things at the apple store and it works great :)|`|WnjjTvCPaa	IS THIS EVEN A REAL QUESTION?!<br>  <br>  of couuuuuuuuuuuuuurse you should get the touch! i have one and its like my best friend. no joke. and you cant get applications and games on the nano with the app store. and trust me those are super cool. haha. hope i helped(:|`|2WbR3IvFaa	Nano

WOiH4CGvaa	Yes you probably need a better antenna, or an amplifier. There's a thing called "digital cliff". Before, when and analogue signal was weak, you could still see the broadcast, but it might have been a bit fuzzy. Now with digital, it's either all or nothing!<br>  <br>  Here's one link, but just google "digital cliff" and you'll get tons more.<br>  <br>  The second link is to Antennaweb, it might help you resolve your issue.|`|akvrwpywaa	Because digital TV sucks (at least for air broadcast)|`|ebhu7ABvaa	Well the gov't is already in the process of getting rid of the 'over the air' signals. In a couple months, you won't be able to use your antenna. The digital transition. Sorry|`|9mS6rxWmaa	digital signal itself is small compared to an analog. It has a hard time going through people, buildings, etc, especially if you use the wrong type of antenna. HDTVs also have a hard time picking up signals as well, I have the same problems you do. Ok I bought a 80 dollar Terk amplified antenna for my HDTV downstairs *samsung 630* and still have to adjust a lot (I went through 4 different antennas). However my other HDTV *samsung 450* upstairs has no problems (less stuff impeding the antenna like cars, people, etc), the funny thing is that i'm using my oldschool rabit ears on it. YES YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD RABBIT EARS ON IT, in fact my old rabbit ears worked better than the stupid amplified hdtv Phillips antenna. The best solution is just to buy an outdoor antenna because almost nothing is in its way, I'm getting one soon. One day i'm just going to have to suck up to cable or dish and get their hd package for my hdtv lol.

56XwyVW9aa	I have a phone with them currently. This is what they do not tell you.<br>  <br>  One you will get the rebate, but you will have to wait 3-4 months to send in the rebate form.<br>  <br>  Two if you lose the rebate form then you can get one online. <br>  <br>  Three once you have the rebate form you will need to make sure you have kept your original box (CELL PHONE BOX) because they say they need a label off of it!<br>  <br>  I do not know why they need this since the bar code seems to be printed on the rebate form. I have called the customer service several times in the past few days and left my number for them to call me back. NO CALL BACK.<br>  <br>  Now as far as delivery, the phone came very quickly. If you have any problems with the phone, then Lets Talk refers you to the cell phone provider. Mine is US Cellular and they have been VERY helpful.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is I WOULD recommend getting the phone from them and making sure you keep the box and ask them about how the rebate policy works so you get your rebate. They to ld me they have to wait for the cell phone provider to pay them, so that is why we have to wait.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  Any questions, then feel free to email me and I can answer them or give you my cell number.

uctxzjIIaa	There aer two different 80GB models.<br>  <br>  The older one, which has 4 USB ports and came bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4 or Motorstorm, has some PS2 hardware and uses an emulator to handle the rest. It can play about 80% of PS2 games.<br>  <br>  The newer one, which only has 2 USB ports and doesn't come with a game, doesn't have any PS2 hardware and therefore cannot play PS2 games.|`|WPngT6IOaa	The 80 GB version uses software emulation for backwards compatibility.   It works with most games (I think Sony says around 95%).  So maybe you should try a couple different games to see if any of those work.  If not, you should contact Sony.

ebhu7ABvaa	I'd just call Samsung. Speak with a tech. The obvious answer, but trust me..it'll be quicker and more helpful. Too hard to tell what the problem is. You can try to hit reset in your settings. Or if there's a display button on your remote, hit that...it may take the 2 off.
oFcrglxzaa	how many milli amp (ma) hours are the batters rated? the higher the ma's the longer the battery will go, anything below 1000 is too low, the LCD screen burns up power so only use it when you have too and make it brief, the flash will also eat up batteries quickly, these are the two areas where you need focus on to conserve power|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Batteries are not rated in time of use, but in number of shots per charge, from 140 to over 1000, depending upon the camera design.<br>  <br>  Any time you use the flash, zoom or LCD, they will reduce the number of shots you can take.  Turning off the camera after each shooting session, will extend your batteries life
xG5ZlJDqaa	Yes it is totally normal. As previous people mentioned before, it is probably the IS (image stabalisation) feature. The lens also makes noise becausing of its autofocusing mechanism. The older lens that do not feature USM (built in autofocusing) in lens will require the camera to autofocus the lens instead, usually generating more noise.|`|tWoN22rRaa	If the lenses you own possess image stabilization (IS), and the feature is turned on, then they will produce some noise while taking a picture.|`|jYMUzFRzaa	Sounds like IS to me. Read the manual and learn how to use it properly.

StreamClip or HandBrake (whichever one you decided to get) and convert the video files to either wmv or avi format. when the conversion is complete, quit the converter application, launch MovieMaker and drag the converted file to the Collections area of MovieMaker.|`|W9IdT8zdaa	That's a shame because video making is great fun and very satisfying. I assume you have the 'Firewire' cable to connect your camera and computer?  It's good to have some simple video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Elements (there are many others) which allow you to edit the video, add titles and burn it to DVD, but first you have to solve the uploading problem. Some setting is obviously not right. Assuming you bought the camera from a store (preferably a camera store) - take it and your computer there and ask them to sort the problem for you. Another option - go online and see if there are any amateur movie-making clubs in your area.  They would be only too pleased to help, and you might even be encouraged to join the club.

xG5ZlJDqaa	Addressing your concerns first: live view is not really important unless you're doing a whole lot of macro photograpy (where you would other lie flat on your stomach with the viewfinder) Most of the live view systems implements in dslrs aren't really up to par to compacts anyway- having a slow frame rate, klunky performance, etc. Most pros don't care about live view. Megapixels don't mean a thing. Seriously. Unless you're shooting at below VGA resolution, the camera should be perfectly capable of printing out 4x6s. Read this: <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a><br>  <br>  On terms of other features, both cameras offer very similar performance that isn't worth mentioning on paper. Nikons are known for better ergonomics and menu system, which should be taken into consideration if you rather not fiddle around trying to look for what you want. The d40 is cheaper too, meaning you can spend more on lens, flash, accessories in the future if you ever consider upgrading.|`|YsltSuf2aa	I would say to go for the Nikon, you'll save money and it has great reviews. The Canon is more pricier. Plus since you're a starter for photography as a hobby, just choose something simple. If you want to continue to work with Photography and become more skilled then buy the canon when you're more experienced.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|xLuwji94aa	Go with the d40. Live View in the XS disables the Auto focus ability, and not many pros use live view anyway.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I would go with Nikon D40.|`|LVpyaf48aa	you can compare cameras at dpreview.com<br>  <br>  between canon and nikon it all comes down to what feels more comfortable in your hands and your opinion of which is easier and more functional to use... kinda like comparing mac and pc.|`|oFcrglxzaa	you will not see much of a difference between a 6 mp vs a 10 mp, the D40 is now almost under 400 and it comes with an 18-55 which is 28-90 and is very sharp, you will get 300 plus shots on a fully charged battery and the D40 takes nikon film lens too|`|i5OVORXgaa	I currently own the XTi which doesn't have liveview... and the only time I really wish I had it is when I'm shooting botanicals that are close to the ground.<br>  <br>  The D40 is a good starting camera. You may want to look into the Canon Rebel XT too.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes the good one id the nikon starter yes every body does the dlsr camrea is that but the best is canon|`|d55HYaktaa	A Nikon D40 with a SB-400 flash will be far better than the Canon XS.

And the answer is "no" you use the same amount of energy, where ever you plug something in.|`|s7Muujxzaa	How do you plug anything in to a stove?<br>  <br>  <br>  >Do you use more energy when you plug something into the wall<<br>  <br>  Depends what it is which you plug into the wall. If you plug an extension cord in, for example, and there is nothing connected to it, then no. If you plug a TV, as another example, into the wall, wouldn't it seem logical to you that it uses energy, since the TV generates heat?<br>  <br>  Have you ever taken a science class?

HBNx77BBaa	There's a recovery package that might help even if the computer is not seeing the card. I've used it to recover pictures from half-formatted cards that would not mount as drives. It's not freeware. The full version is $39.50 though you can download a free evaluation copy to see if it works and can find your pictures.    The software is BadCopy Pro, which you can get here...    http://www.jufsoft.com/badcopy/|`|LPCfOtiKaa	If you format your card you won't be able to get the pictures on it back so make sure you copy them first. Transfer your pictures from your camera onto a computer, then format your card.    Your computer can't read the SD eh?   Then you'll have to put the pictures on a different computer or simply buy a second memory card.

FsPBIZOqaa	iPod can only support mpeg4 video,so you must make sure the video is mp4 format ,you need to have a 3rd party tool to help you to convert dvds and video into mp4 or h264 format, add them into itunes library, then sync to ipod.    Try Cucusoft ipod video converter,it support convert video to iPod directly. Some other software need two steps: 1. convert video to avi; 2. convert output avi to iPod.

D68IdfMZaa	virgin mobile is tough, as their phones only allow the mp3 ringtones to be used as Sounds. You can actually use Ventones, to make the ringtones for FREE from music files. <br>  <br>  www.ventones.com<br>  <br>  Its my favorite site with the best FREE online ringtone maker. <br>  <br>  But then you'll have to put a little work, time and research and find out how to load the ringtone from ventones on your phone. With a little know how you can download the ringtone, and then use a cable<br>   to load it on. You might to search and install drivers for your pc to recognize your phone's file system. Anything is doable.|`|w7Ffw6MYaa	Sorry, but Virgin Mobile disables any way possible to get free ringtones. I have tried many ways, and had no success. I own several Virgin Mobile phones, and its not possible on any of the Virgin Mobile phones (including the Tnt). My suggestion is to try Jamster, its $9.99 per month, but you save a lot of money. For $10 per month, you get 7 wallpapers and 6 ringtones. If you bought them separately from Virgin Mobile, it would cost you about $29. So you are saving $19 from Jamster, once you subscribe for a month, you can cancel before another month comes up. P.S- I am not advertising, just helping :-) Click the link below if you want to join Jamster. <br>  <a href="http://www.jamster.com/jow/register/start.do?groupname=&jhs=3282&forcelocale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamster.com/jow/register/star...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)

X9BuVltFaa	The format of the songs on bearshare are not compatible with any ipod. itunes does not work on my computer so i download songs from limewire(free to downlaod and download songs) then put them into media monkey (to edit song info and put on ipod). You can do almost the same things as you can on itunes wtih media monkey except put photos and videos on ipod (they might change that though but right now you cant)|`|ElvQTpUVaa	First mistakke - Bearshare.  Better p2p options are WinMX and eMule.    2nd - you've made it unreasonably difficult to solve your problem because like many hear, you prefer to say what you can't do (and not very specifically either) instead of what happens when you try to do something.    In short, if you've downloaded unprotected mp3 files, there's no reason that iTunes shouldn't put them on your iPod.    Please edit this question to indicate what you did and what happened.
1ayX5jmsaa	no there is not, you might want to just check around the room, under the bed and in between the bed and the board/wall. maybe check the dirty laundry
AA10929359	Ok, What you ask is a fantasy, First of all you have to realize that the iphone needs itunes, it is Itunes the program that controls everything that goes inside and outside.    However I just found a Glitch, you see I have a Cyber Cafe and 2 customers came with theirs and ask me if I could upgrade their itouchs.    Since I have a Credit Card and I know that the first generation needs a 10 dollar update so you could have mail, I accepted the challenge, I must say that Itunes is very dificult to learn to use compared to the drag and drop of other mp3s,     So there I was trying to update, but one of the iPODs was death, I mean death, no battery no nothing, so I recharge the battery and if you press the Hold button and the Home button for about 5 seconds it formats itself.    Of course you need Itunes to reload the O.S. but when it does, it upgrades itself (FOR FREE).    So once is uploaded now youll have Mail and the App Store wich is great.    One thing to mention is that there is no way you could check your HOtmail email on the iphone unless you pay 20 dollars to Microsoft. So if you have Yahoo mail, just fill in the blanks and your are all set to go.    If you are a more demanding Tecnology user you might want to check out their Mobile Me service ....I JUST LOVE IT     Good Luck my Friend.

Feels tough and actually really stylish as you would expect with the apple products...    9.5/10 rating     0.5 off for having to use itunes only... but it isnt that much of a problem at all
3yvuMkzTaa	I doubt you can port a number, when you owe the carrier. In order to port, your contract has to be over, or terminated, & the number has to be clear!!!

6sw414iqaa	Predictions? This is the right word since nobody even knows if the digital SLR of that name is actually existing. Rumors abound leading to a possible launch during March 2009 PMA fair.    However, consider that this is still unconfirmed. To get an idea of what kind of status this has, I'd suggest that you go to http://ylovephoto.com/en/2009/02/07/comp...    Next, comes the concern about when -after the possible launch- this camera could really become available (go into production). It seems that Nikon does not usually take a long time after launch to make its SLR cameras available. Probably within 1 month (at most 2 months). Canon seems to be a tad bit faster, though.|`|7Y4fv3g9aa	November 2009.

AA11629848	That's because they don't do the mixing in the same way as Networks do for their shows. After 10 min. of the same equalized and sometimes dull program advertisers want to draw your attention, therefore a raise on sound volume, as most commercials are filmed with "movie theater" sound in mind. Also, if the commercial is done by a local "shop", inexperienced in Network settings and protocols it can go 3 or 4X louder, just to be noticed over other commercials, try to watch a local TV channel at 2:00 AM without nobody noticing, it's impossible. <br>  <br>  The loudest of all are the Hispanic Networks like Univision and Telemundo.

gfiTCFTeaa	well, do you have an ipod?<br>  and honestly, ipod touches are amazing.<br>  they do almost everything.<br>  wifi: youtube, websites, myspace, facebook<br>  music<br>  movies<br>  music videos<br>  games tons of amazing ones.<br>  tons and tons more.<br>  you can even find directions to places.<br>  find places to eat around you.<br>  tons and tons moreeeee!<br>  you don't know what you're missing mr. sir. <br>  and i don't 'whip out my player constantly just to change songs'<br>  i like it put it on shuffle. :)<br>  i don't need anything smaller, i like everything about the ipod touch.<br>  and anyways, the iphone is pretty much the same thing, just more advanced, and if i wanted an iphone, i'd have to switch plans. i've got uscellular, and i don't wanna switch to at&t cause it would be more expensive. so yeahhh....i'll stay with the ipod touch.... and you do whatever the heck you want. :) cause if you don't like this amazingggg divice, then why are you telling people how crappy it is? you didn't have to tell us, because we all know it's perfect. :))|`|NeS9v0kfaa	ok first the iphone is great but its alot "bulkier" and mor expesive and with any mp3 player your gonna have to take it out to "change the song". and the touch screen is great for games. so yea what know muchacho?|`|9oJ60QbKaa	personally, i got it because i loved the games. i already have a phone so i didnt need the iphone. I have an ipod nano for when im jus walking around so i dont have some bulky thing in my pocket, but when im like on long trips its nice to have that so i can play games or even surf the web without pulling out my laptop. But yea i love games and the graphics on the ipod touch are crazy so yea :) plus i like the high tech look of the main menu.|`|YT1vOwq6aa	cuase all the cool features on the touch make it worth it.<br>  Also, its not bulky, its big, but its rather slim.<br>  With all those new apps, you can have plenty of fun.<br>  Why would i want something smaller, if it only holds music, and the movie sucks cuz the screen isn't that big?<br>  <br>  People have their opinions man, this is mine.|`|dqEZOyexaa	Smart one the reason why soeone would get an iPod touch over an iPhone is because they don't have AT&T or they don't want to pay a monthly bill.. With an iPod you can also make playists so u don't always have to take it out ur pocket.. So don't talk **** when u don't know nothin
dqEZOyexaa	If u bought it for 150 the return price would be about 100- 125 so ur pretty safe but carry about an extra 10 just incase|`|RFCsTwF0aa	sell it on ebay and use the money on ur new one|`|XMXtXDbbaa	no you need about 100 $$$$$ more

It'll keep all the songs on there and then when you plug in your ipod and go to itunes it will automatically(in most cases) sync all the songs to your ipod.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps (:|`|GuDHZzBAaa	nope nothing will get deleted dont worry about it just sync the songs onto your ipod.|`|hccNQ4Lqaa	Nope they wont be deleted. They will just sync to your new ipod.<br>  <br>  <br>  ENJOY!|`|4P3CMim8aa	no|`|9auKzop0aa	No, they will not be deleted, probably off your old iPod the next time it's connected, but not your new one.. It will sync to new one as soon as you register it to iTunes.|`|mVN9uAbVaa	No. They will stay. You can easily delete them from your old iPod once you set up your new one, in case you wanna get rid of the old one, but all your songs will stay in both your old iPod and your iTunes.

The reason Apple offers that for free is because they don't want people selling there iPods they want people to buy them new from them. Like no one wants to buy an iPod marked "LaFondas iTouch!!!

N4IvZmPiaa	You've got a great camera there in the D300. Don't cripple it with cheap glass! Put that money towards a good fast Nikon lens. Stay away from the Sigma's and Tamron's. For the type of photography you are doing, I would grab a nice 50mm AF-S f1.4 Nikon lens for about $500.00. Or if you wanted to kick in an extra $200 bucks or so on top of what your very generous wife gave you, I would highly recommend the F1.4 85mm which is about $1000 U.S....This is an OUTSTANDING piece of glass!<br>  <br>   Don't forget, the lens is what sees the subject and gets that information to the camera sensor. If you have cheap glass, it's garbage in-garbage out! You will be much happier with the quality of your model shoots with one of those two lenses than any of the lenses you listed...|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I would go with 18-200mm.Great all around lens .Sharp, crisp pictures with vibrant colors <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY52NU?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000BY52NU" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY5...</a>|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	18-200mm The best "vacation lens" of the five listed. Pretty good value considering its reach too. However, the lens suffers from more pronounced geometric distortion than the other lenses here. <br>  <br>  18-135mm Excellent sharpness at all focal lengths and apertures. Suffers from pronounced chromatic abberation and distortion, however. Consider the similarily priced 18-105mm that performs better for chromatic abberation and also implements a VR system.<br>  <br>  24-120mm From the reviews I have seen, avoid this lens altogether. It is too soft at all apertures, even when closed down.<br>  <br>  24-85mm Not sure about this lens. Sounds great though.<br>  <br>  70-300mm A great lens if you're not ready to spend a grand on the 70-200mm f/2.8 A little soft at the telephoto end, but still perfectly usable. Distortion is well controlled.<br>  <br>  Other lens to consider: Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AF-D, Nikkor 85mm f/1.4 AI-s (manual focus, used only), Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 micro, Sigma 150mm f/2.8 macro, Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8, just some of the great lens that are out there.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	I would go with a fast constant aperture lens in 60mm range. The Nikkor AF-s 60mm F2.8 micro ($509) would be great for portraits. It will also function as a true macro lens with 1:1 magnification. Traditionally portrait lengths were 85-105mm with film or full frame cameras. Because of the crop factor of the D300 the 60mm performs like a 90mm lens would. Thus giving you the ideal focal length for portraits. Prime lenses tend to be much sharper and faster than zooms as well. The wide aperture will give you nice Bokeh or shallow depth of field that some of the other lenses will not.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/545660-USA/Nikon_2177_AF_S_Micro_Nikkor_60mm_f_2_8G.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/54...</a>|`|VYjbGbGJaa	From the list that you gave, I would pick the Nikon 18-200 VR lens. Its a DX lens that will mate perfectly with your D300. It also has a super close focusing distance and can work as a telemacro. Price is great, and its not too heavy. The only other lenses I would get would be professional Nikon glass, f2.8 or faster.|`|i5OVORXgaa	The perfect focal length for portraiture on a full frame is 70-135mm. Your D300 has a crop factor of 1.5X... so you'll want something that is between 46-90mm. The 18-200mm, 18-135mm, and 24-120mm will all work great for you... I recommend you get the 18-200mm though.|`|xLuwji94aa	I would not recommend the 18-200, because of the distortion, or light falloff (at least on my sample) or the 24-120, because it is overpriced for it's lackluster performance. Trust me, I've owned both, and sold both soon after.<br>  <br>  I'd personally recommend the AF-S 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G, It balances perfectly on my d90, (and is a tad heavy on my other camera - the d60) so it would feel underweight on a d300. If you must have total weather-sealing (you pointed out that you do beach scenes) the 24-70mm is one of two Nikon lenses that have it (and is cheaper than you think, but still a few hundred above your $800.00)|`|YsltSuf2aa	You're wife supports you taking pictures of female models in bikinis?<br>  Your wife must really love you.<br>  Power to the people.

pOi0wewIaa	Yes|`|d381leKpaa	YES. But it! you'll be able to get 1080p for sure, as long as you get HDMI cords. I don't have all the pro's and con's of the console, but here's a comparison between the 360 and the PS3, and you can glean a few facts from that.. hope i help tho, also... $100 price drop in april, i'll post the link<br>  <br>  For One, the PS3 will last the longest for the next gen consoles that are out now:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 was made in 2005, they've already made a different version of it (Elite) so soon they'll have the next 360, more likely the 720, probably in 2010-2012 that's not very long 1-3 years of play<br>  Wii- was poorly designed in 2006. They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.<br>  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.<br>  <br>  The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.<br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.<br>  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.<br>  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)<br>  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser, just like a PC's<br>  <br>  On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Total: $415<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Xbox Live $80<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $660<br>  <br>  As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|VcNHahtgaa	Right now, Best Buy is selling PS3's for $399, with a FREE $50 Gift Card meaning they are giving you free $50 AND your choice of a FREE Guitar Hero 3 or Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

But when I checked my voicemail with another phone, the same thing happened, so I believe its service related.<br>  <br>  Update:<br>  <br>  I contacted T-Mobile.

Your best bet and best bang for your buck would probably have to be the Blackberry Bold,|`|0VUg2Cy6aa	I'd say voyager. It has a touch screen in the front so I guess that kind of takes care of the iphone situation. Also you can open it up and it has a full qwerty keyboard and a second screen.

If you dont, just watch one of this guys videos. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Dinozambas" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/Dinozambas</a> He has a lot of different jailbreaking videos. Once jailbroken, (and nothing bad went wrong) you can go into cydia and find some of them.

QueLLNiraa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Well it depends on you, do you prefer just listening to music with few games and programs OR do you prefer having access to the internet, countless touch pad games, GPS tracking and hundreds of other software?<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer both of them in a different way - of course I prefer the iPod touch better. But with the iPod touch you can't change songs without taking it out and pressing on the touch screen which I hate.<br>  I like the nano because it's alot cheaper, just plays music and you can easily skip to the next song by pressing the button.<br>  <br>  Both of them could get stolen, so be careful, jealous people prefer the iTouches so that's why alot of them gets stolen and it isn't that easy carrying around.<br>  <br>  iTouches also have crappy speakers which the nano doesn't.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	Because of the whole bus thing, I'd say get the Nano.

YlyN73Jnaa	If you love to play games, then buy an ipod touch. If you love to listen to music and songs, then buy an ipod nano 4th generation. You should be more responsible and keep track of your belongings next time.

rJ8kLGgkaa	EBay is the best in terms of the most stuff.  But you have to be careful not to make your offer too high or you can end up paying more than retail.  Newegg.com frequently has significantly discounted prices for new stuff, a great return policy, and user comments on lots of items so you don't get stuck.  <br>  <br>  Craigslist is good because there is a posted price, so you won't get into a bidding war.  But a lot of people won't ship, so you have to go get the item.  <br>  <br>  Also, watch out on EBay for refurbished items, or make sure they have a factory warranty.  There is also uniqueauction.com, onsale.com, and auctionbidmart.com.  Always be sure to use PayPal to pay.  Never give your credit card number, use money transfer, or Western Union.  Too frequently, people list bogus items on auction sites so they can get your credit card number.  <br>  <br>  Remember to read the warranty, because many items don't have warranties.  And always factor into price you offer the fact that you will be paying shipping at least two ways and maybe three ways if you have to return the item for replacement.<br>  <br>  Answering this isn't really that easy!!|`|WqIbk1Fzaa	backpage.com<br>  <br>  Get real quality traffic to your site<br>  we can post your ads to all the main classified sites<br>  www.baridows.info

7rnlYVu4aa	Yes if it is an imported psp from japan the UMD's (cd's) will be region locked. If you plan on just downloading videos from your computer you can. For the games yes as long as they are from the PlayStation store online. There is no difference in the colors, only the series of the psp. All psps play: music, videos, view picture, internet browser, games, internet radio. If you wanted to buy the mint color for its looks alone its fine, but buying a black, silver from the US will save you the trouble about worrying if the UMD's games will work. The price of a new one is $169.99 slim(2000), OR for the 3000(brite) but its also unhackable at the moment.|`|q6uyloYdaa	If you download them it should be fine. The UMD movies are region locked by continent, which is why you can't play them. The games will work, though.

EePcxbRyaa	first, (if you havent tried already) reset the ipod by pressing the menu and middle button and try syncing it to your computer again.. if that doesnt work, then plug your ipod in your computer and when itunes pops up go to your ipod on the left part of the itunes window.. then click it then under the "general" tab (or the first tab if its not called general) and click "restore ipod" and then after it resets your ipod then it should work.. if it doesnt, uninstall itunes and re install it just to be sure and if none of this works, go to apple and request to send your ipod in and they should fix it.. hope i helped

Keep in mind, too, that you can pay more for a tripod than many people pay for their camcorders, if you're serious about "best". <br>  <br>  My favorite brand is Manfrotto.

Hold the white button on the front of the console next to the power button down until the green ring of light around the power button flashes and spins around. Then hold the little white button on the top of his controller down until the ring of light on the controller flashes and spins too. After each has flashed a few times, the controller will sync to your console. If you plan of using your controller at the same time, make sure you turn yours on first before syncing his. The top right corner on the ring of light on your console will fill in and that matching section will fill in on his controller. Yours will be the top left section.

298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	It means that iTunes cannot find the song files on your computer. When you add music to iTunes, it will look for the music (when playing, editing or loading the songs to your iPod) in the location from which it was added. If you either move the files or delete them, iTunes will not be able to find the files; it won't know to look elsewhere for the file. The easiest and quickest thing to do would be to delete the songs with the exclamation point next to them and re-add them to your library (given that the files are still on your computer). iTunes also gives you the option to "find" the files. If you either try to play the songs or edit them, you will get an error message that also gives you the option to find the file. Click yes, and browse through your computer's folders to find the file. This method can be tedious, however, since it has to be done song-by-song.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	they are there because itunes cannot find the original path to the song.  I'd just delete the song and try downloading and transferring again. for me, that solves the problem.|`|2tqdTCPQaa	slow down lol one question at a time....first of all the exclamation mark means the song is failed and that it cant be found in your computer...i have found out with having an ipod it is better to use one computer system with your ipod...because when you dont then if you try to sync it to another itunes other then the one you have then you have to resync it....that is a result of having to delete the songs already on it....you have to have the song in your computer system for it to play not just in itunes or on your ipod...hope i helped|`|8myga9p7aa	The ! means that iTunes can't locate the file that is the song, and therefore can't do anything with it.  This happens if you've moved or deleted the file or told iTunes to look in a different place for your music.  If you re-import the songs, that should fix it.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	the exlamation mark means the song can't be found. download it again. <br>  <br>  in options or preferences for ipod, make sure auto sync is turned off and manual is checked.|`|d7c2c0eb976d14052f23033de5a231c4aa	it means that itunes can no longer locate or find the file for your song- try to locate it and then tell itunes to use it|`|5HOyupgfaa	you normally only get the ! next to songs you downloaded from other sites, and it means itunes cannot find the mp3 file. i would try deleting the song from itunes and the mp3 file and redownload it|`|CfK8ncdZaa	It means that the song is defective, or it might not be able to find the original file that the song was on. <br>  <br>  yeah you're going to have to delete those.. thats what i had to do
p3rnyBoYaa	I just received a phillips as well. I plugged the mp3 into the laptop and then used explorer to access the music directory and then deleted the music file like any other file.<br>  <br>  When you are done and unhook the mp3 it will update.|`|eid6iT4Raa	plug it into your computer and open windows media player and edit your songs.
73t6LfrDaa	Currently, there is no mod chip designed for the PS3 to play backup copies of games. I haven't seen any news on the forums or news-boards of major mod-chip producers, however, that doesn't mean they aren't working on something.<br>  <br>  As a note, if / when they do mod the PS3, whether it be via a chip or a firmware upgrade, PS3 games are burned to Blu-Ray disks because of the amount of data they can store and the quality of the video being played. This means you will need to get a Blu-Ray burner as well as blank dual-layer Blu-Ray disks which currently run at around $30 per blank disk.|`|Q9zuGETAaa	The PS3 is a nightmare for hackers due to the security measures Sony took. And Homebrewers don't really care anything about messing with it since you can install Linux on it and have any features you want without much work at all.<br>  <br>  As it is, you can't play burned games on the PS3, and you likely won't be able to for a very long time (if ever).|`|A6OYBsusaa	all you need is a BlueRay burner and blank BlueRay discs and you can have play them without moding your ps3 or even opening it.

8c0VNPOFaa	You have to wait till you are prompted to put the blank disk in.<br>  whats happening is you haven't recorded to the disk yet.<br>  Be sure to select the SAME DRIVE, copy to the same drive,then the dvd cloner will prompt you to insert the disk. When you insert both disks at once first the DVD cloner copy's the DVD to a temp file then it copy's the temp file to the new dvd. Its likely that you put both disks in at once then when the first disk was ejected you assumed that recording was finished. Actually the process was only 1/2 done....<br>  there is no difference between dvd-r and dvd+r both are 4.7 gb disks both read as full when put in while empty....if the disk shows 4.7gb full then it is blank! only when it shows the actual file size is it recorded to! this is because windows cannot copy directly to a dvd..thus as far as windows is concerned the disk is full....LOOK ITS TOUGH AND TIME CONSUMING BUT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION YOU CAN DO IT!|`|mH4Duumxaa	o no. the world is gonna end!

(This will take a few seconds for the logo to appear) If this doesn't work you can try resetting the iPod, which can be done by clicking on your iPod in the iTunes sidebar and then clicking on restore iPod. (This will erase all of the data and reinstall the software on the iPod) Lastly, if all of the doesn't work, you can make an appointment at an Apple Store (if you live near one, or else you can call Apple Care and send you iPod in to be repaired)

TbTO5SXlaa	Lets review.<br>  <br>  Kodak introduced its Portra line of color print film in 2006 (Portra ISO 160NC and 160VC and ISO 400NC and 400VC - Natural Color, Vivid Color). Since then, Kodak has improved it to produce even finer grain at ISO 160 and 400. It is readily available in 35mm or 120/220 rolls.<br>  <br>  In 2007, Fuji re-introduced its Velvia ISO 50 color slide film. Its available in 35mm, 120/220 rolls and 4x5 sheets.<br>  <br>  In 2008, Kodak introduced Ektar ISO 100 color print film. Since the 35mm size has been so popular they are going to release it in 120.<br>  <br>  Obviously, Kodak and Fuji have invested in new films so they must see a market for them. <br>  <br>  Its easy to understand how youngsters who've never known anything except digital photography think film is a dying entity.<br>  <br>  At the Tokyo 2008 Used Camera Show, attendance by 20-somethings was up considerably over 2007. <br>  <br>  High schools and colleges that ripped out their traditional wet darkrooms a few years ago are now putting them back. This is a result of both student and instructor demands.<br>  <br>  Fuji, in full-page magazine ads, is promoting its film with micro profiles of working pros who are using Fujicolor and Fujichrome.<br>  <br>  So ignore those who think you're out of touch and don't worry about running out of film any time soon.|`|s1OjeSffaa	No,,,,,,,,,,,,,film will always be here to stay! What will go will be the 35mm format..........the other professional films will be around  a while.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	The truth of the matter is that yes, sooner or later (probably sooner), film will become just a novelty in photography.  Despite the fact that film gives a truer, clearer picture than digital photography, its also more expensive and bothersome to work with.  I don't think it will fall out of major use for maybe 50 years or so, but it is inevitable, much like the DVD's triumph over VHS.|`|jqmwkGvYaa	The megapixel equivalent of film is still much higher than digital. So, until digital reaches that point, there is still an advantage to using film, not to mention all of the things that you can do in the darkroom.

But there is a rumor that they are coming out with a bigger screen this year.

I think this is gonna happen because its such a popular ipod. I have an ipod touch myself & its the best ipod ive had (ive had almost every type of ipod) you can do sooo many things with it & the battery life is great .|`|IY9JolQ4aa	If you get an itouch you'll love it so much that color won't matter. Plus, you'll want a case for it when you get it so you wont even see the actual color of the ipod. Ipod is by far the best MP3 player ever and i would never buy anything but an Ipod!!! I'm a 6 year ipod veteran and i swear by all the ipods i've had!!!|`|q4Qe8UdNaa	not anytime soon, they usually release the new ipod models every year around september, i guess you'll just have to wait and see
H9Bzw0VNaa	I did it a couple months ago, and had WAYYY too many problems with it.  IMO not worth it.  It has a few little "cool" gadgets and stuff you can put on it, but its only interesting for the first day.  I like it better non-jailbroken.  If you're still undecided, you should do it and see how you like it... You can always restore it back which is nice :)|`|z88IMXNFaa	No.  Like you, I haven't seen anything that makes me want to jailbreak it.|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	Do it if you have a reason to, otherwise don't bother. <br>  <br>  The point of "jailbreaking" is to break the chroot "jail" and be able to access the filesystem of the iphone all the way up to root. People do this to install third-party apps and whatnot. <br>  <br>  If you're not installing anything, don't jailbreak your iphone, as it voids the warranty and makes things pretty difficult should you ever have to take it in for servicing.|`|KH0RGuVwaa	NO you should not. If it doesnt seem that great to you then just dont do it. If there is ever a problem with it, Apple may not support you, neither would AT&T because it is jailbroken and they would say the problem(s) is your fault.<br>  So no i wouldnt do it, cause you never know what will happen to your iPhone because of it.
OGYw2y7Jaa	All you have to do is wait for a long time untill unless its battery gets over and it switches off automatically and then you can put it for charging and then you have it done it is on.<br>  Even I have experienced this quite a lot of times but frequent switch offs like this can spoil your ipod forever this is what apple says.<br>  The reason for it if the iPod shakes or vibrates with a great force or it falls down then it happens.  <br>  <br>  Hope you can this helps you.<br>  <br>  KBK|`|g5PdKsA5aa	well it would depend on wat kind of ipod u have but i would guess that it froze... try toggling the lock button and stuff. or u could just try the 5 r's: <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/five_rs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/five_r...</a>|`|TtMKPBR3aa	you need to reset it|`|RlCKkyvJaa	If your ipod has frozen, have you tried reseting it?<br>  All you have to do is    <br>  1.  Toggle the Hold switch on and off. (Slide it to Hold, then turn it off again.)<br>  2. Press and hold the Menu and Center (Select) buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 8 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.<br>  <br>  <br>  If when you plug it into the computer and nothing pops up, try plugging it into another USB port on your computer.|`|57cIPjSVaa	there's probably something wrong with the cord. try to see if you can borrow a cord from someone else and plug yours in using that one. if it works then it's the cord. otherwise the actual ipod's probably broken.<br>  <br>  or try resetting it.<br>  <br>  if it's broken i'd suggest getting a zune...they're cheaper and work soo much better! (at least in my experience. i went through two ipods in 1.5 years because they stopped working...i've had my zune for 2 years and LOVE it!)|`|x3OnQn25aa	that happened to me just yesterday, did you tried pressing menu and the center button? <br>  <br>  if not, maybe you should check the cable. when my ipod didn't wanted to charge i conected it in another PC and it worked there,you could try that too.|`|2hcgJW8eaa	Try holding the hold switch as well as the home button for 20 seconds. Keep trying to do this

Q9zuGETAaa	You need a 2.5" (Laptop/Notebook) SATA hard drive.<br>  <br>  Speed doesn't matter as long as you get 5400RPM or 7200RPM. The PS3 doesn't make use of the extra speed of a 7200RPM drive, but they may change that with a system update.<br>  <br>  It will make use of extra cache though, so if you have the option going with 16MB cache instead of 8MB cache, you may want to go for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Amazon will have some.

File Sharing is still OK that's why the BitTorrent and LimeWire websites are not shutting down.<br>  <br>  However, if you SELL mp3 without license to do it, then that's illegal. If you distribute copyrighted files without the right license, then that's also illegal.

fh8bQdGkaa	Heya, it's a little mainstream, but the ipod shuffle would be great for you! They are tiny, inexpensive (starting at only $50), and can hold quite a bit of music. They can clip onto any part of your clothes, or just fit in your pocket. It's about the size of two bottle caps, so it can fit in the palm of your hand easily. There is no screen, thus more battery life. It also has an LED battery life indicator! The only thing about them is that it's called "shuffle" for a reason... haha. You have to listen to assorted music that you put on your ipod, you can't select them individually. You can play from your previously assorted playlist, but I usually just like to listen to anything that comes on to surprise me. Of course, you can skip tracks, and go back to previous ones. A good thing about the shuffle, is that I don't have to really worry about all these extra options they shove into mp3s, it's just a play and go. They're awesome, I highly recomend one.|`|DtS7Al6Maa	Samsung Yp-qi

You will not be able to use the internet at the same time, because you need to unhook that ethernet cord to plug in your 360. Alternative: Buy a cheap router, then run an enthernet cord from ur modem to the router then one to your computer and one to your Xbox. That sounds confusing I know. But it's really not. Then you set up your Xbox live account by choosing Join Xbox Live.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, I didn't forget. It's in the link I posted that it costs money....I wouldn't pay $50 for them right now.

The controller is black, the headset is black, and the hard drive is black. The Hard drive holds 120 gb compared to the 60 gb size of the pro console. The elite also comes with an HDMI cable. <br>  So technically you are saving money, because the 120 gb hard drive is $150 , and the hdmi cable is sold for 50 bucks, of course you could get a regular HDMI cable much cheaper anywhere else. <br>  <br>  So if you are planning on getting a 120 gb hard drive either way, just get the elite. The only reason you need that much room is if you plan to buy just about everything on the xbox live marketplace, or you just have tons of music. <br>  <br>  I know the new 360 Pro with 60 gb hard drive has a new motherboard called a Jasper motherboard. The fialure rate on those boards are somewhere around 1-2 % much less then the falcon boards and the 30 percent. Because more people buy the Pro and not the elite, your chances of getting an Elite with a falcon motherboard are much higher, than if you buy a Pro.

RyvKws7Laa	Ignore the contrast ratio outright.  The problem with those is that each manufacturer can measure it differently.  So the numbers they give you are all marketing with little real valuable data.  Best way to look at that is to go into a store and convince the clerks to let you play with the settings on the TV.  Or read some unbiased reviews online that look at the contrast in test situations, not just the random numbers the manufacturers throw at you.<br>  <br>  The refresh rate is how quickly it can redraw the image onto the screen each time it changes.  So the higher the number the better on LCDs.  It only really comes into play on LCDs.  Plasmas and DLPs work more like CRTs and are near instantaneous in their refresh (so any numbers you are quoted for them are kind of useless, because the technology itself trumps whatever number the box might say).<br>  <br>  Both issues though, contrast and refresh, matter more as you go bigger in screen size.  At 37" or lower, it doesn't matter that much at all really.  You just won't see the advantages/disadvantages all that much.  At 42" and above it can start to matter.  It becomes a much bigger deal as you cross into the 50's and beyond though.|`|usIma0vIaa	The refresh rate (most commonly the "vertical refresh rate", "vertical scan rate" for CRTs) is the number of times in a second that display hardware draws the data it is being given. This is distinct from the measure of frame rate in that the refresh rate includes the repeated drawing of identical frames, while frame rate measures how a video source can feed an entire frame of new data to a display.<br>  <br>  For example, most movie projectors advance from one frame to the next one 24 times each second. But each frame is illuminated two or three times before the next frame is projected using a shutter in front of its lamp. As a result, the movie projector runs at 24 frames per second, but has a 48 or 72 Hz refresh rate.<br>  <br>  On CRT displays, increasing the refresh rate decreases flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. However, if a refresh rate is specified that is beyond what is recommended for the display, damage to the display can occur.[1]<br>  <br>  For computer programs or telemetry, the term is also applied to how frequently a datum is updated with a new external value from another source (for example; a shared public spreadsheet or hardware feed).<br>  <br>  Contents [show]<br>  1 Cathode ray tubes <br>  2 Liquid crystal displays <br>  3 Computer displays <br>  4 Stereo displays <br>  5 Televisions <br>  6 Displaying movie content on a tv <br>  7 Computer data and telemetry <br>  8 References <br>  9 See also <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Cathode ray tubes<br>   <br>  A high speed exposure shows an electron beam in the process of scanning an imageIn a CRT, the scan rate is controlled by the vertical blanking signal generated by the video controller, ordering the monitor to position the beam at the upper left corner of the raster, ready to paint another frame. It is limited by the monitor's maximum horizontal scan rate and the resolution, since higher resolution means more scan lines.<br>  <br>  The refresh rate can be calculated from the horizontal scan rate by dividing by the number of horizontal lines multiplied by 1.05 (since about 5% of the time it takes to scan the screen is spent moving the electron beam back to the top). For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96 kHz at a resolution of 1280 × 1024 results in a refresh rate of 96,000 / (1024 × 1.05) ≈ 89 Hz (rounded down).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Liquid crystal displays<br>  Much of the discussion of refresh rate does not apply to the liquid crystal portion of an LCD monitor. This is because while a CRT monitor uses the same mechanism for both illumination and imaging, LCDs employ a separate backlight to illuminate the image being portrayed by the LCD's liquid crystal shutters. The shutters themselves do not have a "refresh rate" as such due to the fact that they always stay at whatever opacity they were last instructed to continuously, and do not become more or less transparent until instructed to produce a different opacity. Most of the TFT LCDs used in portable devices and computer monitors need a continuous refresh. The driving voltage determines the transmittance of the liquid crystal.<br>  <br>  The closest thing liquid crystal shutters have to a refresh rate is their response time, while nearly all LCD backlights (most notably fluorescent cathodes, which commonly operate at (~200Hz) have a separate figure known as flicker, which describes how many times a second the backlight pulses on and off.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Computer displays<br>  On smaller CRT monitors (~<14") few people notice any discomfort below 60–72 Hz. On larger CRT monitors (~>17") most people would experience mild discomfort unless the refresh is set to a more comfortable 85 Hz or higher. 100 Hz is comfortable for almost any size. However, LCD monitors suffer from different problems than their CRT predecessors and refresh rate would more accurately be referred to as frame rate in their case (often locked at 60Hz). The only part of an LCD that could produce CRT-like flicker, its backlights, typically operate at around 200–Hz.<br>  <br>  Different operating systems set the default refresh rate differently. Windows 95 and Windows 98(SE) set the highest refresh rate that they believe the display supports. Windows NT based OSs such as Windows 2000, its descendant Windows XP and Windows Vista, however, by default set the refresh rate to the lowest supported, usually 60 Hz. And the many variations of Linux usually have the user set up the display manager during installation and set the preferred settings. Although with xfree86 a default option is usually included. Many full-screen applications, such as games, are expected to allow the user to reconfigure their refresh rate before entering full-screen mode. Some poorly designed applications will launch directly into full-screen mode in an out-of-range setting and force the user to reconfigure their video settings "blind".<br>  <br>  Old monitors could be damaged if a user set the video card to a higher refresh rate than supported by the monitor. Currently most monitors would simply display a notice that the video signal uses an unsupported refr

I was just looking at Amazon, and their best selling TV is a Samsung, and its surprisingly cheep compared to BestBuy, which is 600$ more. Man! Best Buy is a RIPOFF.

IGVi7x0saa	First, you want to note that the switch is simply to Digital Television abbrievated as DTV.    HDTV is a transmitting and receiving option on DTV.     I suspect the biggest beneficiaries are the cell phone companies, who get to buy the use of the former analog frequencies and the US federal government who is auctioning off the frequencies.  <br>  In most locations in the US, you can put up some form of antenna and get a signal from a nearby town or city.   You may need to use an outdoor antenna and a signal amplifier but you should be able to get a signal.    Even if you have to spend $140 for an antenna and $60 for amplifiers, that is less expensive than a year of cable TV from most of the cable TV companies.    If you are in an urban area,  a UHF antenna such as the zenith silverbright should work well.   You may want to keep some ordinary rabbit ears too because some DTV transmissions are in the VHF band however 90% are on UHF now.  <br>  The digital transistion is something we must put up with.    I'm disappointed by it too because it renders every battery operated portable TV I have useless after the June 12, 2009 transition for portable use or use during a power outage, although such TV's can be attached to DTV converter boxes.     I live in a home that used to have cable and I'm utilizing the former cable lines to send the output of a VCR to televisions throughout my home.   I took the former cable line that used to go to the utility pole and wired it to the garage so I can watch my TV in the garage with Video Tapes DVD's or the output of my DTV converter box.    You do not have to get cable or satellite to enjoy TV after the transition, just make sure you have your box.   If you wish to watch different programs  on each <br>  TV, you need a box for every analog <br>  TV you own.   The cable TV companies, can take their overpriced fees and  can go (expletive- mouth washed out with soap word) themselves!

SKkE3fK1aa	I totally agree that it is a good sturdy phone with a good design! Especially the 2MP Camera and the 2GB MicroSD memory card!<br>  <br>  But, it doesn't have 3G! Newer phones now have 3G. 3G is a type of network connection to your network service (like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.). All phones including yours have GSM but, well, it is kinda basic since all that GSM can do is call, text and MMS as well as connect to the internet with a speed of ~48kbps.<br>  <br>  3G connection lets you have VIDEO CALLING, FASTER WEB BROWSING (on your phone! ~386kbps - 1.5mbps), etc. all that added to your standard GSM services as listed above.<br>  <br>  But, you can get a better phone for $200 such as the 6500 slide and the 6500 classic!|`|qhU3PDgfaa	its a nice phone..<br>  here you can see the complete details and reviews of that phone.. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7373-1690.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7373-1690....</a>|`|tgvNs8SHaa	YES IT LIKE SUCH A GOOD PHONE joanne novo i adore u and ur phone and 200 is alot but o well its a good phone :D:D:D:D|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	ok well the battery life is not that good at all go and get the nokia 6500 slide it is way better phone more memory longer battery life|`|GX1hvK8Yaa	Yes

CzfJNgaMaa	I have vonage and a cell. The advantage to that is vonage has a 24.99 / month plan with unlimited local and long distance to US, Canada and Puerto Rico, and unlimited calling to land lines in england france spain the uk and ireland. The nice thing about that of course is that it can save you alot of cash on overages on your cell if you use the phone a lot.<br>  <br>  And in response to DemonsAngel, something you dont hear very often is that vonage can work with satellite, but it depends on the quality of the connection you have. Specifically, if you have a dedicated connection, vonage should work just fine. However, if you have a shared connection, good luck getting decent audio quality unless you live in a very sparsely populated area where very few other people share the same channel on your satellite.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	i would not recommend Vonage, it will not work with satellite internet, if that's what you have. we had it for 2 days and they said (after we bought it) that it would not work while the guy in the store said it would.

BYHmKxpdaa	Ok I am going to attempt to explain our setup that my boyfriend came up with. He didn't want to do wireless because of lag and everything. We bought a Sling Media SlingLink and a router. He hooked the router up to cable modem, ran one ethernet to the computer and one to the SlingLink. It has to be plugged directly into the wall. It came with one other Link to plug directly into the wall in the living room, which he plugged into the 360. It uses the electrical wiring in your home as a network. It's much faster and more reliable than wireless, he does have some problems when playing games on Live, but I think that might be our internet provider. Hope this helps!!|`|y1D0N34Saa	I sounds like its your router 90% of the time a connection on a network keeps going out I would say its the router....I might be to wireless conection...try hooking it up with a ethernet chord and watching a movie if it doesn't go out its your wireless signal..try getting a booster or something...if it still goes out its your router itself...try getting a router with N Gigabit router that should do it.

SKkE3fK1aa	It's a Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition Smartphone with Feature Pack 1 (S60v3 FP1). It is powered by Symbian OS (I think is better than Windows Mobile OS) 9.2.<br>  <br>  The N95 8GB is better than the N95 because the User Memory is not Flash Memory (memory cards) meaning that data can be accessed by the CPU faster.<br>  <br>  The N95-8GB is great for N-Gage 2.0 Gaming because it has a Graphics Hardware Accelerator (a video card). Meaning, you can play nice 3D N-Gage and Symbian Games smoothly and nicely. Because of this, FORGET ABOUT your JAVA GAMES! GO WITH Symbian or N-GAGE 2.0 GAMES. <br>  <br>  The N95-8GB also has a 5MP Camera with AutoFocus! The AutoFocus is great for pitting down blurs and unwanted sharpness. Also, if you shoot either portrait or landscape, the N95-8GB's accelerometer will detect and correctly rotate the image when you are viewing.<br>  <br>  Uhh, what else... hmm... its a Dual Slide, so if you slide it to the north, your screen will be in landscape and when you slide it to the south, it will be in portrait. Also, the phone doesn't have auto-rotation even if the N95-8GB has the accelerometer and is actually kinda dumb because the newer crappier ones have it.<br>  <br>  It has WiFi and a Dual Core Processor (Dual ARM11 332MHZ CPU) which gives your phone a SPEED BOOST! Also has a whooppint 128MB SDRAM so you can open a lot (AND I MEAN A LOT) of applications!<br>  <br>  As for the Smartphone features, it's kinda next-gen. You got your Office Viewers (upgradable to editor and Microsoft Office 2007 support)<br>  for Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Also Adobe Reader LE for viewing PDF Files on the go. Not to mention Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 for viewing flash while on the web. It also has a great HTML Browser and easy to use!<br>  <br>  >> finally, this PHONE IS USELESS without applications. I for one will add a Dictionary with Audio support (MSDict), a GPS Maps Application (Google Maps, Nokia Maps, Garmin Mobile XT 5.00) and probably more N-Gage games and Symbian Games for my entertainment. Also, I will buy a BOSE or a JBL Headset so I can have a great music and multimedia experience!

b8uYVhVMaa	Before you even think about spending any amount of money on a decent camera - get a cheap one and go out taking some snaps.  You will find out quickly enough if you have an eye for photography and then you can start looking at improving your kit.    it is not the camera which makes a good photographer, it is the person.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Nikon D40 DSLR is good for beginner who want to photography.It easy to use.Compact and lightweight.Reasonable price.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000K...|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Those chunky black ones you refer to are most likely digital single lens reflex cameras or DSLR. I hate to be the one to disappoint you, but you cant get one for that little. The cheapest lens and body combination is the Nikon D40 and 18-55mm kit lens for 450 USD. From there they go on up to 40,000 USD and every where in between. And thats just the camera bodies, lenses tend to start at around $100 for very low quality and go up to 10,000 USD and even up closer to 50,000 or 100,000 USD fro some very specialized telephoto lenses. My advice to you, give your age and budget would be to go to your local camera store and see what they have for used film cameras which you can get for very very cheap these days. If you want a professional looking one, see if they have a Canon EOS-1, and for a lens the EF 50mm f/1.8. The two together may be a little above your price range, but will be a good start. Other than that, look into getting yourself a decent point and shoot, but if you really are interested in photography, I would recommend getting a used film camera.|`|vZMN82U8aa	er, (rhetorically) what, are Nikon the only camera manufacturer?     the D40 is a waste of recycled plastic, and badge engineering at its worst.     any decent digital camera worth a damn is close on 1000 pounds. and all teh big makes make one...     does mum bake a good cake, or is it the oven she bakes it in? (dont ask, youll get no cake)     we have a saying, if youre Sh it, get the kit... photography is an art, its subjective, its how YOU see the world... having a 52000 hassleblad, or a 20 quid lubitol makes no difference if you havent got a clue about composing or exposing... seriously.     dont blow youre hard earned on a toy. i have another phrase... id rather own a 15yr old mercedes than a five year old ford...     theres some excellent cameras out there in your price range, but theyre old... and in their day they cost thousands.. like the Olympus E1. magnesium body, guaranteed 100000 shutter releases.. and its waterproof... all for 150 quid.. you might even pick up a cheap E500.     at the end of the day, picl it up, hold it to your eye... how does it feel? its a zen thing... that camera will become an extention of your right hand... and you have ot be comfortable with it... many years ago i bought a fuji s9600, lovely camera (as a backup) but its horrible to hold, whereas my olympus's  feel great... its a personal thing...    and if you want great books on how to, goto mininova and search photography in the books...     oh and youll also need a good photoediting suite, like photoshop or paintshop pro. (9 11 or 12)     and youll need inspiration... go look at weatherunderground.com, or redturtle...     and good luck.
