UUC2KO3Daa	Ranking merely shows you how many people are viewing your site. not to minimize that  info, it's good information. But what about the restaruant that you "view" everyday on your way to work... but have never ate there?<br>  <br>  A good website is one that people (traffic) returns to again and again and again. I sold advertising for about 6 years. At one point I won Salesman of the Year. To sale renewals I had to convince them of the proven fact that most people do not respond to an ad (or a website as it were) until they have seen it on average - 7 times.  <br>  <br>  Having people look at your ad (or return to your website) over and over again is the key.<br>  <br>  Advertising differs in that you merely place the ad on a (or within a) medium/object that people have to look at over and over again.<br>  <br>  Calendars - maps - bathroom doors - the back page of the yellow pages (moreso than any other ad, the back is seen almost everytime you look at the yellowpages). This is called "stickiness" of an ad...  always in your hand or in your face.<br>  <br>  With a website it's a different propostion altogether. You have to create stickiness with "gimmicks" such as NewsLetters, forums, surveys, puzzles - other fun stuff to do on your website.  Discount of the Month (maybe a loss leader just to get them on the site). <br>  <br>   Remember K-Mart had the blue light specials? If you happened to be in the store whenever the bluelight came on... you were in for a bargain!<br>  <br>  Maybe every 200th purchaser gets to try a free product and report back on how it worked for them. One of the products that you think is going to be your bread and butter.<br>  <br>  Audience participation is KEY. (I used to sell Gingsu Knives in shopping centers!)<br>  <br>  <br>  STICKINESS. That's how your success is measured.  Not just a website ... but the place to be.  A reason to come back, instead of "y'all come back now, y' here?"<br>  <br>  You rather have 1200 returning cutomers than 12,000 who merely view or buy once.  Not how many people... but how many return.<br>  <br>  STICKINESS. Take it from me... I've been there.<br>  <br>  If I sell mops I want a chance to come back again and again to sell you mopheads, on a regular basis.  Give me a reason I HAVE to come back to your wbesite.  Maybe nobody has the quality of lithium batteries that you do, made in Israel by the Israeli Intelligence Dept... for the longetivity needed to combat terrorism. Gimme a reason!<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope ANY of this helps and I wish you much success. I like to see people that "make it happen".|`|9qsQ7v96aa	Rank would be very low.

5XltfLhTaa	Well I am not american, but I do surveys myself so I can give you some info on it. It does work, but you need to be alert as there are more survey scam websites out there then the legit ones.<br>  <br>  Just remember that the legit ones will never ask you to pay or buy anything. They will also never ask for your credit card info.<br>  <br>  As far as the free laptops and iphones go, they are usually given as a prize for a sweepstakes. Once you fill out a survey, you are entered into one automatically. I've never won anything since almost all of them are only open to ameircans, so lucky you :~(<br>  <br>  If you ae interested, I can reccommend the website that I use below. It contains lots of information on surveys, as well as the scams associated with it. Also it has a nice list of surveys that are legit and free to join. They are all listed according to countries so it makes it easier for us to find the ones we qualify for. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Daq9gituaa	I hope this will help you out. If your total income for 2008 was less than 56K, then you qualify to file for free compliments of a free program offered by the IRS. There are several providers to choose from. I prefer Turbo tax but they only offer the free file to folks with 30K or less gross income. Tax Act (by H&R Block) is also pretty good.<br>  <br>  In order to use the "free file" program, you must access it direct from the IRS web site: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/</a>     <br>  If you access any of the providers direct, you will be charged a fee.<br>  <br>  As for your state taxes:<br>  <br>  You may be able to do your NY taxes without charge if you are able to use Turbo Tax. If TT wants to charge you, access the program direct at:<br>  <a href="http://www.tax.state.ny.us/elf/homepc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tax.state.ny.us/elf/homepc.ht...</a><br>  <br>  As for MA - go to their web page:<br>  <a href="https://wfb.dor.state.ma.us/income/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://wfb.dor.state.ma.us/income/Defau...</a><br>  <br>  Since you are a part year resident for both states, you may have file by paper return. Just see what is required or allowable on the appropriate state web pages.<br>  <br>  <br>  Granted doing your own taxes can be intimidating but most people can file their returns especially if they are basic returns. It would be to your advantage to know how to file your own taxes so you have an idea of what is involved.

UDxL7lPqaa	Yes.  You should roll the 401(k) over into a traditional IRA first (both are pretax accounts).  Then look at converting from a regular to a Roth IRA.  The difference is that Roths are funded with "after tax" dollars.  You can't roll "before tax" dollars into one without tax consequences.|`|cTA9kWWfaa	Do not transfer it into one that is taxed. The purpose of 401(K)'s are to defer taxes till your low income earning years, aka retirement. It would hurt you to transfer it into an account that will take out taxes in one lump sum. I am helping Circut City Employees transfer their 401(k) and pensions into IRA's that are tax deferred just like they were when employed. Let me know if you need help rolling/transferring it over. We have accounts with guarenteed rates that you will earn over a specified number of years followed by a minimum floor which will consistantly earn you money unlike these others which can lose you a big chunk of change.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	You have income taxes taken out when you do the rollover.

You could also demand cash or Pay pal. You are right to suspect a scam. I buy and sell furniture,antiques,coins,gold and silver. I always pay cash or go right to the bank his or mine and get the funds with both of us together. Like me, the person should be licensed,insured and bonded, if he is running a legitimate business!!Check the better business bureau and /or your local police!  They will both help and if the guy is a crook and has a record or warrants, the police will make an arrest.<br>     DON'T RELEASE YOUR GOODS UNTIL YOU HAVE THE CASH!!!!<br>    Tagger. Tom Russano Auctions|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I would tell the guy to have his driver bring cash. I would never accept a check on craigslist even from someone in person because you have absolutely no way of knowing that the check will clear. Someone could have printed the check on their inkjet printer for all you know. <br>  <br>  When I sold furniture on craigslist, I gave buyers 2 options:<br>  <br>  1. Pay cash and pick it up at my house. <br>  <br>  2. Come look at the furniture at my house. Pay me cash in advance at my house for the furniture, plus $1/mile round trip for the distance from my house to yours and back, and I'll deliver it using my truck. But I won't even load it until they've looked at it and paid for it. So far I haven't had anyone take me up on this offer but I put it out there just so that people who don't have a truck available have an option.<br>  <br>  Either way, the only payment I accept is cold hard cash in person. Checks can bounce and you can't verify them until after your stuff is gone. Money orders can be forged. Paypal payments not only cost you a fee, but there are ways for the person to retract payment. This is a common ebay scam. People put in a paypal payment but cancel it before it clears. If the seller ships the product while paypal payment is pending, then the seller is screwed. That's why I keep it simple and demand cash. If the buyer has the money in the bank to write a check, its not that much more effort for them to go to the ATM and bring you cold hard cash instead.

PVkGScihaa	OK FIRST OF ALL IGNORE ALL SALES PITCHES AND TRAPS BELOW OF SCAMS:<br>  <br>  Right now we are in the recession in the United States and in Canada and pretty much all over the world.  The smartest thing you can do is to stay at your job for now until the recession is up.  However, this is the perfect time to take some schooling.  You can perhaps work as a sales manager for a boat cruise or the hotel industry.  What about destination management?  This field is awesome and fun but tough and a lot of work.  With destination management you plan events for companies so they can team build or for incentive programs and execute it.  <br>  <br>  Check around in Italy what schooling there it with the travel industry.  If you can put your desires into the schooling and wait for the recession to lift.

coXB7vf1aa	There is a thing called Quality Score that Google measures how well the people advertise.  If you've got an ad that says Make Money Online, and you choose keywords like Make Money Online, Make Money--words that match--the chances for your quality score going up and your click costs coming down are pretty good.<br>  <br>  Some beginners make Google Ads that are not that targeted and throw any old keyword just to get people looking.  Some bold ones use a keyword like "money". People click on it, and it turns out to be a porn site or something ridiculously unrelated.  Customers complain.  <br>  <br>  When customers complain, Google slaps these advertisers.  This is literally called a "Google Slap".  So Google says, "Hey, if you're going to play that little game, you get to pay $5 a click to be noticed."  Or something to that effect. It's supposed to be a deterrent, but at the same time, Google doesn't exactly turn away money.<br>  <br>  When you first start using Google Adwords, Google is watching how well you write your ads.  The closer you are to following their rules, paying your Adwords bill on time, etc., the lower your click costs will be. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend using Adword's content network which can be cheaper than everyone fighting for the top ad position on a search page, or use 7 search which gets you highly targeted ads for just a cheap, if not cheaper.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	They profile their users. Both from the searches they and from anything they ever write or receive using Gmail.  All gmail messages are scanned for information about the person who owns the account - it is in their user terms when you sign up.<br>  <br>  If user A does a search on "pointy little shoes" and they have User A in the top demographic for purchasing such things, they will present user a with results or links to their higher paying clients.<br>  <br>  If user B does a search on "pointy little shoes" and they have user B as a teenage schoolkid, then user B will be presented with results and links to their lower paying clients. <br>  <br>  Set up three computer, yours, a kids and maybe your wife's, open a Google search page and type in "Birthday present" and see what comes up on each system. If you often do searches on fishing, you are likely to get merchants with fishing gear or marine equipment, if your wife often searches on fashion accessories, then she will be presented to links to clothes and shoes, etc.<br>  <br>  Your kid is likely to come up with computer games iPods, kid toys.<br>  <br>  We have often done that sort of thing in the office - just for the fun of it. Of course if you only ever use one computer and no different user account on it, there is no knowing what it will come up with - although they will take the time of day into account.|`|fXvOEZ8Yaa	The amount of money you bid per click (combined with your advertisers score) translates into the position your ad will get on a page with your keyword.<br>  So, yes, paying more gets you better placement and thus better and more clicks...|`|PwFHo71paa	I would suggest to drop whole idea of AdWords all together and instead focus on affiliate marketing and work with ad network such as CJ, PapperJam or IdeaMamaAdNetwork (last one has no setup fee).

Their basic wage is lower than what they could earn elsewhere because they expect a bonus to top up the wages.<br>  <br>  Some teams and individuals make the banks millions of pounds in profit from their expertise, whilst some teams/individuals have lost millions of pounds.

qhENBYAHaa	No, it is very hard to be hired as an attorney without any legal experience.  Once you graduate law school your immediate concern is to pass the Bar Exam.    In order to be a licensed attorney in your state you must pass the Bar.  So, if you graduate law school in May you are cramming for the July Bar exam.  <br>  <br>  Currently, law firms are laying off associates.  It is a very tough time to be a new attorney.  Most states have a glut of lawyers and the law schools, in their effort to get more money, continue to accept more students.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Depends on where you live and what type of law you want to get into.
qhENBYAHaa	Criminal law is only a very small segment of attorney jobs available.   There are attorney jobs in corporations, for churches, for entertainers, for sports figures --- go to www.abanet.org  that is the American Bar Association website it has a special section for those thinking about law as a career.<br>  <br>  Not all lawyers go into court rooms.  Some of us handle administrative hearings held in offices, some do work that never results in any type of hearing.  Many times a lawyer is hired to review documents and make sure a company follows the law.  The great thing about a law career is that there are so many things that a person can do with a law license.<br>  <br>  BUT, do not think it is easy to become a licensed attorney.  Law school is 3 years (4 years evening) of very intense study.  That is after graduating college.  Then there is the 2 day Bar Exam which a person must pass to be licensed.  Finally there is problem of getting a job which right now is tough.  And once you get a job the pay is not as much as the media says it is.  Only a tiny percentage of all attorneys make 6 figure salaries.   <br>  <br>  Learn all you can about becoming a lawyer.

b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	Sorry if this is rude but you must have misunderstood.<br>  <br>  A bank's balance sheet is commonly 90% debt and 10% equity.  Most of the bank's assets will be in loans.  Maybe you are thinking one dollar in equity (capital) can support nine dollars in loans?<br>  <br>  When someone deposits money in the bank the bank must keep some on reserve and then will lend most of it (don't remember the reserve ratio) to loan customers.  The loan customjmer/borrower might then put some of his money into a deposit account and so on and so forth.  This is commonly known as a multiplier effect.

AcgDcQG0aa	Officially, the shareholders who buy shares of the company are part owners of this company.  And as owners, they are entitled to a fair share of its profits.<br>  <br>  But in practice, many company managers get around this theoretical ownership by paying themselves multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses, which often leaves debts on the company books rather than profits for the regular shareholders.|`|bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	The value of the company (what you would pay to buy the company) is the price of a share times the number of shares.  So, the stock price is not CONNECTED to the value of the company; it IS the value of the company.<br>  <br>  A dividend has nothing to do with the price of the shares.  It is declared in dollars and cents, not a percent of the market value.  That is simply a calculation. <br>  <br>  The company ares because if it goes down, it's easier for some other company to take over the company and fire the management.  If the stock price goes up, the company can use the stock to take over other companies.  The management frequently has compensation that increases with the stock price.|`|AA10007793	The company never owned the stock in the first place.  Someone, a person, did.  When a company goes public the proceeds are invested in the company to finance assets and projects.  And sometimes to pay off debts.  Those proceeds come from the new owners. who bought the stock in the IPO.  And they do care about the stock price.  If the stock price doubles that usually means profits are expected to increase, probably as a result of the money invested from the IPO.  And profits (retained earnings) are where the dividends come from.

I am pretty sure that it is linked to the DLA and not the income support as that one isn't listed but I could be wrong. Carers allowance is eligible along with incapacity benefit.<br>  <br>  It's basically a one off for this year and I am not sure they will be doing it again, but Its something to do with the fact that normally everyone gets an increase in april in line with inflation BUT because of the economy and the prices if everyday living has gone up, the government don't want people to wait that longer.<br>  <br>  This is from Money savings expert which is a great forum for items like this: This is what one posted put:<br>  he Chancellor, Alistair Darling is speaking.<br>  <br>  I can also confirm that state pensions will increase in line with the highest rate of inflation this year. This will increase the basic state pension for a single person from ￡90.70 to ￡95.25—an increase of ￡4.55 a week. Now that inflation is expected to fall quickly, pensioners should see a real benefit.<br>  <br>  I do not want people to have to wait for this extra money. I want them to get it as quickly as possible, which will benefit them as well as the economy. So families will not have to wait until April to receive their increase in child benefit. Instead, they will start to get it in January—three months early.<br>  <br>  I want to do the same for pensioners. Pensioners are already getting the winter fuel payment—increased again this year. However, I want to do more. So I will ensure that every pensioner gets a one-off payment of ￡60, on top of the ￡10 Christmas bonus, from January. For couples, that figure will be ￡120, also paid from January. That ￡70 payment will also go to children with disabilities.<br>  <br>  The quote is from Hansard.<br>  <br>  Anyway Please please report those other two and hope this has helped answer your question.

hYDCgs9Xaa	You are a smart woman and this is a really good question.  Your instincts are correct.  Do NOT pay half of the mortgage on this house unless your name is on the Deed and Mortgage.  Think about it - what if you live there with him for 5 years and have paid half the mortgage for all of those years and then he decides to leave you for someone else? You get nothing.  You were basically renting and now you have to leave.  Tell him that you understand and agree that he is entitled to the money he has saved, but that you are not going to pay half of the mortgage every month without the house being in your name too.  This being the case, you can even sign something saying that if you do end up selling the house in a couple of years (or if one of you decides to leave) that he will get his original money back, and after that you will split the proceeds.  So let's say he's putting down 10k on the house.  The house costs 100k and when you sell it in 2 years you get 130k for it.  He would get his 10k back first, and then you would each get 10k of the proceeds. (Best case scenario you guys are still together and then have a total of 30k to put down on another bigger house!) This way he knows you are not trying to take advantage of his money but just want security for yourself- this is an investment for both of you, not just him.  If he doesn't agree then don't live with him- he's obviously not ready for a commitment with you.  <br>  I used to work for a mortgage foreclosure firm and would hear from people who got into a situation like that asking me what rights they had and the answer was if you're not on the mortgage and/or deed then you don't have any rights to the house whatsoever.  Protect yourself.  Also buying a house (with your name on the mortgage) will help build your credit!  If he wants to be with you for the long run he should want you to build your credit and want you to be protected.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	1) if you are only going to live there for 2-3 years, DO NOT buy the house.<br>  2) If you have been dating for only 2 years, DO NOT buy the house.<br>  3) If you do buy the house, PLEASE DON'T, his basis in the house should be offset by the amount he put down....assuming you both will be paying exactly half of the mortgage.  So lets say that you buy a $100,000 house and he puts down 10,000.  You sell it later for $150,000.....you would get $70,000 and he would get $80,000. That would be the fair way to approach it.|`|L7PkYZVzaa	It sounds to me like your boyfriend needs YOUR help with a mortgage he wouldn't be able to afford without you.  Either you're buying the house together with 50% rights for both of you, or you shouldn't go into this.  Buying a house together is a really big deal, as sometimes things go south and the only way to split and go your separate ways is to sell the house or one partner will have to have enough cash of their own to buy-out the other person.<br>  <br>  This doesn't sound like a very wise thing to get into without more of a "lifetime" and equitable commitment from him.|`|Pc7EiyBHaa	If you are able to pay half of the down payment and half of the mortgage it would give you equal ownership if done in writing.  Don't enter into a financial agreement of this commitment level without the ring commitment first.  You will end up losing everything you pay on the house and legally won't be able to do anything about it if you separate for whatever reason.  He would get the house.  Be very careful that you arrange everything in writing even if you just type it yourself and you both sign it in front of a notary.  People lose life savings and things all the time because they trust people they are with.  It is not good to do that.  Always do things financially in writing so you don't lose and he doesn't lose anything either.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I agree that you should be on the mortgage in some capacity if you are paying half the mortgage.  I would recommend writing up an agreement where he gets the money he put in for the down payment (plus interest) back when you sell the house, and you split what is left.  If you get engaged somewhere along the way it will no longer matter, it'll be 50 / 50, but if something happens and you break up at least you are BOTH protected.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	unmarried, unengaged people should NEVER buy real estate together, especially with as young as you are. How do you expect to be able to afford it of only one of you will be working at  a time and the other will be in school? - forget buying anything until you are both done with school and working full time and IF you plan on getting married at that point- I doubt you would qualify for a mortgage with only one income fresh out of school anyway. where would you be coming up with the 10+% cash you'll need for down payment and closing costs???|`|bmP4NdKuaa	Property can only be split equally. There is no such thing as 10/90% ownership. All signs are pointing to not buying a house at this time. You are looking at problems and ultimatums and you have not even bought your house yet! I wouldn't even consider living with this person, but hey, that's me.|`|kifwyOgKaa	I would advise not to do this unless the two of you are married.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Don't buy a house with this guy.<br>  <br>  I bought a house with my partner, and we are not married.  However, we both contributed to the deposit, and are both on the title and the mortgage.  We are in this together, even if we rent the house out after a few years.  My portion of the deposit was far larger than his, but that doesn't change anything.  We share the responsibility equally and we are both legally liable for the loan.  We are in it together.  <br>  <br>  You are not in the same situation.  You won't be on the title, and you won't be on the mortgage paperwork.  So you're not part of the deal.  That isn't right.<br>  <br>  You should tell him you are not ready to buy the house right now until you have saved a little for the deposit and have repaired your credit a little.  If he doesn't want you on the paperwork, what long term plans does he have for you?  It sounds very dodgy to me.  I mean, you would still be contributing towards the mortgage, even though you are not on the paperwork.  That is not fair. You might as well live somewhere else and pay rent, if you're not going to be part owner of the property.<br>  <br>  I say balk at the idea.  Do not go down this path.  Tell him to wait until you are in a situation where you can contribute, so you can be on the books legally.  It will be worth it if you break up.  Remember, there is a rather large age gap between you, and people change as they mature.  In a few years, this guy might not be the guy you thought he was.  <br>  <br>  I say your gut feeling is right. Say no and walk away.  If he wants to buy the house, do not contribute to the mortgage, but stash your cash in a savings account and investments instead.  You need to look after yourself.  He should respect that.  This is a big warning sign that maybe you shouldn't be with this guy. You are not a free lunch.  Your finances are just as important as his are.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|qBCGH52haa	If you are going to pay 1/2 of the mortgage payment, do not enter this arrangement unless you have an equitable ownership stake.  If you are not on the deed, all your money is gone should you and your boyfriend decide to break up.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that if he is worried about his down payment, the two of you see a lawyer and write up an agreement stating that ownership of the house is 50/50, but should you break up, you each will be given the opportunity to buy out the other.  His down payment will come off the top of the agreed upon price (based on a current market appraisal paid for by both of you).  It might work something like - he puts down $20,000 on a house - house is worth $150,000 and you break up.  Normally, who ever would buy the other out would pay $75,00 for half.  In this case, since he has already put in $20,000 to buy you out, he would have to pay you $65,000 which would pay for the half house less credit for the down payment, while you would have to pay $75,000 which would reimburse him for the half of the down payment he placed.  Either that, of you could sign an IOU promising to pay him back the $10,000 while you live there.<br>  <br>  But remember, if you are not on the deed/title, you have no rights in the house regardless of how much you might pay into the mortgage.

You should adjust this every pay period and consider revising it every time you make a transaction, like bank withdrawals or atm purchases.

You can subscribe one month, and make sure you get all the info you need and then stop the subscription.<br>  <br>  If you want to try federal sources, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. <br>  <br>  CFDA has several ways to search for grants.

You should ask for a withdrawal of the listing, if that is indeed the case.  You need to establish if it will be a conditional or unconditional withdrawal.  They cannot force you to remain in a contract if they're providing sub-par service.<br>  <br>  If you're just nervous and are having second thoughts, that is not a valid reason in which to terminate the contract.<br>  <br>  Have you asked the agent to also advertise the property for rent, in conjunction with its for sale status?

389101751f4e180560f4530a7d0e9718aa	You need to reduce your expenses or increase your income. Reducing expenses works best for me. The biggest ways you can do this are in expense categories that are recurring--those you must pay every month that represent a big part of your income. The quickest to address are downsize your car expenses ASAP. You can do this by selling what have at top price as listed on KBB.com private party value. If you take your time selling you should be able to get "Private Party" value for your car. Then plan to buy a lower cost, reliable used car that Consumer Reports rates as most reliable. That way you can minize your repair costs--this is typically a huge ongoing expense for most people. I have four older cars that are of these types that Consumer Reports recommends most reliable: Honda civic and Odyssey, Ford escort and Suburu (mine has 284,000 miles on it). Also, these cars get good gas mileage. Another priority when you buy to help you save $. When you buy use KBB.com and try to find cars selling for well under the Private Party value. I always buy well used cars this way. I wait until I see one advertised well below the private party value, then I call asap, give seller a $50 deposit and write up a contract I will buy it subject to my mechanic finding no major problems. You want to buy an older car for cash (like $1,500) so you don't have to pay any collission or other extra insurance and that reduces your expenses more. I have a Ford Escort wagon (I like wagons and vans because cops pull you over less on these family cars--we have way too many cops, not that I get tickets. But I digress . . .) I bought my Ford Escort wagon for $1,500 five years ago and it has 180,000, miles and looks great, drives like a dream and has had the lowest repair cost of any car I owned. That is my dream car because you can buy them so cheap, about 1,000 for a 1993 easy. Then be sure you shope insurance coverage among various companies--Geico tends to have cheap coverage--to get lowest cost insurance. If you own a home, you can do that same idea by looking for a bargain house. With the depressed market this is a great time to buy a fixer upper well below market to reduce your housing expenses asap. Sell your current home at market rate. If you rent, you need to own because you reduce your expenses by deducting the payment from your taxes. If your credit score is above 500 you should be able to get a loan or find a lender who can help you get your credit score up. By the way, better to buy one of those well used cars with a loan to reduce your car expenses. In general you need to become a serious bargain buyer on quality cars and on houses. You can find bargain houses on the HUD website of foreclousres using a realtor. Your husband sounds like he could do the fixing up and you could immediatly buy equity and build your wealth. Just be sure to bid way low on HUD foreclosures--realtors will suggest you bid too high. Be cheap, cheap, cheap and you will reduce your monthly expenses on these things.<br>  <br>  One other point, if you find yourself overspending on consumer stuff you buy, you need to get self control. Best way to do this is not a budget but fasting. Start skipping a meal and then work up to where you skip food one day per week. I fast a day a week regularly and am unbelievalbe disciplined. I must be because I provide for a family of 6: with 5 older girls, two in college, etc. Talk about expensive! But I never buy anything in a store on impulse because fasting has trained me to be way disciplined.|`|96eb339b66a7b136e3985868d53786dcaa	just keep in your bank account at least 3-4 times of your monthly salary for out of control expense!|`|3de282022767aa728ed93f7a52733020aa	The trick is finding out where you are spending your money and simply being aware of it.  Take a small notebook and write down everything you spend or collect receipts.  Budgeting is like dieting.  You have to keep track of everything that you put in your mouth.

A budget is a plan for how you are going to spend your money.  You make a plan, then you follow the plan.  It sounds simple because it is!  It doesn't have to take a lot of time and it doesn't need to be hard.<br>  <br>  Also, when trying to save money, make sure to take the savings OUT of your bank account as soon as you can.  That way you can't slip up and spend it on other things.

Maybe they read your total $36.00 as $30.00 and assumed you did not tip.  A six could look like a zero.  It is the restaurant's fault, but unfortunately it's the server who gets the short end of the stick on this one.  <br>  I would not worry about your bank account - I doubt the restaurant will realize.

KN3I89Ycaa	I applaud you for wanting to do the right thing, and you should.  You say the bills are small.  Start with the smallest.  Call the company and ask for, in writing, what debt is owed.  Do not agree to pay it or really say anything else.  Don't acknowledge that you owe it, just ask for the information.  It has probably already been sent to collections, which you can verify on your credit report.  If you have the money, contact the company and pay it.  You can ask if it can be settled for less, but if it's $100, they probably won't.  Once you pay one off, call another.  verify they're on your credit report.  There is a statute of limitations on collecting debt.  If it's not on your report and it's over 5 years old, it's gone at this point.  Paying them won't put them on for another 7 years.  They only report for 5-7 anyway.  It looks better if you pay them too.  Ask that they send you a "paid in full" statement and send them payment by check or money order and write Paid in Full on the memo line.  By cashing it, they declare it's paid in full.  Good luck.|`|AA11173563	Bart is correct get every thing in writing and pay by check and just start at the bottom and work up one at a time|`|8yQYmxVOaa	They are most likely past the statute of limitations in collection, and if you pay your debt will be re-aged and your credit score even lower. Let them fall off. The original companies most likely no longer own the debt and if you have not been contacted by a collection agency you really do not know who you would pay. Additionally after 5 years the fees, and interest added to them will be astronomical. Let them go|`|PA7kYyAxaa	You simply need a plan to retire all the debt. Contact the companies/creditors and get the amounts. Prepare a schedule and a plan to rid yourself of them. Take notes, keep good records, get everything in writing.<br>  <br>  "The future belongs to those who prepare for it" ~ Jim Moran|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	It sounds like you are realizing the mistakes you have made and are standing up to correct them. I applaud you. It is great to see in this day and age. Yes, you can sometimes negotiate with creditors on old debt to pay less than the total. Just call them up and see what you can work out. This is the way my wife and I are working our debts. <br>  We are a huge fan of Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It has helped my wife and I get our "old" stuff in order and we are making tremendous headway. First don't get that credit card. You don't need to go into more debt while you are trying to get out of debt. These are positive and negative forces working against each other. Believe me, you don't want the negative forces to win. Pay cash for everything. AT most only use a debit card. It is money you already have. Don't buy stuff you don't need. Sell some stuff you bought that you shouldn't have. Its only stuff. Once you are out of debt and financially able, you can buy more stuff with cash. Stay out of restaurants, bars, movies vacations, etc. until you get these things cleared up. Those are negative forces working against you. Here is a brief overview of how Dave Ramsey's plan works.<br>  <br>  1. Save $1000 quick. This is a mini emergency fund. If your car needs a new tire you will not go into debt to fix your car, you wil pay cash.<br>  <br>  2. "Debt Snowball" - List all of your debts largest to smallest. Pay the minimums on all but the smallest one. Look under the seat of your car and in the sofa cushions for every extra dime you can find. Throw all the money you can at the smallest debt on the list until it is paid off. Once this is done, move up the list to the next largest debt. Take the money you would have paid on the smallest one that is no longer on the list and apply it to the next one up. Now, add that money to every extra dime you have and make a larger payment until the 2nd one is gone. Keep rolling all the money up the list. You can see that as you go up the list, you have more and more money to throw at the larger and larger debts. Thus, The Debt Snowball. <br>  <br>  Note: I know people tell you to throw the most money at the highest interest rate debt. There is merit there. But, I am a proponent of feeling like I have made progress as well. You will get a psychological and emotional high as you see these fall off the list. By doing it smallest to largest, you will become more intense as you go along seeing all these things fall off the list. You also are more likely to stick with the program if you feel you are making progress.<br>  <br>  3. Fully funded emergeny fund. That is 3 to 6 months of living expenses in an account that you do not touch. If you lose your job, how would you pay for things. Let me tell you, if you do not have this fund and you have a credit card, where do you think you will put your bills?  Good answer. You'll be right back where you are now.<br>  <br>  The key to making this work is 1.You have to get mad at your debt. and 2. Changing your spending habits. You must live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  That is a quick overview of the first couple of steps. It goes on to Investments, college for the kids, paying off your house and retirement investing. This really has helped my wife and I out. We are about half way through our debt snowball now. In fact, I just the final title for a paid off car last week. Now both cars are ours. In our debt snowball, This frees up about $800 a month to roll up to the next debt on the list. <br>  <br>  With only about $3000 in debt you should make it out relatively soon depending on your income. You will not believe how you will fell when this is done and you are standing there owing noone. <br>  I hope all goes well for you and this information is useful. It sounds like you have a great attitude and I wish you all the best. Good Luck.|`|AA11364723	You don't mention if the creditors are contacting you or not or if they simply wrote these bad debts off.  Unless they are hounding you for pymt., leave it alone.  Yes, if you start paying them, it opens the account back up and you are basically admitting that these debts are yours.  Not a good idea.  Let them just fade away is my advice.  Not responsible, no.  But some things from your past you just have to let go.  If you don't, you'll incur lots of new entanglements and wreck your current credit rating.

Also you'll be liable for all tha liabilities pertaining to your registered business. If your business is in operation, you will need to file taxes too. In fact, unless you have the intention to dod the business or otherwise there's no point in keeping the licence if you do not intend to operate it. Why not look into some other businesses that do not require you to have a business licence and without much liabilties?

AA12076992	Yes I sell stuff on Ebay.  I have pretty good luck,  Make more at it than I used to make as a Court Clerk.  <br>  <br>  Really you have to try selling stuff till you find what you are good at selling.  <br>  <br>  Advice for a newbie.  It is going to take a lot more time and work than you think.  So be ready for that.  And figure your costs carefully Ebay and Paypal take quite  large cut.|`|64b458dc74ea429f7b0d9b794715dd0daa	Selling on eBay is not simple nor all that profitable. You need to price your goods very carefully because eBay and PayPal (owned by eBay) take a big chunk of fees. Also you have to factor in your shipping and handling costs, etc. Collecting your money can be problematic. There is also a perception that there are a lot of scammers on eBay (and there are). <br>  <br>  If you are really looking to make some money, sit down and do an inventory of your skills and experience. Brainstorm with a good friend, trying to come up with different business ideas. Anything goes! Don't pre-judge your ideas.<br>  <br>  Now list each idea at the top of a seperate page. Make 2 columns: good stuff and bad stuff about the idea. Over a few days or weeks review and add to these lists.

Even though eBay states they provide you 'protection', it is very difficult, if not impossible, to actualy get it. Almost everything eBay tells you is countered by someother 'policy' of theirs. Also, my experience, and many many others who have dealt with "PayPal" [a subsidery of eBay], is that they will eventually get into your pocket, and know ahead of time, they are not bound by any regulatory laws and you 'agree' to give away any that you might have in the "user agreement". Put eBay or PayPal in your search engine and see what millions have to say....

0c5c21cf82599dd56623f6ff26cfb482aa	Tips:<br>  <br>  1. Have a professional-looking resume filled with relevant work experience. Work Experience is CRUCIAL (more than just good grades). If you haven't got alot of work experience, you might wanna consider internship or volunteering work somewhere. <br>  2. Submit resume to corporate website, ALSO go to career fair and make sure you talk to the recruiter and impress them OR visit their office! (it shows how much you want the job)<br>  3. Once selected for interview... definitely *"=research="* the company so you have topics to talk about with the interviewers... (The more you can talk about the company, the greater the chance of you getting hired.

43885d249f6e12d0c9543cbcbaffc9bbaa	Is this a commercial or private endeavor?  <br>  First, decide how much money you have to spend.  After all, it does no good to look at 900K properties when you only have 110K.  Second, decide what area you want the property to be in, be realist, it must be in your price range.  Third, go to one of the many real estate sites on the Internet, even Yahoo and start checking for availability and price.  Fourth, go look at the properties that seem interesting, just drive by and look.  If any really hit the mark,  you can approach the listing agent or owner about touring the property.   Fifth, if its what you want, make an offer - which will require posting escrow money and signing a Purchase Agreement.  Sixth, have an attorney or your real estate agent, review the agreement before you sign and return it. <br>   <br>  After the agreement is accepted, its another ball game.|`|0a59bc0685e2703a948b8d261f416937aa	use your local mls to search for property.|`|0bcec590474d5ed051ccda78f34cce88aa	Where are you planning to buy a house? what country.|`|6e17cb76a30c03f25817ad13d8880dacaa	local mls listings are good|`|740fffb14b811dc8703cc4da93076b24aa	Why waste valuable time?

I don't think it can be done with bank financing, as in the guys that can pull it off are the ones holding (in your case $360,000), enough to buy it fix it and flip it.<br>  I think you need to pursue it through conventional means and if you pull it off think how easy the next deal will be.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6db675de226ac878eccfaa6e72d0ccddaa	What collateral would you use for the 380, if not the property you are purchasing?<br>  Use a great mortgage broker. <br>  Most sellers attorneys will need to have time to order title, anyway.  Maybe even local inspections and compliance.  Once your offer is accepted, either or both sides make have to request extensions for these issues.<br>  If your credit score were higher you would find lenders more agreeable.  Above 700.<br>  $40,000 credit would need to be reserved for after purchase, use before purchase would throw the debt ratios off and cause the interest rate to be higher on the purchase.  Use it for the rehab if you must.<br>  Get approved subject to appraisal, and closing conditions.<br>  This process with only 5% down and your under 700 score, could possibly take 2 weeks.<br>  Try 3% down, same time.<br>  Check with Mort officer for a closing date for two weeks after offer is accepted.  You purchase when he says, you can meet this criteria, with underwriting.<br>  If you want a faster timing.  Check out the equity in your other properties and make the purchase with 20-25% down, no-doc, you will pay more with the low credit score, but it wont be substantial amt for short term invest.  You will still have to allow 2 weeks after acceptance, for appraisal and distribution of funds.<br>  Look into possible FHA 203K, not sure if I have the term correct.  For rehab with little down options.
740fffb14b811dc8703cc4da93076b24aa	It is done often and it is common with the first time home buyer.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford the closing costs, your agent needs to be an expert at negotiations and get them paid as part of your offer to purchase a property.<br>  <br>  What credits is she referring to?  Many lenders will look at "credits" given - not the closing costs per say - and determine that they're not allowable.  Be sure they explain this to you.<br>  <br>  Everything is done at escrow with regards to the closing costs, credits, etc. as part of the escrow process.<br>  <br>  Your agent should be explaining this all to you from the beginning of the offer through the close of escrow.  Make sure they do - it's their job.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in securing your dream home!|`|4658a60eced81abada410cfa0a82efeeaa	Yes, it is very common, even in a hot market. Take this for example:<br>  <br>  Sellers house is listed for $97,000<br>  <br>  My buyer has loan approval for $100,000, loves the house and wants to write a contract but cannot afford closing costs. I advise them that they can try and add in their offer, that the seller is to pay closing costs. They are concerened the offer will not be excepted. So, we offer $99,000 and ask for $2,500 for closing costs. In the end the seller is getting $96,500.<br>  <br>  See how it could possibly work out? You do not always have to offer more than list price but your contract is more likely to be accepted especially with mutiple offers or with sellers who are trying to net a certain amount.<br>  <br>  The seller will we debited at closing for the closing costs. There are seller debits and seller credits. Closing costs are debits in a case where seller has agreed to pay them. Otherwise they would be a Buyer debit.<br>  <br>  Your Realtor should be able to help you find what is best for you and answer these questions, don't be afraid to ask! Good Luck!|`|AA11401609	sellers would pay closing costs if the market is slow and this is the only way to sell the home, otherwise unlikely.  If you can't afford the closing costs, you can't afford to be buying a home.... it's the least of your costs of ownership..there are taxes, insurance plus the payments and repairs.|`|4ca8a56f014740896f66fbfe06e15368aa	I always tell my clients to ask for closing cost assistance (help) so that will enable you to free up your funds for things you need in your new home.   Having a seller pay for closing costs, is very normal - the asking price is normally higher in anticipation of this.  Realitors know that ppl need cc help.  <br>  <br>  Cost associated with your loan. You will need to pay for the appraisal up front (when it being done). You will need to pay for The Home Owners Insurance Coverage for 1 YEAR .  The seller can help you with up to 6 percent of closing cost. So the title fee, lender fees, underwriting fees, flood cert, broker fees,  etc can be paid for by the seller.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not knowing your rights and obligations <br>         Real estate law is extensive and complex; the contract for sale and purchase is a legally binding document. An improperly written contract can cause the sale to fall through or cost you thousands of dollars for repairs, inspections, and remedies for title defects. <br>  <br>  You must be certain which repairs and closing costs are your responsibility. You must know whether the property can legally be sold “as is” and how deed restrictions and local zoning will affect the transaction. If there are defects in the title, or if the property is in conflict with local restrictions, you or your Realtor must remedy them. Otherwise, you could lose thousands! <br>  <br>  It is your Realtor’s job to know the laws governing real estate transactions. They are involved in an on-going training program to keep up-to-date with these laws.        You deserve to have an agent who is not only knowledgeable about the transaction, but is also willing to educate you throughout the process so you will feel more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Failing to make your own inspection <br>  <br>  You probably would not want to rely on the seller to point out defects in a house he is attempting to sell. There may even be hidden problems of which he is unaware. <br>  <br>  Be sure your sales contract is worded so that any “earnest money deposit” must be returned in the event the house fails inspection. If a major defect is found, you have the option to cancel the contract and have your deposit returned, bargain for a lower price to compensate for the cost of repairing the problem, or have the owner make needed repairs before the sale. <br>  <br>  Even before you get to the point of a contract and having a professional inspector look at the house, there are many items you can check yourself as you are shopping for a home. <br>  <br>  Structure – Basement, check the foundation for cracks or water marks. Floors, are they level? Does the roof sag? <br>  <br>  Water damage – Look for unevenly painted ceiling or wall; mildew odor in basement; signs of re-plastering or re-tiling in just one area of the room. <br>  <br>  Water pressure – Flush toilet and turn on both hot and cold water faucets at the same time to test. <br>  <br>  Plumbing – Ask what type pipes are installed and their age. If applicable, ask when the septic system was last inspected and cleaned. Stand near the tank to detect odor or soggy ground. <br>  <br>  Wiring – A 100-amp system is typical in modern construction and uses a one-inch main line; this can be seen leading to the fuse box. Appliances such as dryer or range require a 220-amp line. Notice if lights flicker or don’t work. Check for electrical outlets . . . usually at least 2 in each room. <br>  <br>  Energy efficiency – Ask to check last year’s heating and cooling bills. Determine if proper insulation has been used. <br>  <br>  Pests – Be alert for small accumulation of sawdust in the basement. This might indicate an insect problem. Obtain date and results of the last wood-destroying pest inspection.

The non-standard convention to use DES (standard) when we actually mean DEA (algorithm) is so widespread that in order to avoid confusion we use it in this article. On the other hand, since there are variations of TDES which use two different keys (2TDES) and three different keys (3TDES) the non-standard abbreviation 3DES is confusing and should be avoided.

If you are not charging a percentage or finder's fee or are charging substantially less, they will probably want to hear what you have to say.|`|26c5dd79a5f00c0cdaf135c1767cff91aa	Ask for someone in recruiting first if there is not a recruiting department then ask for HR. Many of the really large companies won't bother with a staffing agency because they have enough staff to do their recruiting for them. Some companies will go as far as black-listing the resumes they receive from a staffing agency because they don't want to be liable for the placement fees.

tYpnQiqgaa	Well, you have a couple options. First, if the mortgage was foreclosed on, and that lien is not satisfied, than technically, you're living there at the grace of whomever is owed money(ESPECIALLY if they are first lienholder..).<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is to immediately secure a refinance, cash out some of the equity to clear that lien, and move on with your life. <br>  <br>  Your other option is what you suggested, but no entity in their right mind is going to let a $40,000 asset just slide off the books. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you really want a stable environment for your kids, I would either clear that lien quick, fast, and in a hurry, or Sell that house uber-fast and use the proceeds from the sale as a down payment on a house with a clear title. Who knows? You may like the new house more. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but not even bankruptcy can do much to protect you now (It'll staunch the bleeding, but eventually....)

Starting from kindergarten. We liked each other. I always said I would marry him.We lost touch in high school and both married someone else. In 1998 he came back to Mi.( ironic he was in San Diego Calf). He was now divorced.I can't tell you how happy he made me for six years. I was not divorced and there is so much to this story I won't go into all the details. I can only tell you I still am truly, madly, deeply in love with Keith and always will be.<br>  Things didn't work out because of me and I regret that now. I hopeone day I get a second chance with him. I can only tell you, I think you should contact him. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. If you don't you will always wonder what might have been. Take care of yourself dear girl. Best of luck to you in all you do.

Entscheiden musst du dich letztendlich selbst, das kann dir keiner abnehmen.<br>  <br>  Was dir zur Entscheidungsfindung helfen kann ist, wenn du dir eine Liste mit zwei Spalten schreibst:<br>  Pro / Contra<br>  also: fürs Bleiben / gegen das Bleiben<br>  und spontan deine Gedanken dazu eintr?gst.<br>  <br>  Parallel dazu k?nnen dir Entspannungsübungen helfen (z.B. autogenes Training, Muskelentspannung nach Jacobson - das kann man auch gut zwischendurch am Arbeitsplatz machen - und Atemübungen).<br>  <br>  hilfreich kann auch sein, in die Offensive zu gehen, also die Kollegen anzusprechen z.B. in der Art wie: ich bin ja noch so neu hier und m?chte mich einfach orientieren, gut einpassen, bitte helfen sie mir und sagen sie mir ganz offen, wo ich etwas besser  oder anders machen k?nnte.<br>  (MERKE: NICHT sagen "wo ich etwas falsch mache", da das negativ besetzt ist, sondern "wo ich etwas besser machen k?nnte" -> positiv denken und sprechen).<br>  <br>  Es kann ja durchaus sein, dass du nur DENKST, dass die Kollegen (negativ) denken ... es also gar nicht stimmt. Wenn du nicht mit ihnen sprichst, wirst du nie die Wahrheit erfahren.<br>  <br>  (Die Story mit dem Hammer kennst du wohl ... da will sich einer vom Nachbarn einen Hammer leihen und grübelt, ob der Nachbar ihm diesen wohl leiht. Er verstrickt sich immer mehr in die Gedanken, dass der Nachbar es wohl nicht tun würde, ihn ja noch nie leiden konnte etc. ... so geht er zum Nachbarn und klingelt (noch immer irgendwie mit dem Vorsatz sich den Hammer zu leihen) und schreit ihn an, als dieser die Tür ?ffnet: Ihren d?mlichen Hammer k?nnen sie behalten ! ...)<br>  <br>  Helfen kann dir auch, bevor du zur Arbeit gehst, etwas Aufbauendes zu lesen (Kurzandacht o. ?.), um mit positiven Gedanken auf die Arbeit zu gehen.<br>  <br>  Vor allem auch der Gedanke: <br>  Ich tue hier meine Arbeit.<br>  Ich setze mich ein.<br>  Ich mache meine Arbeit gut. <br>  Mehr nicht. Das ist alles.<br>  <br>  also Gedankenfokus weg von den Kollegen, was sie denken ...<br>  Es geht um deine Arbeit und dass du sie gut machst.<br>  Du hast diese Arbeit studiert / gelernt und du KANNST sie, bist sicherlich gut darin.<br>  Also ...|`|662c8e5304fd84bb8bdd8201c6a6c2c0aa	hi,kannst ja mit deine freunde mal darüber sprechen.fühle ich frei,weil nur du kannst machen,was du m?chtest.|`|7557aadc818646696e78acfb9fc5935caa	Die Vermutung dass sie sich beobachtet fuehlen, trifft nur auf sie zu.

Das vorweg.<br>  Andererseits  denke ich du l?ufst vor der Verantwortung davon. Geh tief in dich und überlege warum du Lehrerin werden wolltest. War es nicht das Gefühl Kindern etwas beibringen zu wollen. Sie wachsen und Reifen zu sehen? Wenn du zur Arbeit gehst, ist es da nicht das Lachen der Kinder das dich wissen l?sst das du das richtige tust?<br>  Natürlich musst du deinen Kollegen erstmal beweisen wer du bist und das du das was du machst kannst.

Meine Mutter ist Grundschullehrerin - da habe ich im Laufe der Jahre eine Menge zu h?ren bekommen...<br>  Ich wei?, dass hier bei uns in NRW sehr viele kleinere Schulen -auf Grund des Schülerrückgangs- geschlossen werden. Im Hinblick auf diese Tatsache lohnt es sich definitiv um seinen Posten zu k?mpfen.<br>  Besinne Dich auf Deine Qualit?ten!<br>  Besinne Dich darauf, was Du alles realisieren wolltet und auf den Grund, warum Du Lehrerin werden wolltest.<br>  Engagier Dich um die, um die es eigentlich geht - um die Kinder! Wenn die Dich lieben, hast Du schon eine Menge gewonnen. Bring sie auf Deine Seite - dann hast Du deren Eltern ratz fatz genau so hinter Dir.<br>  Fehler passieren - sieh sie ein.

Grunds?tzlich ist das aber in jedem Job so-das man ja sein K?nnen beweisen m?chte und Vertrauen schaffen will. (Man denke nur mal an junge ?rzte usw.) Wenn du siehst das es dir mit Sicherheit nicht alleine so geht-wirst du auch wieder selbstbewu?ter. <br>  <br>  Bedenke das der Vorg?nger mit Sicherheit auch Fehler & schlechte Seiten gehabt haben wird- denn Nobody is perfect-. Ist ja klar das man davon als Neuling erstmal nichts erfahren wird- im Prinzip wie oft <br>  bei<br>  einer Beziehungs-Trennung oder wenn jemand gestorben ist- das sch?ne und Gute steht erstmal im Vordergrund und nicht die Macken der Person.<br>  <br>  Du wirst genau wie er- gute und weniger gute Eigenschaften haben-denn du bist ja nur Mensch! ;-)<br>  <br>  Suche auch das Gespr?ch mit deinen  Kollegen und spreche offen-aber bestimmt-über deine Unsicherheiten und das diese daher rühren das du das Gefühl hast unter Beobachtung zu stehen. <br>  <br>  Eventuell lassen sich so auch Missverst?ndnisse aus der Welt r?umen- denn oft meint man auch nur das alle einen kritisch be?ugen und setzt sich selbst unter Druck.<br>  <br>  Wie verhalten sich denn deine Schüler? Frage Sie doch mal nach Ihren Wünschen-was einen guten Lehrer für Sie ausmacht, ob sie sich bei Dir wohlfühlen-ob sie sich etwas anders wünschen-mache eine Aufgabe daraus ;-) und hole dir Feedback.<br>  <br>  Durch solche Gespr?che zeigst du dein Engagement, Selbstbewu?tsein und St?rke-das du nicht davon rennst sondern sich deiner Aufgabe stellst und ja auch kritikf?hig und für Anregungen offen bist.

Das soll nicht  hei?en, dass immer alle Kinder brav sind, h?flich sind, grü?en und nie was vergessen (-w?r zwar sch?n, ist aber nirgends so). Mit welchen Argusaugen du von den Kollegen be?ugt wirst, soll dir weniger wichtig sein. Dass ein renommierter, ?lterer, allseits beliebter Lehrer wahrscheinlich um die 40 Jahre Zeit gehabt hat um so zu werden, wie er sein m?chte, darf man nicht übersehen. Er war bestimmt nicht von seinem ersten Unterrichtstag an genau so beliebt wie an seinem letzten. Auch als Lehrer muss man in den Beruf hinein wachsen und man darf sich auch Fehler zugestehen, die letztendlich jeder macht. Ab und zu soll man halt aus dem einen oder anderen Fehler was draus lernen:-) . Zur Beruhigung: auch deine Kollegen haben Fehler gemacht, von denen du vllt. nichts wei?t, aber auch sie kochen nur mit Wasser.<br>  <br>  Ich wei? jetzt nicht, wie sehr emotional belastend du deine momentane Situation empfindest, mein "Fern-Diagnose"-Tip w?re, dich mal durchzubei?en, nicht gleich zu kündigen. Die Schulbeh?rden "merken" sich solche Dinge sehr gut. Es k?nnte schwierig werden, in einer anderen Schule zu unterrichten.<br>  <br>  Vielleicht hast du die M?glichkeit Supervision in Anspruch zu nehmen?|`|d674dac9d4b9fd4bfc9d4921f1960a73aa	ich glaube draculady,da hast du ein problem,das nur du allein l?sen kannst|`|9ce6029ee7fdcaafb2d85ecc292b0f5daa	Das ist immer so wenn jemand neu ist wird derjenige immer Scharf beobachtet.<br>  Also beiss die Z?hne erst mal zusammen aber wenn es gar nicht mehr geht ist es besser zugehen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Alle Rechtschreibfehler sind gewollt,he he|`|2c759cbf6fdc4dae89d093303646677daa	Nicht verunsichern lassen und Dir vor allem was zutrauen! <br>  Selbstbewusstsein verschafft Dir auf Dauer Respekt.<br>  <br>  Bring einfach frischen Wind rein, dadurch da?

Eine unbefristete Stelle bekommst Du so schnell vielleicht nicht wieder. Die Vor- und Nachteile einer Dorfschule kann ich mir gut vorstellen. Auf einem Dorf geht manches etwas langsamer, und jeder muss sich erst mal mit der neuen Situation anfreunden. Die N?he ist gro? und Vorverurteilungen k?nnen schnell passieren. Versuch Deine Schüler mehr für Dich zu gewinnen, und zeig Dein Engagement. Fehler macht jeder mal. Dass die Kollegen Dich erst einmal etwas argw?hnisch beobachten, ist auf einem Dorf v?llig normal, und wird von selbst verschwinden, je mehr Du Dich integrierst und je mehr Freude Du daran entwickelst, Deinen Beruf auszuüben. Ich würde nicht klein beigeben, sondern mich richtig vorbereiten, zu den Kollegen immer freundlich sein, und sie vielleicht auch mal zum Kaffee an einem Samstag zum n?heren Kennenlernen einladen. Vielleicht kannst Du auch mal für alle zur Mittagspause ein paar Kaffeestückchen mitbringen. Dass Du nun einen ?lteren und beliebten Lehrer ersetzen musst, ist sicher nicht einfach, aber Du bist eben ein anderer Mensch, und Du wirst dieser Situation nur gewachsen sein, wenn Du es schaffen willst und an Dich selbst glaubst. Du k?nntest auch in ein paar Monaten eine wahnsinnige beliebte Lehrerin sein, und der alte Lehrer ist vergessen, das hast Du selbst in der Hand.<br>  Ich wünsche Dir viel Kraft und Mut dafür, und ich bin überzeugt, Du kannst das schaffen!

Upon completion the title company will ensure that the deed is properly recorded at the county court recorder's office.<br>  This method is a bit more expensive, but is well worth the expense in the long run.<br>  <br>  Check your closing documents from when you purchased the property, see if you can find the title company that handled your title work for you, call them they might do a courtesy signing for you. At that rate all you would  have to pay for would be the recording fees whatever they might be.

If not I would suggest a criminal investigation and demanding that your bank admit in writing that they dont know what the fee is.  Usually "Misc withdrawal" is done by the bank itself to collect user fees.  As I seriously doubt you have checking account options totalling in excess of 200USD/month, then either somebody is stealing from you or your Bank is lying to you and rigging the overdraft fees themselves.<br>  <br>  Especially if it's Bank of America, those bastards are NOTORIOUS for stalling on your deposits and playing a juggling game with charges and fees.  You could deposit a check on monday and if their fees come on thursday, they will seriously just sit on your check, overdraft your account and steal that money from the check whose money you should have had by Tuesday.|`|27931cab9c9b6468576c4dd3ce8f22b8aa	bank fees

If you are looking for an 'affluent' area, Glastonbury is right next to Manchester and it's a nice town.  Also, the towns west of Hartford (West Hartford, Avon, Canton, Simsbury) are all known as 'safe' and affluent communities.  They may be somewhat boring and very white/Jewish but they are good towns to live in.<br>  <br>  If you mean you want to live by the shore than the commute really isn't that bad to Manchester.  Old Saybrook, Old Lyme and Essex great coastal towns.  Essex is a bit pricey (especially if you want a house on the water) but it was voted #1 on The 100 Best Small Towns in America.  Depending on the route, it's only about 45 min from Manchester.

93dc925a2cf9f82cc4df1f456855ec62aa	In California all persons living in an unit over of age of 18 have to be listed on the agreement.  If one person has bad credit history, prison record, warrants, etc. this can block the other person from getting the unit.  <br>  <br>  Since you have already moved into the unit, the worst things that could happen it the owner will require an additional security deposit based on her poor credit history; if that is the reason why you do not want her name on the agreement. <br>  <br>  If it is because she is receiving welfare payments, well that is another problem.  From my past experience it is always someone who the person knew that finger them, and not the apartment manager.

And the landlord wants all tenants on the lease for legal reasons.<br>  <br>  I work in property management and if we have a tenant that has someone living with them that is not on the lease and that did not apply we would start the eviction process as this is against our lease...so if your landlord is requesting this be done then I'm guessing that's what it says in your lease and you need to abide by this or face eviction.|`|3e03cfeb1ce3e4ed640a6a1c7b02264caa	she might not "have" to be on the lease.

3e03cfeb1ce3e4ed640a6a1c7b02264caa	there are different level of EMT's, depending on how long you are in school for.  The pay is based on what you are specifically qualified to do.  A paramedic is different they are in school longer and as a result start off at a higher pay.<br>  Either way, a government job will always pay more.  So if she gets hired on at a fire station, as an EMT, she will make more, and have better benefits than if she works for a private Ambulance company.<br>  Good Luck to your daughter!

Non posso dire chi sono, ma ho letto parecchie sciocchezze stasera sull'argomento a cominciare dalla storia del brevetto ''americano''.<br>  <br>  Poi dal fatto che sia una novità assoluta. Balle. Nessuno, solo il padreterno per chi ci crede può dire che una invenzione è veramente nuova.<br>  <br>  Gli avvocati generici non servono a niente:la materia deibrevetti è troppo complicata per un avvocato generico. Ci<br>  vogliono avvocati specialisti in proprietà industriale che devono essere assistiti da consulenti in proprietà industriale, solotamente ingegneri, ecc.<br>  <br>  I consulenti son si ''fregano ''le invenzioni per due ragioni:se<br>  avesse senso fregare le invenzioni sarebbero tutti ai mari tropicali a fare la bella vita.....altrimenti se si sapesse in giro avrebbero finito di lavorare.<br>  <br>  L'invenzione può essere la più bella interessante e utile del mondo,ma ci vogliono soldi e tanti per le procedure per uno o più brevetti, prima in Italia e poi all'estero secondo la convenzione di Parigi.<br>  <br>  Naturalmente la Legge Brevetti consente che l'inventore depositi da se una domanda di brevetto, ma questo è del tutto sconsigliabile perche devono essere rispettate tante regole che non sono alla portata del primo venuto. (non è superbia professionale perchè alla mia età fare brevetti mi ha stancato, ne ho trattati troppi e ne ho la nausea)<br>  <br>  Poi una volta o contestualmente alla brevettazione occorre fare una analisi di mercato e il meno indicato è solitamente l'inventore.<br>  <br>  Poi c'è la questione della prototipazione, che anche per un oggetto semplice può richiedere centinaia di migliaia di euro.<br>  <br>  Poi occorre trovare un industriale con un supporto pubblicitario, di vendita, distribuzione.....<br>  <br>  Non so di che si tratti e non mi interessa, ma anche se fosse una cosa apparentemente semplice come l'accendino Bic che ho in mano mentre scrivo i problemi tecnici che ci sono dietro sono enormi.<br>  <br>  Le invenzioni alla Marconi o la supposta invenzione di meucci oggi sono FAVOLE.<br>  <br>  Se solo sapeste che cosa c'è dietro anche ad un cavatappi rimarreste meravigliati.<br>  <br>  In 40 anni ne ho viste di tutti i colori.E pochissimi inventori che hanno ''fatto i soldi'', meno delle dita della mia mano destra.<br>  <br>  Concludendo mai fare le cose da solo: un avvocate che difende se stesso ha per cliente un pazzo e un medico che <br>  cura se stesso è un aspirante suidica.<br>  <br>  Occorre affidarsi a persone del mestiere.<br>  <br>  In bocca al lupo......<br>  <br>  <br>  ---------------------<br>  per spock<br>  <br>  guarda presunzione a parte non sono il primo venuto. Brevettare in america è molto peggio dal punto di vista monetario. Inoltre per la legge brevetti Italiana è proibito per un residente in italia brevettare direttamente all'estero la propria invenzione se non è stato chiesto il nulla osta alla Sezione Militare Brevetti a via Molise a Roma, oppure se non sono passati 90 giorni dalla data di deposito in Italia.<br>  <br>  Inoltre un brevetto americano NON viene esteso direttamente in Italia: questa è una fandonia. Occorre fare un deposito nazionale in Italia eventualmente rivendicando priorità ai sensi della convenzione di Parigi (12 mesi dalla data di deposito in america).<br>  <br>  Dire che ''il consulente italiano'' è fesso richiede una certa faccia. Ripetro che non posso fare il mio nome. sono troppo conosciuto in Italia e all'estero e il mio nome è su internet<br>  come professionista iscritto all'albo dei consulenti italiani in proprietà industriale ed inoltre mandatario autorizzato davanti all'ufficio brevetti europeo.<br>  <br>  Quindi o sei un mio collega alla pari oppure devi stare a quello che dico !!!!

nSxwBvZjaa	BGH: Auch ein abstraktes Schuldanerkenntnis schützt nicht immer vor Einwendungen<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   <br>  Ein abstraktes Schuldanerkenntnis stellt eine selbst?ndige Anspruchsgrundlage dar, deren Geltendmachung unabh?ngig von den Rechtsbeziehungen, die zur Abgabe des Schuldanerkenntnisses geführt haben, m?glich ist. Das hei?t aber nicht, dass das selbst?ndige Schuldverh?ltnis von den zugrunde liegenden Rechtsbeziehungen v?llig unabh?ngig ist. Diese stellen vielmehr in der Regel die causa für die Abgabe des Schuldanerkenntnisses dar. Somit ist grunds?tzlich bei Wegfall oder bei Nichtbestehen der causa ein Anspruch aus ungerechtfertigter Bereicherung (§ 812 I, II BGB) gegeben.<br>  <br>  Dies musste sich ein Rechtsanwalt, der sich von einem Mandanten für seine Gebührenforderungen ein Schuldanerkenntnis über 144.486,- DM hatte geben lassen, vom BGH sagen lassen. W?hrend das OLG der Ansicht war, die Einwendungen des Mandanten gegen die Gebührenforderung seien damit unbeachtlich, betonte der BGH in der Entscheidung, dass die Abgabe eines abstrakten Schuldanerkenntnisses für sich noch keinen Einwendungsausschluss bezüglich des Anspruchs aus § 812 I, II BGB darstellt.<br>  <br>  Ein derartiger Einwendungsausschluss kommt allerdings dann in Betracht, wenn zwischen den Parteien Streit oder Unklarheit über den Anspruch besteht und die Parteien unabh?ngig von diesen Ungewissheiten eine klare Rechtslage schaffen wollten. Solche Anerkenntnisvertr?ge wirken wie ein Vergleich. Dafür fand der BGH hier keine Anhaltspunkte.<br>  <br>  stud. iur.

6cbDEokcaa	I had the same dilemma...<br>  <br>  What you first need to consider is your current business split between Domestic and Commercial customers.<br>  <br>  Domestic customers dont benefit either way if you are vat registered or not, but your commercial customers will immediately find you more competitive on price as they can claim back the VAT element of your bill. If you want more commercial work being registered will be a help.<br>  <br>  You then need to calculate what percentage of your current turnover is costs and profits. If more than 50% is costs like fuel, leasing, vehicle costs etc, that you can claim back the VAT on then it may pay to get registered.<br>  <br>  Businesses that are nearly all labour costs like a plasterer with small materials and fuel costs do not suit being Vat Reg if they can keep below the threshold and mainly do domestic jobs.<br>  <br>  My business was 50% costs and 50% gross profit and I did 10% commercial and 90% domestic work. When I went Vat Reg (as I reached the threshold), I found I only had to put up my prices by just 5% (e.g.￡100 upto ￡105 inc VAT) to keep making the same profit on each job. In other words my prices didnt have to go up by 17.5% as I was now able to claim back VAT on suppliers bills, fuel, subcontractors bills, stock etc. The real benefit was that I was immediately about 10% cheaper  for the same service to my Commercial customers, despite my price rise, and was able to gain more of that work changing my business split to 30% commercial instead of 10%.<br>  <br>  This is my experience, you will need to do your own sums and get advice from an accountant before you make your decision... As long as you are ontop of your accounting/book-keeping and are able to be strong willed about creaming off the VAT portion of your profits to save them for each quaterly VAT bill, then you should be ok...<br>  <br>  The VAT MAN is the first 'Bill' you pay as he is the most ruthless if you default or get it wrong!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT...<br>  Well spotted Rosemary... I missed the Ltd bit of the question, but you covered it superbly!|`|STYhiMEyaa	Adam B's answer is very good on VAT.  You can register voluntarily for VAT right from when you start up.  It means that you don't have to increase your prices when you reach the VAT threshold and you can claim back the VAT on your fuel, which being a considerable part of your expenditure, is probably worth it.  (We've done it with all our businesses.)<br>  <br>  You also ask about becoming a limited company.  If you're trading business to business, being a limited company can make you appear to be more like your potential customers.  People like doing business with people like them.  The setting up procedure is not too difficult.  You can do it yourself by buying the Mems and Arts forms from a legal stationers and getting your Company Secretary to swear an Oath at a Commissioner for Oaths.  It can cost as little as ￡50, all done.<br>  <br>  You do have to submit accounts to Companies House every year but you or your accountant can apply for small company exemption so you don't have to submit full accounts and you also don't have to have them audited.<br>  <br>  We run two limited companies and don't find the administration of them a burden.  The Companies House website has a lot of useful information on setting up a limited company.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new business!|`|AMa6ZSKzaa	there companies which you can rent cars from they'll suite you best for your business|`|AA11238296	I would go VAT registered if i were you, it means you will have to pay VAT on all sales but your can claim back any VAT on anything purchased through the business i.e. petrol/diesel, computers, vehicles (vans not cars).<br>  <br>  Being a limited company means you as an individual arent personally responsible to pay the businnesses liabilities i.e. if the business goes under you wont have to sell your personal assets (house, car, jewellery etc).

YU8e6TZ7aa	You should keep them for at least 5 years or even up to 7 years because the IRS can go that far back and ask you for proof of purchase or receipts for discounts and tax deductions and also in case you lose a check or anything else from the bank and if you have a statement that was given to you at the time and you have saved it then the bank can replace it for you. The primary reason to keep statements and receipts is for proof.<br>  <br>  -Nick|`|btYXpJyKaa	In a nutshell - its best to keep them as long as u can find  the sufficient space, and after that ..well make some more space.

AA11489236	It depends on what shipping method you are using, your location and where you are sending the money order.  For instance, I live in a small town in Washington.  If I were mailing a first class letter to someone in Portland, Oregon it would probably arrive at its destination in only one or two days because my mail gets sent from my post office to the main hub in Portland to be processed.  If I were mailing a letter to New York though, it could take 7 days or more because it would go through more than one processing center.  It also depends on the proximity of the location you're mailing it to the main processing station.<br>  <br>  If you are mailing a letter somewhere far away from you and you want it to arrive in 3 days or less you can mail it in a priority mail envelope and it will get handled faster than first class letters (costs $4.85).  <br>  <br>  Another important factor in having your letter arrive in a timely manner is having the address written clearly on the envelope and correctly.  Most mail that gets sent to the wrong place is because it was sloppily or incorrectly addressed.|`|AA10275738	They should have it by now.

I do think that you would qualify for disability and I wonder why you have not claimed it; you would be able to get SSDI - Social Security Disability. Since it seems like you have worked a lot for your entire life and have paid a lot into SocSec, you should qualify for a decent amount per month. You are clearly disabled. You could then get medicaid if your monthly income was low enough. If it is not, there are ways around that by setting up durable medical trusts; disability attorneys can help you put that into place. <br>  I suggest that you begin by applying for disability at your local Social Security office. Your MD should be more than happy to assist you with this. You will most likely be initially denied and have to reapply; this process will take a few months, maybe several, but don't give up, and you should succeed.<br>  I hope you have the best of luck, and lots of loved ones to help you.<br>  And be sure to vote for Obama!<br>  I hope this helps a little.|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	Yes i would say you do but you need to file right away.

Ia2fXKRxaa	You do not need to register your SSN.  As you get credit (such as credit cards and loans) the lenders will report your timely payment (or lack of) to the three credit bureaus.  This will then increase or decrease your credit score.  It just takes time to build a credit history.  You say you already have a credit card, so your history is already building.  It is also possible that your SSN is just so new, they were unable to find it yet.  Wait a week or two and try again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3PclIflFaa	You can build a credit rating by getting a credit card and always paying it off on time (preferably in full each month).  When you pay the credit card balance in full by the due date, you never get charged any interest.  If the bank won't give you a credit card, try getting a store credit card (Sears, Home Depot) as they are sometimes more relaxed about checking your credit history.<br>  <br>  You can also get a small loan, and then pay it back right away (with the money you got for the loan).  Although this sounds sneaky, it's perfectly legal.  All your credit report will say is that you had a loan, and you never defaulted on a payment.<br>  <br>  Consumer Debt is a huge problem in the USA,as companies will happily give you money to spend even if you can't afford it.  Please be careful -- only spend what you can afford to.|`|jgBHC28Taa	I can set you up on a program that will get your credit score t perfect credit in 90 days or less.

A lot of places will look at your credit history.  If you don't have any credit, good or bad, then they may not approve you.  If you have had an account in the past that you have made payments on and paid it off...that looks good on your credit report.|`|GCf4aOInaa	If you don't have any credit history, they may just flat out refuse you. It's only AT & T and not a mortgage so they're likely to ask for a deposit. Say $200 just in case you default on your payments.
DisdrG4Taa	Please see my answer to the other question, as I answered this there.<br>  <br>  You can always work as a phlebotomist whichever route you choose.  You can become an RN and make a better income, and then decide whether being a PA or NP is the best choice.<br>  <br>  However, the career field is nurse practitioner, not practitionist.|`|AA10685564	If you need to work while in school, then take the phlebotomist classes. The skills you learn will help in either a PA or RN program.<br>  It would take you less time in school to get your PA than it would if you go RN and then Nurse Practionist. For the PA you would need a 4 year degree and then a 2 year PA program. For the NP, you would need a 4 year RN (BSN), then obtain your Masters and then a NP program. <br>  Again if you need to work, it wouldnt hurt to get a 2 year RN (ADN) to support yourself while you continue your education.|`|77nXhS8naa	Nurses are  fantastic, so many of them give up so much, just so that they can look after for others.

It works in stages and you make draws (cash withdrawals) from the bank after each stage is completed. <br>  <br>  You need a contractor and mechanic lien document need to be prepared by a licensed attorney. The documents consist of Mechanic Lien Contract between buyer and contractor; The mechanic lien note (between buyer and contractor) and then Note Transfer, Transferring the note from the Builder to the Bank that will finance the house when it is completed. (Whom ever is giving financing the construction for you)  You will probably need too, the Affidavit of Completion, This is to be filed after the construction has been completed. This is normally prepared with the mechanic lien documents or by the title company that handles the transaction. You may need to see if there is a requirement for the builder is registered with  your state. To make sure the builder is qualified. <br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>

osZ5zVEDaa	I would suggest a prepaid Visa card. If you are coming up in the Chex system then you are pretty screwed. All banks use it or some form of it. <br>  <br>  Sorry Ms. Jackson.. whoooo.. I am for real... <br>  <br>  Couldn't help myself with that last bit.
iNqOsh1Naa	It is the collection company your account has been referred to, not Citigroup, that obtained a judgment. So many people right now are defaulting that the best solution is not to avoid the problem. Talk to billing at the cc company and explain your situation. Request a very low payment plan with a moratorium on the interest. Most cc companies will be happy to work with you rather than lose everything you owe them. Might not work at this late stage, but definitely worth a shot. I know how you feel. I lost my job of 14 years last August and am sill out of work. Good luck.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	They can only reposes items that were purchased on the credit card. They are very unlikely to do that unless there are some large ticket items that they think they can sell to recoup their losses. <br>  <br>  The judgment just serves as legal proof that you do owe the debt. The bank can have the courts garnish your wages but since you aren't working right now that's not really an issue. They won't take your tax refund for a private debt.|`|qpYyGd5Gaa	Joe, I too live in NC. My closest friend owed 10,000 to Citi for an unsecured debt that she couldn't repay. They took her to court and she attended the hearing. The judge reduced her debt to $5,000 dollars because they were in a small claims court. Citi couldn't sue for more than 5k because it was a small claims court. In NC, they can't garnish your wages as that is the law. So, do not be concerned as others have said with them taking your paycheck. It won't happen in NC. What ended up happening to her was the court ordered a payment amount for her and she is required to pay monthly on the debt until it is paid up to $5,000 which will be considered "in full". They didn't take any of her stuff. I'm not sure if your situation will be different, but this is what happened to her with the same financial company. Good luck!|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Credit card companies won't really come repo your posessions. What they would do is continue building interest off your debt until the max alotted in your contract. Then if they still can not collect any payment they will sell your debt to a collection agency at a reduced cost who then will bug you non-stop. I've had collectors contact family and friends as well. Then if they can not collect then they will sell off your debt to another company, so on and so on. They have no interest in your stuff because they don't want to sell used items like a pawn shop, they just want your money.|`|IPfHpkUwaa	Only a Texas judge can do that. And new national laws prevent even that. the answer is NO!! they cannot. As the first person said it is<br>  possible with a judgment to go after your paycheck (if the employer allows it) They can decline if they so choose. They can attach bank accounts and other sources of cash and or liquidity.Going after a federal refund is tricky but a state refund should be quick work for them.Hope this helps.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	They can have you wages garnished, tax refunds seized.  If they can identify what was bought on the CC, then the can send the sheriff, but highly doubtful.
