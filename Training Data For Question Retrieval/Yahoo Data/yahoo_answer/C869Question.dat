20090220220715AAsr4gC	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	Is a Series 7 necessary in my situation?	i work at a branch office of a broker/dealer. i'm an administrative assistant where i help registered reps, OSJ, and branch office manager (my boss) with paperwork and trading via internet. then there's compliance (from our home office) where the OSJ depends on us girls (assistants) to know everything on our office's behalf. the assistants actually know more about compliance than the boss because they rely on us to comply.       the OSJ/boss also requires us to get a Series 7 and Series 24 later on. we are non-producing employees only. we only serve this branch office. we do not make any trading decisions. full-timers get paid around $3,000/month.       do you think it's necessarily for the assistants to get licenses? do you think if we do get a Series 7 and 24 that we are basically getting underpaid for what we are worth (roughly $3,000/month)?

The DOW is now 7300.       I have been investing max in my 401k, mutual fund investments, etc as before in this downturn. My rational is that I am buying low and I currently do not need the money as I am still employed and have a good savings acct. I however am not sure I should keep doing this. I have also been adding money to a couple of mutual funds I own and my sons 529 plan on a recurring basis every month. (Note: Still losing money in them as well).       My balances are 50% less than my initial investments in totality of all my investments (401K, roth, etc). Not sure what to do. Should I continue investing as its low and it can get better? Or any other alternatives? Do you think it is wise to move everything into a stable fund yielding just 1%? What would you advice on selling funds that are sellable (non-IRA funds) in this market? Thank you for your help

20090220174309AAdXIDt	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Why didn't I get the job?	I recently interviewed twice for a job.  During the first interview they asked my salary expectation.  They wouldn't give me salary range information when I asked, so I gave them a number that I based on research and my experience and told them I was willing negotiate.  Afterwards they invited me in for a second interview.       Ultimately, the employer didn't give me the job because they said my salary expectations were too high.  Sounds reasonable, but here's the strange part.  The day after they notified me, I came across the same job posting that they had posted the morning they told me my expectation were too high, and the posting gave a salary range that I was only slightly above.  When they said I was too high, I gave them another number that would have put me in the middle of that range.  All of this makes me believe that salary wasn't the reason they didn't offer me the job.      Why wouldn't they just be truthful about telling me why I didn't get the job?  The interviews, I thought, went very well and the HR person even said that she got very positive feedback from everyone.  The job is still posted and has been reposted on job sites since I got the denial.  So, it doesn't look like there was anyone else in the running.        Any ideas?? Do you think it was really salary or something else?  I am really scratching my head over this.

I came to USA with a visa F1 almost 4 years ago. It is going to expire May 30 (I am going to graduate high school). I have a SSN and driving license.       Some months ago I decided to work for a while at a fast food restaurant and then I discovered I wasn't supposed to work, and so I quit. Now it is tax time, and people are saying that if I file taxes I will get deported for working, and if I don't file them I will get deported for not filing them.      I am engaged to an American natural born citizen and we plan marrying in April. I am pregnant and my due date is supposed to be May 30 (right when my visa expires!) This wouldn't be such an issue if it wasn't for the working thing, because I can get visa extensions to stay longer.      I don't want to get deported or leave, because my baby will be a US citizen, in fact, I won't even be able to leave, because I will be 9 months pregnant at the time.      Could they deport me after having the baby? What should I do? Can I file my taxes next year when I am already a resident, since I am 17 years old right now? HELP!

I'm trying to form a debate on this topic right now with a client. They want to have a tangible piece of information to hand out to potential clients/donors in the form of a CD because they think that if someone has it readily available to them they will look at that before they would access a website.      I feel like handing a CD to someone is almost like saying, "Here. You throw this away." Where would you put a CD when given to you? Where do you store something like that after you receive it?      If it were some form of card that possibly was conceptual, or married the style between itself and the site, wouldn't you feel more comfortable. You can access a site anywhere, designers could update content proficiently and easily. It would take 1/4 of the time it would to open the CD. There is no waste, it carries a low overhead, and you could reproduce them almost on demand.      Opinions please! If you have a useful link I would greatly appreciate that.

20090220221737AAOIjUJ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How do I get money back from a roommate that is moving out that has outstanding rent and utility bills?	My landlord has told me that my roommate hasn't paid the rent for about two and a half months and that he is evicting us from the home. The setup that we had was that my roommate would pay the rent and the utilities because his name was on the lease and I wrote out checks or sometimes paid cash to cover these costs directly to him. I have receipts from him that I directly paid him money for rent and utilities. He was the roommate manger in a sense but he has fell behind on these bills and now is moving out of the house. So now I'm stuck with unpaid rent and utilities and I'm ready to get a lawyer but I'm not sure If I should go to small claims or get an attorney?

One thing I havn't been able to get removed is a judgement against me.  So i wanted to ask has anyone tried to remove judgements. I've been working on it this whole time, and they always verify it and close the request.  Has anyone had any success?      Please... no negative comments.  Dont tell me 'its not right to challeng an account or it wont work if it's actually my account.'  I'm not looking for a guilt trip, and I've already got them removed.       Just need this pesky judgement removed. :-(
