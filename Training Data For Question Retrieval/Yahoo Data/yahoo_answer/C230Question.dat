20090128183334AAkgNOj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anyone else have this trouble with eating with their child?	My daughter is 14 months and meal time has become a game. I used to be able to get dishes done while she was eating her meals, etc.       Now she takes about 3 bites and throws everything else on the floor. She has no interest in using a spoon...just her fingers. Then her hands go straight into her hair. No problem...except the doctor has suggested she not get a bath everyday because her skin is so dry (same as me when I was a child) She freaks when you put a bib on her and rips it off...making more of a mess then if I just let her mess her clothes a bit.       I'm assuming its just a phase as she is a little devil child lately =) Into everything, etc.       Just wondering how other mommies got through it. I feel like pulling out my hair by the end of most days lately. Let me know...thanks!

20090128183827AAxdIE8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do i have to do the dna test?	i am 19yrs old and have a 7 month old son. his "father" is not a parent and a horrible horrible person. because i was on medicaid, families first, and food stamps when i was pregnant the state is making me fill for child support. the first court date to set child support was at the beginning to december. he asked for a dna test and we are scheduled to go back the 9th of February. when the date came for me and the baby to go to the dna test i was "sick" i called and they said they would reschedule it. okay so my reason behind not wanting the dna test or the child support is: when he is reassured that he is his then he will start coming around and we don't need him in our liefs at all. ((he raped me repeatedly 3 weeks after i had my son and i had stitches btw)) and if he has that it will be easier for him to file for visitation and stuff. and he has no job so i wont be gettin much anyways. so my question is what can they do to me if i don't go to the dna test? and it never went in front of the judge. oh and my new boyfriend ((actually we dated before but just got together)) not only loves cares and helps me with my son but so does his whole family so he wont grow up without a father.      i never filed a polive report   i dont need nor want child support or benifits   and he signed the birth certificate   and its all in tennessee

20090128184342AAUV7nY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why do some Yahoo mommy's come on here, and ask for important medical advice, instead of calling their doctor?	I don't get it!  I come on here and ask opinions on petty things, like what diaper do people prefer, what are your nap schedules, things about other mothers experiences with their children.  Never would I come on the computer and waste time if I thought my child was seriously sick, or hurt!  I have seen more than a few questions where the situation is serious, and they are wanting advice from people over the computer!  Why does it seem like no one calls a doctor?  What would be the reasoning, that would keep a person from calling their doctor when they're child's health is at risk?  Now I'm not talking when a child is sick with a cold, and someone wants to know ways to comfort their child, or for more info on an issue that has already been addressed by a doctor, but some serious issues!  I'm not going to repeat the question I just read that made me think of this, because I don't want to put that person out there, as she isn't the only one!  Are mothers afraid to "bother" their doctor, or that they'll be wasting the ER's time?  I just don't get it!!

I work in a daycare, and some new clients came in today....a 4 year old girl named Lorelai, and 2 year old tripets (a boy and 2 girls), Jess, Lane, and Paris.

20090128185959AAuVHDN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How many days is too much to miss from school in first grade?	So we did great until Thanksgiving...then my son gagged in class because that's what he does when he doesn't like something.  Because he "threw up" I came to get him of course, but school policy is that he can't return for 24 hours. He wasn't sick.    Then he missed another day in December, one in January, and then tonight he has a fever of 102.5 so of course he cannot go.    So that is 4.5 days.....at what point will the school start to get upset with me?    I'm a SAHM so I don't mind him being home, and my husband or I have always dropped off his homework...even if I were one of those mom's who'd send in a sick kid, there is a policy fever free for 24 hours and I think 102.5 is pretty significant....if it was like 100 it would be different...    What do you think? I'm very active in the school, Computer Mom, Art Mom, I chair stuff so they know I'm not blowing of his education.

This is my 3rd pregnancy &I will be30 weeks pregnant tomorrow and feel as though the "lightening" has started. Is this normal or too early?          Hey ladies,    For the last week or two Ihave noticed that my bump has changed in shape, Im pretty sure the baby has dropped, Im also walking around like a penguin, haha! Ive been urinating more frequently for the past week, feel alot of pressure & achingin my pelvic area,Ive felt nauseous on/off for a week&havent felt very hungry lately.My baby is still moving around so I know she is Ok.      Im not having any bleeding or Contractions, although ive been having period-like cramping on & off for the last month (prob BH).       I know noone can see what's going on inside, but do these sound like the symptoms of the so-called lightening, or dropping of the baby? And if so, has it happened too early? Has anyone else experienced this? I remember these symptoms with my last pregnancy 4 years ago but im pretty sure they didnt occur til I was almost 9 months & ready to give birth.       thanks all!
20090128185706AAJX0KL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do you think it's kind of irresponsible to have children?	I want to start out by saying that I'm not condemning anyone who's pregnant or who already has children. I know everyone means well and I hope the best for your families. With that said, here are my thoughts lately:      I know a lot of people have really strong faith in God (I'll use Christianity for example), so they assume they know that the afterlife will be ok for them. However, Jesus says that the way is narrow and most people are going to hell. In other words, statistically, you'd be more likely to be raising kindling wood for hell. I know that sounds awful, but seriously, why chance it? Why not just adopt a kid who already exists?      And what if Christianity's not even true and everyone ends up going to some horrible afterlife. Why create more people when none of us truly knows that comes after this? Even if you think you're saved, Jesus talks about how people will come up to Him and say "Lord, Lord" thinking they had been saved when they weren't.       In other words, isn't it a little irresponsible to reproduce when you have no solid basis for what lies ahead, and when most religions specifically state that most people will be tormented for eternity?       Thanks for your understanding.

So when she goes clothes shopping with my brother she'll let him pick out what ever he wants as long as his jeans fit him.   But when I go shopping she hates everything I like, harass me that I'm fat (which I'm not super ultra fat at all) so she make me buy clothes three sizes to big. She gets me to the point of crying.   Or she'll just go out with out me and buy me clothes (which she just did and the clothes aren't nice at all they are pollster and all icky) so i end up just putting it in my closet till we give it off to charity. So I asked her to just give me a couple of dollars and let me shop for myself because I know what looks good on my body and I'm a super smart shopper.      I know it's not because she still thinks of me as her "little girl", I'm just so fed up with this.      So I'm gonna restate my question.   Why is she doing this?

It's on my bedroom floor and over time, even though we wash it, it's gotten gross and matted. Cat hair, fuzz, nail clippings everything gets stuck in it and it grosses me out a lot. My mom asks me why my room is always so mesy, it's because my rug is disgusting! I want to take a break from it for awhile, a.k.a. put it in my closet so I can have a nice clean floor. But I don't know how to tell my mom? She spent a lot of money on this rug and she tends to get a little defensive and upset during things like this.
20090128150621AAHDurI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	In a lot of pain, no blood. Pregnant.?	So yesterday I went to one of my doctors appt that you have to go to every 4 weeks.   Some doctor in training or something was working with my doctor and they asked me if it was ok if she did my check up, and of course I agreed.   I guess she was measuring my belly, and she pushed really hard on it, like it didnt hurt at the time, just really uncomfortable..   When i got home my belly started to hurt really bad.. like to move, cough or get up from when im sitting.   My belly still really hurts, and the pain has kinda of gottn worse.   It didnt help that she had NO idea what the heck she was doing!   I took a Tylenol but that didnt really help any.   Is there something that I could do to help the pain go a way.. like its not sever pain, more anoying then anything.      Thanks.

20090128201449AAdsoZu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My son is almost 8 months old and I still haven't had a real period -- breastfeeding and period question?	LOL, awkward question, but yes..      My son is almost 8 months old and I still haven't had a period! I had two 'spotting' days months ago, but nothing besides that and I wouldn't really even say that was a period.      I'm breastfeeding too, so I know periods are usually delayed -- but how long delayed should they be? Shouldn't I have had a period by now? My overies feel strange this past week.. sort of empty-like, as I felt after I gave birth to my son.      Is this normal or what? Anyone know please?

I used to like him as more than just a friend. But I stopped for a while. Now I'm kinda thinkin' that I like him again. It's just.. everytime I see him I get SO happy. And I just.. ughh I can't explain. I honestly don't know how I feel about him!      So here's my ?:      Have you ever felt this way and what advice can you give me?

Okay, so we used to text, and before hed just stop replying.   later on, hed say bye.      last time we talked we texted til i fell asleep and he always replied whenever i thought he wouldn't.      this is the conversation.   haha, i used a good excuse to talk to him.      Me: Heyy. Whats up?   Him: Nothing much. watching tv   Me: Kewl. Im just waiting for alek to come to my house and need a guy to talk to cuz girl drama stresses me outtt.   Him: oh that sucks for you.   Me: Yeahh. its complicatedd. /:      (at this point I was like-- hes not replying.)      Him: oh with who?   Me: Valentinaa. I'm not mad at her. I'm just mad at her..situation? i guess.   Him: Oh. I understand. that stinks.   Me: lol rly? haha, are you being sarcastic?   (i thought he was joking.)   Him: nahh. its happened before. it does to everyone.   Me: yeah, but you don't have to deal with overly emotional girls who are obviously pmsing.   Him: sure don't but girls do get pissy at me for no freaking reason.   Me: alek says they get pissed for a good reason: theyre bleeding for like a week.   Him: haha shes probably right.         ..      Me: sry my dad was telling lame *** jokes.   Him: haha sounds funny   Me: they're so lame they actually are!   Him: haha wow.   Me: (I told him one joke my dad said. it was a racist one though. and rly lame.)    Him: haha racist person   Me: Nahh. just a racist joke.         and then i fell asleep.      i just hate it how i always start the conversation. hes only texted me once.   we always talk in school and he always turns around at me and we both laugh if someone says something perverted though.         my friends say he wouldnt have txted me about girl drama if he didn't like me.      what do you think? am i over analyzing this?

20090128143314AAvQCda	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby modeling question?	I have an adorable 9 mo old daughter (I know -  all moms says that ).   However, after numerous strangers and relatives asked me if she is   modeling, the idea stuck in my head.  she is, indeed, photogenic, has   beautiful teeth, hair, eyes and a smile and I decide to give it a try.    My question is ?How and where do I start??.  The only thing I have   tried, so far, was to have gone to ?kids.com? - baby talent management   company.  They have asked for $595 upfront and this turned me off.   Later, I googled them and realized they were scammers.  Do I need a   management company (and which ones to avoid) or can I approach   modeling agencies directly?  If so ? which ones and how? Please   provide a thorough answer as I am new to the field and don?t have any   connections.  Perhaps, this is a bad idea and it is impossible to   break into the field without connections?  P.s. My goal is not to make   mega bucks but to see my child?s face printed in some baby magazine   (mom?s vanity - - guilty as charged) and, perhaps, earn small change   to help along while I am between careers.

20090225151725AAzC8mF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents: Growing up did your parents treat masturbation as something normal or was it shunned?	In our family growing up (my parents are very religious Christians) it was looked down on.  My parents discouraged it and said it was a sinful thing.  Now I love my parents and they raised me well.  So I can take that part of their parenting and just not take it into the family I am raising.  That is one thing I highly disagree with my parents on.      I think it's a normal part of adolescence and teenage years.  It's a healthy release of sexual tension without having sex.  I don't believe it to be sinful unless you do it compulsively or it's fueled by unhealthy things.      What are your thoughts?  Was is shunned or accepted when you were growing up?

20090128162818AALLVW8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Do you think this even matters?	I don't think it's that important that the first and middle names of your kid flow together.

And do you think it really matters that much if a kid's first name goes with his/her siblings names? I don't see why that matters much either.

He has always posetted, but for the last few days, he has thrown up at least twice after a single feed.   He's been a little grumpier than usual as well, but still sleeping his regular hours (if anything, he's napping for longer in the dat)   We haven't changed his diet, which is only formula, and we haven't changed the amount he is eating.      He is at bringing his wind up, but I was thinking perhaps he was not bringing it all up, despite the help of wind drops.

But then I get to thinking to much and to me it sounds like the word 'reliable' when said fast.   - i know thats just me being daft heh...      But wat do you guys think?   Which sounds betther:   Lyra Beth   Lyra Belle.         I'd say I'm open to suggestions but I highly doubt I'll like any mentioned as I have pretty much been through EVERYTHING and can't fine one.   I don't like virtue names like Hope, Faith, Grace so if you do suggest just steer clear of these ones thanks.      Thankyou!
20090225151219AALP12W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why doesn't he ever want to talk about it?	My son is 6 years old and in kindergarten and for some reason he never wants to tell us about his day, we ask him what did you do today and he'll say nothing really snotty, ask him like did you color, what did you have for lunch and he'll just get real irritated. Is this normal is it just something that kids do? When he gets home he is usually so tired he's in school from 9am till 3:30 everyday.       Whats going on, did/do you kids act like that?

20090225151200AAlxZXT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Experimenting foods with your baby?	I've recently seen a video on myspace where a mother is letting her daughter taste a lime. She looked maybe 7-8 months old?      Now when I worked in an infant room in childcare. We had parents sign off and taste testing stuff like pudding, frosting, jello. Fun things like that.      Basically this lady got many rude comments on how the baby will never trust her mother with food. the mom did not shove the lime at her, the baby grabbed it.      what's your position on this and why?

20090225150307AALKmTg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	For those who watched the Nadya Suleman (Octomom) interview with Dr. Phil?	I know this topic has been talked about to death and I know many of you are sick of seeing questions posted about her. I myself haven't posted one before now and won't again.      I'm curious what people think after watching this interview with Dr. Phil. This is a long interview for her and she has spoken more then we have heard from her so far (even though she avoided questions). So here's the question.      After seeing this interview has your opinion of her changed, and if so, did it change in a positive or negative way? Don't forget to explain WHY your opinion did or did not change.      Personally, I'm more concerned for her and her children's well being after hearing what she had to say to Dr. Phil's questions. I've been trying to keep my judgment minimal this entire time but at this point I'm convinced that she's not quite playing with a full deck of cards. She seems completely out of it and out of touch with the reality around her. She reminds me of the 13 year old girls who want a baby because they're cute and they think it will be fun. She doesn't seem to have a firm grip on everything. What kills me is she knew early on in her pregnancy that at least 7 babies were on the way and yet she had no real plans to care for them in addition to her original 6. I believe she didn't intend to have another 8 children at once but she knew this was coming way before the babies were born. I know most mothers out there would go into high gear to find some way to build a plan to care for these precious babies. Instead it seems as if she just sat back and let this all happen without doing much thinking about the consequences for her, her children and her family. To me, that is beyond selfish and irresponsible.      I wish the children the best and hope they get the best care possible no matter WHO that is with.      Enough of what I think though. What do you think?      ADDITION: Ironically, Yahoo answers category recommendation for this question was in the "Soap Opera" section. I kid you not!

20090128161917AALkRLn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pro-lifers against abortion unless pregnancy is due to rape don't you defeat your own argument?	If you say abortion is murder then even if the mom was raped she is still a murderer if she kills the life inside her.      When you talk murder you are innocent or guilty.  Is aborting a rape conceived child self defense? ...I think not.       I am pro choice and if I was rapped I would probably carry the baby to term as many pro life women have done.      So please give your take without murderous rage.

20090128171733AALSApY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is most important in your search for childcare?	In your search for a childcare provider, what things are most important to you? I honestly would like to know. I know there are more things than I have listed. Feel free to add your own. Please tell me which things are more important to you and why.       1.    A) Experience - Would you prefer a caregiver to be a SAHM with a couple of decades of childcare experience?   B) Youth - Would you rather a caregiver have the youth and energy of a high school or college-aged student?       2.    A) Your Home - Would you prefer that care be provided in the comfort of your own home?   B) Caregiver's Home - Would you bring your child to a caregiver's home if the care was excellent and the home was clean, safe and fun?       3. If you are open to bringing your child to a caregiver's home...    A) Near - Would you like the caregiver's home to be in close proximity to your own home?    B) Far - Would you be willing to drive 15-30 minutes in order for your child to be cared for by a wonderful and experienced caregiver?       4.    A) Pets - Would you like your child to learn to live alongside pets, to learn to be gentle and care for other living creatures?    B) Would you prefer not to have your child exposed to animals?       5.    A) Licensed/Certified - Would you prefer that a caregiver be licensed or certified by the state or city, having had inspections once in awhile and be able to care for up to 8 children at a time?    B) Unlicensed but Devoted - Would you prefer to tour a caregiver's home yourself and find a caregiver who is devoted to give quality care to only a couple of children at a time?       6.    A) All-inclusive rates - Would you like a simple, reasonable, all-inclusive rate that would include meals, wipes, art supplies and other activities?   B) Varying rates - Would you mind paying one rate for childcare and then bringing meals and paying vacation fees, late fees and fees for extra or later hours?       Once again, these are actual issues that I've seen come up - so I would like input and your opinion on them. Feel free to add any other important issues you may have.

20090225151620AAYoGhS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I need help... please...?	My name is Angela Decker and I am 21 years old.  I turn 22 in March and I live in Lodi California.          My boyfriend Aaron Roth and I both share a home in Lodi California, a cute and clean 1 bedroom apartment and we have a son, Noah Lee Roth, who is going to be 4 months on February 6th 2008.  Noah was born on October 6th 2008 at Lodi memorial hospital.  He is the best thing that has happened to the both of us.       Aaron works at ST. Peters church/school as the maintenance manager. He started December 1st 2008. He loves his job and they love him. Me, I'm a stay home mother, at least I was.       I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 12 years old; the condition came out of nowhere, however it is controlled by medication.          One of the emotions that can trigger an episode of epilepsy: Extreme STRESS and OR Depression.          Aaron is a diabetic and has type1 diabetes. Aaron is insulin dependent, his condition is controlled by this medication and he takes very good care of himself, which enables him to take care of his family, myself and our son Noah.          Prior to meeting Aaron, I was not familiar with the disease (diabetes), however despite our own medical conditions we have been able to live a good quality of life learning a lot from each other.  Some people in the world may feel their different because they have a handicap, I do not feel that way, I feel we are all alike and everyone deserves to be treated fairly and without discrimination.          As a young parent, as some would describe, in my mind being a young parent is actually a blessing.          I also believe in god and that he would not allow me to make such decisions as having a baby if I am not yet ready to do so and I believe babies are a gift from the lord himself.         OUR SON MEANS THE WORLD TO US....  HE'S OUR LIFE....          With that said, I am officially reporting and it should be so noted that on December 20th 2008, CPS took my son away from my boy friend and I, and the events leading up to that action are unfounded and unwarranted.  I am also writing to report the un-professional, disconnected and zero public relations CPS staff has/is demonstrating are appalling and unacceptable.          Myself and family members have been miss treated and treated unfairly by the state agency so named as Child Protective Services(CPS), but above all and most importantly I feel it necessary to report the neglect CPS and perhaps some doctors involved has demonstrated regarding the health and welfare of my son Noah Lee Roth.          Example: My Grandmother is opting to divorce my step-grandfather in effort to maintain the squeaky clean living environment required in hopes to receive custody of Noah form CPS custody.  In short, my grandfather, in his younger days did something very childless, nothing malicious, but apparently against the views of CPS as suitable.  Again we are talking one small issue 30 years ago (streaked across the parking lot on a silly dare).  To think my grandparents divorcing over this is ludicrous as they are happily married and would do anything for their great-grandson.          What happened on December 20, 2008 and noted below will surely prove THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED to me and my family.  My new wonderful life with our son had just begun and was brought to a halt abruptly and perpetuated any parent's worst nightmare.          Noah was 8lbs, 20 1/2 in. Full head of hair and the cutest baby ever. Noah's due date was October 9th.  But he came on the 6th, by a c-section due to my seizures.  We stayed in the hospital for 4 days. When we were discharged Noah was 7lbs 15oz. He had a little bit of jaundice.  But otherwise the doctors sent him home and felt he was ok.          It took awhile for me to heal from giving birth, but Aaron was there all the time, an excited daddy. When Noah made even a peep at night, dad (Aaron) was awake and looking and checking over him.       When Noah was 11 days old (Oct.17, 2008) I made a doctors Appointment, I felt there was something wrong; his right upper eyelid had more redness than normal.  I noticed Noah had been grabbing at it and it looked swollen for 2 days.  I contacted Dr. Stammers' office, we went in for a appointment and they prescribed Noah medication.            Noah is now 2 weeks of age (Oct. 24, 2008) Again, we contacted the Doctor because he had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days.  My niece had a viral gastroenteritis and he was exposed to it, so the Doctor recommended we watch for signs of dehydration.  Again, we were sent home with Noah.          Noah is now 3 Weeks of age. (Oct.29, 2008)  We took Noah back to the Doctor, he was still vomiting, Dr. Stammler stated Noah is ok and healthy.            Noah is now 4 Weeks of age (Nov. 7, 2008), still vomiting after every bottle, so we took him back to the doctor (10-24-08, 10-29-08 and now 11-7-08)  why haven't Dr.Stammler found anything?          We changed his formula to soy milk advised by Dr.Stammler to add a small amount of

How soon after a C-Section can i start trying?   if im having a boy again i have to wait to find out at 36 weeks what im having. they couldn't tell at 20 weeks.. i was thanking of trying for a girl next time around. but i would like to start trying as soon as i can. i do know to ask my Dr. and i will. but i have been dead set on getting my tubes tired this time. around because birth control messes me up to much. so i don't really want to go back on it if i can..i had the iud at one time it was great until i got. sick with it and had to get it out or i wouldnt get better..
20090128184552AA1xgb0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Now I'm getting badgered because I don't spank anymore?	I have come to realize that my anger puts me at risk of losing control if I spank my toddler.  I have spanked him out of anger once and that was the last time I spanked him.  I'm not a "reformed spanker" that is now totally against spanking.  It's just that for me I tend to be more temperamental when my toddler makes me angry (and yes I am seeking counseling for it) and I don't want to risk doing something I could regret.        So I am now sticking to letting my husband doing the spanking if there is an offense that merits one.  He's very good about keeping calm when our toddler misbehaves and is a very responsible disciplinarian.  Spanking is just not something I will do personally but I have no problem with others doing it as long as it is done responsibly and in the proper context.  Spanking is just one more tool of discipline that works for some and not for others.      So why all of a sudden am I getting ransacked because I myself choose not to spank my kids?  I never said I think it's wrong or that others should not do it.  I simply said it's not for me anymore.

20090128192703AADlsYo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this fair, i think its VERY unfair.?	my printer is wifi so u dont need a usb cable. i installed it in my sisters computer cause i helped her [well did her whole] science project and i had to print things from her computer. well she 'accidentally' prints things out. the main reason im mad is cause i have to buy ink and it isnt really cheap. the 1st time she printed her AIM buddy list [3 pages long] and i told my parent and they laugh at me. and today something comes out of the printer  and it was a page from one of my sisters games. i told my mom she goes "i'll take care of it". then i went to my sister and asked her what was it and she acted all stupid saying she had no idea [she said the same thing about her aim buddy list] and my mom goes is she on the phone and i was like yea she is. and my mom flipped out and started screaming and cursing at ME; but when im on the phone my sister can say/do w.e she wants. and my mom also told me she uninstalled my printer out of my sisters computer after the whole aim thing; she obviously lied.         ugh im so mad!   do u think my mom was unfair?      im 16 my sisters 11.      but shes real bad 4 11 like eairler i went to the bathroom n the toilet wasent flushed and i sed who was last in there n it was my sister so i told her go flush it n she said "oh ofcourse bow down to the fat as*"   and then she gives me the finger n curses\ me out but my mom dont care but my sister said i gave her the finger [which i didnt] and i get yelled at.

There is absolutely no medical reason for the induction, all she said was 'we don't like you to go over your due date' and left the room.       The more I think about it, the more I realize how ridiculous it is, and I want to refuse the induction without sounding rude or uneducated in the matter.       How would you handle the situation? The doctor is very fast paced, doesn't stay in the room for long and doesn't take many questions and I need to get the message across quickly but I don't want to be rude.

20090128184518AAfLnWD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My teacher and I have this "thing" going on??? (Dont judge until you read please)?	I am tight with my science teacher and track coach. He was my homeroom teacher in 6th grade, and I befriended him. In 7th grade I had him for spring and winter track and my friends had him as their eighth grade teacher. He is funny and extra nice to me, and we joked around a lot in track but he tried not to show favoritism in front of the team. Now in 8th grade he is my science teacher and track coach, and I go to him at lunch too.We bond so perfect its easier for us to converse in private. eventually we began what im pretty sure is "flirting" I'm POSITIVE its not just joking around. I'm no expert on flirting, but i know it enough, and its subtle like he wants to see if im quick enough to pick up on it.He's been married for 4 years, so I've kept my respectful distance.Hes 28 and last month his wife left him for good and hes really hurt. He came back after taking some time and needed to talk and vent to me one on one more than ever. In bonding we tried to talk about not personal stuff to save pain, but eventually we both talk about our problems and private life, comforting eachother. We are so close, and he's so sweet and I think hes becoming "interested" in me. I don't know if hes always felt like this so strong, or hes just on the rebound, or I'm reading his feelings all wrong and this is all in my head. I REALLY like him, but the school doesn't allow t/s relationships and I've never been involved with anyone before and I don't want him to get in trouble. I've never felt uncomfortable with him but now I'm confused. How can something so right be so strange!!! I wouldn't even know how to bring this up, or if he would approach me first, or wait it out. Please I need help whats my next step!! He's made me feel more special than anyone else, and he likes me for me, but where do I go from here? Am I in love?

20090128191137AAFRCpn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of this?	Do you think a green card holder who got a woman pregnant in the US and moved back to his native country to avoid paying child support school still be able to visit his kid in the USA.  The law says that if he moved out of the country before you could ask for child support, you can’t get any, as long as he does not become a legal US resident.         This means that if he enters the country with a tourist visa he can get court ordered visitation with out paying child support.  That is what the law says.

So me and my boyfriend are talking about having another baby. We already have a 9 month old baby boy. Ever since I had him my periods have been comming on the 10 th of every month and they last 5-6 days. When I start its like a big gush of blood and its really heavy with horrible cramps for the first 3 days or so. This month I started my "period" a few days earlyer and at first instead of just bleeding really heavy it started by barely spotting. It was more like a discharge, not even enough to use a tampon. The next day it was a little heavier and then it spotted and stopped. So it only lasted for 2.5 days. Also I have been very emotional and I pee like every 5 min! I get nactious sometimes now. With my last pregnancy I took like 4 different urine tests and they all came up negitive and then I still felt pregnant so I went to the doctor and did a blood test and I was 6 weeks pregnant. So I went to the doctor around the 19th and took a urine test and it came up negitive. So my question is could I have taken the test too early and therefor got a negitive result? I would love to have another baby so im kind of hoping I took it too early. What do you think?

20090128191756AARucIx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Whats the big deal about?	painting nails      A lot of what I have read on here from tweens/teens and parents that a handful of tweens and teens can't paint their nails.       A lot of the parents think that its a "grown up" thing to do.      When I was 8 or 9, They made Little Mermaid finger nail polish.    THE LITTLE MERMAID   They make sparkly colors with glitter and crap.       I just don't see why any parent wouldn't let their tween or teen girl paint their nails because they thought it was a "grown up" thing, when it really isn't.       Are you one of those parents?   And why?   Are you not one of those parents?   And why?

However had some bra issues. I only have one actual baby/maternity store here and yet they have only a few shirts, like one dress, and a few tank tops and even there tank tops are 55 dollars! And theres nothing special about them! Same with all their other shirts are 55 and up. We have walmart but I have already been looking there just curiously every time i go shopping and they have nothing stylish, Or that would really fit me unless I get a HUGE stomach. I was wondering if anyone knows Any Canadian stores, even Online ones, I look at and shop at for later months?? Or other sites that sell??        as well As lastly, How much did you spend on baby furniture?? And what would you say are the top 5 items you needed, OR wish you knew before U had your baby?

20090128184556AAWS9Pm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	As parents would you pay for a service to find out if your children are using drugs?	I am about 5 years clean from using drugs and would like to take my knowledge about how to recognize the signs, what to look for, even do a home analysis. I could see alarming things most people would never notice when just glancing around a room. I am 33 and at one time have been addicted to or used just about every substance out there and know every trick and sign to look for. I would like to make my mistakes help someone else, somehow. I would be willing to speak to students in a way that they can identify with, showing them all of the reasons to not use drugs that were left out of health class. Not too many people would be qualified to offer such a service, and I know being a new parent myself, that it is of value. If I was, as a parent, interested in such a service I would want references to make sure I wasn't being scammed. Other than that I would consider it priceless to know whether or not my child needed help. Do you all feel the same?   Anyone see fault in the idea? I am a new father and husband that has seen the light and would like to know I somehow made a difference in the world despite my own tainted past. Besides telling me to do volunteer work (which I'd be willing to do, but would find difficult while working full time and raising a family) All opinions welcomed.

20090128191826AAEArql	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When giving birth can the doctor make you have a C section or is it your choice to do it vaginally?	We were just watching :the business of being born: and were wondering if it is the mothers choice whether or not she wants to have a natural vaginal birth. Can the doctor say you need to have a cesarean section just to save time even if the baby is healthy but just taking a while to come out?

Even if I lay her to play on her baby gym, she'll turn around to watch it. I usually let it open just to have some background sound, or to watch it while I feed her or fold clothes. Should I close it? I usually listen to pretty inoffensive stuff (home renovation and decoration, or cooking shows...)

I had my son about 4 months ago and while that is not long at all I have forgotten most of the early signs of a pregnancy ... Did this happen to anyone else?      I have the "classic" symptoms of nausea all day long (had it with my son) head aches (had it) and delayed period...      my stomach is really sore!! and I get cramps in my knees like when I am about to start my period, I also have heart burn and fatigue ...      There is a possibility I could be pregnant again ... and my husband and I love the idea of course if Im not we are okay with that too ...      this is not a question for you to "diagnose" me on if I am pregnant or not .. thats why they invented pregnancy tests ... I just want to know what symptoms you had and if any resembled mine ...      I am especially curious about the sore stomach ... it feels like when my breasts were sore in my last pregnancy but this time in my stomach not breasts ...         no dramatic answers please ... and I will be seeing a doctor but I just want to be sure and wait till my period is over due 1 week .. (I have 3 days so far)

20090128183701AABN6TB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Since becoming pregnant, I feel less attractive?	I am 8 weeks pregnant, and ever since I found out, I have been feeling less attractive. I have also been less interested in sex. My husband and I haven't had sex since I found out I was pregnant, because I am just not interested. I feel terrible for my husband, because we used to enjoy sex on a regular basis. It's not that I feel like he is looking at me differently, I just feel bloated and not into it. Any suggestions on how to get my sex drive back?
20090128184719AAslWxb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding this time around? ?	I know this is partly something I need to get advice on from my ob, and partly a decision I have to make, but I wanted advice on the matter....      When I had my son 16 months ago I had mastitis twice within the first 5 weeks of breastfeeding. First went away with antibiotics, but the second time a week later (other breast) wouldn't go away and just kept getting worse. Long story short, a major abscess developed while I tried antibiotic after antibiotic, and by the time I went to the surgeon I had to have about a cup of green liquid drained out two days in a row (sorry for TMI). The hole that resulted inside was about the size of a tennis ball and took weeks to heal from the inside out. It was way worse than childbirth is the only way to describe it. Point being, the bacteria ended up being MRSA (which my son ended up having as well... we think he got it in the hospital at birth which makes me sick). I finally got on the right prescription and after missing out on a month of his life, we all healed. Life is wonderful now. Ok that's my silly background story...    Now that I'm about to do this all over again I'm so torn. I want to breastfeed so badly, but everyone thinks I'm crazy for even attempting it again. I've seen how formula fed children can end up just as perfect as breastfed children, so I don't see myself feeling guilty like I did last time if it doesn't work out. I guess first of all I don't even know if my right side is even capable of making milk anymore-- do you think the surgery would've affected it in that way? (I'll be asking my doc once I start appointments) Secondly, do you think it's worth it? It was just such a horrific time, and it terrifies me to risk that happening again. I know each child is so different though, and it could be much easier this time around.   Ok, I guess I just needed to vent because this has been on my mind so much. If it was you would you go for it or no? Honest well meaning opinions appreciated :-)

20090128191305AAsXGvO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Just read, I'm in need of some help right now. Ex-boyfriend?	I'll try to keep this short, but I need some help.      I broke up with my ex over the summer. I've known him for 2 years and we'd been dating 8 months when I ended it with him. I was in love with him, but as a couple we weren't good together. We had different opinions on everything including how our relationship should be.      He and I both were having trouble moving on, but as I was making a serious effort to get over him, he was desperately trying to get me back. We both wanted to be friends, mostly because I think my life would be incomplete without him, he's been my best friend since the day we met.   He decided to date his best friend's younger sister, but kept trying to get back with me. I finally decided that I would give our relationship another shot, I told him and we discussed it, he said he wanted that to and had already planned to end it with the new girl.      The problem is, he hasn't ended it. He says it's because he doesn't know how his friend will react. He tells me he loves me, I believe him. And he tells her her he loves her, the problem is, she's the one who he sees in public, who gets to let people KNOW she loves him, who spends all her time with him, and I'm in the background.      I feel used, I can't tell if he's doing it on purpose or not. I know him well, he's a good guy and when I'm with him I know that he DOES have feelings for me still. But when I haven't seen him for a few days and I see that his relationship with her is still going strong and they seem happy, it makes me feel used.      Is there a way I can make this situation better? Should I stop being friends with him? I have a feeling that would make me really upset. I don't know what to do, I need advice, if you want more information and you want to help, e-mail me please.

20090128184642AAKIFN8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Staying home and going to college?	I'm afraid that if I stay home and go to college that I won't have a life. I mean like, waking up, driving to college, going to my classes, coming home doing homework, and probably working.  It would be stupid to just drive there later just to hang out looking for a friend or something. Whereas if I'm living on campus, I'd get to meet people in my dorm, hang around people in my classes more, and hang around places on campus, maybe go to a few parties. I'm probably going to a college that I will have a scholarship with and is the cheapest, which is going to be one close by so most likely I will stay home and go.  But I'm really scared of having like no life and not really getting to meet people since I will basically just be going and coming back...I guess.    Is there anyone who goes to a community college and does not live on campus, and how is your social life compared to those who live on campus?
20090128185446AA8pHDf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why did he say that?	So a little over a month ago, my friend and I were talking on the phone. We were talking about the guy that I like. (she doesn't know that I like him, and she hates him). So the guy's parents are acquaintances with a girl my friend is friends with parents. So my friend's friend asked the guy who I like "Do you know (my name here)?" And he answered "Yes, and she is the most unpopular girl at school!" He said something like that. And when she asked him if he knows my friend (she has a few classes with him) he answered, "No." Then, a few weeks ago, he brought up what had happened, but didn't mention what he said. He always talks to me when he gets the chance, but why did he say that?

20090128185949AAZTEnY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why would a 3-year-old ask questions to which he already knows the answer?	"Is that my _____?" To something he has had since he turned 2.   "What's his name?" Pointing to a well-loved character in a book we've read 100 times. "What does it do?" Asking about an object we've talked about many, many times.   Also, when reading or talking or playing, I'll ask a question, such as, "What does a cow say?" (Not all questions are below his level, this is just an example.) And all of a sudden in the last few weeks, he answers a quick "I dunno."      And no, it's not because he's forgotten. He knows what he's asking about, and knows the answer to the question I asked. Almost always, when playfully probed, he will answer without any hints. So yes, he knows what he's asking or being asked. And he doesn't do it in a playful fashion. If anything, he almost seems annoyed at me not automatically stooping to filling in the blank for him. And that's just what he wants me to do: give him the answers, instead of answering or figuring it out himself.      Why would he be doing this?   Any way to curb it?   Am I doing the right thing in probing 'til he answers?   Any child psychology experts?

20090128184735AACb3Cx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	If a period comes, when can you take a pregnancy test afterward?	So here's a long story. Mail order pharmacy never sent my NuvaRing to me which should have been put in Jan, 7th. By the time Gyno called me back, it had been 3 and half days, then they werent open on the weekends, so by the time i could have actually got a sample from them it would have been 5 and a half days after i was initially supposed to put the NuvaRing in.    So, boyfriend and I had sex on January 10th. used a condom a while before ejaculation, but didn't think about precum...nor thought about plan b pill. On the Jan 18th, had sex again, used condom entire time, but when he pulled out, condom stayed in me. Got nervous, used planb next day asap. since birth control was screwed up by not inserting nuva ring, could egg ovulation be 3 days after?   Had all plan b side effects. nausea, vomiting, just sick-to-stomach-im-tired feeling. Now that it has been 1 week, 2 days later im not as tired as i was before and no longer feeling sick and no longer vomiting. feeling pretty good now, some small backpain (slipped on ice in drive way 4 times in the last week) and last 2 days felt some discomfort in uterus. Got my period today (Jan. 28) the day i was supposed to take out my nuvaring. so my period is actually 2-3 days early. After my period goes away, how long after can i take a pregnancy test? i want to BE SURE i am not pregnant. called gyno, and they wont check me for pregnancy until  a week late, and receptionist got mad for me asking questions. help please?

20090128190148AA68FDu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC for 1 1/2 years could I be pregnant?	Hello,   My husband and I have been ttc for 1 1/2 years and I was wondering if I should take a test now or not?  My husband is a truck driver so that is probably one of the reasons for the negative tests.  Today is Jan 28th and my last period was November.  Here is some maybe symptoms I have.  Very very sleepy all day long all the time has been like this for some time.  Everyday for the past couple weeks I have been having alot of cervical discharge, white/yellow creamy no odor, no itch, no pain.  I have been having more headaches than usual. Breasts are more tender sometimes.  I have missed period.        I have been taking my bbt every morning but i am afraid i don't get up the same time everymorning and i do toss and turn through the night but my hopes of being pregnant was dashed after I started getting what the normal bbt charting says.  Here are my temps   98.96 first time I was so happy cause i thought I was pregnant then 96.75 which made me think my period was coming 97.04, 96.58, 96.92, 96.86, 97.19, 96.92, 97.10, 97.24, 97.16, 97.16, 97.25, 96.89, 97.10, and this morning was 97.23  I started taking the temps on 1/14 to present.        Please any suggestions you have would be appreciated.  Should I just quick temping because I don't wake up the same time every morning? Would it be a waste of time to take an hpt?  Husband was home around December 6th so could that be when I would have ovulated?  I had the symptoms of ovulation could I be pregnant? Thanks for your answers

I'm ttc for my first time.      I've been tracking my BBT and using fertilityfriend.com. The past 6 days my temp has risen. I ovulated on the 19th.      I had intercourse these days before ovulation: Tuesday the 13th, Thursday the 15th, and Sunday the 18th (which was the day before ovulation). So it was pretty much every other day. He came in me all 3 times.      My temp has also risen. Its usually anywhere from 96.1 - 96.8   But the past 6 days its been anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7      Since sunday, I have been having some symptoms. My breasts are sore, seem swollen, and are heavy. And I never get breast tenderness around my period time. Ever. (they just dont feel like usual, ya know?) I've also been a little nauseated. But that seems to come and go.   But I'm not supposed to start my period until Monday.   I've heard of alot of people tho, get symptoms very early on.      Is there a chance I'm pregnant? Good chance or not so good?      I also heard if your temp stays elevated for 12-16 days, its a good indicator your pregnant?      I'm just not sure, and need advice.   Help please.   Thanks and baby dust to everyone!      God Bless.         (yes this is a re-post of mine from earlier. I just really would like a lot of different peoples opinions. Thanks!)

Our oldest child is such a polite little girl and she is such a good sister to her brother and sister, but she is losing patience with them cos my son is constantly annoying her. My youngest has had a hard time growing up with a big brother, he bullies her around constantly and i dont know what eles to do but crack at him every time he hurts her. he is a very kind hearted boy and very smart, but something is causing him problems, he cant even play a game without going crazy, cos he is losing or he is just not happy with the way things are going, so he goes nuts and cries and smashes what ever it is. if we have only 1 drink he will make sure he is the 1st one to drink it and choose the next person and make sure my youngest does not get it, ive tried not giving it to him but it just causes him to go crazy even more, im really struggling with this because he gets all my attention while my beautiful little girls have to stand back and watch. At this stage im willing to do what ever it takes, we just dont agree with smacking them as its more our fault than theirs. what can we do???

First off....I am not pregnant, I'm not planning on having kids, and I am completely against abortion.  I'm just trying to get some facts to tell to my boyfriend and to make sure I was right with what I was telling him.  I tried showing him aborted baby pictures...and he said even 10 weeks was too far along, that it has to happen within like one week.  He said that the baby's in the pictures weren't really living to being with.  It makes me so mad.  I know that I will probably never be able to convince him otherwise, but that's beside the point.  That issue is like the only thing I seriously hate about him.      But anyways, how far along is too far to where a doctor wont do an abortion of any kind?
20090128201326AAbkxen	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Sick baby... what is this rash (pictures included)?	I am sick with just congestion, started with a sore throat and is now just nasal congestion.  This all started for me on Friday.      Yesterday, my 6 month old started with a little runny nose.  She acted like she felt fine, maybe a little sleepier than usual.      Today, she was the same until about two hours ago.  She is really cranky and tired but can't get to sleep.  I took her temperature and it is 99.5 F.      Well, I gave her a bath right after that and her back didn't have these marks.  About 5 minutes into her bath, I turned her around and I saw this on her back:       http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n249/...    There was one also on her chest.    http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n249/...       They aren't raised, except for a tiny little bump in the middle of each mark.        What could they be?  They have gotten a little lighter, but haven't gone away.  Now she is asleep.  Should I keep checking her throughout the night to make sure they are gone?      She is breastfed.  I just started her on BLW solids.  She has had broccoli, bananas and sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes were the most recently introduced (This Saturday).  She has only actually gotten a couple of tiny bites of those foods down, mostly just exploring.     Should I be worried that this is a reaction to the food?   Was the bath water maybe too hot?  It didn't seem too hot, but my fiance accuses me of making her bath water too hot.  I like my baths and showers really hot, apparantly, I'm told.  I make hers colder, of course, but maybe not cold enough?      She's never been sick before, so any advice/help would be appreciated.

I told him no the first time (even though im not 100% sure, I’m not due for my period for 3 more days) so why would he ask it again today? He doesn’t know my cycle or that we had sex 5 days before and 2 days after my expected ovulation date. Do you think that it’s possible that he thinks that he came inside me and is worried about it?

20090128201105AAKWdOL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	PCOS usually no periods, recently started regualr?	Since about age 16, my periods have been very irregular. As I've gotten older, they have become farther apart. I have recently been told I have PCOS and enlarged ovaries.    I am 25 now, and my husband and I decided that when 2009 came we would start trying TTC. We knew we would have to go to my doctor for major help and information   For the last 5 months my periods have been very regular. More regular than ever.    It started when I had a stomach ulcer and needed to take antibiotics. Two days after starting them I passed a very big blood clot. (normal in appearance to a reg period, just the size of my palm) I went to the doctor, and thats when they told me about the PCOS. After that first period, they have been regular since.    I even get cramps and everything. I used not to get that when I did finally get a period.   Anyone else experience this?   Has anyone conceived with PCOS?

20090128194808AAJWR6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	If she's pregnant what should she do?	A friend of mine is still in high school. She's 16 and her boyfriend is 18. She fears she might be pregnant.      She needs someones advice bad. Here is everything she's told me:      Her parents had to deal with her oldest sister being pregnant when she was seventeen, so she KNOWS that her parents would probably send her away to her dad's or grandmother's.   Her parents know that her and her boyfriend are sexually active, and although they are disappointed, they really like her boyfriend and knows that he takes very good care of her (which he does, i've met him)   His parents are very christian, but liberal, but they would not be happy about this, and it could ruin her relationship with his family.   They both know that they want an abortion.   She hasn't taken a pregnancy test yet, but she's missed her period by a day.   They haven't had unprotected, but the condom has slipped off, but the only thing in it at the time was pre-come.   She has no other symptoms but missed period, and she has been extremely stressed lately with her home life.      So, what are the chances she is pregnant?   Can have an abortion without telling her parents or his?   Is there any place that would fund the procedure?   If she has to, how can she tell her parents?      She is very stressed out, and needs help, and i don't know what to tell her!      I will pick a best answer as long as all of my questions are answered,   thankyou in advance.

20090128201505AA7a2yj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I have the grandparents spend the night at my house or theirs?  ?	My husband and I are going to go out of town over night this weekend.  My kids are 5 years and 10 months.  This will be the first time we have had a over night sitter for my 10 month old because he doesn't take a bottle and isn't sleeping through the night.  He does drink from a sippy cup.  I am nervous.  The kids will be with their grandparents (my in-laws.)  My mother-in-law offered to stay with the kids at my house verses theirs in hopes to make it more comfortable for my youngest son. I would rather them go to grandma and grandpa's because I am not crazy having my in-laws in my house for that long and it would be more fun for my older son. However, if my 10 month old will eat and sleep better in my house than it is worth it.      I am wondering what others would do. My thought is my son is pretty stubborn so he is either going to be good or not no matter where he is.  Should I have the grandparents spend the night at my house or theirs?

He also starting talking in sentences around Christmas time we we're looking at Christmas light and we said Stephen do you see it and he said I see it! That was at 14 months now he talks sentences and repeats all the time. He knows some of his colors just from me telling him once or twice and can distinguish between a horse and a cow with his toy animals.

We've never pushed but we have read to him since he was born basiclly so only polite opinouns please.

20090128201416AABaHku	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I feel like I took my son's newborn months for granted. Any other first time moms feel the same? ?	I am a first time mom, I have a 7 month old son. After he was born I was having major marriage problems, extreme post-partum depression, and I was just altogether overwhelmed as a new mom not knowing what I was doing. I also believe that I did not bond with my son right away... could have been because of the depression, I don't know, but it did take some time for me to bond with my son. Now I love him more than I've ever loved anything in this world.. I just wish I would have known then what I know now... that they grow so very fast and not to take any moment for granted or to wish any moment away for the next... because you can never get that time back.      Now my son is 7 months old and I cry every time I look at his newborn pictures because I wonder where 7 months has gone by so very quickly. I really can't even remember when he was a tiny little newborn because I feel like I wasn't focused on him, and being a first-time mom, I didn't realize he would grow up so fast. Now I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt and regret. I just wish I could go back and do it all over again and really just enjoy my son's first few months of life. I cry almost daily about this.      Am I being rediculous or do other first time moms feel this way?

20090128200614AACM2ye	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any fun activity ideas for parent and tot (3-8 month old babies) swim lessons?	Okay, I have to teach my first parent and tot swimming lessons (3 - 8 month old babies) and a couple weeks in, I am out of ideas.  I need some fun activities from any creative people, or parents with babies who have done this before.  And stuff that doesn't involve the babies swimming or putting their faces in the water.  Just fun things to engage the parents with the child and help the child become more comfortable in the water.  Big time wasters are awesome, things with pool toys are cool, and individual/group activities are great.        As well, there are the areas I have to cover, so getting activities to fall under these headings is great:   -entering/exiting water with tot   -hold tot on front, eye contact   -hold tot on back, head/back support   -readiness for submersion   -front float (face out)   -back float (ears in)   -float with PFD   -arms: splashing, reaching, paddling (front/back)   -legs: tickling, splashing, kicking (front/back)      This is all assisted of course.      Thanks in advance for serious answers.

20090128201814AADvrrD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to stay at a hotel with a 2 1/2 year old?  ?	My hubby, son (9 years) and myself would love to get away for a weekend to break up the monotony of winter.  But, my daughter (2 1/2 years) is a real stickler to routine and her bed.  She is in a toddler bed as she climbs out of playpens.  Any ideas on how to get her to sleep somewhere else and in a "big" bed?  She has never slept with anyone either, so that won't work.  Any advice is helpful.

20090128203202AA62CDN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What's up with people answering questions in a cruel manner in the Newborn & Baby section?	Why is it that everyone has a question about babies like breast feeding, postpartum life, what kind of baby foods, which diaper is best for baby and how to get a baby to use a sippy cup, and someone answers approiately, they get a thumbs down for trying to help or they get a smart-*** answer by idiots who ain't got nothing else to do but to start stuff? I thought that there's no such thing as a stupid question, but apparently there's a such thing as a stupid answer. What's your opinion?

20090128204035AAXg8H2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Cleaning products and nursing bras...?	I have two questions that sort of have nothing to do with each other:      1. I need to know which store I can go to that has Lansinoh (nipple) cream, nursing pads, and good nursing bras (something of good quality that's somewhat inexpensive). With my first baby I ordered all this online and I didn't want to do that this time. Should I go to Wal-Mart, Target, or what?      2. What cleaning products can I use to clean my baby's toys. I hear that vinegar is effective and safe to use. Is it just vinegar or should I mix it with water? How much should I use at a time? How long do I soak them in vinegar? and can I do it in the sink as opposed to a bucket or something? Suggestions please      Thanks girls!! =)

20090128203356AAje7sT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What's your opinion on this?	I'm 15. I met a guy who is 16 on myspace.    I know, you're automatically going to say shame on you, do not meet up with this guy blah blah blah.       Well we met each other about 5 months ago. We both trust each other, we know each other very well, and we both like each other and think we have feelings for each other.       I live in GA, he lives in FL, not too far away from each other.      And yes, I am positive he is not a 25 year old man or anything. We talk to each other over stickam all the time and he is obviously who he says he is. We also talk on the phone every single night and I can call him crying at midnight and he will answer and make me feel 50x better.      Well we've decided we really really want to meet each other in person. We are not planning on doing anything bad at all, we simply want to meet each other and hang out together.       Is there anyway at all we could make this happen by the summer?    We agreed that possibly we could get our parents to talk each other, that way maybe it will build trust??

20090128203501AACvM3x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How do you think this should be handled? "I can't control my 12yr old 911!" "Do you want us to shoot her?"?	 http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=DnCxgOVqHz...    Listen. This is for those that can't watch the vid:   The woman calls 911 saying she can't control her 12yr old daughter. She is "as big as I am!"   The 911 operator then says "Do you want us to come shoot her?"   Obiously it was a joke, and he says that straight away.   I personally think it's kind of funny. Though, the mother might have had more to say, e.g. "She is stabbing my toddler." But in this case, she just wanted help with discipline.      Thoughts? Fired or Forgiven?   I think forgiven. He seemed to be very sorry.
20090128204333AAiEcIE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How likely am I to get pregnant?	This is just a hypothetical question, so don't go saying, you don't wanna do that and lecturing and stuff. If I were to stop taking my birth control after tonight, and have sex a few times tomorrow and every day for the next few days, how likely am I to get pregnant?      Remember, it's just a question, I'm not actually gonna go do it. I was just curious. Thanks. =P
20090128203524AAThOsY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Mother to Daughter Relationship. Advice.?	i do believe i can tell my mother anything and i am quite close with her but sometimes i dnt feel like she needs to know some stuff about me. i understand that she is my mom and she wants to be updated because i am her child but sometimes it gets annoying having her constantly nag me or get upset if i dnt tell her something that she knows is bothering me. i do keep my distance [at times] because she can get really frustrating to talk to. she says "ive been a child b4, i no what its like" but sometimes i dnt think she does no what is going on in my mind. Do yuh think its best if i tell her most stuff about me? [because i can trust her to not get mad] or keep my distance and make her keep nagging me?
20090128203937AAhCpLD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I hate High school already....advice please?	I lost pretty much all my friends last year to video games, and there all pathetic wastes of life (story isnt relevant) since then I havent really made any new friends (I am in tenth grade right now) so I have been home on weekends watching re runs of friends, pretty much doing nothing. The kids in my grade either frown upon me or dont like me because one of the kids that used to be my friend made a fake screename preteding to be me and talked **** to everyone in my grade, another reason they may not like is me for my immaturity. And talking to my old friends about becoming friends again isnt an option, because I hate one of them with a strong passion. There is this girl who is a grade below that i think its kind of cute, she is in 2 of my classes but I havent said a word to her all year, because when ever I talk to girls I say stupid ****. Some of the things I like to do are Cook..I love cooking, long boarding, and having fun      What should I do? Im a sophomore in high school, Im 15 and I hate High school already.

20090128203110AAbiE7o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I think Im pregnant. What do i do?	Hello, Im really confused at the moment because i just discovered that i am most likely pregnant. I took two home pregnancy tests and one was positive: the other seemed positive but wasn't completely clear.       I intended to go to a clinic, however i'm having a problem with timing and finding a clean, trustworthy one in my area. Also, most of the local clinics are packed with people. I thought it may be better for the privacy from my family to go to one, however now I think it may be best to go to my regular doctor because it is more convenient for me and probably safer.       (i only ask about privacy because i am young and have a very strict and close-minded family. I am not underage, though.)      So, my questions are...      1. Will my regular doctor be any less discrete then a clinic?      2. Will my doctor refer me to a clinic?         Please, only answer if you are open minded and are only going to give me information I need. If you are going o tell me i'm stupid, please, DO NOT!

20090128203448AAgz6az	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Searching for a bouncy chair?	I am trying to find a bouncy chair that I control the music and not some flower that has to be pulled on by baby.       One that I control the music, vibration, and has the ability to recline to some degree would be great. I just want to know if anyone has found one similar to that and/or one they just love. I am having a girl but that doesn't mean it has to be pink. Any color will work.      Any help would be great since searching millions of pages aren't helping at all.
