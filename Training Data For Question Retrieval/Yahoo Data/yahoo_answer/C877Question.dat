20090220073035AAVETtV	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	About to close on a Refi in about a week. Was it a smart move?	My wife and I argue on this. She didn't want to go for it, I did. So I convinced her.   Currently we have about $243k left on the mortgage with 23 years to go. We are at 5.875%. We are refinancing into a new 30 year at 4.5% with 1 point. Home value is $400k. Closing costs is roughly $6500 with the point and without prepaid items (taxes, insurance..etc)      The way I see it, its shaving off about $391 per month with a new 30 year loan. We plan on continuing to pay the $391 for extra principal and we plan on living in the home for at least 10 years.      Was this a wise decision or not? I beleive so. My other half sometimes doesn't see things the way I do. So I guess I'm trying to make sure that spending the closing cost is worth going from 5.875 to 4.5.       Any opinions?       Thanks!   Chip

20090220074233AAILnQw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	Unemployment for being fired?	I live in Ohio and I have been working for a trucking company over the last few years.  I was having a medical problem and I set up an urgent operation with my doctor (per his request) because he was worried it would lead to a stroke.  I had two days off for this, the first day, I called to make the appointment and the second day was when my appointment was.  During this time, I was in the process of getting a new truck, and so the first day I tried to transfer my belongings from one truck to the other, for whatever reason, they said I couldn't do it that day.  I just thought I could do it after my appointments the next day so I wasn't worried.  I then got a call the day of my appointments saying that they needed me to come NOW to move my stuff or they were going to do it for me.  I had many expensive items (ex. Tom Tom) and those things "mysteriously" always come up missing when other people move items in the trucking business.  I asked them to work with me so I could do it later in the day and explained how my doctor thought I would have a stroke if I didn't get in to see him but they were unrelenting and didn't care, they said they would take my stuff out of my truck and put it in a building to sit.  I then lost my temper (and fully understand this was a horrible idea and fully my responsibility but I made a mistake and yelled) and therefore, I was fired the next day.        I assume that I cannot file for unemployment since I caused it but I wanted to be sure, anybody know?   Thanks in advance! Sorry it was so long.

Shortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics professor and says, "I don't understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?"       The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you."       The student agreed.       At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house.      The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.      They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket.       Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can."      The student did as he was instructed.       The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.       The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.       The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?"          The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.       The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.       However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad.      The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have    been truly productive action!"       The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations. You now understand the stimulus bill."       Dick Johnson

However, I was informed by my boss that the President of the board and two other board members got together and decided there wasn't enough money to keep me employed, and that they were making an executive decision to lay me off.    I have a few issues with this. 1- Only three members of the board decided this, and I know that not every board member was informed of the decision. 2- I have recently received a few grants that were restricted to pay for my salary, and there is enough left to keep me employed for 6-8 months. 3- The president of the board has been telling other board members that she "took care of the problem" by letting me go, stating that I have been nothing but problems since I was hired. A few months ago I was applying for a federal grant and it was determined that the board president had a conflict of interest issue that would deter us from applying for the grant. Ever since that issue was brought up, she has been really hard on me and the Exec. Director. At the meeting where the three board members informed my boss that I was being let go, the president said they could do whatever they wanted, it's a right to work state. I really want my job back and don't want this renegade board to undo all the hard work and hurt all the people we try to help as a non-profit. Do I have a case?

I am filing my taxes online with H & R Block for probably the 5th year in a row.  I have everything complete but my form for education expenses last year.  I keep getting an error that says that form is not ready yet and to check back in late January.  It's now February 3rd and it still says the same thing.  They claim that the government changes tax laws very close to the end of the year sometimes and they have to wait until they are sure that the forms are correct.  But, if that was the case, how could other companies i.e. turbo-tax, have their tax forms ready?  Also, I know people that have gone in person to H & R Block as early as Jan. 15th and completed their taxes.  What are they waiting for online?

I have received my B.A. in Psychology and was not really interested in getting my M.A. in the three choices that were provided by my school. I love working with people but I get too emotionally attached to those who come to me with problems. I don't think that I am too interested in working as a social worker or anything of that sort. What other jobs can I look into this degree?. Right now I work as advertising designer in a small company and I do enjoy what I do, but I get paid next to nothing. Someone mentioned to me Human Resources positions, but everyone of them that I looked at, needed someone with management or human resources extensive experience. In this job market, the options are so scarce... almost all of the job ads nowadays ask to e-mail the resume or fax it it and to not come in for an interview! It is very hard to sell yourself when no one wants to see what you are selling... Anyone know what other options I could look into? I would rather not work at a hospital or a clinic... I like the office environment and I feel the most comfortable there. In case the age is relevant, I am 28 yrs old. I just want to do something that I will enjoy and get paid for my level of education achieved... which is not $10 an hour.

My status on the IRS site says that it is processing (I filed a paper return on Jan 30-they got it Feb. 1st) and unless they find anything else I should receive a check by 3-10-2009.      1.)

I mailed in my return because that never seems to have the E-file BS that comes with the date switching 9,000 times. I was curious though, I asked for direct deposit but the 24th is not a printed sent date off the Efile Refund Cycle Chart. WMR has not switched on me It said file accpeted on Feb 9th, then said payment should be to me by March 9th, now said DD will occur on the 24th. It pays to mail it in the old fashioned way becuase they have the W-2's present. Reasons why there are so many switches with people who file early is if the company you work for have not given the info to the Social Security Office then they have to verify with Employers. Sorry to answer during my question but people mail it in and just ask for DD you do not get these problems.

I work for a small company who is very shady about paying their employees. Basically, we get paid Salary but, if we miss 1 hour during a pay period we a dropped to hourly and our paychecks reflect that.      So to break it down, if we are paid Salary, we cannot get paid more if we work over time and we are not paid overtime for holidays but at the same time, if we work less than 80 hours we are bumped down to hourly and we actually lose hours/money on our checks. Is that even legal?

20090220095723AA2QBeU	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	House buying, earnest money question?	My fiance and I are in the process of buying a house. We found the house we wanted and put a contract on it around the 18th of Jan. We were supposed to close on the 14th of Feb so he got all the utilities set up on the 13th so it would be ready to move in. The 14th rolls around and we find out the appraiser hasn't shown up yet, so the date is pushed to last Tuesday. Wed he finally goes out, turns in his appraisal, and it's 1500 less than what our offer on the house was... and our offer was 10k less than the owners were asking too. Now the bank says, you gotta pay that 1500, we're not doing the loan for that extra amount. The owners say they won't take 1500 off the price. I'm ticked because they'd already had one contract fall through after the other buyer's bank refused the loan and I'm betting it was for the same reason, so they knew this would happen. My fiance wants to tell the owners to keep their house, and we find something else, but we just paid all those utility deposits plus the $500 earnest money. I'm letting him make the final call on this, but my question is, can we get the $500 earnest money back? Clearly we were sincere about the offer, and if the appraisal had matched what the sellers wanted we'd be closing it up today. I don't really understand how earnest money thing works. Also wondering about the utility deposits.

The security firm I was employed by for a little over a year had transferred branch offices and had given me a one day notice of the transfer. I then had found out the next day was my last day at the job site and was told by my current manager that my current position was filled by other employee's. Then I contacted the new branch office and was told there were no longer any positions for me. Then my current branch manager offered work within an unreasonable distance of commute and I momentarily cannot drive because a medical eye condition in progress of treatment to meet DMV standards to obtain a license. I was only told to take a few days off and was told to apply at the new branch office but there were only driving positions open which I can't drive at the moment. I of course want to get back to work and it would take me about a month or so to get my eyes fixed and driver license and I am not legally blind or anything. I;m just waiting on specialized contact lenses.

Dear all,      I've been receiving Job Seekers' Allowance after being considered redundant for a couple of months now, and I have applied for housing benefit at my local borough (Lewisham). However, my tenancy agreement will terminate in a 1-month time, so I have started looking for 1-bedroom apartments. I have found a very good 1-bedroom apartment at the price of ï¿¡1,000 a month, slightly more expensive than the one I'm living in now. What is the procedure to claim housing benefit from another borough? Is there any process that I can get a 'pre-approval' before signing any tenancy agreement? Is there any reason Camden might reject my claim?      Thank you so much in advance!

She quit paying the mortgage and is putting the house in the BK and walking away from it. I moved back in the house this last month. My income is down about 60% from 2007, I sell cars for a chevy dealership in Las Vegas. My question is what will happen if I do not file BK, I do not think I can qualify for chapter 7 Bk right now anyway. If I can get my income up I can pay off all my debt in 18 months. I am thinking that might be  the way to go. The house is going to be the difficult thing because we are upside down. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

I've been looking for travel insurances online and came across moneysupermarket.com, where I found what I was looking for.      The thing is that a lot of the insurances that come up are quite a bit cheaper on moneysupermarket.com than on the official websites of the insurance companies.      I am not sure what to do. If I take out an insurance over moneysupermarket.com is it still going to be effective? I am just confused because of the price differences. Do they have some sort of deal with insurance companies that would justify the different pricing?      Thank you.

I attend a school in the Orlando area and I have had nothing but problems with since I enrolled.  They are first and foremost deceptive in their attempt at getting students enrolled.  They blatantly lie about everything in order to get you in.  I have sat through several courses where I sit around in class doing absolutely nothing while the teacher plays with her laptop. We, the students, have had to figure out what to do on our own to fill the class time.  Out of the 3 years worth of education that I am supposed to have had, only half of that, have been worth my money.  Yet, they refuse to credit me for the classes that haven't been taught to me.  This is a clear case of breach of contract.  Not to mention a MULTITUDE of other issues that we all as a student body have had to endure.  We would love to file a class action lawsuit or something against this school but we need help.  Anyone who has any resources or who is able to help, please contact.  Thanks for listening. :)

I would like to know under my circumstances if my wife and I would qualify for the $8,000 first time home buyer credit. Here is the situation... I bought a house in 2001 before I was married. I am now married and my name is the only name on the deed and her name is not associated with the house in any way. We are buying a new house and closing 1st of March. We are buying the house in my wife's name only (She has not bought a new house in over 5 years) and may or may not put my name on the deed as well, depending on if it will hinder our chances of getting the credit.      My question is since I have a house in my name (bought 8 years ago) and we are buying our new house in my wife's name only, would we be able to qualify for the $8,000 credit. Secondly, would we have to file our taxes separately? and would it matter if my name is on the deed of the new house but not the loan?      Thanks

I'm going to be moving to NY to be with my fiance next year and we're naturally looking to buy a property and start a family over the next few years.      He's lived in Manhattan all his life, but the cost of property as I'm sure you well know is diabolical in NYC so we're researching surrounding areas.      Neither of us have much experience of New Jersey. Which areas are closest to NYC and easily accessible using public transport? We'll both more than likely be working in Manhattan so will be commuting daily.      Realistically how much should be we looking to save for a deposit? I live in London so obviously there are differences in the 2 markets.      We want to buy a 2 bedroom property, a garden would be nice, though it's not the be end and end all. Somewhere that has good transport links and local amenities as well as being safe to raise a family. I'm not talking about the equivalent to The Hamptons cost-wise either! (we're not millionaires ...yet! LOL)      Your advice would be much appreciated.      Also which estate agent (real estate as you guys call it) websites would you recommend I start browsing to get a good idea of the kind of money we're looking at here?      Many thanks :-)

I just got my car fixed and that's $232.  And then what I have left to pay on my car insurance is $160.  I also owe a lot on my credit card.  I could put that $500 towards those things and completely not even think about it (would it be worth it?)  However, I also would like to do this on my own, put that money away, and use my regular paychecks to pay that stuff off.  I get paid this Friday.  My paycheck should be around $400, which is just enough to pay for my insurance and car bill.  I don't have to pay my car bill until mid-January, so I don't HAVE to use this paycheck for that.  I know that I can pay off all of my debt on my own.  It just may take a couple months, which is fine with me.  I'm also afraid that if I put that $500 onto my credit card that I'll just charge $500 again and then that $500 would've gone to waste! Should I just save the money?
