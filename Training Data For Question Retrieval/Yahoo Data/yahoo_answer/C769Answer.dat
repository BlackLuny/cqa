EMDNVrcjaa	Yes, here are directions.<br>  We received a toaster oven for Christmas, thus, I've been trying different foods in it. The latest was bacon. My god was it good, beautiful. delicious.<br>  <br>  Order of operations for bacon in a toaster oven:<br>  <br>     1. spread bacon out over grill, make sure drip tray is underneath<br>     2. Cook at 400-425 for ~20 minutes<br>     3. Open toaster oven, check to see if fat is white and crispy. If the fat wasn't bursting, then it wasn't cooking well enough. If cooked well enough, skip to step 5.<br>     4. In case it wasn't crispy, turn to 450F and cook for 4-5 minutes.<br>     5. Carefully remove bacon from toaster oven<br>     6. Place bacon on paper towel to remove some of the fat.<br>     7. EAT!<br>  <br>  Really though, I'm sure most of you already know how to cook bacon but this was the tastiest bacon I've had, ever!|`|qDk6uCzQaa	It depends on what settings your toaster oven has. Some of them have oven settings, in which case you could probably follow the regular oven settings.<br>  <br>  If you have a pop-up toaster (in which case I don't think they're called toaster ovens), then no. You can't cook bacon in those.|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	You can't because some of the fat from the bacon would drip to the bottom of the toaster oven.|`|EPMtOJkbaa	of course you can,just cover bottom with tinfoil,and bake at 350-375,until desired crispness is done P.S dont fall asleep,or put timer on.|`|YupMCYHlaa	It's not exactly the same as fried bacon, but yes, you can do it.  Put the bacon between two pieces of tinfoil to keep it from splattering everywhere and 'bake' it at 450 or however hot the oven will go.  Or if you have a broiler pan you can broil it, but it would be messy.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Well - if you absolutely had to make bacon and had no other heating source - you could do it by wrapping a single layer in foil - heating the toaster oven up to 350 and baking it for about 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  The bacon would NOT get crisp that way - but at least it would be cooked and food-safe.<br>  <br>  You would have to wrap it in foil as there are heating elements on the top and bottom - grease from the cooking bacon would spatter up onto the top element and smoke or cause a fire.

The water chestnut's brownish-black skin resembles that of a true chestnut, but its flesh is white, crunchy and juicy. The flavor is bland with a hint of sweetness. Water chestnuts are very popular in Asian cooking, especially in stir-fried dishes where their crunchy texture is a standout. Water chestnuts are available fresh in most Chinese markets. Choose firm chestnuts with no sign of shriveling. Refrigerate, tightly wrapped in a plastic bag, for up to a week. Peel before using raw or in cooked dishes. Water chestnuts are also available canned-either whole or sliced-in most supermarkets, but the fresh are superior."|`|Om9CFRpsaa	Water chestnuts - exactly.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	water chestnut or water lily fruit, both have same taste and are expensive.

As for you dinner tomorrow.  Season the fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder or lemon pepper season with some garlic is great.  Heat a non-stick skillet to medium high heat.  Oh, make sure to pat dry the fish before seasoning.  Add olive oil to the pan, sear fish 2 minutes per side and Tilapia will be done.  The pan will be rather hot and the oil will smoke just a bit, that is when you know the pan is ready for the fish.  remove fish, place on serving platter, tent with foil. I like to saute garlic and mushrooms in the pan I made my fish, add some butter and lemon juice for a wonderful sauce.

I use a generous amount of the garlic and onion powders to coat the breasts on both sides. They add a lot of favor with no fat. Do not use garlic and onion salt, or if you do, don't salt the meat, as it will be too salty. Place the chicken pieces in the baking dish.<br>  <br>  Lay a large slice or two small slices of tomato on each breast. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil. No need to use a lot.

lmT3zXa9aa	I agree with Jane.  I grew up in a home outfitted with appliances from the 1950s.  The oven and stove worked almost identically to those of today.  I do remember a refrigerator that had a much smaller freezer - in fact the the freezer compartment was actually inside the fridge - a person opened the fridge door and there was a smaller door at the top that had the tiny freezer compartment.<br>  Of course, there were no microwaves.  Coffee was made either in an electric percolator or on the stove - not too many drip coffee makers in use then.<br>  My mother's toaster was very similar to what I have today, but I do remember a neighbor who had one that had  doors on two sides and the bread had to be flipped over so that it would toast on both sides.  She put a slice of bread in each side by opening the door, and there was a heating element, but it only heated one side of the bread as the other side of the bread faced the door.<br>  My mother's stand mixer was big and heavy, but I don't think it was really much heavier than my KitchenAid stand mixer.  However, my mom's could convert to a "portable" as the head could be removed from the stand.  <br>  I do remember that the oven had a "timed bake" feature in which a person could set the oven to begin baking at a later time.  Why this would have been useful I can't say - meat shouldn't be kept out of the fridge more than a hour, and baked goods don't wait once they are mixed.  I don't remember anyone using this, but the option was there.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	If memory serves, not a whole lot has changed other than the appliances being more energy efficient and modern looking. Mixers were big and heavy, pans were the same, although better made in my opinion.

It helps a ton!|`|1CJggYYLaa	Lean protein like chicken, turkey, fish (serving size is size of your fist)<br>  Fresh vegetables, the darker in color the better (the more, the better)<br>  Fresh fruits (several servings)<br>  Kids your age need milk and milk products (for strong bones and teeth)<br>  Whole grain breads

What this does is form a nice brown crust that will allow the muffins to be easily removed, and they hold together nicely.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Corn muffins are known to be crumbly. After mixing the batter, let it rest for a couple minutes before sliding them into the oven. You will get a better crown (top) which may help with the texture.

Take an old sheet (or two) spread out on the floor to protect your carpet and have the girls each make their own jewelry box or picture box (have them bring their favorite pictures (let the parents know the pictures will be cut and glued no originals).or even a wish box or keepsake box.  pretend you are 12 and let your Imagination go wild!  you can also make beaded bracelets with fishing line or friendship bracelets out of yarn.  GO CRAZY!!  PS the employees often have great ideas too|`|AA10963706	This has been "out of style" for a long time but plan a scavenger hunt in the neighborhood.  They are so much fun and neighbors usually really get into helping.  Set boundaries and make sure adults are out walking around with the kids but it's fun to see who can "find" the weirdest things.  It helps the kids pass time and be active instead of just eating and gossiping all night.  They can do that when they get back and need to re-charge on junk food!|`|HPagWA90aa	If she's nearly twelve years old, then surely she has some of her own ideas about what she wants to happen at her party-so ask her!

We decided to meet in Tennessee this year for my birthday. My mom rented an awesome cabin in the mountains with a pool table, air hockey, four floors, a flat screen, hot tub, and we were about 8 minutes away from the smokey national park so we went hiking there. It was one of the most beautiful sights i have ever seen!

First snip the citron peel into ? inch (1 cm) strips and arrange these in an overlapping circle in the centre of the base of the basin; you need something that resembles a flower. Then, using a sharp pair of scissors, snip the whole candied peels lengthways into strips, but leaving the end intact. Imagine five fingers attached to a hand and you've got it. Now arrange these around the 'flower', spreading out the strips as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Now, for the pudding, simply beat the sugar and butter with an electric hand whisk until the mixture is pale and creamy and drops off a spoon easily with a sharp tap. Then beat the eggs in a jug and add these a minute amount at a time, whisking well after each addition. When all the liquid egg is incorporated carefully fold in the sifted flour, mace and salt, followed by the lemon juice, grated lemon and orange zest, chopped apple and finally the mincemeat.<br>  <br>  Now spoon the mixture into the basin, being careful to leave your artistic arrangement intact. Tie a double piece of pleated foil on to the basin, place it in a steamer over boiling water and steam for 2? hours.<br>  <br>  When the pudding is completely cold you can turn it out, wrap it well and freeze it till needed.<br>  <br>  Take it out of the freezer late on Christmas Eve and re-steam on Christmas Day for 1? hours. Serve cut in slices with Hot Punch Sauce.|`|f661b017cf865f4b3a3d0a82f9431aebaa	This one should do the trick:<br>  <a href="http://www.gourmet-food-revolution.com/gourmet-dessert-recipe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gourmet-food-revolution.com/g...</a>|`|630a76157162f1f09d6dcfc46488067eaa	sorry no recipe:-( if i could find any i will give u:-)

Es muy buena. solamente sigue las instrucciones del paquete para preparar la masa y una vez que la tengas entonces hay que hacer una bolita, que quepa en tu pu?o, luego puedes aplanarla con ambas manos, como si estuvieras aplaudiendo, cuidando que no se te desmorone, si no <br>  puedes ocupar un par de platos planos para hacerlo, cuando ya lo hayas logrado y obtenido el grosor que deseas, en la estufa pones un comal a calentar. Cuando ya esté calientito pones tu gordita a cocer, hay que tener paciencia y esperar a que se cueza de un lado, luego con un volteador dale la vuelta y espera a que se cueza del otro lado, dale varias vueltas hasta que estés seguro de que ya está totalmente cocida tu gordita, luego puedes abrirla a la mitad con un cuchillo e introducir en su interior el guisado que prefieras. Para cocinar las papas<br>  puedes cocer primero tus papitas, peque?as de preferencias, cuando ya esten cocidas las partes en cuartos. Apártalas. Si las quieres con rajas, tendrás que preparar con un chile poblano tus rajas. El chile lo pones a asar directamente a la flama de la estufa, por todos lados esperas a que se queme la cutícula. Cuando hayas terminado, sumérgelo en agua helada y luego quítale toda la cutícula. Abre el chile y desvénalo y elimina todas las semillas. Luego haz tiritas y apártalas en un plato. Cuando ya tengas las rajas de chile y las papas partidas. Calienta en un sartén aceite, puede ser de maíz, de cártamo o de oliva, pon a freir un ajo en trocitos, luego a?ade un cuarto de cebolla en cuadritos y espera a que se tornen transparentes, cuando esto ocurra a?ade tus rajas de chile, incorpóralas completamente y luego a?ade las papas en cuadritos.

7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I found this on the Mayo clinic <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN01024" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-an...</a><br>  <br>  It says it depends on the cheese. If it's a hard cheese than cut off the mold and it will be alright. If it's semi soft, same thing. If the cheese is a soft cheese then you should discard it. <br>  <br>  You should also realize that many cheese are made that contain mold like bleu cheese aka  Roquefort. And people eat these with the mold already on them. But the website stated that if the mold is not part of the manufacturing process of the cheese then you should cut it off. The website mentioned that this bacteria can also contain harmful bacteria such as listeria, brucella, salmonella and E. coli and that this is the main reason why you should cut the mold off the cheese.<br>  <br>  EDIT: All that info and I didn't really answer the question. lol. Yea that is the beginning of mold on your cheese.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	Yes it is. You can just eat it like that. It's not going to hurt you. Think of it as penicillin. Second you could just cut it off but it won't do anything but make you feel better chances are that the mold has roots all over the cheese, hence it's everywhere.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	It is the beginning of a form of mold.  Simply cut it off and the cheese is fine to eat.|`|sG5FKmAYaa	Yes it is mould, but it isn't anything to worry about with the storage. <br>  Continue to slice your cheese off the block and 'then' slice off the mould bit.<br>  The mould will actually protect the block so there is no need to trim the entire block.<br>  Keep your cheese in the shrink wrap it comes in and just trim it off one end.
AA11786341	The seven easy steps to perfect homemade yogurt<br>  Step 1 <br>  <br>  Assemble your 'yogurt making' equipment - which is actually far more basic than you'd expect! Yes, you can buy a yogurt maker - and yes, it may make things a little easier. But it's by no means essential - we regularly prepare our own yogurt and have NEVER used one! <br>  Here's what you'll need... <br>  <br>  32 fl oz (equivalent to 1 quart or 1 litre) whole milk. Your baby needs fats in his diet, so using whole milk when making his yogurt is important. For other family members, you may prefer to use a reduced fat variety. <br>  2tbsp natural, unflavoured yogurt. Take the yogurt out of the refrigerator about 15-30 mins before you start, so that it's as near as possible to room temperature when you add it to the milk. <br>  A large pot with a lid. <br>  A food thermometer (it needs to include temperatures from 110 to 180 deg F - a candy or sugar thermometer is perfect). <br>  A large spoon. <br>  Please note that the quantities of milk and yogurt shown here are just to illustrate the proportions you'll need. You can double or even treble the quantities if you wish. <br>  <br>  Step 2 <br>  <br>  Fill the pot with water, boil for a few minutes, then add the spoon and thermometer. This sterilizes your equipment and ensures a better end result. <br>  <br>  Step 3 <br>  <br>  Empty the pot, then pour in the milk. Gently warm it to a temperature of 185 deg F, to kill any 'bad' bacteria it may contain (these can have an adverse effect on the finished product). Watch the pot closely and be careful not to burn the milk! <br>  <br>  Step 4 <br>  <br>  Remove the pot from the heat and set aside. You need to cool the milk to between 110 and 115 deg F, because these are the temperatures between which the live bacteria will efficiently ferment the milk. <br>  <br>  It is possible to spped up this step by sitting the pot in a larger pot full of ice. But - unless you're willing to stir the pot every minute or two to ensure even cooling - we wouldn't recommend this and find it easier to allow the milk to cool by itself. <br>  <br>  Step 5 <br>  <br>  Thoroughly stir the yogurt into the milk, then immediately place the lid on the pot. Move the pot at once to a warm place, where you can leave it - undisturbed - for a minimum of six hours. <br>  <br>  There are two important rules to obey at this point to guarantee a good yogurt... <br>  Keep the pot at a constant temperature of between 110 and 115 deg F. The live bacteria will become inactive at lower or higher temperatures. <br>  Don't move the pot at all, or stir the fermenting milk. This slows down the process and you may be disappointed with your results at the end of the waiting time! <br>  How to keep the pot at a consistent temperature... <br>  <br>  Most ovens do not have a low enough heat setting for producing yogurt, so here are a few other methods to try: <br>  Sit the pot in an oven warmed by the pilot light alone - our pilot light burns fiercely, so this works well for us! <br>  Sit the pot on an electric warming pad (like the ones you use for back pain). You may need to experiment a little with the heat settings! <br>  Wrap the pot in a very thick blanket - if this isn't warm enough, sit the wrapped pot in a cooler for extra insulation. <br>  Put the pot in the airing cupboard/boiler closet. <br>  <br>  <br>  Readers' pics...<br>   <br>  <br>  I find it tricky to use a thermometer, but otherwise it was very pleasant. I made the yogurt in the vanilla flavor. I didn't want to add purees, in case my son would not like it. He loved it! See for yourself! <br>  <br>  Manon Bradshaw - Frisco, Texas, USA <br>  <br>  Send in your baby food photograph and win!<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 6 <br>  <br>  After a minimum of 6 hours, take a look at your yogurt. The longer you leave the yogurt, the thicker it will become (and the more 'tangy' it will taste!). We actually find 7 hours to be the perfect length of time. <br>  <br>  Now - you may find that the yogurt doesn't look quite the way you were expecting it to! <br>  <br>  It will probably have a 'layer' of liquid on top of milk curds - and the liquid may even look a little yellow. Don't worry - this is totally normal! Just mix the curds and the liquid together (although it's OK to spoon the liquid off if you prefer!). <br>  <br>  The yogurt will be thinner in consistency than store-bought yogurts - but that's because they tend to contain additional thickeners and YOUR yogurt is 100% natural! Remember - you can make it a little thicker next time by allowing it to ferment for longer. <br>  <br>  Step 7 <br>  <br>  Pour your homemade yogurt into suitable containers with lids, then refrigerate. Refrigeration actually stops the bacteria in the yogurt from creating any more lactic acid - that's why the yogurt doesn't ferment and thicken any further. You can store it for up to a week in the refrigerator. <br>  <br>  Voila! Your homemade yogurt is ready... wasn't that easy? <br>  <br>  Now you've seen how quickly you can produce large batches of healthy and delicious homemade yogurt.|`|AA11394457	Don't know why some people make simple things so complicated.<br>  <br>  Take a litre of full fat milk, heat it to body temperature, mix in 2 tablespoon of plain live yogurt, pour it in a flask and forget about it for at least 6 hours, and that's all you have to do.|`|AA11180444	<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Plain-Yogurt/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Pl...</a>|`|8RCOlWdMaa	I use Simply yogurt in my yogurt maker - its the best I've ever made and so easy, just takes 9 hours to set from start.

Those PETA videos don't bother me at all honestly,  I've seen how Peta works first hand when they drug a poor camera man from TV to a lure coursing trial for hounds.  They were a tad embarrassed when they learned the "bunny" that we had slain so many of so cruelly with our dogs was really a white hefty bag...<br>  <br>  personally  I think all vegetarians and vegans should try their chosen lifestyle without all the vitamins and supplements they end up taking to remain healthy for a year.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Yes, and if they can't do it, they shouldn't be eating meat.

Religious concerns were never too far from his thinking and work, even when he was making a name for himself writing songs about love, and he had focused ever more on this side of life since Various Positions. He came to spend time at the Mt. Baldy Zen Center, a Buddhist retreat in California, and eventually became a full-time resident, becoming a Buddhist monk during the late '90s.

eazdrgzHaa	you don't need butter on the pan if its non-stick or if the batter has butter/oil in it. When you pour the batter in the pan, let cook the pancake until the top has bubbles, the flip, and you only flip once. don't keep flipping the pancake!!! the temperature should be around medium: if its low, it will take too long to cook, if its hi, the pancake will burn|`|kEgXrX0saa	After mixing your batter, preheat a cast iron skillet to medium high heat with a tablespoon of oil just enough to coat bottom of skillet, pour about 1/2 cup batter per pancake, let it cook till it bubbles on top then turn. Make sure your skillet doesn't get too hot, keep coating in between each batch of pancakes.<br>  <br>  Just an added tip, if your making pancakes from a boxed mix, you can add 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to your batter for a little added flavor.<br>  Or as you add the batter, this is when you can add chopped nuts, or blueberries to your batter.|`|GeimyUi6aa	What? u cook pancakes on a pan dah... thats y they are called pan- cakes|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Medium temperature, spray the pan with non stick spray, wait for the pan to heat up before pouring your batter.  Use about 1/4 cup batter per pancake.  Wait for edges to look dry, not wet like the middle, and look for bubbles and holes over the top -- flip over.  Wait about 2 minutes and the pancake will be done.  Continue this process with the rest of your batter.|`|AA11707728	You put a tablespoon of butter on the pan, melt it at medium heat.  Pour enough batter in the pan to make one pancake.  Flip it when the one side is cooked to the consistency you like it.  Slide it out of the pan and onto a plate when it's done.  Drop another tablespoon of butter into the pan and repeat for the next pancake.<br>  <br>  If you use lard or vegetable oil, you can turn the heat up higher but the pancakes aren't as good.  Some people will fry maple bacon in the pan and then use the grease from that to make pancakes.  But the best pancakes, in my opinion, are buttery......and butter requires relatively low temperature frying.|`|JzVIDI4raa	i just got the big griddle for my wedding and used it on pancakes, no butter, no oil, just poured the batter right on the griddle and waited until they bubbled all over.

I very lightly oil the surface, and then ladle the batter on.  When it shows bubbles, you turn it over.<br>  <br>  If I were to use a frying pan, it would be similar - a very light coating of oil, or even none if the pan is non stick.<br>  <br>  Of course, real maple syrup (heating the syrup is a nice touch), served with bacon, and chocolate milk. Yum!|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	Use a medium weight skillet, and heat it over medium-low to medium heat. I use setting 4 out of 10 on my stove.<br>  If you use a nonstick skillet, you don't need to butter the pan.

xUfRRGM8aa	Well for the first course you could go two ways contrast the flavors or compliment them. Both appropriate ways to choose wine. You could pick a Pinot Noir which is a light bodied red this might pick up some peppery notes in the chutney and compliment them. Although it may make the tuna taste "tinny" depending on how you cook the tuna. A good tuna should be served rare to medium rare and the tuna will not taste good with this. If you cook your tuna medium well to well it would go fine with the pinot (but the tuna would be dry:( I would go with a nice German Riesling. It is a sweet white wine that has apple and pear notes. Sweet wine is the best with spicy dishes because it contrasts the flavor and cleanses your palette. It is also a good dessert wine. Ice wine is like Riesling but much sweeter. This would be the best for your dessert. But ice wines are very expensive and the bottles are half the size of a normal bottle (but three times more pricey) The Riesling will compliment both courses better than another choice.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Tuna is a meaty and hearty fish.

Food has been fortified for the better part of the past century---- for meat eaters also.   Why is it so important to some people to come here and lie because they don't like vegetarians or vegans?  My doctor graduated from Cornell and Tufts Universities, and one of his specialties is nutrition. He would tell you that scienceteacher is wrong.  Period.  Some people enjoy trying to scare new vegans out of it.  I've been vegetarian or vegan most of my life, and I'm in excellent health, because I eat right and take care of myself.   I have not needed the services of a doctor other than for advice and a regular checkup-- in over two decades.    And you've got to be kidding me about the shape of the teeth as an argument for what the body needs nutritionally.   If that person is indeed a teacher (which I doubt seriously)   I feel bad for the students who will receive a poor education based on false information that is built on opinion rather than scientific fact.    I give scienceteacher an F and recommend remedial education. <br>  <br>  The American Dietetic Association would also disagree with that person  <a href="http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Vegans do not eat anything that comes from animals.

z6GBL5l0aa	You really should buy a book with guidelines about becoming a vegetarian so you get an idea about how to live your life. Also, considering that you are 50 years old, you should consult a nutritionist or your doctor. If you want to become a vegetarian than you really need to broaden your horizons on food. Fruits and veggies are a really big part of a vegetarian diet. <br>  There are many types of vegetarians too! Vegans only eat fruits, veggies, and grains. Nothing they eat involves any sort of living creature and this includes honey! Ovo-vegetarians eat veggies, fruits, grains, and eggs. This puts some protein into their diets. Lacto-vegetarians eat  veggies, fruits, grains, and dairy products. This includes things such as milk, ice cream, butter, yogurt, etc. Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat the some things as a lacto-vegetarian but they incorporate eggs into their diets. Then there are those who are "occasional" vegetarians or "semi vegetarians." They might include fish or chicken into their diets but any other meats they do not eat. <br>  I would not recommend being a vegetarian if you are finicky about food because you really need to try new things to get all the nutrients you need. There are also a lot of choices at grocery stores now. Premade items are really good. Amy's makes a lot of yummy choices. <br>  Good luck with this!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Being vegetarian is not bad for you IF you do it right. If you make sure you eat a good amount of healthy and nutritious foods, you're going to be fine, possibly even healthier than when you ate meat. You can easily add some veggies to a lot of dishes that you normally eat and it's easy. For example put some veggies in with your pasta or sandwiches or burritos or whatever. Frozen vegetables are great because they keep for so long. A good way to get fruit is to make fruit smoothies. Use some frozen bananas and other fruits and put some milk or soy milk and some sweetener and there you go, easy and healthy and tastes good. Some imitation meats taste nasty but I love Garden Burgers. Put it in a burger with some lettuce and onions and tomatoes and it's really good. Perhaps the hardest nutrient to get as a vegetarian is iron, so be sure to eat some beans or nuts or leafy greens or dried fruit once or twice a day, and eat lots of whole grains, then you'll be fine. It's true some vegetarians might be skinny but that's because they don't eat right. Some meat-eaters don't eat right and become sick too. You just got to be smart about it. And no technically vegetarians don't eat chicken or seafood. Good luck, let us know if you have other questions.|`|N2hMFrlYaa	Vegetarian eating, when done properly is very healthy. Just like a diet including meat, when done properly is very healthy. <br>  <br>  Since your diet at the moment really couldn't be called healthy, you are not going to be less healthy if you become vegetarian.<br>  <br>  However. Vegetarian does kind of mean that you need to eat vegetables. The clue is in the name ;o) If you don't like vegetables, then becoming a vegetarian will be a non-starter for you. Yes you could live off quorn or soya, but really why would you want to?<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you don't give up meat yet, but try introducing some more veg into your diet. It sounds like you don't cook much from scratch. how about buying a student cookbook (these are full of cheap, simple nutritious, filling meals) and try cooking some veg. Having cooked it yourself, you might enjoy it more!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And no, vegetarians don't eat any meat, fish or chicken (not even prawns, that is total bollocks)|`|VSM68mIzaa	Eat meat!

That just shows arrogance and apathy! Eat whatever you feel like eating when you feel like eating it as long as your not overindulging yourself and getting fat.<br>  <br>  Sense vegans and veggie heads only eat natural food, (Like cows aren't natural and no other creature that eats other creatures can't just survive on veggies! Lets believe these liberal lies for a second so I can deliver a powerful message!)<br>  <br>  Sense vegans and veggie heads only eat natural food, then I suggest they try a new diet that suites them just fine, its called, Coprophagia, feel free to open your mouth and have a taste of what veggie and vegans are full of.<br>  <br>  Also try, Urophagia, to wash down those veggie and vegan friendly diet I just recommended. The drink is veggie and vegan friendly too.<br>  <br>  Too much of anything is a bad thing. To limit yourself to a life promotes a unnatural change in the human body. That's why long term veggie heads and vegans get sick after they eat meat! Same with pure meat eaters who never eat veggies, when they do eat they get sick cause their body had to change.<br>  <br>  Take some common sense in consideration. I hardly ever eat veggies. Only ones I eat are mashed potato's, pepper, and some seasoning. Yet I bet I can sprint the mile better, lift more weight, and any other physical or mental challenge then anyone who chooses a one sided diet.<br>  <br>  So if you pick a one sided diet, I am sorry but your a fool. When you pick a one sided diet your throwing away a lot of good food. You also have to watch what you buy and it takes over your life. <br>  <br>  I hoped enjoyed my message, you arrogant and apathetic veggie/vegan people!|`|IJh7nuW3aa	Hey Im vegetarian by choice - have been since I was 9 and Im now 16 - Vegetarians don't eat meat, chicken or fish but are aloud to eat prawns as they are cold blooded.

stMcVPCMaa	Being a vegetarian is easy - just stop eating meat.... LOL!<br>  <br>  Seriously, the main problem with a vegetarian diet is the difficulty in finding replacement sources of the nutrients you would normally get in meat, particularly protein.  You can't go wrong if you really work on eating a large variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains (the less processed, the better), and focus particularly on high-protein foods like legumes, nuts, cheese, milk, and eggs.  Be careful though, these can be high-calorie foods too!<br>  There are many good books on how to maintain a nutritious vegetarian diet.  If it were me, I'd browse my local bookstore until I found one that makes sense and proposes a diet I know I'll be able to follow.|`|Bk652kDeaa	I became a vegetarian about two years ago. At first, I ate a normal vegetarian diet with fish [which is called pescatarianism]. I think that helped me find other sources of protein while still knowing that I was eating enough meat every week. Eventually I stopped eating fish also, but still ate milk, eggs, nuts, peanut butter, and tofu. I am now back to pescatarianism [salmon is just so good!], but still eat plenty of other protein sources.<br>  <br>  It's very simple! I just recommend reading up on what you should eat to get all the nutrients you need before actually turning into a veggie. I've gotten sick only once since becoming one, and I owe it to my healthy diet!|`|41d76be92aef7c87fe72ee0ffc81a2c3aa	Going vegetarian is a very wise thing for you to do. I would recommend that you should start by phasing out different types of meat every week to ease your body into it. Most meat-eaters eat WAY too much protein and when you go vegetarian it can be a shock to your body. As for staying one, i will tell you that after a month or so you won't want to eat meat anymore. I wish you the best of luck...and for more info you should visit goveg.com.|`|EOy0Dy7zaa	Ok hate looking at raw meat.Dont eat any meat id u hate the texture plus theres better foods.|`|llkSmgLJaa	I became a vegetarian because I never liked the taste of meat either.

llkSmgLJaa	Yes it smells like what it is rotten dead flesh.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I have been a vegan for a long time now, and don't like the smell of meat, but it is not intolerable.  I suppose I have just got used to it. there are lots of nasty smells, but I don't let them intrude.  Milk is probably the worst for me - always smalls rancid and cheesy, no matter how fresh!|`|0fuF2sHbaa	I have a dog and a cat so I'm used to the smell of meat, but I hate the smell of dairy and eggs - scrambled eggs every morning must suck, I didn't even like that smell as a meat eater. <br>  <br>  I can smell dairy on people who consume a lot of it, their sweat smells bitter like rusty iron.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why it happens, but I doubt anybody would like the smell of burning bodies if they didn't think of it as food.|`|nvH62xo5aa	This is normal. I sometimes get sick from the smell of beef.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	no one else is like this, you are a weird-o|`|PBbLDI8iaa	I do sometimes but it's only certain things that bother me. I have always hated the smell of eggs and have never cared much for them. They have always made me sick to me stomach and I can't even be in the same room if someone is cooking them. The smell of chicken doesn't bother me. Chicken use to be my favorite meat so I still kinda like the smell a little, that is if it is fried I mean lol. Any other way I don't really care for the smell. Pork really sets my stomach off though. I was never a big fan of pork and other items from the pig or the way they smelled so that's not too much different. It may be happening because you think too much about it. I think that you might associate the horrors of the production that displease you with the sight and smell. I don't think anything is "wrong" I just think it may be a psychological thing you know? So just stop over thinking about it, okay.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	im a vegan too, the smell of chicken sometimes makes my tummy hurt or queasy. but all other meats are fine and i think steaks smell really good. i never really liked chicken to begin with though. <br>  its probably all in your head, that the smell disgusts you because the thought of eating it, where it comes from, etc. repulses you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  tic-tac, well paavo nurmi was a 1920's olympic vegan runner with 4:10 mile.|`|VSM68mIzaa	Your body is taking a unnatural course!

I cannot stand to be around meat or cheese, the smell just reeks to me and makes me a bit queasy. I hate being in someone's house when they are cooking because when I leave I notice even my clothes reek.|`|IJh7nuW3aa	Ignore these people - Im vegetarian - not quite vegan but fussy with dairy products too. When I smell meat or see it raw I feel really queasy too and often feel like I'm going to be sick - I normally walk out of the room that I can smell it from. Im okaii with yoghurts and some cheeses but milk does it for me - When I see someone drinking milk it actually seems repulsive to me and I can't stand it and I have no idea why - Maybe its because we know whats in it and what it is and thats why we are vegan/ vegetarian - Not 100% but i'd also like to find out - Hope this helped - You are not weird - There are lots of people that are the same when it comes to this x|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	You are not alone. I too feel queasy when people are bar-b-queing flesh foods nearby. It smells like a crematorium to me and it turns my stomach. I cannot be in or drive by certain restaurants either -- for the same reason without an equally negative physical reaction. So I certainly empathize with you. I think it has to do with the purity of your system. The cleaner you are the more sensitive you become. People whose bodies are polluted with flesh foods will not understand what we are saying but do not be upset by it. Just be aware of what is happening and be grateful that you are so sensitized -- it means that you are healthier and cleaner on a physiological level.|`|hcJcC182aa	You have never or at some time developed a dislike for flesh. No problem with you at all. <br>  <br>  No I love it usually eat meat cooked but rarely I will eat it raw. No queasy for me.<br>  I love it and have always loved animal flesh. My father is a butcher and I always enjoyed watching him work cutting the bones and meat into select cuts.<br>  I love dairy too.<br>  <br>  If you have not then it is time to tell your family that meat disgusts you. They will hopefully work with you about the meals selection and eating together.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|renZ4mvWaa	I've pretty much always thought cooking meat smells really bad, especially on the grill, even before going vegan and it's one of the reasons I quit eating meat. Oh, and milk has always smelled awful to me too, to the point where I'd change my shirt if I got any on me while eating so I wouldn't have to smell it all day. The rest of my family thought I was nuts because they think milk doesn't have a scent. <br>  <br>  I don't think my sensitivity to those types of smells has really got any worse since I stopped eating meat, dairy, etc. (maybe because I hated the smells to begin with?), and going by your description I don't think they bother me as much as they do you, but I do know what you mean and it seems a large number of people react the same way. So try not to let it worry you.

This was because President Roosevelt found it exciting to look at fupas of flapper girls. If this was not the case and the United States was also not in a war with Bulgaria during the Bulgarian Missile Crisis then there would not have been a great depression

Stir chocolate until melted. Turn off the heat and let stand.<br>  <br>  Beat the cream over ice until it forms soft peaks. Set aside and hold at room temperature. With a mixer, whip egg to soft peaks. Gradually add the sugar and continue whipping until firm.<br>  <br>  Remove the chocolate and using a whisk, fold in the egg whites all at once. When the whites are almost completely incorporated, fold in the whipped cream. Cover the mousse and refrigerate for approximately 1 hour or until set. Serve in goblets topped with more whipped cream and shaved chocolate, if desired.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Chocolate Mousse<br>  ? 8 ounces chocolate chips <br>  ? 6 tablespoons water <br>  ? 2 teaspoons vanilla <br>  ? 2 cups whipping cream <br>  ? 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar <br>  Directions <br>  1. <br>  Melt chocolate and water in saucepan. <br>  2. <br>  Whisk in the vanilla. <br>  3. <br>  Allow to cool. <br>  4. <br>  Whip the cream. <br>  5. <br>  Add the confectioner's sugar. <br>  6. <br>  On low beater, blend in the chocolate. <br>  7. <br>  Scoop the Chocolate Mousse into a clear, glass bowl. <br>  8. <br>  Garnish with grated chocolate or some of the chocolate from the pan drizzled on top.|`|4CtV47KDaa	Chocolate mousse is a great dessert for entertaining because 1) it looks pretty, 2) everyone gets their own serving, and 3) you can make it a day ahead of time. In fact, you do need to make it at least several hours ahead of time. I decided to prepare chocolate mousse using the darkest chocolate I could find (Trader Joe's has some Belgian 70% cocoa 1 lb bricks). Chocolate mousse is a little bit tricky. If you incorporate the egg yolks when the chocolate is too warm, it will cook, if too cold, it will seize up when the other ingredients are added. If you stir and not fold the egg whites and whipped cream in, your mousse will not be fluffy, but dense.<br>  <br>  Almost all recipes I reviewed called for bittersweet chocolate. From what I can tell, bittersweet has a bit more sugar and a bit less cocoa than the 70% dark chocolate I used. If you are going to serve the mousse straight - with no added cream or fruit, and you love the taste of barely sweet dark chocolate, your mousse will be perfect with the 70%. If you layer in fruit (raspberries complement the chocolate quite well) and or more whipped cream, you'll want either to add sugar or use bittersweet chocolate to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chocolate Mousse Recipe <br>  Print Options<br>  Print (no photos) <br>  Print (with photos) <br>  Ingredients<br>  4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped<br>  2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, diced<br>  2 tablespoons espresso or very strong coffee (I used decaf espresso from a local Starbucks)<br>  1 cup cold heavy cream<br>  3 large eggs, separated<br>  1 tablespoon sugar <br>  <br>  (Optional) Raspberries and extra whipped cream<br>  <br>  <br>  Method<br>  1 Whip the cream to soft peaks, then refrigerate.<br>  <br>  2 Combine the chocolate, butter, and espresso in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not simmering, water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool until the chocolate is just slightly warmer than body temperature. To test, dab some chocolate on your bottom lip. It should feel warm. If it is too cool, the mixture will seize when the other ingredients are added. <br>  <br>  3 Once the melted chocolate has cooled slightly, whip the egg whites in a medium bowl until they are foamy and beginning to hold a shape. Sprinkle in the sugar and beat until soft peaks form.<br>  <br>  4 When the chocolate has reached the proper temperature, stir in the yolks. Gently stir in about one-third of the whipped cream. Fold in half the whites just until incorporated, then fold in the remaining whites, and finally the remaining whipped cream.<br>  <br>  5 Spoon or pipe the mousse into a serving bowl or individual dishes. If you wish, layer in fresh raspberries and whipped cream. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours. (The mousse can be refrigerated for up to a day.) <br>  <br>  Serves 5-8, depending on the size of the servings.|`|AA11180444	<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Heavenly-Chocolate-Mousse/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Heavenly-Ch...</a>

ubukt8WWaa	Cinnamon in chili is common.  If that's the only thing you're tasting, kick up your other spices and ingredients.  Add more chili powder, cumin, garlic or garlic powder.  Is your chili powder fresh?<br>  <br>  Lots of spices start to lose their flavor after about 6 mos in your cupbord.  One common mistake cooks make is to keep spices for years.  They lose much of their flavor.|`|AA11180444	Add more of the tomato ingredient you put in it, that will help!  Trust me!|`|E9sN6xeqaa	Try to balance it out with some Paprika or Chili Powder|`|AA11786341	get some fresh spices from the grocery store

e2HW9iQ5aa	It depends on the liquor.  Some can, especially if stored improperly. Like Wine and Beer. Some, like Whiskey just get better as they age.|`|AA11394457	Yes, especially the ones with a cream base like Baileys, Sheridans or Limoncello.
mX0qaX3Eaa	Certain liqueurs can go off, fruit and cream based drinks will perish for example. Spirits like vodka, whisky and brandy last a long time though and unless they're exposed to pollutants they shouldn't spoil.|`|hLohtlPEaa	Yes, some liquors can go bad. The rule of thumb is if you open it, drink it or cook with it. Don't let it sit around for too long. Sherry is one liquor that doesn't stay for very long after opening.

First of all it depends on the type of beer. Fruity beer is served coldest at 40 to 45 degrees, but I'm thinking you most likely talking about lagers, besides, 3 deg C is too cold for anything, unless you're dringing beer that you really don't want to taste.<br>  <br>  I've attached a link to a nice guide to serving temps.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by the way the temperature affects you?|`|2RAvyY0naa	The colder the better unless it is supposed to be hot like a coffee-type alcoholic beverage.|`|2nsNvIanaa	drink a 6 pak of warm then find out.|`|hLohtlPEaa	I would guess it the alcohol content, not the temp.

In fact, it is closer related to a tomato!! The reason it is called sweet potato is because it appears to have similarities. However, sweet potato is much less starchy and far better for you than potato. Sweet potatoes can be eaten raw, I love grating them with a cheese grater and they look like grated carrot, I put them in salads, I use to make sweet potato wedges out of them too.<br>  <br>  Eat sweet potato rather than a potato. <br>  <br>  Try and add other things into your diet which are similar, such as, butternut squash, turnip, parsnips.
oQs2i4Z9aa	You're still young, and there are millions of guys out there.  I know this isn't what you want to hear, because when I was 15 I was madly in love with the person I was dating as well.  You're going to have to make a choice.  You can ask him to stop hunting and you can even try to educate him about animal rights.  But if he doesn't want to listen, you'll have to make a decision.  What's more important to you?  This boy who doesn't respect the lives of others because he has a gun and they don't?  Or the rights of other animals who haven't done anything to us?|`|b9uOax0aaa	If it bothers you so much you had better get out.|`|XTodi0TYaa	You have to decide if this difference is one that you can live with.

This is a difference we've learned to live with.|`|X9ak9Px2aa	well i also have the same problem, i live in a country where 70% of the men hunt! <br>  The best thing to do is to discuss with them the problem and kindly ask them if they can ignore subjects about animals and hunting where you are around. also when you visit them ask your bf if he can tell at his family to cook vegetarian food.<br>  But ok don't worry you are still very young! you are 15  its only a relationship it doest mean that you will marry the guy.|`|CrYc4TTSaa	He feels just as grounded and strongly about his human rights as you... as you mature you will develop relationships with men who think the same as you.

But have you tried talking to him about it and showing him how horrible it is? I am a vegetarien and I would never be with a hunter but that is just my opinion. If he knew you were considering breaking up with him he would either begin to consider changing his ways for you or not and if that is the case he may not be right for you. I really hope I helped. This is just a suggestion if  you really love him then you can get through this!

They do not answer their phone so you cannot cancel.|`|3DqNexwkaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.

I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.) The site was <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> - All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold, I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

AA12239026	I too have seen many suggest such.<br>  <br>  Not true since it is common to see on news shows those 'human interest' clips towards the end of the show about some animal that has adopted another animal and is suckling it.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	No. Cats and dogs will greedily drink cow's and goat's milk. I've seen dogs on farms actually suckling on goats.<br>  <br>  The thing about milk in nature is that, if it is given, it is taken. It's not the young animals that stop drinking milk by choice. They are cut off. If they weren't cut off they would continue.|`|AA10745041	Although it's not really "milk" per se, there are some species of either termites or ants (I can't remember for sure, but I think the latter) that keep "herds" of aphids that they milk some sort of drinkable liquid from. So we're behind the game when it comes to dairies; the bugs beat us to it by millions of years!|`|5zNwBQZHaa	As far as I know - we are the only ones to do this regularly.  I mean, if you give cow's milk to a cat of course the cat will eat it - but it isn't part of it's normal diet.<br>  <br>  We are also the only animal to drink milk beyond childhood - that of another species of course.<br>  <br>  But we are also the only animal to figure out how to collect and store it, too.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Yes, it is true that we humans, are the only species on this planet to think we need milk from another species after infancy. Pretty pathetic. They haven't told us it's wrong yet because the dairy industry doesn't want to go bankrupt.|`|SUs4rN49aa	No, it's not. When lambs aren't accepted by their mothers, for whatever reason, then they won't be allowed to suckle. Farmers resort to cow's milk for the lambs to drink instead. <br>  The same is done with a lot of orphan animals when you think about it.|`|b9uOax0aaa	I have seen hogs suck from cows on occasion.  I also have seen our dog do it also.  The main reason that other species do not is that they do not have the ability to do so regularly.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Incorrect, we are the only species that has learnt how to farm it. I've seen other animals being used as surrogate mothers. Sheep & goats, sometimes cats and dogs. All animals when young will drink any milk they can. Every animal would drink another animals milk if they could get it, but humans have the intelligence on how to produce large quantities of milk.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Technically, no... Most infant mammals, if you slip them into the litter of another species, will be accepted by the mother and, as far as I know, suckle.<br>  <br>  Obviously, this is a situation fairly unlikely to happen without human intervention, but it makes drinking milk seem slightly less the unnatural act that that popular 'fact' makes it sound.|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	Yes.  We're also the only species to drink milk as adults, and the only ones that have to burn dead flesh to make it "safe" to eat.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Cat's drink from dogs, and dog's drink from cats.

6yoLxKuYaa	It's not, in moderation. Unless you have health conditions that it would affect, or phsychlogical factors, such as anxiety or depression or ESPECIALLY insomnia. people who struggle with those have no business with coffee.

ILpp3ncYaa	That counts.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	What kind of juice? Natural juice? Organic? Or those from the store filled with preservatives & artificial flavors? Well if you consume natural juice or organic juice it can keep you hydrated in a positive way but fruits originally have sugar which can make you overweighted. And the artificial flavored with preservatives juice is even worse. High in sugar, calories, carbs, or even sodium. But honestly you really need natural water sometimes to purify your body & take all the waste out from your body. Juice can keep you hydrated but leaves those other ingredients in your body. Water cleans ur body while keeping you clean? it can help maintaining your kidneys in good condition, for example. So just try to drink some water. It purifies you, keeping ur internal body clean & healthy. Just add a slice of lemon on ur water for flavor.GOOD BYE(*_*)|`|dYoWEJ3Raa	its okay as long as you stay hydrated|`|HHgXSZUcaa	you need water to live. i would not recommend not drinking water i hate to drink water but lots of problems can come by not drinking water<br>  <a href="http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education/water-health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-e...</a>|`|pVdV4gwgaa	That is weird.

Water hydrates you faster, and is better for you after you work out because it replaces the electrolytes lost through sweat, while juice doesn't. Start slowly giving up all this juice (which by the way is very high in sugar and calories) and drink at least 4, but up to 8 or 10 cups of water every day.

Might not feel the greatest, but it helps get that alcohol out of your body a bit faster. Best cure - bacon, eggs and toast.

Therefore to flush  it out, drink lot's of water.|`|GjBNXIYXaa	A Hangover is usually caused due to dehydration.  In the military when we have a hang over we just give each other I.V.s.

I'd love to know where they are getting their alcohol from. Even if they are taking it from their parents houses, the parents can be responsible for anything that happens to any of those kids before, during, and after the party. If someone is buying it for them, they can be arrested.  Now that you know you don't like being drunk, I hope you won't do it again.  You don't have to. Be careful if you continue to party with them. If the police are ever called to one of their parties, you will be taken to the police station along with everyone else underage and you'll have to call your parents to explain the situation.  Maybe that will help you to decide. Maybe you'll stop going to these parties, get involved with something constructive, like join a church youth group or do some volunteer work for an organization you might enjoy. Such as Habitat For Humanity, Your local Humane Society, Special Olympics, Tutoring younger children at the Boys and Girls Club, etc. You'll make a whole new group of friends who are doing something useful with their time!

GSJ9gqVWaa	You are 16, and I guess not used to alcohol as you are asking this question.  You are also very, very light, even for your height.  At your age I was at least 20 lbs heavier, and I am very skinny.  Based on my friends about your age, but a bit more experienced with alcohol, I would say you will act differently from one small can of beer.  Neither my friends nor me get really smashed, so I can't tell you how much would get you drunk off your head.  Very lightly drunk is 1 - 2 cans for me and my friends, so lightly drunk for you might be 1 can, just nicely drunk might be 2 small cans.  4 or more cans would probably be too much for you.  <br>  <br>  You are very small for your age, so alcohol will effect you very quickly.<br>  <br>  You are only 16, so the latest medical advice is that you should still be taking it easy with alcohol.  I would say that, especially as you are so small, you shouldn't drink more than 1-2 small cans of normal strength beer on a very regular basis, or 3-4 very rarely.<br>  <br>  It is very hard to tell how you will respond to alcohol.  A friend of mine who is 17 had 5 whiskies in one night, and I couldn't really tell the difference, but he has the sort of personality that is very outgoing.  That would put many people seriously out of it.<br>  <br>  It is best to build up slowly.  You might want to see how you feel about what you did after 2 beers in the morning, before you try 4 beers.  You might also want to see how bad a hangover you have before deciding to drink more.<br>  <br>  Based on your height and weight, you are underweight.  I suggest you see your doctor just to check you are alright.|`|cezaZQQsaa	3 beers - lightweight|`|SbH5c7jdaa	not many ,because you don't weigh a lot. you are too young to drink anyways.|`|eSqsYYoDaa	Not much at all...4-6|`|WPH6O73gaa	1-2...<br>  Wait a few more years|`|XzLUA7ataa	Only a couple beers would do it, two or three.|`|kZFfUMsoaa	drink 10 and fall down again|`|FYNqBIryaa	If you consume 2 1/2-3 beers within an hour your BAC will be approx .08, which is the legal limit in the US. <br>  <br>  There is no precise answer as this rate can very with a few factors.

L8x9R4p1aa	The best I've ever had is from a locally owned seafood restaurant. They tell me their secret is a ton of fresh chopped clams and heating the cream, but never letting it come to a boil.|`|m13Se2dAaa	This one from epicurious.com.

pVdV4gwgaa	Yes. A fiber bar was your meal! Of course you are goign to be hungry! It's dinner time! :)|`|038cPKt6aa	yes|`|0ectWZxAaa	yes you should|`|AA11402528	um lets see .. yeah|`|IjTXOTzvaa	yes probably|`|UXmgHs4Uaa	yes...you should prob eat a snack now and then you should be fine till the rest of the night|`|w7q8GUcmaa	Yes! you should eat around 18 servings a day. That was, what, 1? maybe 2? <br>  And it's better to eat small snacks more often than big meals once or twice|`|2ak34u4qaa	Yes|`|WZAwlAHaaa	lol of course!|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Should be.
UXmgHs4Uaa	yes but there are alternative healthier breakfast foods. But if pancakes are the only thing to eat in the morning then go for it. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and you need some food source in the morning to start your metabolism.|`|1cd4b4483ad121c243e7ab5d39b4f29baa	Make your own oatmeal or whole wheat pancakes (trader Joe's has a mutli grain) add bananas and pecans (can you tell I am from the south?). Dust with just a tiny bit of powdered sugar. Not great for you but better than pancakes with syrup.|`|x1Bclpcaaa	If t eat yogurt and fruit on it!! O its sooo good! Some times i eat it without the fruit and jus yogurt. But try it. Yummy and healthy!|`|0ectWZxAaa	Healthiest would probably be oatmeal.|`|PyUr3l8caa	blueberry pancakes are healthier.|`|HHgXSZUcaa	lol. no not really im sure there are some forms of pancakes that are healthy. go to food network .com and type in whole wheat pancakes|`|IjTXOTzvaa	no if you put on lots of syrup, butter and other stuff|`|850qv6g1aa	no!!|`|MS6IzOPLaa	They are fine if you don't go overboard on the syrup.  Make sure to have some fruit and a glass of milk to make it a complete breakfast.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	not the healthiest, but it beats bacon and some other things people have for breakfast, especially if u add fruit to them and organic syrup is actually healthy for u. Either way i love them!|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Generally, no. They can be, use fresh fruits.|`|AA11402528	depends what kind of flour you use, and the amount of butter, syrup etc you put on them and how many you eat|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|KGOxYkh7aa	no.
wa3AvezGaa	Fermentation time will depend upon several factors such as temperature, yeast strain used, starting sugar level of the juice, etc.  In general, if you use a proper wine yeast and keep the temperature within the proper range for the type of yeast, fermentation should be complete within 10-14 days at the most, probably more like 7 for a cider.  You don't need to worry about methanol... there will always be a small amount of methanol in the final product (as there is in all ciders and fruit wines), but the level will be very low and not a health risk.  Unless you plan on drinking it right away, it will be quite unstable due to low alcohol content.  That is unless you add sugar to the starting must to boost the final alcohol thereby making a fruit wine, rather than a cider.|`|TRUpkxWwaa	the methynol wil make you blind cuz if you dont know how long it will take you probably dont know what you are doing.
kEgXrX0saa	Take a tablespoon of flour and stir in hot water, if it swells up its most likely self rising flour, if it just stays about the same its plain. Hope this helps
ebb9e0b9207c9d02bc3f30d9a45ff8a0aa	Not unless the ice is somehow contaminated, you are outside in the freezing cold and without clothing.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	No, ice doesn't have any viruses in it.|`|3sWRv9xEaa	if u didnt smoke weed u wouldnt have that problem<br>  <br>  and to answer you question no u cant get phnemonia|`|hOEQMnBOaa	You can buy bongs with ice catchers which are nice but honestly what I do is use mint mouth wash for water the vapor is really cool.
InvPKVJ7aa	$20 a person would be more than enough I think
MS6IzOPLaa	It's not too bad for you.  Try using nonfat yogurt and ice cubes instead of ice cream, or low fat ice cream to make it healthier.  You have almost 2 servings of fruit here so at least it's a start!  Enjoy!|`|Nhje1U06aa	High in sugar its a good dessert but its a milkshake - try adding some yogurt instead of the icecream   and blueberries for anti oxidents<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  for my lil girl I use organic vanilla yogurt a little skim milk a banana and handful of frozen or fresh blueberries it taste really yummy!!!!|`|635cf52bb9798114e759826efa24d70aaa	mmm sounds like a yummy shake,For a smoothie that's healthy omit ice cream use yogurt and some protein powder I have one every morning gives you a kick start for the day.|`|E9sN6xeqaa	Its 50/50. We use Lemon Sorbet, Bananas, Strawberries, Orange Juice and Ice. The bananas help keep it on the thicker side.|`|YY3ZLpiWaa	it's healthy and unhealthy because it has fruits and it has ice cream|`|1bcYl6SKaa	If you want it healthy try this.<br>  <br>  Use vanilla fat free yogurt<br>  or plain fat free yogurt (with 3 tbs of honey)<br>  freeze the fruit <br>  and then blend<br>  <br>  Much much healthier lower fat, lower calories, higher protein<br>  <br>  <br>  The reason it is so good is that you are making milkshakes
sG5FKmAYaa	You use it like you would regular honey. When it gets cold it can become difficult to spread but it shouldn't require heating.<br>  Store at room temperature in a cupboard.<br>  <br>  Clover Honey is supposed to be white and quite firm. I see from your other answer she may not know of it.<br>  Clover Honey is quite common here.<br>  I take it you both are more used to regular liquid honey|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Microwave it.|`|GEOHQu4Taa	You should use it just like any other honey.  I don't known why yours is solid and white, unless it's cold.  Mine looks and tastes just like any other honey.

The allrecipes link is great because you can read reviews and get other cooks' input.<br>  <br>  My favorite McCormick's recipe uses the BBQ Pulled Pork Seasoning. I use 3-4 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of pork. After cooking in the crock pot until the chicken is tender, shred the chicken and return to the crock pot. Add one cup of your favorite BBQ sauce and cook on low for another hour or two. It's the best for sandwiches, topping baked potatoes, or even on a big salad. Leftovers keep in the frig, great for a busy mom.|`|635cf52bb9798114e759826efa24d70aaa	Sign up for my recipes.com I love this site you can read comments of recipes before you make them and they send you recipes about 2 a-day,I save the ones I know I'll use in future.There is also other sites they tell you about Fantastic|`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	i def recommend allrecipes.com, it is amazing.<br>  bbc.co.uk/food<br>  foodnetwork.com|`|7LRGgHszaa	<a href="http://supremerecipes.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://supremerecipes.blogspot.com/</a>|`|E9sN6xeqaa	pillsbury.com...For example, I buy the crescent rolls and they have dinners, snacks and desserts!
