If it is not there then CLICK on RICH TEXT and PLAIN TEXT should appear with the tool bar.<br>  <br>          1. Select the text for which you want to change the font<br>          2. Now click the font button (F, second in the toolbar) and u get the list of available fonts, select the one you desire.<br>          3. you can also change the text size using the same toolbar.<br>  <br>          move you mouse over each button to know what it does.<br>  <br>          well this is i how you change the font while composing an email. If you are asking about changing the fonts of entire yahoo email view try clicking on TOOLS at the top of your screen and then CONTENT. Depending what Yahoo you are in...IE:Firefox..you might have to click on Tools..Internet Options and then CONTENT...You can do many things with the FONT. You will have to experiment<br>  <br>          good luck<br>  <br>          ....Have a great day...................

I have no problem with the other kinds of people because I can accept that that's just the way they are and that's alright. Even if I don't get along with those kinds of people, they can only be themselves. But the person you described in number four is someone who is self-righteous and someone who would try to change me and wouldn't accept me as I am, based on the fact that you said they would scold people. I try to accept everyone for who and what they are, even if I don't agree and I don't like it when people don't do the same... especially when they tie it into religion. It really sickens me.

sK3qibRwaa	It will be truth always!|`|AA10202389	That's true, in this earth. Some people get rigid though, thinking they understand the truth. They assume their understand of a scripture is complete. Paul indicated that there is a literal and a spiritual side to a scripture. And the prophets show that there is a minor and major fulfillment of prophecy, so I'm told. What you see from one side of a mountain is true, but there is more information from someone standing on the other side. What may be good for me at one time may be bad for someone else at another. What's true in macro physics can be reversed by Quantum Physics. What we know can be nullified by what we don't know. A shallow view of scriptures can be inaccurate for detail. And God can fulfill prophecy in ways we didn't expect. And if man can't guide his own step, then a group of men, or preachers, can be worse at it and certainly can't guide my step, only the Spirit can, although it says to try the spirits, test what they say. Of course, if we'd rather be right all the time, everyone can all follow us, but Paul said not to follow him. If we can't follow him, what man can we follow.  Science is beginning to show that matter changes from a particle to a wave and disappears altogether. So it's real and not real. It's a creation and something is only real for this creation or a certain circumstance. Paul said all things are lawful and Isaiah, there is a time for everything. The law is good, but it enslaves and is done away with. Those aren't contradictions, but different circumstance and conditions or how we interpret the scriptures. One way at one time and another at another because we live in an ever changing universe of infinite complexity and it's the living word for life and can be applied to many circumstances. Even time speeds up and slows down. Certainly we've seen that in scriptures. Everything is true in a sense and untrue in another sense or time. The law is a guidepost, but not a god. The truth is stated in words, but they have unlimited definitions depending on the words they are used with and context. So often people who say the truth is the truth, mean they know it. The statement is true, but a rigid stance is the wrong spirit, but that's what we do. I'm certainly no exception. OK, so I said nothing we don't know, but we need flexibility in applying a scripture by it's spirit, as the literal kills, but the spirit brings life. The deeper we understand a scripture the more we can handle the law lawfully. It says to try the spirits to see if it's from God. Our problem is not listening to God and thinking we have the truth. It's like Jesus said, how is it the gentiles do the things of the law, not having the law, and you having the things of the law do them not? It's when we don't understand how law works. Sometimes we have to do what seems to be the opposite of a scripture and there is another scripture which covers that case too. Cases alter law. Maybe this will be useful to someone who can't "bend like a read" as Jesus recommended. The ones who keep talking about infallibility, although preachers don't spell it out, that's how they are taken, are just using mind control and setting themselves up as gods or the ones manipulating them or us, probably more correctly. The anti-Christ is already here. We're already in the power of the wicked one and the judgment begins in the church, probably because that's where he is and the worst blasphemies are occurring and trying to destroy the earth. The truth is the opposite of what we think and the churches in Jesus' day are a lesson for today, full of dead men's bones. They killed Him for saying things like that. The truth hurts.<br>  What do you do with Quantum Physics that says we see what we believe. It's seems we create a lot of truth in more ways than one.|`|S0LY9jvbaa	depends on d nature of d people..there may b a contraversy in d nature.in all matter 1 wud think dt it is lie n 1 wud think dt it is true..|`|JZTFl0bxaa	Or can a truth just be a truth and a lie just be a lie?

It only seems to come up AFTER you type at least 20 characters in the base question -- and does not STAY up once you go to the 'additional details' area, if I remember correctly.

Did you report the answer itself, or the person directly to the team? If yours was the only report of abuse on that answer, it may not have been enough to get it removed. If they are admitting to copying other answers, you might want to try this technique: Copy what they stated, report the answer, type 'cheater' in the text box -- and PASTE their statement there, adding that this is what they themselves admitted to. This might get some action.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, 'everybody' reported the top person on the global leaderboard as a point-gamer, for months, and it took forever to get that person suspended, finally.

To be adult, you would have to verify ages.  That is almost impossible to do and it costs money.  With all the free question sites, nobody would pay for it.  Many of the news sites and political sites have chat rooms you use.  They are much more strict than YA and they will all be biased based on the population of users.  A list of such sites is given as a reference.

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.

XDOfrdn1aa	Hello Nerd Pride,<br>  <br>  Well not necessarily. Yahoo is getting crazy! violations every second of the day! This is cause by "Trolls". Trolls are nasty people that always report answers and try to remove them, also they are very negative towards the rating system. Also there are people that can't stand better answers an theirs and will always try to fight for best answer by reporting the better answers.These nonsense is very unnecessary and i think yahoo should remove the thumbs up and down rating system because it drives people mad!<br>  <br>  Best Regards,<br>  Preciosa R|`|mVUpt8waaa	You are actually not supposed to use Yahoo Answers as a place to rant and rave about something.  It is supposed to be a Q & A site.  So you might be getting reported for that.<br>  <br>  Other people just dont want to hear other peoples point of view.  If they disagree with you for any reason they will report you.|`|sxb0jX8qaa	I remember seeing a question about One Piece Haters allowed to say why they hated it and only one person actually did.

uhZ38xYkaa	I ? mine very much!<br>  <br>  Pros: Great games( Halo 3, Call of Duty 4 and 5, Gears of War 2, etc..), can play music, videos, movies, has Xbox Live, Xbox Live Marketplace, and millions of customizable features. There is a couple of different types of Xbox 360's:<br>  Xbox 360 Core(not too many being sold; $210), not recommended. Xbox 360 Arcade($199). Xbox 360 Pro 20GB($265). Xbox 360 Pro 60GB(the one I have; $300). Xbox 360 Elite($399). <br>  <br>  Cons: Has a 6%-12% failure rate(depending on model) which can be bad, but it comes with a Microsoft Warranty which is also faulty. It takes about 8 Weeks to get it back and 40% of the time it doesn't work because they don't replace it, they TRY and fix it. It can get costly because I recommend buying it at Best Buy which you can purchase either:<br>  a. a $60 replacement warranty which is good because you walk in(which is what I am going to do tonight because mine broke) and they hand you a new one(with the option to keep your old Hard Drive) and leave.<br>  or...<br>  b. a $40 fixing plan where it is either saving $20 bucks, or wasting your time+money. They will try and fix CERTAIN things and if they can't fix the CERTAIN things, they will give you a new one. Problem is if it is a 'mis-treated' Xbox 360, they won't try to fix it, where as ther replacement warranty will. <br>  [I recommend choice 'a' ]<br>  <br>  Choose Xbox 360 if you want to enjoy a vast selection of E-M rated games, from sports to shooters, and from kids to horror, it doesn't get better than that. It plays music(just not on the go) and movies(not on the go as well), but manages to keep you occpupied. Be %50 sure that you are willing to make a return trip to Best Buy for your warranty though.|`|bYrGGOynaa	Okay well I can't answer your question completely but I LOVE the 360 definitely the best console ever. Left 4 Dead is a really cool concept game and Unreal Tournament is the best shooter fo sho, Fallout 3 looked pretty cool but I never got in to it. And of course Halo and Gears of War, and Call of Duty, but I kind of suck at those, a little. But the 360 is super awesome, believe me. Oh and I'm a chick :D<br>  <br>  Oh also kind of a not so great thing it can overheat really really bad.. but it can do so many other things!!! connect to itunes from your computer if you have live!!!|`|LKZlcjgVaa	its cool. though if youre buying it for games id recommend playstation 3.
suPD7c3gaa	First make sure you have the photo/image file that you want to use as your avatar on your computer. (IMPORTANT!  DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with.  You must use 'normal' size image files.)  Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right. If not, you'd need to create one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/">http://360.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  To be sure your image meets proper specifications:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a><br>  <br>  To add a photo to 360: Go to your 360 page. Click on "My Page" that's near the top. You'll see your photos (or where they would be if you don't already have photos there) and the option to "Edit Personal Photos". Click on that, then you will see where you can add photos. Click on "Choose File" to find the image on your computer. Once you add the image, click on "Save". That'll bring you back to the group of images. If you want to set the new image as primary to use here, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again. Click where it says "Set as Primary", then click "Save.<br>  <br>  Then to use your 360 image here for your avatar, go to your profile (Click on your avatar or click "My Profile" on the upper right of the page), the click on "Edit my info". Scroll down to where you choose what image you want to use and choose the 360 one. Then click on "preview" and "OK".<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that sometimes, after following all the steps, the 360 image can appear right away, or can take 2-3 days... but it will eventually appear.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on “Edit My Info”. If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”. If you have not created your 360 profile, there will be a link next to it that says something like “Get my 360 profile now!” Click on it; it will be the easiest to use for the below.<br>  <br>  Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient.

They will not reply to the thousands of people with Yahoo glitchs at this time. They know there are problems and I'm sure they are working on them. I've had problems that took a week before they corrected them in the past.They always tell you to go to Yahoo Answers for help. I used to have a Yahoo tech support email address but they did not respond to that either.

8wlVEpFlaa	Hello, ericayala50518<br>  <br>  How to delete your questions: For OPEN questions - after it has been posted, click on the pencil icon that says: Edit and scroll down. Then see Delete question and click on it. Then click OK if you are sure that you want to delete the question. There! You have deleted a question, but you won't receive the 5 points back for asking the question. For RESOLVED OR IN-VOTING/UNDECIDED questions - You can NOT delete them yourself. It now belongs to Yahoo! property and ONLY if you have enough reports from the community to remove the question, then it will be removed and deleted, but you LOSE a EXTRA 10 points for the violation of the question. Other than that, you can NOT delete them yourself. The ONLY time to delete your question is when the question is OPEN. Sorry! Best wishes and hope it helps!<br>  ??|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Once they are resolved you can not delete them.  You can report them ,if they are some elses questions, if they are not appropriate (not sure if you can do that after it is resolved either)|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Underneath your question is a pencil with the word EDIT next to it. You click on the pencil, and either three or four tabs will pop down, and one will read DELETE QUESTION. You click on that, and it's done. You can only delete questions if they are open. If they are closed and in voting, the only way to delete them is by reporting them. Even then, it's up to the Yahoo! Answers team to decide whether the question is deletion-worthy, or if it violates the guidelines.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	You can't delete resolved questions unless you make a special request to yahoo. (no guarantee) Once a question is resolved it becomes the property of yahoo.<br>  You can delete open questions. Go to the question and on the tool bar at the bottom use the pencil icon.

EdBvqVuLaa	yes, to me it's helpful. I've found out quite a few helpful things from it. And some questions on here don't help in the educational way, but more of the way of humor and making my day better. Like the question, "will you accept my roses..?" or "how do you flush a toilet(believe me, this was asked before)".|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Yahoo Answers is certainly not a place to argue or insult others. That is against the rules of Yahoo Answers. Some answers are helpful and some are just not helpful. Here is some information if you need it.

Click on "Edit My Avatar" or something like that in the blue print. Then a page should come up. Then you make the avatar. Return to Yahoo Answers and go to the Edit My Info page and select the last one as your avatar. To make a picture for a avatar. You need to have a Yahoo 360 account which everyone has. You can acess it with your Yahoo account. Go there and "Edit your personal pictures". Then you click on browse. Then you find a picture you want and click on "Submit". Then click on the picture and it will show up big. Then go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". And click on "Use My 360 Pic".

It means you got reported 2 or 3 times and got your answers removed.  <br>  <br>  WARNING:  If it happens again and you know for a fact you are following the community guidelines, then hide your Questions and Answers as troll(s) are following you and reporting you for no reason.

7u77AiBjaa	There is a sitewide glitch preventing the embedding of videos (and other flash-based objects like music players, photo slideshows, and other widgets) in the blog area of 360. This problem started in late September 2008. On some old entries, clicking the "Comment" link or going the entry's "Permanent Link" will allow you to see some objects. So, embedding videos (as opposed to just linking to them) takes some additional steps.<br>  <br>  These are the remaining ways to incorporate music into your 360 space using a video or a MP3 file:<br>  <br>  1) BLAST<br>  See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=548">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=916">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for details on how to put music in your blast. You can use music that you upload to the web or music already uploaded to the web by other people (faster, easier method).<br>  <br>  The song file must be an MP3 file and the web address for that file must end in .mp3. Also, only certain services (music hosting sites, file hosting sites, or blogging services) will allow you to create or use a hotlink to an audio file. So, if you use a search engine to find links, you should definitely check to see if it's working on your page after saving your blast.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) BLOG<br>  <br>  EMBEDDING MUSIC VIDEO:<br>  Thanks to the help of some 360 users, they have come up with a few ways for you to embed videos outside of the normal help instructions (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/blog/blog-33.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/blo...</a> ):<br>  <br>  1) A simple deletion of parts of the YouTube video embed code works.

MINy26pjaa	First of all, you should answer questions in the categories that you know the most about.  Research the question to be sure you have all your facts straight and correct.  Put thought and detail into your answers, but not so much detail that the person has to read a ‘book’ to get to the answer.  :D  <br>  <br>  Look at the answers that have already been given and don’t say the same thing that someone else has already said unless you know a way to say it more clearly or explain it better.  I know that sometimes this isn’t possible, because other people may submit their answers while you are typing yours, or busy doing your research, and you won’t see them before you submit yours, but you should at least make the effort.<br>  <br>  If you used research in your answer, provide a link so the questioner can look there, and possibly get more information.  <br>  <br>  Use proper grammar and spelling in your answers. Perhaps most importantly, always be polite, courteous and friendly and never make the questioner feel that they have asked a stupid question.<br>  <br>  If you follow these guidelines, I’m sure your best answer percentage will soon rise.  Good luck!|`|dheSY1bYaa	They only answer the questions they know they have a chance of getting "best answer" on. Some users simply spam out a smart reply/one-liner to get the 2 points. As a result their best answers percentage is low.
rctF3Ylxaa	Ya!  I mean its like, your gonna get 10 points if you get chosen anyway! That bugs me too but I dident know if anyone else thought so too!|`|AA11767291	Well it's a combination of amusingly annoyed because I think duh, the best answer means 10 points anyway. Most of the time I won't answer those ; maybe because I prejudge it when I spot that. However, if the question were to catch my eye before the ten points quotation , I may answer because it was interesting. Points don't entice me to do anything.|`|suPD7c3gaa	It's about as annoying as people who give an answer to a question, and then say "Hope I helped".  Kissing up is never attractive.  We are all here to help.  I usually won't answer those questions that offer points.  And most people who say it, don't even choose a Best Answer.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Its annoying.<br>  <br>  I also hate when people link their own question and offers no solution to yours.|`|MINy26pjaa	They are trying to advertise the fact that they are one of the people that actually WILL chose a best answer.  The majority of people just let their questions go to community vote and those very often end up in ties, so no one ever gets the 10 points.<br>  <br>  I only find it annoying when it turns out that they don't pick a best answer after all.  Then I find it MORE than annoying!|`|Ex79fiD9aa	It was annoying at first, but after a while you get used to it. Promising ten points is nothing more than a rather lame attempt at attracting attention to a question.<br>  <br>  Some take it an additional step by offering ridiculous amounts like fifty points, or ten points to everyone who answers.
f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	They're found in links to external sites. The thing to do is to be careful about the links you follow. I always hover over links and make sure they lead to a site I've heard of, like youtube.com or something like that. If you're not sure, don't click on links that you see in Q&A's. Report any that you know are virus links.<br>  <br>  Some of the bad ones have URL's that look like they are Yahoo! sites, but they aren't. Yahoo itself should be safe. The whole point is to infect your computer to either steal information, to add software that is doing something illegal, or is just plain childish and designed to screw your pc up.<br>  <br>  The sort of people doing it are organised criminals and little nerds with mental issues.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is no way to get a virus from Yahoo Answers.

Read the guidelines|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Was this the ENTIRE question? Or were there links included?<br>  <br>  Questions are prescreened for certain words and/or phrases, to help spot violations. Flagged questions are held for staff review. So some questions may not post for hours – or may get violated by staff. Delayed questions will be off the front page, so get very few answers.<br>  <br>  This also sometimes seems to happen 'randomly', as in a randomly selected sample question.<br>  <br>  If you are posting questions with links in them, this can delay the question posting or even cause it to not post. To get around this, post the question without the link first, then return to the question and use the PENCIL under it to put the link in the ‘additional details’ section.

There are top contributors who are at level two, and there are level seven users who aren't top contributors. Rather, being a top contributor has to do with how well you contribute to one to three different categories, excluding Jokes & Riddles and Polls & Surveys. If you keep receiving the best answer in the category or categories that you participate in, you will eventually receive the top contributor badge(s). Good luck!|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	A top contributor is someone who is knowledgeable in up to three categories. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular category and is said to be reviewed weekly. the top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time.

Stop judging, for your sanity and joy, love your enemy, thanksgiving and think on whatever praiseworthy thing there is. Any one of those will probably do. You can't expect a cake, if you don't follow the instructions. Even if a friend brings one over, unloving people don't have many friends. If you want radical results, follow it radically, excessively for a while. <br>  So if you listen to that still small voice inside, spoken of in Ezekiel and ask it questions and test it to see if it is from God, as scriptures say. And if it proves true, then it is the spirit of truth and will lead you into all truth. You only have to believe and believe means do it rigorously and it will work. Prove the scriptures wrong.

74b1a45aed1caad0d2bcce7ef63fd10daa	freecycle - as an idea - has been around for a few years.  They don't really have a website, but use Yahoo Groups to send messages to users in the various areas.<br>  <br>  This can be a big problem with local recycling through freecycle.  Simple things, like seeing which items are still available, are impossible.<br>  <br>  That's part of the reason that we built LocalDataPlace.  It has a lot of benefits over freecycle for local recycling (many of which are listed on the home page).<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.

AA11307940	You can't, it's not in Yahoo's programming for the homepage. They already removed it from the mail screen when they upgraded the classic mail.
AA11307940	The Yahoo homepage with the red Y can't be changed. The homepage with the house can. You can add things to it and remove them. Mine is AT&T powered by Yahoo.
