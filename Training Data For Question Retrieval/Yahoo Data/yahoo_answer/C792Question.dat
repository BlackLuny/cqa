I like Evan Williams (black label, not green) as an inexpencive whisky but wanted to get some feedback on how Kentucky Deluxe compares.       Rumour has it that it's like an inexpencive version of Crown Royal, kinda like how Evan is an inexpencive version of Jack Daniels.      Please only contribute if you've had both K.D. and Evan black and can therefore give an unbiased comparasion based on personal experience.      Thank you for your time.

20090307184048AAI0SOq	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	I'm feeling guiltly...is this really vegetarian?	My family and I went to Chiles today and I was STARVING. They had nothing on the menu that wasn't steak or chicken and I was about to just eat the tortilla chips and hit my head on the table.      But my mother pointed out the 'Southwest Vegatable Soup' and the description was 'a vegetarian tomato soup with...." lots of veggies. So I figured if they went through the trouble of saying the broth was vegetarian, the soup must be.       When I got the soup, it looked really good. But when I had a few bites of it, I started to feel really guilty from some reason. I didn't finish it.      Have you ever eaten at Chiles? Do you think this is just because I was wasn't 100% certain that it didn't have meat in it that I felt that way? Have you ever done this?      I feel really bad now.

I believe it would be more reasonable to tax pop than a lot of other things.

20090307200850AAkVCrK	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	All the breading fell off my chicken? How do I make it crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside?	I made my first attempt ever at cooking chicken. It was delicious!! But the breading was like, sliding off!  Here's what I did.      I used boneless, skinless chicken breast.  Put it in some seasoned flour, covering it.  Dipped it in a beaten egg.  Covered it with bread crumbs. I got plain bread crumbs, but added italian seasonings and a little parmesan cheese.  Then I filled the pan with vegetable oil.  I filled it enough to cover half the chicken.  I basically let it sit in there until it was time to flip it over, and until it was cooked all the way through (which, by the way, took a good 45 minutes, when everyone on here told me 5 minutes per side!)  Then again, it was a nice sized chicken breast.      The chicken was nice and juicy, but the breading was FAR from crunchy and was literally sliding off.  I want it to be crunchier! What should I do? Should I have baked it? How do I do that?

20090307194958AAK1hMJ	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	If you eat all of one colored food for an entire day will your poo be that color?	So last St. Patty's Day I drank an S-Load of green beer and ate an S-Load of green bagels and at the bar they had made green fries so I ate an S-Load of those. The next day my poo was green for the entire day. Then yesterday I was at a "PINK" party (for my 11 year old niece's birthday) and all the food was pink or red. So I woke up this morning and again my poo was red in color... Basically if I ate nothing but marshmallows all day long would my poo be white?
