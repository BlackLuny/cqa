Hi there all,  I'm writing a novel and I just wanted to know what you guy's think about the characters and the story line.  Be totally brutally honest, cause criticism is the only way to grow in my writing.        So far I have the story revolving around a girl, Charlotte Griffith, a senior in high school who moves with her mother, Elise Griffith, to Enderby, British Columbia.  And they moved from California so Elise is psyched but Charlotte is far from happy about the move.  And Charlotte is having to go to a whole new school and everything like that, and she is sorta the out cast because everybody has been freinds at that school since they where like 2 and she is the newbie.  And she is totally unhappy until she becomes friends with Garret (Senior in high school) ,  Felicity (Senior) , and Westley (Freshman) Fife who are all emancipated minors who's parents "died", but actually they are shape shifters (Wen I say shape shifters I mean like can change into any animal they want at any time) who don't age and they are not biologically related in anyway, but they all live together.  And Charlotte falls in love with Garret.      And that's about how far I've gotten in the story and thee will be a big conflict to make it more interesting but i just haven't really thought of one yet...  I'm working on it though!

One was dirty rich and famous and the other was a forgotten homeless person; which one would you save? You can only save one.      If you are tempted to say that you would save the homeless, please think again, because the rich was shouting that he/she would give   you half of his/her fortune (a mere 20 billion dollars). The poor homeless person can only offer you a look of disbelief and disgust when he/she realises that you are going to accept the rich persn's offer.      So, how long would it take for you to save the rich person?         Thanks a lot.

20090226173033AAtyTsK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this sound interesting as a story?	It's about a girl who's into some really cool things, or at least she things so, until she starts high school and begins to get made fun of. She stops liking those things and takes up other things that she would have never dreamed of doing. Smoking, drinking, fooling around with guys... and other stuff like that. Then one day she's going through the lost and found trying to find a pair of sunglasses she lost, when she finds an old binder... HER old binder. Pictures of her old favorite bands, idols, and tv shows cover the front of it. she soon changes her ways, even the smoking and drinking with some help from her parents and rehab center, and becomes her old self, not caring what other people think about her.         it is interesting?

20090226172217AAL4Uy8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Wuthering Heights Paper: Can someone help me re-write my thesis?	Here's my intro...the thesis towards the end just seems a little awkward..any suggestions? Thanks      ******Specifically the part about futhering the will of the author and pushing the boundaries of love,revenge,and human compassion.   The setting of the novel Wuthering Heights is a place on the outer edges of society, where typical social and moral norms do not apply. The moors on which the story takes place are as wild and unruly as the characters that inhabit it ,creating a parallel to the uninhibited way in which the characters lead their lives. From the uncivilized and ruthless way characters behave towards each other, to the fierce passion that burns the fuel of Catherine and Heathcliff’s love affair; the separation of Wuthering Heights from civilization furthers the will of the author to explore the boundaries and lack thereof of love, revenge, and human compassion.

Please tell me if you would read it, burn it, etc. lol   Also constructive criticism is welcome. :]      It can be difficult, after experiencing enough trauma, to go back to where the problems originated. After all, emotional abuse does leave a scar- a scar larger and darker than any corporal neglect you could ever suffer.     I walked along the darkened street unconsciously. Something in my mind, or maybe my heart, had brought me there after all the years. As I came to a near driveway, I squinted ahead to read the rusty letterbox. 239 Maple Lane- the exact address I’d been searching for. When I came to it, I stroked the numbers, the black paint flaking off onto my fingers. This was all real; it wasn’t a dream anymore.      I hurried by them with an upset stomach as an undesirable memory came into my head. There was the tree and the swing. A small girl- me- was being pushed on the swing by a man- my father. I must have been very young- four or five years old.     “Higher Daddy! Higher, higher!” I shouted. He pushed harder, but the swing did not go much higher. “Pweeeease, Daddy. Mommy can make me go higher than you!” I cried.    “It’s always about her,” He sneered the name. “Isn’t it?” I felt a final push- a rough push and then I was on the pavement, and my father was gone.       Thats all folks, hey its a work in progress so don't get all five star critic on me :D

20090226173450AAb2i4p	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is the value of medieval philosophy?	Ok, so I'm trying to get up to speed on philosophy up to the modern day. Here are two facts:       1. I am an atheist (treat this as my religion).    2. I will never believe in Christianity, ever. You may not like this, that's fine. But I'm just stating this as a fact, I know this as certainly as you know that you won't believe in Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.       Given that, why should I follow the traditional philosophical curriculum and go from classical greece to medieval to rationalists/empiricists? The impression I have is that medieval philosophy is completely unconnected to what follows it.

20090226184510AAd4US5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is The Host better than Twilight?	Okay, well I hate Twilight, but I have friends who do. Those friends keep on trying to convince me to read The Host (also by Stephenie Meyer). They are saying it's either as good as Twilight or better than Twilight.      To help you, I'll tell you why I hated Twilight:       Edward was abusive    Bella was a Mary Sue    Edward was a Gary Stu   Plot cliches    Lack of plot   Characters were boring    Too much focus on looks   Words were used incorrectly   Thesaurus was overused   Writing was juvenile.       Basically I hated it for the reasons most antis hate it. Now for my question:      Is The Host better, worse, or the same as Twilight?
20090225120604AAUvdZG	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	Are there any things I should know about painting with acyrlics?	I recently did a painting in art class using acrylic paints.    I really enjoyed it so i bought some paint brushes, canvases, and acrylic paints. The brushes I got are really soft and I think they're nylon. Are those ohkay to use? And I realize now that blending green acrylic paint is difficult...as I found out last night when I started my painting. The blend is kind of choppy and i want to make it more subtle. How can I do that? And do I need a palette? Or can I just use paper plates and throw them away when i'm done? I dont waste any paint because I put a very small amount on the plate. I read that I can have a spray bottle close by to keep the paint wet, since acrylics dry out fast. But is there anything else I should know?       And I need some ideas for my painting, so lend me your suggestions, please! (The backround is light green to dark green diagnolly) if that helps for your ideas.         Thanks, bye.

Sweet, Sweet Spirit       The spirit descends on me slowly   As I close my eyes to pray.   His voice sweetly tells me don't worry   For today will be a better day.       Yesterday was so shaky   And tomorrow may be bad   But don't worry about today, dear   Please don't be so sad.       The spirit descends on my heart   Then into my soul it goes.   Feeling the renewing of my self   I must remember to be bold.       Warmth of the spirit I feel   Working close to my heart   I feel the comfort of staying   Never to depart.       Helping me with my feelings   Oh Lord I do thank you   For making this day a blessing   One that feels so true.       Remembering that when I need you   All I have to do   Is call on the sweet, sweet Spirit   And God will be next to me too.

So I have to wear a leotard underneath this flimsy dress for my winter guard and so far the big question has been whether or not to wear underwear and what kind. Some girls were planning on wearing thongs, which I can do, but I was wondering if it would be better to not wear underwear at all and would that make it easier to dance? Or would wearing a thong be just the same? I've never done this dance type of stuff before, so any experienced answers would help majorly.
20090225121209AADwX1h	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please comment on my work?	this is from my fanfic of Inkheart it does have some lines from the actual book from it but that is just so i can tell where it goes      i'm in love with Dustfinger and the book Inkheart so i created a character named Sapphire (to go with the whole weird name thing) plus i love the name      anyway i wrote some parts from the very first part of the book and i want to know what people think      i write a lot but i dont know how well since i dont feel safe posting things i could potentially publish so tell me what you think      the page number that the scene is from is before the passage      Pg. 4: “He’s not a burglar,” replied Mo, but as he stepped back from the window his face was so grave that Meggie’s heart thudded faster than ever. “Is that the only figure you saw?” Meggie nodded. Meggie could see Mo’s eyes darting to window but he steadied them. “Go back to bed, Meggie,” he said. “This visitor has come to see me.”      Pg. 5: “A very long time,” he said looking past his visitor as if he expected to see another figure emerge from the night. “And where is Sapphire does she not cling to you as if you were a magnet anymore?” Dustfinger suppressed a smile. “She’s here somewhere, you know she loves the rain.” Within the next minute a girl of about seventeen had stepped up next to Dustfinger. She was drenched from head to toe with water, and like Dustfinger she was wearing a long coat. Her black hair clung to her face and made her look like a ragdoll. She stared unblinkingly at Mo, and an uneasy silence set upon them. Meggie couldn’t tell what emotion the girl was feeling but for some reason it made her feel even more uneasy. Meggie stood quietly in the hall until Mo finally broke the silence. “Come in, you’ll catch your death. Meggie says you’ve been standing out there for sometime.”      Pg. 7: The girl who had come with Dustfinger emerged from the shadows. Meggie remembered Mo calling her Sapphire. She gazed quizzically at Meggie who felt awkward from the stare. The dull light seemed to accentuate the girl’s paleness. “Didn’t your father tell you not to listen,” whispered Sapphire. Meggie pretended not to hear, she didn’t however seem offended about being ignored. She turned and leaned on the wall next to Mo’s workshop, with her eyes closed.      Pg. 10: Meggie couldn’t help but notice that every time Dustfinger spoke Sapphire’s lips curled into a smile.      Pg. 10: Meggie heard a chair being pushed back and turned to scurry back to her room as she went she heard Sapphire call, in a voice that she was positive only she could hear, “Your feet will betray you!” Meggie didn’t understand what Sapphire had said but she didn’t have time to question what she meant for at that moment the door to the workshop opened. She was just able to close her bedroom door as Mo led Dustfinger out into the hallway.      thank you and please dont be too cruel

The Spectrum's Song      To drift onto the snowdrop banks,   Invisible of sight to where she sleeps.   The whispered song to grant her thanks,   A rose covered trunk is where she weeps.      The carpeted ground of bladed grass,   Beneath children's toes of powder skin.   The trickling laugh of young to pass,   On forest's earth to dance and spin.      Beneath the arch of coloured light,   Like a risen brow of merfolk's gaze.   The husky song from changing height,   Of breath spilt frost will grant it's haze.      The child voice that cooled her flight,   Did picture skin of a broken frame.   O spirit son and daughter sprite-   From spectrum song you have no name.            The "she" i talk of at the beginning is a rainbow. i am 13, apparently this one is not very good, and i am getting twitchy.   so be honest and tell me if you like it or not :)      songs that inspired me...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMcQKP3xI...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorHcOjZr...

My daddy gave me the job of scanning all our family photographs and saving them on a back-up drive. There are about 2,000 photographs. We are in a debate as to what type of folder system to use.      I say: Date / Subject / (numerical sequence).      He says:  Subject / Date / (numerical sequence).      I think dating the folders makes for a good historical time-line to follow.   He thinks subjects first because the same subject photographed at different times and grouped together is quicker for referencing.      Thoughts?

With a wistful smile   She deftly tucks the blanket in,   Whispering as she does so,   "There, sweetheart, there."   Litter chatters along the road,   Needing to be somewhere else.   The baby sleeps for now,   Oblivious to the street wind   And her mother's quiet struggle.   Stalking the sales, special offers,   Trying to find ends to make meet   Maybe get ahead of the game   Not just make it to payday.   Around her the City pulsates,   A steel, stone and wire leviathan   Devoid of emotion, warmth, heart.   It breathes, dead exhalations of fumes,   Smoke and remains of nightclub dreams.   She pulls her collar tight   Shoulders her bag and heads for home.   Car horns blare and engines hum.   Maybe tomorrow,   Maybe....
20090225120634AA1zRuM	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why am i classified by some as a Nihilist?	In a philosophical sense,i believe God is Nothing that is Something we don't understand. Because to me Nothing is like the womb that is empty,like space before creation so to create the universe.It is not possessive,it is invisible all powerful,non controlling giving us free choice,free will.We cannot describe spirit as an object or a form so is like an empty room, like something we do not comprehend because if it was full,there would be no room for anything new to exist or be created in that space.So by believing this way i take no thing away from the freedom to believe in God,regardless of the religion or spiritual believers.Also i believe i am a Christian as i take nothing away from the truth or what Christ says. I take nothing away from my belief in the Holy spirit.

20090226183530AAPo1it	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	HOW DOES THIS PART OF MY STORY SOUND SO FAR?	He laughed and looked away from me for half a second. When he looked back into my eyes, my heart started skipping beats. Looking into his eyes, I knew there was nothing innocent in his thoughts right now.       A mischievous smile spread across his face as he leaned towards me and pressed his soft lips on mines. He pushed my shoulder against the bed so I would lie down and he would be on top of me.       My heart was pounding so loudly that you could probably hear it from the living room. I was stiff and uncomfortable as his hands slid up and down my waist. His warm hands against my waist made me feel more than uncomfortable.       I was correct; I knew that those questions would have led to this. It felt good to be right   .    My mind was racing. I didn’t know if I should stop him from going any further than just kissing, or I should just take a chance and just let him do whatever he pleased? Of course he wanted to have sex. Which guy didn’t want that?      Probably I didn’t want to lose my virginity right now. May be I should wait until another, better time. I didn’t know what to do right now.      I felt his tongue start to play with my tongue. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do; I never French kissed a guy before, in fact I never even normally kissed a guy during my 17 years of life.       Was I supposed to shove my tongue down his throat or what? I didn’t do anything; I just had Omar led the way to everything.      I put my hands around his warm neck when I realized he pulled away from them. I wasn’t sure why he pulled away.       When I looked up, he was taking his oversized shirt off revealing his beautiful six packs. They were so defined. I could see them clearly even through the darkness. They looked like someone air brushed them on. They were as hard as they felt.    He threw his shirt on the floor and came back down to continue kissing me.       He rolled over so that I was on top of him now. His soft lips were so nice to kiss. He started kissing my neck now. It tickled when his lips touched my throat, but in a good way.       I hoped my Fantasy perfume didn’t ware out yet. I didn’t want to smell like sweat or anything. Not that I would smell like sweat with it 12 degrees out side.       Now I knew what I wanted; I decided to let loose and just lose my virginity with him right now.       Omar started playing with my blouse again, and pulled it up to my belly button

My (vague) topic was something along the lines of why germany wasnt interfered with earlier. Any criticism?                During the Holocaust, Germany was the only country that initially was a Nazi country. They did, however, convert other countries into Nazi countries. This was primarily done by force. This raises the question of why they were able to act in such a way when other countries clearly saw that Nazism was a bad idea. The majority of countries feared Hitler’s wrath so much, they were reluctant to resist him.  Alternatively, some countries decided that they supported his dictatorial efforts and sided with him. These countries created the Axis Powers. The major powers involved were Germany, Japan, and Italy. Opposing them in World War two were the Allied Powers. Countries affiliated with the Allies included The Soviet Union, the British Empire, and The United States of America. There were more than 40 affiliates.                 Considering how many more countries were involved in the Axis, it would seem that the Allies would win immediately. However, the war lasted from 1937 to 1941. The reason the Axis was able to stay in the war was partially the strength of their armies but also due to the number of countries annexed by the empires. Some of the countries, such as Austria, agreed peacefully to being occupied. Others exerted all of their efforts but ended up occupied anyway. Perhaps one of the most historical sequences of invasions by Germany was Czechoslovakia and Poland. Germany had made an agreement with the Allies that he would, after Czechoslovakia, not invade any other countries. He, however, broke the pact and proceeded to annex Poland. It was not until the pact was broken that the British and Americans got involved. But why did we wait?                 There are two major reasons Britain and America were hesitant to enter the war earlier. One was that they had both been deeply affected by the Great Depression. The other main reason was that they did not understand the extent of Hitler’s anti-semitic actions.  Also, neither country was interested in experiencing another world war and tried their best to stay out of the war. Another reason (which only applies to the United States) was that they found European affairs to be unimportant to the prosperity of the United States of America. Had there been interference earlier, the Holocaust would not have been as deadly as it was.                 Over the span of two months in 1945 (April and May) the European part of the war came to an end. Mussolini and Hitler died, German forces surrendered, and multiple peace treaties were signed. Minorities were removed from camps. The majority died sometime soon after this. Those that survived have, for decades, been involved in various forms of Holocaust education. The Holocaust and World Wars were both extremely deadly. Had Nazi Germany been challenged sooner, these events would have been far less deadly. But the course of events, although it resulted in many deaths of innocent people, resulted in the liberation of Germans and other Europeans. While there are still genocides, it is almost certain that Germany is permanently reformed.

I have layered quarter-length Brunette hair that is down to the middle of my back. It's kind of a bronze color, only darker and not shiny. I naturally have hazel eyes, but I wear contacts so I can change the color if I can just convince my mom to let me get colored ones. My face is oval-shaped.   I need a dress that you think may look good on me and isn't too expensive. If you could help me find one that would be great. Also, if you would be able to help me with make-up and jewelry that would look good on me and with the dress.      Please don't post if you are going to be rude or mean :)

20090226183634AAqJ0dO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	If this was in the back cover of a book?	If the following was on the back of a book cover, and you read it, would you be interested in reading the book?      On the planet Terra, one man has been consumed by sorrow. Sorrow has darkened his soul which is filled with an endless hatred for all things capable of sin. He shows that within the depths of his heart, there is still compassion by his efforts to assist a Princess of the Stars. In return, he is rewarded with unimaginable power. As he experiences romance and true friendship for the first time in his life, he feels happy. Yet, within him, a great tempest rages. His misanthropist desires for Terra (and the entire galaxy) overtake his desire to free himself from the shackles of past sorrow. His aspirations are brought forward and he begins to spread his them across the galaxy. The boundaries between light and darkness turn to shades of grey. A great Imperialistic Crusade to vanquish ‘the wicked’ has begun. As revelations of the future are revealed, he is told that soon nothing will be left but an endless future of death. Has a sequence of events already been set into motion that can’t be stopped? Will the Twilight of the Galaxy be near?

20090226185503AAsb2rc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good book idea?	here is the first 3/4 page.      Her pencil flew across the page. Loops and swirls. Zigs and zags. Lines and designs. Straight and curved.        Her drawing was a simple one. She was drawing her mind. Filled with confusion, anger, and happiness. She drew madly. Her hand moved viciously. Her pencil threatened to break any moment. She would not stop until she got the wonderful thought finished. The strokes got swifter and swifter. Her face was scowling and she was sweating.        The finished product was a mess. Lines everywhere, color bursting off the page. There was an occasional rip or dent in the shabby paper.        She studied the image, wrinkled her nose, and snorted in disgust. She was very particular with her creations. She had the highest standards in the whole new world. Her mind raced with other ideas. She quickly tossed the paper in the wastebasket. As she ran through her room silently, she tripped over her little sister’s toy. She picked up the animal and placed it on Mollie’s bed.        She ran to the small oak desk in the corner of the girls’ room. She shared it with her sisters, Edith and Mollie. Edith was seventeen and Mollie was only eight. She was fourteen, right smack in the middle. Her mother had just given birth to a boy, his name was Alex.        “Selina. It’s time for supper. Come.” Edith had said to her, emotionless. She had not even fully entered the room. Luckily for Selina, Edith was not in the room often. She was ready to be married, soon. Father had picked a nice tall man with dimples and a strong frame.        Selina was almost always cooped up in her room drawing or painting. Her parents did not approve of her being an artist. She had stolen pencils and paints from the small school house. She had also gotten pads of paper for her birthday.

20090226183118AA81B84	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	PLS READ, i want to be a writer can u pls tell me what you think of this scene?	describing a smell so sweet was merely impossible,   like a dish of unknown ingredients! it took me back    and sent me into a world of magic! i imagined being on a mountain, wind blowing   through my hair and all i could think of was what i was breathing   in! His scent! so sweet. Inhaling it until it pulsed through my    body and with my blood,awakened all my sleeping senses.    I came out of   my dream and realised i was still standing infront of him about to take    the plundge and kiss the lips that locked away that breath of sensual pleasure.   It was then just before i could examine the rest of this creature that he took hold of   me,i felt his hand gently tug the hair at the back of my neck and then a force    so powerful i had no control over it. This was not just the force of him   pulling me forwards locking me head to toe against his body.   It was my heart, it burned like it was engulfed in a shell of flames.   Fingers gripped tightly on my shirt and he relled me in with one last tug.   I felt the hairs surrounding my innocance and desire stand on end    and then a sound so orgasmic i nearly gave way completely. He had let out    another glimpse of what he might taste like and again his breath was mesmirizing.   It was then i moved in closer eager to have what awaited me. Moving his hand   from around my back he took my chin and gently pinched the tip. My head    naturally lifted up and it was then he leaned down into me. At first i felt his warm lips   purse against mine, then gently but with just the right amount of passion   he began to dominate me. Our rythme was in his control. My pulse began to   flutterer and with this i felt my legs shake and my back arch. His tongue gave    the edge of my lips a slight tickle and it was then i really tasted what i had craved.   This man could read my mind i didnt know how but he knew what a wanted.   When suddenly he let go, but why? I didnt come round straight away as i was still   stuck under his spell. My head was spinning and everything was a blur. Until i saw him!

We live in a fast mad society; we eat fast foods and drive fast cars and run around in our heads as busy bees to make more "honey". And where will this running take us? That's right, to a very neat grave furnished with a coffin with a lovely woodwork. All this mad running for ......nothing.      Please be fast in answering my question.          Thanks a lot.

20090226171702AAtcVHe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read what I written for chapter two so far?	by the way this is just my rough copy            I stared out the window of the car and watched the trees quickly pass by. Soon they ended and were replaced by a huge green field and a landing strip. I watched a big white plane take off and fly up in the sky. Its wings slicing through the air smoothly as it slowly made its way up to the clouds. The Brington airport was very large and as I starred at it I couldn’t help but wonder how the hell I was going to get from one side of the US to the other on my own. Thank god I would only be taking two planes.    I said my goodbyes to my mom and she worriedly asked once again if I was sure I could handle traveling on my own. This time I just picked up my bags and walked over to the conveyer belt.    There was a tiny Spanish girl standing there. She had a spiky bob cut and would’ve been very pretty if she didn’t have huge bags under her eyes. She could’ve been a vampire for all I knew. And she wasn’t very old either, no older than thirty.   She checked my tickets and took my luggage. I grabbed my yellow and orange carry on bag and passed through. Just before I went through the doors were I would be waiting for my plane, I turned around and waved good bye to my mom.    She blew me a kiss and waved back. I smiled at her and for a second all I wanted to do was run back yelling ‘mommy, I want to stay with you’. Instead I turned around and started walking towards the seats.   This was it, my first time traveling alone. The only other time I had traveled anywhere was that time mom and I went to Disneyland. But that was five years ago, and I wasn’t alone than. I hadn’t even been out of Brington since that.   Now I would be traveling alone to some small I town I’ve never heard of to live with a girl I’ve never met.    “Fantastic” I muttered under my breath. But it wasn’t like someone was forcing me to go. This was my decision; in fact it had been my idea. And who knows maybe it won’t be so bad. Maybe I’ll make some knew friends, or even find out something about myself. Although I was excited about meeting my grandma I was also very nervous. What would she think of me? Is she excited about meeting me too? What kind of person is she?   As I waited for the plane many more unanswerable question made there way in my mind, and all I could do is tell them to wait and be patient till we got to Sanderfeild

I'm planning to go to the library in a couple days, and I'd like to stock up on a lot of books, 'cause I'll be constantly reading them.   I'm 14, and some of my favourite books are; "The Catcher in the Rye", "The Shadow of the Wind", "The Giver", and "Till we have faces".   I enjoyed the Harry Potter series, but am looking for something a little more mature. I read the book, "Twilight" and am not so interested in it.      Some topics that I am interested in are, astrology and zodiac, vegan cooking and animal rights, lost languages, fiction (Mysteries, tragedies, love and myths), and world mysteries ex. Rasputin, 13 bloodlines, etc.
20090226183856AAwSWHV	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Where on the internet can I get free access to death certificates?	I'm not actually trying to search it to find out where she died, because I already know this (she died in a nursing home in Staten Island, NY).I'm looking to find her death certificate, so I could find out where she my great-grandmother Susan (or ''Assunta'') Mazzola was born. I believe it says where you're born on your death certificate. I know she was born in the U.S. to Italian immigrants, but unsure of where in the U.S. I know her exact birthday, which was April 2nd, 1908. She died on July 20th, 2007. She married a man named Joesph Mazzola. I'm unsure of her maiden name. I know she lived nearly her entire life in Boro Park, Brooklyn, New York. If any of could find out where she was born, I'd be greatful. I've tried asking people in my family, but her son, my grandfather, died when I was a baby. Her husband, my great-grandfather, also died when I was young. If you can't, if there's a link you could help find this for me, I'd appreciate it. I figured the one way I may be able to get it is by requesting a copy from City Hall in New York City. That probably cost some money though. The only thing I've looking to find out at this time is where she was born, and if possible, who her parents were. I know there's probably a lot of sites out there for this, but I know some are less reputable than other's, so that's why I'm asking.

20090226184753AARO40k	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	"Last Supper" by Cornell Barnes help!?	The "Last Supper" is Cornell Barnes' "retelling" of the famous work by Da Vinci. In the print Jesus is seated at the table surrounded by major contributing figures in African-American history (instead of the disciples).         I recognize most of them--Mary McLeod Bethune, MLKing, Malcom X, Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Frederick Douglas, and Harriet Tubman-- but I am a little stumped as to who the remaining figures are. I'm fairly certain the man standing (in the red robe) to the far right is Paul Robeson but I have no clue who the others are (the man in white to the right of M L K, the 2 men to the right of and behind Frederick Douglas, and the two men seated at the far right of the scene). Also, who is the person just on the left side of Jesus whose back is turned to us?      Please no facetious replies.  I see that this question has been asked before with only ridiculous responses.

20090226173402AAyejPv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like the beginning of the story my thirteen-year-old daughter wrote?	My brother is a genius.    Most people don’t believe me when I say that. They call me delusional, but I know better. And if you think I’m making it up, ask my mom or my dad.    The average person’s IQ is 100. If you have an IQ over 150, you’re automatically a genius. Matthew’s IQ is 184.    Matthew’s my little brother. He’s seven – three years younger than me, and we’re best friends. He’s memorized every Fibonacci number up to 12 586 269 025 and every prime number up to 3 125 672 873. He can do a hundred piece puzzle in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds. I know because when I was eight and he was five, I gave him my hundred piece Beauty and the Beast puzzle to look at and timed him as he put it together.    My brother is better at math than anyone I know, including my teacher. Sometimes I have him “help” me with my math homework, because he’s even better than a calculator. I’ve tried really hard equations with him like 256 x 397 and without a moment’s hesitation, he replied, “101 632.” And even with questions on my math sheet that had me stumped, like 789 2 (we were supposed to multiply it out, but why should I bother when I have Matthew, a.k.a. the human calculator, here to help me?), and he didn’t have to think for a moment before telling me the answer was 622 521.    I’m the only one who really understands my brother. He doesn’t speak – he’s never in his entire life said a single word, other than when he hums or answers mathematical equations. That drives my parents crazy – at first they thought he was doing it deliberately, but after awhile they accepted that something was seriously wrong and switched gears so fast it made my head spin. In its own way, that was even worse. My parents put Matthew into a million different therapies, mostly speech therapies. They convinced themselves that something was wrong with what they were doing, and set out to “fix” him and make him “normal”.    But not me. I accept my brother for who he is, and understand him better than anyone else does in the whole wide world.    One time when Matthew was six, he was filling out a multiple choice math sheet in class – easy questions like 4 + 5 and 7 – 3. There were forty of them, and he got every single one wrong.    There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that he’d done it on purpose. As his teacher put it, “If I actually believed that Matthew didn’t know the answers and merely guessed randomly, theoretically he would have still got between eight and twelve questions right. But he didn’t get any correct. Not a single one.”    No one understood why he’d done it. They drove themselves crazy trying to wrap their heads around it – was he rebelling against them? Had something gone wrong? Was this some kind of insane thing geniuses did?    It was somewhat amusing to watch them fumble around for an answer, actually. Only I understood, floating obliviously above the chaos, watching from up high. With my brother, sometimes there is no “logical” reasoning behind the things he does. Matthew tends to follow his heart rather than his head, and this was just another example. To him – and to me – it made perfect sense; he got all those questions wrong to prove he could. He was experimenting and testing boundaries in his own way, as all young children do. Matthew was so used to easily acing math tests that he wanted to see what would happen if, for once, he didn’t.    Another time, when Matthew was five and I was eight, we were at the lake. Our dad gave us permission to hike for a bit by ourselves as long as we didn’t get too close to the water and stayed together.    Matt and I went for a walk in the woodsy area, which wasn’t quite a forest but could have easily been mistaken for one. I didn’t let go of Matthew’s hand, even as I climbed up the gigantic jagged rocks with edges as sharp as broken glass and he scrambled up after me.    Then we came to the old abandoned pirate ship. It actually wasn’t a pirate ship, just an old canoe, but I had a very vivid imagination and made believe it was special and that it was a pirate ship. Matt always just went along with me.    I let go of my brother’s hand for just a minute. I jumped down from the rock at the boat, turning back to my brother and yelling to him to stay where he was. I didn’t know how safe this area was, and figured if one of us was going to get hurt, better it be me than Matthew.    I took one step on the curved boulder, then another, carefully balancing so as not to fall into the swirling, wild waters below. I took a third step and a fourth, and then – I lost my footing! I slipped and tumbled into the deep, icy waters.    Struggling to float and gasping for air, I screamed. Panicking, splashing around wildly, I prayed that someone would come save me before I drowned. Even though I knew how to swim, I wasn’t particularly adept, and especially not in raging waters as cold and deep as this one.    And in that one second after I screamed, Matthew jumped off his safe rock into the rough, uncertain waters. My

"The object of art is to give life a shape"    I am trying to find a way to represent this quote in a creative way   ex: drawing a picture, making a collage, sculpture etc.      I have about an hour and a half to do this so it doesn't/can't be too elaborate or too amazing.   Something to do with a simple object perhaps and the shape of it?   Any ideas would be awesome.   Thanks!

20090226172223AAaI0cL	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Macbeth Essay: Dignity as a weakness that leads to his downfall?	I am writing an essay, demonstrating that dignity is a weakness of Macbeth that eventually leads to his downfall. I have two points so far, one being he murders Duncan as to prove himself as brave to Lady Macbeth. The second being he decides to fight Macduff, knowing he'd die but only as to not be disgraced as an tyrant.   I need one more point, and I cannot think of one. The only one I could come up with but its not very valid is him pursuing his own interests, not being a very dignified King among his people. Also that maybe if he stayed loyal to King Duncan, nothing tragic would have happened.      Anyway, please any help would be great!   Thanks!

I WILL ADD PART OF THE FIRST CHAPTER LATER.  I JUST COPIED THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I WANTED NEW PEOPLE TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.       Preface   The pain seared into my skin. How could this pain be so important? I couldn’t understand. No, I am not emotional if that’s what you’re thinking. I screamed for someone to help me. Some of the girls turned away and covered their ears. The guys just looked solemn. Most of all, my own mother would not help me. I looked with fear with what life I had left. I slowly went into the cold darkness.      I fumbled to get the seatbelt or whatever you call it off. My mother was getting irritated with me stuck in my seat. " Yes!!" I said. "Finally." When we got to the airport, I went smack into the vending machine. "Eeep!!" I squeaked before I went down. "Ugh, what am I going to do with you, Victoria?" My mother inquired. I laughed. "It's your fault that you concieved me, mom." She picked me up with no effort. "Another trip to my personal office", my mother sighed while saying. " How did you slam into the machine anyway?" I was trying to get out of the airport before they closed." I said      "You and your fears, and it's only 3:00 in the afternoon!"   "But.. But.."   " Cmon." my mother said. " You stay close to me, you understand? I don't want you to to smack right into the window next." She chuckled. She thinks she's funny but she's not. She is kinda like me only she's more calmer, most of the time anyway.      I shook my head, trying to get the stars out. My name is Victoria and I am asian. My mother says that she ate too many thing with soy sause. At first, I didn't get it, but after many years, I got it. I was a VERY tan asian. Most people don't think I am from a family that is pale as white. They think I am from some Philipino family. Some stupid idiots have made fun of me for it and as the effect, I socked them in the face.      We walked out of the the airport without me gettiing more injuries. "Where is the house?" "Be quiet" my mother said with a stern voice. "Ok. TAXI!!!!" my mother screamed. It had seem that all the windows broke at the start my mother yelled. She has a VERY loud and high pitched voice. I have the same genes which did not help me during high school tryouts to be singing. One thing about my voice that is different with hers is that I can actually sing. But sometimes her genes take over and then I have to be sent home with a bill attached to my homework.

I'm 16 and honestly very competent.       But to get to the point. I never get chances like this, never. My parents aren't bad parents they're just hard asses. I had this same situation once before and skipped a day and know I won't get caught. I'm not looking at moral repurcussions here, I know I won't get caught. I know I can catch up on the work I'll miss as I've already a fairly advanced grip on all my current material.       But lately I've been pretty stressed. I haven't enjoyed anything as much as before and felt generally depressed. I'm not really home alone as my younger brother (15) is home too. I'd love a day to myself and skipping school is the only way to get some real alone time.      Is it worth it? And please, PLEASE, do NOT go on a moral rant about what's right and wrong, I know this will have nothing to bite me in the *** as far as school works, I'm intelligent enought to handle catching up one day...

I'm writing a story that's a adventure/modern-fantasy in which two of my characters will eventually be in a romantic relationship. I want the relationship to lead to the main male character to work with the main female and some supporting character to save the main females life.      I want my story to have fantasy elements in it but I want the relationship to seem realistic.      So my first question is how do I make the relationship seem believable? How fast or slow should it progress? what stages should the couple go through?   My second question is how do I make sure that the plot doesn't revolve around the relationship but rather, the plot makes the relationship possible.      Thanks.

20090226190153AAXEu7n	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	I need advice from another professional photographer...?	I recently shot a wedding. Everything went smoothly, I had no problems with the guests nor did I have to deal with a "Bride-zilla". I took well over 1500 photos for the bride and groom to choose from to be edited, which we met in person to closely and in detail go over the photos and let them choose which ones and how they were to BE edited. It was a GREAT learning experience being that it was my first wedding. I really have no complaints at all. Sunday, I met with the b&g to go over the photos and that went smoothly, except that the bride was on the phone half the night and the groom was sleep half the time, and I couldn't get a single picture decided on with editing notes made.  Oh well, I offered an online proofs page through ImageShack, although I dislike using other sites to post things like that, but with having that many photos, it was really my only choice since their cd Drive is broke on their computer.  Well I just finished loading the photos up which took about 10 hours if not more to the site and sent them the link, afterward, the mother of the bride (who paid for the photos) called to apologize for a bank problem and asked for the link to the proofs, so I told her I would do it, and thought on the spot for an extra bonus for the b&g, to have the mother pic some photos to be edited since they stated they only want a few edited with "the works". well 3 hours after that I got a raging, screaming man, claiming I ruined their entire wedding experience and that they were now contacting an attorney to file charges for giving out the photos (which when the mother paid by check, made a legal document for purchase, as well as the b&g breaking the contract for the part of the contract that says they're not allowed to discuss any form of payment or fee's with anyone, potential client or not on the basis that we stick within people's budgets based on visuals of appearance like clothing and the kind of car you drive) they also broke the contract for having the videographer there taking photos with a professional set up as well as a religious tolerance agreement that states I have the right to freedom of religion protected by the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution by calling me a "F***ING SACRILEGIOUS ATHEIST" as part of the harassment and threats I got in the phone conversation.      What do I do?      They DEMAND the disc of unedited photos be express first class mailed to their house within 2 days or else they're coming here to TAKE them. (as in breaking and entering and possible assault), and they are threatening a lawsuit for ruining a suprise to their family when there is nothing in the contract stating that I had to restrict who I show the photos to, in fact it states that I have full rights to distribute, publish, print or transfer in anyway, etc... and they're telling me I have to delete the photos and that they don't want me to use them for portfolio now.      There is nothing I did to break the contract what-so-ever. I reread it three times since that phone call and I'm curious to my options here as a photographer and copyright owner of the photos.      Do I:      A) Sue them immediately for breaking the contract in 4 or 5 ways.   B) Wait for them to sue me and then counter-sue for breaking the contract and harassing me.   C) Let it go and write it off to anger and then refuse to work with them or their family, and refer to  option "B" if necessary.
