But there are LEGAL implications to that, and governments are bound by the law. Just don't expect the masses to understand that point.

Obama is pushing as hard as any President since Reagan did, to bulldoze his policies through.<br>  The problem is that depth of the economic issues, and the need for clearly thought out plans doesnt work with quick policy. As each plan is quickly introduced and put into play, the reaction from the professionals is bad. This causes the market to fall.|`|73a9ec57af6e4fbdc505f6322bf41d34aa	And how do you know the economy is getting worst? Do you judge that by watching the Stock market go up and down like a  yo yo?

War creates a role model and a message to the younger generation that it's a harsh and evil world. They grow up knowing that the Fathers of this nation are ending lives for the sake of oil. This would not make someone feel like being nice. Criminal rates have shot up rapidly since the war began - and suicide rates. It's a form of unrest.<br>  <br>  2. The poverty spreading throughout this nation is also because of the war. Over 1 trillion has been spent on this war so far - we're now paying for it but we're not meant to realize that the money is badly needed nor that we're actually losing the war.|`|OxuKo9yWaa	Great link, noisy sirens= more crime.<br>  And there it was me thinking it was due to lack of parenting and self respect.<br>  silly me, of course the sirens!!|`|SYU4JIohaa	Well I was always a good citizen, then I heard a WOOOOooooo, WOOOooooo and I just had to run out there and commit a crime, god dammit!|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	Wooo woooo whoop whoop get the hell out of the way, this mp is late for lunch, wooo wooo BANG BANG whooo whoop whoop.|`|VYywucN8aa	I like the uk sirens.

zy8mKJxeaa	A two state solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security is the answer.<br>  All factions on the Palestinian side must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized borders and renounce terrorism.<br>  The borders should be roughly along the 1967 lines with mutually agreed upon minor adjustments. For example, the Jewish Quarter of the old city should be part of Israel and a tunnel or causeway should connect the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza.<br>  Refugees, both Jewish and Palestinian Arab should be compensated. Being roughly the same number, it would be impractical and dangerous to move populations to other areas so monetary settlement should be aimed at.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Hamas have to stop the attacks on Israel and release the Israeli soldier they are holding captive. However in return Israel must open all the borders, release many of the 11,000 prisoners they are holding and agree to a 2 state solution although this may mean removing all illegal settlers from the West Bank All this will not be easy but this is the ONLY way peace will return to the people of Israel and Palestine|`|XHmz4R99aa	This thing is never going away as long as there is humans on earth. If you believe in the bible, God cursed us for eternity to war and kill each other for our attempt to be like Him/reach his status.<br>  <br>  The war has roots all the way back to the Christian holy war and even before, The Crusades. The fight to control Jerusalem. Christian-America with its nuclear might gave Israel control of Jerusalem. That's why America and Israel will always be bed buddies. And the Muslims will always try to take it back. Of course when they do, the Christians and/or the Jews will do exactly the same.<br>  <br>  A really cookie idea would be to nuke the place, so nothing can survive in that particular piece of land for 1000 years. 'cept for the ants and cockroaches. Of course after that 1000 years, all the killing will start all over again.<br>  <br>  Another less violent idea is to let no one own that land, and let different people from different places, religions, ethnic background or whatever time share.

0NcRUSCoaa	How weird.  The question is, where were the parents? I think I would have called the police the minute I had this lady's details.|`|f6qmRicQaa	That is so incredible it has to be true.  Wow, what a way to boost the little ones self esteem.  I don't know what to say other than this; if someone offered to sell me their children I would probably buy them, then of course immediately contact the police, just because if they were willing to do it once they would likely do it again and who knows who the next buyer would be.  My biggest question is where are the parents?|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Dang.  I mean, I like parrots too, but... Sometimes it's a tossup which one is louder or makes the bigger mess.  If those people thought they would be better at handling a large bird than human children, they're probably even dumber than you'd think!|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	i would have to wonder if those kids weren't better off with the people who bought them.it's a sick, sick world we live in when something like this can happen|`|zlmnfFpYaa	Depends on the kids.  I've some little delinquents I'd trade for a couple of Slim Jims and a 20 ounce Bud Light.|`|y3b1X671aa	You have to consider what kind of backwater place in which this happened.|`|GOifC7i3aa	weird indeed<br>  <br>  so she was looking after children that were not her own, traded them for a bird....?<br>  <br>  how lucky was she that the bird's owners were open to this deal....most people would have notified the police<br>  <br>  and who were the parents of these kids?<br>  weird indeed
aROi7KG5aa	Oh my goodness you are right ! I never thought about it till you said Olsen twin but she does.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	i'm not sure who she is trying to look like but she definitely had plastic surgery. they had pics on tv of her before and she has had a nose job and something done with her lips. maybe she should have saved the money from the botched lip job and got some lypo|`|q9BItD25aa	Not in the least.To me she does not look like the Olson twins.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Her lips look like she was bit by bees.<br>  The media continue to exploit the story that really I am so sick of her, all I do is flip channels when they have a story on her.
1G3XPiq3aa	So that when we're being held at gun point, we can look through our bag, or under the seat of our car, locate the gun, pull it out, shoot the would be offender and save ourselves, our family, and the ideals of our nation...<br>  <br>  Hrmm... I thought I'd get more thumbs up from idiots not picking up on sarcasm. Oh well =(|`|AA10283080	In reality if I were being held at gunpoint I wouldn't have time to look under my car seat or through my handbag in order to get my gun before I got shot.<br>  <br>  Owning a gun will not stop violence. It will either attract it or cause it.<br>  <br>  There are some people who own guns and use them how they are supposed to be used by hunting game to feed their families or for actual protection but the problem is that they are grossly outnumbered by people who own them to boost their own ego.<br>  <br>  Nobody is trying to outlaw guns just like nobody is trying to outlaw cars. But there are restrictions that need put into place just like there need to be restrictions on driving cars.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	When you look at the murder rates in the USA, Canada, UK, France, Australia you see that they are highest in the USA by far. The numbers are even more extreme when you only consider guns. Why?<br>  It is clearly because of the vast number guns in the USA. If your rights to hand gun ownership are more important than the lives of thousands of  Americans each year then just carry on as you are.<br>  Americans make war on themselves. If anyone else killed 10,000 Americans  you you would do anything to stop further killing.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	there was a case on a college campus where 2 people took down a shooter after retrieving a gun from their car. i want to say Louisiana but i'm not sure.could have helped at virginia tech that's for sure.i carry a gun personally, i started after some pervert was seen looking in my child's window. he later tried to follow us to her school and stopped me and tried to get me out of the vehicle by saying there was no plate on the vehicle..so do we have a need? i sure do...and so do others..the guns that are used in killings are usually illegal, note i say usually so it wouldn't stop them from getting their guns. why shouldn't i,as a law abiding citizen be able to defend myself|`|AA10065759	Well, I remembered back in the early 1990s some town in<br>  Missouri(I believed) passed a law making it illegal for<br>  anyone in that town to own a handgun.<br>  <br>  Sometime after that another town passed a law saying that<br>  everyone in their town should own a handgun and that town<br>  passed a "have a gun law", this town was getting their name<br>  in the news to go against this "anti-handgun" law passed <br>  in that other town.<br>  <br>  After a couple of years later......<br>  <br>  The town that has the "anti-handgun law".....Crime rate<br>  went UP a bit.<br>  The town that had the everyone should own a gun law<br>  the crime rate WENT DOWN quite a bit.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	Same reason we still need a right to vote even with the Chosen One in office. Rights are eternal and inalienable. Never willingly abandon any right.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	First off...because it is one of our rights. The 2nd Amendment.<br>  England and Australia's crime rate have jumped significantly since they have given up their rights to own a hand gun and they warn Americans to NEVER give up their gun rights.<br>  <br>  It makes no sense to me to think that if the law-abiding citizens don't own guns that crime will go down. Many civilians lives have been save because they were armed. They just don't make the news.<br>  <br>  It would make the lives of criminals much easier if civilians weren't armed.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	Go to youtube. Look up "England Gun Ban Update."<br>  They said that in london nearly EVERY house has had at least one attempted break in. The police feel inadequate because they cannot protect the people. One man shot and killed a boy of 16 with TWENTY NINE previous convictions. That man had been broken into twice before. He went to jail for life for murder. Wow it would have been so much better if those two had overpowered him and killed him. Then that helpless young man would still be alive. Watch the video. Several times the brits send us the message. Never give up your right to your guns.|`|9NcOBG8Laa	Because although 1.5 hundred kids are killed every year by negligent firearm owners, 1.5 million crimes are intervened every year by non-military, non-police, civilians.|`|wQwufvKNaa	YES THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THOSE GUNS ARE BEING SMUGGLED INTO MEXICO, AND THEY ARE USING THOSE GUNS TO KILL THE MEXICAN POLICE.<br>  <br>  MEXICO GETS ALL OF ITS GUNS FROM THE USA, WHILE THE USA GETS MOST OF ITS DRUGS FROM MEXICO. <br>  <br>  WHAT A TRADE|`|oDhSxINLaa	If we outlaw guns, the outlaws will still get guns, but law abiding citizens will be unprotected.
