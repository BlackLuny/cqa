20090219225856AAFcohi	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Promotion / merit raise dispute.?	The company I work for (which starts at $7.50 when i started) does merit raises every Feb-March, they conveniently missed last year all together I heard and I do not want that to happen to me this year. Typically, people say their merit raises are from $0.15 - $0.40 or 0.50 (high).      I joined the company last January (08) and rule was that you have to be in the company for at-least 3 months in-order for the merit increases to apply. Okay... so I waited and grinded my teeth because people who joined a month before me were eligible, and i'd have to wait 13-14 months for the next time around.      In the beginning of summer around June I got a $0.25 raise because the State minimum wage went up that amount bringing me to $7.75.       In August or September of '08 I accepted a promotion and got bumped up to $9.00.      Now it's February of '09 and am being offered another promotion which would be in affect March sometime at the latest, and when I inquired, my boss said I'd get bumped up to $10.00 and something, but WON'T receive merit increases.       Than my boss said "is that alright?" Should I demand a merit increase? What goes through my mind is that the $0.25 raise was mandatory and should not looked at. My promotion to $9.00 was because I was doing more / harder things. Now this NEW promotion expecting me to be at >$10.00 is because I will be doing more work than before. ..... And merit increases are based on performance, right? Just because I'm doing more work and being compensated for it doesn't mean that my performance was lacking or to be neglected?? I got almost all the employee of the months last year. I should be getting 2 raises right? Merit for my great performance and 1 for a promotion doing more work and being responsible for more. It just so happens it will land in the same month, right?...

20090219234540AAZK0Tx	Business & Finance;Advertising & Marketing;Other - Advertising & Marketing	Which telemarketing job should I pick?	k. i got hired at 2 jobs today. keep in mind they're both shitty telemarketing gigs. im trying to pick which one is less shitty. the first one is outbound calls, selling golf clubs. it's from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., and it pays $8 an hour OR 8% commission, whichever is higher, and I'd be looking at $500-$700 a week I think. At that job the turnover rate is pretty high, if you aren't good enough they fire you. The second one is screening inbound calls for auto warranty salesmen, that way the sales people arent worrying about do not call lists and whatnot, theyre only getting hot leads. it's from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and pays $10 an hour plus $5 for every deal you refer to a salesman that closes, and I'm probably looking at $450-$550 a week. I don't know what the turnover rate is, but I'm assuming it's a lot lower since you don't have to worry about making sales.   Which would you pick?

20081027140837AAyDgM4	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How does taxation destroy jobs?	The following passage is from the book, Economics In One Lesson.  I do not understand how taxation destroys jobs.  Is it because the money that is taxed would have otherwise gone towards the purchase of things other than govt projects?      "I do not intend to enter here into all the pros and cons of public housing. I am concerned only to point out the error in two of the arguments most frequently put forward in favor of public housing. One is the argument that it “creates employment”; the other that it creates wealth which would not otherwise have been produced. Both of these arguments are false, because they overlook what is lost through taxation. Taxation for public housing destroys as many jobs in other lines as it creates in housing. It also results in unbuilt private homes, in unmade washing machines and refrigerators, and in lack of innumerable other commodities and services."      Thanks in advance!

I'm trying to be savvy in my job search, but I'm running into practices that I'm not sure are legitimate, and I'd like input.      Last night I emailed over twenty resumes and cover letters to job openings I saw on Craigslist.com- most of them for administrative assistant positions.  Some of these companies didn't share their name, which is fairly common in job ads.  Today I received a reply from one of the anonymous companies.  It's called Tallak Sprint Media and I'm pasting the reply below.  After you read it, please tell me what you think.   1.  Is there any way this company is legitimate?   2.  Is this a legitimate way to ask for a background check?  Is that background check company legitimate?      I Googled this company, and there was only one hit for their name.   http://www.tallaksprint.com/   It claims the site is down for server maintenance.  Sounds awfully convenient and shady to me.

20090220011025AAfpiya	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Thinking about buying a fixer upper  it's bank owned.?	my fiance and i found a house that is really cute. someone had bought it and started working on it but was not able to finish but it's a three bed 1 1/2 bath which is what we need. it's nice looking on the outside and very open on the inside(they took down some walls). We wouldnt really change very much. the only problem is were not sure it would pass an inspection and it's bank owned. We didnt see any problems that would let us know right away it wouldnot pass but they want 118,000 for it. it's clearly not worth that much.anyone had any experience with buying bank owned homes? did they go down in their price or were stubborn? our agent said it's not worth 118 either.

20090220023018AAozpWB	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Try to increase house value or leave it alone?	We need to bump the price up!  We may be selling our house in about a year for work reasons (relocation).  The problem is we bought the house 9 months ago just 5,000 below the VA's appraisal value and $25,000 below what they were asking.  It's only 5 years old so I can't do much to improve it but the walk out basement was half finished when we bought it so my husband and I were thinking about installing a full bathroom down there ourselves.  It already has the rough in so we estimated it to be under 7,000 to do the job ourselves.   I'm a very frugal shopper!      -stuff we already did-  do you think it will help much?      When we bought the house it came with no appliances so we bought matching stainless steel Frigidaire for the kitchen and LG front load washer and dryer for the laundry room which would stay in hopes it helps get some value back considering we got all the appliances for about a steal at only $4,000 for all of them.  No, I didn't skimp out!  The fridge has an ice maker along with filter water dispenser and all that junk.  They are great appliances.          I have already painted the interior of the house neutral colors due to the fact that the previous owner still had the contractor paint up in some rooms and very bold colors in other rooms.        We replaced all the contractor lighting in the main living area of the house including the dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and halls plus they all match.         We live in a little town in the mideast that hasn't seen the price reductions that the rest of the world is seeing.  They have just about stayed the same.  Actually when we bought the house there was 103 homes on the market and now there are only 44 if that helps.        Also if you don't think the bathroom addition would be good what about extending the patio outback.  As of now you can just fit a table with 6 chairs on it.  We talked about extending it and considering we know someone who would be more then happy to help us and owns a cement business it would be at cost. He already volunteered himself.  We back up to woods and I know I wanted it done so I was thinking maybe it would be a good idea.        One more thing I almost forgot.  Right now the house is considered a 4 bedroom.  There is another room but does not have closet doors but it has a recessed area a closet could go.  We were thinking about putting the wall and closet doors up to be able to count it as a bedroom but weren't sure if it would still count as a bedroom due to the fact that the window is not the same size as the windows in the other bedrooms.       Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully help us figure this out.  Oh, and no matter what we do we won't price the home out of the neighborhood.  My dad tough me well.  You buy the cheapest house in the best neighborhood!  lol

She's really sweet and adorable, likes me alot, and very low matiance. Kally was sick a week earlier, but her parents said she was doing better, but she wasn't. She threw up twice, once on the carpet which I cleaned, and once in the toilet. I texted her dad to let him know because he said to text him if something happened. I took her to bed at nine and slept right by her until her dad came home. (Poor thing :( ) Her dad gave me 25$ at the end of the night, for babysitting for three hours, and I've been wondering if that's too much? I'm new at babysitting for money since I used to babysit my cousin for free, I don't know if what they're paying me is too much, and if it is I don't want them to keep doing it because it just doesn't feel right. Kally is a pleasure to babysit and I'd do it for free just to help them out, but I really do need to save up money for my future. So, am I getting overpaid, if so what should I do?

Does anyone know where I can get more information on this, and whether this is in affect now? I am out of work and looking for help on my mortgage repayments. Any other help anyone can give would be appreciated!         Brown unveils mortgage interest deferral scheme      LONDON (Reuters) - The government will guarantee a scheme to allow households suffering a temporary loss of income due to the downturn to defer interest payments for up to two years, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday.      He said Britain's eight largest banks have agreed to take part in the scheme, designed to prevent a surge of repossessions as the economy weakens.      "This measure will extend protection for those in work as well as those out of work and be available at a higher level of income," he told parliament.      "We will make this possible by guaranteeing lenders against the risk of loss from those deferred interest payments," he said.      Brown also said a voluntary code of conduct for banks would be made statutory. News reports have said this could allow banks to be fined if they did not treat customers fairly.
