And whenever I place disks in it won't read that there is one in. It acts the same as when you take a disk out and shut, it just looks for a disk then decides "nup there ain't one in there!!"

I have tried inserting the disk then going through My Computer and right clicking D Drive and choosing Install or Run Program' on the drop down menu but it comes up with an alert saying : 'D:/ Application not found.'

I just installed XP Home edition on this computer yesterday.I believe It has an onboard video chipset because there's no video card inside, just the connection on the board.It booted up to the desktop in 4bit color quality.It wouldn't let me change it to another resolution or quality.Then, When it detected new hardware, which it said was VGA Video controller.After it looked on the internet to find the updates for it, it said it could not complete because access is denied.which i didn't understand.I went to Microsoft  update and to dell to download the driver from their sites and manually install that way.It prompted me to restart the computer, and while it was booting on the Windows XP screen, it showed me the blue screen with error code 0x0000007f.I purchased the computer off eBay.There's a sticker on the front of the computer case that says its a P4 GX240, but the area around the power button says its a Dimension 2300.very confusing.if somebody could hemp me id really appreciate it.

The things i find curious:       Sometimes when i have the disk pluged in Windows from the other HD wont boot. When its not plugged in it always boots up.      I think its the SATA cable... but im not sure... i wasnt able to check it on another PC yet.      Have to say that PC workd ok with both HDD's for a long time.

20090225093918AAqghOs	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why does my  computer take so long to boot?	Ok so basically I built a new pc. Fresh installed xp pro. Haven't installed much else. Went into msconfig and got rid of everything, but it still takes a while. I don't get why. I just put a fresh install of xp onto my friends sucky emachines and his takes like 10 seconds to boot. Mine takes at least 50 seconds. People who have similar systems have said theirs takes just seconds to load.       Specs: Intel Q9550 @ 2.83ghz, ASUS Rampage Extreme, OCZ Fat4l1ty 1066 DDR3 4GB, 630W Rosewill PSU, 1TB WD sata hard drive, LG DVD drive. The only thing that sucks is my video card. It's a geforce PCI 128mb video card that I am using just for now until I decide on a new one.      But really loading an OS is not GPU intensive and I just don't get why my system takes so long!! It should take less than 10 seconds for sure. Also, when the xp boot screen is up, it freezes up a little ways in (the bar stops in place) but then it keeps going      Are there memory options that I should set or something? My friend's computer has worse specs than mine and it loads in ~10 seconds, but he's using vista.      Please don't just say 'you're impatient' that's not what I'm asking and my patience is not relavent to the issue.

Whenever I filter the data by day of the week and enter equations in the empty cells immediately to the right of the data and then save it,; I will open it again, and the solutions to my equations will still be there, but there is no equation. This is very frustrating because I need to go through and make sure there are no erros (such as might be caused when the NYSE is closed on a Wednesday, thus changing the formula needed to find Thursday's APY).

The monitor is recognizing its plugged into the computer (The "not plugged in" box isn't floating across the screen, that is to say) but there is no display.  Cracked the case back open to make sure I didn't dislodge anything while I was taking the wireless card out, and everything was snug and secure.        Any ideas? Need more info?

On my hard drive, I have a directory full of hex files which is located in E:\infile . I also have a directory with subdirectories named after gallery name values (B1:B86). These directories are located under E:\directories.      What I would like to do is to write a macro that reads the values from both sheets and move all the hex files from infile directory to the their corresponding subdirectories under the directories folder.      The macro needs to find the hex value from sheet1, and then find the galleryID value associated with this hex number. Then find the gallery name associated with this galleryID and finally move the file into the corresponding directory (named after that gallery name) inside E:\directories      Can someone please help me with this?

20090225101059AAUgnmV	Computers & Internet;Software	Know any good software to put home movies on DVD.?	I don't something to help me win an academy award here, just something simple to give me some decent graphics, effects, etc, and is somewhat inexpensive. My local Costco has Roxio 2009 Sp Ed for $79 including the VHS-DVD converter. Seems like a decent deal, but I've seen split reviews on this one. Either it works great, or not at all.       So I just want your thoughts on what you've used, what works for you, etc. I'm still using XP if that helps. Thanks.

20090225094115AAIDu6m	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Looking for online object / product design & manufacture...?	Over the years I've visited a few sites which create one-off products, in a variety of materials and based on designs which individuals can upload.  These can range from cardboard iPod holders and Plexiglas lampshades up to aluminum guitar bodies (the last one I read about in Wired a while back).      Never having needed to actually use these sites, it seems I never bookmarked them.  Now, I'd like to make a pendant and am unable to find anything.      Any ideas about sites that do this kind of thing?      Cheers...

20090225095712AAudNWz	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Only a few computers will work on my wired network?	So here's how it's set up... Cable modem to dlink firewall/router. From there to a netgear 16 port switch from there to different computers on my network and to a wireless access point. I have a static ip that I programmed into the dlink and when I put in the dns server addresses into the computers on the network it only work on about 3 of 6 computers on the network. Also the wireless access point is not allowing internet through there. Limited or no connectivity on everything that doesn't work. I can see that it is sending data but not getting anything back. When I go into the options on a computer not working I can see that the ip address is blank. it is set to obtain ip address automatically. They are set exactly the same as ones that work. Please help this is a nightmare!

I bought extra components like an nVidia 8600 GE Force graphics card and about 2GB of RAM. I play WoW on the computer and before i installed Wrath of the Lich King i had 34 fps in Major cities and raids and 64+ fps everywhere else with the best graphic settings. Now my fps is only 12 in major cities with my settings about midway and its 5fps in raids! Can someone please help me? Or do you think i should take it in to a computer repair shop for a tune up?

20090225101040AApnZgP	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I edit videos on the computer?	I am about to get a new digital video camera and I would like to know about how to edit videos on my computer. It will be a small 170$ camera that uses an SD card. The reason I ask is because I would like to post some videos on youtube and Tangle, but I want it to be put together nicely. I have seen some videos that have certain clips in it that are cut and blended in with other different clips or that suddenly go blank to show some texts written on the screen. (Not cartoons, but real video)       In the answer, could you please include.... This will earn a best answer....   -Any software that will be needed and how much it is   -How to edit   -How to insert music into the video   -Any sites I can go to to purchase the software
