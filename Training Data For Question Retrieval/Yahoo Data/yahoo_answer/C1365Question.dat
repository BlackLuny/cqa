20090223113738AA6bGlc	Social Science;Sociology	Did  country  boys  ever  roll  up  their  pant  legs  ?	When John Greenleaf Whittier wrote his poem “The Barefoot Boy”, he visualized a barefoot boy with his pant legs rolled up ( “With thy turned up pantaloons” ) . Norman Rockwell painted several paintings of barefoot country boys with their pant legs rolled up . John Greenleaf Whittier was born in 1807, he wrote “The Barefoot Boy” in 1855, and Norman Rockwell’s career ran from 1915 to 1961, so they were depicting a much different time period . NOW -- my questions are “Did country boys ever roll up their pant legs ?” and “Why did country boys roll up their pant legs ?” . Thank you in advance for your answers .

I was shivering and hearing things and seeing things, hysterical i think is what my mom said. And when i fell asleep, i was crying in my sleep, almost screaming my parents said. They moved me into their room that night cause I was hearing people outside, planning to steal our food (kinda like something in the book) and I was seeing dead bodies everywhere cause most everyone died in the book.

20090223115754AAjyQ3V	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	I need a feminist's opinion?	To start off, I believe that women have just as many rights as men, and that they deserve to be paid the same at their place of work. So do not construe my question to appear sexist. Question:      To what degree do feminists believe there is equality of the sexes? Obviously, there is an inherent difference biologically; men have penises and women have vaginas. But what about non-biological differences? I often hear the slogan "girl power" and "girls can do anything boys can do." I do agree that woman have slipped into what were once male dominated professions such as the armed forces and aviation, but do you really think you can do everything?      Who here honestly believes women could compete with men in the NBA, NHL, NFL? I would go so far as to say a top ranked men's high school basketball team could win the Olympics in Women's Basketball, and that a top ranked mens college soccer team, like Stanford for instance, could defeat the US Women's World Cup Team.      What I'm trying to get at I guess, is that both sexes excel in different ways. We both have strengths and weaknesses, and we can both contribute to society in different ways. I suppose I'm just sick and tired of hearing the BS that girls can legitimately compete with boys in sporting events, with very few sporadic exceptions (like 90 llb weight class in high school wresting - LOL).

I think all people are equal no matter what they look like, but society gives the beautiful people an advantage. Should women who are upset by this simply go with the flow and make themselves as hot as possible?      Looking good can be a great weapon. Why not use it as much as you can?   1) Whatever you want to do in life as a woman looking better makes it possible. It opens doors. Look at Sarah Palin. Being pretty doesn't make you more or less qualified to govern, but it will make people more receptive. Same goes for every job.      2) Modern technology can turn almost any woman into a stunner. You want to let an eye lift be the only thing keeping you back from where you want to be?

I still look behind my back when walking down the hall and quickly turn off my light and jump in bed! Haha. I know. Well I got really freaked out by this dream and want to know if it has a meaning. I dreamt that my mom and i went to some relatives house and we were staying the attic, and I told her i needed to wash my face so I went up the stairs of the attic and the lighting was dim, there was a bathroom with a mirror above the sink ( in the attic) and I began to wash my face. as soon as I lifted my head to dry off, she was standing behind me. I know I didnt scream or anything but I turned around to look at her. Just then, my point of view changed, first it was me looking at her, i couldnt see myself, then after i turned around it was like i was watching my dream, i could see me and her looking at each other. As soon as I saw the different view the girl turned and looked at ME. me as in she knew I was watching my own dream. It makes my eyes water its so creepy. Tell me what you think!

For about 4 months i have had this dream on and off, 5 nights in a row once.      I am 15      Anyway.      It is the number 7787 in red letters on a stark white background, the 8 in the number is raised slightly above the 7's and there are chimes and darker bells very non-harmoniously in the background.      Eventually a spider appears out of the top right corner crawling backwards carefully avoiding all of the numbers.      At first this didn't happen, but later times i had this dream the last 7 dripped red as if it was paint and the bottom left corner of the background was black.      I don't get it...

There are two or three people in front of me waiting to talk to a therapist. The first two talk fast but the kid in front of me just keeps rambling on and on about how he doesn't have a place in the world and he wishes he could at least find a type of music to help him cope. I finally get so fed up from waiting, but in the mean time im thinking to myself and an idea comes into my head that I’d like to come up with sounds as a way of helping kids like him. Next thing I know im freaking out at my therapist, and tell him I’ve been waiting too long to talk to him and this kid is insane. Than I tell him that if he’s having such issues he should google songs to listen too. Everyone in the class starts laughing. I turn around and he has a tiny gun in his hand and tells me I should decide my own fate. Im like man, you don't have to do that. He pulls the trigger and nothing comes out of the gun, pulls it again and shoots me right in between the eyes. I see the blood coming out of my head; I turn around and fall slowly backwards. As im falling I can see the shocked reaction on everyone’s face. This face I didn't recognize is holding me up and I can barley breath I tell him to tell my family im sorry and I love them, and to tell my boyfriend I love him than I black out in my dream and wake up. Im wondering what all of this means. The kid that shoots me is someone I knew in high school, but never talked too. He was kind of a quiet misunderstood kid. I can barley remember my dreams but this one is stuck in my head clear as anything and I wake up in a panic. Help!
20090223091955AA1nV56	Social Science;Psychology	Cutting off my father?	My father manipulated me into telling me that he wasn't cheating but he was and this caused a rift in my relationship with my mother for years. Had I known what he was doing, I would've told my mother right away. I've been angry for 8 years and finally I opened up to him and everything seemed fine and I was going for a visit.      it seemed like he thought things were going to go back to normal (I'm going to call him "Papa" again and he started giving me advice on my life and he talked sh*t about my boyfriend about how he doesn't think he's responsible just because we want certain living conditions). So I told him that I wasn't having any of it and he can't start acting like a godo father just like that. Also, he's started telling me about his marital problems right away and I asked him not to and he won't respect it and told me to refund my ticket and if I can't "too bad it's your loss."      Like wtf?      I want to be civil with him because he's unfortunately my biological father but he's all "I'm your father respect me!" He doesn't get that respect is earned and he DEMANDS it. For 8 years he wasn't there and just 2 months ago I opened up..can't expect me to be all chummy.      The thing is, I'm doing this for me. To finally fix my "daddy issues." But he's not letting me. My bf says this isn't going to help and it might be better to just cut him off?      Opinions anyone?

I see a girl dressed in something like sleep beauty might wear, shes standing in a green field with a small cottage in the background, shes picking up the daisies from the grass and putting them into a picnic basket which is on her arm.      Then, suddenly, i get an image of my step-dad (Whom i have nothing against, i don't fall out with him or anything, hes a role model to me) hes screaming and his legs are stuck in between giant cogs which are crushing his legs, then it flicks back to the girl picking daisies and im walking towards her getting closer, but i can still hear him screaming. This flicks backwards and forewords until i see the girl up close and my step dad's legs being demolished and all i can hear are his screams.      If it helps, i met him when i was 7 and never seen my biological father since afew months ago and im now 17. I haven't had this dream for awhile, but its on my mind.

I had a very realistic dream of me being in my house, you know everything left as usual walking around the living room when my teeth, not only teeth but gums too started to fall out!!! I began to feel blood gushing down my mouth and i began to worry, and  cry, trying desperately to put my teeth and gums back.  I went up to my mom, and showed her how my teeth were falling out and she just told me to not worry about it and walked away. I then walked into the bathroom, were my sister was taking a shower, and i began to cry hysterically as i saw my whole set of upper teeth still connected to the gums fall out to the floor.  My sister then stuck her head out of the curtain and with a grin on her face and a loud smirk said to stop being such a crybaby and get out!  I then went to my mom again, and once again she calmly said to not worry about it and wait for my sister, (the one who laughed at me in the shower), to take me to the dentist first thing in the morning, i kept thinking to myself (well in my dream, like i said it felt sooooo real) 'i wish this is a dream i wish this is a dream' ......and just as fast as the dream started i woke up!!!! and the first thing i did was check to see if i had all of my teeth.....and i did, and i looked to see the time in the clock in front of me, but the strangest part was that as i got up to get my glasses to check the time, i swear i saw an old lady, sittin in my moms rocking chair, i only saw the side of her, white hair fixed up in a bun just there, the first thing that came into my mind was 'what is my mom doing there' (and remember, i was awake by now!!) and as i turned away to get my glasses and put them on, she was gone! what i then did was look around the whole room, to see if there was anything around that could've made that shadow, but there was nothing so i was spooked out, but mainly about my teeth, i didnt' get scared about the old lady untill then next day when i told my sisters my dream, they made me realize that i had just seen a ghost. im soooo confused on what this means.....please help!!

20090223122406AA7yM82	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Had a realy cool, strange dream today.?	was more a daydream, or fever dream, as i have quite a high fever right now. but it was relay interesting. mainly cause i heard a name ive never heard before.   basicly i was standing at the entrance of a cave.   and i felt like someone was talking to me. the voice. it was a womans was saying i had to go in to save a lady.    i went in, deeeper and deeper, and i heard the soft thrumming of a drum. deep and soft. i followed the noise in the cave, it was light but dark, or no light but no dark. i could see.    i came to a "well" this was realy deep and dark. i heard a woman crying, i called out to her and asked if she was ok, i carried on hearing the crying, beautiful, and dreadfull and sad at the same time, it sounded like sad music for some reason.   the well had stairs going down, curling round the curvature of the wall, as i got deeper i found i could see more. i saw a platform in the middle of the well, i was down quite far now, it seemed it was an everlastin drop.   on the platform, i saw the most beautiful lady i had ever seen, but i could only see her back, she was sitting with her feet dangling over the edge, i knew she was beautiful, even though i could not see her face. she was still crying. then i heard a voice, it seemed harsh but at the same time not, it shocked me out of this strange enchanting dream. the voice said . "isis"  what shocked me was this voice didnt seem to come from my head i felt like it was someone saying it in my ear.nobody was there.   i was bewildered and intrigued. i found out isis is an egyptian goddess, of magic, compassion, the downtrodden. all this stuff. i dont understand this, maybe it was my subconscious telling me what i need to do, i need to stand up for the downtrodden, and all that stuff.  was so cool. whats your oinions?       by the way. im not some kind of hocus pocus person. (dont want to offend anyone who is, as i think it is all very interesting) i am also not a skeptic. i am in between. open to ideas and opinions. m   sorry its so long

20090223124523AA1kSxm	Social Science;Psychology	How can I get round the self-inadequacy thing?	Over the past few months, some things (such as friends moving away, cutbacks at work, negativity of other people) have really knocked my confidence and I am feeling quite low at the moment.      I find I'm worrying over the slightest little thing, and over-thinking lots.  I find I'm a bit distant from people.  I also feel very inferior when I'm around very beautiful people and very confident or successful people - maybe it's because I want to be like them, and not a pathetic underachiever.      What can I do to get round this?      I'm not depressed or anything, and I don't believe in counselling or psychotherapy - it doesn't have any effect on me.

20090223124247AA2KihM	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Any ideas what this recurring dream means?	About two months ago I had a dream that I met this italian man, in his late 20's. He was very funny, and I ended up dating him. Anyway, the dream seems to carry on. Over the past few months, it has continued, and we ended up married, had a child and everything. Then he lost his job and we lost our house etc. The child got taken from us, then just last night, I commited suicide. It was really weird and realistic, I woke up crying.      In reality, I am 16 years old, I have been with my boyfriend for a year and am generally very happy. I wouldn't have worried if the dream happened in one night, but its the fact its recurring.      Anyone have any ideas? Thanks x

20090223132709AAseL1e	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The politics of being a woman?	Well it all started with the comeback of Hillary in the primaries, for me. The media suddenly became very wary of criticizing her and in the final days of her seceding to Obama, some female politician started to accuse others of misogyny, not to mention all her female supporters.    Then she was pushed for VP choice, because the first female candidate is a big thing, then same for secy of state.    It peaked for me, when political analysts and party leaders openly discussed that only a woman must be appointed to her senate seat, and one such woman got the job.    Today's AP story talks about a surge in the number of female candidates for 2010 senate race, openly saying, the rise in the number of female voters have made this possible.       I find it not only sexist but dangerous, that sex of the candidate will be the deciding factor in election. How 'bout you? Do you think women voters will do that?   I
20090223143801AABOrlh	Social Science;Psychology	Why are we all different? Do we have any say in who we become?	From birth, I believe that every person is different. I have identical twin brothers (3 years old) and they are completely different people. I am really eccentric compared to most of my friends and a lot of my school. Why are people unique and different?      Do we have any say in who we become? Often I am impressed at one person for being extremely open minded or at another for being a great musician. But, if we are all different from birth, than should we be given any credit for our uniqueness, given that we had no say in whether or not we should get it?      If two babies are born with free will, and one chooses to be good and one chooses to be bad, than is that really free will? The fact that we make different choices in our lives only supports the theory that, from the beginning, our lives and ways are predetermined?      I don't like the think that I can't be given credit for my amazing musical ability, or that my favorite author can't be credited for being so talented. At 14 years old, my mom won't even listen to my questions, because she thinks that they are 'childish.'

I think negative like 24/7 and it's driving me absolutely insane. I try not to think negative but I do anyways. I don't like thinking negative because I stress myself out to the point that I just wanna curl up in a ball and cry. I have my boyfriend and I don't know why I can't seem to trust him. He tells me that he loves me and that he wants to be with me. I don't have any reason to think that he's cheating on me or anything like that. He told me he's sick of hearing me say that I'm scared that he's gonna leave me all the time so I don't tell him how I feel anymore 'cause I'm scared of pushing him away. He makes me so happy and I love him and I'm scared of losing him. I think so negative and I don't know what to do. All I wanna do is be happy. I'm finally happy at this point in my life. Life's not perfect but I mean I am truly happy... it's just that the negative thoughts get the best of me and I can't stand it anymore.

20090223133504AA7ZhSt	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this weird dream mean?	I was at this place and they kept giving out stuff.      Some stuff fell out of the back of chairs where I was sitting some guy switched pictures with me which everyone called him a liar for not giving us the right picture.      The we had to get this thing out of a jar but it had an eating plant in it so I threw mine but their was one next to me and behind me so I lost the game and the gardener came and he said I had to find the cloud on the bed or on the wall and follow the directions. So I open the door and head over to the bed and look for the cloud-no cloud but I see it on the wall. I pulled it off but as i was pulling it off I see people behind a curtain and another curtain.       When the cloud came off the wall this wooden thing that talked said to find the presser and iron the shirt, so I did and it said good try. Then the gardener came. I woke up after that!      what does this crazy dream mean?

20090223133723AAjiNaH	Social Science;Economics	Are extreme capitalists economic monsters?	I remember people who invented in the olden days did it for the good of the people and for self/country pride.   Archimedes, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Pavlov, etc were never really rich and were not greedy to demand the world pay them to the point of holding others as economic slaves.   Why do they keep teaching us that the only way to development and competition is by greedily feeding the capitalist insatiable appetite for more money and wealth?   Is it not a shame that a country could send people to the moon yet unable to cater for all it's citizens living on our earth?.   Is it not economic monster-ism for few people to hoard wealth and money to themselves while others are loosing their jobs and houses?   Why should reasonable person keep supporting this monster capitalist theory of the greedy?   Time to rock the boat of the extreme capitalist? Anything extreme will never work for ever. Same applies to socialism.   How about maximum wealth and money - just like minimum wage?   Human being is a greedy creature that need to be tamed.   How much does a capitalist need to live a comfortable life and depart this life eventually? And how are we better than termite in terms of hoarding wealth?

In my psychology course, the professor was talking about how there would be a machine of sorts that would hook up to the sleeping dreamer and be able to see the images they were dreaming. NOT able to interpret the meaning, or why the person was dreaming it, but would be able to see the images.       When I took the class, they were getting closer... the professor said this technology could see more like a silhouette of the images, where they could make out that what they were seeing was most likely a building, for example, but that he expected it to be able to show the exact images, accurately, as the dreamer dreamed it, within 5 years.

20090223142212AAa7yie	Social Science;Economics	Economy calculation problem?	Assume that the demand for real money balance (M/P) is M/P = 0.6Y –100i, where Y is national income and i is the nominal interest rate. The real interest rate r is fixed at 3 percent by the investment and saving functions. The expected inflation rate equals the rate of nominal money growth.      a. If Y is 1,000, M is 100, and the growth rate of nominal money is 1 percent, what must i and P be?   b. If Y is 1,000, M is 100, and the growth rate of nominal money is 2 percent, what must i and P be?   (Note: be careful with the measurement.  If it's already measured in percentage term, you need to insert the full number in the calculation, like for example put 3 for three percent instead of 0.3 in the calculation).

20090223141558AAzcckQ	Social Science;Psychology	Is this normal behavior for Grandparents?	When my daughter was born 3 years ago, we were living in my parents' home, because her dad and I were getting divorced. They helped a lot with her as far as babysitting when I needed to work and run errands, and even financial help when I couldn't make ends meet. They were very much in her life because my daughter and I were living in their home, but I was still the one raising her. Since then, I have remarried and have another child. My parents followed a job to a new location about 3 hours away, and occasionally come visit me and the kids. They have been extremely pushy about my oldest child, however, and it has gotten to the point where we have been fighting about her visiting them. They want her to come spend an entire week with them every single month, apart from her family here, and when I put my foot down and say "No, it's not good for her to go off so long so often," they go ballistic on me. They say that I'm an ingrateful daughter, and that they "raised" her when we were living in their home and that she needs them just as much as she needs her own mother. When I say she needs to be with her family they say I'm being selfish and that our family situation is not normal since I'm not married to her father and that her brother is only her "half" brother, as if she shouldn't even be in our household! It's exhausting, and it breaks my heart for these people that I still love very much to get so angry when I just tell them that my daughter, their grand-daughter, doesn't need to be gone for several days every month. She also has visitation with her father 2 weekends a month, and I just don't think turning around when she gets home and visiting her grandparents is healthy. This whole situation has me stressed out, and I just want to ask...IS THIS NORMAL BEHAVIOR for grandparents? Could this be harmful to my child?  Am I wrong for not wanting her to be gone for several days every month? And if this is unhealthy behavior, is there anything I can do to help my parents?    By the way, it's not that I'm saying they can't see her; they have an open invitation to come visit ANYTIME, and I told them she can go spend a weekend with them here and there.   If you can help advise me, it would be greatly appreciated!

In Southeeast Asia put out by Pubmed, and other medical online databases for Anthropologists, Southeast Asia is 50,000 years old at least. with Australian Aborginals at around 70,000 years- So just because some places have a history of under 6000, does that mean Polynesian History should start at 6000?

20090223134235AAom1Ms	Social Science;Sociology	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

20090223101725AA4ufc2	Social Science;Sociology	Respect between generations?	My wife and i recently had a family outing (which my wife organized)that turned out horrible. An altercation took place between a family member and a random person that my wife could have possibly worked with. As it turns out, some words were exchanged between a couple of the family members and the other person and my father-in-law became infuriated. My wife and I happened to miss the altercation and walked up to our family huddled together, where my wife asked the question, " What happened because I may work with that person?". My father-in-law flipped out and screamed at my wife, (who happens to be pregnant and very emmotional) at the top of his lungs in front of all family members. Well, my wife walked away because she was humiliated and knew that a response would only make the situation worse. I noticed my father-in-law sneak a grin to my sister-in-law as my wife walked away so I decided, in a polite manner, to tell him "Mr. soso, that's not funny you just upset her". At that, he jumped in my face yelling at me that he wasn't laughing. My question is, did I overstep my bounds and disrespect my father-in-law by essentially calling him out in front of his family (albeit in a respectful manner) or is he the one who owes me an apology?

20090223113158AAdouXJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Please help me interpret this dream...?	I was asleep and in my dream, I dreamt that I was dreaming. I saw this baby that told me I was supposed to be it's mother. Then I woke up, but was still dreaming (if that makes since) and saw the baby later. The baby told me that it had the same dream. It was only an infant and I can still vividly make out the face. We both knew that i was supposed to be its mother sometime in the future. It was a very odd dream and is bothering me.
