20090202104323AAETwZ1	Pets;Cats	Whats wrong with my cat?  We adopted him from the pound?	On Jan 6th.  He's  a 1 1/2 yr old, fixed, declawed male.  He had been a stray, picked up along the highway.  Had been wet, bedraggled, half starved.  But after a month in the pound, he was sleek, pretty. Healthy looking.  Had all his shots.      The day after I got him, I came down with a severe cold.  That cold kept me in bed for almost a week.      So, the next week, when the cats right eye began watering, I thought he had just picked up my cold.        A few times, it looked like the eye was getting better, but the wateriness keeps coming back.  Discharge turns black on his fur just in the corner of that eye.      A couple days ago, it looked like the other eye was irritated also.       He eats well, sleeps well, plays a lot.  Evidence of plenty of use in his box.  He comes to me to be cuddled, purrs a lot.      This morning, he threw up a little bit.  Not a hairball cough up, but a bit of vomiting.      It took a while to get an appt with a vet, but have one for tomorrow.  In the mean time, my friend suggested that maybe kitty has distemper.      Ya think?      And if it is distemper, and if the vet puts him down, can I get another cat and have it be healthy?  Or, would my house now be full of distemper and another cat would just get sick, too?

I pulled a tick off of my cat 3 days ago, head and all, and since then he hasn't eaten and he's stayed in the same spot on the couch. I looked at the spot where the tick was and there's a bald spot but there's no redness or anything else. If It's not Lyme Disease, what is it?      His third eyelids are showing and the left one is reddish brown looking. I think he's also having trouble urinating.

20090202110207AAsKUTA	Pets;Dogs	Problems with barking?	hi all, I'm having a major problem with my rat terriers barking.  She's been socialized with other people, places, sounds, etc, since she was 7 wks old.  She is almost 11 months now and it's getting to where I can't take her anywhere. She growls and barks at just about anyone and anything that comes across her path. It's not really aggressive growls or barks, it's more like she's either warning me that someone is approaching, or she's telling them to get away from me.  She is very protective of me.  She'll growl and bark at someone approaching, but as soon as they come up to pet her she stops and is friendly.  But most people aren't going to know what a sweet dog she is, and are not going to want to approach her, if she can't stop barking at them!! Please Help???

The yeast mixture definitely got bubbly and active in the 2 liter bottle, but I don't see any air moving down the tube to the air stone in the tank. Any insights from people who have used this system.      If you're about to answer to tell me that DIY systems are unreliable and I should invest in a real CO2 system, save both our times and don't answer.      thanks.

20090202111632AAKGf7G	Pets;Dogs	Dog showing dominance?	My Lab, who is an Alpha dog, has learned to obey me for the most part.  If she misbehaves, for example, if she tries to take food off the dining table or if she jumps up on the sofa and my hubby or my sons reprimand her by saying a sharp "no" she shows her teeth and barks at them as if she would jump on them and bite. She barks and whimpers but still refuses to back down.  I've even seen her stand tall on her hind legs while she was doing this. Several times when she wouldn't stop, I intervened and ordered her to stop and she immediately backed off and ran to my side like a little child seeking protection.            She plays with these guys, even follows them around the house, but for some reason she cannot handle it when they correct her. She's a shelter dog. Is it possible that a male abused her previously or is it typical for female dogs to behave like this with men?

Porém, há um    método eficaz, inodoro e que n?o causa nojo. Primeiro vamos precisar    de:   1) Um pouco de sal;   2) Uma tampa de garrafa;   3) Um pouco de cacha?a;   4) Um palito;   5) Uma pedrinha.   O esquema é montado da seguinte maneira:   1) coloque o sal no caminho das baratas;   2) ponha a tampa de garrafa ao lado do sal:   3) encha a tampa de garrafa com cacha?a;   4) ponha o palito próximo à tampa de garrafa e perpendicular à dire??o    axial da tampa;   5) ponha a pedrinha atrás do palito.   O processo é simples.   A barata verá o sal e comerá pensando que é a?úcar.   - Vai sentir sede e ent?o tomará a cacha?a pensando que é água.   - Vai ficar bêbada e trope?ará no palito.   - Por fim, baterá a cabe?a na pedra e morrerá de traumatismo    craniano...      vcs acham esse método eficaz?.......kkkkkkkkkkk

Our rabbits are our pets and we like to bred them to show our children the wonderful (and no so wonderfulness) of animal life cycle.    However I'm wondering what the hoopla is about the Nest Boxes? In the forest, no one puts in a wooden box for the rabbit--the doe will scavenge and forage for her supplies as required. Our bunny did the same.    Our doe just delivered 6 kits yesterday (so cute) and she took some cloth for the bottom, and actually circular patterned the other peices of cloth, didn't use the extra hay I put in or the sawdust and just covered them up with her fur.    I'm curious if other people have had successful runs of litters without using the nest boxes as well?    Check out the photo below

I have a two year old male cat.  he goes outside durring the day and come in at night ( I dont think I"ll be letting him out anymore though)  He wasnt on the porch last night when i got home from work but i didnt really think anything of it since he has stayed out through the night a couple of times.  I let him in this morning and he had apparently gotten into a fight with another cat (thats what im guessing).  his right ear is shredded in some spots and it had been bleeding pretty good but has stopped now.  there are no other marks on him.  I can tell its causing him quite a bit of pain.  i called our local vet and they said that they can't get im in until friday and that all they would od is clean it and give him stuff to hopefully keep it from getting it infected.  I've cleaned it myself, but with the pain its causing him i was wondering if i can give him half an aspirin or even baby aspirin to help with the pain until the vet can see him....Will it hurt him?

20090202114739AAWfgNX	Pets;Dogs	Dog missing hair question?	My brother-in-law adopted a dog on saturday.  Today I noticed that it has no hair around it's eyes/eyerims, and it also has very little if any hair behind its ears.  The ears in general seem to have very light hair, which is different than the rest of the body.      From working in rescue I know that sometimes there are mites that are related to stress.  I'm curious, could it be those mites?  These are the only spots he's missing hair.      He's getting a bath tonight, and is going to the vet tomorrow for a general checkup, I'm just curious though.      Also, we were going to give him a bath saturday night, but they microchipped him and said that we'd have to wait 2 days to give him a bath.  I've never heard of this, is it common practice?

20090205101308AA7Lijc	Pets;Cats	Help! My cat isn't eating!?	She's an 8 yr. old Female - I've never had such a picky, sensitive cat!     My cat hasn't wanted to eat her crunchy cat food for about 3 weeks and would only eat wet food.  For the last week she hasn't wanted to eat anything. She will eat little cat treats that I give her... but not her normal food.  She has been eating one kind of food and I went and bought another kind to see if she would like it better (She used to like it) -- still not eating.      She is still drinking.. but less then she used to.     I'm thinking things started about a month ago when a neighbors cat got loose and came into our apartment.  I'm sure she's having a hard time dealing with the smell of this other cat... but I'm not quite sure what to do about her eating.    I've done my best to make sure that the other cat is not around, I've tried to clean the floor and the places where the other cat was to eliminate the cats smell.  I've been using Feliway Spray to help calm her down.  I've noticed a difference in her peeing on the carpet (Hasn't done it for a few days).. but I'm out of ideas.   Of course, if she doesn't eat more today, I will call the Vet but I wanted to see if anyone had any advice.        Thanks

Besides, my loss of five points, right? You can only gain from it.      Now, I think this one is pretty tough. If it wasn't my years of studying for vet school, I wouldn't know any of these, so good luck. There are 9 breeds       http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c358/A...

20080319015555AAIZ77R	Pets;Dogs	Kennel Cough in Puppies - any experience?	My miniature schnauzer Puppy has kennel cough. After visits to the vet, and lab tests, she is on antibiotics for her particular problem. I just wanted to know how long the coughing lasts? It has definitely been less frequent than when she first started (say 6-7 times a day), but it's still there and worries me.   The vet said that there should not be any long term damage to the dog, but to avoid washing it to prevent pneumonia from developing. He also said that it takes a few weeks to clear up completely which means that my puppy cannot have her shots until she's completely recovered.    Does anyone have experience with puppies who have developed kennel cough? And how long does it take to clear up? Do they eventually stop coughing completely?

20080710140431AAmayCY	Pets;Dogs	Adopting a 9.5 yr old Maltese - any advice?	Hi. I am thinking about adopting a 9.5 yr old Maltese dog. She hasn't been mistreated and has always been with a same owner upuntil recently (I don't know why they decided to give her up, all I was told was that it was due to "personal circumstances").  She seems to be very well behaved, healthy and properly socialized, etc.  She will be coming to stay with me for a long weekend soon, to see how we get along. My question to all you Maltese lovers and experts out there:  1. Is this a good idea, or are Maltese one owner dogs that will never settle with a new owner?  2. What should I look out for when she comes to stay with me for the "test run"?  3. Any particularly "difficult" breed traits I should be aware of?    Thanks!

I have a kitty cat and for some strange reason it has been catching rabbits. they are a pretty good size mabe about a little more than half the size of the kitty cat. Is this normal? There is nothing I can do about disciplining it or anything. I know it wont stop if I tell it no. I didnt have it for long though mabe a couple of months. It was a stray when I got it. There is an orange cat running around as well but it belongs to someone. Ive been calling it Jonesy. It looks almost like the cat off Alien. So I call it Jonesy. My kitty cat looks almost like a miniture cow of some kind mixed in with like a skunk. Its funny. I got it spayed and got it dewormed and rabie shots.
20081001024715AA7vXVc	Pets;Dogs	What's a good gift to give a veterinarian?	My puppy recently broke his leg :( The emergency vet that I took him to in the middle of the night was so amazing and caring. She really went the extra mile to try to re-set the leg, put a cast on and gave me a list of vets that I could go to the following day. Not to mention that she had to deal with me (in tears almost the entire time) asking tons of questions.    She was unsuccessful with re-setting his leg even though she tried for a very long time. It certainly wasn't for lack of care or effort. She clearly felt really bad about it.   I would love to send her a care package thanking her for taking such good care of my pup and I. What's some good stuff to send a vet besides a card thanking her for her services?      P.S. My puppy is doing well. After visiting many other vets, we opted out of surgery because he is so young and tiny (under 4 pounds)that risking his life with anesthesia just isn't worth it (they gave him a 25% chance of not making it) So he has a cast and pain medication which is making him feel much better. We will re-asses the situation once he is at least a year old if it doesn't heal well and is causing him discomfort in any way. I am told that the leg can be re-broken and repaired with surgery if need be.

I Have been feeding my Shiba Inu 1 1/2 year old raw chicken and lamb patties that I buy from an upscale pet store in California here. He gets 3 patties in the morning and then some snacks in the day and then he gets lotus brand kibble which is a all chicken product that has many veggies and vitamins like an upscale organic kibble. I put ground up chicken on top to make the kibble more interesting. My question is should I switch to all raw patties by lotus since he seems to get loose stools from something in the kibble? He has been having slightly loose stools for months on the kibble and he has already been stool tested at the vet for parasites, worms. etc. Have you had good luck with all raw and firmer stools? I just don't like the expense of going all raw though.

The vet that saw her (her regular vet was not there today) said she heard a slight murmur. She told us dogs her age don't usually have this (too young for it) and was only slightly concerned. she said that we should monitor her. if she has a change in behavior, acts lethargic or shows signs of stress on our walks to bring her back in for further examination.      I'm worried to death now. What does this mean for her? What are some more defined things i should look for? She's such a sweet dog, loves everyone and is so gentle with even the smallest child...i just can't bare the thought of her having a serious condition that may lead to her early death or disability. she was a pound puppy, slotted for euthanasia the day we adopted her. she's been such a wonderful pet, and friend to my 3 other dogs and my 4 children.      Can anyone give me more information about this?   Thank you.

20090205102223AA1DeJY	Pets;Dogs	I need help from dog lovers =[?	I am feel really guilty about getting a new dog. I mean REALLY guilty.      My boyfriend and I have a dog together. it's really his dog, but we are together everyday, and the dog goes everywhere, and so it's basically our dog. He's a chihuahua mix, and the sweetest guy. We rescued him from a woman's house who didnt care about him, and had 10 kids running around and scaring him constantly. I've worked on him a lot and he is more socialized now, but still had typical chihuahua traits.      The other part of the back story. I have worked at a vet since I was 15 now. My first summer there, a woman brought in Chinese Cresteds and I fell in love. I have wanted one ever since.      Well I just got one two days ago. He just turned a year old, he was supposed to be a show dog but it didnt work. he is a "hairy" hairless. He is super sweet, but he doesn't play. He only plays with my cat, or my boyfriend's dog. I know I can get him to play, but I am not sure how?  if I try to play with him, he gets scared. And he doesnt understand what chew bones, balls, rope toys, sqeaky toys.. nothing are. he just gives me a funny face. so in the morning or when I get home from work, he is all hyper and happy, and I dont know what to do! All I can do it pet him. It's wierd. He also doesn't make any noise at all.       So anyways, I brought him home two days ago. The second my boyfriend got here with his dog, I wanted to cry. I feel like I am replacing my boyfriend's dog. I feel horrible. I have been crying all these days. I have a week where I can take him back and have my money back. But the thought of taking him back makes me want to cry too. I realize it's only been a few days, but the guilt isnt getting any better. I just feel so torn. My boyfriend's dog doesnt seem that mad so far, but I love how needy he is of me.    I am starting to think maybe I got a mistake getting my own dog at all. I am also starting to think, as much as I love Chinese Cresteds, maybe I should have just found a Chihuahua, because I love all the expressions, the vocals, the needy part of the behavior. =/      I just don't know what to do. I dont want to keep a dog that I will feel I always treat second best when my other dog is around.   This happened before when my parents divorced, we had a dog at my mom's, and the dog from my childhood lived with my dad. Whenever that dog came to stay with us for a weekend if my dad had to go somewhere, I almost ignored my other dog.      I just don't know what to do!

He has been on benadyll, over the counter ointment, medicated oitment from the vet, several types of antihistamines even some steroids. His paws turn all pink, loses some hair, the inside of his ears look pink, his tummy looks pink and he is starting to itch his body also. He seems to get better with meds but as soon as we take him off the problem starts again. We've recently started to soak his paws in epsom salt which we read on the internet. The vet says we should take him to a derma specialist at this point but it's really really pricey so we wanted to seek help and perhaps do something more homeopathic. He is still a baby. The last time he was on his antihistmine, he was breathing unusually very heavy after play so we stopped the meds immediately. PLEASE any help and advise would be appreciated.

20061028011430AAoffog	Pets;Dogs	Spaniel ear problems?	I have a maltese poodle - spaniel cross, which has been battling with her ears since she was a pup, and is now 8 years old and still has the same problem.  i know that spaniels are prone to ear infections, and she has been to the vet numerous times and taking everything from oridermyl to cortizone.  Does anybody know of a realy good ointment ( herbal perhaps? ) that I could buy at a pet shop or something as opposed to booking yet another vet appointment which ultimately doesnt clear the ears. Genuine, knowledge based help would be appreciated.

20090205111803AAEZoXC	Pets;Dogs	What is going on with my puppy?	My 6 month old Pit bull (possibly lab/pointer) mix has a couple symptoms going on.  She constantly has gooey sleep in both of her eyes, and now I just noticed she has 2 little warts around one of her eyes.  She also has lots of little pimple-looking bumps all over the inside of both of her ears.  The only other spot she has any little red bumps on is the middle of her belly (about 3 right next to each other).  Has anyone seen any/all of these symptoms?        I am planning to take her to the vet, but I wanted to see what other people thought.  I figured she just had a cold and it will go away, but not sure.  None of it seems to bother her besides her ears, which she scratches occasionally but nothing out of the ordinary.      Thanks!

I took her to the vet they told be she has bronchides. But it just doesn't seem like she's getting better. They have already ran blood work and a parvo test and everything came out fine.

20060910010638AAKHjVf	Pets;Cats	My female cat has a growth behind her right shoulder what is it?	I found a growth the size of a grape between Murphy's R shoulder and back. It feels a little squishy, like I want to pop it. It doesn't seem to bother her until I squeeze it (oops). I JUST found it and of coure it's 1am on Saturday (well Sunday). Any idea of what it could be? I am freaking out. She is eating just fine, but it seems like she has distanced herself from me (she used to sleep next to me and for a whil hasn't) like a good marriage, I guess. That's it... what could it be??? THANK YOU for your input. This cat has to live forever...she has been with me for 11 years of crazy.

I have had this cat since she was born and have a very close connection with her (I had to bottle feed her and I carried her around in my shirt pocket when she was a kitten).  Her father was a licker and now she is too.  She will just sit and lick you until it hurts and wont stop.  I almost cant even pet her anymore because as soon as I try to show her affection, she starts to lick me.

20061205155446AAFdTi1	Pets;Other - Pets	Lonely Chinchilla!?!?	I have had my baby girl for a little over a month now she is about 3 and a half months old. She was caged with her moms and pops and brought up around dogs, cats, and ferrets. When I would visit her I would see her playing with the other animals. Now that I have her she is in my room with just me. The only other living thing she sees is my boyfriend. When I let her out (about 4 hours a day) she has so much fun, she crawls on me and runs around. But once in her cage she looks so depressed. She either eats or just lays down and stares at nothing. Everytime I approach her cage she jumps up and runs to the door. I want to get her another chinchilla to play with but I do not have anywhere to place the other chinchilla through the 8 week period that they need to be seperated. The only place I can keep them is in my room, because my roomates wouldn't want them in the rest of the apartment. and I know you can't keep them both together right away. Is there any other solutions?

In the past year she has come to a point that if someone comes to the door or inside it is almost impossible to get her tocalm down and stop barking.  I usually end up taking her into another room and sitting with her trying to calm her down.  I love her to death she is like a child to me but I am at my wits end.  I refuse to get a shocker collar because I think that they are cruel.  Does anyone have any suggestions.  All will be appriciated.

20070117213751AACGWdt	Pets;Dogs	My dog has been driving me nuts this past week...?	...and I don't get it. Nero is a 9 1/2yr old Wolf hybrid (Mix of wolf, husky, and chow - he looks like a Husky with an orange coat), and he has been the absolute perfect dog. He listens very well, he is usually in the house (I let him out into the yard in the morning, and walk him at night). Last week he got out of the yard and was gone for a day (I had called all the vets, put up posters, my bf stopped by the pound etc), since he came back, all he wants to do is go, go, go. In the house, he constantly whines and cries (which usually would only occur if he urgently had to go - he never poops in the yard), he is driving me crazy! I understand there are females in heat out there, but this is so weird...I mean he constantly whines, pacing, running to the door, and when we walk, he is just sooo excited, constantly looking around...hard to describe...

20070122180701AAp45iy	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog itch every where?	She is a 1 yr old boxer mix. We bathed her before we went on vacation to NC. She came along and began itching the day we got there. It has gotten worse! So much so that she actually has scratched herself and has a rash on her belly, rear legs, and privates. I took her to the vet and she just sent me away with an antihistamine and said "We'll see if this works." We haven't changed her diet or anything else about her environment since we got her 7 months ago other than that 1 vacation. My parents dog had a yeast infection..can it be transferred? I am just hoping to give her some comfort because the antihistamine isn't working. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
