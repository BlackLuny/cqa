01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	If you know the basic chords, then force yourself to sit down..everyday, with the sole purpose of writing... at least 15-30 minutes.<br>  <br>       Record everything you try to write...put it away...listen to it a week later.  You'd be surprised at the ideas that will pop out at you.<br>  <br>       When you're away from your guitar...make up little melodies in your head...write them down.  ( I use a form of tab to get me in the ballpark of the melody..because it's hard to remember a melody after a few hours have passed and you hear other music.)<br>  <br>       Keep a small note pad with you and write down funny things people say...or interesting headlines, or billboards that pop out at you...these can all be the basis of a new song.<br>  <br>       Write as though you are someone else..a favorite character from a book, a movie..or that old man down the street.  <br>  <br>       Get away from music for inspiration...go to a museum, see a movie...read a good rock & roll biography. (highly recommended)<br>  <br>       Get a broken heart...always good for at least one or two songs.  LOL<br>  <br>       Steal!   Have a favorite song?  Try playing the chords backwards...you might find a little section that inspires you to creating your own song?<br>  <br>        I used a small section from the Beatles song "Michelle," at a different tempo, and no one has ever recognized that I stole the idea for that song.  This kind of songwriting happens all the time.<br>  <br>       When I had one of those cassette 4-track multitrackers, I used to listen to songs backwards...a wealth of material to draw from.<br>  <br>       I'm rambling, but finally...listen to music you would probably never buy...maybe it's classical, or country, or metal...get out of your comfortable area and listen to different forms of music.     And oh yeah...I agree with another poster...skip the scale study...scales are not musical and are not conducive to song writing.<br>  <br>       Best of luck|`|xTioPxaVaa	Give Stan the points...a great answer.<br>  <br>  The only thing that I would add is that writing songs is no different than learning how to play your instrument....it takes practice.  You're going to write a lot of stuff that stinks, and then one day you're going to come up with something pretty good.<br>  <br>  Hang in there.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|555adb4fb8480541b78851e79f127a7daa	listen to bob dylan and neil young, also get some joni mitchell sheet music.|`|P27lTXEbaa	well, what you want to do is directly related to music theory (ie. chord progressions, intervals, scales.)

If you want to find A-minor look in between A and B on any string. Say it was on the top E string A-minor would be on the 6th fret between the A and the B. Also....whatever chord you turn off of from your chord progression......say you were doing A G A G then you would want to start the riff you do after the chord progression with a G, which in most cases is easiest to find on the D string on fret five. if you have any more questions you can e-mail me at justmadethis123@yahoo.com
AA11363680	Technically Canada did not yet exist as an independent country. It wasn't until 1867 that Canada was officially a nation. Before that it was a colony of England. And her military would have been a combination of British troops supported by a colonial militia.<br>  <br>  So technically it was still an English victory.|`|lz6vAjSEaa	no it wasn't a country so it was just the british|`|e53470e0994050b004790b633a444bd4aa	Canada wasn't constituted into a national entity until 1867. Not necessarily independent, but with home rule. In fact, during our Civil War, the British were protesting that their ships were being seized by the Union on charges that they were helping the Confederates, and they sent troops to Canada threatening to attack us from the back. After a series of negotiations (it wasn't worth it to fight two foes at the same time), Britain stopped helping the South. Two years after our Civil War was over, the Dominion of Canada was declared.

Wicked The Great Musical Ever.<br>  <br>  Wicked The Musical - If you think you know the two iconic witches from Oz — the Wicked Witch (Elphaba) and the Good Witch (Glinda) — think again. How these two unlikely friends end up as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the good Witch makes for the most spellbinding new musical in years.

I saw it on broadway for a christmas present in 08 and LOVED IT! i'd been a crazy fanatic for about a year, but then i actually saw it on broadway. i'm pretty sure i was acting totally nuts that night. i was probably just like grinning ear to ear the entire time and like mouthing the lyrics to all the songs and totally laughing at the hilarious humor. i give the musical a 10! you should for sure go! and buy the original broadway cast recording. <br>  <br>  DEFY GRAVITY!|`|oTHdb4HKaa	its really good|`|1oSL6ozsaa	I just saw it.

2NRCJgq2aa	The war was fought between the United States and the British Empire, particularly Great Britain and her North American colonies of Upper Canada (Ontario), Lower Canada (Québec), New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton Island (at that time a separate colony from Nova Scotia), and Bermuda.<br>  <br>  The war had the effect of uniting the populations within each country. Canadians celebrated the war as a victory because they avoided conquest. Americans celebrated victory personified in Andrew Jackson. He was the hero of the defense of New Orleans, and in 1828, was elected the 7th President of the United States.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812</a>|`|AA11363680	The Americans view it as a victory because they took on England and ended up with a favourable treaty. Of course the military realities are that England was simply too busy with a war against France to devote much effort to a distant war against a former colony.|`|IY9JolQ4aa	There never was a war between Canada and the U.S. It was against the British empire and the Americans.

bHI4NLonaa	Go rent and watch the movie "thirteen days". It is based on the book that Bobby Kennedy wrote about the Cuban Missile Crisis. If you have time, you can read the book. There are so many nuances to this crucial story in our history that it is nearly impossible to focus on just one, because the story is so intertwined.<br>  <br>  My suggestion, if you want to try, is to focus on the cause of the Soviets trying to place long range nuclear weapons in Cuba to begin with. You can look into a failed invasion by Cuban separatists called the "Bay of Pigs" incident, where Kennedy initially promised to provide air support to the invasion with US troops, and then backed out at the last second. Cuba believed that the US was going to invade. There is a tremendous amount of information about this and how some people believe this sparked the Cuban Missile Crisis. I, for one, don't think this is true. I think the Russians though we had Berlin and Turkey, with missiles aimed towards Russia, and they wanted base in the Western hemisphere to launch nuclear weapons as well. A truly remarkable story, when the world was literally hours from Nuclear destruction. Other names to look up about the story follow:<br>  <br>  Robert McNamara<br>  Curtis Lemay<br>  Adlai Stevenson<br>  Nikolai Kruschev<br>  among others.|`|mUIMF3hnaa	Do your own work!

GAhRZHoiaa	The age-old question all of us writers have struggled with (and still do).<br>  <br>  Here's my 2 cents, anyway, as a journalist and author:<br>  <br>  What you're doing now is far more productive than what you were doing previously, because often the personality comes OUT OF the actions of the characters. My advice is to continue to let the characters moving forward, and see what that says about them. Think about it: what we do largely makes us, shapes us (at least in the eyes of others).<br>  <br>  When you're a good way forward with this, start asking yourself WHY the characters are doing/saying what they are. What does this tell you about them etc? It's the same kind of process as when you're in a relationship; you constantly ask yourself "why did this person do this to me//say that to me?) and out of that you start to form your perception of their personality.<br>  <br>  If you read journalistic profiles, you'll see this all the time: the journalist writes about what the profilee is doing/saying (with quotes) and builds a perception of who they are. Hope this helps ... most of all, KEEP WRITING!!
ErraTHpWaa	It is not wierd for a girl to breakdance. There are soooo many b-girls out there. Dont let ppl put you down. .They will put you down because they are not able to do something and they think if they can't do it then you can't.

AA11918249	Hello:<br>  <br>  Think about it this way.  When you finish a book it is not just the end of that book, but likely the beginning of a new book.  Its not an end its the start of something new.  <br>  <br>  The Mayan's had a game where the goal was to launch a ball through a hole...I forget the complicated method...but if you did that you win the game...I can't see that being a celebration of the end of everything.  <br>  <br>  The part that makes the Mayan's knowing that date/when their codex ends is that the day where the earth lines up with the sun that lines up with the center of the universe...I don't know what this means, but I think that alone is pretty cool myself.  I plan to take that day off from work and have a rifle ready and whatnot, but otherwise I'm not expecting trouble.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  Rev Phil

n03LF2Jaaa	Prisoner of Birth by Jeffrey Archer.<br>  <br>  A PRISONER OF BIRTH is  a fascinating, edge-of-your-seat thriller that actually makes a few valid points about the world today. From courtroom to prison to freedom with a glamorous new identity and a burning desire for revenge, the young hero of Archer's book is a worthy contemporary counterpart of Edmond Dantes, the "Count" of Monte Cristo. But you don't have to be familiar with the Dumas original to enjoy this terrific story. It's a good, old-fashioned page-turner that succeeds on its own merits.

To that end, the book that I read on the plane down to Argentina in 2007 (a long ride from JFK in New York City!) was Robert Silverberg's 'Roma Eterna,' a collection of linked short stories on the premise that the Roman empire had not fallen, but continued through history into the modern day. It was long, had a lot of short stories (most of which were good), and was fairly breezy reading and thus suitable for a plane.
AnC1CgRaaa	How long it takes to read depends on you. There are topics covered that one may need to stop and think about while reading. (As you realize, it's not a novel.)  <br>  <br>  Is it any good? That depends whom you ask. According to "Booklist": <br>  "This is an excellent book."<br>  I am probably not alone in noting that some of his Friedman's predictions seem very flawed. On the other hand, Jon Foro declares: "Friedman is well aware that much of what he predicts will be wrong--unforeseeable events are, of course, unforeseen--but through his interpretation of geopolitics, one gets the sense that Friedman's guess is better than most." <br>  You can read more reviews at this link.  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Next-100-Years-Forecast-Century/dp/038551705X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Next-100-Years-For...</a><br>  In addition, you can see a clip of the author discussing the book.

Its called keeping our cities esthetically beautiful.<br>  You shouldn't force your chosen form of artistic expression onto other people. Thats why it is illegal.<br>  Why don't you use your chosen form of artistic expression in a more positive way, such as having it screenprinted onto teeshirts, and sell them at local marketdays, or over the internet. Or do paintings of your graffiti, and sell them on the internet or to interested groups. Thats what other artists do, you don't find other artists breaking the law and putting their paintings on other peoples property.<br>  Join a local art group/hobby class in your local (not internet) community and develop your artistic skills. Or join a beginners art class and learn the basic fundamentals of painting. Develop your skills.<br>  If you enjoy doing graffiti I'm sure you would enjoy learning a trade that involves painting, such as doing a course where you could earn good money, and a living by painting houses and fences. Or do a course where you would learn a trade, such as becoming a qualified car painter. Then you would have the skills and money to buy a cool car, and paint it, like you see, a lot of hot rods, and racing cars.<br>  Hope all this helps. I am only saying all this because I care, and think that all you graffiti artists need is, a bit of direction and guidance in your lives, to set you some life goals, in a positive direction. All the best!|`|oHO0XOQVaa	It doesn't matter where it is when you get caught aside from it being public or private property. Private, maybe they wont press charges, public you're still screwed.<br>  If I ever got into graffiti I think I would start out doing it places that didn't really matter to me but eventually as I got more into it I would be searching for places that would emphasize the messages I send with my artwork. I am the kind of person that usually isn't satisfied through my work unless the interpretation is as good as the visual qualities of the piece itself.

yvyewZrWaa	I know that doppelgangers are a frequent occurrence in gothic novels. I've heard some interpretations that stretch it a bit, but, mostly, there is a theme of good vs. bad represented by somehow similar characters. Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde are often considered in this light, as are Jane/Bertha in "Jane Eyre", Frankenstein/his monster, and Brydon/his ghost in "The Jolly Corner".
BlA60kDVaa	We are Meek.<br>  We are unimportant.|`|AA12181502	Tolkein?  OK I'm not doubting his genius, but what about Kipling, Tennyson or indeed Wordsworth?<br>  <br>  Ther point about Burns is he was born and died in poverty, his poetry was about everyday life and happenings and in that way he managed to touch and connect witha nation!  Tolkien on the other hand was actually born in south africa into a fairly affluent family.  I am by no means contesting his writings as i have read and enjoyed them over the years. Though if you asked the majority of the British public (prior to the films) would the average hoodie be able to connect and relate with him?<br>  <br>  Besides Tolkien night would degenerate into an obsence fancy dress evening that would enable World of Warcraft players an evening away from their screens.  The subtle sound of a harp and eleven music  announcing the arrival of the evenings main course follwed by the "Ode to lembas Bread" recited in High Elfen doesn't really appeal to me.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Tolkien wasn't a literary genius, he was just a successful writer who chose what at the time was a new genre.  He certainly isn't remotely close to Burns in literary stature. There are many other English writers who could be regarded as a literary genius, why not choose one of them? Also Tolkien was born in South Africa, not England - a native born English writer would be more appropriate.|`|7f9556755f69705a513723fb306b1046aa	What Robert Burns did in his private life - which was not so very different to that which 90% of British youth does today -  his writings spoke vividly to all thinking people worldwide and informed their understanding of the human condition - still do,  after all this time. That's what is celebrated - not the daydreams of a restricted mind like those of Tolkein which change the life of no-one.  Try reading Burns instead of just talking about him.|`|uGmEjSLDaa	Shouldn't you have a Shakespeare night or a John Donne night or a Geoffrey Chaucer night? To me, comparing Burns as the father of Scottish literature to any 20th century writer (James Joyce possibly excepted for the Irish, what with Bloomsday and all) is a little bit of a false comparison.<br>  <br>  Burns' 250th birthday just occurred--if you want an Englishman of that era, try Coleridge or (God help us all; the speeches about daffodils would never end) Wordsworth.|`|AA11900069	Tolkien night?

shVgCizBaa	Tower of Babel what did Nimrod Try to Do ?an organized rebellion against the rule of Yahweh. He wants to replace God.  He did all he could to make  people pay Divine honors unto himself.He becomes a tyrant or despot leading an organized rebellion against the rule of Yahweh. He hunts not animals, but rather the souls of men . He wanted all nations came and paid him Divine homage.He ordered the Tower of Babel be built .At the end people started to speak different languages and the tower was  unfinished ----------------------------------------...<br>     Nimrod and the Tower of Babel Since the flood there had been no such sinner as Nimrod. He fashioned idols of wood and stone, and paid worship to them. But not satisfied to lead a godless life himself, he did all he could to tempt his subjects into evil ways, wherein he was aided and abetted by his son Mardon. This son of his outstripped his father in iniquity. It was their time and their life that gave rise to the proverb, "Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness."<br>  <br>  The great success that attended all of Nimrod's undertakings produced a sinister effect. Men no longer trusted in God, but rather in their own prowess and ability, an attitude to which Nimrod tried to convert the whole world. Therefore people said, "Since the creation of the world there has been none like Nimrod, a mighty hunter of men and beasts, and a sinner before God."<br>  <br>  And not all this sufficed unto Nimrod's evil desire. Not enough that he turned men away from God, he did all he could to make them pay Divine honors unto himself. He set himself up as a god, and made a seat for himself in imitation of the seat of God. It was a tower built out of a round rock, and on it he placed a throne of cedar wood, upon which arose, one above the other, four thrones, of iron, copper, silver, and gold. Crowning all, upon the golden throne, lay a precious stone, round in shape and gigantic in size. This served him as a seat, and as he sate upon it, all nations came and paid him Divine homage.<br>  <br>  The iniquity and godlessness of Nimrod reached their climax in the building of the Tower of Babel. His counsellors had proposed the plan of erecting such a tower, Nimrod had agreed to it, and it was executed in Shinar by a mob of six hundred thousand men. <br>  <br>  The enterprise was neither more nor less than rebellion against God, and there were three sorts of rebels among the builders. The first party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens and wage warfare with Him; the second party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens, set up our idols, and pay worship unto them there; and the third party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens, and ruin them with our bows and spears.<br>  <br>  Many, many years were passed in building the tower. It reached so great a height that it took a year to mount to the top. A brick was, therefore, more precious in the sight of the builders than a human being. If a man fell down, and met his death, none took notice of it, but if a brick dropped, they wept, because it would take a year to replace it. <br>  <br>  So intent were they upon accomplishing their purpose that they would not permit a woman to interrupt herself in her work of brick-making when the hour of travail came upon her. Moulding bricks she gave birth to her child, and, tying it round her body in a sheet, she went on moulding bricks.<br>  <br>  They never slackened in their work, and from their dizzy height they constantly shot arrows toward heaven, which, returning, were seen to be covered with blood. They were thus fortified in their delusion, and they cried, "We have slain all who are in heaven." <br>  <br>  Thereupon God turned to the seventy angels who encompass His throne, and He spake: "Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." Thus it happened. Thenceforth none knew what the other spoke. One would ask for the mortar, and the other handed him a brick; in a rage, he would throw the brick at his partner and kill him. Many perished in this manner, and the rest were punished according to the nature of their rebellious conduct. <br>  <br>  Those who had spoken, "Let us ascend into the heavens, set up our idols, and pay worship unto them there," God transformed into apes and phantoms; those who had proposed to assault the heavens with their arms, God set against each other so that they fell in the combat; and those who had resolved to carry on a combat with God in heaven were scattered broadcast over the earth. <br>  <br>  As for the unfinished tower, a part sank into the earth, and another part was consumed by fire; only one-third of it remained standing. The place of the tower has never lost its peculiar quality. Whoever passes it forgets all he knows.<a href="http://www.mythfolklore.net/3043mythfolklore/reading/noahbabel/pages/24.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythfolklore.net/3043mythfolk...</a><br>   Nimrod's name is from the verb "let us revolt."

RLQPWkXCaa	The Greeks stopped the Persian from taking over their territory and becoming slaves. That meant that they kept their freedom. <br>  <br>  At the time, the Greeks had just invented the idea of democracy in Athens, and it would have disappeared under the Persians. Many of the early writers in Athens fought against the Persians, and their victory helped influence their thinking. Herodotus wrote his famous Histories, the first history book in the Western world, as an attempt to explain the causes of the Persian Wars. Sophocles was a young man at the time of the Persian Wars, and he was followed by Plato and Aristotle as some of the great thinkers whose works went on to form the basis of Western thought. <br>  <br>  A little bit further down the line historically, if the Persians had conquered Greece, then there would have been no Alexander the Great. This wouldn't have had that terrible an impact on European history, but there was one surprising effect of his conquests that most people don't know. He conquered Bactria, a region in modern Afghanistan, and set up Greek-style temples there, and that region would become a center of Buddhist learning a few centuries later, which adopted some characteristics from Greek culture, most visibly in the Greek willingness to make sculptures of their gods. Before that, the Buddhists did not make pictures of the Buddha. This form of Buddhism, which featured a number of "helper" saints not unlike Christianity, is the type that crossed Central Asia and ended up in China and Japan.<br>  <br>  Also, Euclid, whose rules for geometry we still learn in school, lived in the Greek Egypt that Alexander conquered. He may be remembered if the Persians had won, but perhaps not. <br>  <br>  Looking back to the West, Greece became a great influence on the Roman Empire. Some say that, before the conquest of Greece, Rome had no real culture. At any rate, the Romans took their poetry, philosophy and mathematics and used them to create the Western tradition. This also became the basis of Islamic intellectual tradition, and many of the great Greek works came to Europe in the Middle Ages through Arabic translations. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be exaggerating very much in saying that the Greek victory in the Persian Wars was perhaps the most influential thing that ever happened. If the Greeks had lost, Western civilization as we know it would be a completely different thing.|`|UR08cIOOaa	It forced the Persians to withdraw from Europe and strengthened the legitimacy  of Greek colonies in Turkey.  Had the Persians prevailed they likely would have conquered all of Greece making them subjects to the Persian King.  This means no democracy but also would have meant no Alexander and no Hellenization of the known world.<br>  <br>  This foothold in Europe could have easily led to expansion into Italy where Rome was just a shadow of what it would later become.|`|HJdsty5uaa	The Persians and the Athenians had some land-control issues, as well as vindictive personalities. The battle of Marathon is considered the defining moment in all of Athenian-badassdom. Basically, the Persians were getting uppity and the Athenians got all up their mix.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	europe would have more brown faces if the greeks lost|`|N86vHKxtaa	Absent a victory, I doubt we would have the deep-rooted affinity for democratic institutions that came from Athens and her cultural dominance that resulted from the Greek victory.  See the link below.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	Several, but here are two. Persia's army was around 10 times bigger than the Greek army. Showing what women have known for a long time: its not the size of your army, but how you  use it.It has been a big morale boost for armies ever since.  Secondly, the Greek defeat of the Persians kept them free, politically, so that they could develop democracy, philosophy, and spend more time killing each other in long fruitless wars (this was an inspiration for the "Bush" guy who just went on vacation, forever).

He increased the the boundaries for the Atlantic for international waters of the US. His denial of trade with Japan regarding raw materials in late 1940 and 1941 played the largest part. Finally cutting off trade of oil to Japan in mid-1941 increased the aggressiveness of Japan which forced the Japanese to go after the Dutch Indonesians who also had oil.

Although born from Baptist parents, he often attended Presbyterian Churches in Springfield and in Washington.   Lincoln did indicate he had been baptized as a Baptist by the Reverend Elkins  according to Mariah Vance, the Lincln housekeeper.  <br>  <br>  Lincoln is attributed to have said the following: "I have never united myself to any church, because I have found difficulty in giving my assent, without mental reservation, to the long, complicated statements of Christian doctrine which characterize their Articles of Belief and Confessions of Faith. When any church will inscribe over its altar, as its sole qualification for membership,' he continued, 'the Saviour's condensed statement of the substance of both Law and Gospel, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself," that church will I join with all my heart and all my soul.'|`|i7nEgSW1aa	He believed in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, he gave all his stuff his cat Mr.Bigglesworth|`|Qo5vSDEdaa	he gave it 2 his wife all of it|`|sPZf98tcaa	Lincoln didn't own a lot when he died but he left it to his wife.

77Nn0gWRaa	you can read the beginnings of other historical romance novels and see how they did it.<br>  another way is if your historical time setting has an event like Titanic, then you could also include a newspaper article (made up) in the beginning. <br>  <br>  another way you could try is have the character be old and then reflect on the entire event like the Notebook. that way, you can get the narrator to talk about how he or she feels about the time period/back then.<br>  <br>  third way is to just get the character to talk about his or her feelings about the time period. make (i'm guessing it's a girl) her complain about it, or think nothing wrong with it and criticize the people who do think it's wrong.|`|S4W7FojCaa	Decide on the time period. Then do a lot of research on that time period. The history, lifestyle ect.|`|AA11866897	Also decide what sort of historical romance, meaning will it be western, regency, Victorian romances or the like. Then as the above answer stated do a lot of research on that time to get a feel for the era, the type of clothes they wore, speech type, etc.  Then you can decide on your characters.

AA11458484	Humans have this annoyingly sheeplike way of seeing and believing what they want to see and believe (being led in any appealing direction)...  I wonder if that will ever change?

I hope that is the direction that we are headed towards.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Religion is a piece of reality.  You don't have to reconcile the subset with the superset.<br>  <br>  Either you feel God is real in a physical sense, in which case, we all have to wait and see but the argument is that He's "Real"<br>  <br>  Or you feel God is an idea, a dream, a fantasy, in which case he is a real concept. not existing in space, but existing in time, and therefore REAL as well.<br>  <br>  Unless you're going to say that anything not physically touchable is not real, in which case I will ask you if you believe in the existence of sound.|`|QlXhPFSwaa	you are an atheist arent u? good point on the sound analogy... i can prove the existence of sound though - through our sense of hearing. unless your deaf. well then i guess that would be my analogy on atheists... they dont believe in the existence of God coz they are deaf coz they can't hear God "calling" them.. or their senses are impaired... coz i can feel God in my life too.. i guess they can't too.|`|buLqy1b3aa	If you don't think religion can be reconciled with reality, then that must mean you believe your physical senses give you a better picture of reality than anything else can.  However, the set of "anything else" is greater.|`|QDaqF6Exaa	actually, the Great Masters as Jesus, Buddha, Mohammad,etc are not tol us anything about 'religion'. They just told  us about the truth from their spiritually enlighten soul; all just the same. But their teaching methods make it looks different. <br>  Religion= teaching method|`|AA10729675	I do not think that religion embodies the Dark Ages.<br>  If you want to reconcile one entity with another, it means that they have been separated by discord.<br>  However, I do not see even any association between religion and reality.  I think that religion is part of reality.  I think that the paintings in the Lascaux Caves in prehistoric times were religious in meaning.<br>  Furthermore, I do not see any illumination of mankind.<br>  If you read Rene Guenon, you would see that for him we have been stupid (that is his word in French "stupides") since the Renaissance. And he proves it.  Again and again.  He was not religious, he was a philosopher.  But he proves that our positivist ideas and all our reasonings have lessened our mental faculties. <br>  Religion being part of reality, does not have to be reconciled with reality.  It is rather reality which means to be reconciled with itself.  Reality is subjective.  Your reality, AquAzul, is different than mine.  So how can we reconcile our realities? Or is it that we live in illusion?<br>  Or is it that Guenon is right and that our mental faculties have indeed been lessened by technology?|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Religion itself is easily reconciled with reality simply because it exists.  Spirituality however is more difficult to reconcile with reality because it is based on emotion and faith, neither of which are easily "proved".|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Faith without Realization is hope,<br>  Scientific proofs without Love are facts.<br>  <br>  There is a continuum of Energy--which is God--and the occasional white raven, such as the healing works of a Reverend Mary Baker Eddy, the living on Light alone for decades of a Saint Therese of Neumann, and the Host of Light at Garabandal, Spain, early 1960s, are well-documented examples of Energy transectings of more narrow scientific "laws."  I.e., the laws of science re Energy are very incomplete, and true religion, based on Spirit, proposes Mind as part of Energy.  Presently, most scientific experimentation re energy is reductionistic and atomistic.  These qualities are reflected in many scientists.  When Love and Mind become more real for these scientists, a truer picture of Energy will emerge.<br>  <br>  "The Path of the Higher Self," Mark Prophet,<br>  "The Mindful Universe," Henry P.

It is an attempt to account for irrationality, coincidence, transcendence, beauty, and love.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most people are more interested in quibbling about the details and the truth claims of religion than in understanding the reasons *why* man has always felt the need to create and hold religious beliefs.|`|g6bBORHxaa	I believe that nothing is for sure but I do have to assume the most logical reason for things. As human intelligence expands and increases more people have begun to realize the truth about religion. That it is just something people have developed to prove that life has a grand purpose. It is a set of unproveable ideas created out of the fear of the inevitability of death. What do religous people think is the purpose of single celled organisms? To be our slaves? Do you think they go to heaven when they die? So what would you have to say about a highly developed collection of cells created over thousands of years? Are they more important? Anyway if this view seems pessimistic it only is if you make it. If you have bought into false hopes your whole life then of course this explaination will seem less admirable. I believe that life is important and that life can be very enjoyable if you aren't tied down by the beliefs of society. Oh.. and sound is just a manipulation (vibration) of particles that ARE actually there but are just too small to be seen with the naked eye. Good try though.
4f99ec15a9237df0f6ae375f2cb22c55aa	Much but in the age of mediocrity. Art has been degraded down to commercialism. OBEY, Coca Cola, Dell  and other garbage that exists only to sell a product takes the power out of art. And communication ceases. Art becomes only that which makes us 'feel good' or heightens the appearance of our kitchen.  Art can be used to open minds or to close them, like in the case of the trash that is often passed off as art and music these days.  When art ceases to be diverse, its dead.  The art galleries are the gate keepers in many ways. Of preventing art which is meaningful from gaining exposure. They also stand to prevent diversity by excluding art and artists of different backgrounds. Such as in the case that most galleries and museums feature few to no black male artists. This is by design and helps to further destroy culture and human evolution.  The death of art is to found in the lack of it.|`|AA11458484	I think good art, in any form, captures something of the evolution of humanity - the times and how they change; our changing mindset and awareness.  In that sense, I believe that art provides a snap-shot of a particular "time" (mindset of that time, feelings of that time, etc.) which could serve as a way of communicating without anything being lost in the communication.|`|g6bBORHxaa	Art is just another way of expression (the most common forms being speech and action), like dancing and music. It highlights the great talent the human brain can achieve on a deeper level than regular thought.|`|jsCfChszaa	liberation|`|AA10729675	Of course there is the benefit of aesthetic.<br>  <br>  I am more pragmatic.  I think it is cathartic.<br>  But I am puzzled by the paintings in the Lascaux Caves, in France.  Prehistorical, magnificent (and threatened by a fungus) paintings.<br>  What did those prehistoric people want to do with those paintings?  Why did they paint those animals?  <br>  They wanted to imitate nature, to tell us what they were seeing, what was important to them?<br>  They still had a benefit from it since they painted quite several paintings.  <br>  The Greeks with their perfect equilibrium wanted to just portray equilibrium and their idea of beauty.<br>  Why can't art be a vehicle of expression for what we need, when we need it, where we need it?  That would be a relief!|`|FyszvGyWaa	how about snob appeal
aKj4ZxAFaa	Hi!, imf rom emxico, but im very experienced in this, i have like 3 best awnser cuz i know how to start, but im not from usa T.T haha wll whatever, the point is that u need a really good resume, u make it with acting lessons, plays in community theater, or in ur school theater, about the skills u have(thats a BIG plus) like, singing, swiming, ice skating etc. any skil u have is a plus, u should tkae more classes than onley acting, when u have make one, you go to opencall auditions, if they like u they will contract u, then with that other plus, u go to an agent agency, theres where u have to get worried and prey a lot! an agent wont represent u if u dont have a grat resume, thats why is very veryy important to have a lot of experience and skills,  when u have give them(the acting agency) ur resume and headshots full body shots (just for the record, its a plus if u give them a short filmed monologue(it can be drama, comedic or whatever u want)) they will call u later for a "callback" thats a "Close audition" and if they like u u r in!! good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S<br>  Opencall=> is where everybody can go, no experienced or experienced actors.<br>  <br>  Close audition (or callback, or closecall)=> only agents can take u there.<br>  <br>  The headshots must be proffesionally taken by.<br>  <br>  And, just a plus in my answer is that u can go to "actorsaccess.com" is a legitim acting agency, theres where all the agent take auditions, what u can do i login, but u have to pay, u can  pay 5 dls per casting or 50 for all the year and u can send all the headshots or clips u want...really good..<br>  <br>  Good luck and good bye|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Whoa, Nelly! Be patient. Go to school, take your classes, get involved in some school shows and, if you still like acting, shows in the community. It sounds like you're new to the whole acting thing, which is fine, but you want to make sure you like it. Acting is great, but while there is a lot to be said for it, there's also a lot to be said against it - the theatre is a stressful, demanding, and often emotionally exhausting mistress, and some people find that they don't love it enough to deal with the politics once they see what it's really like.<br>  If you work on it for awhile and build up a resume and get good at what you're doing, then you'll be in a better position to make your next move.
ZW24GerXaa	1. The newborns dont just bite humans and then leave, they cant yet control themselves so they drain the human of their blood. thats why edward said he couldnt hunt around her or bite her. because then he would go into an uncontrollable frenzy, or not be able to control himself and then drain her. he does end up stopping though because he really loves her. but hes over 100 so hes able to control it better, but a newborn cant control it at all and so once they get a taste of a human, they kill them rather than just biting them and turning them.<br>  <br>  2. He said her blood smelled irresistible because her blood is more potent to him. he can smell the blood that flows through her body, and it smells more sweet to him. But  when Bella has her period, the blood is known as "Dead Blood" therefor, it is unappealing to vampires. also,  she uses tampons (it says it in Breaking Dawn), and so the blood and tampon is still inside of her body, so the vampires dont kno she has her period since it is absorbed into the tampon, which is still in her body.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|KhNXZIWCaa	1. because the newborns were out of control they would suck up all of a humans blood and drain them out completely  but if you just suck a little they turn into a vampire<br>  <br>  2. noo it wasnt its just because bellas blood smelled different to him and better i do not think its because of her period|`|pgHlTuRnaa	Its because only some vamps can stop themselvs before they kill the victom. The new ones don't have enough self controll.<br>  <br>  LMFAO!!! Good one, but no, there was just some freeky magnatisme that had to do with the smell of her blood.|`|4860b78b55d92065268ff509d2c9640daa	Twilight doesn't need to make sense, and it doesn't.<br>  You should just ignore it and forget about it.<br>  <br>  Twilight it literary garbage.|`|fN8Js8aeaa	1) Newborns have no self control , they are really thirsty.  They dont just bite, they suck all the blood because its so irresistable<br>  <br>  2) If you read on Stephanie Meyer's website, she says that it doesnt bother the vampires when Bella is on her period because its like "dead blood" and dosnt make them thirsty lol, Edward is just attrcated to Bella because something about her attracts him, her smell is just really good to him.  For example, someone who loves chocolate cant resist it, it just smells so good to them lol|`|wycisonaaa	1. Edward probably sucked all their blood, and thus killing the humans, before they got the chance to change into a vampire. Also, when he bites, he releases venom so maybe he doesn't inject that into the victim if he's only doing it for the meal.<br>  <br>  2. I don't believe so - it's just that her blood smells better than others. Just like some foods taste and smell better than others. Like trapping an alcoholic in a room with water and a bottle of Jack Daniel's or something. ;)|`|vhiYsLjXaa	1. The venom is used to make the victim in so much physical pain that they cannot move, making easier to "feast" on them. You turn into a vampire when the venom reaches your heart. <br>  2. Edward did say that, but Stephenie answered that question. Bella's period is considered "dead blood" to vampires!|`|6vgTVPtEaa	1. they only die if the vampire that is biting them like sucks all their blood out, and since newborns are out of control, like 99% of the time, they'll just go ahead and just kill the person<br>  <br>  2. because he's never smelled like that type of blood, and it just drives him crazy|`|mO7HcpaAaa	1. because the newborns were out of control they would suck up all of a humans blood and drain them out completely but if you just suck a little they turn into a vampire<br>  <br>  2. noo it wasnt its just because bellas blood smelled different to him and better i do not think its because of her period|`|dHYVE076aa	1. Because the newborns couldn't stop feeding and took too much blood so the victims die. <br>  <br>  2. Uh no? Ew. Vampires have a heighten sense of everything, so he can smell distinct human/vampire/other scents more accutly than a human.|`|GiDixKMfaa	okay well:<br>  1) im not sure <br>  <br>  2) Its because he was in love with her and it was because they wer in love so the scent of her blood got stronger or something like that!|`|tg78TVUBaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! lol......u have to have like a strength to stop, like carlisle said...and as 4 ur last q..., idk....u nvr know! after all, breaking dawn proved that seeing tampons can change ur life 4ever!|`|daza5A4vaa	Well..<br>  I'm not quite sure, but I think these are right.<br>  <br>  When you're not turned into a vampire, it's because you've had all your blood drained out of your body. When you do, your blood carries the venom throughout your body, which allows you to transform. With no blood, there's no flow. So when a newborn drains you, the venom can't travel.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered what kept him from attacking her vagina when it was her time of the month. That's just a plot hole, I think (:|`|anLdtPQwaa	1. Don't care<br>  <br>  2. Gross! I would hate it if my man knew when my "time" was!

I think it's unfair for anyone to not get published when Meyer can for her shallow "work"|`|bE2nn15oaa	Well, Twilight is a mushy vampire romance which is just what many teenage girls particularly, want to fill their minds with - the thought of this perfect guy. Writing about some other topics would certainly not be as favourable for publishing.<br>  <br>  But talking about the quality of the work and the utter ridiculousness and clichés contained within, I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that Twilight is proof that anyone can get published.

Just go to your local bookstore and pick up any book off the bargain bin or go to the romance novel aisle and grab any one of 5 books and you'll see that long before Twilight people were publishing garbage and passing it off as "literature"<br>  <br>  I actually enjoyed the books. I didn't find them complex or gripping or technically amazing--it's just a series of character driven work. If an author can get their readers interested in what happens to their characters then they will keep reading<br>  <br>  What I find interesting is what a hot topic this is. What's the diff? I've despised some books lauded as amazing and wonderful and fabulous and loved other books some people think are nonsense--and vice versa. Who cares? People will read what they want to read, which is why we have such a diversity of books available in the average bookstore.|`|btpoLu5kaa	Yes.<br>  I'm inspired to write a book... Here goes...<br>  Once there was a girl who loved a boy. That boy turned out to be a vampire. I know, this story has been around for ages, and it's totally boring and not original, but guess what... They turn pink in the sunlight. See, changing their skin outside (like making it glitter) makes everyone totally love my now-unique story! Well, not everyone, per se, but at least pre-pubescent girls and the mentally challenged!|`|IRlVBGWOaa	If you think you can do better, then lets see.

rY6wfebpaa	On top of the unforgettable music, it is a great story that hits on some very deep emotions, for example the character of the Phantom is neither completely good nor evil; he is a victim of circumstance and a combination of powerful and vulnerable. Christine Daae's character is torn between two men and the two conflicting sides of her personality, which highlights the emotions of growing up and entering relationships. <br>  The musical also looks truly beautiful; costumes and set wise.|`|a0ncguQ3aa	Well im a really big broadway fan <br>  <br>            first of all the music is amazing its really pretty and was written well <br>  <br>             another thing is its a love story and everyone loves a good love story but it is also very scary so it appeals to guys too <br>     <br>                its an awesome musical and you should really see it if youdont have a chance to see it in a theatre theres a movie out on dvd<br>  <br>  i know you will love it:)|`|G6jUn7qHaa	I have no idea, I assume the music, since the actual play is so boring it makes me want to blow my brains out. The music I'll admit is very pretty, but every time I see it I try to like it (I'm a huge musical theater fan) and I just can't do it, and when I'm so bored I'm about to fall asleep a screechingly high note wakes me up again.

wycisonaaa	Because teenage girls can immerse themselves into Bella, who magically falls in love with the most ideal boyfriend girls can wish for. It's the perfect plot for them; an average girl meets extraordinary guy. (apart from being a vampire.) The series are mainly targeted to that group, also.<br>  <br>  It's not necessarily as good literature as it is just an interesting story to read. & Bestsellers are not equal to quality.|`|S4W7FojCaa	Girls are head over heels for vampire romances.|`|rHrZOSc7aa	Its so good because its about a guy who does pretty much everything for a girl he loves and wants the best for her. It's pretty much every girls fantasy..its a 'hero' (supernatral powers) who adores her. Pretty much every girl secretly wants that<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats why its so popular<br>  <br>  <br>  ps...I'm a fan. But that's really why its popular.<br>  <br>  And you call the author and idiot..but shes making millions off of her "utter garbage" (as you say) saga...so keep laughing at it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :P|`|anLdtPQwaa	I completely agree. It's terrible because it is. It's vapid, shallow, <br>  anti-feminist, the list could go on. It's a piece of garbage. It's actually literally the worst book I've ever had the displeasure of reading. People find it good because abusive relationships apparently appeals to them and the little girls haven't read the classics or any masterpiece literature yet. Good luck living in a twilight world dear :)|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	I admit its not greatly written, but I think its a good story. Im 20, so im not a fanatical teenage girl, but at the end of the day, every girl dreams about falling in love with the perfect guy. And to be honest, guys these days are almost enough to turn me off them completely. Its a romance that draws on young girls desires to experience the whole love at first sight fantasy. Im not going to dislike a book because of the stereotypical fans.|`|uzsfir0Yaa	because they are the best books around. :)<br>  if you were a teenage girl then you would understand :)|`|usvPMtMtaa	i love you|`|NQ0HxnxMaa	Because, girls can relate to Bella.<br>  <br>  I admit that I've read the books multiply time (more like devoured them, but whatever) and I still can't figure it out why.  The writing isn't good and the plot... doesn't exist.  However, when I think about it I guess it's because of the characters.  I personally think Bella is the stupidest character ever, but I can see how people can connect to her.  Edward is severely flawed (actually, he is creepy and should have a restraining order against him), but it doesn't matter because he is pretty and sparkles.  Plus, he gives hope to the weird outcasts that need hope.  People love love stories and they love when love stories seem possible, which, despite being about vampires and werewolves, Twilight is. <br>  Girl meets Boy. Girl falls in love with boy. Boy breaks Girls heart.  They get back together. They live happily ever after.  Yay...?<br>  <br>  The idea behind Twilight is genius, written better and it could have been a simple beautiful story, but instead it just flaunts flawed characters, which I suppose reflects teenage love (right...?) to some people.  I guess I can look at the series and think the real fans are pathetic, which they kind of are.

AA11458484	Well, instead of going to college when I was 18, I did lots of drugs and was in a band...  That lasted 10 years.  After those 10 years, I woke up and had no idea who I was or how I had gotten there... my mind was broken.  I was fat and had done things to people that made it very hard for me to sleep at night for a long time (broken promises... abused trust... enticed young girls who just wanted to be cool... all those things that people in bands do).<br>  <br>  Now, I'm back in college (finally).  I'm happily married, and have a son who makes me smile every day.  I have a great job that I love, and I know what I believe about life and God and everything.  The hold that drugs had on me is broken.  I am able to be creative without being destructive to myself or others.  Life is wonderful.  As silly and small and painful as it can all be at times...  I am just glad I can wake up in the morning now and know who and where I am.

I got told that today. Also it is not bad to exagerate. Put your self in your characters shoes.

A friend. Or someone you can trust on the computer. Also work on adding more feeling instead of say I ran inside. I turned around. It doesn't sound that great. Add more description. If you do that, then you will be successful. Always read what you write.

There are a lot of traditional ceremonies, such as participatory dancing around a central platform ("Bon Odori"), food offerings (fruit, manju..a formal japanese dessert made with sweetened rice flour and filled with sweet azuki beans) to the ancestors in the home shrine, and "Toro Nagashi" which is the tradition of launching a floating paper lantern with a candle onto the water, usually a river that flows into the sea.  The ritual is to help ancestors return back to the spirit world at the end of Obon.  In the USA, Hawaii is the best state to experience Obon festivals (particularly Honolulu) followed by states on the west coast.  The floating lantern ceremony has also been expanded to honor the dead on other occasions, such as Memorial Day in Honolulu.  To make one, a thin, flat piece of styrofoam, tissue or rice paper and four thin stakes, write ancestor name with message on lantern and voila your done!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_Nagashi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_Nagash...</a><br>  <a href="http://gojapan.about.com/cs/japanesefestivals/a/obonfestival.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gojapan.about.com/cs/japanesefest...</a><br>  <br>  Some videos of Obon :<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX59s87VTLY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX59s87VT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neKyfKbq9xg&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neKyfKbq9...</a>

OHgqxc7Saa	Life of Pi is fantastic, I highly recommend you read it.  Also Memoirs of a Geisha is a really great book.  If you liked Brave New World, then you'll really enjoy 1984.<br>  I highly suggest Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, it will make you think, it's one of those books with rich characters & you can't decide who you like.<br>  Not everyone likes Joseph Conrad b/c of his verbose writing style, however if you like books about society then read Heart of Darkness, it is one of my very favorite books, all about the facade of civilization & the inner nihilism of man.  It will make you think. <br>  Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is very funny & interesting all the way through, & full of societal commentary. I loved it.|`|qnwAV6BTaa	You should read Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea it's amazing.<br>  <br>  And pretty much I would recommend anything from Jules Verne, because it's really interesting to see how this man wrote his books thinking how the future could be like, and to see how much he was right about it's really great.|`|G5kyYwhkaa	Awesome Books:<br>  <br>  Charles Bukowski "Post Office"<br>  Chuck Palahniuk: "Choke," "Diary"<br>  Veronica Schreiber "Flash Baby"|`|rv0coacgaa	You should check out this new cult classic: <br>  FLASH BABY by Veronica Schreiber <br>  (similar to A clockwork orange, Palahniuk, catcher in the rye)<br>  <br>  FLASH BABY is about a girl who comes from the wrong side of the tracks and who dreams about becoming a dancer (her father lost her in a  bet--pretty grim) and will do anything to achieve that dream. Then their is a boy who comes from the right side of the tracks who drinks and gambles and causes havoc. The book is about their two lives.<br>  <br>  It's a page turner and you won't be able to put it down. I love it! It's a dark, dark comedy! You'll laugh, cry and laugh again!<br>  <br>  check out her blog: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/veronicaschreiber" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/veronicaschreiber</a>|`|wrI3ITrKaa	the center of everything. i met the author recently and i guess thats why enjoyed the book more but i love that book. um... yeah i'm having a brainfart here about books but i enjoyed that one a lot.<br>  <br>  oh yeah and fahrenheit 451 is also good.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	See if you can get a copy of "Greek Fire" about Onassis and Maria Callas, I forgot the author, but I love their story. Also, Ken Follet is very good, "Pillars of the Earth" is great. These are good to read regardless of your preference.|`|lJcbQ00Haa	Anything by Kurt Vonnegut. My favorites being Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions, but it's all brilliant. Vonnegut is a must.<br>  <br>  Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, Johnathan Safran Foer<br>  <br>  And if you like Palahniuk and some non-fiction, his collection of true stories, Stranger than Fiction is a good read.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	i had chuck palahniuk in mind but you already know about that.

dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	The Cold War began with a strong "Us or Them" feel.  This was the basis of nationalism.   Vietnam was the expansion of Communism into a former French colony, but it was still a "us verses them" situation.  In retrospect, the real question should have been "Why do we want it?"  The answer was simple, to prevent the other guys from having it and exploiting it to expand more.
xk0GAkSEaa	-Scratches chin-<br>  <br>  Alright, very, very cryptic poem, but these are fun, so lets kick this pig. =D<br>  <br>  Alright, this metaphor here... "In every heart there is a god of flowers, just waiting to stride out of a cloud and lift it's wings." I don't quite understand this bit, but that's just me. It talks about a god of flowers, which I assume means a god of incredible beauty, or just flowers (Lol), but the next part is a bit confusing. Why would a flower god stride out of a cloud to lift it's wings? I'd think that a flower god would be like an earth god, not a flying one.<br>  <br>  Kookaburras are birds if I remember correctly. What I want to know, is why is it that you regret not opening a cage for the birds? This next part also requires some close analysis. It says you are not yet a god of even the palest flowers, and you lie in the dark, heart pounding. Are you referring to yourself as someone who has not emerged from the greatness they can actually be, and you're scared of the future if you make the wrong choices? It seems like a rather hidden metaphor. Maybe I just fabricated it. The metaphor however, is very powerful.<br>  <br>  Very, very good poem.
BBfIXcI0aa	I haven't read the play, but my friend did, and we just talked about it in my theatre class.<br>  I think, in that play especially, it IS played a lot for laughs, but it also makes a statement. When you have something as blatant as the crossdressing in that show, it makes a statement about gender roles, but it also serves to make sure the audience sees the other statements the show is making. By using that technique to keep you remembering that it's a show, to keep you from taking that last little step into Entertainment Land, it forces you to really consider what's HAPPENING on stage, and how that is influenced by or reflects what happens or doesn't happen in the real world.

Also, The Lion King is a fabulous and deeply moving show that appeals to all ages.
6yLhXxhYaa	A lot of girls her age are into 'Wicked', but make sure you ask her beforhand. But yes, I highly, HIGHLY recommend Wicked for someone her age. You'd be able to enjoy it as well as an adult.|`|huPGoIU8aa	I highly recommend Wicked. it is a great show for children her age and even for adults, so you would like it too. I also recommend Big River. it is a musical based on the book The Adventures of Huckleberry Fin. Also, i don't particularly care for this one, but High School Musical is good for her age. It is originally a movie but many places are working with it now as a play. Zombie Prom is a great story that her age would enjoy. Also, Big Friendly Giant is a good play i'm sure she would love.|`|vYfzmlOvaa	hm... that would depend where you lived.... I was in a play called Seussical the Musical, and it is great for younger kids because it is ALL about Dr. Seuss' characters so you would have to expect vivid costumes!<br>  <br>  Also, try Wicked. It's about the witches from the Wizard of Oz. It is very cute, and you may be able to find the understudies.<br>  <br>  I'm more into tragic theaters, so I can't exactly help you here.|`|EkgZeAbqaa	annie might be good. it has good music and has kids in it

This was achieved initially through economies of scale and economies of scope, but it also led to a much more efficient and cost effective method of business management based on specialization in different departments of a business.<br>   By the 1900s, managerial capitalism had spread across all business operations in the USA and spread to Europe. Today, almost all capitalist business enterprises around the world are organized and run on the basis of managerial capitalism, so this is something the Americans definitely invented, developed (by the 1890s Harvard University was offering degree courses in management) and spread around the world.|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	The light bulb<br>  The telephone<br>  The cotton gin<br>  The airplane<br>  The telegraph<br>  The atomic bomb<br>  The phonograph|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Americans invent new things every day.

If you are in contact with her in any manner, in person, on the phone, text messaging, or internet, you are in direct connection with her.<br>  <br>  You say you talk to her online, the question is how well do you know her?  Do you know her name and where she lives? Does she live nearby so that she could reasonably attend a dance?  If she is in California and you are in New York, well, guess what, she isn't coming to your dance.  <br>  <br>  If you talk everyday and use her actual name rather than a web name AND she is in your county AND she likes you enough to talk regularly, then go ahead and just say "sarah"(not princess greeneyes), I have a dance coming up soon and would love to take you to the dance.

p0AUrLgwaa	In a nutshell, no, the New deal was a flop. The thing that pulled the U.S. out of the depression of the 1930s was WW2. The nations industry geared up to supply the British and the Soviets in their fight against the Nazis. That's what put Americans back to work, not Socialist programs. If anything, the new Deal slowed down the economic recovery.

UPSK9DxJaa	He collectivized the farmland, which kind of screwed the people over in the end;<br>  <br>  He shifted production of goods from domestic goods to military goods;<br>  <br>  He really focused on the military aspects of Soviet society, rather than the needs of the people. <br>  <br>  Look up Stalin's Five Year Plans.<br>  <br>  Look at the link I've included.<br>  it's from my Euro textbook site, and is really helpful.|`|lPxVt2XYaa	Russia under the Tsars was an extremely backwards country.  The majority of people were peasants farming small plots of land, The Soviet Union before Stalin was still a backward, almost medieval country, roads were unmade, most people lived in villages in wooden houses and had no electricity, the country did have some factories producing textiles, iron & steel and armaments, but these were concentrated in a few cities.<br>  Under Lenin, the New Economic Policy had nationalised the banks and these large factories, but small industries and farming were pretty much left alone.  Russia's economy in 1924, when Lenin died, had only just recovered from the effects of WWI and the Civil War - in other words, it was in the same position as it was in 1913.<br>  Stalin wanted to make the Soviet Union a modern industrial country, able to compete economically, socially and politically with the West.  To do this he began a series of Five Year Plans (FYP) and collectivised agriculture.<br>  The Five Year Plans built vast factories in places like Stalingrad, Leningrad and other cities across the Soviet Union. They also built hydro-electric dams, canals, railways and other infrastructural projects. The aim of them was to modernise Soviet industry, to try to bridge the gap between the Western Democracies (including, after 1933 Nazi Germany).  They were also designed to create a massive urban working class, to electrify most of the country and, in the cities, to build new apartments for the new workers. <br>  The Five Year Plans were put to the test in 1941, when the Soviet Union was invaded by the Germans.  The FYPs provided the economic, political and social conditions that allowed the country to absorb the Nazi assault, to move entire factories to the safety of the Ural Mountains and to eventually push the Germans all the way back to Berlin.<br>  The aims of collectivisation were; to create a rural working class - peasants were paid wages (lower than urban workers) and the land and machinery was now owned by the collective. Collectivisation as also designed to modernise farming practises to create a surplus to sell abroad for hard currency and to free up manpower as they wee needed in the new factories; and finally it was designed to break the peasants as a political force. Peasants in the Soviet Union were deeply religious and conservative, and were seen, therefore, as a threat to the regime - the terroristic party The Socialist Revolutionaries had been mostly drawn from the peasantry. <br>  <br>  However, the human cost of the policies was terrible. Industrialisation was harsh - being late for work was an arrestable offence, many were arrested or for "wrecking" - i.e. when a machine broke or when someone made a mistake at work, and political prisoners were used as slaves on many of the big infrastructure projects, notably on the White Sea Canal. The Holodomor - the Ukrainian famine caused by collectivisation killed about 2.5 million, and peasants resented having their land taken from them, but complaining could also lead to arrest, deportation or death.<br>  <br>  See:<br>  Stalinism & After - Alec Nove<br>  The Soviet Union 1917 - 1991 by Martin MacCauley<br>  <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1942/russian-economy/ch04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevs...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/collectivisation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/col...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.holodomor.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.holodomor.org/</a>|`|shVgCizBaa	Changes in Soviet society                                                     Stalin's industrial policies largely improved living standards for the majority of the population, although the debated mortality levels resulting from Stalinist policies taints the Soviet record. <a href="http://www.indopedia.org/Joseph_Stalin.html#Stalin_and_changes_in_Soviet_society" rel="nofollow">http://www.indopedia.org/Joseph_Stalin.h...</a><br>  <br>  Employment, for instance, rose greatly; 3.9 million per year was expected by 1923, but the number was actually an astounding 6.4 million. By 1937, the number rose yet again, to about 7.9 million, and in 1940 it was 8.3 million. Between 1926 and 1930, the urban population increased by 30 million. Unemployment had been a problem during the time of the Tsar and even under the NEP, but it was not a major factor after the implementation of Stalin's industrialization program. The mobilization of resources to industrialize the agrarian society created a need for labor, meaning that the unemployment went virtually to zero. Several ambitious projects were begun, and they supplied raw materials not only for military weapons but also for consumer goods. <br>  <br>  The Moscow and Gorky automobile plants produced automobiles that the public could utilize, although not necessarily afford, and the expansion of heavy plant and steel production made production of a greater number of cars possible. Car and truck production, for example, reached 200,000 in 1931. Because the industrial workers needed to be educated, the number of schools increased. In 1927, 7.9 million students attended 118,558 schools. This number rose to 9.7 million students and 166,275 schools by 1933. In addition, 900 specialist departments and 566 institutions were built and functioning by 1933. <br>  <br>  The Soviet people also benefited from a degree of social liberalization. Females were given an adequate, equal education and women had equal rights in employment, precipitating improving lives for women and families. Stalinist development also contributed to advances in health care, which vastly increased the lifespan for the typical Soviet citizen and the quality of life. Stalin's policies granted the Soviet people universal access to health care and education, allowing this generation to be the first not to fear typhus, cholera, and malaria. The occurrences of these diseases dropped to record-low numbers, increasing life spans by decades. <br>  <br>  Soviet women under Stalin were also the first generation of women able to give birth in the safety of a hospital, with access to prenatal care. Education was also an example of an increase in standard of living after economic development. The generation born during Stalin's rule was the first near-universally literate generation. Engineers were sent abroad to learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on contract. Transportation was also improved, as many new railways were built. Workers who exceeded their quotas, Stakhanovites, received many incentives for their work. They could thus afford to buy the goods that were mass-produced by the rapidly expanding Soviet economy. --------------<br>  Industrialisation of the USSR World War I and the Russian Civil War had a devastating effect on the country's economy; industrial output in 1922 was 13% of that in 1914. Under Stalin's direction, the New Economic Policy, which allowed a degree of market flexibility within the context of socialism, was replaced by a system of centrally-ordained Five-Year Plans in the late 1920s. These called for a highly ambitious program of state-guided crash industrialisation and the collectivisation of agriculture. In spite of early breakdowns and failures, the first two Five-Year Plans achieved rapid industrialisation from a very low economic base. The Soviet Union, generally ranked as the poorest nation in Europe in 1922, now industrialised at a phenomenal rate, far surpassing Germany's pace of industrialisation in the 19th century and Japan's earlier in the 20th. <a href="http://www.indopedia.org/Joseph_Stalin.html#Stalin_and_changes_in_Soviet_society" rel="nofollow">http://www.indopedia.org/Joseph_Stalin.h...</a><br>  <br>  With no seed capital, little foreign trade, and barely any modern industry to start with, Stalin's government financed industrialisation by both restraining consumption on the part of ordinary Soviet citizens, to ensure capital went for re-investment into industry, and by ruthless extraction of wealth from the peasantry. In specific but common cases, the industrial labor was knowingly underpaid. First, there was the usage of the almost free labor of prisoners in forced labor camps. Second, there was frequent "mobilisation" of communists and Komsomol members for various construction projects. -----------<br>   Collectivisation in the USSR  Stalin's regime moved to force collectivisation of agriculture. The theory behind collectivisation was that it would replace the small-scale un-mechanised and inefficient farms with large-scale mechanised farms that would produce food far more efficiently. <br>  <br>  Collectivisation meant drasti

WPao1l5naa	Considering you are actually speaking directly to the audience, I do not think it could be considered a monologue. A monologue is more of a character. This is more of a storytelling piece. Like narrative theatre. I like the piece though.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Is it a monologue? Well, it's one person talking - if they're talking to someone else, it's a monologue, if they're talking to themselves it's a soliloquy, and if they're talking straight to the audience it's an aside. But is it a GOOD monologue? Not really. For one, it's a piece of narration - a good monologue will have one character talking to a single other character, trying to get something from them, interacting with them. There is also no sense of the context of the piece. Who is the actor talking to? Why do I care? Why do THEY care? Finally, there is very little emotion to it - sure, things have happened, but they were mostly in the past. A good monologue, like a good play, will have an arc, a beginning, middle, and end, and emotional variety.

shVgCizBaa	The impact of the west was also felt for the first time in China. Great Britain especially was interested in trading with China for silk and tea. However, the British did not have anything that was easy to import to China until they began importing opium. This was devastating to China. Many became addicted to opium, and land that had previously been used for food began to be used to produce opium. Also, a large amount of Chinese money left the country in payment for the opium. Finally, in 1839 A.D. the opium trade was abolished. This set off a war with Great Britain that came to be known as the Opium Wars, and in 1842 A.D., China was forced to sign a treaty in which Great Britain received Hong Kong, and ports were opened to European trade. The terms of this treaty were not fully carried out by either side, and in 1857 A.D., fighting again broke out. The British again won and the Chinese were forced to grant more privileges to the British, that virtually turned China into a British colony.<a href="http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/qing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/c...</a>           But during the nineteenth century, Qing control weakened. Britain's desire to continue its opium trade with China collided with imperial edicts prohibiting the addictive drug, and the First Opium War erupted in 1840. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanjing.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>   In 1839 the refusal by Qing Dynasty authorities to import opium resulted in the First Opium War between China and Britain. Hong Kong Island became occupied by British forces in 1841, and was formally ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking at the end of the war. The British established a Crown Colony with the founding of Victoria City the following year. In 1860, after China's defeat in the Second Opium War, Kowloon Peninsula south of Boundary Street and Stonecutter's Island were ceded to Britain under the Convention of Peking. In 1898 Britain obtained a 99-year lease of Lantau Island and the adjacent northern lands, which became known as the New Territories.[24]<br>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong#History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong#H...</a>|`|AA12095483	Admiral Waddell first landed on Chinese shores in 1637 - and he 'found' China by the simple advent of sailing around until he came to land.

W1h3w5gdaa	People fear public speaking more than they fear death, according to scientific surveys. It's no surprise that actually performing a song is even more nerve-wracking. <br>  <br>  I wish there were some secret formula to getting over it. For me, it took about a year of regularly being on stage for me to not worry about it whatsoever. <br>  <br>  My first step was that I sang with my eyes closed. This has the benefit of not only isolating your focus, but having a dramatic affect on your stage presence. But you don't want to overdo that, or do it forever.<br>  <br>  One idea is to make sure that someone comes to see you sing, someone who you are comfortable singing in front of. When you open your eyes, focus on that person. Make eye contact, and sing just for him or her.<br>  <br>  The fact is, however, like with anything else, there is no substitute for experience. You will be nervous the first several times, your voice will warble and people will know you're nervous. (Sing for forgiving crowds, like church congregations.)<br>  <br>  After a couple handfuls of performances, it will get easier. Convince yourself that you're good, first, then go up there with the goal of proving it to everyone else. The more confidence you fake, the more you will build.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck; just be brave and don't let apprehension stop you from doing what you want to do.|`|681bw4g0aa	because you are scared of what people will think

UEAdAuqbaa	Try laying down on the floor and singing. You automatically do it then, and you can feel the muscles and air moving in your body and it helps a lot. :)<br>  <br>  As for singing the way you speak, try and keep air behind your teeth. I know that sounds completely absurd, but imagine you are singing with a british accent. It helps and it makes things sound much rounder and proper. :)|`|V2BvV8rlaa	<a href="http://answersin.frasesde.com.br" rel="nofollow">http://answersin.frasesde.com.br</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.
fcf8a9da7cd0ed8382f55b3b1bc00293aa	Hitler was part of the tripartite pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. It required any member to come to the aid of any other member who was attacked. Of course, Japan was not attacked on Dec. 7, 1941:  They attacked Pearl Harbor. However, Hitler had hoped that the Japanese, in Manchuria, would fight against the Russians and pin them down there, giving Hitler more breathing room on his eastern front, in Russia. Instead, Japan signed a non-aggression pact with Russia. It served Hitler right, as he had a habit of breaking alliances himself (Russia, for example). Along the same lines, he had hoped that the Finns would sweep down from the north and help him win in Leningrad. He was mistaken.|`|wvkidaY9aa	There's a lot of reasons why Hitler went to war. One of them was the fact that egocentric fool, but there was a lot more. <br>  For one, Hitler had built up nationalism, and had improved the economy and infrastructure in Germany. The Germans were still angry about being screwed over after WWI and the Treaty of Versailles, and were rumbling for revenge. Under Hitler, they had enough resources, reasons, and energy to go to war. Hitler, along with everyone else in Germany, felt the same vindictive spirit (even though he wasn't from Germany; he was actually from Austria-Hungary), and also saw the opportunity to build up an empire. <br>  Much like WWI, the Germans were a lot more prepared for war, had a clear reason to go to war, and thought that they could win the war quickly and easily. <br>  Despite all this, the easy reason for Hitler going into the war is because he didn't have a choice: war was declared on him after the invasion of Poland.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Both Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. after the U.S. declared war on Japan in December, 1941. <br>  <br>  The three major Axis powers - Germany, Italy, and Japan - were part of a military alliance on the signing of the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, which officially founded the Axis powers.<br>  <br>  The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary (November 20, 1940), Romania (November 23, 1940), Slovakia (November 24, 1940) and Bulgaria (March 1, 1941). The Italian name Roberto briefly acquired a new meaning from "Rome-Berlin-Tokyo" between 1940 and 1945. Its most militarily powerful members were Germany and Japan. These two nations had also signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with each other as allies before the Tripartite Pact in 1936.<br>  <br>  It would appear that Hitler and Mussolini were legally required to declare war against Japan's enemies.|`|AA11363680	He declared war on the US in support of his Japanese allies, with the expectation that the Japanese would return the favour and help against Russia. Instead the Japanese signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR.<br>  <br>  He didn't honour the treaty because he felt obliged to, but simply because he expected to gain from it.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	Interesting question.  I have starred it.<br>  Hitler had no care or respect for legal obligations.  He observed them when there was some other end he had to gain by doing so.<br>  <br>  In this case it is worth considering the Holocaust.  With no Americans observing in Europe, the final solution would be truly Europe-wide.  It is surely more than a coincidence that the Wannsee Conference took place a couple of months later, in February 1942.  'Europe will be combed from end to end.'|`|lcg1u1U7aa	Hitler had entered into a pact with Italy and Japan that had declared mutual defense and assistance.  Although Hitler's advisers, particularly Von Ribbentrop, felt that it was a mistake and that the language of the pact would have allowed Germany to stay out of a Sino-American war Hitler felt that the terms of the pact must be upheld and he declared for war.  If you really want to learn more about the subject I would recommend "World War Two" by John Keegan.
SYsLzNMSaa	It's always great to have another writer in the world!<br>  <br>  I think the story sounds interesting and you should definitely finish it.  If you decide to flesh it out to a full-length book manuscript, I would recommend www.thisispush.com if you are looking to get published.  Even if you're not thinking of publishing, I would definitely save this url, it's a great publisher for new teen writers and they have a yearly novel contest that you may be interested in.<br>  <br>  As far as constructive criticism, it seems like you are trying to fit too many ideas into the opening paragraph of your story, and it flows along a bit too fast to gain a firm grasp on the images and feelings in your story.  It's a very free-writing, brain-storming style of writing because you've just started, but when you finish deciding what the story is about and get to work writing the final copy, I would organize it more efficiently.<br>  <br>  What you have right now is, of course, pretty vague.  In moderation this draws interest in the story, but remember to elaborate before proceeding to each new theme so the reader doesn't become too confused at first.<br>  <br>  I would start by describing the scene (the peachy-yellow of the house, the broken steps), then commentary (the agony), briefly why you are there, and then finally the thoughts at the beginning of the paragraph.  The "strange man" seems like it should be left for a little later, after you have fully described what is happening.  From what I've read so far, he seems to be the mystery of the story, so the writer needs sufficient context before beginning to speculate on what is happening.<br>  <br>  Watch the clichés!  Haha.  You sound like a terrific writer; don't be so apologetic about it.  I would definitely read your story if it was a book=]<br>  <br>  I'll send you my email if you'd like, just add a note to your answer (my email is hidden on my profile).

iT9S20zvaa	Well then, if you love Gone With the Wind, how about something long and epic?  The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas has love, betrayal, honor, revenge...the whole nine yards.<br>  <br>  North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell (not the same book mentioned in another answer; different author; different book)--- I just love this story.

It is an excellent film adaptation.)<br>  <br>  I definitely second Victor Hugo's Les Miserables.  It may take a while to read the whole thing, but it is worth every single page.<br>  <br>  If you'd like another love story (this is me assuming), you might want to try Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte.

The print-on-demand program is $30 per year, and actual print costs are fairly low (around $11 for an 8x10 I think, and all prints have a 1" white border). The quality is outstanding. You can also set up your own custom shopping page. The only problem is they can't print numbered editions directly. What I have been doing for that is to print a couple, ship to myself, sign and number, then offer those for sale. Oh, and they don't use standard sizes, so if you have something tall and skinny, that's how it'll print.

yvyewZrWaa	Richard III is kind of like Macbeth in that he was power-hungry to the point of murder, if you believe that he killed his nephews in the tower.<br>  <br>  Catherine the Great was similarly desirous of political strength -- I mean, she didn't go around slitting peoples' throats, but she married a mentally retarded guy in order to get the throne. I don't know if I'd go about comparing her to Macbeth, though . . .<br>  <br>  Several of the Chinese monarchs, the best example being Zhu Wen (killed the Tang Emperor, established the Liang Dynasty, and later murdered by his own son, who was subsequently killed by another son -- and then the Tangs came back again, so it was all for nothing), were ruthless when it came to keeping/gaining power.

The play is thought to have been written in the later part of 1606, three years after James I, the first Stuart king, took up the crown of England. James I was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots (cousin to Elizabeth I) and this less-than-direct connection meant that James was eager to assert any legitimacy he could over his right to the English throne (even though he was a Scot).<br>  <br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Macbeth|`|ceBTTCPwaa	Macbeth was a historical person.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare's principal sources for the tragedy are the accounts of Kings Macbeth, Duff, and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of England, Scotland and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries.<br>  <br>  Mac Bethad mac Findlaích (Modern Gaelic: MacBheatha mac Fhionnlaigh), anglicised as Macbeth, and nicknamed Rí Deircc, "the Red King" (died 15 August 1057), was King of the Scots (also known as the King of Alba, and earlier as King of Moray and King of Fortriu) from 1040 until his death.

Anne Frank can be good or bad, depending on which volume you get. Get type A for all the details that go on in her head or type D to learn what is happening in one fast-paced book.

n03LF2Jaaa	Vincent By Don McLean <br>   "Vincent" is a song by Don McLean written as a tribute to Vincent Van Gogh. It is also known by its opening line, "Starry Starry Night", a reference to Van Gogh's painting Starry Night. The song mentions the title of a different painting by Van Gogh in each of its stanzas. "Starry Starry Night" is one of the most famous opening lines of any song in history.<br>  <br>  Don McLean wrote the lyrics in 1971 after reading a book about the life of the artist. The following year, the song became the #1 hit in the UK and #12 in the USA. For several years, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam played the song daily. A copy of the sheet music is in a safe beneath the museum, along with a set of Van Gogh's paint brushes, the hat he wore while painting Starry Night, and various other items.<br>  <br>  In 2000, PBS aired Don McLean: Starry, Starry Night, a concert special that was filmed in Austin. The song itself was an even bigger international hit than American Pie. In 1972, it reached number 1 in the UK and number 12 in the USA.<br>  <br>  Part of "Vincent" is played at the end of a Simpsons episode entitled "'Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky".<br>  <br>  The lyrics, "Paint your palette blue and gray" reflect the prominent colors of the painting, and are probably a reference to Vincent's habit of sucking on or biting his paintbrushes while he worked. The "ragged men in ragged clothes" and "how you tried to set them free" refer to Van Gogh's humanitarian activities and love of the socially outcast as also reflected in his paintings and drawings. "They would not listen/They did not know how" refers to Van Gogh's family and some associates who were critical of his kindness to "the wretched." "How you suffered for your sanity" refers to the schizophrenic disorder from which Van Gogh suffered.

9iElNpSSaa	That is a tough question and you might have to do some searching to find one, but it is possible.  Unlike the wooden clarinets produced today, the dimensions of the barrels of old metal clarinets varied greatly from one manufacturer to another.  Some of the best metal clarinets, including the Selmers, Kings, and Bettoneys, all used very different barrels and they were not interchangeable from one brand to another.  The issue is more complicated because often there is no indication of the instrument manufacturer on the barrel.  Sorry, I don’t mean to be too discouraging.<br>  <br>  There is hope.  Here are some links to look into.  There are many metal clarinet experts who frequent the Woodwind bulletin board.  This link has some information about metal clarinets and perhaps you could contact them to see if they can help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://test.woodwind.org/clarinet/BBoard/read.html?f=1&i=269013&t=269008" rel="nofollow">http://test.woodwind.org/clarinet/BBoard...</a><br>  <br>  You can also try the H. N. White site:  <a href="http://www.hnwhite.com/Clarinets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hnwhite.com/Clarinets.htm</a><br>  Even though they are dealing with King instruments, they might offer some help.<br>  <br>  You may be able to get someone to make a barrel specifically for your instrument, too.  I hope you can find one.  Just don’t turn the clarinet into a lamp!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pNxuvKUOaa	There's a site called www.silver-clarinet.com that might be able to help you- BUT- if they charge you like $30 to $50 for a barrell don't buy it. Your Pan-American clarinet is not very valuable (well built but common) and you can buy decent metal clarinets on Ebay for well under $100.00  Metal clarinets can be nice to play, the tough part is finding someone who will repair them- it isn't easy.
usvPMtMtaa	I'd hang myself<br>  but I'm really not that thick, to write a book as derivative and unimaginative as twilight|`|pUWszP1Uaa	That would never happen...|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Well, it wouldn't happen.

0emslEdiaa	That's a tough one.  I checked Dean Koontz web site and I searched for his books by genre.  Some of his novels were listed in more than one genre.

I've read a good 75% of all his novels and I would have to say that the majority of them are horror/suspense.

Xqno8BTKaa	Generally, the more you pay, the better the shoes. All of the best shoes companies (Supadance, Dance Naturals, Ray Rose) cost more than $49.99. Plus, how often do you have to buy new shoes? A decent pair of shoes should last for a good length of time, and if you buy a quality shoe you know they'll be well made and have a metal shank. If you're going to be dancing for that much each week, it's definitely worth investing in a good quality pair of shoes, they'll last longer and be better for your feet.
wLgGD63raa	Stephenie Meyer wrote the Twilight series, a book about vampires... which I find funny because she doesn't know the first thing about vampires and has even said herself that she's never seen a vampire movie and thinks that they are creepy.

I don't see what the big deal was and I know, here comes all the thumbs down from the Stephenie Meyer fans..oh well. <br>  <br>  I doubt she'll even do the research that needs to be done for the Rory Emerald biography. <br>  <br>  Just about everyone who read her books have read them quickly. This says something for Meyer's writing skill, or lack thereof. it's hard to believe the woman actually majored in English because she didn't seem to learn what "research," "editing," and "canon" mean.<br>  <br>  Come on now, how can you put out four quality books in one year?

Regardless whether you are Christian, Buddhist, etc... one of the largest concerns of a religion is addressing what happens after you die. Through 5,000 years of written history, we can see that civilizations and society feel the need to address the "what happens after you die?" question.  People generally feel the need to know that they matter, that they do not just 'extinguish' after death.  Regardless of belief, from the afterlife to incarnation, the issue addressed is always the fact that people do not actually die.  This is one of the reasons that so many cling to a religion.  After all, who wants to think that death is the final step?|`|1wxi3Aq1aa	I don`t understand that if it all you were someone else in the earlier life how does it affect us in the next life.<br>  If I say I am same as someone else it doesn`t have any meaning.<br>  There is no scientific evidence to prove this, anyway|`|aOy01jFEaa	Although some beliefs that relates to 'reincarnations' are carried from ancestral stages.

I think it plays an important part to their culture.<br>  Some from old folklores..<br>  Others' from the teachings that came from their respective religions..Like Buddhism & other more religions.<br>  When also some other's by paranormal configurations and strange theories that tries to convince the concept about 'reincarnations'..<br>  <br>  Spiritual people may believe in the spirit realm, that makes them think that the spirit itself lives eternally..<br>  So as possibly as that reincarnations can exist in our world.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	You're laboring under a typical misconception about Reincarnationists. Most of us have memories of rather obscure past lives which are interesting only to ourselves and a few of our friends. <br>  <br>  Carl Sagan, who was a brilliant scientist and a tirelessly outspoken critic of the paranormal, allowed that reincarnation "might be true," a conclusion he drew after considering the apparent evidence on the subject. In his book "Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark," Sagan wrote: "At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study: ... (3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any way other than reincarnation. I pick these claims  ... as examples of contentions that might be true." (page 300)

You loved her and you still do and that is OK.  Being over it, is a question of how often you feel that way.  I have seen people who never cried when a loved one died start crying years later after a smell triggered their memory about their loved one.  Different things in life bring back tear full memories and crying may be your response to them.  You are who you are and if it is not effecting your life then that is OK, cry when you have to.  Some people love to have stuff around them to remind them of loved ones and others need to throw every thing away to stop the memories coming back. Every one is different if you are ok with it then it is not a problem.  On the other hand, if it is effecting your life seek help from a counselor.|`|0T769lIuaa	you never get "over" a death, never.<br>  <br>  it can become less painfull for you to think about...but thats it. its always going to hurt you to think about it, and the best thing you can do is to try and remeber the good things about her and the good times and how much youve grown from the situation, and how proud she would be if she were still here. i think life would be pretty bland if we couldnt think back and not have feelings about our lost loved ones.  best of luck :]

5b2cd89e5940076781e52d9c63b944d1aa	For example, the "golden rule" that defines the proportion of length vs height. Now you have to know that in the classical period (whatever that is) there were strict hierarchies between artists: (those who did) historical or biblical subjects; portraits; everyday scenes (Vermeer etc.) and at the bottom of the scale landscapes.<br>  Another convention was to paint a portrait of the sponsors (donators) in the background. Finally the use of colours has a special meaning, for ex. much gold means a very rich donator, etc.<br>  I hope this answers your question.
XoNuUrYoaa	The purpose of Amish clothing is to be plain, to conform to biblical standards of modesty and to be practical.It is a 1500 peasant dress with prayer coverings.<br>  <br>  Edwardian dress was not based on religion nor practical nor plain, but in fact the very opposite: fashionable and impractical with corsets.It with worn with hats or bareheaded.<br>  <br>  Amish dress: <br>  <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0921/csmimg/LFORGIVENESS_P3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0921/csmim...</a> , <br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7yyudy0PTo4/SQYrzQ6n0kI/AAAAAAAAFJE/lzCPq4z8RmU/s320/Amish-women2-kp.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7yyudy0PTo4/SQ...</a> ,  <br>  <a href="http://pro.corbis.com/images/WL005335.jpg?size=67&uid={D0FB4EED-4A0A-4637-9683-C2B2BD8C3CF1}" rel="nofollow">http://pro.corbis.com/images/WL005335.jp...</a> ,  <a href="http://blogs.newamericamedia.org/images/263.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.newamericamedia.org/images/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Edwardian dress: <br>  <a href="http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/3295017.jpg?v=1&c=ViewImages&k=2&d=C06051C8BA2A5A2C8BBBE564F555E878A55A1E4F32AD3138" rel="nofollow">http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/3295017....</a> ,  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2155/2502468342_f5fe23996a.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2155/2502...</a> ,  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KNCtojYB9JU/SJMhWlInYvI/AAAAAAAABkc/Q29JETU5Bic/s400/vicbl3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KNCtojYB9JU/SJ...</a> ,  <a href="http://www.koshka-the-cat.com/ed_corset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.koshka-the-cat.com/ed_corset....</a>|`|DQAIzftdaa	No. Clothing of the Edwardian era was elaborate, ruffled, beribboned, sequinned, spangled, and laced. Plus, women wore corsets, chemises, drawers, hip bustles, garters, and stockings beneath their boned bodices and horsehair-hemmed fluted, floor-length skirts. Definitely different from Amish clothing, which is all about modesty.|`|AA12095483	No way. Not even close. The Amish wear plain clothing. The men wear black suits with no lapels or buttons. Edwardians word plainer clothing than the previous era, but certainly nothing as plain as the Amish. <br>  As for the women - there is no way an Amish woman would ever wear some of the Edwardian women's clothing. It was all laces and buttons and bows.|`|oTSB5BITaa	Not in anyway whatsoever. The Amish dress, for women and men, is meant to be plain, modest and display humbleness. Edwardian era clothing was extravagant.
LEp7IFdvaa	I'd suggest you start with the story just before they go up in the tree, how he felt about Finny before, what he did, and how he felt later about himself and Finny.  I'd also recommend you use only about 4 or 5 stanzas and try to capture the essence of his coming of age and maturity, his ultimate maturing into a person who can forgive himself of the errors in his youth, understand his fallibility and imperfections, as well as those of his friend, Finny.<br>  <br>  The poem does not have to rhyme, just try to create images that show what went on, not tell us what happened.  Something like, "Finny wasn't the only one who fell from the limb, innocence went tumbling down, never to be the same".
AA11231339	Law of Attraction says if you really believe it and you are truly aligned with it, then yes, anything is possible.<br>  <br>  Someone asked once "Then why don't people grow back limbs?"  And the answer was "They don't believe they can."<br>  <br>  But then there are rules here in our world.  Like gravity.  So perhaps the person who dreamed they could fly ended up inventing the hang glider and they felt their goal was achieved, even if they didn't sprout wings.<br>  <br>  One of the most important questions with Law of Attraction is "why". Why do you want mutant powers?<br>  <br>  If you then focus on the "why" you want them you will be able to manifest those results in ways both you and Earth believe are possible.  So you may not end up with mutant powers but you'll be deliriously happy, which is, perhaps, the point.<br>  <br>  When people used to ask that question "If you could have one super power what would it be? I'd always pick teleportation.  Lunch in France.  Dinner in Rome.  What fun!  But then the idea of becoming a scientific test subject always ruined it for me.  I decided flying would be much easier in the long run.  :)|`|EPe2p55Eaa	i dun have a ego but doggies give it 2 me which makes me why so so so powerful today. am i sure? or not? imao.|`|oylb7RNBaa	Well, since you really are a banana with sunglasses, I don't see what isn't mutated.

The lines then are just the letters in between in alphabetical order.<br>  <br>  For the right hand (treble cleff), you also have five lines and four spaces.

piHVQmXdaa	No, no, no. Don't just combine your sequel with your original because you want it to be longer. It will look like you've just added more story to fill blank pages, and not because its necessary to have it there. Publishers are more likely to choose a good, shorter novel over a longer novel that looks as though its been thrown together. Besides, publishers generally prefer novels from first time writers to be shorter.<br>  <br>  My biggest piece of advice for making it longer would be to go back and read it again, checking if it needs more detail. Sometimes in our rush to write we forget to add the smaller details that make novels unforgettable, and if your novel is too short, maybe its because you've left out details. Don't add unnecessary detail, because once again it will just look like a page filler. Only add more if it will improve your novel.<br>  <br>  Where did you get there idea that you need 68,672 words? How many do you have written now?|`|fkwYvFBRaa	Publishers sometimes require an average page count of 48 pages the least for black and white books. If you think you can do that, why not?|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Actually, a novel is considered any book that is at least 20 pages. Don't combine the original with the sequel, or the story will seem too long, thrown together, and it might ruin the story.|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	Why would this matter? You write it however long it needs to be, by the way I read a wonderful classic novel that was only about 120 pages.............. so I don't think length is too important so long as it's more than 100 pages your fine, 100 may be pushing it, but I'm sure 180 is perfect, 300 is nice and anything above 300 is automatically a novel, lol.

OHfZFR31aa	Modeling and acting are completely different. You can't get any legitimate acting agent if you don't have experience. You need to get as much experience as you can before you even try to get an agent - school plays, community theater, company productions at a theater school, student films, etc, etc. If you can't prove that you can get a role in an amateur production, you'll never stand a chance in a professional audition. I have a friend who has even done 2 off-Broadway plays in NY and was mentioned in newspaper reviews and she can't even get an agent yet because they all say she needs more experience<br>  <br>  For modeling, if you are at least 5'8" with measurements around 34-24-34 you send pictures directly to agencies like Ford, Elite, IMG, Women, Wilhelmina, DNA, Next, 1 Model Management, MC2, Marilyn, etc and they call you if they think you have the right look.

You've been far too generous. Twilight is easily the most over-rated book series of recent times. I feel that most of this is due to the fact that her target audience is full of emerging readers. Of course the less immature of this group are going to consider it the best book "evah" as there are very few books on the adult shelves at the library that they are able to fully read and understand at this stage.<br>  <br>  Their opinion on what makes a good book will change as they get older.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Yes, thank you! It's so irritating that so many people love Twilight. Stephanie Meyer's writing is so mediocre. I tried to read the first book, but I couldn't stand it. Stephen King criticized her writing, and all of her fans got angry and said the Stephen-freaking-King didn't know what he was talking about and that he was the bad novelist. Can you believe that?

shVgCizBaa	Although it has been said that Queen Elizabeth had lots of different lovers, in fact she only ever had one love-affair. This was with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who she may well have married had the political circumstances been more favourable to the match. Stories of relationships with men like Christopher Hatton, Water Raleigh,  and The Earl of Essex, are false. <a href="http://www.elizabethi.org/uk/myths/myth11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.elizabethi.org/uk/myths/myth1...</a>    Elizabeth's Lovers <br>  Queen Elizabeth I's lovers included Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_were_Queen_Elizabeth_I's_lovers" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_were_Queen...</a><br>   but the country had been so much alarmed at their narrow escape, that Parliament ventured once more to address the queen on the subject of her marriage. They begged that she would either consent to that measure, or, if she was finally determined not to do that, that she [168] would cause a law to be passed, or an edict to be promulgated, deciding beforehand who was really to succeed to the throne in the event of her decease. <br>  <br>  Elizabeth would not do either. Historians have speculated a great deal upon her motives; all that is certain is the fact, she would not do either. <br>  <br>  But, though Elizabeth thus resisted all the plans formed for giving her a husband, she had, in her own court, a famous personal favorite, who has always been considered as in some sense her lover. His name was originally Robert Dudley, though she made him Earl of Leicester, and he is commonly designated in history by this latter name. He was a son of the Duke of Northumberland, who was the leader of the plot for placing Lady Jane Grey upon the throne in the time of Mary. He was a very elegant and accomplished man, and young, though already married. Elizabeth advanced him to high offices and honors very early in her reign, and kept him much at court. She made him her Master of Horse, but she did not bestow upon him much real power. Cecil  was her great counselor and minister of state. He was a cool, sagacious, wary man, entirely [171] devoted to Elizabeth's interests, and to the glory and prosperity of the realm. He was at this time, as has already been stated, forty years of age, thirteen or fourteen years older than Elizabeth. Elizabeth showed great sagacity in selecting such a minister, and great wisdom in keeping him in power so long. He remained in her service all his life, and died at last, only a few years before Elizabeth, when he was nearly eighty years of age.   <br>  <br>  PORTRAIT OF THE EARL OF LEICESTER.   <br>  Dudley, on the other hand, was just about Elizabeth's own age. In fact, it is said by some of the chronicles of the times that he was born on the same day and hour with her. However this may be, he became a great personal favorite, and Elizabeth evinced a degree and kind of attachment to him which subjected her to a great deal of censure and reproach. <br>  <br>  She could not be thinking of him for her husband, it would seem, for he was already married. Just about this time, however, a mysterious circumstance occurred, which produced a great deal of excitement, and has ever since marked a very important era in the history of Leicester and Elizabeth's attachment. It was the sudden and very singular death of Leicester's wife. [172] Leicester had, among his other estates, a lonely mansion in Berkshire, about fifty miles west of London. It was called Cumnor House. Leicester's wife was sent there, no one knew why; she went under the charge of a gentleman who was one of Leicester's dependents, and entirely devoted to his will. The house, too, was occupied by a man who had the character of being ready for any deed which might be required of him by his master. The name of Leicester's wife was Amy Robesart. <br>  <br>  In a short time news came to London that the unhappy woman was killed by a fall down stairs! The instantaneous suspicion darted at once into every one's mind that she had been murdered. Rumors circulated all around the place where the death had occurred that she had been murdered. A conscientious clergyman of the neighborhood sent an account of the case to London, to the queen's ministers, stating the facts, and urging the queen to order an investigation of the affair, but nothing was ever done. It has accordingly been the general belief of mankind since that time, that the unprincipled courtier destroyed his wife in the vain hope of becoming afterward the husband of the queen. <br>  <br>  [173] The people of England were greatly incensed at this transaction. They had hated Leicester before, and they hated him now more inveterately still. Favorites are very generally hated; royal favorites always. He, however, grew more and more intimate with the queen, and every body feared that he was going to be her husband. Their conduct was watched very closely by all the great world, and, as is usual in such cases, a thousand circumstances and occurrences were reported busily from tongue to tongue, which the actors in them doubtless supposed passe|`|XJWeuLPoaa	those were the only ones <br>  history considers robert dudley for many reasons but nothing is proven

REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent.

So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s.

It merely feels good, and nothing more. <br>  Therefore, if you accept the assertion that self-indulgence is essentially masturbation of one form or another, then a life of self-indulgence is the same as a life of masturbation, and therefore meaningless, which is the opposite of meaningful.<br>  Maybe this is why a person who leads a life of self-indulgence would be called a "wanker" and not a person of substance.|`|4UV5423Qaa	dont wanna seem like a jerk here but, yes. so, basically, it is sound to believe that life on this planet has reached a point of no return. we failed. its over. all this will be definitely gone in 500 years or less. i didnt say this, they asked the top ten smartest minds including Stephen Hawking and he wasnt very optimistic. so, that being said, if i were born 500 years ago, i woulda answered no. but since its NEAR the end of the world, MOTHEREFFING PARTY!

TbTO5SXlaa	To be truly successful at night photography you'll need a tripod and a cable release. Without a tripod your pictures will be a blurred mess and useless.

As far as I know, there was never any such thing as "ASO."<br>  <br>  The ISO rating of a film means how light sensitive the film is.  A higher ISO film is more sensitive than a lower ISO film.  Thus, 400 ISO film would be more light sensitive than 200 ISO film.<br>  <br>  I normally prefer to use lower ISO films, like 100 or 200 because they give better quality pictures.  400 ISO film is more sensitive and can be used in lower light, but the pictures also tend to be more grainy.<br>  <br>  The f-stop and shutter speed you will need to use will depend on the lighting conditions.  If you're taking pictures at night without a flash, you will have to use a long exposure.  So you'll have to mount the camera on a tripod and you should also use a shutter release cable.  The camera has to be as steady as possible, otherwise your pictures will be blurry.<br>  <br>  The other thing you need to remember is that the F-stop also determines the depth of field.  The depth of field means the distance in front and behind the subject that will be in focus.  A smaller aperture will have a long depth of field, and the background will be sharp and in focus.  A wider aperture will have a more shallow depth of field, and the<br>  foreground will be sharp but the background will start to look soft and out of focus.  If you're taking pictures of a street, then you'll probably want to keep the background sharp and in focus, which means that you would need to use a small aperture, like f/11 or f/16.<br>  <br>  Everyone seems to be suggesting that you use a wide aperture, but I don't understand why...you will have a very shallow depth of field if you do that.  That might work with some subjects, but you'll have to decide how much of your picture you need to be in focus.<br>  <br>  If you're taking pictures of a street at night, with typical lighting from street lamps and with 400 ISO film, then I would recommend setting your aperture at f/11 and do a 6 second exposure.  That means put your shutter speed on the "B" (Bulb) setting, which will leave the shutter open for as long as you hold down the button.  Use a shutter release cable, so you don't even have to touch the camera.  That will keep the camera steady.  You don't want to bump or move the camera when you do the exposure, or your picture will be blurry.<br>  <br>  Also, bracket your pictures.  Try different exposure times.<br>  <br>  By the way...is there some reason why you never chose a Best Answer on your other question about this?  I hope you're actually reading these answers, and we aren't all wasting our time.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	It's hard to answer the question correctly because it all depends on how dark or bright the subject is at night. If you're trying to take pictures of skylines you can maybe try your widest aperture and a shutter speed around 1/60 or so. You're going to have to experiment till you find your own little formula<br>  <br>  Below is a list of links for night time photography|`|j0gtbpS1aa	With asa 400 film, you will need a f/stop that lets in as much light as possible, (lower number) and a slow shutter speed to allow more light to enter.  you will have to experiment- try a staring point of 1/60 for sshutter speed, f/4 for aperture  and if you can get some get some iso 1600 film that is for use inlow light situations.|`|WJLl0d3Jaa	Open up that aperture and experiment. Make sure to bring a tripod, it'll come in handy.<br>  <br>  To the poster that said:<br>  <br>  "Crank up iso. and Maximum aperture (low f number)"<br>  <br>  Please explain how you would crank up ISO on a film camera when they're using 400 ISO film.|`|aRIA86D8aa	The answers above are very good. In addition, because you're using film you need to use different f-stops, say 4, 5.6, 8 for one subject, it's called bracketing. Keep in mind that because you don't have a flash the exposure time will have to be longer - you'll need a tripod most likely. Good luck and have fun!|`|1b8gW3Dfaa	Crank up iso. and Maximum aperture (low f number)
9c6QbEbBaa	The Renaissance artists primarily focused on recreating the Classical ideal in their work, meaning they tried to copy the Greeks and Romans in style. In Classical Greece, the nude male form was perfect, however the penis was the least important part of the form, while muscle mass and body and facial proportion were much more influential over a man's perfection. In the Renaissance, theoretically it could have been kept small for modesty purposes, as most of the art of the period was commissioned by the church, and Michelangelo particularly worked closely (though not often by choice) with Pope Julius II. You might notice different disproportion within this statue, such as the oversized hands, which are more interesting than the small penis. Michelangelo wanted to put some of himself into this work, so he put in his large hands.|`|zHmZkMStaa	The statue actually has a normal sized penis, in the flaccid state.  Athletes in the nude, outdoors, usually had flaccid penis's due to exposure to the elements that often cause the penis to retract somewhat into the warmer interior of the body.|`|8d11c37d4955e1384f12ac257ab78b1aaa	His penis is not erect. Perhaps the model was a grower, not a shower.|`|0dg9JtfNaa	maybe he didn't want to draw much attention to the penis.

MXoBrPcMaa	Morganville Vampires by Rachel Caine - It's not super sappy and it's not exactly gothic-y either by I love the books. Right now there's five but I think it's going to go up to seven, if not more.<br>  <br>  Tithe by Holly Black - More of the gothic feel and romanticness. The second book has nothing to do with anything in the first, but the third reverts to the original characters.<br>  <br>  House of Night by P.C. Cast - Also not very gothic-y but it's fun to read and the narrator is very sarcastic and witty. The romace is scattered though and often irritating.<br>  <br>  Wicked Lovely by Melissa Marr - Gothic-y feel with undertones of romance. Like the Tithe series, the second book doesn't follow along with the same plot, though it still involved characters from the first one and follows along with the original main characters in the third one which comes out late April. <br>  <br>  Evernight by Claudia Gray - Vampires, pretty much the same story, with a twist. Not exactly what I'd call gothic-y but it's got good light-hearted romance. It's early in the series, though. There's only one out, but I think the second one comes out this month, on the 24th.<br>  <br>  These are the only gothic-y non-sappy series on my bookshelf. I also have romance that aren't exactly gothic-y but are still fantastic.

wKKxUNzyaa	Hi,<br>  My best answer for this is:<br>  - If you have read the book; you may like to see what became of it. Despite some poor special effects etc. It was quite a laugh and I enjoyed watching it. Sure it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it was pretty good compared with some of the others I have seen. It is worth a look. I was only curious to see what one of my favorite novels had become. Sure I was slightly disappointed but then again no movie made from a novel is perfect so you can't expect word for word accuracy. But it was quite enjoyable.<br>  - If you haven't the read the book; there really isn't much for you to miss. The movie is well planned and narrated so you get the general idea of the movie extremely quickly. Plus if you haven't read the book you won't know about the parts they cut out. So it'll be more exciting anyway. <br>  But either way its up to you. Despite the people who say it isn't worth it and the people who say its worth it; ultimately its up to you to make the decision.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|Xc16MR5Jaa	Don't go and see it if you really like the books. The movie changes so much around and the books are way better. I saw the movie, it was kind of disappointing.|`|PjlF0NJzaa	well it depends<br>  if u have read the book then you would find that they have left a lot out<br>  if u havent then you might enjoy it but i warn you now it may not be the best movie you have ever seen|`|CTVMCwyWaa	YESSSSSSSSS!! <br>  I RECOMMEND U SHOULD!

Soon the discussion would once again evolve into an argument with the main character having a big seen, running out of the house, and finding herself or reason for this in the night. After that, she come back to the house in the morning, family waiting for her, after that, you decide on how it should go, based on the story line and plot.<br>  Hoped I helped some.

35GfsJ3Paa	This is most certainly a personal thing for everyone, bit here are a few tips:<br>  <br>  1. If you have a very bright sound, an all metal ligature will probably make you sound more bright. On the other hand, if your tone needs a bit more focus, a metal-cloth combo - like the Rovner - will work. <br>  <br>  2. The Vandoren Optimum is very popular, but the three plates tend to indent the reeds, so then you can't adjust the reed without it warping.<br>  <br>  3. I like the Bonade inverted ligature - it's about $15 for the silver plated one (don't bother with gold).<br>  <br>  4. The number one rule with ligatures is....try a bunch!! Most online woodwind companies will let you "buy" 5 or 6 and return the ones you don't want.<br>  <br>  Here's a good list to try:<br>  BG L2 (silver)<br>  Bonade regular (silver)<br>  Bonade inverted (silver)<br>  Vandoren optimum<br>  Rovner<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's mostly a choice of personal taste. I have a friend who plays with a shoestring for a ligature (and she is a clarinet performance major)!<br>  <br>  By the way, if you're still playing with the mouthpiece that came with your clarinet, change that FIRST. It has a much bigger effect on your sound and playing, and the ligature you choose needs to fit with your mouthpiece. (Try Richard Hawkins, Vandoren B24, 5RV Lyre, M15, and McClune mouthpieces...same deal as with the ligatures. Order several, return the ones you don't want. With mouthpiece - check tuning carefully.)|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	yeahhh definitely drop the one that you got with your clarinet. <br>  i use a leather one by vandoren<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.muncywinds.com/image.php%3Fproductid%3D535&imgrefurl=http://www.muncywinds.com/product.php%3Fproductid%3D535&usg=__YCJcyqTW88hu0FHswOQJZ7ViR_c=&h=152&w=150&sz=11&hl=en&start=5&um=1&tbnid=476Nk7W670812M:&tbnh=96&tbnw=95&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dleather%2Bclarinet%2Bligature%2Bvandoren%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4GFRE_enUS317US317%26sa%3DN%26um%3D1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  it looks like that one.<br>  it's really good and i really like it.|`|9iElNpSSaa	I agree with Eldorado.  The Optimum is an excellent ligature.  It holds the reed securely on the mouthpiece and allows the reed to vibrate well to produce a good, full tone.<br>  If it’s too expensive, the Bonade ligature is also worth trying.|`|draNVjbkaa	I really like the Vandoren Optimum. You can change the sound with three different plates that the reed rests against. <br>  <br>  Also, those Rico Grand Concert ligatures are a good alternative if the Vandoren is too expensive for you. It has an "H" base plate and is very similar to the once popular and defunct Harrison ligature.<br>  <br>  I really hate those cloth ligature in that they dampen your sound. The only exception are those ones like the Eddie Daniels or BG that have those plates that the reed rests against.|`|gM03eKTJaa	The one that sounds best!<br>  That's a rather personal question since everyone has their own individual preference. I personally play a fabric Rovner, some people like it, some people don't. I don't like the silver BG lig but the guy next to me in band loves it. You really have to go out and try as many as possible, then pick out the one that gives the best sound and articulation. You might also want to compare how easy/user-friendly it is. If you are playing with the stock lig though, there are probably a lot of better ligatures out there that won't restrict the the reed or dampen the sound like the cheap, nickel ones. The only way to find out is to try them all.
AA10729675	Knowing the pattern of the road and the traffic lights is helpful and it yields some power but it is not real, true power.<br>  I think that the real, true power, for human beings is in his/her courage.  His/her guts, heart, nerves.<br>  Otherwise the true power belongs to God.|`|AA11458484	I've heard it said that wisdom is applied knowledge.  It is true that knowledge itself does not change anything.  A lot of times I will understand exactly why, say, I'm really sad or upset, but that knowledge (as hard as I often strive to obtain it) does not help.  It is only be knowing what "to do" that real change (or power) can be applied.  I do agree.|`|jsCfChszaa	your question is so problematic. do you imply that the knowledge before applied and the same knowledge after applied are different? If the former one is not real, how do you apply it and make the latter one real.  Thus if the latter is real, the former has to be real. But if both are real, why bother asking this question?
XE3PCLWNaa	I'm not sure where exactly it was set, but is mostly took place at the high school, Naomi's home, and through their town.<br>  <br>  The theme was probably "misdirection when it comes to young love/relationships.<br>  -I thought it was really cute, it wasn't just a traditional high school love story!<br>  <br>  I really liked Will, he was so out there and different.

Its a must read, I would recommend it above any other books)<br>  Bridge to Terabithia (sp?)- its since been made into a film.<br>  Tomorrow When the War Began by John Marsden|`|n03LF2Jaaa	My Secret Boyfriend by Lurlene McDaniel.<br>  <br>  Even though this book is not the typical "cryin' and dyin'" stuff Lurlene McDaniel's readers are used to, My Secret Boyfriend is still a great read. She has created characters that are like most teenagers--self-conscious and pressured to be like everyone else.

But otherwise, nice poem. Interesting concept.|`|xk0GAkSEaa	Brutal Honesty? Okay.<br>  <br>  It's a bit short, but not all poems have to be long. A poem should be a work of art capturing an idea, and then throttling that idea for all it's thought and purpose. It shouldn't be done in a short little period of time, that just makes them mediocre. In my eyes, your poem is not a work of art. It's not as good as it could be. Descriptive words, more clarity of the subject, and organization could make it much, much better. This subject is very arbitrary though, so you don't have to take my word for it.<br>  <br>  I just didn't like it at all, sorry.

We are a strong market for China, and trade helps to prevent war. We live in a globalized economy, which is one of the things that helps to keep war from happening---we're too inter-related to let it happen, and the consequences would be far too dire. Also, both China and the U.S. have nuclear weapons, which would be a no-win situation for both. No, the only war China would have with the U.S. would be to continue to put the U.S. into debt to pay for things it no longer makes itself, since America somehow convinced itself that it didn't need heavy industries anymore and that it could survive on a service economy based  on "brains" (even with a poor school system).

There are complications to the surgery though, and Tally has to figure out a way of saving the people she loves from the dangers of the World.<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride by James Patterson(Really good)*******<br>  A group of genetically enhanced kids who can fly and have other unique talents are on the run from part-human, part-wolf predators called Erasers in this exciting SF thriller that's not wholly original but is still a compelling read. Max, 14, and her adopted family–Fang and Iggy, both 13, Nudge, 11, Gazzy, 8, and Angel, 6–were all created as experiments in a lab called the School. Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist. Max's old childhood friend, Ari, now an Eraser leader, tracks them down, kidnaps Angel, and transports her back to the School to live like a lab rat again. The youngsters are forced to use their special talents to rescue her as they attempt to learn about their pasts and their destinies. <br>  <br>  Marked ( Book 1) House of Night series by P.C. Cast & Kristin Cast<br>  In 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres not only exist but are also tolerated by humans. Those whom the creatures "mark" as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception.<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series by Melissa De La Cruz- The Blue Blood Series by Melissa De La Cruz- About a group of Vampires called Blue Bloods who try to do good in the world, only to realize that one of their own has turned from them.<br>  <br>  Eternal By: Cynthia Smith-******<br>  At last, Miranda is the life of the party: all she had to do was die. Elevated and adopted by none other than the reigning King of the Mantle of Dracula, Miranda goes from high-school theater wannabe to glamorous royal fiend overnight. Meanwhile, her reckless and adoring guardian angel, Zachary, demoted to human guise as the princess’s personal assistant, has his work cut out for him trying to save his girl’s soul and plan the Master’s fast-approaching Death Day gala. <br>  <br>  Blood & Chocolate by Annette Curtis-<br>  Vivian is a teenage werewolf. When the moon is high, she feels the call to run wild in the woods, to feel the forest floor beneath her paws. But, when she moves into a new town, she meets a boy. A human. Her family disapproves but she is head over paws. With growing tension within her pack and her lack of control over her own abilities, she wonders if her boy will love her, or more importantly, if he will survive loving her. Jealously, isolation and competition within her extended family all threaten what tender happiness she tries to build.<br>  <br>  You can also check <a href="http://www.teenreads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenreads.com/</a> <br>  Hope that helps.))|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Some of my favorite classics are:<br>  <br>  - "Crime and Punishment" - Dostoyevsky<br>  - "For Whom the Bell Tolls" - Hemingway<br>  - "Lady Chatterley's Lover" - D.H.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	This is a great question, but it's way too broad.  Are you specifically looking for Polaroid cameras, or any kind of vintage cameras?<br>  <br>  If you are looking for Polaroid cameras, then yes the Polaroid 320 Land Camera is one good choice, because I've heard you can still get pack film for it fairly easily.  (Early Polaroid cameras used instant film, but it wasn't the same kind of integral catridge films that modern Polaroid cameras used.  I think it uses a "peel apart" type of film, which Fuji still makes).  <br>  <br>  Of course, Polaroid 600 cameras are ok too, if you just want a Polaroid camera to play around with.  For now, Polaroid 600 film is still available at places like Walmart, Target, and some camera shops...and of course, you can also buy it on Amazon and eBay.  In my opinion, I don't think you should bother with any more Polaroid Spectra cameras though.  Spectra is a bigger film than 600, and they're not compatible.  (600 film will not work in a Spectra camera, and vice versa).  Also, Spectra film is getting really hard to find and it's expensive.  I think Polaroid actually stopped making Spectra film a while back, so most of it is probably going to be expired by at least a year or two.<br>  <br>  If you're just looking for vintage cameras, then there are countless cameras you could get that use film that is easily available.  You can buy 35mm film pretty much anywhere...drug stores, grocery stores, camera shops, photography supply shops, and even some gas stations.  So you could get any 35mm camera.  I would recommend a camera with completely manual exposure control, like a vintage SLR or rangefinder camera.  Pretty much any of the Argus cameras are good, like the Argus C3, Argus C4, or Argus C-44.  You can find an Argus C3 in good condition for dirt cheap on eBay.  It's really old, and kind of heavy and boxy.  But it's actually a really good camera and it will take awesome pictures.  They're also very solid and reliable cameras.  I've bought a couple of them on eBay and I've seen a bunch of them in antique shops and thrift shops.  I have never seen an Argus C3 that wasn't working.  They're built like tanks.  <br>  <br>  If you want a vintage 35mm SLR, one camera I would recommend is a Minolta SR-1.  I have one, and I love it.<br>  <br>  If you want to use 120 film, then there are millions of cameras you can use.  You can get a TLR camera (Twin Lens Reflex) like a Yashica A or a Graflex 22.  Or you can get a folding camea like a Zeiss Ikon Nettar.  But there are countless other 120 cameras that you could get.  I could never list them here. 120 film is medium format, and for some reason, medium format cameras are really popular right now.  So they are starting to sell for higher prices.  If you buy one on eBay, plan to spend at least $50.  <br>  <br>  But really, you have millions of choices.  35mm and 120 size film is easily available, so pretty much any camera that uses 35mm or 120 film would be fine.  (127 and 626 film is available too, but it's a little harder to find and more expensive.)  Some cameras are better quality than others, but there are millions of vintage film cameras available.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Any 35mm or 120 film cameras you can easily get film for. You can also get a camera that takes 127 film, 4x5 or 8x10 sheet film. The latter group you will have to buy online most likely but you can get pretty easily. Most camera stores will carry 35mm and 120 film. Most drugstores, grocery stores, and Wal-Mart will have 35mm film.|`|KNN4a8uYaa	The Land Camera 320 still has film available for it - it uses the Pack Film that FujiFilm supports, called FP-100C.  You'll need to find a battery for the 320, but aside from that, you should be able to use the LandCamera 320.  The Spectra and Impulse are going to be a bit more hard to find unless the Impossible Project succeeds and brings the integral films back.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Most film is still available through online sources like bhphoto.com or <a href="http://www.freestylephoto.biz/c40-Black-and-White-Film" rel="nofollow">http://www.freestylephoto.biz/c40-Black-...</a> - I order a lot of stuff from Freestyle Sales and have not had a problem yet.  The most common types of film is 127, 120 and 35mm.  127 is a fun format but getting very hard to find.  <br>  <br>  There were so many film cameras produced that it is hard to say what you might find.  I buy a lot of my cameras from thrift stores and find some excellent deals on real good cameras including Nikons.<br>  <br>  I have a bunch of point and shot 35mm's as well as a Holga 120 and a 4x5 view camera (takes film that is 4"x5" in size and is produced and shot as sheet film).|`|WJLl0d3Jaa	Check your local craigslist, people always sell their old film stuff there. You can test them out yourself too. There's tons of cameras out there that take 35mm. It's not going to be obsolete anytime soon...maybe some of the larger formats would be hard to find film for though.<br>  <br>  What's your budget like?

T85WCEltaa	I agree with James@hb - history can't be ignored just because it may be unpleasant, or have something to do with an insidious evil monster like Hitler.  Bad history still happened, and shouldn't be swept under the carpet.  <br>  <br>  What you do with the photograph now depends upon you - if you want to purely gain money from your find, then by all means approach an auction house (probably preferable to putting it on eBay).  However, if you want to ensure that this significant historical artefact benefits everyone (and isn't lost in some private collection, or bought by somebody so that it can be destroyed or exploited) then donate it to a Museum/Library/Archives that specialises in wartime history - that way your grandfather's memory will also live on in posterity (as the owner) - as will your name, as the donor.  Who knows, this could be an important find that should be available to historians, etc.  <br>  <br>  Alternately, you could keep it in your private possession, but allow institutions access to it (via reproduction).<br>  <br>  This photograph could tell the story of the US soldiers who 'liberated' Germany at the end of the war, as well as telling another part of Hitler's story.|`|AA11304025	You need to get it verified by a photographic expert.<br>  There were some very good propaganda photos produced of Hitler in various sexual acts but they are clever fakes.<br>  I have one in a book|`|vUpjOUQQaa	Who cares any more!|`|xnCizA7Daa	burn it|`|AA10731404	Just because we hate Hitler it doesn't mean we should destroy artifacts of his existence.

NxwTTbOqaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Generally, you can resort to a site like serials.ws to obtain serial keys. Obviously this isn't condoned by the software developers, however; if you had it on your computer previously, there is really no harm in getting a serial key this way.<br>  <br>  Try one of these:<br>  <br>  1045-0436-9551-0266-5984-9386 OR <br>  1045-1278-2655-8647-2459-1077 OR <br>  1045-1774-7722-2716-7121-5935 OR<br>  1045-1610-5406-5471-4021-2095 OR<br>  1045-1242-8943-9366-9867-5690 OR<br>  1045-1777-3606-7977-0913-5142.<br>  <br>  There's no chance of getting in trouble or anything, but my guess is you probably won't be able to receive any updates.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	get the disk that you installed on the old computer and reinstall on the new computer, it will have its serial number on it...i certainly won't give you the serial number off MY cs2 because it is licensed to me and i don't want to void my photo shop.|`|AA12339318	I have a serial number that I paid several hundred dollars for, and you want me to just GIVE it to you, for free?<br>  <br>  I think not.|`|nbNerXGuaa	Did you download it off limewire or from the actual disc ?|`|kr34vLJkaa	Contact Adobe and tell them your dilema.
yvyewZrWaa	As someone else said, "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens revolves around the pursuit for money -- or at least the pursuit of importance in a very stratified society built upon money -- and corruption/unhappiness as a side-effect of this pursuit.<br>  Dickens also used this theme in "Our Mutual Friend" and "Little Dorrit" to a lesser extent. <br>  "Silas Marner" by George Eliot has a similar theme, showing the false happiness a miser's gold might bring him, compared to the true happiness of love.|`|VvMquavyaa	"Voices From the Street" by Philip K Dick has an underlying theme that is kind of similar. :)|`|WpFfvYL5aa	uhh Great Expectations. Maybe. I didn't really read the book, but i think thats a central theme.

2I2t0xWdaa	wow. honestly...i think your poem is really impressive. its really good! i think your girlfriend would really appreciate this :)|`|xk0GAkSEaa	It's not bad, but to be completely honest, as a reader and poet, I find your lines a bit contradictory. Your connections are a bit skewed too. Love is weak but we find it sweet. That means that the weakness of love has led us to believe that love is bitter, or something that isn't sweet.<br>  The organization is a bit strange too, but I guess this wasn't meant to be super serious. It's okay.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm 13 too.|`|N3Q6p2Kgaa	I think its really great.... especially considering you are only 13!!!  <br>  But not sure about the ending, Also not sure if it sends a lovey dovey message to your girlfriend.

AA10731404	You probably won't like this answer, but it is the truth.  The first "American slaves" (meaning those in the English colonies) were Scots captured in battle by the British.  But, because they were not able to endure the Virginia climate and died off quickly, the Virginians began to believe that they should start using Africans like the Spanish were doing in the Caribbean.  Portuguese slave traders brought the first African slaves to Virginia.<br>  <br>  Slavery was widespread in the Colonies with many different people enslaved.  The American Revolution effectively ended slavery in what became the United States for all except the Africans.  For a good picture of African slavery try Steven Spielberg's move "Amistad."  It gruesome but realistic.|`|5bzJUmh4aa	It started with the Spanish.  St. Augustine, Florida, was the first European settlement in what is now the United States.  The Spanish began importing slaves there in the 1500s.  The first British colony was Jamestown, in Virginia.  The first African slaves arrived in Jamestown in 1619.  The Pilgrims owned slaves too.  In fact, slavery was legal in all 13 original colonies.  Many Northern states abolished slavery soon after the American Revolution.  Slavery was finally abolished in the US in 1865 by the 13th Amendment.  Who was involved?  Many tens of thousands of people who imported, bought and owned slaves.  And of course, many millions of Africans and their descendants!
YEfW3vI0aa	He is just trying to make himself the hero and kill Hary first instead of Voldemort.<br>  But Voldemort doesn't want this because he wants the pride of killing Harry.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I don't think he does. He's just being a wimp and hanging out as a rat. He decided that being a pet is more cushy than being a street rat and it's just coincidence that he's Ron's rat and has the opportunity to be close to Harry.<br>  I'm sure he also thinks that if the Dark Lord is still around somewhere as the rumors claim he is, then Wormtail can use what he's learnt at a later date to help him get back in favour with the Dark Lord.<br>  <br>  Deep down, Wormtail is just a coward and I don't think he could actually kill Harry himself.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	He's trying to get in Voldemort's favor. He's always been a coward and hung out with those he'd be protected by. First, it was the rest of the Marauders- James, Sirius, and Lupin- and then, it was Voldemort when he was rising in power. Voldemort is obviously very dangerous and Pettigrew has no backbone, so he sticks with Voldemort. He wants Harry dead because Voldemort wants Harry dead. If Harry dies, Voldemort will be happy, and good things will happen to Pettigrew.|`|fP9UBlD1aa	Well, I'm not entirely sure he wants him dead.  I mean, he pretends to be a rat for years and years, even after he knows Harry is there.  After he feels threatened and tries to escape, it isn't like he tries to take Harry with him or anything like that.  I suppose the only reason he would want Harry dead or to be able to capture Harry is to make Voldemort happy.  I think he is more concerned about himself than Harry really, and if he has to use Harry for his means he will, unfortunately.|`|o1BDgJQTaa	Nothing personal. He is just trying to curry favour with Voldy.

YEfW3vI0aa	Here are some I found and like:<br>  <br>  <br>  Albert Einstein: <br>  Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Albert Einstein: <br>  How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Albert Schweitzer: <br>  Thought cannot avoid the ethical or reverence and love for all life. It will abandon the old confined systems of ethics and be forced to recognize the ethics that knows no bounds. But on the other hand, those who believe in love for all creation must realize clearly the difficulties involved in the problem of a boundless ethic and must be resolved not to veil from [humankind] the conflicts which this ethic will involve [us], but allow [us] really to experience them. To think out in every implication the ethic of love for all creation -- this is the difficult task which confronts our age.a€? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Alfred Adler: <br>  We only regard those unions as real examples of love and real marriages in which a fixed and unalterable decision has been taken. If men or women contemplate an escape, they do not collect all their powers for the task. In none of the serious and important tasks of life do we arrange such a "getaway." We cannot love and be limited.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Alfred Tennyson: <br>  I hold it true, whate'er befall; <br>  I feel it, when I sorrow most; <br>  'Tis better to have loved and lost <br>  Than never to have loved at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Allan K. Chalmers: <br>  The Grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ambrose Bierce: <br>  Love: a temporary insanity, curable by marriage.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Amy Bloom: <br>  Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Amy Tan: <br>  I am like a falling star who has finally found her place next to another in a lovely constellation, where we will sparkle in the heavens forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anais Nin: <br>  Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ann Landers: <br>  If you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things you lack. If you don't have it, no matter what else there is, it's not enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anne Morrow Lindbergh: <br>  Him that I love, I wish to be free -- even from me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Antoine de Saint-Exupery: <br>  Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Arthur Rubinstein: <br>  Love life and life will love you back. Love people and they will love you back.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Barbara De Angelis: <br>  Love is a choice you make from moment to moment.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Barbara De Angelis: <br>  Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bayard Rustin: <br>  When I say I love Eastland, it sounds preposterous -- a man who brutalizes people. But you love him or you wouldn't be here. You're going to Mississippi to create social change -- and you love Eastland in your desire to create conditions which will redeem his children. Loving your enemy is manifest in putting your arms not around the man but around the social situation, to take power from those who misuse it -- at which point they can become human too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bayard Taylor: <br>  I love thee, I love but thee<br>  With a love that shall not die<br>  Till the sun grows cold,<br>  And the stars grow old...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bertrand Russell: <br>  The good life is inspired by love and guided by knowledge.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bertrand Russell: <br>  Three passions have governed my life: <br>  The longings for love, the search for knowledge, <br>  And unbearable pity for the suffering of [humankind]. <br>  <br>  Love brings ecstasy and relieves loneliness. <br>  In the union of love I have seen <br>  In a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision <br>  Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined. <br>  <br>  With equal passion I have sought knowledge. <br>  I have wished to understand the hearts of [people]. <br>  I have wished to know why the stars shine. <br>  <br>  Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens, <br>  But always pity brought me back to earth; <br>  Cries of pain reverberated in my heart <br>  Of children in famine, of victims tortured <br>  And of old people left helpless. <br>  I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, <br>  And I too suffer. <br>  <br>  This has been my life; I found it worth living. <br>  <br>  adapted<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bertrand Russell: <br>  A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bible: <br>  Love is patient, love is kind.<br>  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.<br>  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking.<br>  It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.<br>  Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.<br>  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br>  Love never fails.<br>  I Cori

d4Uz4FqZaa	Yeah. I have heard the rumor about the book will be made into 12 series. I think it will be divided into 2 types namely the protectors and the fugitives. Like the fourth book, it's the protector one. Probably he will inform the readers about the danger which may happen to our earth like fourth book. And I think the fifth one will be the same because it had been rumored that the content will be about dying fish. But I hope that the book will be like the fugitives one because I really like to read the book without any other stuff like saving the world things though I don't mind James Patterson to write about it.<br>  About your additional details, I don't know what would happen. Probably Jeb will die or Fang would die. Maybe Fang will live happily ever after with Brigid, not Max. We don't know about the upcoming books except James Patterson himself. Like in The Lake House (Another book of James Patterson), Oz died. Probably it would end the same like in Maximum Ride though we have never wanted it will happen.|`|Mt1b8dKsaa	Ah! I love you! Sorry, it's rare that I've seen a Maximum Ride Q on here. XD Anyway, I've heard that rumor too, about the series having 12 books. I'm not sure if it's true yet or not. All I know right now is that the 5th book is coming out the sixteenth of March, lol!<br>  But I don't know what else he could fit into the series to have it be TWELVE books long. I mean, I guess saving the world would take a while... but... you know. XD I just hope we get a lot of action and suspense in the following books. It'd also make me happy if Fang and Max got together.....<br>  ;)|`|rt30mwXbaa	YES!!!!  12 MORE BOOKS!!!!  I absolutely cannot say how awesome that is!  I don't know what will be in the series past #4, but it will be something great!  YAYYYYYY!!!!

LVZdzPmpaa	It would be a tie, with each and every one of them dead as a direct result of their respective alcoholism.<br>  <br>  And you forgot Faulkner.<br>  <br>  Capote was 59 when he died. His death is attributed to a combination of depression, alcoholism and drugs. He was self-medicating owing to the painful experience (guilt) of "In Cold Blood" as well as a social faux pas that cast him out of the circle and the limelight he craved. Capote was not the lifelong, hard core drunk that like those you list in your post.|`|AZ6Z0pXJaa	I'd say Kerouac.

Derek Dillon Darrow <br>  derek can mean 'power of the tribe' or 'famous ruler,' both of which i think fit since the weapon is destined for infamy and can prove powerful to wherever he is loyal. Dillon means loyal. i could probably be wrong, but i think of your character number 5 as more attatched and passionate than number one. darrow means spear, but i just liked the sound of it.

ORbFRn4oaa	Please define "All-Virtuous"?<br>  <br>  Also What is the relation of pain to being virtuous ??<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Another set of questions to ask is:<br>  <br>  1-  Are pain and happiness a created trait or they are universal.<br>  <br>  If they are created feelings by God, then we cannot apply these rules to God himself i.e. He sets the rules for the creation. He is above the rules i.e. laws of Physics, Chemistry, biology, astronomy, Time and space are all created by Him. They do NOT apply to Him. You cannot back engineer on these rules to extrapolate to God. <br>  <br>  He may set an ENTIRELY different Physics, Chemistry, Time and Space for ANOTHER Universe.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  However from the Quran I can say the following:<br>  <br>  1-  God is Egoistic. He does NOT tolerate another being to have an authority in his kingdom.<br>  <br>  One may argue that Ego is a bad and against virtue. Then that means that God is NOT virtuous.<br>  <br>  Well !!!! , I think YES and NO !!<br>  <br>  Freewill, leads to arguments and differences, which leads to desire for control and which leads to jealousies and desire to rule.<br>  <br>  Now, I know, no matter how good I may be, if I get absolute power, I will really make the life of my subordinates MISERABLE.<br>  <br>  I would demand so much out of them i.e. personal praise, and service etc. etc.<br>  <br>  I may start as a very humble officer incharge. But it would ONLY be a matter of time i.e. may be 100 or 200 years that I would turn into a damn tyrant (if I remain unchecked).<br>  <br>  The very fact, that God tolerates ALL our disobedience and deviations and yet grants us long spans of time to learn the lessons. And also does NOT hasten in punishing. All these things point out that God is indeed very compassionate. Compassionate to a level which is NOT in the capacity of His creatures.<br>  <br>  Also He does NOT hasten punishing on just disobedience. He punishes when we transgress against others. If we are given our own dominions, we will most certainly transgress against each other. We can ALREADY see that happening in the world. The USA claims to be a democratic freedom loving country. Has it not dropped the two nukes in the name of peace.

Ma nel 479 avanti Cristo, i Greci, dopo la vittoria sulle truppe persiane di Serse nella battaglia di Platea, non avevano di questi problemi e decisero di consacrare un nuovo tempio a Zeus, padre di tutti gli dei, nella località di Olimpia. La costruzione, affidata all'architetto Libone, fu completata nel 456 a. C. Le dimensioni del tempio erano eccezionali: la base misurava 27,70 metri per 64,10, e le 34 colonne, del diametro di 2,25 metri ciascuna, erano alte 10,53 metri. Libone non scelse il marmo ma un materiale che si trovava in abbondanza sul luogo, un conglomerato di conchiglie fossili. I blocchi dell'architrave pesavano circa 12 tonnellate, e ci si domanda ancor oggi come sia stato possibile sollevarli fino alla sommità delle colonne. All'interno del perimetro tracciato dalle colonne si trovava la cella, di 13 metri per 28,75, al cui interno si suppone dovesse essere posta la statua di culto, senza la quale il tempio non poteva essere consacrato a Zeus. Da Atene venne convocato lo scultore più famoso dell'epoca, Fidia, che fu incaricato di creare la colossale immagine di Zeus, un "gioiello" in oro e avorio. Era tale il suo peso che, per sostenerla, le fondamenta della cella dovettero essere abbassate. La cella era alta 14 metri, la statua di Zeus 12 ed era posta su un piedistallo di 1,10 metri: la testa del dio quindi toccava quasi il soffitto a cassettoni lignei. La chioma, l'abito drappeggiato e i sandali erano ricoperti d'oro (anzi, questi ultimi e qualche ciocca dei capelli pare fossero in oro massiccio). E' stato calcolato che per il rivestimento di queste parti con una foglia aurea dallo spessore inferiore a un millimetro furono usati oltre mille chili d'oro. Il capo era ornato da una corona d'ulivo, simile al premio conferito ai vincitori olimpionici, che probabilmente era dipinta di verde. Le parti nude del corpo (volto, busto, braccia e piedi) erano rese con un rivestimento di avorio, gli occhi con pietre colorate. Nella mano destra, poggiata sul bracciolo, il dio reggeva la figura della figlia Nike (personificazione della vittoria) a grandezza naturale e con le ali spiegate. Nella sinistra teneva il lungo scettro a forma di lancia con, in cima, la figura di un'aquila, il sacro messaggero di Zeus. Verso la fine dell'età antica, un violento terremoto fece crollare il tempio, i cui resti furono riportati alla luce solo negli anni 1874-1881 con gli scavi archeologici condotti da una missione tedesca. Rimane il mistero di quale fine abbia fatto la famosa immagine di Zeus. A questo proposito esistono due ipotesi. Secondo la prima, la grandiosa scultura venne distrutta nell'anno 426 dopo Cristo, quando l'imperatore romano Teodosio II, proibendo lo svolgimento dei giochi olimpici, fece anche chiudere il santuario di Olimpia. Secondo un'altra versione, la statua sarebbe stata trasportata a Costantinopoli e collocata nel palazzo di un alto funzionario della città. Quando, nel 476 dopo Cristo, il palazzo crollò in seguito a un incendio, la statua sarebbe andata distrutta insieme a esso.Figlia di Zeus e sorella d'Apollo, Artemide (la Diana dei romani) era tra le dee più venerate dell'antichità: protettrice degli animali, dominava anche sulle streghe e i riti occulti. Nel VI secolo avanti Cristo, gli abitanti di Efeso vollero innalzare in suo onore il più grandioso tempio della storia, e chiamarono a realizzarlo l'architetto Teodoro di Samo. Sorto sul luogo di un precedente santuario, anch'esso dedicato alla dea, l'Artemision misurava 50 metri per 103, l'ambiente centrale, o cella, era scoperto e circondato sui quattro lati da due file di 20 colonne ciascuna sui lati lunghi, di nove sul retro e di otto su quello dell'ingresso, rivolto verso ovest. La fama del tempio era grande in tutto il mondo antico per i suoi splendidi fregi e per la selva di colonne alte 19 metri donate da Creso, il ricchissimo re della Lidia. In seguito un folle, Erostrato, incendiò il tempio. Ricostruito nel 333 avanti Cristo, l'Artemision fu distrutto dai Goti nel 262 dopo Cristo e poi, in età bizantina, i suoi resti rimasero sepolti sotto sei metri di fango dopo la piena del fiume Caistro. Del più grandioso di tutti i templi dell'antichità restano oggi solo una colonna e dei materiali reimpiegati nella vicina fortezza dell'XI secolo.Forse non tutti sanno che il termine "mausoleo", che indica una tomba monumentale che ospita le spoglie di un illustre personaggio, deriva dall'edificio eretto nella città di Alicarnasso (l'odierna Bodrum, nella Turchia sud-occidentale) per accogliere le spoglie di Mausolo, il sàtrapo (governatore) del re di Persia, signore della Caria, morto nel 362 a. C. Di questa antica meraviglia restano oggi pochi frammenti, conservati soprattutto al British Museum di Londra. Secondo quanto racconta lo storico latino Plinio, il monumento era a struttura tripartita: su una base alta 19 metri e di 33 metri per 39 di superficie, sorgeva un loggiato di 36 colonne ioniche alto 11 metri. Sul loggiato c'era una copertura a forma di piramide a gradini regolari, 24, forse per ricordare i corrispondenti anni di regno di Mausolo. Sopra ancora, a coronamento, era posta una quadriga guidata da Mausolo e dalla moglie Artemisia. Il monumento, realizzato dagli architetti Pitide e Satiro in marmo pario (una preziosa qualità di questo materiale) raggiungeva i 42 metri di altezza, pari più o meno a un palazzo di 14 piani. Fregi, sculture e statue di incommensurabile bellezza, che gli storici attribuiscono, tra gli altri, a Scopa, Leocare, Timoteo e Briasside, arricchivano l'imponente struttura dell'edificio. Dei tre fregi a rilievo, il primo con la rappresentazione di corse di carri, il secondo con la lotta tra i Greci e le Amazzoni e il terzo con la battaglia tra Lapiti e Centauri, si può ancora ammirare solamente uno straordinario frammento di quello delle Amazzoni, custodito al British Museum. Anche se non è possibile ricostruire l'esatta disposizione delle sculture e dell'ornamentazione, solamente dai frammenti che rimangono si intuisce la straordinaria qualità del monumento. Nel XII secolo un terremoto minò la solidità dell'edificio, ma alla sua distruzione contribuirono soprattutto i cavalieri dell'ordine di San Giovanni che, nel 1402, occuparono Alicarnasso e vi costruirono la fortezza di San Pietro. All'inizio del Cinquecento, per rinforzare la fortezza, i cavalieri si servirono del Mausoleo come di una cava, e fu così che, a poco a poco, il sepolcro di Mausolo fu demolito. Ancora oggi, malgrado il lavoro dell'archeologo inglese Charles T. Newton, che cominciò a scavare in quell'area nel 1856, non è chiaro se il sarcofago di Mausolo fosse in una cella o, piuttosto, in una camera funeraria all'interno delle fondamenta, sotto il monumento vero e proprio. Nel frattempo, l'ipotesi più accreditata è che non si trattasse del monumento funerario di un solo sovrano, ma di un sepolcro eretto in onore e a ricordo di un'intera dinastia, quella degli Ecatomnidi. A questa nuova ipotesi si è giunti grazie alla statuaria rinvenuta più di recente. Le statue sono infatti di tre dimensioni: "al naturale", "eroica" (due metri circa) e "colossale" (tre metri circa). Le statue di Mausolo e di Artemisia (quest'ultima danneggiata) sono dell'ultimo tipo ma sono stati individuati i frammenti di almeno altre dieci statue colossali simili. Una tomba di famiglia, dunque? Una missione archeologica turco-danese tra il 1966 e il 1977 ha potuto esplorare per la prima volta la camera funeraria sotterranea del Mausoleo e ha rilevato che era composta da un ambiente centrale e da due piccoli vestiboli antistanti. Essa non era collocata al centro dell'edificio, ma nell'angolo nord-occidentale delle fondamenta, e l'accesso era sbarrato da una grossa pietra del peso di diverse tonnellate. Sempre grazie all'indagine compiuta da questa missione turco-danese, si è appurato che il Mausoleo sorgeva all'interno di un antico cimitero, in uso fin dal VI secolo avanti Cristo.Anche nell'antica Grecia esisteva una Statua della Libertà, imponente quanto quella che sorge all'ingresso del porto di New York e senz'altro, data l'epoca di costruzione, ben più sconvolgente. La storia infatti racconta che nel 305-304 avanti Cristo uno dei più potenti successori di Alessandro Magno, dall'eloquente nome di Demetrio Poliorcete ("espugnatore di città"), prese d'assedio l'isola greca di Rodi. Gli abitanti riuscirono a scongiurare la minaccia stringendo un trattato di pace con Demetrio. In segno di gratitudine agli dei per essere stati liberati dall'incubo dell'assedio, gli isolani eressero una gigantesca statua di bronzo in onore della divinità patrona di Rodi: Helios, il dio del Sole (piuttosto atipico nel pantheon greco, in quanto s'identificava in un fenomeno naturale). La statua era la più grande mai costruita: la sua altezza, secondo le fonti, andava dai 70 agli 80 cubiti, ovvero dai 32 ai 36 metri, compresa la base. I lavori, eseguiti sotto la direzione dell'artista Carete di Lindo, allievo del famoso scultore Lisippo, durarono dodici anni, verosimilmente dal 304 al 292 avanti Cristo. Qual era l'aspetto della statua? La risposta è difficile, poiché sul Colosso, distrutto da un terremoto già nel 224 avanti Cristo, si hanno meno informazioni che su qualsiasi altra delle Sette meraviglie. Tra le gambe del gigante Le tradizionali raffigurazioni della statua mostrano il Colosso all'ingresso del porto dell'isola. La mano destra regge una torcia (o, secondo altre ricostruzioni, ripara lo sguardo rivolto al mare) e le gambe sono divaricate in modo da consentire l'entrata e l'uscita delle navi. Quest'ipotesi cade se si pensa che le navi potevano essere alte più di 20 metri; inoltre, dal punto di vista della statica è insostenibile che l'enorme statua poggiasse solo sui propri piedi. Ci doveva essere un terzo punto di appoggio (per esempio un drappo ricadente fino a terra) che, insieme ai piedi, formava un triangolo di sostegno, aumentando così la stabilità dell'intera, enorme struttura. Qualche certezza in più circonda la presenza di una sorgente luminosa posta al di sopra della statua, come testimonia una scritta dedicatoria incisa sul possente basamento marmoreo del Colosso. Questa luce forse era riflessa dalla chioma, dalla veste o dal volto stesso del Colosso, ricoperti in foglia d'oro. Un'immagine più dettagliata della testa del Colosso (che si sa per certo cinta da una corona di raggi aurei) è offerta dall'imponente testa marmorea di età ellenistica conservata al museo di Rodi e corrispondente, con grande verosimiglianza, a quella della colossale Meraviglia.Tra le Sette meraviglie del mondo antico, il faro di Alessandria è l'unico a essere balzata agli onori della cronaca in questi ultimi tempi. Nel bacino portuale della grande città egiziana, a pochi chilometri dal delta del Nilo, sono infatti in corso da tempo imponenti ricerche di archeologia subacquea con l'obiettivo di ricuperare i resti di uno dei più affascinanti complessi monumentali dell'antichità. Occorre precisare che il termine "faro" deriva dal nome greco di un'isola, Pharos, al largo di Alessandria (la città fondata nell'aprile del 331 avanti Cristo dal principe macedone da cui prende il nome). Alessandro Magno volle unire Pharos alla terraferma facendo costruire una diga lunga circa 1200 metri che, via via allargatasi, costituisce oggi la penisoletta di Ras-et-Tin. Su uno scoglio a oriente dell'isola di Pharos si trovava, appunto, una grande torre con un faro. Alla morte del giovane sovrano macedone, otto anni dopo la fondazione della città, Alessandria divenne la capitale dell'Egitto dei Tolomei. In età tolemaica (304 avanti Cristo - 30 dopo Cristo) Alessandria possedeva numerosi grandi edifici tra cui il famoso Sema, la tomba di Alessandro Magno, e l'università dedicata alle muse, il Museion, con la sua leggendaria biblioteca, la più grande raccolta di manoscritti del mondo antico: fondata da Tolomeo I, custodiva 700 mila volumi, in gran parte distrutti da un incendio nel 48 avanti Cristo, durante l'assedio di Giulio Cesare alla città egiziana. Ma nessuno di questi edifici, per quanto splendidi, raggiungeva la fama del faro, l'unico a essere annoverato tra le Sette meraviglie del mondo. La sua costruzione iniziò nei primi decenni del dominio tolemaico sulla città. La torre vera e propria era circondata da una terrazza rettangolare con un perimetro di 340 metri e protetta da possenti muri frangi-onde. La costruzione, interamente rivestita al suo esterno in marmo, aveva una struttura tripartita: un corpo rettangolare (di 30,60 metri per lato e alto 71 metri), leggermente rastremato verso l'alto, costituiva la parte inferiore del faro. La prima torre terminava in un'ampia piattaforma, decorata ai quattro angoli da statue di tritoni. Dalla piattaforma, che ne era il basamento, si ergeva il secondo corpo del faro, una torre ottagonale assai più stretta, alta 34 metri. Date le dimensioni ridotte, quest'ultima torre era sprovvista di rampa da carico, e le scale proseguivano al suo interno. Sulla piattaforma dell'ottagono poggiava una struttura circolare che, al suo interno, conteneva l'impianto per l'illuminazione del faro. Questo si basava su una meravigliosa serie di specchi concavi, veri e propri riflettori che avevano la funzione di amplificare e direzionare la luce. L'edificio terminava con la cosiddetta lanterna (non nel senso di strumento per l'illuminazione, ma in quello architettonico di costruzione circolare con lucernari, che serve a coronare un edificio), una piccola ed elegante struttura poggiata su colonne e ricoperta da un tetto conico, sormontato da una statua di Zeus (o di Posidone). Con un'altezza complessiva di 120-140 metri, il faro di Alessandria era (non considerando le piramidi di Cheope e di Chefren), la più alta costruzione dell'antichità. Il faro di Alessandria rimase intatto per quasi mille anni, fino a quando una serie di terremoti causò il progressivo crollo del monumento. Le sue imponenti rovine giacevano abbandonate all'ingresso del Porto Grande da circa cento anni quando, nel 1480, il sultano mamelucco Kait Bey decise di far fortificare la costa ed eresse, sul luogo dell'antica meraviglia, un castello tuttora esistente, che porta ancor oggi il nome del suo costruttore.E' la più antica delle Sette meraviglie e non ha ancora svelato tutti i suoi segreti. Eppure, la piramide di Cheope è l'unica a essersi conservata relativamente integra. Ancora oggi, a undici chilometri a sud-ovest del Cairo, la capitale egiziana, la si può ammirare praticamente intatta sulla riva sinistra del Nilo e sullo sfondo del deserto libico. Insieme a essa sorgono altre due importanti piramidi, quelle di Chefren e Micerino. Tutte e tre sono intitolate a faraoni della Quarta dinastia (XXVI secolo avanti Cristo). La più alta di tutte, la piramide di Cheope, ha giustamente meritato il titolo di meraviglia del mondo antico. E' alta 146,60 metri e, per costruirla, ci vollero sette milioni di tonnellate di pietra: una massa di pietra maggiore di quella impiegata dagli inglesi nel corso di mille anni per la costruzione di tutte le loro chiese. Per erigerla occorsero vent'anni di lavoro ininterrotto prestato da un esercito di 100 mila persone (per la maggior parte schiavi) che, si calcola, dovevano collocare i blocchi di pietra al ritmo di uno ogni minuto e mezzo. La struttura della piramide è in calcare locale, mentre il rivestimento è in pietra importata dalle cave di Tura, sulla riva destra del Nilo. L'interno è un intrico di corridoi, rampe e gallerie, mentre alla camera sepolcrale (progettata su tre diversi livelli e con il sarcofago posto sul più alto) si giunge attraverso un corridoio di accesso in salita, detto la "Grande galleria". E' stato calcolato che la Piramide è più alta della cattedrale di Strasburgo e che nella sua base, di 230 metri per 230, potrebbero trovare posto tutte le più grandi basiliche del mondo. L'accesso alla piramide è sul lato settentrionale, a 16,80 metri dal suolo, ed è costituito da un budello talmente stretto (largo 1,05 metri e alto 1,20) che permetteva appena il trasporto della mummia del sovrano. Dal passaggio, come si diceva, si arriva a tre diverse camere poste una sull'altra, forse corrispondenti a tre diversi stadi della costruzione della piramide. La camera inferiore (8,20 metri per 14 di superficie e 3,50 di altezza) è incompleta, e quando fu scoperta, nel 1838, si presentava come una cava di pietra e non conteneva nulla che ne indicasse la funzione. Anche l'uso della camera centrale, detta "della regina", non è chiaro; misurava 5,20 metri per 5,60 di superficie ed era ricoperta da una volta a cuspide di 6,20 metri di altezza. In diagonale, sopra la Camera della regina, si trova la Grande galleria, una delle opere più straordinarie lasciate dall'antico regno all'umanità. Lunga 47 metri e alta 8,50, la galleria è larga appena 2,30 metri. Le pareti interne, tutte in pietra calcarea levigata, a partire da 2,30 metri di altezza aggettano gradatamente verso l'interno formando una volta a mensola con sette strati di pietre, ognuno sporgente di otto centimetri rispetto al precedente. Ancora ci si interroga sulla funzione di questa struttura. Un'ipotesi vuole che fosse utilizzata come magazzino per i blocchi di granito che avrebbero poi dovuto sigillare per sempre l'ingresso della piramide dopo la deposizione della mummia regale nella sua ultima dimora. La camera sepolcrale vera e propria, detta anche "Camera del re", consta di un vestibolo in granito rosso dal quale si accede, attraverso una piccola apertura (1,5 metri per 1,8), al cuore stesso del monumento: il sepolcro. Tutto in granito rosa di Assuan, l'ambiente misura 5,20 metri per 10,30 ed è alto 5,80 metri. Gli enormi blocchi di granito sono disposti con precisione talmente minuziosa che gli interstizi tra l'uno e l'altro raggiungono appena lo spessore di un capello, e questo, oltre alle immense difficoltà materiali e logistiche incontrate nel trasporto e nella collocazione dei materiali da costruzione, fa riflettere sulla grande abilità tecnica degli architetti e degli ingegneri al servizio dei faraoni egizi. Sopra, altri quattro ambienti a soffitto piatto e un quinto con il tetto a piramide hanno la funzione di distribuire l'enorme peso che altrimenti graverebbe tutto sulla camera sepolcrale. Infine, davanti alla parete occidentale della camera sepolcrale c'è il sarcofago del faraone: si tratta di un unico grande blocco scavato di granito nero, troppo voluminoso per poter passare per le strette gallerie d'accesso alla piramide. Logica vuole, dunque, che il sarcofago sia stato collocato nella camera sepolcrale prima che venisse completata la copertura definitiva della piramide. Da ciò consegue che resta ancora aperto un antichissimo interrogativo: Cheope fu davvero sepolto nella piramide?Giardini artificiali creati dal nulla, effetti ottici che proiettavano l'osservatore in un paesaggio da fiaba, geniali sistemi d'irrigazione. Eppure, all'epoca della conquista di Babilonia da parte di Alessandro Magno (331 avanti Cristo) i celebrati giardini pensili di Semiramide non erano considerati una meraviglia del mondo, e neppure il fastoso palazzo di Nabucodonosor II, re di Babilonia dal 605 al 562 avanti Cristo, o la leggendaria torre di Babilonia. Questo titolo era invece attribuito alle mura di cinta di Babilonia, e in particolare al "Muro orientale" fatto erigere da Nabucodonosor a est della città e che per i Greci doveva rappresentare ciò che la Grande muraglia cinese era per le orde mongole. Il Muro orientale, lungo 1650 metri, parte integrante degli otto chilometri della cinta urbana, era in realtà composto da due muri, uno interno e uno esterno. La distanza tra di essi, di circa 12 metri, era interamente riempita di terra pressata. Si formava così un ampio camminamento che, considerando anche gli spessori delle mura stesse, poteva raggiungere la larghezza di 24 metri, consentendo il contemporaneo passaggio di due carri trainati da cavalli. Nella cinta muraria, inframmezzata da grandi torri a pianta quadrata, si aprivano otto enormi porte intitolate ad altrettante divinità babilonesi; allo Staatliche Museen di Berlino si può ammirare la ricostruzione della porta di Ishtar, con le sue magnifiche decorazioni in mattonelle policrome smaltate raffiguranti draghi e tori. Sui giardini pensili di Babilonia la fantasia degli uomini si è sbizzarrita, allontanandosi dal significato originario trasmesso dalle antiche fonti letterarie con il latino horti pensilis (giardini pensili), che non indicava altro che una serie di terrazze disposte a gradoni. La denominazione, entrata nella leggenda, di "giardini pensili di Semiramide" è, invece, la (tarda) descrizione di quei giardini che il re Nabucodonosor fece costruire per compiacere la sua sposa e placare la sua nostalgia, creando per lei un illusorio paesaggio artificiale di montagne e boschi a imitazione della sua terra d'origine, la Media, antica regione dell'Iran. Per quanto la loro ubicazione esatta non sia ancora stata accertata con precisione, per gli studiosi l'esistenza dei giardini pensili, testimoniata dalle antiche fonti babilonesi e greche, è fuori discussione. Robert Koldewey, l'archeologo tedesco che per primo, tra il 1898 e il 1914, riportò alla luce i resti di gran parte della città di Babilonia, credette di poterli situare nell'angolo nord-orientale del Palazzo sud, la grande dimora cittadina di Nabucodonosor. E' qui che egli si imbatté nell'edificio cosiddetto a volte, le cui possenti fondamenta, secondo Koldewey, dovevano probabilmente sorreggere i grandi terrazzamenti artificiali dei giardini di Semiramide. Inoltre (e questo avrebbe risolto ogni problema d'irrigazione), il corso del fiume Eufrate attraversava da nord a sud la città, lambendo i palazzi reali e dei nobili. L'inglese D. J. Wiseman, grande studioso dell'Assiria antica, ha di recente formulato un'ipotesi completamente diversa: i giardini pensili non si trovavano nel Palazzo sud bensì nel Palazzo nord, all'esterno delle mura cittadine. Secondo Wiseman, il pendio tra la collina dove sorgeva il palazzo e la depressione del fiume Eufrate era ricoperto da terrazzamenti che formavano un unico, grande parco, quello appunto dei giardini di Semiramide. Meritano un cenno le personalità di Nabucodonosor e di Semiramide. Conquistatore della Siria e della Palestina, dopo aver rafforzato l'impero il fiero guerriero Nabucodonosor si ingentilì e si dedicò ad abbellire e restaurare Babilonia.

fejv23shaa	Romania’s facist dictatorship, led by the ‘conducator’ - or leader - was one of the more anti-semitic nations of Germany’s circle. Early, in 1941 - Romania’s Jewish population was openly slaughtered in the streets of Bucharest. Later, many were deported to concentration camps. However, it’s important to remember that in September of 1944, Romania changed teams. When the Soviet Union invaded Romania, the ‘conducator’ had wanted to surrender - but he was told to fight Germany, instead.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	In 1940 Stalin had sent the Red Army to occupy Moldova, the Romanian province bordering Russia.Romania joined the war on the German side firstly because they were scared of a full scale Russian invasion, and secondly because Hitler promised that they would regain Moldova once the USSR was defeated.|`|85a0fa252f2147419dc9d5d05017495eaa	On April 13, 1938, Germany and the United Kingdom had pledged to guarantee the independence of Romania. But negotiations with the Soviets concerning a similar guarantee collapsed when Romania refused to allow the Red Army to cross its frontiers.<br>  <br>  On August 23, 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Among other things, this pact stipulated the Soviet "interest" in Bessarabia (which had been ruled by Imperial Russia from 1812 to 1918). This Soviet interest was combined with a clear indication that there was an explicit lack of any German interest in the area.<br>  <br>  Eight days later, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Romania officially remained neutral, but granted refuge to members of Poland's fleeing government. After the assassination of Prime Minister Armand C?linescu on 21 September, King Carol tried to maintain neutrality for several months more. But the surrender of France and the retreat of British forces from continental Europe rendered meaningless the assurances that both countries had made to Romania.<br>  <br>   <br>  In 1940, Romania lost territory in both the east and the west. In July, after a Soviet ultimatum, Romania agreed to give up Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Two thirds of Bessarabia were combined with a small part of USSR to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The rest (Northern Bukovina and Budjak) was apportioned to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Shortly thereafter, on 30 August, under the Second Vienna Award (or Vienna Diktat/Vienna Arbitration), Germany and Italy forced Romania to give half of Transylvania to Hungary. The Hungarians received a region referred to as "Northern Transylvania", while "Southern Transylvania" remained Romanian. Hungary had lost all of Transylvania after World War I in the Treaty of Trianon. They had never surrendered the ambition of regaining the territory. On 7 September, under the Treaty of Craiova, the Kadrilater or "Quadrilateral" (the southern part of Dobrudja) was ceded to Bulgaria (from which it had been taken at the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913). Given the relatively recent unification of all the territories Romanians have felt as historically belonging to them on one hand, and on the other hand the fact that so much land was lost without a fight, these territorial losses shattered the underpinnings of King Carol's power.<br>  <br>  On July 4, 1940, Ion Gigurtu formed the first Romanian government to include an Iron Guardist minister: Horia Sima. Sima was a particularly virulent anti-Semite who had become the nominal leader of the movement after Codreanu's death. Sima was one of the few prominent legionnaires to survive the carnage of the preceding years.<br>  (wikipedia)<br>  <br>  my opinion: as you see, the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact had already cut off half of the country. Bad internal and external politics, combined with the hope to regain the lost territories lead to Romania joining the Germany.

iY36ARNwaa	I'm the exact same way. The only time when my mind is at it's intellectual best is after 1 a.m. <br>  Otherwise I have people banging my door open and asking what I'm doing, and the sounds of TV and music blaring downstairs. Then I feel like I just need to get the thought out real quick and not even bother putting it in perfect form. It's irritating to the extreme.|`|lQAFS11Aaa	Have you tried cutting the work into several tasks: the first to "outline" in some way what you want to accomplish and what you want to say; double space so that you can add notes as you review it.  Thoughts do not tumble out in logical order, unfortunately.  Let them pour, jot them down, don't worry about how it looks or "reads" at this point.  Then go back and number the sequences of events and put it all into logical order, filling in details of the sketched ideas.  Finally, a third step, which is to edit what you say and how you say it.  Structure your ideas so that they flow, and the reader can't stop reading because the sentence patterns keep the eye moving.  But that is the third step.  Then, of course, when the story/novel is completed, you want to have it edited.  But finish each part as a unit.  Hope this helps.|`|O84V4pYIaa	I can't write well when I feel rushed or get nervous either. I don't think you can 'fix' that. I need to be alone, or at least uninterrupted to write well. If I get an interruption I can't seem to get my groove back for a while. Just find more time to be alone to write, or take advantage of the time you do have.|`|hci2me2kaa	I guess you should probably just write when you're not feeling rushed. Or try sitting quietly for a few minutes to calm yourself and then go ahead and try.|`|XxtVwslraa	Then only write when you're relaxed and have a good amount of time on your hands. Take deep breaths and try to clear any distractions from your mind. If you only have say thirty minutes to write and that is generally not enough time for you, write anyways. Just remind yourself that you don't need to rush. If you're not done with what you're writing then also remind yourself that you can continue later. If you're dealing with deadlines, start as early as possible. Consider locking yourself in a room and playing soft music to help you relax,<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

RLQPWkXCaa	From another question site, where someone asked the same question:<br>  <br>  "Yes it is...THey asked my sister to do the same thing (she is gorgeous).....she ended up paying over $5,000 on headshots and photo studio fees and then they said they couldn't find her any gigs. It's a scam. If you are model material, walk into a REAL modeling agency and they will want you."<br>  <br>  "This is definitely a come-on, not necessarily a scam. Years ago when I first came to New York I was one of the first men to be accepted into the Barbizon Modeling School. I thought I had broken the gender barrier. I enrolled, paid my fee, took my classes, got listed in their Modeling Book - and got nothing after that. They take anyone who wants to enroll - even though they pretend to "decide on your qualifications and potential."<br>  Why? Because Barbizon exists on the school and industry people - legitimate people in the business - don't book Barbizon Models for work. I was young then - and green. I learned. Do yourself a favor - look elsewhere. No model should ever have to PAY to be a model.

It's a nice bunch of words put together, but that's what it is: a nice bunch of words. It doesn't really make me feel anything. I think a poem should make you feel something. It's either you identify with her or you pity her. But I don't feel either way when I read this. <br>  <br>  But maybe that's just me.|`|s0edwYSmaa	it's interesting and very descriptive about feelings and <br>  the place she's in<br>  <br>  and i like interesting things|`|xylAmI68aa	it is not that bad it is good
eNMRIKL6aa	Great wisdom. He was extraordinary at putting words together in poignant and clever ways.<br>  <br>  It's not easy to live by that rule, though. You should always stay true to your self, but it's not easy to brush off all the negative feedback you get from other people.

61k1sohoaa	hmmm. this is a tricky one !<br>  <br>  How about, one day, a lady albino was in the forest and found a baby on the floor . ( a non-albino baby ) and thought it had a disease so she took care of it, and loved it.<br>  <br>  It grew up, hidden from humans, because the lady was scared the other albinos would kill it, until an albino girl his age saw him.<br>  <br>  They fell in love, and she convinced him no albino would judge him for his hair or skin, but when he was introduced to the public they did, and they tried to kill him.<br>  <br>  The albino girl and the normal guy were so in love they fled and went into hiding - but didnt mind as they loved spending time together. They had many babys - which had babys - which had babys, etc. <br>  until there were more of them and less albinos.<br>  <br>  eventually, 70% of the population became tanned/normal, and then decided to get revenge on the albinos for trying to destroy there race years and years ago.<br>  <br>  They killed most albinos, but know that there is peace, there is still only a few left.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope you like it :)|`|09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa	One albino animal/person fell into paint and looked so ridiculous and was so embarassed that all the other albinos (except for the enemies of the painted albino) also painted themselves in solidarity so the painted albino wouldn't feel so bad.<br>  <br>  Flesh it out a bit, and you've got a myth...<br>  Luck!|`|E7Gt9PTOaa	um ok.|`|y3tjm3Izaa	okkkkkk|`|85zluzcvaa	How about...the ice age ended and the sun came out and everyone else got tanned except them.

The king is not liked by the public, but he has protected them from many attacks on the kingdom and because of that the peasants respect and honor him. <br>  <br>    The king's wife died of the black plague and the king has become incredibly depressed. He has ordered that nobody may enter the castle walls or leave them unless they are running errands for him. All the curtains must remain shut and he is not to be disturbed by anyone. <br>  <br>    Years pass and the servant boy becomes best friends with the kings son Benjamin. The friendship is forbidden and Gregory's father Jacob tells him this repeatedly; but it does not stop. <br>  <br>    On Benjamin's seventeenth birthday, while everybody is preparing a banquet, there is a scream. Everybody runs outside to see what had happened. The king had jumped from the window in his chambers. His depression had become to much for him to bear. <br>  <br>    Benjamin is made king and his first order is to allow people back into the castle so that they may speak with their new king. The day after the order is fulfilled, a small man dressed in the robes of a preacher approaches King Benjamin. He tells Benjamin that his fathers death and his rise to power is part of a prophecy. The prophecy states that the Hero of the Divine will rise to assist the people in need when the Fallen Crusader rises once again. <br>  <br>    He goes on to explain that the Fallen Crusader will be released out of anger when a king with a heart of stone dies of a broken heart. The king will live for eternity away from his wife for attempting to be reunited with her once more. The king will be approached by the Fallen Crusader who will tell the king that he can bring him to the heavens to be with his wife if he releases him from the chains of the evil god. The king will be fooled by the words of the Fallen Crusader and will release him. The Crusader will once again rise to the surface world and begin his eternal reign as the dark ruler, leaving the foolish king to rot. <br>  <br>    King Benjamin will be worried, but first angry that a crazy old fool would dare speak about his dead father in such a manner. Benjamin is not convinced that the prophecy will come true, and order the man to be locked in the dungeon. Gregory is angered by the way Benjamin just dismissed the mans warnings like that, and claims that Benjamin's dad would have listened. Benjamin is extremely furious, and thinks that his friend has turned on him. Gregory is taken to the dungeons as well.<br>  <br>    Gregory is put into the same cell the preacher is in. Gregory is told by the preacher that before the Crusader rises, there will be five signs that follow the omen. He says that there will be a child of evil that will be born as a warning from the devil. The first sign will be the death of the parents of the demon child. The second sign will be a field of fire. The third sign will be the death of livestock. The Fourth sign will be an infestation of rats. The last sign is the appearance of a hag. The hag will wear tattered green robes, and will not be recognized by anyone of the villagers. This hag must be destroyed, for she is a witch that will help bring the Crusader into the world.<br>  <br>  The story can be continued from there.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it is not very good. It is just the main idea and I am in the Ninth grade so you may not find it very good.|`|0KqCsW8gaa	How about a story about someone finding a mysterious object at some old ruins.

Then I wasted my time writing this. <br>  <br>  THE END! : D|`|XfWo7AXhaa	Well, I was born December 22 1988.  The early years of my life were awesome~I was the first child and am the only girl in my family.  When I was two my brother Sean was born, and we were pretty tight.  I remember my Grammie taking us out a lot with my cousins Kevin and Stephen (our same ages).  We would go to Greenfield Village and parks!  When I was six my other brother Evan was born.  We are a very close family and my childhood was filled with playing outside, going camping and vacationing in Oscoda, Michigan on Lake Huron.  I played soccer and figure skated.  I attened St. Linus Elementry from pre-school through 8th grade and always got really good grades.  My dad is one of nine children, so I always loved Christmas and Thanksgiving because it was such a big family!  My mom is one of four, and everyone lived very close, so we were always seeing each other!  I do have one aunt who used to live in California, and she always spoiled me :)  In fact, she still does!  Anyway, during middle school I had three best friends, and we were the popular ones.  But seeing as we only had 24 people in our class, that's not saying much haha But I loved to flirt and had my first 'boyfriend' in 6th grade and my first kiss in 7th~I was sooo scared!  From 6-8th grade I played for a girls hockey team and was the assistant captain.  Unfortunatley I broke my collarbone playing soccer, so I couldn't play either sport for a while.<br>  I then went to Divine Child Highschool in Dearborn and loved it.  I made so many new friends those first two years.  I was on the JV soccer team for two years, and then Varsity for two.<br>  I traveled to Australia between sophomore and junior year with People to People Student Ambassadors.  I had the first love of my life during that summer, and we had such an amazing time.  His name was Jose, and he cheated on me when I was traveling.  First heart break.<br>  Junior year I fell in love for the second time.  Nick Broggi.  He had the greatest adam's apple. (i think they are really sexy in a guy).  We dated for about 8 months, then he pressured me to have sex, and we broke up. Second heart break.<br>  Senior year was the best time of my life.  Everyone seemed to break down popularity barriers and we had some great times!  Sean was a sophomore now, and all his friends loved to tease him about me.  I loved flirting with them! <br>  My best friend for four years was Chris Gargala.  I couldn't have made it through highschool without him.  Sophomore year he told me he liked me, and then continued to let me know all three years.  I didn't see him like that, and our friendship continued.<br>  I was in the musicals all four years as a dancer.  I have been dancing all my life~ballet/pointe, jazz, hip hop, tap and kickline.<br>  At the end of senior year I realized I loved Chris.  The best night of my life happend on April 25 2007 when we were in his car drinking Starbucks.  I was getting around to telling him I loved him when he just leaned in and kissed my brains out!  That was the best kiss I've ever had.  We have been dating now for almost 2 years, and I am the most in love as I have ever been (third times the charm right?)  <br>  I attend Central Michigan University on a full ride scholarship.  I love the campus here, although I am a little sick of school.  My roomates are too brilliant for words~we went in blind last year and just clicked. Now in our sophomore year we are roomates again and just signed a lease for our apartment next year! We are SO excited.  We have been skinny dipping in the Chippewa River.<br>  I am majoring in Public Relations.  I was a double major in Spanish also, but I dropped it only two months ago!  <br>  Right now I am about to go shopping for chili supplies because I am competing in a chili cook-off tomorrow.<br>  Well, that's my life story, I'm not sure why you wanted it, but I hope you enjoyed! <br>  <3<br>  Jackie|`|rh5vbol9aa	Its possible to write life story, but we must be very careful, because we can be easily expressionist!|`|jo0uRJC9aa	You want my life story?

fa7408dcfae58ca954b18c239808b896aa	The Declaration of Independance was done to make it clear as to the intention of our Founding Fathers. To List the grievences against The King and the Paliment of England and Declare that the Colonies had severed their political bonds and were going to form their own state.  the first two paragraphs state:<br>  <br>  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br>  <br>  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, the Declaration of Independance was needed to severe the political Bonds Between The Colonies and Mother England.  With out it, we would not have Burned our Bridge and it would have been harder to motivate people, especialy our leaders into fighting the war. So without it we may not be here.|`|8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	I don't think anything would "happen."  Our Country sure wouldn't cease to exist just because something wasn't done 250 years ago.<br>  I think the more accurate question would be what if those brave men HAD NOT written and signed their names to the Declaration of Independence.  That is a bit thought provoking.  We would still be a colony.|`|0zWmJQMJaa	well i dont know now but u can see the movie national tresure its a disney movie is not like a history thing and they say there but i dont know what they said word by word.|`|7AqBiRcwaa	The U.S. would be very much like England because England does NOT have a Declaration of Independence nor does it have a WRITTEN CONSTITUTION... so I think you could make a good case for the U.S. to have a parliamentary type of government just like England|`|AA11826043	We would fall apart because we would have no laws, no freedoms, an autocratic leader, and obviously an Autocracy.<br>  <br>  Do your own homework.|`|e548da6998c99c7fde75cde6b4eebfc3aa	I get that you want answers, but why dont' you research all of the things that the D of I did for us and then write what you think we would be without these benefits.  I could tell you right now that our taxes would be higher.|`|7b69ab02a4b4ab9c74723bdc2bacf0c6aa	Actually, the better question would be, "What would happen to the world with out the U.S. Declaration of Independence?"  Initially, as another person has noted, the bravery that the signers showed spawned a revolution and the beginning of the United States of America, so we would still probably be a colony of Great Britain.  Also, our revolution would not have spawned other revolutionaries in France, Russia, Vietnam, South America, etc.  <br>  <br>  Essentially, without the Declaration of Independence, the world would still probably be ruled by 3-5 monarchies and the rivalries from them would have spawned multiple more wars than have actually occurred.

jo0uRJC9aa	not sure about all of them but i do freestyle dance and that just incorporates hip-hop with a bit of street and modern dance. Freestyle is more laid back in my opinion and i find quite easy to get into. It includes a wide range of techniques like body rolls,  bodys what i call bops, hips, kicking, the splits in some cases and yeah just loads of stuff. it isn't as precise as ballet or tap and as i said more laid back.
O1wc4pM3aa	It is our Egoism that does this.  Many people value love affairs as a trophy game...   Once a person does not reciprocate, does not return the interest, does not get committed, we feel as....."defeated" and this, our egoism can't accept it!  So we run after them to finally "win" them by making them ours!!!   The funny thing is that on such cases, once we make them ours, we ..."win" them, ...we lose all interest in them~!   Because our target has been attained. :  Our Egoism got satisfied..<br>  <br>  When teenager I was like that...  Now, after a lot of experience I can give this advice :  Once they don't love you, wish them well and run away...<br>  Running after a person who doesn't love us is the absolute entrapping, is Hell itself.   And most important, it is not the other person who is damaging us, but Us, our own stupid Egoism...<br>  <br>  Yes, it is human nature but we must ....educate this nature to function towards our peace of mind and heart!!  :)|`|eEfao2Dcaa	We run after things we cant have because another human nature is that we sometimes prefer things that are hard to get or are challenging....<br>  <br>  Why again?....<br>  Because, we have this voice saying that there IS a chance and we want to know wether we have what it takes to risk some things to reach our ambition and when we finally get that certain thing we have for so long been chasing, we get this sense of triumph.... we believe in ourselves that we had achieved something great in our lives.....|`|vxbzE9hNaa	what you cant have looks more precoius than you have already,<br>  some ppl have low self esteem so if they are being loved they think there is something worng so they go after someone who doesnt love them|`|D8sN8gNFaa	That.....also the fact that people want things they can't have, because they know there is that microscopic chance of success.|`|fBnXS5qwaa	Because we are expecting something from them! and love expects no returns and if are expecting something that is all Business, give and take system... merely a barter system.

I spend more time reading online stories and articles than I spend reading books. A 300 page novel will take me around 4 to 5 hours. In my dorm room I read on my bed, at home I either read on my bed or in a comfy chair. I'll listen to music if I'm reading fluff, but if I'm reading something substantial I need silence. Any kind of short stories and fantasy are my favorites, but I can't stand westerns or chick lit. Romances are fine, but chick lit. just annoys me. I read a lot, but I wouldn't call myself an avid reader.<br>  <br>  If you can't stick to a story, try reading short stories or listening to an audio book. An audio book forces you to pay attention to every word. Short stories are shorter (obviously), so you don't need a long attention span. You can read them in one sitting too, so you don't forget the plot.
AA11898755	Tweaking won't solve the problem. If it is clearly his work it'll still be clearly his. IF in your fiction  he does not function as an active character doing things that he in real life might find offensive or objectional then stating aspects of the theory and attributing them to him  is no different than someone writing a critical or academic work citing - AND CREDITING - his research. The key is that you may not appropriate HIM and represent HIM as actively participating in your story. He is not a public personage and is therefore not fair game, unlike clearly fictionalizing a conversation with Tom Cruise or Laura Bush for example. If you attribute words or actions to him you would need his permission. If you simply state the fact of his work and his ownership of it there is no harm.|`|emOhSyY5aa	Yes I would suggest tweaking it a little. But if you are uncertain you should write to the theorist and tell him how you plan on using his/her theory.

Romanticism is a style of writing and art, based around nature and humanity. Dark Romanticism I would assume would have to be natural things about death.|`|pQqGmQ99aa	It's begin romantic in a "dark" or "gothic" way.  Like sending someone black roses.  Or writing a poem using your own blood.  Or carrying a vile of your lovers blood around with you on a string tied around your next.  It's being romantic in a darker, non conventional way.

jFSHx51Jaa	Finland and USSR had a "friendship" treaty, the quotes are there due to Soviet Union pressuring Finland to do it. There was no real friendship between Finland and Soviet Union.

pI5jKfmaaa	Finlandization  is the influence that one powerful country may have on the policies of a smaller neighboring country.<br>  <br>  It is generally considered to be pejorative, originating in West German political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s. As the term was used in Germany and other NATO countries, it meant the process of turning into a country which, although maintaining national sovereignty, in foreign politics resolves not to challenge a more powerful neighbour. Commonly in reference to Finland's policies vis-à-vis the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but could refer to similar international relations, such as Denmark's attitude toward Germany between 1871 and 1940.<br>  <br>  <br>  In Finland, the use (by others) of the term "Finlandization" was perceived as blunt criticism[citation needed], stemming from an inability to understand the practicalities of how a small nation might hope to make a deal with a culturally and ideologically alien superpower, without losing its sovereignty. It is said that the purpose of Finlandization was primarily Realpolitik: to survive. On the other hand, the threat of the Soviet Union was used also in Finland's domestic politics in a way that possibly deepened Finlandization (so called id?nkortti, "east card"). Finland cut such a deal with Joseph Stalin's government in the late 1940s, and it was largely respected by both parties — and to the gain of both parties — until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. While the Finnish political and intellectual elite mostly understood the term to refer more to foreign policy problems of other countries, and meant mostly for domestic consumption in the speaker's own country, many ordinary Finns considered the term highly offensive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandizat...</a>

g5CfXEcUaa	Darcy is a very distinguished, almost father figure type.  He is cold and guarded, whereas Bingley is more naive and susceptible to persuasion.  Darcy's tendency to be standoffish and judgmental, coupled with his modesty and pride to a fault, lead him to be misjudged by many, when he is, in fact, a very responsible and caring man.  Bingley has a far greater reputation among his neighbors, but his shyness and dependence on the assurance of others causes him to abandon the woman he loves.<br>   <br>  Darcy's critical nature softens greatly as he falls in love and he realizes how foolish he has been.  I personally think that his mistakes are due to losses and betrayals in his life as well as a need to conform to the social norms of the time.  After all, his love interest and especially her family are not on his level of social importance, wealth, or manners for that matter.  Bingley seems to be sort of unaware of these things in spite of the fact that they are incredibly pervasive at the time.  <br>  <br>  His nature is to follow; this is why the two men are such good friends; one is like a father, or big brother, and the other is the trusting boy who needs guidance and care.<br>  <br>  Your thesis statement is a restatement of the prompt.|`|RC2rHZMPaa	Mr Bingley: open, happy, optimistic, friendly, charming.<br>  <br>  Mr Darcy: brooding, quiet, reserved, sometimes awkward and unsure.<br>  <br>  You could describe Bingley as light, and Darcy as dark in terms of manner throughout most of the story.<br>  <br>  Bingley shares much more than Darcy - puts more of his personality out for people to see - Darcy's personality could be described as often hard to read throughout the story.|`|lpuu8DIIaa	Mr. Bingley was more open to love|`|AA10774810	For one, Mr. Bingley is more social than Mr. Darcy.|`|NnbR5Bauaa	Pride & Prejudice?<br>  <br>  Mr.Darcy: Kinda rude, mean, not as open, doesnt show much love.<br>  Mr.Bingley: Very open, loves, friendly, honest, kind.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen<br>  <br>  Characters:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/characters/literature/jane-austen/pride-and-prejudice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/characters/literat...</a><br>  <br>  ============================<br>  <br>  Below you will find five outstanding thesis statements for "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen that can be used as essay starters or paper topics.

You don't want to make them think you already have a cemented vision of the character. Do something in the style and spirit of Annie, but from another source.  "Over the Rainbow" is probably overused but that is an example of a song in the same ballpark.
Om7OhWRUaa	It's hard to find something bad to say about Tolstoy... The worst thing I can think of is that "War and Peace" is very long.<br>  <br>  Couldn't you choose a crappier writer?
DiRI58buaa	I take it you got the quote from Tolstoy's "The Cossacks".  The character is contemplating "the good life" and realizes that after he dies, nothing he does will have mattered because up to that point, he has lived just for himself.  So he decides that good life consists in living for other people and things (ideals and such).
cxDbdhELaa	I always look for a consistent rhyming scheme, which I prefer, and this poem doesn't have.  It's not necessarily a requirement, but it's a sign of talent if you can create it.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I tend to think that the abundant use of "The"s helps to otherwise give the poem some rhythm it lacks from having blank verse.|`|ZsCAXId7aa	First, the repetition of those "the" is quite annoying and rejects the reader - try to take few of them out. The poem is very descriptive and I like that, nice imagery but you need some more action. Try to organize the verbs that create the action - you just point out the frames, but what happens nearby?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Which is better than being too 'caught up' in it. Life only sucks if you take it seriously.<br>  <br>  Things that make it good for me are:<br>  1) Falling in love<br>  2) My friends<br>  3) Art, music, drawing, dance<br>  4) Food. Oh. My.

Using this as a casus belli, the US sent troops to South Vietnam to fight the Northern Communists (backed by China).|`|AA10912074	I think captn jc is somewhat right.  <br>  <br>  The Gulf of Tonkin incident did signal the start of the huge commitment of the US to the war effort.  I don't believe there is any doubt that the first incident involving a US destroyer actually happened.  It was the second incident, in which radar indicated that vessels were approaching the destroyer and the destroyer opened fire, which is now believed to have never happened.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	The Vietnam War started in 1945 when the Vietnamese declared themselves independent. France, having just regained its own sovereignty in Europe, still considered Vietnam (then called Indochina) to be a colony. Over the next nine years, it became increasingly clear that France did not have the resources or the ability to successfully retake the colony. In 1954, after the humiliating French defeat at the siege of Dien Bien Phu, France agreed to pull out and Vietnam was temporarily split in two, with its fate decided by an election two years later.<br>  <br>  In the last two years of the war, the US got involved in the conflict. Actually, they had been involved for a while, because France was using part of the money provided by the Marshall Plan, the American fund to rebuild Europe, to pay for the war. At any rate, the US began to see the events in Vietnam as part of the Cold War, since the main forces fighting against the French were Communists. As early as 1952, they were giving supplies and training personnel to the French and Vietnamese, and were setting up an alliance with anti-Communist leaders in Thailand. <br>  <br>  When time came for the elections, the leader of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, refused to participate, believing that with US backing, he would be able to consolidate his control over his country. <br>  <br>  The leader of North Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, had always considered the division of the country to be temporary, and when South Vietnam refused to abide by the earlier agreement, started getting ready to continue the war. By 1959, the preparations were ready.<br>  <br>  The US, having already committed so much to keeping South Vietnam independent, was slowly draw in to provide more and more financial and military support, until it committed fully to war.<br>  <br>  The Gulf of Tonkin incident was the specific causus belli, but Johnson was looking for an excuse to launch all out war by that time. To say that's why it started is to ignore the more important events leading up to it.

His educational record was not very brilliant. In his early years he worked in the Swiss patent office. He mentions that he was not very interested in what he was doing at the patent office. Everyday travelling by tram he used to think about the speed of light and things travelling at the speed of light. He wrote his first paper on Special relativiy in 1905. In this paper he showed the consequence of assuming that the soeed of light was constant. It was this assumption that forced him to show that time was a dimension i.e. it could be considered with other three dimesions. He escaped from Germany and went to the USA. He was invited to  go to Princeton. He spent the rest of his life in the USA. Amongst his notable achievement was explenation of the photo electric effect. He is considered to be responsible for inducing  the American President at the time to decide to built an atomic bomb.
AYH2okOBaa	secondo me questa poesia spiega appieno lo stato d'animo ke era proprio di ttt gli intellettuali nel periodo della guerra. soprattt sn evocative due figure: la prima è "il piede straniero sopra il cuore" del secondo verso ke rikiama lo stato di oppressione ke può essere esteso all'umanità intera, e poi "la madre ke andava incontro al figlio crocifisso sul palo del telefono" ke secondo me sta a significare ke il progresso ke ttt quanti vantano nn porta sempre a buoni esiti, poikè è stato sviluppato soprattt nell'ambito della guerra e ora nn si fa diversamente. quindi questa poesia esprime un senso di assoluta impossibilità di esprimersi con forme artistike di qualsiasi genere in un periodo straziato dalle devastazioni, dalla miseria e dalla morte.<br>  <br>  <br>  scusa ma in 5 righe è difficile spiegare questa poesia, e mi sn contenuta ci vorrebbero 800 pagine x esprimere appieno il significato così profondo ke contiene.<br>  <br>  <br>  ciao

It was really entertaining because I learned some stuff about how the plays were originally performed such as that they held tiny scrolls to read their lines hence; "you're roll".|`|8kRRkDbPaa	yea i have heard of macbeth by shakespeare i read it im in 7th grade and its a good play though i prefer  others because some shakespeare can bore people to sleep|`|MM02IZFDaa	uhm....anyone who's ever done a show has, or is "HXC SHAKESPEAREIAN."|`|0KQUwBCQaa	ya i read it in high school about 4 years ago. and we also watched the movie..i liked it|`|nd6ymvJVaa	i've heard of macbeth but not macbeth did it...is it any good?|`|hnBueKXraa	i haven't<br>  what's it about?
1aUKhnQjaa	le blanc c'est la fleur de Lys , symbole de la  royauté , le rouge c'est le sang des révolutionnaires au XVIII è , et  le bleu c'est la république . Les républicains au XIXè était des socialiste (aujourd'hui c'est l'inverse) qui se battaient en bleu , voir les poilus pour preuve . <br>  <br>  La ville de Paris , c'est impossible la nation c'est pas seulement la commune .|`|xov3Euufaa	Le BLEU et le ROUGE sont les couleurs d'une très grande ville en France: PARIS<br>  (Le rouge représentant aussi la couleur des révolutionnaires puis, plus tard, celle des socialistes et des communistes, le drapeau est donc aussi symbolique d'une république qui reflète les tendances politiques des Fran?ais.) <br>  <br>  La troisième couleur, le BLANC, (représentant la pureté) est la couleur de grands personnages historiques fran?ais dont un a été guillotiné en 1793. C'est la couleur du ROI..<br>  <br>  Le drapeau fran?ais trouve son origine en 1789, lors de la révolution fran?aise. En effet, deux des trois couleurs qui composent aujourd’hui le drapeau fran?ais étaient alors réunies sous forme d’une cocarde. Cette cocarde était le signe distinctif de la garde municipale de Paris et était alors rouge et bleue. Trois jours après la prise de la bastille, le roi Louis XVI se rendit à Paris et la cocarde fut alors agrémentée de la couleur blanche, symbole de la monarchie. Les trois couleurs représentant la France étaient alors réunies.<br>  <br>  Cependant, une autre version de l’interprétation des trois couleurs ornant le drapeau fran?ais est envisagée.<br>  En effet : le bleu du drapeau fran?ais y est alors associé à Charlemagne et Saint-Martin, le rouge à Saint-Denis et le blanc à la royauté.|`|Itm7ycpPaa	L'origine des couleurs fait l'objet de plusieurs hypothèses: <br>              -Selon la plus répandue, le blanc, couleur du roi de France, est entouré des couleurs de la ville de Paris, le bleu et le rouge. Toutefois, au moment de la Révolution, la ville de Paris n'utilisait plus ces couleurs. Par ailleurs, l'ordre des couleurs a varié: rouge, bleu, blanc / blanc, rouge, bleu / bleu, blanc, rouge, etc. en bandes horizontales ou verticales. Cette hypothèse aurait été forgée au XIXème siècle. <br>            -Selon une autre hypothèse, émise, entre autres, par Michel Pastoureau, les couleurs bleu, blanc et rouge seraient les couleurs de l'indépendance américaine, synonymes de liberté, que Lafayette aurait ramenées en France. <br>           -Selon une troisième hypothèse, les couleurs du drapeau fran?ais auraient toujours été présentes en France à travers des livrées royales, des bannières, des uniformes, etc. depuis plusieurs siècles. Il est possible qu'à la Révolution, de royales, ces couleurs soient devenues celles de la Nation selon le principe d'égalité.|`|NUY35vmwaa	le bleu c'est la mer ; le blanc la paix et le rouge, la passion|`|f2f764ce90e27fbacf302af1fc7eb959aa	Oui il existe des divergences<br>  Il existe un fait au lendemain de la prise de la Bastille Louis XVI est venu à Paris et semble avoir re?u la célèbre cocarde bleu, blanc rouge  des mains du nouveau maire de Paris Bailly et à cette date, les deux couleurs de la ville de Paris (lieu de la prise de la Bastille) avec un centre le blanc royal, symbolisait bien l'union du Roi et de son "Bon Peuple de Paris"<br>  Nous voyons ensuite ce drapeau brandi par les armées révolutionnaires.<br>  Ce drapeau est redevenu emblème national en 1830 et si après 1870 il n'y a pas eu de restauration monarchique c'est parce que le compte de Chambord exigeait le drapeau blanc, à sa mort la question de la proclamation de la monarchie n'était plus d'actualité<br>  Je m'en tiendrai donc aux faits historiques incontestables|`|aa8320f3ec4479d8ae69f07ed1ce1d01aa	<a href="http://pagesperso-orange.fr/patrice.talvast/drapeau.html" rel="nofollow">http://pagesperso-orange.fr/patrice.talv...</a><br>  Bleu : la chape de St Martin levée par Clovis<br>  Blanc : l'étendard de Jeanne d'Arc au Sacre de Reims<br>  Rouge : l'oriflamme de St Denis, protecteur de la France<br>  <br>  Je ne savais pas non plus...merci de ta question qui m'a fait chercher.|`|aoLjuLAbaa	Une chose est sure, leur signification n'a plus trop de rapprot avec la France actuelle.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	To diffuse tensions between clerics and knights... the two groups with POWER in the Middle Ages who, by profession, are polar opposites.<br>  <br>  Pope Urban II was aware that the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (a Christian Emperor) was threatened by the Islamic Turks... who just happened to also control the Holy Land.<br>  <br>  SO... the POPE (Urban II) calls for a wresting of the Holy Land from the Muslim Armies.  This gets the KNIGHTS out of the area and doing what they do BEST: Fighting.  It strengthens The Roman Church. And it solves the infighting in "Christendom" (what we'd call Europe).<br>  <br>  NOTE that the Crusades were NOT called that until centuries later.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Christian one-upmanship, which failed. They wanted to 'reclaim' Jerusalem. Or, they were under employed poor little rich kids out for adventure and they also killed Jews during their jouneys overland across Europe.|`|Q5OEbSBcaa	Ostensibly, they were to capture the holy land from Muslim empires so that European pilgrims could safely travel to and from the holy sites of Christianity.  Along the way, they transformed into a means of the church asserting political control over the various kingdoms and independent duchies of Europe, a way for the church to control religious orthodoxy (particularly violent crusades were launched against heretics in what are today southern France and the coastal regions of Poland), and a way for kings to relieve the pressure of a growing class of nobility competing for land and prestige.  (Too many sons of barons and dukes wandering around your kingdom, trying to carve out empires for themselves?  Send them off to Jerusalem to fight the infidel!)|`|7aszGuMGaa	To recapture the holy sites and put them in Christan hands.  Also it was to make mad money and to try to keep the muslims at bay because they were invading spain, southern france and the byzantine empire.|`|8a2c7511cfabb2e759e39cfc0b3a6c82aa	Supposedly to get back the land to the Christians (Holy Land) but it also turned out thay were after the treasure of Solomon's temple|`|d4de6513a956918c9e1aeaeb652c210faa	that depends on which one you want to know about.  there was more than one "crusade" in history.
AA11931783	no language are not need for communicate<br>  face especially eyes is the better medium for communicate thru ur face u can show all ur feeling ur love ur sadness ur angryness and all|`|w2qV8WEmaa	No. Language is created to reduce misunderstanding created by body language ;-p<br>  <br>  Example. You scratch your butt when people ask you how you feel about them. You feel like been biten by mosquito in the butt, but the other party may thinks that you think that they are a pain in the butt. |`|rgFbgliYaa	Body language is a majority of our communication, but offering "change back or round up for charity?" at the local supermarket may be hard to nudge.|`|a32c0c10bc2fe2362e45ee5171d637b4aa	Sometimes! ; ) <br>  <br>  A hug ... a kiss ... an act of lovemaking .... are sometimes far more powerful communicators than words.<br>  <br>  But a word without words would be boring, too. We need both, to stimulate both our hearts and our minds.|`|RBp3Wzelaa	This is possible but I don't think the communication would be better, as a matter of general purpose. There are some cases where actions speak louder than words. It's also true that for two persons not speaking the same language, there can be common traits helping communication like music or sports. |`|NZxeCLG0aa	not really because through language is how we spread culture and without our culture humans would be like animals|`|BYVr1tOGaa	.......|`|d7rOO1Zwaa	No.<br>  Otherwise, we would not have developed language in the process of our evolution.<br>  <br>  Yes, in science-FICTION we may have moved beyond language.

cxXU2748aa	After Dumbledore's death, Harry plans to destroy the parts of Voldemort's soul which are hidden in the four remaining Horcruxes: the locket, Hufflepuff's cup, the Diadem of Ravenclaw, and the snake, Nagini. When the Ministry falls to Voldemort, Harry, Ron, and Hermione go into hiding, apparating from place to place every few days. Together, they find two Horcruxes, and find the symbol, and discover the meaning, of the Deathly Hallows, three magical objects that allow the posessor to become the master of death. Harry believes that this is the way to defeat Voldemort: Hallows versus Horcruxes, but Ron and Hermione, who do not believe the story of the Hallows, convince Harry to continue searching for the Horcruxes. After finding and destroying the remaining Horcruxes, Harry and Voldemort face off at Hogwarts Castle, and Harry triumphs. The epilogue of the book shows how Harry marries Ginny, and Ron marries Hermione, and a brief glimpse into their lives after the death of Tom Riddle.<br>  <br>  Short and sweet description, hope it works.|`|UYA1vrNPaa	Dude, read it.<br>  <br>  I waited patiently (...well, sorta) for years to find out what happened in that book.|`|VSFvJ3praa	There was a LOT of stuff that happened in that book....<br>  <br>  Harry, Ron, and Hemione run around finding Horcruxes. Harry gets killed by Moldy, then comes back to life and kills Moldy.
nIGKwfAQaa	Look for:<br>  <br>  Alliteration - Words that begin with the same consonant sound. (Sally skipped in small circles.)<br>  <br>  Metaphors/Similies - Comparison between two words. Similies use like or as, metaphors DO NOT. (The dog is like a bear/ The dog is a bear.)<br>  <br>  Personification - Using human-like qualities in non-human things. (The chair groaned as the person sat in it.)<br>  <br>  These are the four main types of figurative language I've learned. Good luck!
