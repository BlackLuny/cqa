AA11081090	let her lie and rise above it. the kids know so dont worry about it.    Be the better person    Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|1eb4cfee6608bafc0a56dc12fcb4dce7aa	Yes unfortunately, if its troubling you, you guys should have an open enough relationship to discuss what ever might be bothering you. but for the kids, try to be as nice to each other as possible, let her know how you feel without disrespecting her. she  seems to be a good person, with a very big problem. HONESTY.   GOOD LUCK.|`|AA12244075	Yes you need to call her on it, or else you kids will end up learning the behavior. My mom was the same way, and she had the nerve when confronted with her lies, to say she never lies, and then she would beat us for suggesting that she lied. You need to call her out on it, preferably in front of the kids so she knows, and they know you are not stupid, and it won't happen when you are around.|`|AA12067444	Yes, call her out on it - she's raising your kids too. Our habits good and bad our kids pick up on. By her doing it its going to teach the kids its okay to lie, and lets face it no child is 100% honest as is. No need to make it worse. Young or not kids arent dumb - they will eventually see through it, but that wont happen until theyre in their teenage years. Manipulation can only get you so far in life.......|`|AA11733271	MY THOUGHTS ARE . YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER EX OR NOT . EVERY TIME SHE LIES TO YOU -CALL HER ON IT .
mAqohMxyaa	In South Padre Island I recommend checking Peninsula Island Resort.  I agree though, that you can go on a nice Carribean Cruise.  There is a port in Galveston, you can check them out here http://www.galvestoncruises.com/|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	I can't choose a place for you, but whatever you don't build it up and stress madly over it or you will be disappointed. Don't scrutinise every microscopic detail or you will never find anywhere you think is good enough. Good Luck and have a lovely time, the company is the most important thing, right?|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Chances are you'll love where ever you pick.  The honeymoon is more about spending time with your new spouce, you probably wont even be out of the hotel room too much ;)|`|IUgkylWqaa	How much is your budget?   A 7 day western Caribbean cruise out of Galveston is around $1700  Or take a 5 day cruise that would be less expensive.  You can do so much more on the ship and visit a couple of different place with an awesome beaches.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I used to live in Tx.  I've never been to Galveston, but my friend went for her honeymoon and had a lot of fun.  I'm sure you can find a few neat resorts/hotels there and it's close to the beach too!
ifgzHzA3aa	Don't be "that" person.  Go, make adult conversation and have fun.  You'll be surprised, people are usually very welcoming to people who are new to the group.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	No, I think it would be quite inappropriate to bring or invite someone along with you to any occasion unless it states so in the invite.  It is uncomfortable in these situations where you do not know most of the people, but look at it in a different way - it is a great chance to get to meet new people.  You are going there in support of the bride just as everyone else there is.  If you were to bring another person along it would come across as rude and immature.  Just go, mingle for a while, and after all of the "festivities" are over, if you are still feeling uncomfortable, you can leave.  I think you'll be surprised as to how comfortable you'll end up feeling in the end.  Going to uncomfortable obligations is a part of life, we all have to do it at some point or another.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	No.  Just because it's at someone's house doesn't give you the license to bring people along.  It's not really a casual house party, but a bridal shower.    Suck it up and go and you'll be surprised at how friendly people can be.|`|QNjJcveLaa	well, before you do bring your friend to the bridal shower, I think it would be best if you went ahead and asked the the bride and groom, just to be on the safe side.  If you bring an unwelcome guest to the shower, a lot may go wrong. there could be fighting and that's never a good thing, especially at a bridal shower. it's just my opinion, but better safe that sorry. Good Luck.|`|wdmp9eYXaa	it would be rude for you to bring a friend that was not invited and unknown to the bride. if you feel that you cannot go due to the fact that you don't know  most of the people there then tell whoever is giving the shower that you are unable to go because going where you hardly know anyone is difficult for you to do. calling and asking if you can bring someone would be even more rude. so my advice is to just not go. if the bride asks you why you weren't there then tell her the truth.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no no no, that's the height of rudeness.  the bride and her family don't want strangers around during an intimate event like a shower or the wedding.  there will be food there and your friend will be an extra mouth to feed, so yes there is a cost involved.  even if your friend doesn't eat, it's very gauche to bring someone who is not invited, and it would be awkward for someone to sit and not eat while everyone else does.  I personally hate showers and make up any excuse not to go, unless I know a ton of people who will be there, have known them at least half my life, and have an assurance there will be wine present.|`|1e4385b333fdc39a5947962d4e029837aa	No not if your friend was not invited..|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Don't bring anyone else. If you really want to, ask ahead of time. They may have things planned for each guest, and if someone "extra" comes, it may throw everything off.|`|hkwBR1moaa	No, you should not bring a friend.  They invited you, not you and a guest.|`|15cfc4d36ea2cf904bfa34f5a737334caa	Unless the invite said "and guest" then absolutely NOT!  It is just plain rude to do so.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	No thats rude. Id be mad because its a private kind of thing.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	If the invitation states only your name, then ask the host, which I'm assuming would be the Maid of Honor and see if she is ok with adding one more person.    Doesn't hurt to ask :)|`|76nTvO4iaa	Absolutely not.
mvKDbb2uaa	Hawaii is gorgeous, but I like Greece--absolutely wonderful.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	The prettiest is so subjective.  I absolutely love the Caribbean.  I love being in a bathing suit and heat.  The hot sun beating down on a gorgeous beach and crystal clear water.  That to me is bliss.  The perfect state of mind.    However I don't necessarily think that is the prettiest.  I think I'll give that to Europe.  Greece or France.  Gorgeous.  France is nice b/c each day you can see something completely different.  Paris is very different than the Rivera which is very different than the wine areas.  Greece is nice b/c the houses are so white and beautiful.  The ancient Greek temples that are still standing are like one of the Wonders of the World.  And the food.  Oh the food.    Then again I love the mountains.  Czech, Austria, Swiss Alps.  Gorgeous areas and the mountains are so pretty.  They are so different than our mountains (I live near the Appalachians) and many of the tourist areas have been very smart and kept a bit of their "uniqueness".  The global economy has made a lot of places universal.  McDonald's everywhere and the same businesses on every street.  But some of these areas have really kept up with what made Switzerland Swiss.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Bora Bora  Tahiti  Hawaii|`|4zUdmmNRaa	Niagara Falls.|`|4POGapREaa	I think it just depends on what your interests are in general.  Some people like more art & culture, some people just want to relax on the beach.  We honeymooned in Hawaii (Maui) and it was perfect for us.  We're both major sun lovers & we live by the beach as it is so it just really suited our lifestyle.  The second we arrived home we wanted to start planning our next trip there.|`|hYJLs2NDaa	Tikehau in French Polynesia|`|pot8KTTyaa	hawaii|`|CM1dfztQaa	Spain, Italy, or Ireland. I've always wanted to see those places and would love to share them with my honey.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Greece.  I want to go back.  The islands of Rhodes and Patmos are incredible.
r1D9P4Vyaa	This is a Tough pickle you are in...It probably is not what you are going to hear but here goes. If I were you I would still try to have a relation with Your Mom still, After all she is Your Mom, some of the thing she does you may/will not agree with but that is not your choice, It`s hers. She just sounds like she does care a lot about helping people, even if they are Losers, she likes it, But if someone started to take advantage of her, Say money wise, then I would step in and say something. As far as the nanny sister, well, the apple does fall far from the tree, ( your mom). She sounds like your mom. You sound like the logical one. If the others don`t see it this way, so be it. So all I can suggest is please try to at least STAY CLOSE to your MOM and try not to get your emotions to much involved.   God Bless!.....Be Strong!
wMWfCjBpaa	How about pictures of you and the groom at a certain age per table number. Like for table 8, pictures when you two were 8 years old in a cute frame. Instead of regular numbers, I like roman numerals.     I was thinking of doing that or using cities names of where we want to visit or already have. I have 40 tables so we'll see what happens =)|`|xHKRGEg4aa	name cards, obviously & you can tell people ahead of time where they will be seated.  You could use other things than numbers.  Or you could set up a color coordinated map so they would know.  Otherwise you would really have to ask people that already know to show them where to sit.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	use 25 different photos of yourself and the groom!  display a 5x7 or 8x10 on each table maybe as part of the centerpiece, and then on each place card put a small thumbnail sized pic on there.  make up a little sign to put on the table where the place cards go to let people know to match up the photo on the place card wtih the one on the table for their seat assignment.|`|ZsU6EKWPaa	You cold have a certain picture instead of the numbers, but it all might get a bit confusing.    Or a person at the door who tells everyone what table theyre at    x|`|CM1dfztQaa	You could do something fun like giving each table a destination name. Like, Paris, Athens, and Madrid.

It was really sweet! :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I've seen people do a few things...    *Street Names  *Love Songs  *Movie Titles  *Quotes    Think of something meaningful between the two of you... Even if no one else understands...  Whether it be a certain date, or a "phrase/word" you guys use, etc.  :)|`|4wRVxL6Xaa	I think numbering/lettering is one the easiest thing but you can probably display the whole layout and put the number on the map so when they enter, they know where to go.     Or depending on what type of centerpieces you have, you can use that as well if it's all different color, shape, design etc. I think the easiest is to have a map when they enter or have someone escort them to the tables.. (usher?)|`|3SSVBJAqaa	You can use names of trees, flowers, countries, old hollywood stars, etc. instead of numbers. All depending on your theme, if you have one.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Depending if you have a theme... a friend of mine put a name of a movie.  or it could be a car  or a flower  or a color.|`|qtAOHZ0Daa	You could use different words that relate to marriage. ie, love, forever, joy, eternity, happiness.

i4ceTwqLaa	My list is:    Cheating on me  Hitting me or the children  Stealing from me  Being a criminal (not like, speeding tickets...more severe stuff)  Being an addict  Refusing to contribute by way of either employment or looking after the household    I'd LIKE to say "repeated verbal abuse", but darn it, I can't think of a single person I love (or myself for that matter) that has NOT repeatedly said things that have hurt my feelings - I guess this one's not really on my list then, unless it was coupled with other types of abuse or alienation, or was continuous.|`|izbAdDUraa	creepy. i think you read my mind. i was thinking about this last night.. obviously, cheating, or harming my son would be number one, or physical abuse.. but something that would hurt me deeply would be if he ever told me i was unattractive (ugly, fat etc). it would absolutely kill me. its bad enough i find myself to be hideous, i couldn't imagine what it would feel like if the ONE person in the world who finds me attractive, all of the sudden didn't anymore. i would just have to leave.. i dont think you can become attractive to someone once you're not. if that makes sense?!  :[|`|ev33OxJbaa	Love is about forgiving and forgetting things.

g8U6NthEaa	haha funny story. funny, but true sometimes. personally, i would NEEVR get a sex change, it seems gross... however, i am for sex changes, gay marriage, and everything else like that because not that i personally agree with it, but i beleive that evryone has the right to become whatever person they want to be,and i personally dont  know how a person who has had a sex change has gone through-some day that they just dont feel right in the body they are in.....which is valid, so i say yes its ok to get a sex change-people should be able to change whatever they want about themselvess....in our society today. i mean, ask yourself this, why can you change your nose, get booob inplants, but not change your vag to a penis? or the other way around? its just another body part! and its not fair to descriminate!!!!!!!|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Who cares.

If all addicts could stop based for their love of their children or family, there would be hardly any addicts at all, would there?

If you cannot see any reason to stop drinking other than that it would get your wife off your back, I'm afraid your battle is already lost.    I hate to say it, but, there are more failures than success stories when it comes to drinking.

You made a huge mistake by promising something you couldn't do. If you really can't stop drinking that much, you probably shouldn't be raising children.     You are only 23 and have a full life ahead of you, so why in the world would you be wasting your life and your marriage and your children's trust on something like excessive alcohol consumption.    And on a final note, why are you drinking so much alcohol during this economic downturn?? If you injure yourself and have to go to the hospital, who is going to take care of your family? Drinking (and the repercussions of drinking like injuries) can be expensive.    You are in the grownup world now, start behaving accordingly.|`|UNZuciedaa	have a few more and you'll forget all about it|`|hTQPF2xBaa	Something unexpected.

DO not forget to say sorry and really mean it.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	drink up, you only live once|`|j5k0VRbPaa	wowow you guys are young to young wow wel ur wife is young i say seek a therapist|`|E3yOmel9aa	You have kids, a wife and a drinking problem? Figure out which one does not belong.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Well, grow up, and do it fast.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	If you are serious about repairing the marriage and want to stop drinking then you need to join AA. And you need to involve her in it with you. Both of you attend meetings so she can see how committed you are to this. I don't understand though why she wanted to spend alone time with your kids? That doesn't make sense really. Could they not have gone to a movie or something? Maybe there are issues way deeper than your drinking here. If nothing else, do it for your children. You are screwing up their lives and you might not realize it yet. They need you full time sober. And it sounds like your wife does too.|`|BUET39wmaa	so many children having children.    why is everyone in such a hurry to grow up these days?|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	quit drinking like you've promised before you lose her.  been there, done that...believe me, she WILL leave eventually.  took me 10 yrs, but you bet i finally had enough!!
rcut6bhoaa	Just dont do it!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Honestly, I would suggest not to do it at all.  But, if you feel you must, DO NOT do it with someone you hang out with.  Meet someone new specifically for this reason, someone you can get out of your lives as quickly as they came in if needed, and someone who doesn't know any of the same people as you. I also wouldn't suggest telling any of your friends if you go through with it.|`|BUET39wmaa	DON'T do it with your friend.    look for a local swingers website or ashleymadison type of site to find someone|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Try adultfriendfinder.com|`|DytsjZKpaa	you are exactly right. never do it with someone you know. my wife and i are into 3somes and we have never invited a friend. 6 years now and we have never had a problem.|`|a70231ccec5d44c2d21f177c98496f1baa	don't do it...its would be cheating on you and you are there...|`|wZtDLjO8aa	I will tell you my experience. I just had a 3 some recently.  Well it was suppose to be a 3 some, but it ended up a twosome. I really got into the guy that we invited. So you know, I had only been with the other guy for 6 months. Well I ended up thinking i wanted to be with this other guy and actually told my bf that. Well you know how the story goes, the 3rd wasn't so interested in me as it turned out. I guess we just got real caught up the in the moment.  So, my advice, if you are going to do it you have to have rules and follow them to the tee. I would suggest no kissing, its way to personal. There also should be not contact beforehand, ie: texting, phone or email. And last, it should be someone that lives far, far away.  If you can do all these things you should have lots of kinky fun.
CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Beautiful!    How about an Addam's Family theme?    Gomez, Morticia, Lurch, Cousin It, Thing, Pugsley, Wednesday, Uncle Fester and so on.    Have the wedding in a castle. Think of all the cool decorating ideas!    What do you think?    John H    P.S. I love the Addam's Family. Even got to work with T.V.s Gomez, John Astin, an incredibly wonderful man!|`|MLvwZ7uAaa	That is so cool! I always thought that Halloween weddings were such a great idea! Ok, if you google "The Pyramid Collection," you should be able to sign up for their catolgues, and they have they greatest selection of old style clothing/rennesance + medeval clothing ever. Good luck! -Lola P.|`|2ONtnHbJaa	Honestly, I think that would be amazing. I wanted to do something like that for my wedding but my husband didn't agree with it. I wanted me and my husband to be vampires and all the couples had to be something together. Hope you have a great wedding though.|`|KkrfpWn9aa	have you ever seen labyrinth? it's a movie with david bowie and it has a fabulous masquerade ball scene. that scene is sure to inspire you! for sure check it out!  here's the link  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi1A9s6WT...|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	well, theme weddings can get kinda pricey (costume rentals and such) so maybe try to just do like a darker kinda theme? so people dont nessecarily have to go out and get themed dresses, but they can get darker ones that still fit the halloweenish theme?      you could also do jackolanterns for centerpieces....or find tall creepy looking candleabras...       um.....it would be the PERFECT wedding to have a candy bar at.  like, all sorts of jars filled with halloween type candies that guests can pick their faves and take them home.      check out maggie sottero, she has loads of dresses that come in differant colors so you could maybe find a dark red or even black one if you want.  if you dont want a COMPLETLY colored dress, davids bridal has a lot of dresses where you can pick the accent color, including  http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...  that one (the picture doesnt do it justice, and i have seen it with black details as well)      the guys could have skull and crossbones cufflinks    oh oh oh! check out the website offbeatbride.com.  yeah, LOADS of cool ideas on there.  love that site|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I think it's a pretty cool idea, but I would recommend doing it the week of halloween instead of on Oct 31st.  If you were planning on having any children at the wedding they will certainly resent missing out on the greatest day of the year for kids.  If you are having any parents with young children attending they will miss out on getting to take there kids out trick or treating or they will be unable to attend your wedding.  Some people also really like handing out candy at night.    I think it's a great idea, just make it close to the 31st but not actually on it.  I personally also wouldn't want every halloween to be my aniversery, I'd rather have a day for my aniversery and a day for halloween.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no no no, what are you in Jr high?  the theme of a wedding is marriage and marriage only, you don't need anything else stealing focus from the reason for the event.  if you want to throw a halloween party, do that separate from your wedding.  think of your photos!  they will look so tacky when you look back at them in 10 years.  you only get one wedding God willing, so do it right.|`|15cfc4d36ea2cf904bfa34f5a737334caa	I just saw a wedding like this on TV.  I believe they were both vampire like...she had a really nice wedding dress but in black I think.  His groomsmen carried him in by coffin.  The brides maids were either in red dresses with black laced hooded capes or vice versa I can't remember.  Guests had to dress up in costume.  I even think their minister dressed up like a clown or something.  You may want to google it and see if you can find it.  I'm a huge halloween nut so I think this is an awesome idea.|`|ooHqdfPEaa	OK. If you really want to go Halloweeny what if you do like a corpse bride, thing? I know its odd, but that is kinda the point isn't it?  If that's too creepy, than your Masquerade ball would be good. Also a Cinderella ball would be nice. I'll add a link. Oh, this wedding is gonna be fun, isn't it? Good Luck!
RDWVoc9Naa	just when u look at them and think there is none in the world that can replace him, no matter how annoying he can be, or how smelly his farts are u love everything about them and see nothing but the future in there eyes....|`|xHKRGEg4aa	For the first time in my life I was able to be around someone & be completely comfortable with him, no matter what. I've never felt the way I feel for him. I cant imagine my life without him in it. He puts up with all my crap, & I can handle his & it not be a problem at all. Everytime I hear his voice, or his name, or get a text msg, anything, I get butterflies & all breathless, kind of a free-fall feeling.  |`|ECe1rgsdaa	It was the simple fact that I couldn't imagine my life without him and that that feeling lasted more than 6 months. I still feel the same way after 4.5 years of being together. :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	ive known my fiance since second grade.  we FINALLY started dating when we were both 19.  i knew about a week into the relationship that we were going to end up married when he would come over at like, three in the afternoon and we stayed up till like, five in the morning just talking. we're 22 now and so excited that we finally get to be married in august|`|4POGapREaa	I had just come out of a hideous relationship that completely drained me.  The second I met my husband, he just felt like home to me.  It was weird almost, like I felt like I could breathe again.  I did not want to get into a relationship of any kind at that moment but there was no way I could pass up something I was so certain about.  On our first date, we laughed a lot, we talked a lot, we told each other about our lives, he was polite, he was funny, he pulled out my chair, he ordered for me, he was kind to our waiters, he was sincere.  It was the first time ever that I felt like I was with someone who was just simply being himself.  No rock star wanna be, no cool dude routine, no pretentiousness.  I just knew.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	I didn't know my now husband all that well, but I kept having the strong feeling we were supposed to be married.  The feeling kept getting stronger, so I asked him out.  We hit it off amazingly well on our first date, and that feeling not only got even stronger, but now he had it too.  :-)|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Gradually getting to know him convinced me that we would be good together.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I didn't know and shouldn't have married him.|`|6s7g3X0maa	well we have been through a lot in the past 2 years and to be making it this far says a lot. I think god put us through all of this to prepare us for marriage. and so here it is we're getting married in may
RF2YV9ataa	i suggest hitting up the virtual phonebook and reading unbiased reviews of divorce attorneys in your area.  Before i give anyone a try i always read their reviews and check their case history.  I know it sounds like alot of work but in the end, isnt getting the job done with the least amount of stress possible worth it?  of course it is!  Just dont settle for billboard or tv ads cuz those guys can be misleading.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Hey, Buddysmomma!  Don't know any good divorce attorneys.  Sorry.  Just wanted to let you know that I'm in Statesboro, GA, right down Highway 25 from you!  Small world!  Hope you find one though.  Good luck!
HfHvF4Vkaa	If neither one of you say anything , all should go thru ok.   Good luck for a new and happy life coming ......|`|TOnq6w6Baa	I was told that these things don't really matter.  I myself am going thru a divorce and he put down a lot wrong info but the paralegal told me it didn't make any difference.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	Then don't bring these things to the courts attention.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Talk to an attorney...errors in legal documents COULD affect their validity.  This is why you should NEVER try to be your own attorney.|`|BlVudiyfaa	naw, just tell the Judge she was a moron.|`|3zmC8AuDaa	The main thing is that he doesn't want the divorce. He even asked me today if there were any mistakes in it.
286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	If I were you I'd take this as a learning experience and tell yourself this is what you DON'T want.    All marriages have good and bad...But they don't have to be more bad than good.|`|7b105c20abc8cb7babb72ce9a68a74daaa	Mine is as good as it gets, my parents divorced when i was a teen my dad did the same thing, my mom got the best revenge out there she married a man who adores her and is filthy rich.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	"And why do people cheat if their spouse loves them?"    Obviously they don't love their spouse.  Not everyone you love will love you back.      But there are good relationships out there. Just pick a good person, and be a good person yourself.|`|BUET39wmaa	listen marriage is constant work and some people don't want to put in the effort.    marriage can be very rewarding as long as you are true to yourself and your partner and don't change the way you treat them as time goes on|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes, there is such thing as a happy marriage. your parents just chose to stick it out for your benefit, but in reality it just made you lose faith in happiness. i don't know why people cheat when they have a loving spouse at home. i've been cheated on by every person i've ever dated, except my current relationship with my fiance. it taught me a lot about myself and relationships, but i never let it affect the faith that i had in marriage.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	you wont understand until you are at least in a serious relationship!!! marriages are not united to suffer, cheat and cause pain!! its to love and endure and enjoy each other!!  you will understand when you get married or love someone so much that you will want to marry them, even with your parents bad examples (of marriage).|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	The only people who would be able to tell you if any marriage stay happy forever are old people who have been married forever.  I think it can happen and I have hope for the future, but I haven't seen it either.  I've been married for 6 1/2 years and so far it's been more good than bad.  There have been plenty of bad times, but also plenty of great times.  The thing that has worked best with us has been not going to bed mad.  If we have a disagreement then we talk it to death until we solve the problem.  If you know from day 1 the relationship sucks, then you get out of it.  Since you haven't dated yet, just be careful.  It's really easy to fall in love with the first guy who's nice to you.  I didn't date in school either and I thought I was in love a few times, even with some jerks, before I found my husband.  Just don't rush it and you'll be fine.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Good marriages are everywhere.  All relationships DON'T suck.|`|fGE7hL12aa	Mine has been pretty good. We've been together fo 25 years.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Yes there actually are some great marriages out there . It all depends on who you pick for a partner .|`|W1rCsvTzaa	My marriage is great including the sex part.  As for cheating.  Sometimes people are not sexually compatible.  Some women starve their men of sex.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Mine has been great..We have been happily married 18 yrs.|`|wKzH60Xlaa	Yes, believe it or not there ARE good marriages.    Marriages take work; a lot of work.  It's a commitment from the beginning. Often times people don't "feel" like they're in love anymore after so many years but I've learned that marriage is not always a feeling, it's a commitment.  That's when people use divorce for.  In order to get that feeling back, you need to work at it.  Learn from your parents and decide yours will be different.  Good luck!|`|dItZAwI2aa	young lady, first off your mother should be sat down and had life explained to her...here's what u say she said:    "My mom said their marriage sucked from day 1."    weren't you born someplace inbetween their marriage and their now pending divorce? your mom should watch her "p's" and "q's" while making comments like that.    my parents were married 43yrs...my dad was 11yrs older than my mom...they'd still be married if he hadn't passed away.    there are many millions of marriages that are happy, loving ones that don't end up in divorce.  perhaps ur mom should explain to u y if it was so bad from day 1 she stayed....all this time. me thinks ur mom loves and has a flair for the dramatic.    since i never cheated i can't tell u y people cheat on the ones they love other than what u experience in school right now called "peer pressure"...look at most if not all of the questions here on YA! in the marriage and divorce section that discuss cheating...many if not all answerers tell the person to "go for it".    your parents are going thru something that according to statistics only 50% of marriages go thru...that leaves the other 50% that are good...lets start focusing on that, shall we.    good luck and GOD bless.|`|0hR5hMquaa	Well my grandparents just had their 50th anniversary, my parents just had their 25th and my husband and I are about to have our 5th and couldn't be any happier. We went through out tough times as well but it only made us stronger...so I believe that it depends on the people...If they have the mind set that this horrible thing they are going through is going to ruin their marriage. then it will. But People who have the mind set that this horrible thing they are going through will get worked out and you will both learn from it ...then it will make the marriage stronger.    Never have cheated and neither has hubby. I have never even been tempted. And can't imagine that I ever will.|`|0bqTHTnDaa	There are lots of good marriages.  The first thing to remember is it is always about give and take and compromise.  I've been married to my husband (second) for almost 2 years now, and I can't imagine life without him.  But, we were both married before, and both of us learned alot about how to make a marriage work.  Number one is trust.  He is my best friend and I am his, and when something is going on we are the first person each other calls, to share both good and bad news.  We communicate and work out our differences. and, we love each other.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	There ARE good marriages out there!!  I have one.  My brother has one.  My sister has one.  My parents have one.  My grandparents have one.  Love is a choice.  As long as you BOTH choose to put each other as a priority in your life and work through your problems, it can be amazingly happy and wonderful!  Have you seen Fireproof?!  You should!!  It shows that even tough times can be overcome, but it's a choice, it's not just about feelings.  And a marriage should be about 3 people- you, him, and God.  Just make sure you find a guy that respects you and is in it for the long haul.  Don't get married expecting to get divorced if something goes wrong.|`|S9200kOcaa	Yes there are good marriages.  I am fortunate for I have had many family members that have had great loving marriages.  I have many friends that have great marriages also.  I do have a few friends that have had bad marriages too.      My marriage is wonderful and that is saying very little about it.  It can not be better for we both love each other deeply and everyday is better than the last.  We have known each other since 1961.  I will tell you there are bad days and things we go through but we are very honest with one another and no matter what happens we both Love each other.  At the end of any problem no matter how bad  we love each other.  Most arguments are dumb and we have been able to move on.      I will tell you this.  One needs to respect their mate and she needs to respect you.  No bad language or hurtfully words to be said to one another.  Those words can only make thing worse so cool down and think before you speak.  Show her you love her.      My friends disrespect their wife or women in general I dont and I do not play along with them.  I only do what is right for me.  Not what I believe my friends would like to hear just for a laugh or be cool.  The only person I need to be cool with is my wife.  She is the only one I care to make 100% happy day and night.    So yes there is good marriages out there.  Do not let your situation convert you into treating women different and do not go with the crowd.  Do what ever you can to make your mate happy.  She will in turn make you happy.  Oh and yes take your time picking a mate.  I will say that one should not marry until the age of 28 to 30 and really know their mate.|`|KstxPYPTaa	There's a lot of feel good answers on here but I will give you some honest answers/advice.        Remember this if someone really loves you he or she will not cheat period. It will not happen. The problem with marriage I believe is it's hard to maintain the same passion from day one to year 5. Things change you don't have the same appreciation for each other kinda take people for granted.      I really believe there are other factors such as personal health, finances ect. that all can put pressure on it as well.  It can be really great. I've been married 13 years we've had ups and downs. But I truly believe that it gets a little stronger through adversity. You can bring down a building in one day but it may take months or weeks to build.         Whatever you do do not get married young. Young to me is 23ish. You will start to see things a little different in your early 20s.
inuecfP7aa	I'm a lot better looking than my mans wife in the face ,breast and i don't have a fat cottage cheese azz like her, he's leaving her for me in may of this year right after his youngest graduate high school.    He says I'm much tighter to if you know what i mean.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	No, but he damn sure treated me a lot better.  My ex was an alcoholic, abusive a hole.  Glad I finally got enough sense to get out of that relationship.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	didn't go through with it but the temptation was largely related to looks.  He was mmmmm.... good.|`|0Id85yiYaa	when my exes cheated, it was always with someone uglier.|`|7foornMVaa	If I cheat, which will never happen, I will pick a much better looking man.  Hard to do since mine is the best looking man to me.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	cheating is mostly always with less attractive people, but you develop a relationship that you can perfectly have with your husband except without the stress of the relationship... just mellow friendship that leads to more...  that being said, women who cheat are hardly ever drawn to a man just for sex women dont primarily seek physical fulfillment but emotional love...|`|AA11796667	No I cheated with someone who gave me love and faithfulness someone who was true to me. It just so happen he was not as good lucking as my husband but at the time I needed real not good looks.|`|u7f0QB37aa	No they will say he was more sensitive.|`|W14VytAdaa	it's never about looks i dont think. I saw an Oprah show where they all talkeda bout how the other person was actually less attractive. But because they didnt have Bills/kids and all that.. they only saw the best of that person. Usually when women cheat it is for a connection with someone else.. never just sex for women. IMO|`|5woHsuLXaa	whenever my ex cheated on me it was always with uglier girls.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	No but he had a bigger Johnson|`|0hR5hMquaa	I have never cheated and never will. But when my ex cheated he too cheated with someone less attractive.|`|BlVudiyfaa	when my adulterous ex-wife cheated, she reminded me that he was "trim".|`|8GPwHbTqaa	When women cheat it is usually emotional.  They are looking for something their partner can't or won't give them.    It's a bonus if they are sexy!|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	im not a cheater,   but if i did it wouldnt   be because of looks;   because we connected on   different levels|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Very few men or women cheat with a better looking partner. That is a myth.|`|aHjXZEzoaa	he was nicer, sexier, treated me better, looked better to me...so i guess so.|`|AA11982228	No, not better looking...just horny and well hung!|`|aDIPIu7xaa	No.  It was some loser named John S I gave sympathy sex to.      LMAO!|`|EmUGA5Igaa	no I had a void that my partner was not filling and this new guy filled it and at te end of the day I had to realize that only me can make me happy|`|Axcy1DYlaa	For the record, i've never cheated on my current partner.. but past ones i did and yes... they were always more attractive. That's another reason I knew I wasnt really into my guy like i thought i was. it was a terrible thing and I would never do it again...|`|UNZuciedaa	funny how all these women say the mistress was uglier...like they'd admit she was hotter.  as for me...my girlfriend is way hotter and a lot younger than my wife|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I cheated on my first husband a lot. A whole lot. Sometimes, it was someone better looking. But their looks had never had anything to do with me hooking up. I'm not emotionally needy and have never been, so it certainly wasn't about not being emotionally fulfilled. It was always with someone who was 10x more sexually exciting. Sexual excitement is something I craved but didn't at all get from my husband. He was ultra prudish and about 10yrs older than me. I was an undercover wild child and extremely extroverted sexually.     Although I've remarried and no longer live the same way, I'm very honest about how I was living back then. I never cheated because I thought someone was more attractive than my husband but because I thought I wanted something else.
winUqiXdaa	funny you should say that ive just been to a january wedding, it was lovely but the weather was very cold with showers of snow but the sun was shining which im sure will look lovely on the photo's.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Not on January that I went, but I went for my brother's wedding 3 years ago on November and it did snow! poor bride and groom had to stand outside in snow while having their photographic taken!|`|7ac390e6e3620f7a413edd328b885940aa	No, but I have been to a wedding on December the 18th and it was below freezing.

We've been married now 3 years, together 5 years and we go overboard on birthdays and Christmas so there is really no need to celebrate Feb 14th.|`|0Id85yiYaa	don't know yet. we're getting married in march, so probably nothing too expensive. i might paint or make him something.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Nothing in particular.

Don't be jealous.

To begin with, you need to remember that people are all individuals with various levels of all sorts of characteristics such as sex drives. Early in our marriage, my sex drive was MUCH higher than my wife's. It drove me crazy because I certainly didn't want to 'demand' of her, but on the other hand it is like sleeping next to a buffet and not being allowed to eat. I did everything I could to not make demands of her and to release the tension that builds up. Trust me, it's not something that folks set out to have. It is not something we chose to have and it was definitely no fun. Now, these days, we're more in balance. I'm older and my sex drive is lower. She's older and her sex drive seems to be higher so we're better in sync. It is manageable.    But it sounds like your husband's sex drive is much higher than yours. This is not a moral issue or even a psychological one, but a physical one. Regardless of how you see it or how you chose to deal with it, you need to be supportive of this reality. It sounds like your sex drive is lower than his. That, too, is fine. We're all different. But face it and address it. You don't want to be involved? Fine. That's cool, but how about a compromise. Stay with him, be with him, while he masturbates. You don't have to do anything other than be there, hold him, support him and who knows, you might even find it exciting. And being with him, I can assure you that you will be the object of his desire. The fantasies in his mind will be of you. And, this is not dirty or nasty. This is an adult thing between two people who share very intimate lives as husband and wife. This is two married people who have only each other to satisfy their desires for intimacy. Your body is his and his is yours and you need to take care of each other. He's promised to keep himself only unto you so you need to be sensitive to his needs as I hope he is sensitive to yours.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	so now you want to control his dreams? grow up.|`|UgcPxd4maa	Umm, they're just dreams! You've never had a dream about another man??|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	y dont u help him...lol
jp5lfmzTaa	There is no question of stopping the act at home.    Just grow and get out of the mess yourself.    Work hard and move away.    Find a mate who can take care of you and you would love.    Its easier said than done.    Ignore the homefront disturbances, concentrate on your career or profession and leave good example to your offsprings.|`|SVecJI77aa	try to be calm and don't be scared.  coz this won't help u either.  I can say how it feels in such situations and its pretty difficult to be calm.  its obvious to get upset or angry.    But still try ur best and if possible try to calm ur father also..  U try and leave it to god. he is there and he sees everything.    just think that if these r the sad days for u then happy days are yet to come.|`|jStdkOvQaa	Hi..    Hang in there!     Listen I know it is tough. But life is tough. If it is not inside the home, you will end up finding something outside that is challenging and scary.     You need to learn how to deal with your dad. I think is that asking someone with some experience on how to help you protect yourself and your mom. I do not think that calling social services and recking your family will be a solution. I do not want you to break your home. Unless it is absolutely necessary that is.     Try to avoid whatever is ticking your dad off. When he is angry just get out of his way.    Try, somehow, to encourage that he goes for angry therapy.    Try to get close to him when he is in a good mood and tell him how scary and upsetting that is when he gets angry at you and your mom.     Good luck and protect yourself and your mom|`|WPKKswCaaa	I think that's there in Most of the Households Behind Closed Doors .. But Iam happy for you girl that you have courage to share this.  Please pay attention to College and think of your Future Life and your strong thoughts will be the only way to get detached from such cruel atmosphere. SHOW your SUPPORT AND LOVE TO MOM everytime any such incident happens next. DON T KEEP MUM. RAISE your Voice.. trust me it will work and will be gift to your MOM.
otTslvAOaa	if you already gave him a hint..... don't make matters worse, at this late hour, and hint at something else.    no matter what... be happy with what you get.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Since he asked you to send him a picture of a ring you'd like, go ahead and send the ring you linked and tell him you like it a lot as a non-engagement ring, just in case he needs an alternative ring hint.  And remember, if you guys are younger than your mid-20s, one year is generally still too soon to get engaged.|`|BlVudiyfaa	let it go|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Since y'all have only been together for a year, I would not rush into hinting a ring. That seems like it's moving a little too fast. My fiance and I have been together since June 14, 2004 and we got engaged on February 14, 2008. We are getting married October 24, 2009. I'm not saying you have to wait just because my fiance and I did... I just seem to notice that people that are young and rush into marriage, seem not to last long at all.  I think promise rings are a waste of money to be honest with you. I don't understand the point of them... I "promise" to marry you when the time comes... or whatever. Why don't you just get an engagement ring and stay engaged for a while? It'll at least be a ring worth purchasing since you will have it for the rest of your life... unlike the "promise ring"... normally you don't wear those much after you get engaged or married.|`|a3f885953107aeba33459bd9269d3a98aa	if you are talking about it then its ok to email him the link.. give few more suggestions and you will get the ring on valentine's day for sure. Good luck!|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	pretty ring =]    I know that heartsonfire.com allows you to send a hint to your special someone.    Browse through their rings as well. They are simply the best.|`|rywgn8HLaa	I think it's a beautiful ring, but I don't know if I would say anything to him about it. What if he does decide to get an engagement ring - is that the type of ring you want for your engagement ring?   He may have already bought the ring - if he has then it might make him feel bad or confused if you send him the new link.   However, sometimes it does help to speak up. A lot of women will get engagement rings that they absolutely hate and they dont know how to tell their fiance without hurting their feelings.  If you truly feel like you need to say something then send him an email with the link. Just say something like, I'm not sure what you are planning for Valentines Day, but you asked me to give you some idea of what type of ring you liked. Tell him that you saw this ring and you thought it was really beautiful, so you just wanted to share it with him.   Good luck!

otTslvAOaa	enjoy the beach your first two days.... and stay in the room and have fun the rest of the week.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Well, if you have a resort, & it being your honeymoon you probably arent going to venture out too often anyways, so I wouldnt go somewhere else.  Myrtle Beach is always a little crowded, but if you know how to do it, it can still be quiet/romantic.  Go outside of the main part of Myrtle to do your shopping, & to eat. Go to the beach early in the morning or later in the evening so there are less people.  Do some of your sightseeing before biker week.   Just enjoy yourselves. ( :|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Biker week is loud.  Very very loud.  We have a place at North Myrtle Beach (miles from Myrtle) and it even gets booked all the way up there.  We often don't rent it that week b/c when people find out it's biker week, they tend to look elsewhere.    You'll hear the Harleys without the mufflers all day long.  Every time one starts on the strip, you'll know.  And there is no going to bed early either since they drive up and down til 1am.    Honestly if it were me, I'd wait two weeks and take my honeymoon then.  After Biker Week and Black Biker Week (that's the next week) are over and done.|`|BlVudiyfaa	Niagara Falls. Stay on the Canadian side. Stay at the Hilton and get a room facing the falls. You won't be disappointed.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	I would go somewhere just because myrtle beach is never relaxing. Although I'd die for a honeymoon down at biker week (I love motorcycles lol) I've been down to myrtle beach when its not biker week. Walking on the strip is amazing at night and I highly suggest the ripleys aquarium if you need something to do.  But even without biker week it is loud and very busy. I would suggest a place with a beach, maybe virginia is nice, and go for walks on the beach every night its so amazing and truly romantic and relaxing.     Good luck, and enjoy yourself.|`|KglW7g96aa	oh yes, go somewhere else.   myrtle in general is quite crowded, but during biker week is just, ridiculous.  if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing time.. that is not it.   it is so hard to get around, not to mention you can even hear the bikes all day from the beach and the pools. no fun.     i'd say take it somewhere else.  congratulations!|`|624f4643a1438a24354344100c89b712aa	Myrtle Beach always has something going on, i'd say stay there.  they won't be that bad.|`|F4k68ilkaa	It's pretty bad. If you want peace and quiet, go somewhere else.|`|3Rrlii0Laa	My sister and I accidently happened upon it in 2000, it really is that bad. The place is over run, go somewhere else.
VjMyHAWraa	Being abused  in any form is no laughing matter! Going to counseling and taking meds might make you feel better but he's the one that needs help! If he thinks it's a joke more than likely he doesn't think he needs help so probably won't got to counseling. Unfortunately I have been a victim of abuse for years and still haven't left! I plead with you to leave before you feel stuck with your situation. It will not get better!!! It only gets worse!! You deserve much much better than him!

Just leave because it's not much of a relationship anyway.|`|SqGsgwlTaa	no it is not common for that to happen what you need to do is GET RID OF HIM if he is the cause for your depression plz get out before it gets any worse i've been there and things will get worse|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	Violence is never funny, if you would hire someone to hit him with a baseball bat and just say it was a joke would he find it amusing? Get out of this situation before it escalates and you become a statistic. You are young in the start of your life, and this is a train wrack waiting to happen. You are on the right path seeking help but your depression is partially due to this person you are with, you need supportive loving environment and a partner who protects and loves you.|`|K71ZlPWgaa	You need to stop him from hitting you cause it could start to get really serious. If he is abusing you then you should really talk to a counsellor see a lawyer. What he is doing is against the law, it might become a snowball effect and you might get hurt really badly. A lot women are affected by domestic violence you are at the begging stage, this is when it is easy to stop it don't fall into a big trap, take the advice of friends and family and do not, I copy do not stand up for him cause this man that is hitting you can't be that nice.  Furthermore to answer your last question most decent men do not hit for a joke especially when you get to 26, my sister is your age and married and her husband does not harm her in such ways, so I think that domestic violence is in your life and you need to stop it. This my opinion but I don't have all the facts it is your choice in the end not mine, not anyone elses just yours.....|`|v398Qalyaa	it really makes me angry hearing how some people treat others, no it isn't 'common' to hit someone for a joke, it's cruel and demeaning and you don't have to put up with it. for god's sake girl get out of this destructive relationship before it's too late, you are worth far more than this, look what he has reduced you to, however hard it is, just bite the bullet and dump this loser|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Finish this sentence for me "I am with this man because....................." then when you have worked out the answer you will know what to do and stop all the excuses like I know I have to get out but its hard as I am the only one in the country from my family etc., so what, its not them thats getting abuse its you so do something about it.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Leave.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	The second one is sooo much prettier.  I'm into Renaissance Faires as well but I hate the wipple look like that first one.  It's so nun.  The neck is so gorgeous on your pattern and you'll end up obscuring the shoulders and neck with the first one.    I'd really need to see how cream the dress is to know if I'd go with a cream or white veil.  You don't want it to be too creamy either.  One idea is that if you buy the white veil and soak it in some strong tea.  Not long but just a couple hours.  Rinse it out.  That gives it a slightly antique look which usually goes much better with a Renaissance look since they would not have pure white back then.    I wouldn't layer the two b/c I think it will be too heavy and obscure your vision too much.  I love the silver circlet.  I think that is absolutely gorgeous but I think opaque might be too heavy a look.  Have you considered lace for a more period look?|`|qPd5G3dSaa	this is VERY intresting... but why dont you go with a colored veil to match the flowers or somthin it would look much more appealing that white or cream... but just a suggestion?|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Do you have a picture of your dress? It would be easier for me to tell if the veil would look good or not if I had the picture of the dress.  Normally, you try to match the color of the veil with the dress, because if you don't, it will look very tacky.  Layering may work,  but then again... it might look too much.    -=edit=-  Ah, okay. Yeah... I think the silver circlet will look good over the ivory. Silver looks good with just about anything.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I would do it in ivory/cream.  I love your circlet!

Good luck and congrats!|`|qB4KvbDiaa	a nice romantic dinner,at a fancy restaurant someplace near a lake,with a beautiful scenery|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	I got engaged on Valentine's Day last year. =) I will tell you what he did so you can have some ideas.  My fiance and I had a nice dinner at home which was really romantic. I would rather him fix me something at home than go out and fight the crowds and wait forever to get a table at a restaurant.  I had to work on Valentine's Day, but I got off around 6:30 (I worked at a bank as a teller). When I got home, he had the food already made on the plates and on the table with a candlelight dinner, roses, a big stuffed bear (I love stuffed animals) on a chair beside mine, champagne in an ice bucket, and champagne glasses already on the table. It was REALLY romantic and I was really surprised. He didn't have the bear that was holding the ring (he got it at Zales with my ring... it's a stuffed bear that's glittery and it's holding a heart box.. and then when you open the box, it has the ring box/jewelry box inside) because he didn't want me to know he had something else for me. After we got done eating... we opened our gifts (I got him some stuff to unwrap) and then read our cards from each other. After that, he said he had to go to the bathroom for a second and would be back. A few minutes after that.. he came behind me with another stuffed bear. I didn't realize that the box opened though. lol He had to tell me to open the box... haha  But yeah... it was really sweet and my best Valentine's Day, ever.    You could also go to a park (if it's nice outside) and have one of your friends take pictures of the proposal. Just make sure that she doesn't seem your friend taking pictures because then she'll know what's going on. My friend did this when he proposed and it was really sweet. They had pictures too of the proposal which was neat.    I also had another friend leave a trail of clues that lead her places that were the special places of where they went when they first met, first kiss, first date, etc. He had a rose at every spot as well for her to get and then at the end, she ended up with a certain amount of roses (I don't remember how many roses, but the number of roses had something to do with a special number between the two of them). You can only really do that though when everything is close by. lol You wouldn't want her driving 30 minutes to get places. After she got done finding all the clues... he then had one last final "spot" where he was standing when she got there. He had a lot of rose petals around with a stuffed animal and had the box with the ring in it inside his pocket. He then told her some sweet stuff (haha) and then proposed. He also had his friend taking pictures as well... he had a friend at every location too where the "clues" were. It was neat seeing the pictures after it all had happened.    Good luck! =)|`|AA10403609	Don't propose on Valentine's Day, instead do it the day before, if you choose to do so, get a limo, arrange for the car to pick her up take her to the favorite place you both enjoy, have her favorite flowers waiting along with her favorite things she enjoys to it, you will arrive before her and prepare the setting for her, you could Even rent a tux or a outfit she likes on you, while she is taking this all in, you can get down on one day a ask for her hand in marriage, her family and friends could be there to share in this happy day or just the two of you,  A ride through Central Park is always nice. Congratulations, Hope it works out well for you|`|AA11790156	try this site
otTslvAOaa	the ideal place for a wedding ceremony........ WOULD BE IN A CHURCH.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	This place fits, but it can only be for a very small group  http://www.bearmountainlodge.net/?ce9d58...|`|qB4KvbDiaa	sounds like my home|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I know you said New Hampshire, but have you considered Maine? They might have some places like that too. I wish I could help you out with specific locations. I know how frustrating it is to try to find what you're looking for in regards to an outdoor ceremony that's not one of those fancy white glove places (I'm looking in MA currently for my ceremony site and I'm going nuts with frustration!). What I've found yields the most results is to use google, but avoid the word wedding. As soon as you type in wedding all those fancy schmancy places pop up first. Do a search for mountains with ski lodges and see what you get. Some places do weddings and don't really advertize that.     Best of luck
2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	There's having different interests, and there's having different life goals. Sounds to me that you and your significant other have different goals, which is a real problem. Moving out of your state is not really an "interest" - it's a goal. If you want to move and he wants to stay - this alone makes you incompatible, unless one of you is willing to change your goal. Different interests can be dealt with by cultivating outside friendships; it certainly helps to have SOME things in common, but there's nothing wrong with pursuing separate interests as well (you like to travel, he doesn't - find a travel companion: a girlfriend, your sister, your mom, etc; he loves football and you don't - he can watch football with his buddies and leave you out of it). However, having opposite goals is a much more serious problem.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You should never approach a relationship with the idea that you can change the other person.  You can't.    What you can do is determine if your differences are so great that you won't be able to overcome them (find compromises).  There's nothing wrong with having other friends to participate in the things your partner doesn't enjoy.    My husband is a football junkie.  You couldn't PAY ME to watch football.  So.. on football days, he watches with his buddies and I do something I like that he doesn't - shopping!|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	If he's willing to try the things you like and you're willing to try the things he likes, then it can work.  If you want to change him, then it won't.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Never ever think you are going to change someone.  Either accept him as he is, or find someone else.|`|d20mM90uaa	Don't waste time LIFE is TOOOOO short for that|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	My husband is into cars, motorcycles, and airplanes. I couldn't care less about these things. I'm in to reading, home repair, and theatre. He doesn't particularly care about those things.     It's about compromise. We both do things that the other enjoys and somewhere along the way I started enjoying spending time with him at the car show and he's looking forward to going to the theatre again. But we also realize that there's times when we do our own thing.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I find it interesting that you did not realize this while dating.  I'm old, and have made the same mistakes, so I'm not bitching at you.  It is when we are in love/lust, we think people will change. Wrong.  Yes, your wasting your time, I would tell him what your plans are, and if he does not wish to take part in your life, then you will find it necessary to end this relationship.  Good luck.|`|22DqqZKoaa	My husband is obsessed with computers. He just spent $2000 on a desktop. I hate it. I thought he was going to have to change his pants when it finally arrived and he opened it.  It's sooooo irritating. He always tries to talk to me about computer related topics and I am just not interested. He's happy at home playing video games and whatnot. I'm more of a social person, so on weekends and sometimes weekdays I go out with friends and he stays at home. It works.  He does whine about not having anyone to talk to about computers though. :p|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Well, it sounds like you're pretty negative about it.  Lots of couples have really different interests and it works out fine.  They just use that as their "apart" time and do things with friends or family.  Sounds like you're fed up and wanting him to change, but he'll only do that if he wants to.  The part about wanting to move might be a deal-breaker, considering you are also very negative about where you live.  You just sound like you shouldn't be in a relationship right now.  To feel like you're "wasting time"?  You're obviously just not that into him, set him free to pursue someone who is.|`|8GPwHbTqaa	Leave now if you think you want to live somewhere else and he doesn't.  I have been with my hubs for 7 yrs and we have completely diff. likes.  I have completely changed and now am very unhappy.     You are young and should find someone who wants the same things you do.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think it's easier to have a relationship with someone who enjoys the same things that you do.  For instance, one of my ex boyfriends loved to party and every weekend someone had a bash - I hated it because I'm not a partier and my body does not like staying out late but I tolerated it for 2 years until I was getting sick so frequently (strep throat) that I could barely function.    Less then a year later I met a great guy, whom I married, and we've never been to a bar or club together in the 5 years we've now known each other - we're happily in bed at 9pm every night.  So yeah, I think compatibility is everything.
UndOg7yeaa	assure her that its ok if she doesnt know how that you can instruct her. and just try to make it comfortable..compliment her and tell her how beautiful she is.|`|KkFnSouWaa	Just talk with her and assure her that you're okay with her body and help her make herself comfortable|`|ZyPqznLFaa	She may be afraid that she'll do it wrong, or you'll think bad of her cuz she doesn't know what she's doing.|`|AA11185479	This isn't anything you can change her mind on.  She needs to learn how to accept herself, and that's something that only comes from within.  No validation or encouragement from anyone else will ever convince her that she is pretty/sexy/good/worthy/whatever enough unless SHE believes it deep down.    All you can do is be supportive.  Asking her to experiment with new things sends her the message that she isn't good enough the way she is, that she has to be more and more provocative to hold your interest.  Try rephrasing things to emphasize what SHE wants, what makes HER feel confident and loved.      Ask her to share with you why she feels uncomfortable with herself - and then just listen.  Men's first reaction is to "solve" the problem, whereas women often just want validation and sympathy.  Let HER solve the problem, in her own time.  Just be there for her and let her know you care.
eeHrcxjEaa	Cheating is:  Doing anything with someone else that you wouldn't want your partner to know about.    This definition works in every case.    It applies to less-strict couples: holding hands or even kissing may not be cheating to them, because neither one would care if the other one knew.  So neither would consider it cheating.    However, it also applies to stricter couples: to some people, a simple wink may not be considered cheating, but to these people, one or both partners would be upset if they found out their partner had winked at someone else. So winking in this case would be considered cheating.|`|faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	feeling somethign for another person... and then acting upon it     1. flirting is not cheating but it is dishonest and worth being mad over  2. spending time with another person, if you both know there are romantic feelings between you - I think this is borderline cheating  3. discussing having a relationship, lying to your wife, telling this person they are beautiful you like/love them... all of the signs of a relationship ... even before it crosses over into being even slightly physical (i.e. holding hands, peck) is cheating!   Your bond with a wife/husband is to love them solely to display this sort of sole feeling/love to another person is essentially cheating.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Harmless flirting is just that, both my OH & I enjoy the company of others & as adults men can't help but flirt & women will respond.  If this is done in front of your spouse then it is not an issue, especially when you have a deep trust in each other.     However if the person concerned starts making suggestive comments - & is offering themself up on a platter I would certainly deem it cheating.   Anything that you wouldn't do or say to the opposite sex in front of your spouse could be deemed cheating.|`|gMG31qVyaa	I don't believe flirting is cheating. Flirting and being flirted with is a little self-esteem boost, nothing more. If you are in a relationship and decide to become intimate with someone else, i.e. kissing, oral sex or intercourse, I'd consider that cheating. If a woman who is in a relationship asks another man to be with her sexually then she is definitely being unfaithful.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	Great question!    I have a very narrow definition of "cheating" because I don't think people who flirt occasionally (for instance) deserve to be painted with the same brush as a full-on adulterer.    For your examples I would say the first is not cheating but something I would never want to see done blatantly w/out the SO's awareness and approval.  And a dealbreaker if done often enough.    The second I would still not consider cheating, but I would consider it extremely disrespectful and disloyal (probably dealbreakers in themselves).|`|96HWpdkFaa	Flirting is not good...not exactly cheating but should be stopped.    Cheating is holding hands, kissing, sex...  it can even be cyber sex I consider that cheating.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	that's cheating. It's emotional cheating, basically playing with fire. anytime you are doing something that you know would make your partner upset, or hurt them. then it's cheating.    the examples you gave are cheating, because I'm sure she wouldn't ask those same questions if her partner could hear her. If you won't say or do it in front of your partner, then yes it's very very very very very very very very very very very very WRONG!|`|YjUyBWPEaa	I consider anything cheating that would hurt my husband if he found out about.  If you are married or in a relationship you should not be talking about having sex with someone else.  If your talking about it there is a reason behind the talk.|`|iNMk96Aiaa	Anything you feel you need to hide from your partner is cheating. If you are thinking of someone in that way and trying to make an effort is cheating. Cheating doesn't necessarily mean physical interaction|`|k73IxCHaaa	Well according to the answers that have been given, it would appear that 90% of the people out there have cheated at one time or the other. And of course we know they are all men.|`|8dgaCgieaa	when you have an emotional or physical connection with someone else. in this case she could be trying to boost her self confidence, but its not a good idea. she should be happy with who she is with. i think she is setting the stage to cheat at this point, which can be just as wrong|`|IVsUfHENaa	cheating and flirting both wrong .it is like you use some thing to belongs for some one als .or you broking Other people's  marriage.it is hurt!?|`|5M0FBU89aa	Wow-   Looks like some women on this thread keep their SO's on a short leash :-)    I really don't know how "flirting" is cheating, since there really is no "intent".    And the comment about "Things you wouldn't want your spouse to know" is kind of vague, because that could mean hiding a present from him/her.    My answer (really more legal than emotional):    1.  Sexual touching  2.  Exchange of bodily fluids|`|cLDbxtARaa	When body parts start showing|`|GWRP3vLQaa	WTF? Yes, it is cheating.

It can be subjective, yet hardly communicated until after the fact for most couples.|`|7b98229ae13a8cd3f0b0f8525bd0dea9aa	if you have to ask its probably cheating|`|DlCcFu1eaa	If I understand what my wife's been trying to teach me all these years it's like this;    Anything I do that she doesn't like is bad, evil and possibly cheating.

NAthdZB4aa	Talk to her about her old school (old science class?), if she likes/plays any sports/instruments, her favorite school subject, favorite kind of music. It doesn't matter- go with what you think you two can talk about. As long as you are friendly and kind I am sure you will be able to get to know her better!   After you guys talk a little, then feel free to ask her out. That way, you won't just seem like you are interested in her as just a friend.|`|RJHaUs9Paa	Well, i personally dont like it when guys just come up and talk to me when i can tell they're just trying to get with me. Don't make it obvious...just be yourself of course, ask for a pencil or something like that dont just ask her her fave color or something kinda like that, ya know, dont let your friends make it obvious, dont be TOO available, just and get her interested, just dont creep her out, im sure you wont=) good luck....and try to make her laugh =D  |`|z0HWA6vRaa	go over to her and star a conversation about something you both enjoy or about how sucky/great the teacher is and what she thinks about the school and how it compares to her old school or whatever, just ask alot of questions, people like talking about themselves...oh and dont forget to be yourself and being funny wont hurt either|`|EQ46eupcaa	Just say I like your eyes or hair or something like that and flirt, then ask her on a date casually, but don't make it seem like a date, make it seem like a friend meeting, bring friends and people she may like to meet, then get to know her there and make your move.|`|CpEOqbxdaa	First talk about the class your in... and say you need help with something. ask her. and just keep talking. this step could take a while. then when you think there is a connection ask her to hang out sometime. from there you should kno what to do.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Ask here what kind of music she likes. What kind she hates. Her favorite subject in school and why. Her least favorite. Whats her favorite food, which is the one she most wants to try but hasn't had yet.

iXQuSNtqaa	It could be his shyness, maybe he can't come up with a way to ask you out. Most guys are most comfortable around their friends. Keep trying to get to know him, ask him where you guys stand. Again it definitely could be shyness, he called you to that party because he knew he couldn't make a fool of himself in front of you, which could also be why he barely talked to you. It may have looked like you were having a good time mingling so he thought you were enjoying yourself.    Talk to him, try to get to know, let him know he can be comfortable around you.|`|RebQV11Yaa	First thing.  How long ago did you meet him?  Shy guys might take a few weeks to maybe a month or 2 to warm up to a lady they like.  Next don't push him too hard, just let him know that you enjoy his company.  If this happened like last week...give it some time.  However if its going on like 3-4 months, I'd have to say he's just not that into you.|`|kpWvZ6Yxaa	he is shy :D|`|gHmgBfwxaa	it could be either.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	take the lead and give him a call and ask if he would like to go do something|`|IuIp7Eevaa	he might be playing hard to get, but he is a little old for it|`|mmwrvvk1aa	Guys are just shy about being to forward, and maybe he just hasn't dated that much and doesn't know how to handle a situation.|`|c4EAUfhFaa	He is just not that into you.

I think he is very into you otherwise he would not be so shy and would just make out with you and try to pressure you for sex, but instead he is nervous and doesnt want to do anything that would make you uncomfortable and possibly jeopardize the relationship. Maybe you should try to kiss him. I bet that when he realizes your ok with it he will start to kiss you :).|`|H7B4x6MNaa	what i think about this case is just a bit clearer then most i have seen. he is (A) using you to get back at someone (B) cheating on you but still thinks its ok because hes just all out there or (C) hes just not that into you anymore. not that he ever was, oh and all the shy crap he is giving you he just wants to get in  your pants most likely get you pregnant {he also might think hes one of thoseoh **** and ditch type of guys}     resolution to all:                you should releve yourself of all the stress [if you have any] and just go hang out with some friends maybe meet the guy who actually calls you.                           P.S. if he breaks up with you by text then hes just a jerk/pussy [sorry about last comment may offened you, correct me if im wrong)|`|I24AuawZaa	Could just be shy, I'm not that keen on asking girls out either :/|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	You should try and be more aggressive. Initiate the conversation. I'd give it one more shot and if he doesn't respond, move on. There's to many guys to waste time on just him.|`|udEUVbOvaa	Maybe you should give it time. He might be shy, like you said, but then again he might want to be just friends. If he thinks that you only want to be more than friends, it might put him off altogether. Keep as friends and he might come around!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i would think that after going out with you a few times, he wouldn't be that shy to call you every now and then. i would take it as a sign he really isn't interested in you. that wasn't nice of him to invite you to his friends house and ignores you all night. i would move on and find another.
yJKEH4I3aa	I think he just wants to use u. (Y else would he want 2 b frendz with benefits) And the fact that he's telling u that ur hot probably makes that idea sound even more correct. Don't answer him back. My ex used to say the same thing and it ended up with him trying to hold me down in his car.    Firstly- The mere fact that he said he wanted to be "frendz wit benefits" shows that he probably doesnt have that much love or even respect 4 u. Idt that he ever had, otherwise he woudnt have asked 4 dat d day after y'all broke up               OR............               It cud mean that he probably wants to impress u cuz he thinks that u probably think that the whole idea is "mature and attractive" idk he probably does like u still.    Secondly- No boy with would call u "hot" out of love. Like I said b4 he's probably trying 2 impress u cuz he thinks u like 2 hear those things. Look 4 a guy who calls u beautiful. He could be an a**h*** like the other guys who use that line 4 sex!!!! Trust me    Thirdly- He probably is only flirting wit u and him callng u his "lady" is prbably him trying to make u feel good so that he can get in ur pants. Don't let him. He probably doesnt love u. I'm sorry but it cud b tru. Hope I helped|`|sunZH89Gaa	You broke up with him and you are worried about if he wants to just use you (by use I assume you mean sleeping with you) or if he likes you? Why did you break up with him? Would you consider getting back with him? A really hard one to answer without the facts, he may want you back but ask him.Personally, friends w/ benefits is pretty self-explanatory.|`|N1qKXDs2aa	use|`|p0dxIZeSaa	i think he's just trying to win you back, starting with the benefits.|`|27aea472b3667b064c6f98d70ac05c5caa	It sound like he just likes you, why would he want to "use you". If you are not interested in him romantically, cut the FWB ties.|`|9FL1w7UVaa	Maybe|`|3xksQz9haa	It sounds like he wants to use you, but he may still have feelings for you.|`|fR9KdYPpaa	likes you as a friend, but I dont think he wants to get back together.  sorry hun, hes a guy......can u really expect any kind of decency from them??|`|KXZ8jIP9aa	i think its a little bit of both. In a good way though. He might be missing you AND getting busy with you.|`|yC6wINPcaa	srry but he iz a uzer babe he dont want 2 b ur friend he wants ur "benifits!" hell no would i giv him any benefits ur 2 good 4 him anywayz.|`|z9uCBsmxaa	probably a little of both.  You'll be able to tell if you tell him you won't have sex with him.  If he calls you, you'll know.  If he doesn't call you....|`|kQPQolVEaa	breaking up with you then asking to be friends with benefits is definitely using!!! its obvious that he just wants the physical aspect of a relationship without truly caring about you|`|siyJgjozaa	girl he is just flirting.. you know how guys are|`|dvLWOVOWaa	lol...sounds like he just wants to have sex with you.  although i don't mind the whole friend with benefits thing, but I'm a guy...go figure.|`|iK7VXri7aa	lol its not that hard. friends with benefits= using you|`|rBJmFgCDaa	he wants you to come running back to him and make things right again    GO FOR IT!!|`|6TlAd2TGaa	Well that's a difficult question...  You mean use you to get popularity. If a guy has a girl friend.   Well it's hard to tell. Usually people don't tell their crush that they think they're hot. But what's confusing is you said he wanted to be your friends. Friends don't call each other hot. It sounds like he's not the shy type. This is kind of hard to tell. I wouldn't date him right now though. It's kind of weird... My advise if you want to find out if he likes you is observe how he acts around you. If he just complements you on and on loudly he doesn't like you. If he tries to impress you and is very concerned about what you think of him and the things he does then he probably does.|`|AA10953937	Why would he want the whole cow when he can just get the milk with no strings attached?      Nobody tells you let's be friends with benefits unless they only want to call on you for a booty call.  When it's a booty call, it is what it is! There is no thinking about what did  he mean when he said....   or I wonder is he thinking about me?  He's on to his next quest.  He didn't use you because you were with him willing. If you want to be friends with this guy, then call your relationship what it is ...a booty call!     If your friends were really your friends they would tell he already used you.  Here's a piece of advice: Don't let anyone know you know he used you. Play it off and don't be so available to him.    Good luck!|`|qqHx4KmMaa	If a guy gets dumped usually he won't show how hurt he is, but it sounds like your ex was just thinking about missing the benefits so he didn't want to give that up. He might still have feelings for you, but if he was trying to get you back he would be saying more relationship-like things like "I miss you" rather than "you look hot". If he is only looking into the physical side of things it seems like he is just looking for a good hookup. My ex used to say charming little things like "welcome my lady" and that usually only really means he is trying to charm you, it's nothing from the heart, just something to get you thinking.|`|V20PTwMmaa	love never ends in friendship  .....else it isnt love|`|sbMrAt96aa	he ONLY wants SEX from you, nothing more......    SO Yeah, he's USING YOU!    Don't give it up...............|`|yC7hgBfGaa	i think u should.............|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	I think he wants to make you jealous so you'll go crawling back to him.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	I'm sure he still has feelings for you..But if you broke up with him..being friends with benefits would make your situation with him kind of ackward. He could feel as if you guys are stil together...i feel he is using you..be cause who says "oh yea by the way can we still have sex"..move on with your life yea you can be friends but nothing more.|`|5xZeSF8Laa	he just wants to do stuff with u cause u broke up with him so friends with benefits means he can still get with u even though u dumped him|`|t0uIgY08aa	he might still have feelings for you, maybe he is one of those guys that doesn't wanna f*** the world and know that he's safe with you. BUT in all honesty don't do it. Feelings never go away and your always tied down.|`|AA10455206	He just wants to have his cake and eat it too.  Meaning yes, he wants to use you because if he has you there sort of waiting, he can have you and anyone else who comes along.  Also that friendship with benefits sounds trashy to me.  What kind of good friends get involved in a sexual relationship.  Wake up.|`|KmaXKjuHaa	If you had sex then he wants you for sex and nothing more. He misses the physical. This is all he knows in the relationship. What is the past relationship based on? What was the attraction?|`|AA11112243	Yeah, it sounds like he wants to be friends with benefits.  And i think you both have to be really mature to be in that type of relationship.  I know my ex, wanted to hurt me after i broke up with him even though he told me that was the last thing he wanted to do.....i could just tell he wanted to get even that i broke up with him.|`|0At8ONbKaa	Two words, hun: BOOTY. CALL.    This is obviously a user. If he really liked you, he would've respected your decision to be just friends and left it at that. Later on he would've made a move if he really liked you. But if he immediately asked to be "friends with benefits", he's totally a user and is just desperate.    You need to find yourself a new man, girl.|`|SGjhNidDaa	he wants to use you. if he actually loved you, "hot" wouldnt be the word he's use. He'd say, "you're beautiful, inside and out."  and he wouldnt want the friends with benefits thing if he respected you. i think hes just physically attracted to you. hes a jerk, move on!!
WDs4fRoxaa	You just have social anxiety. It is totally treatable, but you have  to get help as soon as possible before college starts.    Best wishes|`|ZyPqznLFaa	As a girl who was homeschooled throughout highschool, I too felt alone and without friends. I am a 20 year old college student in my first semester. College is so much different than highschool. It is in no way a popularity contest, and people who look like they would of never talked in highschool are friends in college. Everyone has this mature mentality that makes college so much easier.   So you can go to college without having friends, and no one would know. I did! lol  But if you want to make friends, you should get involved in an activity that you enjoy. Sounds cliche, but it's true. If you want to take a pottery class, do it. You'll meet new people. You'll just have to come out of your shell and talk to people. Otherwise, you'll never make friends.    If you have any questions, or just want to talk, feel free to email or IM me.   Good luck!|`|yxoXTmlqaa	The key to being confident is thinking confidently.   Take charge of your friends, ask them to hang out.

Try to talk to people. If someone comes to talk to you  be friendly and make him feel comfortable in talking to you    make the people want you. The way you dress accosiate with   other people tell alot about you and if you are mopping around alot  and slumping. What does that tell about you. it tells that you really dont care and it does not have to be like that. You have to be happy  and make the best out of your life.     just try to do better!!!  ?

cLDbxtARaa	alot in common and being friends|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	I stayed friends with a few exes along the way until I realized they wanted to get back together.  But I never considered them best friends, and I never wanted to get back together with any of them.|`|k73IxCHaaa	Not necessarily, before I was married I was friends with all of my ex-girlfriends. Contrary to popular beliefs men can be friends with women where there is no sex involved. Since I've been married they've gotten married and I haven't heard from or seen any of them in decades. But I still have my buddies from decades age, now isn't that strange.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	you do it in case your current relationship doesn't work out so you can maybe get back together. chances are, if he wants to be friends with his ex its because she dumped him and they would still be dating if it were up to him.|`|bgWfcplBaa	Sometimes someone is so important to you, that you just can't imagine your life without that person. They understand you and give great advice, or maybe they just genuinely like and admire them.  If the spark isn't there, and there is no romantic connection, then I completely understand why he may want to continue the relationship on a friend level. However, the question is whether or not YOU can handle just being friends. If the romantic chemistry is still there for you, you may hold on to the notion that you could get back together. Personally, I think that would just set you up to be hurt and disappointed in the future.|`|WewCtMpzaa	There are guys who could be just friends, and not have sexual interest, but I think it could lead to problems during the hard or blurry times. It would be too easy to mess around and not realize it until at very least a moment later.    I believe ex's can have a special hold on you. They know how to get you going, and might get you going at a desperate moment.|`|AA11603829	Maybe the relationship didn't end on bad terms.|`|BzH7l27oaa	yep, men don't waste their time with women they are not attracted to or don't wish to boink eventually.|`|lyWSufFBaa	Some people are better friends then lovers.  Maybe they tried the dating thing and even though it didn't work out they didn't let that interfere with their friendship.  Some friendships are too important to just let go.  We all know that real friends are hard to come by.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Well, maybe the romance didn't work out, but whatever it was they had in common that drew them together in the first place was still there.  Eg. common interests, having fun together, interesting conversations.
Fo94E8QNaa	i totally know how you feel i broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years cause i had to move away and we barely talk anymore but after i told one of my best friends how i felt i felt way better its like you just need to let it all out and tell someone who actually will listen to you    also it helped alot when i started meeting other guys, like i started liking this one guy and im slowly starting to like my ex less and less so just let go of him and go meet other guys =)
3xksQz9haa	I was pretty much best friends with my ex too after we broke up, but I still had feelings for him and he didn't have any for me.     I learned that it was best to just let go and let him live his own life without me. When I was friends with him, it was harder for me to get over him. Now I am in another relationship and completely over him.
QB2OcoZUaa	Hmm, that's hard to answer. It seems like he might have a little crush on you, but hasn't quite got over his ex. Let him be with whoever he wants to, but talk to him more, and give him hugs stuff like that. Don't hesitate to get closer with him! Just let things play out with time. I was in a situation like this, but I still got closer and closer with the guy I liked and now he's my boyfriend and I love him! ^^  Give it time, and see what happens, do what you feel is right =3|`|gHmgBfwxaa	im not sure whats going on|`|pUulqtLGaa	can u say it with more deatil i wanna help u out but i need to know what cuz i casn't understand this srry|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	Forget about him. He's a jerk. Not worth your time. There's better out there for you. :] Plus don't act like you care. If you're careless about him chances are he'll want you more.|`|0471f82106cdee7f1760065c931cfd34aa	My dear, why did you ask for a friend to ask him?  You should ask him yourself!  Anyway, it's done. Maybe he doesn't really like you, maybe for him you are just "pretty hot", but not enough to like you, and perhaps he's shamed now...  And you are close to his ex??? Is she really your friend? Are you sure you want that man? Because maybe you loose both soon...
EPaYoJaiaa	I went to my cousins wedding a few weekends ago and his reception was in the church. I was pleasently surprised. When I heard the reception was in the church I kept picturing glaring lights and a 'cold' atmosphere but the lights were dimmable and the decorations made the reception room feel very 'warm' and inviting. It was very nice. Their colors were purple and silver that helped, and there were candles spread out on the tables.    Also, as you said there was no alcohol but they had two good 'punches' I liked a lot. One was hawaiian punch with orange sherbert it was sooo good, and the other was ice coffee with coffee icecream...I'm not a big coffee drinker so I didn't like that one as much as the hawaiian and sherbert but it was still good. They also of course had hot coffee, decaf, and tea and sparkling cider for the toast.  And there was dancing with the usual music played at most weddings except for the fact that they were the clean versions.|`|9kjpm2oQaa	Yeah my dads reception was in a church,downstairs. It was a small wedding so it worked. It was nice though, classy and cost effective|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	many many times and it always works fine!  actually having the reception in the church is a bit of a bonus as you don't have alcohol and it saves you a ton of money and you can blame the church for not having it! lol you can use sparkling juices and punches for beverages.  seriously you can decorate the room/hall however you like generally speaking and its no different from another venue - except the cost!  it is far far less expensive to use the church hall if they have one!  depends on the church as to whether you can have dancing - some do - some don't~  good luck and happy wedding!|`|AA10975867	Probably 50% of the weddings we attend are held in the church hall right next door. Yes, alcohol is allowed in most of them. You get a private party license or the caterer does. The way the hall looks depends on how old/new it is, how much the parishioners maintain it. I've seen some church halls that are nicer and newer than some hotel banquet rooms!!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I've been to several.  they are usually small weddings and small receptions.  They have been very nice and wouldn't have been any different than if they were in a hotel conference room or some place else.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Yes most of the weddings I've been to had receptions in the churches hall. I wanted to have my own reception at the church but I also wanted to dance, it was important to us. It's easier to decorate and clean up after it's over (I've been behind the scenes in two weddings). It can be made to look just as beautiful as anywhere else. It depends on the building before I could give any ideas but you'll have to make sure you flow your colors better into this room from the sanctuary because the guests will be there directly after the ceremony with no in between drive.    Good Luck|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	I did go to one a few months and it was beautiful. The hall was beautiful anyway and they decorated the walls with tulle and it looked amazing. I already knew that it was going to be a dry wedding and i had alot of fun just talking to the guests.|`|F5qGKwfUaa	A church can work out fine. You may have to be mindful of the music that you and of alcohol but, that's about it. I think that it is a celebration of the couple and fun with their families. A nice dinner along with classical or instrumental music and great conversations and  memories will be great.Also, have great food and a pretty decor at the least but, most of all have fun...it's YOUR day and no one else.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I've been to lots of receptions held in church fellowship halls and they weren't any different than those held elsewhere. Guests enjoyed themselves just fine.|`|l700dey7aa	yes a church is a good idea .was just to a church for a recpition worked great|`|6n527pAYaa	If the church has a nice hall for events, it can work out fine.  And some churches permit some alcohol.|`|8bQ684Evaa	i don't think i would have any thoughts, ideas, or experiences b/c i never been in a wedding reception helded in a church building|`|8kdjvWAxaa	one of my friends did. It was really nice but it did kind of look like a reception hall. I was upset nothing to drink but i had fun. GOOD LUCK:)|`|NvW6voPJaa	Yes, where I live we have many churches that have nice halls.  I have been to a few, and they are nice.  And, the best part is....they are usually much cheaper than a hotel or other reception venue.|`|UwrVK72aaa	I've been to many receptions held in churches. They have been really nice. There was never any dancing or alcohol though. But the cake was set up .Somebody usually takes the presents before hand and drives them over to the newleyweds house. It is usually customary to put a notice in the church bulletin announcing the wedding and reception so nobody feels left out that they were not invited to the wedding that was held in their church.|`|AA10378447	I have been in churches that have the space to plan for it, yes.     People actually had more flexibility than they did with hotels and such, because they were able to bring in everything that they liked. Of course, you're right: there was no alcohol allowed. Also, many churches will have to approve your music choices for both the ceremony and reception events if you use their facilities. The weddings I have been to at churches were fine; not as "wild" as those outside of church buildings, of course. =)|`|sWudrXlfaa	my grandma was a wedding planner for over 25 years and i always used to go help her and a lot of them were in church buildings and looked very nice she had 2 or 3 big elegant backgrounds that covered walls and other things to make it look nice|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I had mine at my church.  We would have been allowed to bring in alcohol if we wanted to, but we just needed to get a license a month in advance.  Since we didn't like to drink, we didn't bother with it.  The church also had a sound system so we could set up music and had room to dance.  A lot of people told us they really liked the way the place looked.  I thought it was a good way to save money.  I've also seen people posting about needing to invite the church and post it in the church bulletin, but nobody at my church has ever done that.  Maybe it depends where you're located and how big the church is?    I was at a  reception that was held in a temple basement as well, and it was the same sort of thing as well.  I can't remember if they had alcohol, but they had room to dance and were able to play music.
j5V1zt9Maa	she might be messing with you. because it sounds like she really wants you back (wtf..locking your shoes to the desk..)     dont make the first move though cause she left you. now she has to tell  you that she likes you and you can go from there.|`|CpEOqbxdaa	sounds like she still likes you. either that or she is a big flirt! see if she acts that way around other guys and then you should be able to tell. if she doesn't then my guess is she likes you.|`|kQPQolVEaa	she might you are still attracted to her and she is just enjoying the attention. or she could just want to be friends with you and thats the way she behaves with friends.|`|llez7aU4aa	Well you are on the fence.

eHyXQSuvaa	the simple answer is dont  the complex answer is that we care about this person too much and no matter what they do to us we can easily forgive them beacuse when things are going right with them its an amazing feeling    and its kinda funny tat u asked this cuz i have this same questions as my status lol...|`|4NLNtQnsaa	thats really funny you ask this because that is exactly the phrase i put on my desktop once it was out that my husband had an affair. i was his option and i felt like crap. interesting.|`|dJs8GN3Qaa	When they consider you an option, don't make them a priority.

In any case, it is always best to keep your sexual preference to yourself at the workplace or even at school around people you don't know.  It is just nobody's business how you like to get freaky.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	More often than not confused girls putting a label on themselves so guys think they're hot.  Sorry.

And if EVERYBODY were straight then maybe we'd be way too over poplulated by now :O, maybe its destiny :O|`|klcqgST9aa	Personally, I think it's a bit ridiculous. I don't mean to be rude, but I will be honest. I think that bisexuality starts in middle school or so, when girls are growing faster than boys, are wanting sexual attention, but boys aren't mature enough, like boys are still afraid of girls and such, so instead of waiting, girls will release sexual energy any way they can, with other girls.     I think a lot of it is about safety, girls feel safe with other girls, they're more trusting. Boys can be players and can just want to get into pants, and girls are afraid of that, so they look to other girls.    Some girls do it for attention, because they want it. Boys think it's hot, so they do it.    I think most people grow out of it, but, who knows with this generation, where a third of people are bi. I think bi's are just lazy. Instead of waititng for the right person (heterosexually or homosexually) they look for any and everyone.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I'm cool with it.  Is that all you wanted to know?    if you want some scientific research on it.  The Kinsey Report has a sexuality scale and I believe the vast majority of people score on it as bisexual but do have a preference of one sex over the other.|`|N3U7xWAPaa	I am straight but i have Bi-friends and they are smazing (super amazing) i personally do not agree with it but whatever makes you happy is good|`|NSsPa8LQaa	hey, wuteva floats your boat!|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	i think that most people are bi to some extent yet favor one over the other.|`|AeOMHUwFaa	It's fine as long as you're not hurting anyone else. Im not personally, but I think it's a choice and as long as you're making up your mind and not saying "I think i like chicks, but maybe I like dudes too", you won't confuse yourself and the world around you.|`|8U1aivfwaa	hot in a gal   not cool in a guy|`|KZx1yVTPaa	Whatever floats your boat...in other words whatever makes you happy|`|QqL41s0Oaa	I see none fine wrong with it because i'm bi myself as well.|`|oQ7Ku9gqaa	I think that it's a personal choice and that everyone should stop putting people down who are bisexual.|`|d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	The more the merrier.|`|i9gjwPM6aa	If any one really cares then they are in secure|`|868rE46gaa	I have some immature friends that say "You're either straight or you're gay" but I also have a bisexual friend and I always say "Some people like chicken, some people like beef, some people like both." and I'm always right lol    Me personally: I love chicken and beef... but I'm straight lol    Just live! Don't worry about what people think. Be happy and live your life to the fullest! We're only here for a little while and you should make your time on Earth AMAZING!|`|99hfFssXaa	It's disgusting.  Same-sex relationships are disgusting.  Just my opinion|`|AA10223196	I am a christian.  The Bible teaches us in Leviticus 20:13 that bisexuality is an abomination and is frowned upon by God.  I guess it's okay if you're not spiritual and aren't concerned about life after death.  I don't just live for today. I accepted Jesus as my personal Savior and I fully expect to go to heaven when I die.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	The only opinion on your sexual orientation, that matters, is yours.|`|Mu3KpgX8aa	I always tell people that I'm not straight, gay, bi, whatever, I love someone because I love who they are, not because they are male or female.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	I'm going to quote my very wise 28 year-old son.  He says that "bisexuals are greedy and indecisive."   I mean no offense to you, but I think that's a pretty good assessment.
xpy442WPaa	My husband is really big too and I was a virgin when we first had sex.  It hurt (and bled!) a lot but just be gentle and keep trying. You may not be able to "finish" in her or even get all the way inside her the first couple times. Go slow and pay attention to how she's feeling and use LOTS of lube!  And put a towel underneath her the first couple of times to protect your sheets. Trust me, it gets a lot better with time and obviously, it's worth it to keep trying and get through the initial pain.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	it's very likely that it would hurt her no matter what the size. Most girls experience pain their first time and some even bleed.    Definitely use some lube. If/when you get it in, just stay still for a minute or so and make out.. this will give her some time to adjust. You'll have to go slow. It may take a few times for it to start feeling good for her. It took me like 5 times, my fiance is way bigger than me.     It's also possible that you won't be able to get all the way in... there is such a thing as too deep, if you hit her cervix it will hurt!    It's nice that you're such a sweetheart and don't want to hurt her!    Good luck!|`|pMsMx817aa	haha  oh jeez    uhh lube is always your friend mate!|`|CaPZrWVWaa	I'm actually a small girl, and before I lost it I did as much research as I could online.    A few websites suggested: girl on top. She can control the 'pain' herself. I know it doesn't sound as romantic as you 'taking her,' but its the best for her. If She can get you in comfortably, you can then change positions.    Thank you for being such a compassionate lover, caring about her comfort.      ****mblue, I totally agree with you! there is too deep. I have enough problems with tampons and them being too long.    Its not about 'driving' it all the way in.|`|DCXss6Odaa	So your 18.75 cm's long? - What are you doing on Y!A? - You need to get a job in a porno!  A vagina can push through a baby, I am sure it can handle your third leg?!?
mzIfJIQVaa	well when they laugh and say just kidding that usually means they dont really mean it, and when they are always talking to you afterwards and act like they are still your friends then they are just kidding but if they say it in a mean way and walk away it means they are serious and if they never talk to you and have a completely different set of friends than you that means they are serious|`|I24AuawZaa	Usually, depends what the guys like, and ohw much he is teasing.|`|CpEOqbxdaa	if you are a teenager. definitly yes!|`|gHmgBfwxaa	it can. it depends on the guy.|`|kZBKbMSUaa	Yes it means he likes her. Now in which way he likes her is the question.  Does he seriously like her or is it sexual attraction?|`|oldKepHXaa	How did he tease her it depends maybe he just doesn't like her or maybe he doesn't depend on what he said or did|`|1vCxa7pSaa	depends on the guy.|`|eUeTEmCeaa	depends what age|`|OmJdN2smaa	sometimes oh and PERRY THE PLATYPUS OWNS|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	it really depends. and the type of teasing. some are friendly and flirty other are def not signs that he's into. if you give an example that may help.|`|pj02ePxAaa	when a guy teases a girl, it usually means that they like her. you have some cases that they don't. one easy way to tell is if they make fun of you in a large group of people. that is a big indicator that they don't like you and are just embarassing you. another is if they act like they are laughing at you or with you. if they look at you and smile subtly, then they probably like you, if they laugh really loud and avoid eye contact, they probably don't. i hope this helps. ?|`|ArUtCrGlaa	what age is he? ages 7-12 yes, over no.... sorry.... he jsut hates ur guts..... not to be rude or anything. :)|`|O1fpr6LZaa	It depends. If you are not friends/sort of friends. He's probably flirting. If you are really close, he could just be messing with your because your good friends.|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	depends. my guys friends do that all the time to me. but they have girlfriends. you need a little more detail. hope i helped!!|`|R2BBjtaraa	it depends.    like i think guys usually smile if theyre tease-flirting lol|`|2BjpRnL0aa	most of the time YES. && he wants you to tease him back but watch out there is those bullies...
8d2f5bc0bffa96701367f0ce35248503aa	deep down... i honestly sometimes think my friends don't care for me too much... not only that, but despite how nice i am to all of them... they just kinda walk all over me. i love my friends, nonetheless, because they're have been occasions where i couldn't have asked for better... but i also feel the need to break away sometimes.    i totally know what you mean though. i'm pretty shy, and i think my other peers dislike that the most about me. i hope there's another person you can rely on as a friend for the time being... everyone needs a good friend.    & i'd definitely be your friend[=|`|IAbPBvHWaa	i think you should talk to you friend and ask wat is the matter that Will tell you if she is really 2 face and all the crap can get cleared out of the air and you can be friends with her but just not best friends anymore you sometime have to let ppl go|`|TZeKta4haa	don't worry about it you will get new friends!; )                     I'll be your friend! e-mail me!ill be online 4 a long time!!|`|TEwjD30xaa	try to forget them. i went through this too. just make new friends and show them off. the others will get jealous probably come over.
NaS3MrwSaa	No the sperm would not die, even if you use a condom   theres a chance it would break in the water.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	just use birth control pills for water.  like in shower , hot tub , etc.  and condom for dry like bed, couch , party , club.|`|838VJJGvaa	You should always use a condom unless you are trying to have baby.|`|o2dnH9WAaa	nope, need a condom. they wont be dead.|`|29TiPrpuaa	WHERE WERE YOU DURING SEX ED CLASS?!?!?!!     I mean seriously.    Everyone should know that, and that is totally stupid to ask. How old are you.. thirteen?    Gesus. no , they wont be dead. Dont ruin a childs life by getting accidently pregnate  like this.|`|llez7aU4aa	They won't die. Its a common missconception. Some will, but all you need is one to make it through. It is freaking awesome though so make sure you try it. You will find its actually better for the women because the heat makes it easier for you.|`|CpEOqbxdaa	you need a condom!!!!! the water thing is a lie. be careful please! please. its the worst feeling to be scared that your pregnant.|`|ppQbFWbWaa	Heat lowers the sperm count, but do you really want to chance it?  Have him wear the glove.|`|30MyrPl8aa	I doubt it. I don't think that it would have any effect at all...    Also, I worked for a pool company a few years ago - you don't want to get semen going on in the hot tub...you'd have to do a big clean up job after, can't just do it and it be alright, that'd be sin on the filter and whatnot. Not to mention you'd be sitting in cumwater. Gross.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	No.  Think about it.  The water is not going to be "up there" is it?  It's a kind of closed in area.  So it's the same as having sex out of water.  The sperm will reach the destination just like having sex anywhere else.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Not sure about the pregnancy thing, but I did have to fish out a girls nuvo ring out of my filter on time. Not too many girls really like it in the water, though. It seems to be a lubrication thing.    Get close, make out, have him sit up on the edge and blow his mind! (He will never forget it! I didnt!) Then move the show inside.|`|1IU0QCquaa	Definitely need a condom not only for the sperm, but also for safe sex!|`|830a86acc495e56c79b96209e023825eaa	The sperm would be alive and you could risk getting pregnant, plus it's not healthy for the girl to have sex in water. But it is fun.|`|b07DZioBaa	the high temprature in a hot tub instatly kills sperm there is only a tiny tiny chance of ever getting pregnant. and it is really hard to keep a condom on when your in the water so your best option is to go without but still make sure he pulls out.|`|piuEx0BJaa	NO! sperm can live up to 72 hours in hot tubs, pools, etc. Sperm stays alive in water.|`|6pyhnyZ6aa	Just use a condom|`|0utZQuyeaa	Nope. They'll still live for 3 days no matter what. Don't risk it.|`|D2t91OIYaa	Yu can still get pregant just have him wear a condom
d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	I've only had uncut sausage and I don't care as long as it is clean.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Most of the nerves are there,guys who are cut lose that .It really should be illegal. Rarely it is a medical necessity but usually if a guy needs to have it done it is a result of bad parenting.People who say it's dirty are ignorant or just full of sht and if they say it's a medical fact they are just plain liars.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	I agree. Take it from me cuz I'm a guy and you're right.|`|p0dxIZeSaa	makes no dif, its extra skin|`|jazKtgENaa	I thinks its gross|`|IuIp7Eevaa	im a guy, but still, i dont want to get my bits cut off! uncut all the way|`|llez7aU4aa	Yeah, its only bigger by a couple centimeters at most. Unfortunately, its not very clean so you are going to get a lot more infections down there. I hope you have good insurance because its been proven that you will get about 70% more infections from this.|`|o2dnH9WAaa	hurr? uh, doesnt make much difference...i guess? its a wee, whatevs.|`|5urfAbazaa	It doesn't make any difference to me.|`|77d8d8cd21849a9ea42ffd10b55a0c29aa	there's nothing wrong with being uncircumcised...it's your natural penis so it's how it's suppose to look. also, being uncircumcised, a guy has more pleasure during sex. we in america think it looks gross because circumcised penises are what we're use to seeing...however, as years go by, the amount of circumcisions or (genital mutilation) are decreasing greatly|`|OsHjXzxUaa	lol no it makes absolutely NO difference if someone is circumcised or not. its just that uncircumcised is alot dirtier and theres a much higher risk for infection with the flap and everything. but personally i think its kinda gross, uncircumcised is the way to go, deff..|`|TQ8Hbiv9aa	it looks gross, and it is actually gross because it allows for bacteria and other things to grow there...doesnt mean that the guy is gross but it gives opportunities for things like that to happen because it's harder to maintain clean...personally i like guys who are circumcised . by the way the size has nothing to do with that..|`|Yb99bIdnaa	It makes no difference to length, but because there's a double-layer of skin as it moves, it might feel thicker.    The big difference is less friction, a natural one is less likely to make you sore. Circumcision was popularized to prevent the "sin" of sexual pleasure, after all. If you've been chafed from a circumcised guy, congratulations, it's "working"!    As for the fearmongers who say it's dirty or infection-prone, that's simply not true. Infections can happen but they're very rare, and complications from circumcision surgery are actually more common.     You as a girl should know this -- your labia are there to protect your vagina, right? And you know that douching disrupts your natural flora and makes you more likely to get infections. Nature's got you covered! Don't listen to the xenophobes.|`|7q9MN1Wkaa	I don't think having foreskin affects the size of the penis.  Although, if a guy has a really thick skin, it would make the "head" look bigger if the skin is covering it.    Looks-wise, circumcised is better (except if the scar is really big & jagged). Most foreskins are kind of ugly or silly-looking. But I would go with Uncut over a crappy circumcision. Penises aren't very pretty in general, so the way it looks is not that important. More important is how it functions:    Foreskin is better for sex & handjobs (easier & more fun to play with). Sex with some cut penises can chaff, especially if u are a little dry! OUCH! The extra skin also acts like a ribbed condom, more ridges to feel. Some chicks say they can't tell the difference btwn cut & uncut for sex, but I can. Some guys may have a thin foreskin, so that may explain it. My BF has a thick one, so it definitely FEELS nicer than other cut guys I've had. With a condom, it's less noticeable.    Now, for oral, circumcised is the winner. Foreskins feel kinda weird & mushy in the mouth & they have a stronger smell. Unless the guy has JUST stepped out of the shower, I can always detect that "smegma-ish" scent. Not too say that it's horrible or anything, 'coz women's privates smell even stronger. But I HAVE been with both varieties who had less than perfect hygiene & I can tell u........I almost got turned-off foreskin for LIFE. The cut guy still smelled bad, but nowhere NEAR the uncut one!    So, fellas, pls keep those turtle-necks clean!!|`|ronomgTIaa	i had a guy that was uncut, made no difference to me. it just looked a bit different thats all.|`|Pxf5VvIUaa	ugh i think they are disgusting...|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I think that all men have different sizes. Just because he wasn't snipped doesn't necessarily mean that the unsnipped ones are bigger.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Only seen pictures of uncircumcized but I would say they aren't attractive at all. Who cares if it feels better or not, I wouldn't let those things anywhere near me. lol|`|nVsWK6CCaa	It looks better cut, thats all|`|M4X3HOV5aa	its not bigger its just wearing a turtle neck.|`|al79fWZzaa	I've never seen one, but somehow the idea grosses me out. What's it like?|`|fWq57D4Vaa	uncut ones look wierd, but, I'm american and dont see uncut ones much. Uncut guys cant even get into porn in america.|`|8db1pu95aa	the skin doesn't make it bigger or smaller. I've dated 2 guys who were uncut. I thought it was kinda icky but I liked the guys|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	only ever had one guy and he was uncut never worried me cos he knew how to use it.|`|jOFRD9sLaa	correct me if I'm wrong, but don't women also have foreskin?
yGwda7wPaa	It sounds to me like she is very worried about you.  After your parents divorced, she probably feels a lot more responsibility.  If you sister was pregnant at such a young age, she is probably worried that the same thing will happen to you.  Do you have any kind of relationship with your dad?  Maybe there is a way for you to go to a counselor.  Perhaps you could mention it to your mom, that you think you argue a lot and would like to see a counselor with her.|`|PoHpSqwwaa	It looks as if she's taking her anger out on you , and that's probably it. There's a chance she may just be concerned  about you, but i doubt that. You should tell her in a very calm and serious voice how you feel about her meddling in your business  , If she doesn't calm down after that  I suggest  You tell someone about this like a  teacher. Or maybe just call the Maury show|`|UYLuMT7haa	Dude that sucks, I am sorry your mom is such a snoop. Me and my mom don't have a very good relation either, but me and my older sister do, and that gets me through alot. My older sister is also reallly close to my mom, so sometimes its hard. My mom has also gotten a divorce, and is sometimes, well not considerate to what i do. What i would do in your situation, is if your close to either of you older siblings talk to them about it, and if they agree with you then they will perhaps talk some sense into your physo mother. If your not close to either of you siblings then maybe you should ask your mother to come in your room and you need to talk to her, tell her your growing up, your a good girl, and you need your space, also mention that you want to have a good relation with her, its just shes not allowing you to get close to her. And about you being really sensitive, your going to have to grow out of that, lifes hard, esp when your mom is rough. You shouldnt care what people think of you, dont get your feelings hurt, just becuz someone tells you to shut up. I hope all goes well with her.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I'd adopt U if I could ...........then U could tell my two daughters about what a really mean mother is like. I am so laid back with my girls, and they think I am terrible. They have no clue how nice I am. I have only snooped thru their rooms a couple of times, and it was because I was worried sick about something bad happening to them, so I was checking on a few things for that reason. I would not dream of checking up on their computer sites. It is hard for a caring mom to watch her children hang out with really bad kids who might get them into trouble. But I have let them make a lot of their own mistakes -- which breaks my heart but I believe in giving them as much freedom as possible.   As to the unfairness with your siblings --- I feel sorry for U --- but that is common sometimes. I don't know why some parents do this, they obviously have problems of their own.  Just know that U will grow up and be shed of your mom at some point.   It broke my heart when my oldest wore a T-shirt that said "Even My Mother Is Afraid of Me" I loved her so much, and never tried to show favoritism. She even ran away from home for two years and broke my heart. Now that she is in collage she has started being nicer to me. But her younger sister is 17 now, and tries my patience daily.  I really feel for you. Please know that all parents are not like this, and find your own world to live in. By that I mean to have inner peace within your own heart and know that it is your mom -- not you -- who has the real problem. Try to be respectful to her even if U think she does not deserve it, because it will give her less to gripe about. Find friends who will support U. What about some kind teachers or adult relatives? Reach out and find ways to make your life happy in spite of your mom's poor attitude. You will be a better and stronger spirit in the long run. Some day U will escape. Just do not do something like run away or have a crummy boyfriend to ease your pain. We are here for you.
M4X3HOV5aa	you need a  boyfriend|`|N3U7xWAPaa	hmm . that happened to me when they come onto facebook ask them if they received your message and if they say yeah then ask them what they're answer is and if they take a while to answer then they were avoiding it and they don;t want to hang out with or they feel bad that they made plans with on the weekend and then made plans with someone else (both have happened to me )  she mostly isn't ready to hang out with you yet keep contact with her and talk to her more at the club and if she does not want to have anything to do with you then don't worry about it keep being nice to her at the club  don't make her your enemie     lucck !|`|rAeJ74Neaa	to me it sounds like a harsh rejection and that is unfair to you, it seems too soon to confront her and ask why she has not replied but at the same time you want to know. Maybe you should just ask her why she has not responded and what you said wrong. If you are to see her again face to face it would be easier and you know she'll respond that way .
T8OFsBUUaa	If I heard something about my friend that i believed to be untrue, I would probably mention it them. If it turned out to not be true, and someone was spreading rumors, I figure she has the right to know who it is, so she can confront them, or at least know not to trust them with secrets or anything anymore.|`|TEwjD30xaa	tell them. they'd wanna know.|`|5BbxO5U9aa	All of the above|`|yuIb3XwPaa	tell em what you heard they have a right to know .

Exercise portion control.  Eat what you want, even if it's horrible for you, but eat it in a small quantity.  Instead of eating 5 or 6 cookies, eat 1.    2.  Stay active!  Make sure you're getting plenty of exercise.  Go for that romantic "long walk on the beach" and make sure it's extra long to burn some of those calories!|`|ybNa4oubaa	Live a little! you're on your honey moon! In Jamaica at that! Some people would die to be in your shoes. My advice is to eat all you can and all you wan't. I'm sure your husband will understand, plus he shouldn't mind if you put on a few extra pounds. If you're that  concerned do a liitle excercise, go to the hotel gym or better yet do a little extra swimming, challenge him to a game of tennis or some other sport or even go jogging down the beach with your hubby as the sun sets. No matter what you do, stop worrying about superficial stuff and have fun, afterall this may just be a once in a lifetime experience!  Ps: Congrats!
3L1Drbj5aa	Well you're never going to convince your parents it wasn't a big deal. trust me, I know. My parents grounded me for 2 whole months because I forgot to make brownies for a family party. Umm tell him exactly what happened. Say you were completely beat, her parents said it was ok. Offer to call them and let them talk to your dad. I would say "I understand what I did was wrong and I'm really sorry. I also understand I need a punishment but I'm not positive on what you want. I was thinking being grounded for this weekend, but I wanted your input. What do you think?"|`|yGwda7wPaa	Well, the real problem is that you lied.  If you didn't think it was a problem, you wouldn't have lied.  So, maybe your punishment should be either staying home this weekend, or doing something nice for your dad.  Is there anything you could help him with?  Shovel snow, clean the garage, etc.
3652865bf75234629480db3292c40bc6aa	On our 4th Valentines Day, we had purchased a house that was a real money pit. Plus, we were paying off the hospital for the birth of our first child. We were so broke we couldn't even afford cards, let alone presents. When I got home from work, I snuck in the house and upstairs to the bedroom. I stripped and tied a big red ribbon (left over from Christmas) around my parts and snuck back down to the kitchen. I found our son on the table in his bouncer chair and my wife cooking in nothing but 3 red paper hearts strategically taped to the front of her body. Dinner was put off til later. It was a very fine night together. We have had 39 Valentine Days since then, but that one is still the best.|`|IVsUfHENaa	HUM , all husband want that is a good ***!?|`|7YdYYpLZaa	put a frog in his pant...

I wanted to surprise him but with Valentine's falling on a Saturday this year it would be too hard.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Anal.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I will tell what my wife surprised me with on our first valentines day after we were married. It was unusual to say the least.  While I was at work, my wife had made up two large red cardboard hearts.  On them she wrote 'I LOVE YOU'.  When I came home she was wearing them as posters completely naked underneath.  I must say those posters didn't stay on long and we had most passionate lovemaking I can remember in 37 years of marriage.  I don't know if you want to do that but be original
Mfq8seVxaa	KaliGirl,    What i would do is give him chocolate, a teddy bear, or any kinds of stuff.  Don't get him flowers though.  Thats a man thing ;p|`|CpEOqbxdaa	take your boyfriend to dave and busters. im taking my boyfriend there and im gonna pay for the games. itll be fun. then with that give him candy and a sweet card. gl|`|KmaXKjuHaa	POWER TOOLS, a nice dinner and a valentines day card. Keep it under $100. Ask his mom or dad, ask friends.|`|1vCxa7pSaa	Just get candy.    or, whatever you expect from him.  DO you expect candies from him, then get candies for him. And if you've only been dating three weeks, then it shouldn't be anything too big or too serious.  OH wait, I love that mix CD idea, do that, and like, some candy  That would be uber cute.|`|KcloaW4vaa	Straight from my mouth, " ALL GUYS DO NOT CARE WHAT WE GET FOR VALENTINE'S DAY." This is the utter truth because we really just wind up going crazy with what to get our girl and the best gift of all is just knowing that she liked the gift... for the most part.  Honestly, i would say get him a necklace or bracelet. Thats all i would really want.|`|D2t91OIYaa	Just get him a bear and a card or make one|`|DbNbWQflaa	go to the arcade|`|rno6XarMaa	Nothing...you've been dating 3 weeks.  A card or a mixed CD of songs you both like sounds good.  Guys usually don't give a rat's *** about V Day anyhow.|`|8bETrOtqaa	Buy him something that fits his style or something you know he would enjoy, but don't buy anything to expensive and chocolate is always a plus
WDs4fRoxaa	He is never going to know how you feel unless you tell him.    You have to tell him that he is starting to make you feel uncomfortable by showing so often and unannounced.    Explain that you do not mind when he shows up to pick up his son, but he should refrain from showing up when it is not his day to pick him up.    You can email him...he will get it the next time that he shows up in front of your house to use your wifi signal.    Best wishes|`|aXJQadp6aa	I think he wants to be around his son and might secretly want you back.    Guys respond to directness, not nagging. I would suggest simply telling him in a nice way.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Just tell him. Next time he's there, let him know that you don't mind him coming over once in a while, but that from now on he needs to call you first to make sure that you are going to be there and that you are in the mood for guest. My guess would be that he still loves you and wants to be with you. And you said he's not a bad guy., so why not get back together with him?|`|7b98229ae13a8cd3f0b0f8525bd0dea9aa	it may be that it is you rather than your child that the man is interesting on how do i say "keeping track of".  the best way ive learned to  deal with situations such as this is to be as honest with them along with yourself.  the only one who truly knows whats going on is you.  you already know what you have to do.|`|o4kkU2kSaa	JUST LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM ALWAYS COMING OVER YOUR HOUSE UNEXPECTEDLY. THAT YOU APPRECIATE HIM FOR BEING IN YOUR SONS LIFE BUT HE IS VISITING TOO MUCH AND YOU CAN'T HAVE THE COMPANY THAT YOU WANT WITH HIM STICKING AROUND SO MUCH! HE PROBABLY STILL LOVE YOU THOUGH GIRL THE REASON WHY HE IS LINGERING AROUND YOUR HOUSE SO MUCH!|`|EQvY3tQqaa	i think you need to say everything you said in your question to him.  I am not saying be mean to him.  just explain your position and tell him honestly that you need your space.  his feelings might be hurt a little. he'll get over it, I don't know your situation but it sounds like somone is having a little trouble letting go and the only way he is going to get it is if you say something.|`|53LFDUvYaa	hes 8 dude :S|`|PUXmTrnMaa	Sounds like the best answer is to tell him it makes you uncomfortable for him to "hang around" so much. You have your own life and it throws a wrench in it for him to lurk around your door. You have a right to your privacy. If he doesn't respect that, threaten him with a restraining order. Start out nice but stand your ground if you have too. He will more than likely back off if you are strong.|`|jfDggfMCaa	How about,  "You need to leave me more space,I'll bring the kids over you if needed.You need to understand,even if it was mom I'd mind her always around.Home is home to me,and just our son...Please,do not cat-mark all over".  Guys will get the line easier delivered,but firm.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	i'm not sure there's any EZ way 2 confront him. i'm sure u don't mind occasionally, but not all the time. however, when he shows up, start by UNPLUGGING yer WI FI modem. u can even do so when yer away.    another idea is try B'n away from home more & more.    When U R home, LOCK yer doors so he cannot walk in. You have a right to your privacy.
TZw9Q7pOaa	If he is leaving don't bother to tell him, unless you think it will change things.  Like him staying because he feels the same way as you.|`|qfzcSWCnaa	I think that u should...it is better to tell him now instead of never and then for the rest of ur life it will be questions about i wonder wat would have happened if....so tell him before its too late and ur question lead u to insanity!|`|hs793CCxaa	and you put this in Marriage and Divorce because?.......|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	UH I think it was time to tell him 5 years ago by now you would of been married and had a couple of kids and a house with double garage, get the picture???????????|`|BzH7l27oaa	Wrong section|`|AA11603829	5 years...what are you in jr. high? He is moving and you should just let him move. Maybe give him a good bye "present".|`|AnW3dzQfaa	5 years??  If he was a real man then he would have already approached you by now.  He probally just liked flirting with you and you thought that he liked you this whole time.  Don't worry a new man will come along.

I never seen that in my life, and also they might be pretty to you (weird) but to that boy she isn't.  Why do you say "guys"? All guys aren't like that and if you think so your sexiest, you should have said some guys in my school.
CBa9G4j4aa	Not in order!    1.)Tease him  2.)Cover his eyes and make him guess who  3.)Jump on his back for a piggy back  4.)Tell him he's cute  5.)Take something of his so he chases you for it  6.)Tickling!  7.)Any way to make him laugh  8.)Write silly things like "You're my boyfriend" on their hand  9.)Make them accidentally hurt you so you get a hug =]  10.)Look at them in the eyes and smile|`|CpEOqbxdaa	1- touching them  2- calling them names  3- sticking out my tongue  4- making faces   5- doing helpful things for them  6- texting   7- laughing alot  8- being cute   9- talk to them about silly things  10- tickeling|`|SqWJCZyeaa	What I do with my crush is NEVER EVER seem uncomfortable with him or make anything akward. I always smile around him, and he always smiles around me. You need to laugh when he does something funny or stupid. (Only if he wants you to laugh).  Get your friend or somebody to tell him that you like him. Then when he looks at you, smile, and look away. It worked for me! He asked me out! EEEPPPP!|`|2Cvdu454aa	1)smile a lot  2)a lot of contact - but not too much  3)alcohol helps you relax so why not have a drink eehy ;)  4)laugh  5)do something embarrasing and act cool about it  6)be really open about things - if they start talking about sex and stuff like that join in haha  7)start an interesting conversation or maybe even a debate  8)if your dancing, dance close  9)keep looking at them EYE CONTACT  10)if they compliment you do this big wide eyed look as if to say 'omg you think!' and then look down and smile    they work for me haha|`|oldKepHXaa	1)Walk passed them with a seductive look in our eye.

pAyl6M1faa	get some confidence dude!  no girl is too good for you.  you just need to  talk to them like you are confident about who you are, and what you want out of life.  chics like guys who can be themselves, show humor, and act in control of their lives and emotions.    age has nothing to do with girls liking you. i dated a women who was over 14 years older than me, and we got along very well.|`|SGjhNidDaa	if you're confident, girls can sense it.  be friendly, be funny, but most of all be confident. we can smell fear sooo well. even if you're shaking scared, pretend, FAKE IT!!|`|oldKepHXaa	ok this is what i do. First try making Friend with her take it slow as hell or whatever but if you get use to being around her then you ll be able to talk to her about things try helping her with stuff|`|pj02ePxAaa	you need to raise your self-esteem. there is nothing sexier than confidence, as long as you don't over do it. don't wanna be a cocky know it all. good luck. ?|`|cyxkeBhYaa	I think you should just talk to her, maybe get to know her more. She might figure out that she really likes you too. Also i know many people who have date 6 yrs. older or youger and 4 yrs. too, so don't think that she might not be into you. You just never know. She also might be saying the same things. I hope this helped you!|`|7JmVnwSNaa	Take it slow... try to find out a little more about her, like her interest, hobbies, where she shops...ext. Once you get to know more about her you can compare your hobbies & interest to yours to see if you have things in common before you make a move.Here's a tip... let's say your the kind of guy who wares pants that are so baggy there practically around your ankles and you have that kinda gangsta look. Lets say she likes guys who ware Hollister , American eagle & Abercrombie & fitch clothes... AKA the preppy or modern guys. Don't change just because of her JUST BE YOURSELF you shouldn't go on living your life trying to be who someone else wants you to be. its not worth it. Believe me I've been there! It sucks.     HERE'S THE REST OF YOUR ADVICE...  if you guys share some of the same interest make a move (make sure your ready) DON'T MAKE A FOOL OF YOUR SELF. Just take it slow and be cool. And guess what???... GIRLS ARE JUST AS SCARED TO TALK TO GUYS ABOUT DATING AND LOVE AND FEELINGS AS YOU ARE. she will understand. I'LL Keep checking back to see if you have another question about you Problem.     MY BEST REGARDS AND WISHES....Good Luck!    Rachel|`|66tpufsgaa	talk to her, become her friend and see if she likes you or not first|`|a55CPBtRaa	You need to be more confident first of all.

Find some things in common that you both share, then talk about it. Get her to laugh. A girl loves it when a guy has a sense of humor. Just remember to take things slow and to breathe!
rno6XarMaa	Get up and leave the table; go do what you feel like doing.    Sounds rude, but it isn't.  If they blow off your opinions and input, making you feel dumb in the process, they are the ones who need to change, not you.  If they ask why you stopped hanging out for the chats, tell them.    In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt to brush up on current events.  No, you don't need to be an expert in every brainiac subject to hold your own in an intellectual conversation.  As long as you read the front section of the paper each day or watch the evening news, you can at the very least be well-informed and share opinions.  This will help you in your outside relationships too.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	try 2 c this as a LEARNING opportunity. u can LISTEN & LEARN. try asking rel8ed questions about what u hear. this is how u gain knowledge. this is ALL part of relationships if u can learn 2 connect.       i have a friend who's becoming a florist. i dunno much about flowers, but i was taught 2 listen, learn, & ask questions about the other person's interests, EVEN THO it's NOT yer interest. this is parta BONDING. if u learn 2 speak their lang, u'll fare better in life, & u'll get MUCH further. ppl wanna B around brainiacs more than ppl who lack knowledge. Y do u think astronauts (as I've heard) don't wanna B bothered? b/c they speak their own lang. if u don't speak their lang, they cannot connect w/ us. i'm a future astronaut, & i find it nearly impossible 2 find ppl who speak my lang. i find it hard 2 connect if i cannot find ppl w/ whom 2 connect. i visited a NASA base this summer & i felt right @ home so much 2 the point i spoke mostly w/ the workers that day. i felt even more @ home when i met a 'fellow' astronaut. i just didn't wanna leave & i just wanted 2 B around my future work family. i just felt so @ home i woulda stayed til closing if i didn't live so far away.
9dJqoV9Laa	ah! i TOTALLY understand how annoying that is. i'm 18, and my dad was the same way until i was like 17. for real. he made me give him my myspace username and password and told me that if i didn't, i wasn't allowed on his computer. :/ and i wasn't doing anything bad online, i just wanted privacy. so i made a new account. haha.  and if there was serious things i wanted to talk about, that i didn't want my dad to read/know about, i made sure i told everyone to use my other account. hope this helps. i know how you feel, my dad used to like go through my texts/calls on my phone too. :/ lol|`|ACOsW9ytaa	Well he probs just wants to check there's no weirdos talking to you! Why don't you see if you can show him your page instead of him having the pass word?|`|e9t9SX9daa	well i dont have a facebook but i would delete anything thats bad and then just say you forgot ur password.|`|QwLVWYkeaa	if you cant show your daddy your page then that means you have somehting to hide.  to get around it, you should make a pg-13 page just in case you are getting down and dirty online|`|AA11185479	He wants to monitor your account and make sure you are using it safely and appropriately.    For example, he wants to make sure your MySpace friends are perverts or spammers or people who are otherwise trying to take advantage of your innocence.  Another example - he wants to make sure you aren't posting anything inappropriate, such as provocative photos of yourself, personal information like your address or school.      Even if you don't do any of this, he has no way of knowing that, so he needs to check.  Compromise by suggesting he create his own private MySpace profile, and add you as a friend.  That way he can monitor your page without controlling access to it.

8f3269a830e3b8642cf1c15c965ce17baa	I remember my first kiss... real kiss...      It was positively electric.  I never wanted to stop -- and didn't for about an hour... or more.... (is it getting hot in here???)    First off, don't plan it.  And don't say to yourself, "Okay, we're going to French kiss now".  If he's not a total schmuck, he'll kiss you gently to see if you're receptive.. then again... then again with a little more emotion... and next thing you know...Yum.      Just DON'T PLAN IT.    Don't worry about feeling like you have to be a pro.  The joy of kissing is the discovery of the thing.  It's different with everyone.  It's more the combination of the TWO of you than you having skills... and him having skills.  It's a relationship... just a different way of communicating.  Do it with your heart, and you can't go wrong.    Don't sweat it.... You'll be fine.  : )|`|CpEOqbxdaa	basically for the first time its gonna feel weird!     first just get your lips together    then     like move them around     use tongue if you like     but watch movies. the way it looks is the way its done.     becarefull not to be too get to much spit on them|`|SqWJCZyeaa	When you kiss sneak your tongue in.

Just part your lips and make sure you don't close your eyes until your lips are actually on each others because first times can be very awkward if you miss the other person's lips, lol! It's very easy and it's extremely hard to screw it up! Good luck!! =]     When you feel comfortable just let your tongue slide in and massage him...and if you don't know what to do with it, spell the ABC's on his tongue...that always works, haha.    Oh and make sure that your breath smells good!|`|3ctchU2faa	First, you need another pair of lips. Second, it needs to belong to someone you like/love.     Ready, set, TONGUE WRESTLE!|`|J8lfBZaxaa	they're all right.  it's done just as it sounds: touching tongues while kissing.  but not the tips, the middle part.  that's the sensual part of the kiss.  if you just go at them with the tip of your tongue it will feel like you're trying to lick them.  just relax, take a deep breath, and know that when you're with someone  you really care about, the kissing-in all its forms-will come naturally.  Good Luck!|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Obviously, the best way would be for me to show you, but to explain:    You have to move in slowly.    Your mouth should be open a little, like you're saying the word, "of".    Start with just lips.    Then, do the tongue tickle.  In and out, but not rhythmically.    Just a little, at first.    Then your head will get a little dizzy.    Increase the tongue movement and give a little more.    Be careful not to overdo the tongue though.  It may intimidate the guy or even gross him out.    Remember, less is more.    After 30 seconds, position your bodies closer together.    Put your arms around his neck.    If he seems nervous, but still into it, take his hand and...    Well, I guess the rest comes naturally.|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HOLE FRENCH KISS THING BUT I KNOW HOW TO ENGLISH KISS.  LOL JUST PLAYING   JUST GO ON KISS IN SLOW FEEL OUT HIS OR HER MOVEMENTS AND FLOWER THE WAY THEY DO IT     GOOD LUCK FROM DOCTOR LOVE|`|pCg5JWqPaa	Freshen your breath. You never want to have bad breath when you are about to kiss someone, whether the kiss is a French kiss or not. Because your mouth will be open in a French kiss, fresh breath is especially important. Practice good dental hygiene. Carry mints with you if you think there is even so much as a hint of a chance you might kiss.   Teeth are a sensitive subject. You definitely do not want to bump teeth with each other. It is not only awkward, but can hurt as well. It might inevitably happen at times, so do not worry when it does. You may want to try rubbing the backs or fronts of the teeth of the other person with your tongue. This can create a ticklish feeling that might enhance your kiss. Not everyone enjoys having someones tongue rubbing on their teeth, and many do not like to touch teeth with their tongue.   Not everybody likes to be kissed the same way, so while your former partner might have enjoyed one method of kissing, your new love might not. You need to learn to read signals and adapt to a style that's comfortable for each each of you. This works in reverse, too. Just because someone doesn't kiss you like you are used to does not mean they are a bad kisser. As long as you are comfortable with the kiss, try to be open-minded, as you just might like the new style.   Be an active partner. If someone is French kissing you and you want them to do so, do not just sit there but get into the kiss.Reciprocate their actions, and alternate taking the lead on the movements of your tongues and lips. If you are uncomfortable with any part of the kiss, do not be afraid to pull away or gently close your lips. This will give your your partner the hint.   There are no rules for how long you should hold a kiss. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, break the kiss; otherwise, just enjoy it until one or both of you slowly pull apart, usually together. It is extremely romantic to lightly suck your partner's upper or bottom lip as you part. You might find yourselves returning to kissing, after each of you takes a breath.|`|AA11404315	Step into my office|`|GITXvGaIaa	if your in love with that person you will know the right time   and the kissing part, it will come naturally.|`|cUd8JK2paa	When u kiss put ur tongue with theyr tongue......easy as h e double l      Answer this plz:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/indez;...|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	you just put some tongue action into it.|`|VH07duDnaa	First of all you need to learn how to spell.   it's easy just KISS him!
uGN7Lmg0aa	"He also blurted out to me that we would never date because we don't get a long"    You can argue over definitions, but at the end of the day, whatever his problem with you is, it's a dealbreaker.  If you want to fix it then you have to find out what he actually means.  My guess is you have frequent disagreements or spats that he takes more seriously (from a relationship perspective) than you do.  Whatever it is, my guess is also that you're probably not going to want to change it.    As far as dating the other girl -- I could well imagine a scenario where he wants to date her but she is only interested in hanging out as friends.  Or vice versa.  In a nutshell, I would need to see more evidence to believe he is actually lying to you, but he is obviously not being exactly open about his feelings either.  He may feel it's none of your business since it has been established you are just friends.    The flirting bad and backing-off thing is something I usually am tempted to do with a woman I am attracted to, but that I don't have high hopes of being able to sustain a relationship with.  Thus, the mixed signals.    If I were you I would pursue other men and work through this guy's issues with you as a lower priority.  Or just accept the friendship for what it is and move on.    P.S. it wasn't a mistake to tell him.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	who cares? he already sounds like bull to me. Don't waste anymore of your time on him, I'm sure it's reasons just like this, that he got divorced. Move on and leave this worthless creep alone.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	I don't think he wants to be in a real relationship with you, but he doesn't want to ruin the chance of possibly being in a sexual relationship with you. He is basically keeping himself available in case he wants to make a move. No guy is going to take himself off the market unless he is in a serious relationship.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	I think he is only interested in you as a friend. Find other guys. He is not worth it. Any guy who likes to play around will eventually play around with you in the end and break your heart.|`|jkKICuXhaa	Sounds to me like he's trying to keep you on the back burner in case all else fails.|`|pE0lUbAFaa	Hes an idiot, and honestly not worth your time....move on...|`|VnpAZTCDaa	have u ever met the other girl 2 ask her if she was dating him or not , if u havent, then u just have 2 assume that if he says hes not dating her then she must be just a booty call|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Hate to say it, but basically if he's available and he's not trying to get into your pants he's not attracted to you. Sounds like he likes being your friend but doesn't want to get committed with you.
zzUgYFy4aa	you told us complete strangers on YA that you .. I quote "I love my boyfriend." but you can not tell him. Sounds like you should end this right now. You are not being mature enough to handle a relationship.  Honesty should be your main goal. So be honest with yourself!!
RavvDVpVaa	I've sprayed a couple of my friends down with a fire extinguisher, because they probably would have killed each other|`|2Mvrxdn7aa	i'm gonna start to break it up, but if they wanna really fight and I get hurt in the process, i'm gona let em fight and leave so they can just look stupid at each other when they are done.,|`|86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	I'd try to break it up.  If that fails, I'd let them keep going until they get tired.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	Do my best to break it up.|`|mmwrvvk1aa	beat the crap out of both of them and get them to stop fighting|`|YogATwEoaa	Pull them apart. A-DUH :||`|8p8Hy3YBaa	Let them fight it out, good chance after they do it, they will have solved their differences with fighting, and should resume being friends.|`|o0GQUIXlaa	lmao yo i agree with halo dude  beat em both up teach em a lesson|`|7d6bbdba5b9569b2686b8347a945922caa	throw water on them, or get help, sometimes freinds need a good beating, or sit back and watch the whole thing untill one pulls out a knife|`|mtuZ3i7haa	I would shout really loud to get their attention and try to calm them down|`|Z7xZT9PUaa	i would ask them why they were fighting and then i would make them stop and apologize to each other :]|`|mDiVxhc3aa	laugh and let them fight they will be Friends the next day.|`|HGadAqG9aa	I would get them both laughing. try farting while they are fighting or saying some funny joke.|`|crnjv96Faa	get my vieo camera lol, im just playing    break it up, try to make them talk it out and what happened etc|`|Niygpxktaa	Get popcorn?                          ; )    (sorry, couldn't help it)
MzqZGvalaa	He sounds a little immature.  But yeah, I think one of the things about a true friend is that you annoy each other at times, but it doesn't matter.  You will never meet a person, not one single one honey,who doesn't give you the hump every now and then.  When you're older your partner will be annoying, when you're young your parents are annoying, and in between your friends are annoying, later in life your kids get annoying, but we still love all these annoying people.  Because they love us, and we're annoying too.  Just ignore the little stuff, save your energy for the biggies.  Give him space, he'll come good in a day or two.  The good thing about blokes is most of them have very short attention spans, ha ha.|`|pLCLtbtFaa	That happens a lot with me and my best friend. :]  It's normal..  Maybe your friend found out about you or something you did, and he is mad at you for it or something? I don't know. There are many reasons why. Usually it just passes and you are friends again.|`|5BbxO5U9aa	Give him space he is probably having a bad day|`|unlpwEDMaa	just stop being annoying...duh.|`|TsFG4zLmaa	Guy friends are the best.  He may just be kidding.  If you give him a day or two and he acts different, or says it again ask him whats up? but don't make a big deal about it|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	It's happened to me the other way around. I've gotten annoyed by my best friend but don't worry this story had a happy ending. I say you just give him his space. After awhile things will be back to normal, if not, better. :]|`|oQ7Ku9gqaa	It might not have been all you. Maybe something else was bothering him and you being annoying made it worse. Or maybe it was just you. I would ask him about it. To see if he was just having a bad day or if there is a big problem between you two.|`|AA12198711	If they are not friend enough to let you know then they are not a true friend. Simple as that dear.     What he told yo today was distasteful and childish.     Walk in the other direction, make knew friends and don't look back.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Give him some space...he'll come around|`|7lDsUXEmaa	Just give him space and then talk to him.....|`|qkIYsMU7aa	yea that just happened to me today! all i did was ask her why she was mad at me and she told me so that's one way|`|zVrQILmlaa	Well sometimes space is a good thing, it might just be that's what needs. We have our off days. I don't think its a serious problem so I wouldn't worry too much. But it also might be a good idea to try to ask him whats wrong and how to fix the problem.   Its happened to be before and I've been on both ends. He mights just be having a bad day. If he's still upset in a few days than try to talk to him alone and see whats wrong.
domEftoIaa	if he does not like you then im sorry to say this but you need to move on there is no sense in wasting your time on a guy that doesn't like you. good luck!!!
AnW3dzQfaa	Which country are you talking about going to?|`|rm1oLtNtaa	Money (travelers checks) , passports.. hotel reservations|`|K1xNKSYxaa	a 220 watt converter.  You'll need it!|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	The way this world is right now, I would say guns, M16's  or bushwacker 223 cal. and a couple thousand rounds of ammo, also you each need some dragon skin body armor, and a steel band permanently fastened around your neck, that way they cant chop your heads off !
elVDYy7eaa	How exactly does one "GO LAURREN"?|`|1vCxa7pSaa	um, its like he is saying hi.   because, he is.  It is your name, right?|`|oldKepHXaa	He calling you maybe he likes you and wants your attention|`|9c40eaa9939b61f8b2a2080ce89b4c22aa	You're an idiot.|`|BZOhW7vhaa	hahahahahahah|`|MtQ9ea2Uaa	You're not funny.|`|xEowac5Kaa	because he's greeting you....     seriously.... don't read into things so much. jeesh.|`|AA11263103	he likes you  lol My name is Lauren too|`|KQjhOdsIaa	huh|`|fe730f7457a84c5c53a41d445c46f630aa	because he is excited to see you.
tK7XacH7aa	You should really talk to her about this. She may not know your upset, but if you try to solve the problems together you could get father in the relationship. If you don't fix this, then you two will eventually break up because you will be tired of one another. Don't be too direct though because you may offend her which could cause more problems. Just talk to her openly about what happens and don't accuse her of anything and use "we" all the time instead of "you." If you use "You" then it will feel like an attack.|`|xbwz1Ozwaa	For fun.|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	shes a woman. Need i say more|`|jPALIEzLaa	maybe she likes to get you riled up. it might be kinky to her or something like that. ;)|`|jhHAolCGaa	because girls are complicated and impossible to understand. thats the best answer in the world bro.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Maybe for the attention, or to create tension or drama.  Girls just love to do that sort of thing.|`|yeu09pfOaa	Probably cause you do things to piss her off ....|`|sxImRCT5aa	have you ever thought she is using you or have you told her that tell her the truth|`|hazucBxbaa	it must turn her on when your mad..thats why i piss my bf some times cuz i like when he is mad..or she could just want you to break up with her idk.ask her|`|rZhUcLFmaa	It's in her personality. Maybe she has a personality disorder (e.g. BPD).     You can't really change a persons nature, you'll just have to get used to it or find someone who meshes with you better.|`|H4FMzagxaa	um... Matt?    haha this could be my bf.  I know when I do it i feel awful after.  I so wasn't thinking and I would do anything to take it back.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	She is testing you to see if she can break you, all women do it, if you get upset and angry, she is winning and will probably dump you soon.|`|AA12081690	Spice|`|QmpobMj7aa	I know a lot of girls like this. They crave drama and attention. If you're fighting with her, then all your attention is on her...and she has something to talk about to her friends.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Maybe she doesn't want to be controlled by your moods.|`|7jpaOKu2aa	She could be doing this to get attention from you im not sure tho, shoot i argue with my boyfriend cause it turns me on in a way im not sure how but it does...seriously lol. So maybe try giving her more attention, hope this helps|`|PrpizvQbaa	All women are the same lol|`|RCpS5H4eaa	Girls are complex but my guess is you did something to get her annoyed or mad or sad and shes simply getting back at you in a more settle way than just starting a fight.|`|RhjulglGaa	break up with her because she obviously doesnt care about how you feel shes not worth it.|`|RgZ5n0b4aa	some girls just do things because they want attention give her some more attention maybe things will change but you have to realize were girls we're put on this world for u to love us and hate us at the same time =]|`|hFX5UQGdaa	Maybe its because shes a woman|`|dBDxfrLFaa	maybe she is just trying to get attention.. it depends.. it can be that but it can also be other things|`|zIrTm8Ymaa	she playing you so you  get mad and say something|`|ts43Kj6Maa	She's probably trying to flirt with you. I had this girl that was my friend forever and she started doing stupid things to piss me off and annoy me. Then her friends told me she was trying to flirt with me and now we're going out.|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	Cause she can ...kiss kiss...!|`|vMwpReSZaa	she just wants the attention from you. That's all. Show her more attention. And If u already do do something nice for her.|`|AA11214195	She doesnt want to be with you anymore. She's starting things so you would break up with her|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	it;s a conspiracy,|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	because shes an ***, talk to her before dumping her, if it gets out of control or she doesn't seek to hear about your feelings then END IT.|`|22361ccf499011b738729419c55cc7fdaa	It's 2009. It's her job.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Sometimes that is just the way it is. What it says to me is you are not compatible, move on for your own sake.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	To piss you off on purpose? Maybe she likes the drama? Or perhaps she wants to know the answer?|`|qgUHLb6raa	She thinks its funny but when you do something like that youll understand that is also is so dont get that mad its just playful|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	She's female & immature|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	I think she doesn't love you. After all True love only focuses on what's important on making you happy. So you should be strong and tell her what's up.|`|ihfsrPlkaa	Better for you to be pissed than her.|`|YN1lQLZWaa	Cuz she doesn't want to be with you no more!|`|e158WyFGaa	Girls are like that  they need to piss off someone all the time|`|UmDqxnr6aa	she doesn't care about you.  find someone better.|`|Lyq4TlDfaa	i agree with TJ|`|D518ejJDaa	B/c she doesn't like you or she is just being a brat trying to make you pissed... -.-|`|tUbvWoCqaa	My ex (KEYWORD: ex!!) used to do the same thing. She'd tell me about guys coming up to her and slapping her *** (And her liking it).. retarded stuff that could only get me mad. I ended up saying how I didn't give a ****, and she EXPLODED saying I don't care about her. If your girlfriend is anything like my ex, she's just doing it to see how much you care about her. It sounds sweet, but trust me.. if she's like my ex it gets worse and worse.|`|RJHaUs9Paa	To get a rise out of you, theres something wrong in that, knowing a weakness of someone you love and hurting you whenever they're in a bad mood, i know how you feel...either be the bigger person and talk to her about it or just tell her staright out,"look, you think you can treat me like this, you're crazy, cause i know what can hurt you too and i can hit back(with words)" lol not with violence...if you love her, totally let her know and if she doesnt cut that stuff out, idk....hope i helped  |`|pUulqtLGaa	cuz she likes teasing u around    dude don't let her get to you    if u don't like it just let it her goo    you'll find some1 who really loves u trust me    let her go|`|7nGwou8uaa	shes a ***** and doesnt care|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Because you two were not ready for a relationship to begin with.      At least one that was somewhat serious in which you two actually respected each other.|`|T1f3Dcc3aa	most likely.|`|OI7eeIreaa	Didn't you ever catch ants in a jar and shake 'em up?  Same thing.|`|o2dnH9WAaa	people who do that need to know that it's not right. if it pisses you off, dump her sorry a$$.|`|ZvV3cPPFaa	because she is either messing with you to play hard to get or shes just an asshole|`|82re5XqZaa	I have seen and heard of girls like this before. Girls like this are insecure and are looking for ways for you to show that you appreciate her. One way of doing that is to test your buttons to see you reaction to see if you care.|`|wB8bK0vFaa	Because people like drama, whether they admit it or not. If she didn't do those things, you'd probably have a very stable relationship. Stable relationships can get boring, so she does things to piss you off to add something "exciting" into her life.|`|cxXDXUY0aa	she prolly doesnt like you anymore and feells bad cause prolly you like her alot|`|T5AgMznKaa	she does that to get your attention  girls love doing that to guys..  i have no idea why though      tell her it bothers you and see what her reaction is  if she dont care about how you feel and doesnt say sorry about it or feel bad for doing it then i suggest you dump her  you cant put up with that if she dont care|`|aXHBjVwDaa	I can only say this as a maybe but I believe that she's receiving some signs from you that hint to her that you aren't as interested or enthusiastic about being around her, so maybe she is using tactics such as angering you to gauge some sort of reaction even if it's bad. Try paying some attention to her or you could ask her straight out to see if my theory is right or not. I hope answer helps your relationship.|`|3ctchU2faa	Maybe because she wants you to open up to her why the things she does upset you so much.|`|FW0QP2RMaa	Sometimes it is fun to "play" or "screw" with your lovers. Try doing it back, it could either end very good or bad. But don't do anything too big the first time. Just something small. Some people enjoy fighting and conflict in relationships. Just hold it out and let her know how you feel.|`|vK62oKJnaa	cause imma gurl and its fun lol|`|TQ8Hbiv9aa	girls are like that. am i in love???? can someone answer my question???? go to my profile
OI7eeIreaa	Jerk the wheel from the passenger seat and bail out.|`|96HWpdkFaa	buy sexy lingerie...give him back rubs, ask for back rubs..(take off your shirt when he gives it) kiss him whenever you get the chance even if it's just on the cheek or forehead. Try to bring the "steam" back into your relationship any way possible!|`|NrSs1lJgaa	if i were you i would take a short break from each other like a month or so without seeing each other at all and if you guys are really meant for each other then you will get back together and be happier than ever|`|IPb9zjL2aa	Accept that there will not always be that new love feeling, and understand and grow the deeper love.  But there are some things to do to help spice things up.  Dating again is always good.  Go out and pretend that you guys are dating again.  Play a little into the fantasy.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	why not break it off as friends instead of waiting for a fight or hard feelings|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	It wasn't love it was because you were lonely...and you know it!
pFS2LZGKaa	how about...wait for her|`|7b98229ae13a8cd3f0b0f8525bd0dea9aa	get off the keyboard and put your hands where they belong...on your woman.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	if she doesn't want to do it, don't make her do it...it's her choice...if you really liked her you wouldn't force her to anything!|`|kp0QYdb9aa	hmmh if she doesnt wanna do it ur screwed!|`|IhZSaDXDaa	Be a gentleman|`|JiUwpYSXaa	anything that's good is worth waiting for.|`|7k5xrWq3aa	Wait until she is ready. Why would anyone even ask a question like this?? How pathetic. I'm glad i'm not your girlfriend! She should break up with you and find someone worth her time!|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Well you really cant make someone want to have sex with you. But you could try taking her out on a date and maybe talk to her and see if she wants to try again.|`|P2fX9v2Faa	do the right thing. wait to get married. are you going to spend the rest of your life with her. dont you want to do it with your wife? save yourself for her|`|AA12281578	It sounds like youre a pig, and thats why she doesnt want to do it with you. Just make it romantic, nice music, candles, and be nice.   warning, this will only work IF youre not a pig.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	yeah stop being a desperado and start being james bond. What i mean is that foreplay for women starts from when she gets up and if you say or do anything that shits her during the day then no sex for you. you need to learn what women want man. Good luck|`|QSwTSniCaa	i dunno for me tho sex advice never really helped.  Just go with it.  If u like making out, make out a lot.  get totally good at it.  show her ure really good at it.  it doesnt sound like u guys need to talk about going all the way since uve already tried to once.  but maybe just treat her real special and do something sweet.  she'll come around.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Nothing.  If she wants to she will if not then she won't.  I don't know what your age is but you should keep in mind that having sex with an under age minor is actually a crime called statutory rape and you could end up being labeled a sex offender and then have to register.  This could ruin your life.|`|EDg58kIJaa	Ok  you can't force her to have sex with you. I mean she may not be ready now. So don't pressure her into anything she doesn't want to do. If you care about her like I know you do you will wait as well.|`|M63ul01waa	don't pressure her and she'll be more willing|`|RarSAK4Haa	ruffies?|`|NLKVrdIKaa	This episode is par for the course, just take time and don't push her until she is ready to be 'pushed'.|`|AA10040856	Don't push.
fzIeGPZYaa	ok vasectomies are REALLY effective, getting tubes tied is an option, plus birth control, plus condoms. just go with as many of those as your paranoia requires|`|1exYa9X2aa	There are only two types of birth control that are 100% guranteed. Abstinence and abortion.|`|zNjACkxpaa	vasectomy + tubal ligation + condom = 0 babies    No one should have children they don't want and no one should give up sex because they are afraid of pregnancy    A vasectomy is very close to 100% effective. Don't have unprotected sex until you get rechecked by the doc|`|DlCcFu1eaa	A vasectomy is pretty much bullet proof.    What the heck is the point without sex? You might just as well hang out with the guys.|`|8tJPK69iaa	I had my tubes tied when I was 25. It's been 100% effective.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Each married couple can do whatever they want with their sex life. I can't imagine your partner would be too happy though and that might cause them to find sex elsewhere. You are right, vasectomies can reverse themselves but if birth control and condoms are used together everytime then you should be fine.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Could a married couple sleep in different beds for 6 months?  Different houses?  Hold their breath until they pass out?    Sure, but why would you?    Also, vasectomies are more effective than condoms at preventing pregnancy IF, IF, you get the post operation sperm test to see if it was effective.  If that test shows no sperm then the "failure" rate of vasectomies are much much lower than condoms.    Why don't you know this?  Obviously you haven't done the relevant research.  Maybe you should start there.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Get a vasectomy and put her on birth control.  There are no chances you will get pregnant then or get her tubes tided.  I've known people that have done this then unfortunalty they changed their minds 10 years after marriage and then wanted kids.  I would think long and hard about this one if you are young.|`|hs793CCxaa	A vasectomy AND tubes tied should do the trick!    Do you really view sex as just for procreation? Haven't you ever had fun with sex? Your suggestion of abstinence makes you sound pretty cold.    I don't want to die in a car crash, but it doesn't mean I will never go in a car!|`|1a532f0bfba06ee62d260bb48765a42faa	Vasectomy and birth control. 99%+99% is pretty good odds.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Get her tubes tied. I wouldn't want to married to you.|`|CM0C65dtaa	I myself would not want to do that.  If you have a vasectomy and you are also using other methods, you should be good to go.  Or your partner could be sterilized also, and that would pretty much solve the problem.
bXsHaSuQaa	there is nothing wrong with that. I started dating my man when i was in 12th and he was in 11th. now 7 yrs later we are married with 2 kids. it is def. fine. good luck:)|`|3F6wJrSDaa	Sweetie, you like him! And age is simply a number, it's not gonna make a difference in your life now is it? You shouldn't be ashmed...ignore the rude remarks and go for it! I went out with a guy that's 2 years younger than me, but all my friends didn't say anything...In fact they started teasing me in a cute way when they saw the sparkle in my eyes =] It made me happy to know that they respected who I liked |`|3ctchU2faa	Don't try dating that young, wait for love when you are older.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	If you really, really like someone and want to fool around, it doesn't matter how old they are.    Just have fun.|`|6816c32f67e59956fd03d07b6db7fa9caa	It's not weird. but be prepared for consist harassment at school by other students!|`|fe730f7457a84c5c53a41d445c46f630aa	if you're letting other people influence to not go out with him then you don't like him.if you like him enough then you wouldn't care what people think.besides that's one grade..be true to yourself|`|XFlEx8UGaa	If you let your life be controlled by what other people think about you, you won't go very far. Follow your heart.|`|AA12144169	No it is not weird at all. If you like him go for it. The only reason you might think its weird is because other people say it is. Don't care what other people think and you will live a happier life making your own choices. 6th and 7th grade is not a big difference at all.|`|UaAem9T1aa	yes it will be weird, don't do anything you'll regret. And i'd wait until basketball season is over to do anything.   But once you get to high school, those things aren't as controversial anymore. so, just don't get stressed about it, because you won't give a crap about it in high school.|`|nzOMAOahaa	one year isnt enough to make ne thing weird. i have gone out with girls older and younger than me never the same grade so personally i dont find it weird.|`|3DVgioS1aa	hey imma tell u right now u should go for it aite look other people will say stuff but let me tell u sumthing it doesnt matter cause hey u got the man but wheres the persons man thats makin fun of u about it huh fairytale land they proly aint got any1 they r just jealous and want u to be misrable like them so go for it its ur choice aite peace|`|I2gLBlIVaa	hell with what ppl think, they will talk anyway! you two obviously have chemistry so just go for it, go out with him! do what your heart tells you, you'll never be wrong :)|`|ZxmxjBE8aa	My friend was in that spot like 2 years ago.

Go for it.|`|i0xFsDfaaa	Its not wierd...  Im dating a 6th grader and im in 8th.|`|LUg9dgb5aa	I dont think its really a big deal. It's just a one year difference.  I mean, when i was in grade 8, i dated a grade 7 boy. He was  supposed to be in grade 8 too, but i think he either failed or  started school late? Dont really know, but yeah. A few ppl liked  to talk crap, but you know what? Who cares. It's truely no big deal.  I mean if you like him, GO FOR IT. (:   Good luck!|`|TQ8Hbiv9aa	y dont ppl answer my questions??? i need help !!!! go to my profile|`|1vCxa7pSaa	Well, **** them.  If they tease you about it, then they can get over it.  If he seems perfect for you, then go for it.|`|3dLcWuvsaa	as long as he's nice around you and not kissing on other people.|`|AA11723433	No it's definetly not weird.

IPb9zjL2aa	Sergeant you are a good man, if you can show that child unconditional love like that and him not belonging to you.   I can only hope my ex finds a man like you in her future.  Try to go for uncontested divorce and to stay on good terms with the ex so you can be in that childs life. He is lucky to have found you and she is dumb for leaving if she initiated it.   He will need you in his life because i believe its rare that the step dad will love someone elses child like this. And who knows the next go around he may get someone who doesnt care about him at all.  Do what you must to be the father to that child.  And i promise you that you will never regret it.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Just let him know if ever he needs you just to call. And he won't stay a little boy forever he'll be around you sound like a nice dad|`|NrSs1lJgaa	i would tell you wife that even though you two are splitting up that you still want to be her sons father and that you would like to legally adopt him to be your son|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Adopt him now if you haven't already.|`|1exYa9X2aa	Maybe you can get temporary custody. Whatever you do don't give up. I don't know how old he is but eventualy he will get to the age when he can make his own choices.|`|AA11603829	Try not to think of it as you are doing the mother a favor until she gets on her feet. Think of it as you are looking out for the best interest of the stepson regardless of what happens between you and the mom. If the relationship is that strong and the mom supports it then you should ask for stepparent rights when going through the divorce. This will grant you visitation with your stepson regardless.    I would watch out for her using you as a crutch for her shortcomings in taking care of her responsibilities. In other words don't let her see you as the guy she can fall back on when ever she needs something for her kid. You should be able to see pretty quickly if she will use her son to use you.|`|uNehLjVDaa	wow good to hear ur so close 2 ur step son, just let him know u r there for him no matter what...sounds like ur over your relationship with ur wife though??|`|M5XE0ycCaa	I would sure love to know the age of your stepson but I guess that doesnt really matter.    You are the picture of a great father.  Blood doesnt matter because my first child isnt mine by blood but after 22 years that hasnt made any difference at all.    I really dont know the nature of your relationship with your ex but maybe you need to sit down with her and make it super clear how you feel about the stepson.    Tell her you want to be a part of his life and how it will be good for him.  If she is any kind of a mother she will want whats best for him and not her.    I resally hope everything works out for you.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I think you should keep him if you love him that much, but make sure it is legal and you have it filed with your divorce, then she can't rip him away from you when she does get her life together, if she does. She could just leave him there for years( has happened to other people) and then take him. You don't say how old this child is, and if he has an opinion about where he wants to be. Maybe he should know what is going on.

So, go for the extraordinary guys that you think only exist in movies.  You can meet them in hospitals, universities, laboratories, on the sets of movies, and in space.  You know what that means?  You have to be extraordinary to get those guys...|`|d91b212d386edf14327203ad487da14caa	IF YOU ARE IN SCHOOL OR AT THE MALL LOOK AT THESE  PERSON WITH A SMILE STOLEN LOOK WITH SWEET JERKY  EYE LOOK & SMILE COUPLE TIMES WITH HER/HIM EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT HER WHEN HE/SHE LOOKING AT YOU IF YOU SEE INTEREST ANS.

OHEqbfptaa	There is definitely going to be a misalignment somewhere in your cultural backgrounds in the future.  If you notice that her demeanor changes over time you will have to know  how to talk to her to get her to open up.  And you will have to study up on how you are supposed to react according to her cultural background.  I think men and women are very similar all over the world and I think  it's more about the quality time than where you live.  Hope this helps somehow.|`|pMsMx817aa	you HOPE she likes country music and rodeos?  boy... you should atleast KNOW what her likes and dislikes are before you marry her :S    ella|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Learn how to cook pad thai!|`|6b04475dfa48c895cab35ba0be43f6a1aa	she will like whatever you tell her to as long as your money lasts, seriously I bet one of her first questions were what your job was then asked if you make loads of money and would you send money to her parents, I really am wishing you lots of luck and happiness though, just be really careful
cjTsXS8raa	LEtting the guy have it is not the way to go forward, you need to work on your relationship with your husband, this in turn will help to remove thoughts of this other man.    Bear in mind that you may be reading more into his interest than there really is.    Don't ruin your job prospects.|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	Pray to God to give you strength to take away those feelings and thoughts because you want to stay pure to your marriage.  I believe the woman has the upper hand in breaking an affair of infatuation that could become an affair.  Don't do it!  Reach out to your husband, and renew your affair with your husband.    GOD BLESS!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	a crush on someone else just means you aren't dead.    what is wrong is when you act on the crush.    instead take those warm feelings and redirect them to your husband and heat up your relationship again.|`|QwLVWYkeaa	the only way to remedy this situation is to take that man to the back storage closet and let him have it.  get it out of your system
2rsiKfj7aa	It is okay to be with someone some of the time, but all of the time? Come on! Be grateful that he likes to help his parents out, after all they are his parents! They used to help him out!|`|ucsYXXdSaa	I would have expected that he would have wanted to spend the whole time with me?    dont you think thats, er, slightly selfish?    relationships 101 - couples who live in each others pockets dont last long.  everyone needs a life away from their partner|`|3ZnM8YXgaa	I can not see you in a long term relationship with this guy, yes, you said it, you are being selfish, he no doubt  has other commitments, and you are going to lose him through suffocating him.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	You can't expect him to spend every bit of free time he has with you.  He has other things and people that are involved in his life.  You need to give him some space or you will end up pushing him away.|`|X5zBqy9Qaa	5 out of 7 days are not bad considering he doesn't live with you. Its not being selfish but you might need to be talking to him about what you expected. Men are not known for understanding women and knowing what they are thinking.    If you are freely talking about marriage and living together you should start talking about the little things that will quickly turn into bigger things.|`|ezPiUYWnaa	sometimes relationships come along that are overwhelming & magical. . . . . then some immature selfish idiot like you destroys them|`|R00ad4yBaa	stalker!!!!!   run,run,run!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11596133	THAT IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.  Everyone needs space and time alone once in awhile.  You are WAY to immature and needy to be doing this and you will end up getting very hurt.
rlUUaSgqaa	I read the first chapter or two of that book, and while I agreed with much of it, there was stuff I disagreed with.  This was one of them.  I HAVE known relationships where the girls made the first move and asked for the guy's number, and then later on after they got involved the guy ended up being completely devoted to the girl.  I'm just thinking those women would have missed out on those relationships if they'd read that book and followed those rules.  I agree that the guy should be willing to do some of the work as well, but that doesn't mean the girl can't do ANY of it.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	interesting.  i asked for a man's number after talking to him for a year and he finally gave me his number but then told me that he's moving soon.  yeah, i guess youre right....he was just not that into me!! haha|`|AA11100518	depends on the situation-there is no hard and fast rule, just get the concept of what not that into you is saying.  i ask men for their numbers all the time.  not to date because i'm taken but because i need to call them back for some reason.  i would do this even if i were single. the book you read is specifically designed for women who scare men off by chasing them too much.  i don't have that problem.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Okay that book was written by a guy who is a relationship expert. So yeah I'd say thats pretty right. If he doesnt like you enough to ask for your number then you should just forget him anyway.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	I absolutely disagree with this, because it is generalist and unfair to the individual. I have never been hit on, and I've been single for 5 years. I would LOVE for a woman to be interested enough in me to ask me for my number.|`|NRldAzrpaa	I totally agree.|`|Rb087BsAaa	Yes, because women are lazy, attention getters and guys have to do all the work.  Dumb.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Actually I do.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	I thort it was a film :S    Well it depends of the situation intierly.  Itsonly swapping numbers at the end of the day. Not really skanky tbh  :)|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	yes, its the desperate or skanks that ask for the number because there are cheap like that.
2DsbMdy8aa	yes but i believe that i'm too old
wGw834Gkaa	Wow, are you lucky.  Sucks to be the woman he married!  Just think, she gets to be the one he cheats on now!  Keep in mind all the mean, awful things he did to you.  After a while you will understand just how lucky you are to be away from him.  Life will pay him back, I've always found if I stay out of it the bad guys get their comeuppance.  Then I giggle.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	First you need to remember that the way he was with you is is exactly with her and the cheating that you think he did with you he is doing with her. So believe me you got the better part by getting out of it. I went through what you did and i sometimes look back just to make me stronger and know this is not what I want and it makes me a better person. Believe me just keep moving forward and remember he was not your prize. Concentrate on your new guy the lord brought him back to you for a reason.  Good Luck.|`|N4BHooTBaa	Sounds like you never got over him, you will drive yourself crazy trying to figure this out. The woman he married he obviously felt right about or he wouldnt have married her. After all the two of you broke up so the relationship didn't work. Be happy with you and move on if he married someone else he wasnt right for you, keep in mind you deserve someone who will love you and be there for you.|`|xzJGhhN0aa	He hurt you. You can't get over that until you confront him about it.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	focus on you new honey and let it go.|`|vO4uvoYBaa	the best way to get ova a man is to get under another man|`|0iOqIbfNaa	Moving on is hard hun, sorry to say. Try not to compare your new sweetie to the old one. It will only chase them away.  If your are not completely over this person then you probably shouldnt be in a relationship. Just take it a day at a time kay.|`|rxScdXM4aa	unfortunately you can't put a time on healing. it was obviously an emotionally traumatic experience for you. all I can say is live everyday new and fresh. smile every chance you get and laugh even more. spend time with people who love you and appreciate the small things.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	You are with someone else, and he is. What the heck are you dwelling on? Even if he did cheat, what does it matter now? My ex wife cheated on me, and I am civil with her for my daughter's sake.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	My gosh!  Put a period to this part of your life & move on...  Write him a letter explaining how you feel....  and then BURN it!|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Get over it already. He just wasn't into you like that and he choose better his life. How can you be mad about him doing whats best for him? You sound selfish which is why you lost him. I'm sure you are so far in the back of his mind. Your pity party ends today! This is M&D and you are neither.|`|Rc1351g4aa	think about what the wanke* has done to you and learn from that mistake|`|EdfheYEwaa	the truth is, you never will jus stop going back and feeling it. things like this happen to alot of people for no apparent reasons, and when it happens to us, we are always left standing wondering why.   I had a very similar experience happen to me in my life, and quickly found out that what started eating me away started to ruin my relationships with other people.   As long as you are happy with the person you are with now, thats really all that matters. That doesnt mean completely shutting out all the bad experiences, because they have made you grow into who  you are, but it DOES mean to just maybe keep them quiet.  Whenever you start feeling like its getting the best of you, try and focus on something else. try and do something else. think positive and try your best to put the all the why questions away, because they never help.   i strongly believe in karma, and if he really did leave you empty handed like it sounds, it will come back to bite him in the ***.   best of luck with your future|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Just get it over with!  and quit feeling sorry for yourself!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	its all apart of life, in every life there is hurt and heartache, people get caught up with wrong people. but the past needs to stay in the past, otherwise u can't move on. your going to be hurt, its a grieving process one has to go through to find the healing.just consider yourself the lucky one, that u don't have to deal with his betrayal anymore. things happen for a reason, and acceptance is the first thing. this had nothing to do with u, it was within him. just be glad u didn't end up married to him, or with children by him. think how lucky u are that its over with and someone is treating u good now. of course this man was cheating on u, disrespecting u. some people need therapy when trying to move on, i use to wonder about my ex, and was he happy with the home wrecker, and how could he have done this to me, but u can't figure it out, there is no answer, except to see this man for who he really is, and just be glad u aren't dealing with him anymore.found out my ex was not happy with the woman who broke us up, karma. its not what happened to u, its how u have chosen to deal with it. accept him for who he really is, instead of who u wanted him to be. he chose her over u, end of story.|`|V7grzObHaa	people do things for different reasons, it's call freedom to choose....what i would be more concerned with is how r u doing?  if u both broke off your engagement, i am sure that u had very valid reasons for doing so.  consider that maturity, at least u didn't say " i do" then have to really deal with being in a trying marriage.  if he got married right after breaking off your engagement, then that is a problem that his current wife will have to deal with it because it sounds a lot like a "rebound" relationship.  if i were u, i would try not worry about if he was cheating on u or if was dishonest with u.  what i would do is look at what i did or did not do to contribute to the break of your engagement.  make the necessary personal changes and continue to develop into a beautiful, intelligent, honest, loyal and loving woman!  u can't change what happened or did not happen, but, u can learn from it and change yourself to be a better woman.  the emotional healing of your heart will take some time, just know that and allow yourself to feel the different range of emotions that will come with that:  grief, anger, depression, fear, anguish.  but, then say to yourself " i am going to be just fine, this is just part of the process of healing, my heart is just healing!"  my only concern is that in order to be the best woman, girlfriend, possibly future wife for the guy that u are with now, you are going to have to let yourself heal and move on.  it is not fair to not be able to give yourself 100% to the guy that you are with now.  He DESERVES  better than that, dont you think?|`|0UpFkX5oaa	You don't stop caring about what he did, or is doing right now. the best way to do so it to simply focus on all the great things life gave you after that experience happened. Just remember: all heartbreaks just help you appreciate love and happiness just a little bit more when you have them.    Good luck! :)|`|0Id85yiYaa	he did it b/c he's a selfish @ss. he didn't care about your feelings, nor should you care about his. however, you have a heart (unlike him) and still feel the effects...it's normal. getting over someone takes time, and sometimes longer than others. just let this happen naturally. don't force it; deal with your feelings as they come. good luck|`|Q1GuJDuxaa	1.) Get over it.  2.) I was not cheating. I just wanted a family.

Tell her to stop and ask her why she is doing this. Since you're not friends anymore -fyi friends should never do that crap- try to be around her as little as possible.

Try something alpha-numeric and a little more complicated.  Like spell a word using numbers and letters.  8 is for B, 3 is like a backwards E, stuff like that.  It's harder to hack.  If that doesn't work, you need someone to clean your pc because she's installed something on there.   I wouldn't open any attachments from her if I were you they might have a virus.  Is this chick a hacker or something?  Maybe you should ask the computer people (in their category) on here in their area how to safeguard yourself better against hacking.  Good luck.  She sounds psycho.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	first explain 2 ur boyfriend and tell him about  it and hopefully he'll understand!|`|C8bherDsaa	Well you might want to actually call him instead of trying to hook up over e-mail. Your ex-friend can't hack into your phone calls lol. I would say just call him and explain to him whats happening and not to listen to anything she says if she tries starting drama or anything. Don't e-mail anymore though that's not wise since she's somehow figured out a way of hacking into your account. You won't lose him if you explain everything that's going on. Maybe talk to the girl to. You have probably been friends with her longer than you have been with your boyfriend. Maybe if she knows its upsetting you that she's doing all that stuff, she'll stop. Talk to her too and explain yourself and how you don't want to lose your boyfriend because your best friend is trying to steal him. And if she says no. Shoot her. SIKE! JUST KIDDING! lol. Just don't talk to her anymore. She isn't worth being your friend if she is going to let some guy get between you two. No offense to the boyfriend or anything. Good Luck though hope i helped?!?? :))|`|0ac58ca0197c7e667aca099936d121d3aa	Have you tried changing your e-mail account password to something more complicated. You should also consider changing your Secret Answer, since this is the most exploited weakness (remember how Sarah Palin's email account was hacked into). Your friend might know your Secret Answer and, thus is able to mess around with your email. Change both the password and the SA. And make sure your password is not your or your pet's name.   For good password suggestions check out:   http://www.pctools.com/guides/password/?...|`|zMW7JKpDaa	get a whole new e-mail address and dont give it to her!|`|xbyCtCabaa	you need to change ur email address just for the guy and only let him know what it is...
P0WGuq07aa	In my mind, it's only cheating if you act on it. There's no definite line between flirting and talking. So keep your clothes on and I think you're clear.|`|z9uCBsmxaa	yes|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Well, in my opinion, if things get physical or the flirting consists of talking sexual, then I would say so. But if it's a simple little laugh or something minor like that, I wouldn't care.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	To me it is.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	In most guys eyes they do consider it cheating . But you got the right communication with each other he knows he's the one|`|tMPv4V6Iaa	No way!  some people are just very flirtatious, and have a sexual vibe to them, and that doesnt count as cheating.   flirting is just flirting as long as it doesnt go any farther, flirting is fun, and shouldnt be couldnted as cheating, nothing is wronge with it.|`|o0GQUIXlaa	im a guy and i think to some degree it is  if your spending more time flirting with someone else more then your men then yea its gonna piss us off    even if you dont "flirt" with him, maybe you just give them tons of hugs or something  that might make a guy uncomfortable|`|mefxIQP9aa	If there's physical contact involved(i.e. touching of the crotch), then yes, it's cheating.|`|ky3vTCTmaa	God i hope more people answer cause i wondering the same thing what  i thinking though that maybe it depends on exactly how far you take your flirting|`|67qWgasgaa	to an extent it isn't but if it crosses that line, it is...then again, it depends on your age and what kind of "flirting"..|`|haN9IMbCaa	No girl.  Touch up all you want|`|MK1z64Kraa	it depends how innocent the flirting is, if it gets like physical or something yeah but other wise i don't think so|`|L3ebaF2kaa	for me..  it cannot be considered as cheating  you doesn't make any physical contact..  well  its already in ur behavior  dnt think that it s a form of cheating

cp4FmZGyaa	No...just, no.|`|AA10953937	Make him wait.  I don't know if the time apart was the reason he dumped you, but he did dump you.  What makes you think he wouldn't dump you again and again and again and again.|`|0ne87Q96aa	u deserve better! why don't u ditch him this time and teach him a lesson... he deserves it!|`|BR0hkXW4aa	Nope...    he will leave you for the next flashy girl...|`|0oMiJGBNaa	Hell No, if u werent good enough b4 why would u be now? Dont fall for that trap|`|8f3269a830e3b8642cf1c15c965ce17baa	No.  I think he's looking for a consolation prize.      Don't do it.  Tell him he'll have to live with the consequences of his choices.... and DON'T WAFFLE ON IT!|`|NVx3iRZJaa	PSHT, NO!  Look what he did to you...like the first person said...he'll leave you again for the next girl he seems to fancy.  Show him that you don't fall for that crap, and that this is a lesson for him to learn!|`|GezuOvUvaa	Don't stay with him...trust me i made a terrible mistake after this guy was with me then ditched me for another girl whom he didn't even know, but now he's the same way. I'm not sure if your guy is like that but if he left you once he'll do it again. Keep your distance. There's more wonderful fish in this sea we call Earth.|`|ARZSNf46aa	Do YOU still love him? That's the question. Also, just figure out what's in your heart. Don't just take him back because you loved him back then, you have to love him NOW. Listen to your heart.|`|j6MXP4k9aa	hmmm, i would say yes, most likely i think he does, but this is what i learned..don't listen to what the guy tells you, first see how he is to you and what he does, this way you don't make a mistake..|`|rFd5E06baa	Hmm|`|YVWTxp5yaa	like beyonce said, if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it !|`|C7u0XLqgaa	do NOT go back to him!  he sounds like a jerk.  if he really loved you he would have never left you like that..  im sorry :(  stay strong girl!   keep your head up  and don't pay attention to him  you deserve waay better  good luck =)|`|HikylB4Taa	I honestly don't think it's a good idea to go back to him, if he did it once he'll most likely do it again, but I AM a firm believer in giving only one second chance. If you do go back to him and he does it again, don't you dare go back for more.|`|e6AF82V0aa	I think he is only saying that cause he has no one else you deserve better than that|`|bIhyeMJVaa	give it another shot.  Maybe he's learned the error of his ways and he'll stay with you this time|`|AA11293627	maybe, but try not to get ur hopes to high  good luck, kiddo|`|0tU4jkS9aa	i think i'd give him one more chance, just in case he's the one. he might really mean it. but dont give him more than one more chance, or he'll make a cycle out of it. if im wrong, and he doesnt mean it, he'll repeat the ditching process. im sorry about your situation.|`|PwOgrFk9aa	Move forward in life, not backward.  If he did it once, he'll do it again.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	just go w/ ur heart... if you think he is being honest and that he truely loves you and make you happy... then give it a try... in most cases, i would say move on... but if i were in his place and my best friend asked me out, i could see myself leave someone for my bestfriend due to the fear of losing him... i hope im making sense her... ut make sure you give it a trail period b4 you say yes... like tell him that you wanna be friends for a while and then decide :) good luck|`|IlK9Plbeaa	Give him a chance..it never hurts if the connected aint then just leave him i kno it sounds mean but honestly that is wat he did 2 u|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	If I were you, I wouldn't even bother to talk to him/ seeing him/etc...He is lonely and he is just going to use you to make him feel better. I would ignore him|`|b6e665c61b4473bfb9e4335494b7b98caa	Don't be his rebound. Guys are liars. If she had not broken up with him he wouldn't see you now don't do that to yourself you deserve to be 1st place not his trash that he can always put up back( not saying you are trash ok) but he's using you if he have the opportunity again i guarantee you he will do it again and then after a break up come back to you. Don't always be there.  You loved him and he knew and he didn't take your feelings in mind.Don't give him all that power. He will hurt you again.    However if you want to give it a chance for love go for it but if he does it again leave him and DON'T give him the chance to do it again if you realize he's going in that direction dump his ***.
UXd0mYMSaa	tell him that by asking you for revealing pictures of yourself, you feel very uncomfortable talking to him. tell him you value your friendship and you like hanging with him, but that question is inappropriate and it isn't funny. if he keeps asking, just stop answering. if you ignore him he'll get the picture that it isn't funny and it's not going to happen. good for you for saying no! you're very strong :) and i would check if this guy maybe thinks of you as more than a friend; if not, he sounds like kind of a perv.|`|ky3vTCTmaa	first thing there is no way to make him stop asking, and i have no idea WHY you would want to stay with a guy that doesn't respect you. if you let a guy walk all over you like that (cause more then likely you are gonna give in b/c next he is gonna say just one and i will quit asking which he wont after just one) you are gonna end up with really miserable guys in your life|`|uEczwc5vaa	A friend that asks you for a naked pic of you? That's pretty weird.  Well, my friend had the same situation once. She asked all of us to go to him (casually) and go like     "You're a real great FRIEND of hers"  "I'm glad you're friends with her, she just loves being happy!"    And all that stuff. It actually worked, so now they're just friends.    If you don't like this, just go and say it to him outright!  "I'm just a friend and I don't wanna give you my nude picture!!!!"    It works sometimes, but I don't know....|`|AA11146445	My advice to you is that he asked for a naked picture of you  and even though you denied the offer and he keeps on insisting  then you shouldn't pursue and continue being friends; i mean  what kind of a friend would ask that and if hes not paying attention  to you denying his offer and saying NO then how would you expect  him to give good advice and actually be a "friend"    but if you still want to be his friend then you can have  a small chat with him and explain that no means no;just  try saying that your not a slut and aren't into that kind of stuff  and if he still doesn't get the hint then send him a picture of   something random to make him quit asking,like of a naked fat  woman? idk?    hope i helpeddd|`|7haoi6xHaa	Haha! take a pic of a naked barbie and send him that!  maybe he'll stop asking? if not, ignore him until he can grow up and stop thinking about only sex.|`|7k5xrWq3aa	He doesn't sound like much of a friend to me! Why would you want to be friends with such a pervert? He might turn dangerous, so i'd cut ties with him.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Tell him no and say that you're not going to tell him again so he better stop asking.|`|iehpDiZ8aa	Tell him that you aren't comfortable with that and that he is ruining your friendship by asking for one. Say that you like him as a friend and nothing else and that is the way you want it to stay|`|tMPv4V6Iaa	if he was a real friend he wouldnt be asking for them.  but if you really really really want to be friends with him, tell him noway in hell. you are not a slutt, and you respect yourself.  and nomatter what dont give him any pics.|`|4UcPvGVVaa	get really mad. maybe it'll make him intimidated  and when he stops, you can go back to normal! :p|`|s1yugILLaa	If he was a real friend he wouldn't be asking for naked pictures!|`|294kSBhyaa	why would you want to stay friends with a guy who only wants to see you naked? that's weird on your part. that means that you'll allow guys to  disrespect you and you'll just take it. you need to firmly, possibly rudely tell him no. if he still persists then stop talking to the dumbass.|`|ZQCX1O4zaa	if your under 18 its a FELONY to take naked pics of yourself or give them away its considered child porn even if u take them u consent and u give them away..
LCIcUTwNaa	He's still with his girl right??He's a pig leave him alone.|`|AA11123061	there nothing wrong being friends with him . if u dont like him back just let him know ,COMMUNICATE , i am sure he will understand .|`|t4BpFdmdaa	maybe he broke up with his gf..go out with him|`|fR2Geezcaa	If he is doing that to you while he has a girlfriend, then he would probably do it to you if you were his girlfriend! Sounds like a "player".|`|ad26630d1398cb93d795e2a001eda28aaa	dont talk to him|`|GezuOvUvaa	if you really think your falling for him go for it. Age shouldn't matter. I'm currently with a guy that is two years older than me. When your around the right person then it seems like there's no age difference. Stop ignoring him. If your interested show it! But if your 100% sure this guy is not right for you then sit him down and tell him you are not interested. Just don't send mixed signals about whether you are into him or not. Best of luck dear!|`|40HpQquSaa	okay girl first breathe!then tell him u r not interested but still try to be his friend and maybe he just wants to be friends...(with benifits)|`|n3WWujCeaa	Just don't talk to him. It sounds like he just wants some side booty.

They help you through your problems and no matter what they are they will still be your friends. Your true friends won't ever make fun of the guy you like or are dating. They are your best pals and will never leave you. I have a really good friend. Her name is Jena and she is my sister. I love you!!!!!!
rm1oLtNtaa	yes you are still a minor and this can cause tons of problems.    In my opinion , you are just asking for trouble at this point.   Later on age is no big deal  there is 10 yrs between my husband and I ... as long as you are happy so what the age is...   unless you are like 21 and he is like 70.. that is a little weird...lmao|`|PUXmTrnMaa	Yes age does matter...when you are 16!!! Other than the obvious legal and moral reasons you have to realize that you will only be a teenager once in your life. Be a teenager for gods sake. You will have the rest of your life for older men.|`|EqkFt5Kjaa	at 16, age difference does kinda matter. "liking" a guy that is 14 years older than you is a bit... odd.... i dont blame your parents.|`|TwfyliKiaa	30?!?!?!! He has no business with one as young as you! At 16, 19 is pushing the boundaries. The 30 year old is a "man" you are a child. He may seem he don't look at you that way but he is. Save him from jail and you both a world of trouble find a boy your age. If you're only worried about the law 18 ain't far away. You can ruin your life then|`|WbmqNSayaa	i think thirty years old is a bit extreme..  but as long as it feels natural then go for it..  just be cautious, because something might be wrong with a thirty-year-old that would agree to date a sixteen year old.
sFNNDqhGaa	I looked around a found a few blue and silver favors.    They include soaps, mini cakes, a cool note pad set and a few more. Maybe these will give you some ideas.  http://partygameideas.kateaspenshops.com...    Good luck   Sarah|`|HMvXkR6Faa	My fiance and I are giving out hot chocolate "cones" like this:    http://giftdistrict.stores.yahoo.net/snc...    But we aren't spending anywhere near $6 each on them!  I priced them out to order the cellophane cone bags online and all the food products from bulk barn (a bulk food store) for less than $1 each!    Our wedding a a Christmas theme and we both LOVE hot chocolate, so it really fits us.  We are going to tie the tops with dark cranberry red velvet ribbon, that will match our invitations and the sashed on the BM dresses.    When I was researching favours I found the most expensive part was the packaging.  The special dainty/pretty coloured boxes or "bridal" theme bags are so over-priced (weddings are rackets!) so just the packaging was wracking up the cost for us.  That's why we chose the cones, the bags are available at so many places and it's food packaging, not "Wedding favour bags" so the prices are actually reasonable.    I recommend checking out bulk food stores and baking/cooking supply websites for inexpensive favour wrapping alternatives.    Good Luck!|`|2GfdpBKuaa	I had these fortune cookies http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse...    in these boxes http://www.blissweddingsmarket.com/store...|`|i41tUVtIaa	I used two hershey kisses and wrapped them in the veil material stuff and tied it with a pretty ribbon. We put a small poem attached to it thanking them for attending.  It kind of looked like the old rice things they used to use.|`|7upShB9Yaa	My fiance and I are having a photo booth at our wedding. It has dual purpose. It will serve as a guest book and as wedding favors.    The way it works is when you go inside and take the 4 photos it prints out with 2 sets of 4. You tear it in half and use one set of 4 to cut up and glue to a scrapbook page. Pens and stickers and such are provided so the guests can write things for each picture or whatever they choose.    The other set of 4 pictures is for the guests to keep. At the top of each set is going to be our names and the date. At the bottom will be something along the lines of "Thank you for attending".     It's unique and not anything I've seen at any of the weddings I've attended. I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product of the guest book/scrapbook.|`|KSEtqVT3aa	Get a silver picture frame and put a picture of the two of you in it (preferably a professional shot) and then wrap it in a colour that matches your scheme.|`|0d1ab34e7d8e6be1528a2d3ee4038e39aa	My daughter got married in June and she gave out heart wine stoppers and personalized music CDs.

We're getting stubby holders with a gorgeous cartoon pick of boy and girl and statement saying we tied the knot on blah blah and each persons will have their name on it.     i've recieved a small glass tea light candle holder (the little cup ones) with my name and a ribbon on them with a little thankyou for coming not attached they were cute and added to the centrepieces at the reception once everyone lit them|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	My now husband and I went to the Dollar Tree and got several boxes of mini bubbles and initial stickers (A for Anderson) in a nice italic script. Then put a sticker on each bottle of bubbles. I found from my sister's weddings (two before me) that a lot of people don't even take the favors so we weren't about to spend a ton of money on special ordered fancy favors. Bubbles are fun and they kept the children we had at and in the wedding busy during the reception. We just placed them on the tables scattered around with coloured confetti.|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	Well we are doing boxes with hersheys kisses inside them. Our boxes are 2x2 and we are putting silk rose petals inside them (our colors ivory and wine) then finishing the boxes with a beautiful wine ribbon. For me this was the best favor. I wanted the favors to be edible and they looked absolutely beautiful.|`|AA11312653	When I got married way way back in the 1900s, The Wedding Industry had not yet invented many of the "traditions" that modern brides stress out over and spend too much on. If you can come down from the rarified atmosphere of Wedding Industy Land and look at the matter with common sense, you will recall that Salvation Army and Goodwill stores are overflowing with discarded wedding frippery. A few people may see the little goody and say "Oh, how nice!" but most are thinking "Now I'm stuck with this junk" in silence. Believe me, most people won't even notice whether or not you have favors. Ditto for programs, save the dates, response cards, and anything personalized. Sorry if this took your fun away from you, but trust me on this -- it won't be long after the wedding until you are wishing you had that $200 cash that you blew on cheap candy in fancy boxes.     Congrats and best wishes.
6yE1eDmuaa	yes i think you should qet over her because  its pointless if she didnt want you at first then  i dont think she'll want you later.(not bienq mean)  buht yeahh jz keep away from her andd you'll find  someone who will love you and care for youu (:|`|8a2XXsnzaa	just move on please! staying away from her will be easier to forget about her. Hopefully after you do not see her for a little you will actually be able to forget and forgive and maybe continue talking later on in life as friends....once u get ur own girlfriend you will fall in love with that one! Good Luck!|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Just because you cover up your feelings doesn't mean they are not there.  People fool themselves all the time thinking that true feelings will just disappear.  Love is a powerful thing and what comes from the heart will always come out.  If she don't feel the way you feel then give her the space she needs but if she is worth holding on too and you genuienly think it is true love other than liking the idea of being in love then wait for her.  Anything that is worth having is wortth fighting for.  But listen, so many people confuse a lifetime with something that is seasonal.  What I mean by that is some people come into your life for a season or a lifetime but if you confuse the two you'll end up hurt.  Also don't waste your life for someone who don't feel the same about you because you'll only be wasting precious time and missing out on your "real" true love.  Trust me, I spent 6 years loving a man that didn't feel the same about me.  I know it ain't easy but time heals all things.  Pray to God and He will give you direction.  He is the only one that truly know both of your hearts and the future.|`|Anmy2yehaa	just bcuz u cant b her bf dusnt mean u cant b friends|`|IA054Pqcaa	Dude, this isn't what you want to hear but if she says you guys will never go out there is almost no chance.|`|wo6zDTWGaa	you cant be friends. thats just the way it is. its too hard when you have feelings like that|`|GsSRoKwBaa	hey man i feel for you i really do i been there look if you really love her then dont you dare give up! you may only get one shot at happiness so keep trying dont ever let her go i promise if you do you will regret it the rest of your life tell her how you really feel and just ask her for a chance and if shes got that bf then you have two choices kick his *** and make him leave her alone but she might get mad at you for that or you can wait its your choice but the bottom line is dont ever give up|`|ZXN0Cjjbaa	Well in reading your story as you said you have a lot of love for this girl. I want to tell you this since i am a girl just because you have been friends for a long time and you fell in love with her and denied your love don't turn your back on her. Now that she has this guy you needed to be there to back her up when things start to get hard. If your the good friend you say you are then you won't give up on a friend ship even if you love her!|`|nF2ylZwcaa	win her over by showing her ur friendly side  and that ur here for her.. bf or no bf  so just be cool about it and be what she rly needs.. a friend =]|`|FtdotWgPaa	If she's telling you she doesn't like you then you need to stop, she's with somebody and for whatever reasons doesn't think its going to work with you, you need your heart, gut and mind to be in it, and after being friends with somebody so long its not likely to happen. Either the attraction is there in the first place or it isn't going to be. Either you have it in you to remain friends or you need to walk away|`|5BbxO5U9aa	DUDE what r u saying you give up cuz she has a b/f like its gonna last i liked this girl and she had like 9 b/f during that time and now im going out with her dont give up thats b/s|`|m0PVHJIvaa	well i think it would be easier for you if you just cut all ties with her if you cant handle just being friends and thats it.
IqK0wcTLaa	She's probably jealous of you. If she's jealous she will try to be better and act better than you. She may also be very competitive or think very highly of herself. Just ignore her but if it gets to extreme, confront her and tell her how you feel.|`|iehpDiZ8aa	She is jealous and she wants to be like you.

IsyK8juvaa	nearly wanked  plz mine, my testicle  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|k73IxCHaaa	It is not unusual for men or women to have sexual desire for someone of the opposite sex or the same sex in certain cases, even though most women won't ever admit it. In the majority of cases it is never acted upon particularly with women, however is some cases it is.    If it is pure lust, you can easily put it out of your mind provided your mind is stronger than your Johnson (which is asking a lot of a man) as  in 80% of the cases that is just simply not true.    However if it also involves an emotional connection to the women, that's going to be a little harder to resist. If you are married you really need to think about your wife and what you would be doing to her, whether she found out or not. Then of course there is the guilt, which in itself can drive you crazy. I have co-workers  (both male and females) that have acted on their desires and others that haven't. I can't honestly say that one group is happier than the other.    The group the acted on there desires are happy that they found some excitement in there love life. The group that didn't act on their desires have no regrets and have made their sex life better at home after they talked to their spouses about their desires. I know if my wife was talking about desires for another man, I'd start giving her a lot more attention and I mean a lot.    How you handle this and how you will feel is strictly up to you, no one can tell you that. Just remember that lust is short lived, a marriage has the possibility to last forever, particularly if you have a good women.|`|lyWSufFBaa	Too long ago to remember.  I wouldn't necessarily say it was a "not allowed desire" for the simple fact I can desire to be with anyone I please....doesn't mean it's going to happen.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	I think that question is something that people would love to know the answer.  Just try not to romanticize the relationship.  Keep in real and remember the good and bad, and dont dismiss your feeling. If you ignore you feeling you do not properly grieve and you will carry the baggage forever.|`|hs793CCxaa	You're an engineer? And you don't re-read what you have written? Try re-reading it now - it doesn't make sense!|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Hmm,if its a sexual desire towards the opposite sex or not, and if i that person is over 18 years old and not blood related to you, that its OK. We cannot control who we like or dislike, sometimes you get that instant sexual vibe from some people, that`s called chemistry, but  you CAN control how you act upon it. You should avoid contact with that person, try to get your mind out of it by working on something that takes your mind away,the feeling will go away eventually, trust me. What would you do if you really love particular kind of chocolate, that is really fatning and you simply cant have it, go for some similar sweet candy that less fatning ;)
bYqWHuzyaa	Forget your husband.  Put all your love and faith into the Lord.  He is your Savior.  Your path to eternal life.  He loves you.. Not your husband.  God will always be there for you.  Just pray to him.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	What was your question?  It sounds like you're in a D/s relationship.  Once you fall in line and learn better he won't be so angry all the time... of course maybe he just likes the rush of being angry and you'll be in this situation forever.  If I were you I'd seriously think about what you want out of life and if you're willing to put up with this behavior forever.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Next time he goes off, walk out the house take your cell & dial 911, hopefully they can charge him with something & make him take an anger management course.   The longer this goes on, he will end up using you for a punching bag.  Take some affirmative action before you are hurt.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	And why are you with him again?|`|96HWpdkFaa	Maybe he's bipolar?    whatever it is I'd becarful...you don't want him to end up hurting you...if he's that violent you better watch that he never tries to touch you.    Maybe go see a therapist tell them about it...and they can give you better advice, maybe they will even want to see him.|`|lBe1dpESaa	You're on a slippery slope...     The way I see it you have two options.      1. Run!!! Run like Forrest Gump in that football game and don't look back!  I'm not kidding.      2. Try and work it out in which case you'll be miserable and more than likely get beaten or worse.  Then you'll leave any way. Either of your own will or in a casket.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Reality check - already you are buying into the crap that you can somehow act a certain way and it will change things. You are being brainwashed by his scare tactics to stay under his control. Scare tactics are breaking things, throwing things, refusing help, telling you that you shoul do things to not make him mad {your words} and teaching you to walk on eggshells because you think you can control the mood he is in.  In fact, there are no warning signs, it doesn't matter how careful you are or knowing when to back off, or working on anything, or letting him protect his ego or be right.   This man is abusive. You need to get out because it will escalate, it is escalating. Go to a shelter. It is the only place that will truly protect you andd ensure you can get back on your feet. Don't take a whole lot, just what you can sneak out without anyone asking questions or following you. No matter what, don't go back until and unless he goes to anger management and truly has changed his ways. Plan on this not happening, because he has been raised in this way and the patterns are very very deep. When you leave, then you will find out just how aggressive he is.|`|77d8d8cd21849a9ea42ffd10b55a0c29aa	um...that's never a good sign...next time it might be you who he does the violence to. u need to address this asap|`|gKVqS4Kvaa	does he drink? if hes an alcoholic tht could be effecting him A LOT|`|fzIeGPZYaa	ok maybe you are pushing things to far but he has NO right to act like that, period.|`|a4VEoKAvaa	you need to get out of the relationship because it will get worse he will start taking it out on you and then it will be harder to get out i know from experience|`|eibO5ax3aa	His behavior is abusive. The whys are his issue, not yours. You don't own his behavior, and you can't control it. You have to decide whether or not to remain in an abusive relationship. There is a likelihood that his behaviors will escalate. You need to focus on taking care of yourself.     Take care...|`|S8cU6ONnaa	There is no excuse for such behavior on his part. Even if you are  "pushing too far" he should not be breaking things. This is clearly an anger management problem. You may want to bring this up to him on a good day and maybe out in a public place such as a restaurant. In the long run this could turn into worse abuse. If you let this behavior continue you are just enabling him and you are hurting yourself.  If you are unsure how to speak to him, you might want to consider some counseling.  You need to be able to communicate in a healthier way with your husband if you want your marriage to be long and fulfilling and most of all a healthy relationship.  There is NO room for abuse in a marriage. If his behavior doesn't improve please get out.|`|M3maZgdyaa	You have married an overgrown child who throws temper tantrums.  People only do what other people allow or put up with. If you stop putting up with certain behaviors he will have no choice but to change.(start slowly 1 thing at a time) Men that act in this manner will one day abuse you. He is abusing you now. Verbally abusive and he is destructive. Is this the man you want to father your children? Do you think this behavior will be healthy for your children to see? Do you think you could put up with it if the husband and the children acted in this manner for your whole life? Think about these things.|`|AA12327015	He's very insecure in himself.  You are walking on eggshells all the time.  You're blaming yourself when it's HIS problem that he doesn't know how to behave like an adult. It sounds like he could erupt into physical violence against you at anytime, if he hasn't already.  It's NOT your fault.     That's NO way to have to live your life. Get out now while you still can.|`|41Sr1i1iaa	cvbcvb|`|0Cpqulbraa	go have an affair. hes a douchbag.|`|o96oCRWhaa	that sux|`|xaP0S6a6aa	yes|`|fnYhq9Aoaa	BAD temper. if he's ever hit you, he thinks its how to excersize control.   DONT ACT AFRAID. he knows you are scared. thats how he geta what he wants.|`|oi2dEDuRaa	This is tough..ID say use past expiernce a s a guide to his usual outbreaks and just learn as you go and have him skit down and relax and dont got eher next time...maybe keep a list?|`|tcPaHzkUaa	He is bi polar.   I am too. Anything can piss us off.So you really have to watch  your wording.Take him to the doctors.|`|1exYa9X2aa	Get out before you get hurt.|`|6VUesjxxaa	Did you know in NV throwing things IS considered domestic violence?  You can be arrested and put in jail for throwing a glass at a wall.  His destructive temper and blaming you (i.e. 'You shouldn't make me mad') are all warning signs that he may at one point hurt someone else.  If he's not open to change, you need to get OUT.     Try to speak to a counselor or someone you trust on your own to see if you can get more access to professional suggestions about the situation.  Unfortunately though, the bottom line is he won't change unless he is open to it.     You shouldn't have to change yourself or walk on eggshells to live with anyone.  Seek help or get out.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	That is DEF. a problem. I know someone who was in a similar situation. Though the same thing thought things would get better and their spouse did not want to seek any type of help. Well he didn't get better he got worse and began to hit her. You NEED  to give him the option of getting help with you or taking some time apart. This is a serious problem.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Ok, immediately I am going to say be careful.  This sounds like it could be a very dangerous situation to be in.    I believe immediately you need to get into some counseling so you have some one to talk to and help you get through this.    Ideally it would be fantastic if both of you could seek counselling however Im going to guess any suggestions like that would just set him off.    You need to take a few minutes to yourself to reflect.  We both know you didnt sign up for this when you got married.    I am very much against divorce but I am also very much agains violence in a relationship.    I suggest you get to the counselor and let them help you get a plan together and once thats done make sure you stick with it.  Relationship recue can be a very tough thing when there is only one partner cooperating.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Yep it is all you and you should lay down and let him walk all over you, and if that isn't enough I think you should go out and buy the bandages when he starts hitting you, and then you might just as well start digging your grave, because that is where it is headed.  Wake up, you are in danger and I know because I lived it.|`|5H9woJT0aa	Swettie i would leave his *** if he dont get his act together cause godforbid you guys get into a fight he might think he can slap you........GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!! oxoxoxoxoxox|`|109756733d11b28be4c1ee34aa4e9137aa	Check out www.drirene.com. It is a website dedicated to abuse issues. There is tons of info and support there.|`|OHEqbfptaa	Does he like his job? A guy has a hard time switching gears between  work and home.  I know this feeling. I used to be stressed out all day and unhappy day after day.  I think your hubby has been unhappy for a long time because it takes   a long history of disappointment and stress to develop an oversensitive  way of reacting.  Maybe it started when he was young and got worse because it never got corrected.  If you would like to see him happy and be happy yourself, You need to work with him on it and brainstorm a way to do it together.  Life is hard and disappointing and it's not easy to come up with solutions, but it is still easier when you're a team attacking problems.  I think he just has to be right all the time because he was or is not allowed to be right anywhere else.|`|kBA3fIYIaa	so his aggression and behavior is worse then it use to be?    I dont think this is a problem that can be fixed unless he WANTS help - whether that be counceling or maybe even meds for mood swings.    When you see that he is in a mellow mood, try to talk to him about it, tell him it scares you and that he needs self control, even if you do annoy him, he doesnt get a free pass to blow up and throw a tantrum.    if he just doesnt get it, then give him space and leave- maybe once he appreciates you then he can see the error of his ways.|`|jPoSQ3Kzaa	You need to leave him. That is most definately emotional abuse because he has you walking on eggshells and on guard all of the time because you don't know how he is going to be. That is no way to live. You should not "deal" with it. I grew up in a household with a crazy father who was just an angry man. He took it all out on my mother with his yelling and verbal abuse. My mother is still dumb enough to stay in the "marriage" because he has beaten her down enough that she thinks she "needs" him. I am now 41 and have been telling her to leave him since I was 14 because he was so angry at everyone in his world. Now she has turned emotionally abusive towards my brother and I and there is no hope for her to lead a calm and non-chaotic anymore. She is in too deep. I suggest you read the book "Verbal/Emotional Abuse, the Survivors Speak Out". It may give you the strength to get out if you see it in print. I wish you the best.
0oNHWmCyaa	um yea like I have about 4 bestfriends and all of them is annoying in there own ways and most of my friends we was enemies to begin with
4UcPvGVVaa	idk, i'd touch everything just to piss my mom off hahah  but its just a cold, you'll get better right? maybe drink some tea, listen to music, and just chill in your room or something. and if your mom starts yelling at you, just let her keep yelling until she's done. usually if i start talking back, it'll get my mom yelling even more so i just nod my head and let her do whatever she wants :p     sorry if i didn't help!

aaa3523f0b9d11f8a74170b04af40919aa	Now why do you have to be in a pound? where you wait quietly to be chosen. Life is not like that you see someone that you are interested in go after them. Approach that person talk to her and see if you have anything in common and go from there. You are only 15 with age you will get more confidence to go after who you want.|`|TQ8Hbiv9aa	just know that ur not the only one, it happens to millions of ppl everyday. but u cant wait for a girl to like u....u gotta find a girl that u like and try to get with her...meaning become friends with her, hang out with her....and then let her know that ur interested. even if a girl doesnt like u, when she knows u like her she'll think about u and will end up liking u if ur persistent|`|ZurXsQq4aa	Nothing is wrong with you.  You are that rarest of mortal beings - somebody interesting!    You will definitely find love, but it will take a while.  If you don't follow the crowd, love can be harder to find, but all the more precious when it is.    You obviously have a talent for music and artistic expression - you express your feelings very well.  Why don't you try writing some songs?  (If you haven't already, of course!)  Who knows where it may lead!|`|zIoWCX7vaa	long black hair,,    cut it! it will work    trust me|`|CdTe8MO4aa	your only 15 your going to find lots of girls that are going to date you  stop being so shy and speak up   there are probably girls that like you right now but are too shy to say anything|`|ARZSNf46aa	I say, cut your hair and that's pretty much it. Well, skinny jeans do NOT equal sexiness. Sometimes they mean weird person trying to look sexy, but its not working. But you seem like a great guy, so keep it up! (By the way, if you have a crush on a girl, you should ask her out, not the other way around.) Hope this helps!|`|qsgiZtwWaa	Dont worry, everyone has been there.  and yours isnt very long, mine was like a page.. sooo.  Just wait around and love will come for you. dont just take the first chance you get, that would be really mean.  Fate will turn out, and it wont be long, just hang in there.  nothing is wrong with you and youll find a girl that loves you and all your instruments.|`|KOSkXrB4aa	dude i may not be a girl, but you gotta relax and not focus so much on getting girls. you seem to have lots of talent and there are tons of girls out there who are interested in that type of stuff. (my gf is, but then again, she's mine) don't change yourself for them. they have to like you for who you are. besides, you're only 15. live your life!|`|Jve6H4lVaa	Well i think you're an awesome guy. musical, and you want to be yourself. don't follow the trends. (skinny jeans and guys makes me want to reach for a bucket and barf). but think about it- would you rather be with a girl who likes a 'new  you'- a you that you had to change to get the girl- or a girl who likes you the way you are- awesome hair and everything.     best of luck, and remember- even the dog who stays the longest in the pound gets picked one day.|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	theres really nothing wrong with you.  the only thing i could possibly think  of is that you arent maybe outgoing,  you didn't really specify in your question.  sometimes you havre to actually try  really hard to find someone, keep your  eyes open and there's gotta be someone  out there with the same interests as  you.  dont ever consider giving up your instruments  or anything that makes you you.  girls like a unique and confident personality,  trust me. good luck!!|`|HikylB4Taa	Well sweetie no matter what anybody else says don't change yourself for anybody! You are only 15 don't ask for trouble cause that is all a girl your age is...love is for later on in life, but a few gf's are possible you just have to find one with the same interests and tastes as you. Good luck!|`|CUC1cRjSaa	Don't change yourself for a girl you will not be happy that way just be you and one day you'll find her and she'll like you not because your like them but because your the only you!!! who wants a guy that's like all the others?|`|YVWTxp5yaa	cut your hair. and mabyebe a new wardrobe ?|`|lZVkc2hQaa	well just remember be yourself and theres somebody for everybody so if you dont look to hard she will find you :)|`|bBqbkUkmaa	its the long black hair.

I PROMIES.    good luck |`|93821bdb5da3d5a2f104f4b3594f9053aa	you cant find a girl with all the same interest if you drop them yourself for any girl. keep it up and theyll come to you.|`|kOlbN69Caa	Don't change your hair! I like long hair on guys ;)    Don't change who you are.    You'll find love one day, don't worry.    I feel the same way and I'm almost 20, wouldn't you rather find someone you really like than just someone to pass the time with for the sake of being with someone?    Hang in there!|`|p6zyQoqOaa	well hey, i think you sound cute.  post a picture! maybe im the one. :)|`|DAY6wuzTaa	Don't change yourself for anyone. Girls will like you for who you are and not who you try to be. There is someone out there for everyone so be patient.|`|LTDpbTGXaa	i know that you might not be in to it but cut your hair and change your wardrobe... look at pics of the celebs that all the teenage girls go crazy over and get there clothe or haircuts.  no offence but girls dont like weird/ diff. guys, so thats why i suggest the above.  GOOD LUCK :)|`|dhJZ6LR0aa	if you live in the bay area i know a girl who can help you, but seriously man. you have a great tallent, not many people are good at music. as for finding a girl, screw it, most poeples misary comes from bad relationships. If you really want a gf then try giving yourself a different image. im not saying to change you, but try picking different outfits/ hairstyles youy still like. just dont try too hard man, i remeber when i was 15.   be carful man, dont get your heart broken|`|N4KyJ8aVaa	honestly, don't even think of changing your self for someone to like you.     if your happy with you that's all that matters. don't trade your intstruments to find love. honestly wait. just wait. and love will find you. there's a girl out there whoose perfect for you.     im sure you'll find someone who has the same interests and likes all your instruments and music. just give it some time and eventually the perfect girl will show up. you can't find love it has to find you.     i really hope it works out for you. i always felt that i wasn't the right girl for anyone and then i met my boy friend, we've been together 11 months and i think everythings going well.    its all because i waited for the right person to come along. don't rush into things and force things along. don't try to find someone cause it could just end up in disaster and heart break. you'll find someone. they'll nprobably find you. and when you feel like someone interested in you, and your interested back.. go for it. don't just sit there and wait to see what happens.    you have to be a go getter. you have to try and let her know your interested or shell never know it. if a gorl feels like your not interested in her she's not going to kee going cause shell probably think your not attracted to her.     good luck (:|`|PKV2Tm6Yaa	Okay, first off, there isn't anything wrong with you! DON'T change who you are just to get attention. That would eliminate the uniqueness that makes you you, if you get what I'm saying. It seems as if you may just need to find the right sort of girl--perhaps you aren't looking the right direction.  Everybody has different interests.. and instruments are one of the best!!!! I wish I could play guitar, but I suppose I'll stick with being the best clarinet in the state. works for me. :) I think everyone who's single probably feels that same rush of jealousy and confusion when you see people together.   I must agree with one of your points, though. Muscles are a turn on.. so maybe if you're watching tv lift some ten pounders? again, it worked for me. It only took a week or so.   A musician who listens to indies? where do you live? haha :)  Lots of girls don't listen to the usual radio stuff, you may just have to look a little harder to find the right one. Maybe offer a girl a guitar lesson or two, or make a cd for her. Even if that one girl that you were targeting doesn't take your moves any more than friendship, things get around. Trust me. :)  I hoped my rambling helped you in some way or another! Happy girl-chasing and good luck!        p.s. please, please don't resort to wearing skinny jeans. you guys have thin enough legs as it is, no need to go flaunting it!! :)|`|vaR6Poxxaa	Well here's some advice. Don't change your passions just for a girl.  There is a girls out there for you and you just need to be a little more patient. If you change your personality then you won't fell so natural with the girl. Hope that helps! : )|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	You can't find love because your 15.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	You be who you want to be, if you like long black hair, then you keep it because that's who you are.     Every girl has their own tastes and opinions. For me, guys with long hair just don't attract me (sorry), and I prefer guys with short hair. That's just me though, some girls like the long hair and hate the short hair.    It doesn't matter though, you shouldn't change yourself just for a girl; they're not worth it. Act like yourself and one day a girl will become attracted to you.     Just continue on with life and stop looking or waiting; just let things happen.|`|3ctchU2faa	You need to just wait to find a girl who appreciates your music and who you are. She's out there, just wait for her. You're only 15, just take your time :)
ZXN0Cjjbaa	Really the best thing to do is not for you to say anything but this other guy should talk to them and show them that he has grown up. You can't fight this prob for him.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	That got the right one for the job  Congrats!
domEftoIaa	my husband is the same way. i just ignore him and go on thinking he is crazy. maybe you should video tape one of his crazy moments, then maybe get him to sign up for anger management.good luck!!!

Otherwise, she might think you are jealous or lying for another reason, and it can cause problems with your friendship. You know, people DO like to shoot the messenger. Get proof or wait. She'll find out eventually. If you have proof, just straight out tell her and show her the proof.|`|7k5xrWq3aa	Tell her in her "truthbox" on her myspace.

Tell her yourself. And if you like you can tell her not to say who she heard it from when she confronts him.|`|mY1R6erBaa	well now that is a really hard one you could talk to him and see why he is doing this and everything or you could tell another person and have them tell your friend for you.|`|4ab292baf553d5f4bc2aabbdf995ce8caa	Be careful, be very careful.  Your best move is to encourage the boyfriend to be honest with her, remind him it's just not cool to treat her like that, and tell him he has three days to clean up his act or you will have to tell her.  Ask him how he would feel if someone was treating his sister the way he is treating his girlfriend.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	That's a pretty tough position to be in, but would you rather she be angry at you for telling her or end up hating you because you knew all along and didn't say a word... If she is a true friend, i think you'll find that she'll be glad that you spoke up instead of letting this jerk keep on making a fool of her..|`|V780bRMRaa	Set up something. Get him in one place with the girl he's cheating with, and "accidentally" bring her there to see it.|`|QMRq8Cneaa	The best thing you should do, is downright tell her. If she doesnt know right away, then she'll get hurt later. Its best for her to know sooner than later, or it will be worse if she catches him with another girl.|`|iU7Ak6ruaa	You should talk to her after school or a quiet place.Say this....I am not trying to be messy but i think your boyfriend is cheating on you.And if she doesnt believe you tell her you'd never hurt her in any way.|`|amePlcjMaa	send an anonymous note with proof... she'll know what's going on but won't know who tipped her off... and he'll never know as well|`|dBDxfrLFaa	idk... find prove and tell her? or tell her best friend.. nvm i really don't know  im srry|`|SNaxiArHaa	drop her some hints or send her an anonymous email (make a new email address to do it) or text (from another phone) or a note telling her that he boyfriend is cheating|`|QifDSvupaa	tell her honestly if she thinks u r lying then she is not a true friend or tellthe othere girl the guy is dating|`|KHaoj2BWaa	don't talk to your friend for a while so when her boyfriend then you say ask you
DbRmjYvvaa	I'm so sorry this happened to you!  What I would do is report her.  If you have friends in your class that would back you up on what she said you could tell the principal.  Something similar to this happened to me and I actually ended up switching classes.  Hang in there sweetie,  don't let anyone get you down.  (:|`|t4BpFdmdaa	what the hell is wrong with her. u could have talked back!!    and btw in case u haven't known..teachers earn less then garbage men!    tomoroow give her dirty looks n if she askes u...tell her she is being disrespectful and she should stop harassing you..    she may not be, but do that..DONT BE AFRAID STAND UP 4 URESELF|`|yIHlvPFfaa	report her for being racist  go see your principal and say that she was making fun of you and your family, if it happens again you should report her|`|N5nxFbB9aa	wow, if she was making fun of your family, tell your parents and have them tell the school. It's so wrong and super insulting and talk about against the rules!! It's illegal to descriminate people, and if you have your parents tell the school , they'll have her in trouble for this wrong thing she has done.   I'm so sorry about it!!  that has happened to me before but I was too afraid to tell anyone so I never did until she insulted my mom (who cant speak english either)   AGAIN im so sorry because i know how it feels.  Have them tell the school!|`|jbxUtJRDaa	tell ur parents and hav them call the school- that's racism!!  other teachers hav been fired for it.|`|P2XaznhLaa	Wow That is really fucked up,,,i would go 2 to the principal and the guidance councilor and report her,,
9dJqoV9Laa	if you're actually being abused, you definitely should say something. these people can help you, even though it's really scarey. if you're not being abused, don't worry about it. :)|`|TwfyliKiaa	They will do ANYTHING to destroy your family!  They will take anything you say and twist it into the worst possible thing. They are not your friend! That said if there is true abuse you're being hit etc...go ahead and tell them! but if there isn't watch what you say. Sorry that I may of upset you. Again if it 's true you gotta say something but if it's not watch what you say. I hope it'll all work out good for you and your family
8756d9615b671320f126588a2cd1a8a8aa	Hey Ugh... Thea theres lots of pervy pedophiles staring every where all ages. Grown men like those shown on Catch a Predator.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Us guys are just pigs sometimes|`|2ONtnHbJaa	i would say that is might be a pedophile.|`|iehpDiZ8aa	It happens acasionally but that is weird that he likes her but she might be lying about her age or something because most guys won't do that. Its not really normal and she is way too young for him and he might be doing this just for attention|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes he is sick|`|hBSh8Y1haa	If he was 30, I would say he was definitely acting inappropriately and that his behaviour was not acceptable. At 20, it is still the wrong age bracket. Six or seven years is not a big age gap but at that sensitive age I would say it was wrong and not acceptable.
rm1oLtNtaa	you will be ok when the lawyer draws up the divorce papers .. lmao|`|a4VEoKAvaa	first of all dont fight and if u r stupide enough to fight then you breath deep till u feel better|`|Tr24mmt7aa	I think you have the wrong category.....|`|PUXmTrnMaa	LOL!!! Dude, sounds like you need a new hobby. Seriously though, time is the only thing that relieves getting the wind knocked out of you. Your body could be telling you that it's not on the same page as your brain as far as fighting goes.|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	Take that boat up the river of love with your new sails Baby! ,. Float with the current till the river bens and the lake ends .  Said in time ., you'll be mine !  lol...lol...|`|7royFhIgaa	You take a deep breath.|`|AA12081690	short breaths, slowing progressing to normal breathing.  I have always done this, and my friends remind me when I can't think, because the wind is knocked out of me.|`|ZMZ2iuyyaa	Come to me and i will sort you out. we can **** like bunnies and i can stroke your clit..
JbVyFcJjaa	Sometimes friends are meant to grow apart, and its better for them.  But, if you want to be friends with her again, invite her to you house, or to the mall or something, and tell her how you feel, just casually bring it up and say something like, "so, i've noticed that we haven't really been hanging out as much lately, and i've missed you," or you can leave her a note somewhere saying that, than set aside some time each week where just you and her can hang out and do whatever you want. once you have this set time, you are gauranteed to become friends again, the key is to try, if you try, and it just isn't working, maybe you are meant to grow apart, it's not unusual for friends to grow apart, sometimes they just have different interests and don't have as many things in common as they used to. but if you really really want to, it's definititely possible to stop the growing apart.    good luck! :D  hope this helps!|`|vi13HJzGaa	this exact same thing is happing to me itss soo upseting!!! when we hang out every once in a while it feels acward like we have nothing ot talk abouttt..... it makes me soo sad... and when i go on aim I have to sit there and wonder if I should im her or nottt!!! this suckss.. i miss her soo muchh!!!! and somtimes i feel like she loves everyone except me!
bhpUw9Nxaa	i think i try too hard to flirt or be more outgoing than  i really am and maybe that distracts them from the  real me sometimes, although some guys seem to like  it. i always pay attention to every little thing that they  say and then if i ever bring it up in the future they forgot  about it and i feel like a stalker. hahaha  i smile like CRAZY too, kinda embarrassing, i smile  for absolutely no reason.|`|mxRBxYNqaa	I get very clumsy and sometimes i studder.|`|HQEMJkMGaa	I try really hard to listen.  But it just doesn't work.  I'm always a good listener.  Except when the person i like is talking.  Hahah.  I play with my hair and laugh a lot.  Like a fricken lame-oooooo.|`|cbY16vs4aa	well around people i am interested in (John) i am really sweet and ever girl goes to the big event but to show him you really care about him go to the small events example : the state game vs. the local game|`|SGjhNidDaa	me too, i listen and give feedback and laugh and act like im interested. then they're like wow, shes relaly into me.|`|AA10953937	Stare at their crotches.|`|3ctchU2faa	I laugh hysterically cause I get nervous.|`|fe730f7457a84c5c53a41d445c46f630aa	I do something to get them to notice me.and ill talk to them everyday and treat them different from everyone else|`|mFAJG2E8aa	I always play with my hair. And brush my cheek with my hand. My boyfriend thought it was so cute - I seriously cant help it, my hand is always in my face when I get nervous or excited!|`|d91b212d386edf14327203ad487da14caa	ACT WITH THE FLOW & BE ALERT WITH SMILE ONLY EVEN EVERYONE LAUGH|`|Jve6H4lVaa	first, i accidentally act like i've got lockjaw or something. i get so nervous that i can't talk. then once i get more comfortable i'm their best friend and they think that 'woah, there's someone who i can trust...'|`|mY1R6erBaa	I do the same and also im always looking over at him and talking to him as much as possible even if its just asking him a random question lol|`|sHBPfItfaa	i get kinda loud actually :P like im fighting for there attention almost,for example. if me and a friend are walking behind someone i like ill make our convo louder and more interesting. hahaha :)
bID1Pd7Gaa	He just got some pepper in his eyes.|`|QGxQrDTJaa	He just wants to see if he can still have you. He may be moved on but it makes him feel better when you flirt back because he thinks he still has control. Keep it strictly friendly, and if he can't you may just need to back off completely for a while.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	he still likes you. but you will never know for sure unless you ask him.|`|8f3269a830e3b8642cf1c15c965ce17baa	He sounds like a first class idiot.  If he has a girlfriend and is flirting with you, that means he has no respect for either one of you and fancies himself some sort of pimp daddy.      Walk, hon.  And don't look back.|`|j6MXP4k9aa	yes! most certainly..|`|ns1F0p8Laa	If he wanted to be with you then he will.  If he giving you signs that he is interested then talk to him about the situation and see what happens.|`|41Sr1i1iaa	jhk|`|o96oCRWhaa	totally|`|tcPaHzkUaa	He is a man hoe.|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	sounds like that boy is confused.  give it time.|`|8C8kaUP0aa	I wouldn't trust him!! Guys usually like keeping their options open although there's just as much of a chance that he's getting tired of his girlfriend and looking back at old times. THAT is why the best advice once you break up with someone is to cut off all ties, especially if the break-up was bad to keep the guy from trying to keep a flame alive to keep his options open!|`|6uga0JvQaa	He probably still likes you|`|TNNSHdypaa	Obviously he still likes you.     "love yah lots xoxoxo bffe" when said by a guy pretty much means he's thinking "give me another chance, give me another chance, pleaseeeee give me another chance"    lol.|`|dBDxfrLFaa	i really think he likes you and that his gf was to make you jealous.. but i can be wrong for all i know|`|8EO7DCogaa	still likes you|`|u580clpdaa	yes most defintetly most guys act this way. tell him how u feel|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	im pretty sure he still likes you. if he is even trying to make you jealous, that means that he wants you to notice.... so he still likes you either way.|`|kW4mC5yvaa	He definitely still likes you, but I wouldn't go for him if he's like that with his girlfriend now, because think of if you were in the other girls place and she was in yours.  She'd be happy, but you wouldn't.|`|ydn4ql0zaa	JUST ASK HIM!|`|8VaSOTfnaa	Maybe he just wants to know he still has you on his list.  Some guys like to feel like they can still have someone they are not with because it makes them feel better.|`|qsgiZtwWaa	yeah, i think he still likes you, but is just stringing you along.  try and talk to him and straighten it out in person or on a telephone, not texting.|`|7vfBu0x2aa	both|`|XLJvS4RTaa	Maybe hes confused weather he still likes you or not?  I guess it happens if you ever have a break-up, because you need your heart to erase the ones you loved but its hard. So maybe hes just caught in a web. Or he might still like you?  You know people, even though there in a relationship they still wanna have a little fun! :]|`|93821bdb5da3d5a2f104f4b3594f9053aa	hes trying to hurt you... revenge.. =)|`|ojwRgCLqaa	I think he still likes you. you should ask him though just to be sure. i don't think he'd do that if he didn't.     do you still like him?|`|O61k4AUmaa	sound like he likes you.. ask :)|`|c5nfNREGaa	i think he still likes you but is afraid to tell you that but he wants to stay friends|`|30Tb3xyVaa	he.... Misses u   seriously he does   like he probably has   a girlfriend to make u   jealous. I been threw   itttt, its ok boys (also "US"   girls) can be confusing   at times! :P      haha, that kinda made me   giggle  "love yah lots xoxoxo bffe"    ?He Loves U GIRLE!!|`|UKScCHWGaa	Well, My Opinion Is That He Still Likes You.  And It Seems As If He Never Wanted To Leave  You In The First Place. He Still Has Feelings;  And His Girlfriend Could Either Be Something  To Get You Jealous; OR He Could Be Using  Her To Make It Seem As If He Doesn't Like You  Anymore Because He Might Feel Embarrassed  If You Know He Still Wants To Be With You..  Ect Ect.    I Hope I Helped :D [:|`|C7u0XLqgaa	he kinda sounds like a jerk. my ex did the same to me and just kept leading me on but didn't want to be together.    find someone better than him!  i know you can!! =)  good luck
JPBh5WT3aa	Wear something that makes you look great.  Do yourself up so you look great.  When you look great, you feel great.....and you will walk with confidence.  With that confidence, you will not waste a thought on that stupid girl.  You will be too busy having fun!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Looks like she won she got to you. You should have pretended not to see it.|`|40HpQquSaa	just be with your friends and when you see her pretend like you dnt and tell your friends to keep a look out for you.like if she looks at u tell your friend to tell u so you can look the other way or start fake laughing|`|COmp4sIuaa	That happened with me. Just find some guy at the dance who will take your mind off of the other guy. If you don't react, she won't make out with this guy.|`|iehpDiZ8aa	Well you can start to like someone else, or you can find something about it that is funny, like maybe she is really gross or something, just try not to let her see you when you are in a weak position because that is what she wants and if you show her that you don't care then she will back off. You can find a guy that is way better for you and that won't do that with just any girl. You are better than he is and you deserve better, if he wants to makeout with a **** then let him. In the end you will be the one that wins the fight|`|isA4wtnMaa	You can't help how you feel, in my opinion.  You're going to act the way you're going to act.  Just remeber, neither of these people are your friends if they're trying to hurt you intentionally.  They might not even be worth your tears.|`|pVU1xx0laa	okay is there anything u know about her so u can get the first punch|`|rJ7OgRzgaa	crying is healthy- it natures way of saying don't hold it in. more importantly crying isn't your real issue - its that girl and your ex! its clear that they both don't care about you and its clear that you're wasting a lot of emotions on this guy, where in fact he doesn't deserve a second of your precious time. he even made out with another girl in front of you!!   not much of a man is he?     focus on the brighter side of life and all the opportunities that are waiting for you. ignore what has betrayed you and love those who respect you. G'luck!!
3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	You are blaming the woman for having sex when it is the man who refused to take responsibility for the consequences of sex.  She is the one assuming the daily care of the child.      Doesn't get much more twisted than that.      Granted, these women should use contraceptives.  But if they have the baby they at least take responsibility for the daily care.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I have to agree.  Sadly I think some of these gals think the mates they chose will change, which is laughable.|`|uR8LM6iKaa	hey, did she know he was gonna change?? maybe she did, than she is an idiot for thinking that "oh, ya he will change, but if i have a kid with him, it will be different!"     but if she and her spouse wanted to have children and the husband didn't do anything to raise this child than he is an *** for doing that. Leaving his wife with a baby to take care of with no help?? god what a dick!! that is not a good relationship    women are getting desperate with men now  because most men never take a relationship seriously. NOT ALL MEN so dont think i am telling off any one. Its mainly just those jerks who want nothing but sex. So by having a kid, the women will think that the man wll take their relationship more seriously. I will have to agree with everything you said. But if the women had no idea the man was going to change than she married a jerk. That will lead to fighting and maybe divorce, Not a good enviroment for a child, The child might devolp personality disorders by there parent's behavoir. The dead beat dad i think is just a man that wants sex and his wife is just a women that will give it to him. That is a very unstable relationship and will crash. The dead beat dad needs to take more responcibility. Every now and again, i will see a loving father and i comend him for not leaving his family.|`|8VaSOTfnaa	You obviously know nothing.|`|KBBonf97aa	As politically incorrect as it is to do so, I agree with you.  Women don't seem to realize they get to pick their children's fathers.  The kids are the only victims in the vast majority of cases.  If they've got idiots for fathers and mothers who think idiots are great mating material, what chance do they have?|`|vF5lU8zeaa	amen|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	different kids, different fathers, but what about the ones that did have a FAMILY and thought we would stay together but the DEAD BEAT dad decided when the oldest was 8 and the youngest was 2 that he didn't want to be a dad? He stayed around for 8 freaking yrs, then has the right to change his fricking mind and leave and not support his kids!    That's a freaking  DEAD BEAT DAD THERE and I hope the judge throws his A** in jail when we go to court on Monday|`|NoZ3NAA6aa	I was married to my kids' dad for 8 years.  Then, he decided he didn't want to be married anymore, said he wanted a divorce, and he'd made up his mind.  Five years later, after the divorce, he owes close to $10,000.  Sadly, that amount should be a lot higher, but his child support was set at a measly $74 a week for two kids.  He was unemployed when we got divorced and his child support payments were based on minimum wage since he had no current income to base support on.  What a joke.    And, the icing on the cake?  He and his present girlfriend are now pregnant.  And they got pregnant PURPOSELY.      Tell me, if you can't (or won't) support the two kids you've got, why in the heck bring another baby into the picture?    So, I would have to say, I tried to make things work with my ex.  He left.  And he's getting off scot-free because the system sucks.
hOWNwpCLaa	You had a little argument, and that's cause for divorce?  The world is so selfish these days.  How about thinking about your family's happiness instead of your own.  The world doesn't revolve around you.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	They never wanna leave a after wards, look like "the bad guy" in the situation. I hate when they play those stupid "mind games" on you. When I was married for the first time, after he said "I don't wanna leave anymore", I simply left myself. Of course, we didn't have children at the time and the apartment was "a rent" but I had no doubts, I needed to leave ! You have to evaluate very well your options and have a "cold mind" when making decisions ! Good luck !|`|s7hEvXQdaa	So you want HIM to feel like he's breaking the family apart?  Why?  So that YOU don't look bad to the world?  And how does a "little" argument turn into him moving out?  And what happiness does being a married mother prevent you from pursuing?  Do you want to date other men and not have the daily grind of caring for your children?  TOO LATE!  I suggest marriage counseling...HONEST marriage counseling where you talk about your regrets and hopes for the future so that your husband can tell how lost and lonely you've been feeling and realize that you have plans for yourself as well as the family and that you're not just some house cleaner-cook-hooker at his disposal 24/7.  But it's unfair for you to think HE wants to break up the family.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Have you tried marriage counseling? Or are you sure the spark is gone.  Remember it was a little arguement right???|`|8tJPK69iaa	Your husband is comfortable and does not want to leave his comfortable life. Yes you have a right to pursue happiness. Is it possible for you to move out?|`|AA11603829	If you are not happy then you should walk away from the life not force him out of it. I think it is really unfair for someone not to be happy anymore yet they try to take everything that the two built together. He rethought things and does not want to leave. Thats good right?|`|jPoSQ3Kzaa	It is rather unclear why you wouldnt split the house and he just pay child support if you try "dating". He has legal rights to the marital residence so why would the guy want to go live in a hotel or an apartment when the house is legally both of yours until dissolution of the marriage by the courts?  Also " a little argument" doesn't seem to warrant a divorce unless there is alot more to it. If I were him I wouldn' move out of my house either.|`|AA10248966	And you can expect him to continuously;y throw roadblocks in the attempt of you to regain tour sanity by dumping him. Go for it, Do not worry about him slandering you TO the kids. Simply go into therapy with the kids and tell them that you Love them very Mich, but dad is what is known as an abuser, and you do NOT want to be around him , and he refuses to get Professional help for his poor behavior in his head. Also, YOu Tell them that you do not want them to feel they are to blame. It is all his fault, because he is abusive, and you will not tolerate him abusing the kids either. . In addition.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	This game is getting old, stop playing it.    You BOTH are playing it.     Grow UP!|`|GbwLZ28maa	a LITTLE argument and you are leaving???
uEczwc5vaa	Yeah  It's sad, really|`|tMPv4V6Iaa	yupp.  i think everyone has.|`|haN9IMbCaa	Yes becuase that is life
DcVoq5Tuaa	so they want you to skip your senior year and go to college with other kids that are 2-3 yrs older than you and run the risk of you "letting loose" before your ready to?    I can't see any benefit from skipping your senior year when there is so much involved that you would miss out on . heading away to school with other people who areolder than you just doesn't seem right. You need to stay where you are and enjoy that last year of high school. You learn many life lesson's while being there.    College will still be waiting for you when you are done, you might even decide to attend another college than the one they want you to attend. It's your education and should be your decision. If they say they won't pay it you don't go now, take out student loans and pay for yourself.|`|770efca59cf67529e64dc600da7f00feaa	Take the leap and go to college; you'll never be sorry. Visit the campus if possible so you'll know as much as you can about where you're going to live, what kinds of activities you want to be involved in, and the types of courses you want to take. Best of luck!|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Talk to them and tell them that you feel you are not ready yet, and promise them to go to college next year.    Tell them you feel like your time has not come yet.    I am sure they understand if you talk to them and explain your reasons.|`|w6xxEZMYaa	Go to collage noob.  WTF do u like about high school.  ANyway are you 18.  if u are not then they can control your life.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Their plan is more beneficial to adulthood.  You are apprehensive about maturing too quickly.  You have the rest of your life (after College) to be carefree so why defer in high school.  You anxiety is you questioning you own maturity.  No one can answer that for you but the sooner you get started on college, the sooner you will finish.  The desire to stay in high school is no challenge for you.  Don't play wimp.  Live courageously.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you're going to college on their dime then you've got 4 more years of carefree time before you become an adult.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	College requires high school graduation / GED. i'm in college & these r  their rules.
XoE8UO85aa	talking to guys through text is horrible. you're never clearly able to read his emotions or if you were in my case you can't get an idea of what he would be like in person. but i guess you see him everyday so that doesn't really apply lol.  a lot of guys like to flirt whether they like you or not so it's hard to say. i would try to engage in more conversation with him at school in person or something outside of texting, because talking is more spontaneous and present while texting, people either get lazy and fail to sound interesting or think too much about what they're going to say (that's what i do!). Pay attention to his body language when you're around him too. You might be able to get more hints that way.|`|4u7gxVNZaa	well i went through the same thing but in my sistuation the guy liked me as a friend! and a friend only and well you need to investagation ask how dose he like and he should tell you!|`|AA11214195	A kind of slick way to see if he does is to text him "What did you think about me when we first started talking?"|`|fe730f7457a84c5c53a41d445c46f630aa	switch it up and talk to him on the phone because its easier to read emotion through the phone.people are as bold as they want to be through a text
bEahxLcFaa	he's a jerk if he's asking you to breakup with your best friend for him... tell him no and if he never talks to her again and shes sad then tell her that shes better off without him... she doesnt deserve him if he would do that to her... good luck, tell your friend to be happy she deserves a good life ?|`|m0PVHJIvaa	dont do it. If he dont ever talk to her again then you're doing her a favor cause he sounds like a jerk|`|ky3vTCTmaa	HaHa! yeah i got some advice! tell your bff what the heck is up with this guy and then have her break up with him only dont let her take him back what a jerk he sounds like|`|amePlcjMaa	tell her the situation... if she has respect for herself she won't want to talk to him after   you never know though|`|v0910pxsaa	Don't break them up!!! Your friend will probably end up hating both of you. Just tell her that he's been talking to you, give her some heads up, and hope it all works out! Good Luck|`|RM9NYle5aa	Wow. He sounds like a jerk. Don't do it, because obviously this guy isn't right for your friend... or anyone as a matter of fact.  He needs to get his head straight and stop acting on his hormones.

If you can't, then you're just going through a phase.  Don't worry.|`|TkPFp8vqaa	Your question is confusing because you are the only one who can tell whether you love him or not. My experience tells me that when I feel depressed the first person that I think of to calm this sadness or depressing feelings is the person that I love, unless this person has to do with the sad feelings. Im not sure why you are not liking him at this point but it is really not a good sign. Good luck..and I hope you feel better soon.|`|F15Kfifzaa	i had the exact same feeling   its really horrible feeling like that  so i let my boyfriend know i was feeling down and stuff and he started showing me extra love and that's when i realized that i did actually really love him and it was just me feeling low and depressed. get him to show u more love and go out and spend more time with him if it seems the same and there is no feeling there than maybe you are falling out of love with him x|`|AnRxCLZXaa	you could be falling out of love with him, but i don't think so. at least i hope not. i have the same problem right now with my boyfriend T-T|`|VFPz1pDDaa	you have to ask yourself that. i just got out of a 3 year relationship and it sucks. but just ask yourself if you still like him and could see yourself with him for a long time.|`|LQ7uCndIaa	this is exactly what happened to my ex boyfriend and he broke up with me.  after wards he realized it was the right thing to do but of course devastated me.  maybe its the best though ...
2Cvdu454aa	your first love is the hardest to get over. trust me. i know. me and my ex broke up two years ago and im still not over him. there is no easy fix and no one can replace him  even though you can see your ex's faults you still think about the good times you had, etc  if you make a move with this guy, you could be together for a while but you will never feel the same way as you did with your ex. which will inevitably lead to the two of you breaking up  its a sad thought but your not going to get over it quick  if your really serious about it though, give it a shot  who knows. this could jsut work out well for you and you could be really happy  but remember  1) no one can be replaced  2) dont mistake this guys friendliness for something else    keep hanging out with this guy. you could realise that you dont want him as a bf but as a good friend :)  that happens to me a lot haha    oh and btw, the whole "saying your ex's name" thing, dont worry about it. its normal. the feelings your projecting to this new guy are the ones you projected to your ex, so your used to saying things like "i love you jake" when your actually talking to sam ;)  xo|`|KD6C54s3aa	Okay, I'm going through the same thing. My ex and I broke up because since it was a long distance relationship, he wanted someone closer. :( I still try to talk to him because I love him. However, I am really in love with my new boyfriend. He hasn't yet taken his place since we just started dating a few days ago, however he is really great and even more caring. But I am realizing that as time goes on, i'm getting over my ex now. :) So I would suggest you keep hanging out with the new guy, and see what happens.|`|vXR5L8Jfaa	You're not over your ex yet. I wouldn't really look to get into some kind of relationship with this guy other than a friendship because you might, without meaning to, treat him as a rebound, and he might do the same thing to you because he just got out of a relationship, and it'll just hurt the both of you even more. Just give yourself a lot of time to make sure you're completely over your first love. Good luck!|`|62xJhGxraa	well there is nothing wrong with hanging out with him it might help feel that empty spot i so know how you feel, after my first love which well  we broke up in around october too well i was so deppressed for months! i didnt think i would ever get over him but i did or well you know like last night i had a dream that he was so sweet and he said sorry and all that so it kinda make me depressed and stuff so anyways i have got carried away lol but yeah i dont think youshould stop hanging out with him
5YdfUiEtaa	Definitely speak to him in person.  Your trust in him should never be questioned, so the fact he is giving you doubts just speaks for itself, even if he isn't cheating on you.    If I were you, and what I have done in the past, is straight up tell him that you don't think things are working. Tell him your reasons, that you don't trust him, and don't appreciate things been hidden from you.    It sounds like you have already made up your mind that you don't want to be with him anymore, so if he cries or begs for you back, don't be sucked in, because it will all just eventually happen again. People don't change.    Good luck! Be strong :)|`|zaSyEcnqaa	what is a "sort of fiance"?     If he is cheating , break up. It will be hard, but if he is disrespecting the relationship now, he will continue to do so.   If my fiance cheated, I would leave immediately.   I cannot even imagine breaking that trust.   That is no way to start a life together.|`|RDWVoc9Naa	wow thats a hard one,     trust is a massive thing in a relationship    i think you will just have to tell him bluntly to his face 'you dont trust him'    do you love this guy??? what if he says he is trustworthy and he will change his way?? will you stay with him then???    or has the love gone ??|`|w1necKzYaa	Don't do it over the phone! Sit him down and tell him that you need to talk and tell him that you cannot trust him and cannot be With someone that you cannot trust!   Best of Luck|`|HQsmRzPsaa	talk to him about it. and if you really don't feel like you can trust him, how can you marry him and be with him for the rest of your life? if you have a gut feeling about this, maybe you are right|`|YsVAOOkOaa	hi, you should defiantly go see him to talk about it. if you are a jealous person then you wont ever be able to hide these feels, but as ive Always thought there is no smoke without fire. so it is best to confront him and tell him how you feel as not talking about it will eat you up inside. plus if you cant trust him you shouldn't marry him.
bmoCpcdraa	move on be to busy all the time|`|2ONtnHbJaa	when you talk to him ask him were do we stand. when ever he answers you back say why have you been telling people that i am annoying and stuff? just tell him how you honestly feel and if he doesn't say the same thing back to you or want to be with again then tell him you dont know what your missing.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	I would just blow him off... If he is that childish just to say crap behind your back and not even return a text...    Move on.. more fish in the sea !|`|iehpDiZ8aa	Tell him hi and then stick up for yourself and tell him what his flaws are because you can't be that annoying and if he doesn't like who you are then that is his problem cause he is the one that is missing out.|`|isA4wtnMaa	He has expressed that he thinks you're annoying so play it cool for a while.  Don't bug him and don't give him any reason to think you're constantly pestering him.  After a few days or a week, start off with saying hi.  Just "hi".  After a few more days of saying hi, ask him how he is what he's up to.  Let him say whatever he has to say.  Say that's nice, etc.  Don't say anything about yourself unless he asks you first.  This way he knows that you care about what he has to say more than you care about yourself.  This makes someone feel a little special.  It gets you on their good side.  After a while, probably two weeks total, You can have some back and forth conversation.  It is really important to be non-threatening and easy going.  Watch out for negative body language both for yourself and him.  If he shows some, ease up a bit and avoid making your own threatening or uncomfortable gestures which would in turn make him feel uncomfortable.  Good luck, I'm sure you'll be able to get over this hump.  Bottom, just start talking to your friend again, but keep it gradual.|`|fR2Geezcaa	If you can work out your differences and think of him as a friend then try to work it out. If it wasn't over anything specific then next time he walks by, just say "hello" and see what his response is. If he ignores you, you have your answer. If he says "hi" back then next time  just talk to him as if everything was normal and fine.     Don't make a big deal of it, if you have or do this might be why he made the comment of you being "annoying". Guy's don't like drama and they usually try to avoid it.|`|BIMq1zPYaa	Try just saying hi next time you see him. What's the worst that can happen? He won't say anything back? Not the end of the world. If things run smoothly from there, you can start off with small talk and try to work it out. Good Luck!|`|esTdvvpcaa	If he says you're annoying, he probably trying to save face to his friends. Is he still talking about you after 3 weeks of talkiing? That means that you're worth his time, even if it is bad. Most people don't waste that much time and effort talking about someone they dont care about good or bad. Just text non chalantly acting as if nothing ever happened dont let him know youre bothered by any of it.

Girls always have different taste to. Here are some reasons why she doesnt want one:     1) Maybe she is afraid of touchy boys     2) She might have had a bad memory or experience when she was younger     3) Maybe she doesnt want a broken heart     4) Maybe she just doesnt like anyone in your school...      5) Maybe she is looking for that 'perfect' someone when she is older.

90b9927d2e22aa09bd439680609d4015aa	A scrapbook is always a cute idea, but if your anniversary is in a few weeks, you probably don't have the time to make one. :(    You could also make a 'Love Map'.  Draw out a map of where you live and mark all the places where special things have happened between you two.  For example, you can mark down where your first date was, your first kiss, your favorite romantic spot, where he (or you) first said "I love you" to the other, etc.    Since you probably wouldn't have time to make a scrapbook, you could make a collage instead.  Get a big piece of cardboard or thick paper and collect special things such as love notes, pictures of you two, ticket stubs from concerts or movies, flowers that he gave you (dried of course), etc.  Then fill in around these things with special messages, love quotes, song lyrics, drawings, and romantic pictures from magazines or from online.|`|vJkEF1kPaa	not to sure about boy friend but for the future here what to get for wedding anniversary.   http://www.doubletakephotography.com/ann...

If you are young, how do you know that the other person has a rumor> You can't go by what the think all the time. Older people like to be teachers and usually control the thoughts of the young and it is easier to tell them stories especiallky if they wan't a relationship, sex, or just for that younger one to be dependant on them. There is more experience with them and they know you may not have as much. You need to not get involved in something which is evident a problem...When you are young especially today, you need to find the best of what is available even if it goes against the feelings of the heart. The heart is week and does not always apply to who will be good for us....Seperate the heart from the mind. Use the mind and then bring in the heart but not if the heart is leading you into a unhappy place where you have to settle and lower your standards for another who has problems in life and capablilites to bring you emotionally or your goals in life down.

If practically everyone is saying the same thing, he probably will, and should, take it into consideration.  But if there's mixed stories from everyone, he should come to you to get everything straightened out.    And if he's going to lose feelings for you over things that someone else says without hearing your side, he's not worth it!|`|BqGqfwa4aa	well how young are u? i dun think likes someone is illegal.......  except u are talking about having some 'intimacy'    Do ur status make u really scare of scandals and gossips??

Ahora que cmo lo olvidas? jajajaja.... no eso es imposible, pero aprendes a vivir con eso... disfruta lso bellos recuerdos que tengas pero solo hasta ahi dejandolo en recuerdos...    piensa que algo mejor llegar|`|hy0LCqMsaa	Hola, encuentro varias incongruencias en lo que comentas y creo que en lo que tu escribes esta la solucin si es que no hay ms informacin que agregar..    Disclpame que sea directo, a lo mejor no es lindo, pero estoy tomando como base el ttulo que pusiste.. ?como olvido? en eso me voy a concentrar...    1.- Mencionas como olvidar.  2.- Mencionas que an lo amas.  3.- Mencionas "se que l siente cosas por m"  4.- Termino hace 2 a?os y meses.  5.- Se que me quiere por que lo siento.  6.- Lo se porque me lo ha dicho mucha gente..    Van mis respuestas:    1.- Para olvidar: para olvidar necesitas dejar atras el pasado, hechar en un bal y cerrarlo con llave y no volverlo a abrir.. pero tu no has querido dar ese paso, quieres seguirlo reviviendo e idealizando cada da ms como lo ms hermoso de tu vida, porque amaste, entiendo que por amor idealizamos las cosas, adems que es sper dificil olvidar (te lo cuenta un futuro divorciado actualmente separado que ama y seguir amando toda su vida a mi futura exesposa) esa relacin..  pero si tu misma no te das la fuerza para cerrar ese captulo de tu vida, jams podrs olvidar y amar nuevamente.    2.- El seguir amando no es malo, pero concentrate en buscar a alguien ms a quien amar, no olvidars tu amor, solo por favor no concentres ese amor del pasado en la misma persona, porque as entrars en un barril del cual jams podrs salir, algunos libros te podran ayudar a superarlo, hay varios muy buenos.    3.- Sobre las cosas que segun tu, el siente por t, o lo estas idealizando o imaginando o bien estas perdiendo objetividad, esto es.. a veces por amor vemos las cosas como las queremos ver, no como realmente son....  no estas diciendo en ningun momento "el me ha dicho que an siente cosas por m"..  as que si no te lo dice, por favor no quieras descifrar ningun tipo de lenguaje asumiendo o creyendo cosas.    4.- tu misma lo dices.. "TERMINO"..  eso significa, se acabo, no ms... final.. pasa a la siguiente pgina.. por difcil que parezca..    5.- "se que me quiere por que lo siento", perdoname pero el tratar a alguien de forma amable, caballerosa, educada, linda, etc.. no significa que te ame, si te puede querer, pero de igual forma puedes querer a un hermano, a un familiar, a un amigo y eso no es igual a amor.. son dos cosas distintas, querer es ms como estimar y apreciar mucho a una persona y es diferente a amar.. amar es entregarte de forma incondicional ante cualquier circunstancia, ceder en todo sin importar tu, das el todo por el todo.. punto.. eso es amar a grandes rasgos... ?el dara la vida por ti en este instante? s es as, eso es amor...    6.- "lo s porque me lo ha dicho mucha gente".. all esta gran parte del problema, tu de una u otra forma no quieres olvidar, sigues preguntando o escuchando lo que dice la "gente".. si realmente quieres olvidar, dile a esa "gente" que no quieres saber nada ms de l, por salud.. porque lo quieres olvidar.. por lo que quieras... pero ya.. olvidate de l, no sepas nada de su vida, deseale lo mejor pero ya no tengas ms contacto con l, pidele a toda esa "gente" que no te cuenta nada ms de l.. y vers como pasado un tiempo sin querer saber nada ms de l te ayudara.. creo que este paso es el ms importante para olvidar.. no te preocupes en como le va bien, mal como sea.. simplemente deja de saber cosas de el.. no pienses en l, no le llames, no platiques con l.. NADA. y vers que si llegas a ese paso podrs olvidar realmente y seguir con tu vida..    Mencionas que l hace un tiempo te conto que se iba a casar.. ?crees que si te amara te lo contara?.. NO... si el te amara tambien, dejara a su novia/pareja o lo que sea.. y luchara de forma incondicional por tener tu amor, que ningun trabajo le costaria claro esta.. pero no.. te esta diciendo ME VOY A CASAR.. olvdame por favor es el mensaje oculto.. te esta diciendo, ya quiero o amo a alguien y es con esa persona que quiero vivir el resto de mi vida.. y tu ?aun as sigues creyendo que te quiere?..  Ya te dije y perdoname por insisitir, querer y amar son dos cosas muy diferentes, agua y aceite.. no se deben mezclar en un matrimonio.. deben de ser iguales: Querer-querer.. amar-amar...  No se vale que sea diferente en proporcion...    As de complicadas son las relaciones del corazon, tu crees que la muchacha no le llega ni a los tobillos.. o que puede ser un(a) patan(a).. ni modo, as es el amor de ciego.. te cierra los ojos y no te permite ser objetivo y ?sabes que es lo ms irnico? que an cuando tu creas que no lo merece, l va a ser feliz con esta chica.. por lo que quieras (sexo, lstima, humildad, porque le barrera, traperara, tratara como rey, lo celara) que se yo.. pero s as se va  a casar.. as es.. no justifiques, no critiques, no veas.. olvdalo.. no vuelvas a hablar o saber de l y vers que solo as lo olvidas...    Disculpame por no decir cosas lindas, pero quise ser honesto y franco contigo.    nimo querida amiga, no es fcil.. deseale lo mejor, que Dios me lo bendiga y cuide.. pero eso djaselo a Dios, no te quieras meter tu en saber de l..     No cuentas cuantos a?os tienes, pero supongo que eres joven, vers que algn da y cuando menos te lo esperes encontrars  a alguien que te ame tal como tu puedes amar y de esto ni te acordars..    Suerte.|`|k4skyTNGaa	Si de verdad sintiera algo por ti, no se casara con otra, mejor scalo de tu vida y valrate, alguien sabr quererte y hacerte feliz, no te cierres a la felicidad.|`|yWLcw9D6aa	Teniendo sexo con todos los que te lo propongan o se te antojen|`|mZNesA53aa	Luego de leer tu mensaje me puse a pensar en quienes te han dicho cunto te quiere, cunta pena sienten por la otra chica, etc. etc. etc. Vos ests segura de que l te quiere, decs que lo sabs porque lo sents, la gente te lo dijo, lo sabs porque lo conocs pero... Mi pregunta es: ?l te dijo que te quiere?   No analics por qu se casar con alguien a quien se considera de tan poca monta. Pens en por qu se queda con ella y no con vos.  A veces, mi querida, nos cuesta desprendernos del todo de una relacin en la que nos sentimos cmodas. Pero debemos dar por sentado que si se acab hace ms de dos a?os es por algo.

Al ver que esto no funciona, volvemos a caer al punto anterior. "es que con el las cosas eran asi...". Si el es para ti, habla con el, asi se dejan de lastimar y buscan como casarse!   Mi esposo fue mi primer novio a los 12 a?os. Termine con el, tuve otros novios pero nunca pude tener algo con alguien mas de 4 meses. La vida se dedico en juntarnos nuevamente.

BD2OIHJlaa	i shouldn't be answering this, cuz i'm a guy, but here's my 2 cents:     be affectionate, be romantic, be sexy, and be his for the night! Don't wait for him to ask, just do what he likes...    Forget cooking his favorite meal, pick something up on the way home. Your time can be spent with him, not pots and pans.|`|8I4Frndfaa	My husband calls me a couple of times a day, to say hi, to say I Love You.    Doing something sweet reinforces the behavior; it lets him know you appreciate it. I'd make him something you know he loves for dinner,  or bring home a little something you know he'll enjoy.    Be certain to tell him that you like what he did, and that it made you feel good.    Men can't read our minds, when they do these little things that are so special, they have to know.|`|5aae4cb0df904bf660f0e98d14a7d66caa	How about letting him know how much YOU LOVE HIM!!|`|25512b28dedb5738ac242400e7bf6f68aa	Let him know how much you appreciate things he does.  Most men show their love through actions(although yours obviously knows that a few loving words work wonders).  We wives often forget to appreciate the little things(and big things, like going to work) that our men do every day.  Just tell him how much you appreciate that he takes out the trash without being asked or gets your oil changed or whatever.  Of course, nakedness helps! Our guys are visual and most of them love sex so...|`|7VoiHvXnaa	My husband does stuff like that all the time.  I also do things like this for my husband.      You could got o hallmark.com and send him an e card.  It is free for you to create an account and you could send him a card via email.  I send them to my husband all the time.  Every time I send him one to work, he calls me and tells me that I made him smile and I really made his day by sending him the e card.    You could do something like that.  Let your imagination get creative.  I am sure whatever you do, your husband will love it.  Good Luck!!!!!|`|AA10146722	cook him something he loves|`|AA10195792	do you call him and tell him the same FIRST.....?|`|HBWvgBuvaa	I am married and I would love it if I came home and my wife said hey, let's take a shower together and she washed my hair, scrubbed my back and so on|`|UADSUILYaa	By him some flowers.  This will  come as a huge surprise for your husband, as women are usually the recipient of flowers.  I did this for my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago and he had tear filled eyes because he said that it was so special and sweet because he had never received flowers!|`|AA10008833	I call or text my wife an I luv you  a lot.....she does the same...the best though is when she sends me a saucy text message|`|93834399e4e9c69572f9242e040693c6aa	My husband does that when he's done something that will surely incite my wrath.  I'm always suspicious when he pulls stunts like that - and for good reason.  The last time he did, I came home to find that he wrecked our car.  If I were you, I would just tell him you love him back. Don't do anything special for him.  He'll start to expect it and will never reciprocate and then you'll just be bitter.  I have ZERO expectations of my husband.  I know he will go out of his way to do absolutely nothing. So, I don't go out of my way to do anything for him.  It keeps me sane and levels the playing field.  More women would be happy and stay married if they lower their expectations.  If you just expect  your husband to do nothing more than breathe, you'll be alright.|`|Ja7RldXGaa	Yes    My husband and I are divorced, we are currently dating and he calls or text messages me every morning just to say Hi and that he loves me and is thinking of me.

We call each other and start singing the corney song " I just called to say I love You, I just called to say how much I care"    Send your husband a racy picture on his cell phone :)|`|8a3da568d050731202110da78d36ac48aa	Awww.... *puke*!

Just return the favor when it's appropriate.|`|d406c0bf9c09a02179604a08c8a6e532aa	U're a lucky gal. mine doesn't do that.

pX9Kd7dBaa	Yes, and i'm still going through it.  I've actually been talking to the guy for about a year now.  Met him on a blog site.  The first thing that got my attention was his appearance.  I won't lie.  The man is drop dead gorgeous.  So it was definitely lust I felt when I first saw him.  I wanted him for my own.  Then when I was able to form a coherent thought I read his profile. And realized how very intelligent he was.  Suffice it to say after that I was hooked.  Sent the first message and I have no regrets.  He speaks several languages, English being one of them.  And he lives in Europe.   I believe and trust what he says to me, yes.  And it has also crossed my mind that it's a joke at my expense.  Not by anything he's done.  It's sort of a joke I have on myself.  The internet is a good way to find and connect with people from all over the world.  But on the negative side it can cause some misery.  Especially in my case.  It's ironic and cruel in a way...    It's kind of foolish really, but inevitable to feel something for someone of like mind that you happen to have met over the internet.  As to the question, is it "real" love, I think it all depends on the person and the situation.  It can definitley feel real.  But it's important to meet in real life before coming to such a conclusion.  And yes, it's worth it.|`|1fsqpqNbaa	It hapend to one of my cousins.   She meet a guy on line, on a chat room.    She lives in Mexico and the guy was  from Chile.  After exchangin pictures and several e-mails afetr sometime they became cyber girl and boyfriend.    Sfter 7 moths they guy took a pplane from Chile to Mexico to meet my cousin for the first time in person.  On that trip he proposed to my cousin and after little over a year they got married in Mexico.  They went and lived in Chile for sometime but now they are back in Mexico,   So far they been together for 5 years now and as far as I know they are happy.  I bet this is 1 case in thousand of even millions that end it up good.   In my personal opinion is not something I would try.

sU2NayEcaa	Are both of you friends? cause if so, and you have been together for a long time, You should tell her, that you love her, only if you've been together for a long time,     Like this: Sorry to bother you but can we talk for a second I have something to tell you (make your tone of voice more pleasing) then: I don't want to ruin our friendship but I Love you....

pRl1B1p9aa	Really, most women like a mix I think - I know I do. I hate a guy that is soft and effeminate and also hate a guy that is rough and uncaring. You just have to play it as you go I think. For the most part be gentle, though, and take HER lead.|`|gsW5jVbtaa	i'd would say a little bit of both, a mix of the two.|`|9fiSjToqaa	gentle slow when i'm sober.. rough and tough when i'm wasted.|`|WRdCITZCaa	i love rough tough one make me SCREAM GOD!|`|935513337d03c0511eb83e7e50038a95aa	It depends on the mood.

TgzqOtMOaa	Oh sweetheart i've been there.  You know he's such an asshole and all he does is break your heart, yet u can't help how your heart feels.  I stayed in a relationship like that for years, and no matter how many times he would break up with me and date other women, i would always be waiting when he came crawling back.  SWEETIE YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT!!!  hell yea it's gonna hurt.  your gonna miss him and the good times you've had, and the love will be there for a long time.  but the longer you're apart the easier it will get. it's easier said than done, but look at me now.   two days ago my ex actually called me and told me he apologized for being such an *** and now understood the saying 'you don't know what ya got til it's gone'.  you'll get there some day.  take it one day at a time.  make it throught the day without calling him and then applaude yourself.  don't accept his phone calls.  go out with friends.  start dating (not in order to replace him, just to have some fun).  just live your life without an asshold HOLDING YOU DOWN.  as time goes by things will only get better, and when he realizes what he lost.....it's the best feeling in the world!!!!
AA12348551	keep going, she'll eventually will want to feel even more 'dirty' ... ah, and that's why we use showers after sex, to clean up ... just go slow, and be more romantic, pay more attention to foreplay, make her feel comfortable, secure ... and horny.|`|05a73f0443731f1bb9ea9b90132e0187aa	women dont show their actual intentions.............. most of the time its opposite what they say and what they do............ i think she likes u......|`|8uF06LE3aa	She might be interested in someone else...|`|3oEFsp2Xaa	She feels a moral dilemna. I bet she is 16 and has a religious mom. just a guess.|`|93d7f98d34387a228fd65d120f0fa963aa	Maybe she has morals something that most of use don't even know about!! She also could have a problem with her selfastem, maybe she doen't love you that way,  to give you her life I think she's very smart to be causious with her heart. It takes a smart woman to hold off until marriage, I commend her, rah rah rah for her!!!!!!!!!!! Having sex is a very large commitment & if you love her & respect her you will wait until she's ready, if not then you don't deserve her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1mU7kWThaa	she probably has a low sex drive like my missus just spike her tea with female viagra and pow what her do the whole neighbour hood .........hahahahahahaha|`|P63mjv8raa	woman are beautiful  but very weird creatures    any man will tell you that  hahahaha|`|Nv4gtqEGaa	She's a girl, there all like this!|`|AA11094529	are you satisfying you,????? like many males you dont think about your partner,you have to try harder|`|9aFLLMs7aa	she may have been molested? or she doesnt like sex? find out which one, and if its neither, id look in to what she is interested in and take it from there|`|DYcqtio4aa	It could be do to religious ideas installed on her.  If that is it.   I feel bad for you.  Because it is very difficult to have a sexual relationship.  With someone who makes one feel like we were taking advantage of them.  At the end it will cause many problems.  Do to you feeling frustrated.  That you can't act adult and have to hold back.  With people like that one always has to hold back.  You ask how to take it.  Don't be ashamed to have sexual desires.  Just because she may be.  Remember  if she sees sex as dirty.  And the two participants are consenting adults.  That is her hang up not yours.    Be thankful your not married to her.|`|CuvDlD5baa	Maybe she is having commitment problems and thinks things are moving too fast? x|`|JyuoPnnKaa	Get rid of her and Masterbate at least you will be having sex with some one you really adore and likes you. You dont have to take yourself pout for dinner buy yourself flowers or wisper sweet nothings in your ear ( you can if you want to of course )|`|K9p45485aa	Are you doing something different?  Maybe you are doing something different that she doesn't like and makes her feel dirty and she is afraid to tell you.     Talk with her and find out what the problem is.|`|SVkPW2B8aa	She probably doesn't have that great of a sex drive.  If you've been together for six months, the initial glow of the relationship is starting to wear off.  She probably was really into sex in the beginning because it was new and you guys were developing a bond.  But now that you are emotionally close, she probably doesn't see the need to get sexual that often.  If it is that she has a low sex drive, you probably just need to get her in the mood--and that is the tricky part.  I wouldn't approach her wanting sex and making that known--that's a quick way to turn her off to the idea.  Being too forward with someone who says sex is gross is not the way to go.    What you should do is make her *want* it.  You've been together six months.  You must have some idea what turns her on...does she like a particular actor in a particular role?  Does she secretly get turned on by the sex scenes in movies?  Does a certain scent or song make her horny.  I'd suggest a search online for natural aphrodisiacs--usually spicy foods, silky fabrics and being touched in certain places on the neck or knees can bring any woman to her knees.  Also, if all else fails, getting her a little tipsy is a good way to lower inhibitions.  I'm not talking crazy drunk, but a glass or two of wine is the way to go.|`|b31d59df48ba7a2578d118dffa7f7e2daa	sounds like it's to do with the way she's been brought up by her family....  some people are raised to believe that sex is a bad thing, and therefore feel guilty for enjoying it.    all i can say is keep trying. make an effort to find out what she likes...  try to be open about your sex life together.  the more u talk about it,   the easier it will get for her.  she just needs to learn that sex isn't a bad thing when u are involved in a loving, caring relationship.|`|vmZ3mR0Yaa	,Some women Love the idea of having sex, but see the act of putting something inside them that you have in you trousers all day getting sweaty or that you wee through as disgusting. A possible idea is to shower together allowing you to wash together/each other. It might be a good way to start.|`|jt1p1Qayaa	ive read most of the comments and noticed one thing nobody has mentioned....her past? have you ever considered or talked about the fact she may have had a bad experience.ill admit that i was raped at the age of 13 and with every new man i slept with, i was turned off. no matter who your with it always comes back to haunt you. even if it wasnt rape...maybe just attempted or something along those lines. its only now after 9 months with my fiance and 7 years later  that i truly feel over my past experience. i used to enjoy sex but not to a full extent and could often feel turned off. myt b something to consider. a certain touch can bring back that memory and instantly change your mind about doing it or not. its weried to describle and you probably dont understand what im trying to say but its worth a try.
649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Hey you don't have to panic,he must be really busy and probably when he comes back from work he must be too tired and may be that's the reason he can't call you!Even he must be missing you a ton and may also feel bad as you do as he may not be able to give you a buzz.  Don't misunderstand him and if he calls you from china the least is to argue with him on this issue.Speak to him in a nice way.  Am sure when he gets time and is free he will call you, if he doesn't remember he too misses you just like you do.You could at least say that out on yahoo answers, he can't even do that!  hey do send him emails if he can't.....why always wait for him to call or email, you too could give a start :)  Good luck
NbWPxSU9aa	no woman likes her body. The last thing on a man's mind during sex is the appendix surgery scar on your stomach, or the dimples in your thighs, or that your stomach isn't washboard.  Its the way you respond, that men like. Men are just as concerned about their bodies too, they may have anxiety because they wished their packages were larger-it doesn't matter, nobody is perfect. Better to be okay with it and move on than miss out on good sex and relationships because of insecurities.|`|4866956fcf21eb3c3db3529321c47534aa	do it in the dark|`|rLdlhxJ6aa	Dont be guilty. be proud of what you gotss|`|AA11426515	Be proud of what you have and be happy that the guy is interested in you. If you are too self-conscious of your body, how can you even enjoy sex with him?     If you start talking to him about your body, it may trigger him to start wondering if you expecting him to have a perfect body too.    This guy who is interested in you, should be interested in the overall package - your looks, personality, character, body, job, family and friends. If there is any part that he isn't entirely happy with, he has to adjust. After all, no one is PERFECT except GOD.

cypAgYSXaa	uuuff!    de varias formas.    el torax, besos en el pecho, por las costillas.    besos, muchos besos en la boca, pero con un poco de lengua.    Tambien cuando la mujer mueve la cadera en forma circular como si estu biera bailando reggaeton, al momento de estar penetrando claro.    aliento en el cuello y mordiscos suabes,    y un poquito de ara?adas suabesitas en la espalda, dependiendo la posicin.    tambien es muy exitante para el hombre, ver la penetracion, eso es para su placer visual, como por ejemplo la posicn a la que la mayora llamamos la del "perrito"  eso es bueno, ver los organos sexuales haciendo su funcin.    tambien exita mucho el sexo orl, eso es de las mejores armas para exitar a un hombre, al igual ue a una mujer claro, creo yo.    tambien dejar al hombre explorar al 100% el cuerpo de su pareja es muy exitante.        bueno pues      espero y te sirva esa informacion.      ciao!    y mucho mas...|`|KMykbV1eaa	 Su seguridad en si misma el mejor afrodisiaco.|`|tKDU2jjdaa	jajaja puessss  las carisias  en lo personal  todo de una mujer, las carisias , los besos  todo..  espero te sirva  hahaa|`|6vZwptQRaa	LOS SONIDOS CREO YO...

Que busque slo su satisfaccin no importando la satisfaccin de su pareja, entonces slo pide y pide y se frustra si le dicen que no.  Ese grupo incluye muchos adictos al fetiche, a "experimentar", algunos etiquetadores de mujeres como "beatas", "de mente no abierta", etc. si les dicen que no gustan de esos "experimentos", etc.  Hasta este punto todo es bien crudo y bsico. No importa si la chica es bonita y buena persona  si es bonita y una bruja, lo nico que importa es que l obtenga lo que quiere. Comentarios de tinte machista abundan en este grupo.  En la parte intermedia estn los que ya empiezan a pensar en su pareja tambin, a la hora de la relacin sexual, sepan tcnicas o no.  Estos hombres ya preguntan, experimentan con amor y respeto y empiezan a escuchar la opinin de la mujer y les gusta ser escuchados. Comparten. Aqu ya empieza el sexo con amor.  Y en la parte ms apetecible estn aquellos que se han preocupado por aprender que ha satisfecho a las parejas que ha tenido en su vida y a l mismo cuando hacen el amor. Realmente ven la relacin sexual como algo ntimo y de a dos. Tienen paciencia, ense?an y no tienen ningn problema si son ense?ados. No hay la barrera del orgullo machista.

Stay with your current to see how it works out, if it doesn't work out, at least you can say that you weren't being a jerk and that you did try to make it work with her. Also if you stay with the current it'll make the ex jealous and by the time you're done with this girl the ex will want you even more.|`|jshJjflNaa	ur ex prolly only wants u back bc now ur taken... girls r stupid like that... i know for a fact girls r stupid... bc i am a girl.. lol..   but at the same time she might really like u depends on when we started acting like she wants u back was it when she found out u have a new gf or was it a while after or even maybe before... all kinda depends on things like that..|`|IuSfCtN9aa	the one that you love the most even though you will hurt the other one. if you love your ex more than your current, then choose your ex. what matter is your satisfaction because you are the one going to live with it.|`|dF5clN4daa	My ex girlfriend called me after 5 years of silence.... I thought I was in love but the reunion definitely proved to me that time changes everything.... The good thing was this - I was finally able to put her out of my mind and make my current girlfriend (now my wife) the number 1 all-time woman in my heart.  Now, not knowing anything else about your situation, I would say don't even waste your time with your ex... but instead, love the one your with.|`|FPFUhbDuaa	definitely your current gf your ex probably only wants you back because you've moved on, and she can't mess with your head anymore.  girls are crazy like that.  also if it didn't work the first time and you 2 haven't resolved all your issues then they will probably just come back up and it probably will end for the same reasons it did the first time.|`|dh8QUfywaa	Go with the new one.

8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	Your pregnant daughter does have one other option to not disrupt your daughters wedding plans and you desire to see her get married (and you should see her get married) she can inquire about a c-section. Please don't get angry that was not my intent.    Or, you can have an open ticket to fly where your daughter will be giving birth then if you have to leave in a hurry you will not have to worry about a flight.    Your daughter that is getting married will truly and for the end of time will always know you have missed her wedding because you will not be in her wedding pictures.    As for the daughter that is having the baby there are so many variables on how that can play out because naturally born babies don't come on time ever. I think your pregnant daughter will understand, she is going to be a mother and is learning what mother's sacrifice for their children.     If you have to you can split the day either leave early or late but your new grandbaby will decide for you. But, have a plan and relieve the stress.   Shalom  |`|anDOwZXNaa	OH MY GOD.  i think you should be there for the one getting married.  it wouldn't be fair to the one getting married  besides, your other daughter, the one giving birth, will be fine.  :]   and, you already went to her wedding  |`|DbCO4ThNaa	Hmmm sounds like a sticky situation. I would say have a talk with both of them and see how they feel. Is your expecting daughter have anyone else to be in the hospital with her? If  I had to choose I would go see the birth of my grandchild. Your other daughter should understand. You can only be born once!!!!!|`|YJqw5Vtxaa	I'd definitely go to the daughter having the child. This is a very serious situation for her and her health and well being are involved, as well as the one of a newborn. If your daughter thats getting married loves you and her sister she should understand that you should be with her this time, she needs you especially because the father of the baby is not going to be there. You can always go some days later to celebrate the wedding of your other daughter.|`|I6H1Y7Bjaa	How does the daughter having the baby feel about the situation?  Would she consider coming to live with you for the birth so that you could also be close to her before and after the event?  This may allow her to still attend her sister's wedding, as well as, have more family support.  The reason I suggest living with you is because the daughter having the baby may be familiar with doctors in your area and she would need more family support with the father away.  I also know that it is hard to change the date for the church and reception area at the last minute.  Talk to each daughter and follow your heart.  Could there also be an aunt available for back up and/or share responsibility in helping to care for daughter having the baby since the father will be away?|`|OWUwYrtxaa	She won't change the date of her wedding when her sister is about to deliver a baby?  Strange...    Who will be there for the birth of the baby? If there are any health issues or she will have nobody there then absolutely go to the birth of your grandchild.    If she will have somebody supporting her and there are no health concerns then go to the wedding and catch a red eye to your other daughter.    Personally I'd try and arrange a 3 way conference call and talk it through with both daughters together so they can feel how torn you are. Maybe dates can be changed?|`|ufKGG4tYaa	Wedding, because you never know if she will actually deliver that day. Generally not many women want their family members there when they are giving birth but if your daughter doesnt mind it cant hurt. Still you should go to the wedding.    Plus if you miss a wedding your daughter will hate you more then the one giving birth. I dont think your daughter even invited you to the hospital while shes giving birth did she?|`|QTsRDWlfaa	The other daughter should change her wedding date.  Doesn't she want her sister there? BUT if you must choose you need to be with your daughter having the baby, she needs support, your other daughter will have everyone she needs there, she sounds a little selfish to me, sorry just my opinion.|`|rnMRYBEuaa	In my opinion, pushing a human being out of your uterus is more traumatizing and esp. without the baby's father there for support..,.  Your other daughter's wedding.. she'll be surrounded by alot of people and she'll have alot of "support" but your daughter is going to be a mother and she needs her own mother's support.|`|PNuPl0d4aa	Oh gosh. That's tough!!    I think i would go to the wedding, because once it's over; it's over. You can go straight to the baby afterward, but if you miss the wedding, you've missed the most important day of your daughter's life and there's no going back. The baby will be here for years, and I'm sure she can find someone else (a best friend) that will go with her.|`|1c3abc8401d22bbca7f2a1ebcecc072caa	Since i have two daughters, both grown, here's my answer. Attend the marriage of the one daughter, hopefully it will be a one man one woman relationship down through the years. Then hop a plane and go to the birth or go to see the new grandchild. Simple. No ones feelings are hurt, you've attended the first marriage of your daughter, then gone to witness the birth, or see the new born grand-daughter.|`|uFzDPWu5aa	first of all why wont the father be there for the birth??  but anyway id be there for the wedding because youve already gone to your other daughters wedding..  and make up to my other daughter by helping her take care of her newborn so she can get some sleep when she needed it  |`|Sn4voeKvaa	I think I would be with the pregnant daughter. First, tell you daughter that is getting married the problem tell her that you love them both the same but your other daughter won't have anyone she loves with her to see the birth of her first born (or whatever) but then tell her that her dad will stay and tell her that you would love to here all about it after you get back from the hospital. Tell her that you love her very very very very very very much and that you wish her the best wishes for her wedding and to take lots and lots of pics|`|T0Oma9nhaa	Do both of the girls know this situation? How far apart is the Due-Date and the wedding date? If they are two weeks apart, you can do both. Perhaps the daughter getting married can help with the travel$$ I also have 2 daughters. I would Myself would be with my daughter in the hospital, as this can be a VERY serious situation and you truly do need someone who cares about you WITH YOU!  Giving Birth is very important as well as a wedding. You can be with your daughters anytime but I think I would choose my daughter giving birth as there COULD BE SERIOUS COMPLICATION'S INVOLVED! But, let us stay positive and hope ALL GOES well with the BIRTH! A happy healthy Mom and Baby!  We already know that the one getting married is Happy and Healthy!  You are an Excellent Mom and the girls love you and will understand either way!  iCiKnow~|`|PFidHqNfaa	damn thats hard!  ummm.......wedding lol..cuz the due date might be a little later|`|iptZvCmEaa	Tough choice,  Maybe you can go to the wedding (if you have time)  but not the After party  after the wedding go to your other daughter  having the baby   ( :|`|kFVz2Heyaa	thats so sad!!! im sorry! but you only have one wedding many more children will come. you can see the baby someother time|`|2efqrdTdaa	well for me i would rather be at the wedding since you cannot live that over again. Your other daughter and get pregnant again so their might be a chance you can be at one of the births. |`|FYjgmJ6Taa	the wedding. you can't DO anything regarding a birth, unless your a doctor.|`|hLGZmvcNaa	why dont you get the pregnant daughter to come to a hospital around where the marriage is at and maybe she will be in labor that day and you can just stop by the marriage and see them get marrried and go onto the hospital|`|SSMv3Ma2aa	wedding because she could always video tape having the baby, a wedding will probaly not happen again|`|xygGqwwPaa	idk thats really hard!!!  i would probably go with the 1 having the baby|`|WWkhrPgJaa	owi!  thats tough!      hmmmm  probably go to the wedding.... i dont know......   ya. go to the wedding!  :D|`|Mg6PEstHaa	 Definitly go to the wedding|`|JE2icEVsaa	the baby...  people can always get remarried.  but a baby is only born once.|`|qB30CTJPaa	this is a really hard question!      i would pick the wedding!  because:  1. its on a certain date (unless it gets changed, which i doubt would happen)  and  2. the baby could be either late or early|`|685c12b25f53b84d2e7f08c3856482e1aa	You better talk to the daughters and explain to them why you're in a pickle. hopefully they will be able to decide for you. If one of them is not willing to say the other is more important skip both events because they are too selfish. |`|2JymDhgdaa	Isn't your pregnant daughter going to her own sisters wedding? The wedding will sure be memorable.|`|Q8a1WXBZaa	I would go to the one thats pregnant, she seems to need more help than the other. Hope the one who is getting married understands.|`|3cR8f1Hoaa	Baby!    I'm sorry haha|`|HQFztPRcaa	I would pick which ever one you want to go to and video tape the other.

AA11298660	Think about it. The only one who didn't have family was the first primate that climbed out of the swamp.Plus you either have, or have had family whether they're alive or dead. You had to have had a mother and father to be here and their parents before them...any brothers or sisters and their offspring.......    If you're questioning why we have family because of disbelief at what they're like, remember you can choose your friends, but not your family.|`|wqchA8B7aa	It has been argued by many sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers and psychoanalysts that the primary function of the family is to perpetuate societyEither socially, with the "social production of children", or biologically, or both. Thus, one's experience of one's family shifts over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a family of orientation: the family serves to locate children socially, and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization. From the point of view of the parent(s), the family is a family of procreation the goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children. However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between two people, is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	How do you think babies would do if mothers just left them where they were born?|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	See what happens is, a man and a women get together and do the deed, 9 months later a child is born.

If you really like her, just mention it to her and find out if she's just looking or if she means something by it. Look at it this way, she's with you and not with any of them, that's gotta mean something, no?  Everyone does it, it's just natural|`|Zu0zvqseaa	She may just be curious about other men or it could mean she's moved on. For now, give her the benefit of the doubt. If you see any other signs such as flirting, winking, and other things such as that its time to have a talk. If she seems to be unintrested in you, its time for you to start checking out other women and dump her.|`|S6WJ4xrpaa	Jut because your girl looks at other guys doesn't mean you should dump her. Like if some kid walked by and it so happened to be a guy obviously she's gonna look at them. She's just focused on her surroundings. Just tell her that you noticed that she was looking at other guys and see what she says.|`|SaHt5GXeaa	You should tell her how you feel. I never done that to my partner, We've talked about it and he loves and respect me for it. Plus I love being able to talk about things that make us feel uncomfortable. It shows that we are always working hard to keep ur relationship strong.|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	Don't you look at other women?|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	Quit being so insecure. She's with YOU. I'm sure you look at other girls walking by.|`|tsQYHCL9aa	well if its really obvious and does it on purpose then thats not really fair on you :/ so maybe you should dump her or look at girls when shes with you and make her the jealous one :)|`|q2AsDnjpaa	You should ask her why she does. see if her answer is good enough.  Don't you ever look at other girls?|`|kv5t5q4Caa	Maybe she likes it when u get jealous. It shows u love her.|`|brgewnhRaa	dump her
aOjMf5SPaa	Do as you like, you'll leave a lasting impression and you'll end up with the right guy. Truthfully, you are not a slag, you are confident and fiesty.

Do as you please and raise the standards!!!!|`|qDpFSqn4aa	NOT AT ALL, THEY ARE WELL ROUNDED AND EXPERIENCED.  I'VE HAD MORE FUN WITH THOSE KINDS OF WOMEN.  IN FACT, I'VE SEARCHED OUT THOSE KIND OF WOMEN BEFORE.  I LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE JUST NOT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT GETS BORING AFTER A WHILE.  IF YOU CAN HOLD OFF AND SLIP IN SOMETHING NEW EVER SO OFTEN THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP FOR SOME LUCKY GUY.

Im the same way.|`|A7QUjI8eaa	If you do EVERYTHING in bed on the first date then guys would think you were a **** and would know that you do that with everybody else on the first date.  But, if you are doing things with someone that you are in a serious relationship with then I think most guys would like that.|`|AA11706291	If you like to do everything with everyone then yes I would say you were a bit of a slag giving it all out to anyone however if you are in a stable loving relationship and do everything then I think that's only the business between you and your partner and lets face it if they thought you were a slag why would they sleep with you?!    Also is this question really that important and urgent that you had to shout the whole thing?|`|Joz0jTwGaa	if u do everything - do it only with the special one. u know like a bf who has really fallen in love with u or has expressed long term interest. then it wd be exciting for him. but in general guys will enjoy it but diss on u later on.|`|a59579ec8aee8902f555d4fccd5299e6aa	A little mystery and overcoming resistance can be a sexy thing.

It's simply pleasing and satisfying yourself and your man, as long as you guys are in a relationship it's fine...it's just showing that your very comfortable with your sexuality and is very confident with yourself and most women are not.|`|lzjtINvCaa	I think thats fine.|`|ClCQIjZHaa	Not at all everyone is different in bed you can do anything to me x|`|ks2oieV0aa	Isn't this something that only your Boyfriend or Husband would know?  xox|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	as long as your not sleeping around with loads of diffrent men then no you are not a slag|`|oyZEs1Fxaa	nope...if its with many person then yess!!!|`|CM0J3RDWaa	no it dont, everyone does it|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Well boys like to feel special and if they think you've done it all before with other men they won't like it!    You are coming acros a bit loose though, I mean why share this on Yahoo answers? Attention?
L5ioX6r1aa	Its hard to tell you what's up. It could be anything you mentioned. IT could very well be that he is just not that into you. But you need to go ask him. Ask him if you want to take the relationship to the next level. If he still says no, then tell him that you can't be in a relationship where you feel "stuck" and not being cared for as much as you should.    good luck|`|GEmNqEwSaa	This year, I've learned that as women sometimes we could be "extra". Now that he's comfortable with you, he might not feel the need to be right under you BUT if it is bother you, bring up the issue with him. Let him know. If he doesn't give you an answer you would like to hear, it's your choice to stay and put up with it or not.|`|YsxBhoLbaa	yep. you're overreacting. you're also expecting too much attention and you're also paranoid.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	If you went from seeing him alot to not seeing him much in 5 months, most likely he is seeing someone else or losing interest. Why not confront him and ask him what is going on? He would know better than anyone here would.|`|cDDZB5oZaa	5 months is a good time to demand clarity. Are you mutually exclusive? Do you know each other's social circles? If all of this is clarified, I believe it will be much easier for you to remain secure. I believe that if you wish you can probably convince him to either call more or see you more often. Don't demand both. You could simply say "I feel like I hardly get to see you!" or something equally unaccusing. Make plans and take initiative. Plan a movie, a dinner, and bowling for three different days that week. Be flexible. He'll appreciate the effort. If he doesn't, he's flagging and you're better off with someone who will give you their undivided attention.
bKiwRl83aa	Yes.
eYGgd8Lcaa	I am sorry I do not have an answer for you, but more of a "thank you" for posing a question I've been wanting to ask for a long, long time, but was too fearful of the truthful answer. I am in love with a man who suffers from Parkinsonism and has horrific mood swings. Some days sweet. Some days doesn't acknowledge me. I wish you many prayers in your relationship with this individual. I think you must be a wonderful and strong, loving person. I hope that someone here will be able to give you words of comfort and wisdom.

What I want/need is someone who's:    Faithful (never cheats on me or uses me)   Trustworthy (doesn't lie and same as above really)  Supportive  Understanding  Caring/loving/kind    I like a good sense of humor.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Those aren't the same question.  Is your question about a husband-wife related (which is only illegal if they are spouses and in many states, first cousins but anything else isn't illegal).    Or is your question on multiple wives?  Where do you live b/c that's illegal?  In the US you'd call her a cheap piece of trash on the side who lives in an illusion where she actually thinks she's married.    In other countries, you'd just call her by her name since you share a husband.  Occasionally you might refer to her as His Second Wife since the First Wife is usually the senior position.
rV1uAtt3aa	You're not the first girl who's lied about her age, and I have to tell you it always ends in one of two ways:    1) The liar fesses up and either the people she lied to don't care or (more often) they do care and treat the liar like she is a jerk;    2) The liar never fesses up and either someone else tells the people being deceived the truth (which is usually it for the liar), or the people being lied to put the liar in a situation where she is in above her head.    So, the best you could hope for would be admitting the lie and hoping the people forgive you.  The worst is that you could be put into a situation that is dangerous for you (such as being pressured into having sex, driving a car, or drinking alcohol.)  The reality will probably be in the middle; you'll be found out and they'll think you're a loser.    However, based on your options, your best chance is to come clean since the worst outcome in that scenario isn't the worst possible outcome; while the best outcome in that scenario is they stay your friends anyway.    Good luck.|`|zhk8o514aa	"don't gimme that honesty is the best policy stuff ."     Fine, if you want to base your relationship on a lie..go right ahead.  BTW in 2 years they will be 18 thus you will be jailbait.   When they hit that age..you'll have some huge explaining to do.|`|YTasscmKaa	You tell the Truth. Being dishonest with people is no way to be their friend.|`|dMA2Acrpaa	jus tell him ur 13, he gonn be like "nuh uh". u jus b like "yea". n keep ya relationship goin|`|lbmFP6ayaa	lol what do u mean you may have a future with him..dude your only 13 ...u made me giggle =P|`|QjavEeQXaa	wow I have never been in a situation like that. But as a 14 yr old I have dated a 17 yr old and I had to dump him in the end.|`|EXq2QYqOaa	Well, you know that honesty is the best policy, so why even ask? You need to tell the truth because, if things advance sexually, he can go to jail for statutory rape. I'm not saying that it will get that far, but why build a friendship on a lie? If you tell him the truth and he dislikes you because of it, then you shouldn't have been with him in the first place. There are too many other guys out there to be sitting around, lying to just one so he "likes you more". You're better than that.|`|UqUz2aASaa	Their is a saying, "The truth shall set you free" which goes a long way. You need to come clean now, otherwise you'll end up telling more lies to cover for the ones you've told already, creating a never ending cycle of lies.|`|9GDFLNyiaa	First of all, not to be rude or anything, but your 13. You dont have futures with people yet.     Secondly, you should tell the truth. They'll find out eventually anyway, and then you'll just look like a dumb little girl looking for attention. But then again, they'll probably be mad if you do tell them.     But, it's better to tell them now before anything happens between you and one of them, (if it is going to happen), because if you do something with one of them and then they find out that you're only 13, it'll cause some major ****.     Just be honest. It's better that way and you never know. They may be ok with it and still want to be your friend.|`|NWwGl4k6aa	they know already.  they're just humoring you.|`|YMnTveWuaa	You have to do 16 year old things with them.|`|aZ9CGbYoaa	hes to old for you|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Lie until it gets serius. Tell him after you make love to him. jk|`|m3H1A4W1aa	Do not tell him your real age i mean 16 and 13 thats a big age gap at those years.  I think you should just continue getting to know this guy and then in time maybe tell him and then if he really likes you it shouldnt matter to him but also a 16 year old boy is only interested in one thing.....you 13 you really need to think about whether you want to get involved with this at your age!  Hope this helped :)|`|lkxFy681aa	tell them.    Firstly, if you ever did anything sexual with them, they can get arrested.  Secondly, nobody likes a liar.  Tell them the truth.     You can't force these guys to like you.|`|N2e248rTaa	tell them - if they aren't interested then they are just pathetic.|`|6lGpDk93aa	they know it    It is kinda of hard to mistake 13 as 16    They want you.... guys always act like they like someone, even if they dont, they just want to look good, see if he really likes you|`|9JmpXIoYaa	I think you should tell them now, before they find out later when they could be mad. If you tell him in a long time then its not going to work out. And why are are you asking a question and telling people how to answer. Might as well not even ask.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Be honest!    You asking for problem.  What if both of you end up having sex.  Do you know its an offense to have sex with an under aged even though you are a willing party?|`|TbAHRJataa	Just keep that lie.It is not a lie,when it not harm anyone.And if you tell them now...they will make their mind you as a lier.So just hang with them...If they caught you...just tell them,you didn't answer with knowledge.    And when you hang with him,just tell your real age.And I don't think that guy keep your age in his mind....|`|WxhUM1Njaa	look my sista is 13 and every one emails her flirts with her and I am 16 if you look 16 I don't think you will have a problem with him there are alot of guys that like that fact you are younge and I guess its that macho thing "I got a younge shorty" and they will like you alot so see I would tell them I am 13 but if you feel you should go ahead with 16 make sure that your choice|`|SS67T3dOaa	Sorry, but I have to tell you that honesty is your best friend. lol    If he's really a nice guy, he will not have a problem with your age, especially if he really likes you. But I think your parents will. I don't think it's much of a difference, I think it's better to be honest all the way with these guys and your parents if and when you hook up with this guy you like. Since you pass for a 16yr old, then he should be ok. Be careful and responsible with your actions. Good luck!|`|xU9Qhczqaa	tell him your 13    if he really likes you he wont care    if he asks you why you lied    tell him the truth|`|H9k65Ve0aa	What will you do when they find out you are just 13, and it will happen.  What are you going to say then, as you know friendship is based on  honesty. How do you think they will think about you just for lying. It is a simple lie, but will carry a bigger impact than you think.|`|RcZ6MEzBaa	honesty is the best policy.|`|snrGJdZUaa	You obviously just want permission to keep letting them think you are 16.  Do what you think is best.  But, of course, telling the truth would make like a lot easier.|`|MfjWoVtgaa	I honestly think that u should tell them ur real age. A) because you will get caught out one day and the longer you leave it and they find out - they won't trust u and u will lose all friendship. B) they might pressure u into doin something that u don't want to do - sex mainly, going to parties - drinkin 2 u pass out. Don't start that people will lose respect for you|`|njxxUBjeaa	i wouldnt tell them until you know them more and then be like ohh yeahh hahah im actually 13!  they probablly wont mind as much. if even at all  =]|`|YbOYwlwMaa	if you really think that youre relationship is going to go somewhere with him, then tell him the truth & if he really does like you then it shouldnt matter to him. hes gonna find out eventually and he'll only be matter when he finds out youve been lying to him.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Lie like a rug|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Some times you mess things up that can't be fixed.

qDpFSqn4aa	OK, it sounds like this guy is too childish for you or he just is tired of going without sex and wants you back into his bed...I mean life.  I don't see much happening with this kid.  He doesn't really know what being in a good relationship is all about.  You know guys mature slower than girls and you may need a guy who is a few years older than you in order to get one who is grown up enough for you.  Now don't think all guy older are mature.  I know several guys in their 20s and 30s who have yet to grow up.  This is why God inventing dating so you can learn each other and see if they are the right person for you.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|73dEt59yaa	well it sounds to me like he just want a reaction from you and he was annoyed when he didn't get 1. Iv been with a few ppl who like to play games and they are not worth the time, just ignore him or if you want to be mates then ignore the bad texts and only reply to the friendly texts (none of the nasty, sarcastic, flirty or dirty ones)|`|om61WSowaa	hes playing games.  ignore him and move on.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	ve careful! boys who play games end up the girl gets hurt and doesnt know f she can trust him anymore!|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Mine is doing the same thing! He'll quit talking for a week and then all of a sudden shoot a text like "are you still alive?!". So annoying! In a way you want to reply because you think maybe he's gone back to the way he was before, but in a way you want to just forget about it and ignore him like he did you. It's confusing and frustrating. He wants to talk when you don't, and you want to talk when he doesn't.     A lot of times guys view their ex as just "booty call", especially if you two got too intimate too soon, like I did with mine. Sometimes they act like they want to be friends, sometimes they act like they don't even care about you, and sometimes they just act like they want to get into your pants.     You need to talk about what went wrong with your relationship...sit down with him in person, call him, or go on AIM, whatever's convenient for both of you at a time when neither of you is busy. Tell your side of the story and let him tell his. Maybe this ill help both of you understand things a little better. Good luck!|`|e0IFrVyfaa	God guys are so annoying! x

If you love yourself and confident about yourself it will show.  You have to be giving because love is giving not getting.  You'll have to make her feel that quality, you have to be sharing and caring.  Make her trust you so that she feels that your sincere, honest and for real.  She has to feel it not decide in her mind that she loves you. FEEL. that's the magic word.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	This is something that either will happen or it won't.

Good luck!|`|joDZLoc0aa	You have to like the things she likes. Be interested in what she says. Listen to her. Don't be fake, because girls can see right through that. Be sweet and charming, but don't over do it. Make her feel special, by doing little things. Call her just to hear her voice, right her sweet little notes and let her find them. Again, make her feel special!

I had a wretched MIL too, but I finally figured out that my complaints about her only hurt him and I loved him. If he wants to continue a relationship with her, that is his business. You have no obligation to see or speak to her. As for the kiddos, you never have to leave them alone with her, but you can't really stop them from seeing her. Stop talking about your MIL negatively...your husband already knows what she is like and your kids will learn. If you take the high road, your kids will learn a lesson in what being a classy lady is all about.|`|2hAuIg5baa	ok either way you look at it shes still his mother and hes never gonna see your point of view because shell always be his mother and hell always love her no matter what.  you cant denie her accsess to your kids no matter how badley she treated you thats not fair on her,your husband and definatly not fair on your kids, they have a right to know there grandmother.  the problem is between you and her,nobody else so please dont involve other people into it especially your children unless she gives your children weed which proberbly isnt likely!    why dont you stay away from her and let your husband bring the kids over to visite, im sorry but your just going to have to deal with this because if you dont its just going to cause majour problems in your marriage and with your kids and there way more important than your mother in law!  im sorry if its not what you wanted to hear but its the best addvise i can give but good luck with your situation and i hope you do the right thing and it all works out :)
HQsmRzPsaa	well you are lucky she didn't beat your *** because if my FIANCE got someone else pregnant a few months before we should be getting married i wouldn't be with him anymore.|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	Honestly, you need to understand that just because you feel bad doesn't make it any easier for her. Her emotions are going to be unpredictable and this is something that she is going to need to deal with on her own. Sure you can have conversations with her and whatnot, but she's lost her trust in you and thats going to take you a great deal of work to get back. She might never completely trust you again, even if she decides to work everything out. I am speaking from experience. And Not only did you cheat, but you are having a child by another woman who is not her. This isn't something that cannot be fixed over night, or even within a few months. this is a topic that could potentially affect the rest of your lives especially if the child is involved. I sincerely hope everything works out for the two of you and I hope you are being genuinely sorry for your actions and i hope she can truly and completely forgive you sooner than later. However, i'm not so sure you deserve it.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Why oh why did you choose to tell her now ? She has every right to feel hurt, angry, annoyed and downright used.  You wanted to tell her so that you could ease the burden off your shoulders well now she has it squarely on hers, well done. If that were me I would not want to marry you at all, I would be so hurt that you chose to tell me two months in front of our wedding day let alone why you did it at all.  I think you are skating on very very thin ice, if you were a man at all you would break with her and let her have time to think about what she wants to do, if she wants to go through with marrying you then you are in for a very bumpy ride for as long as she feels necessary.  What a fool, you have been.|`|G1boIrFuaa	You need to have an honest, open conversation with your fiance, with no distractions.  Both of you need to approach this calmly and rationally.  You shouldn't be getting married if she can't trust you.  Hold off, if need be.  Be prepared to answer a lot of hard questions, but don't offer details unless she wants them.  Is she prepared to have you pay child support for the next 18 years?  If you love each other and want to make it work, then it will be WORK.  I cheated on my fiance almost a year ago and there are still issues that arise because of it, but I know that what he and I have is worth it so I work hard at our relationship.|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Honestly she's probably just going to make you stay around till the wedding then embarrass you before the wedding some how cuz obviously she has to get even with you! How she's able to even be in the same room with you without tearing you to shreds is beside me I would havealready killed you!!|`|aa7932143314ae59c91eb730b8572e37aa	You don't need an answer on here, you need a brain transplant.     You cheated on her, got a girl pregnant and think that sorry is going to cut it? Life is not a soap opera, you muppet.    Given that she has led you to believe that you are still going to get married next month, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, because she will punish you for a long, long time.     You know you're getting off lightly, so take your medicine or get out. But I'm wondering why you still want to go through with the wedding given that your head has already been turned BEFORE you got married.     Quite incredible. Maybe you could get a 20 minute slot on Ricki Lake or another sleazy daytime show?|`|u4910BFfaa	Are you for real?  "You can't deal".  Get a grip and a package of condoms so you do not screw up the life of anyone else.  Selfish pile!|`|YsVAOOkOaa	this look of being normal is because it hasnt sunk in yet, it will take maybe a month or more for her fully come to terms with what you have done.     im sorry but if i was you i would leave her as she deserves so much better and you can not act as if she is giving you the cold shoulder you deserve what she is doing to you. so if she leaves you (or visa versea) thats for the best as once the trust has gone in a relationship it will never come back again as there will always be the under lying feelings of her wondering will you do it again...|`|441GSyaMaa	You did put yourself in this situation and she's so clever for being like that. She'll always hold it against you and such.    She has let you off very lightly, and (as i said) clever... she sounds like a decent person.. why cheat?|`|AA11702934	Forget about getting married in March.  Burning in the depths of Hell is less painful than life with a scorned woman.  Although your truthfullness is admirable, your girlfriend's probably gonna be bitter and hateful for a long time.  Who knows if she'll ever be able to truly forgive and forget.  You should run for the hills.  And next time, be a good boy and keep that thing where it belongs!|`|OsbodPySaa	She's probably in shock that you did that. That is the only reason I can see her being calm about it.   And if your getting married in March, she probably would feel embaressed calling off the wedding if you broke it off.    You need to talk to her and find out if she really wants to marry you now.    And dude, your a peice of ****.|`|D5CVoI7Yaa	ok... first off.. i cant believe u would do that to a woman you love!!!!  sorry had to say that...  and.. i have a little respect for you for actually telling her..  that takes alot of guts to do..  and by the way she is acting..  she loves u dearly... but is torn to pieces about it.. like she prob feels she isnt good enough for you... it hurts bad to be cheated on..  she wants u to stay with her.. but she is hurt... and u just need to prove to her that u love her.. she wants reassurance....|`|ztgwpqxGaa	just be glad im not ur partner!!  you cant deal with her being like this?  what bloody planet do u live on?  want my advice? if you love her you'l take every bit of **** she gives you and eat it!!  you ought 2 grovel ur backside off buddy!  would u really be so understanding if 1 day she came 2 u n told u she was pregnant 2 another man?  somehow i dont think so?!|`|ObJTgBafaa	You PIG!!!!!!!|`|afSqgYBZaa	You know what man, I am going through the same thing right now so I can totally relate to her.    My husband did the same thing to me before we got married, the only thing is the b@$t@rd didn't tell me until the kid was already almost one year old. My heart is so broken and when he blurted out the news one day, I truly knew what it felt like to have you world come crashing down around you. The "other girl" was my sister's ex-best friend too. I have never felt so many bad feelings in my life; humiliated, sad, hurt, angry, disgusted...everything you can imagine. And I am still going through all of the emotion even though we are now married.    I will never get over it, I will always be angry and I will forever hate that girl because she knew 100% that he was with me, hell she even spent a few nights at our home with my sister. It has made me an angry and aggressive person toward my husband, I will always resent him for the kind of negative person he turned me into. BUT, he knew how I felt and he knew when we got married that I still am not completely over it and that I never will be, but he still chose to stay with me. That being said, he still married me and I still married him - so whatever fights or disagreements we have about the topic, we have to make it work.     Give her time, trust is always what you're given off the bat, but it only takes mere seconds to lose and years to gain back. It has been two years since I found out what he did and I still have little trust, I am slowly beginning to trust him again, but it will take a long time.     Ask her what you need to do to gain some of that trust back, I am sure she will know in time what will help. The main thing is, you need to reassure her that no matter what happens between you two that you still love her and that getting another woman pregnant will never change that!    Good luck and please message me if you need a female point of view or opinion!|`|hMavMBo4aa	She probably has a million thoughts running through her mind.  Now instead of you and her for eternity, it is you her, another woman's baby, and that other woman.  Instead of adding 1 person to her life forever, she is now adding 3.  It will probably take a while to sink it, and most of it probably won't until the baby comes.  You will have to spend a lot of time with the baby's mother during his/her infancy.  She probably was trying to fool herself before, thinking she could pretend nothing was different.  Maybe you two need some time apart.  You don't seem to be too considerate of what she is going through.  At the same time, you have a lot to deal with.  I think you should put off the wedding.|`|tlHIqvdnaa	It is awesome that she has chosen to continue to be with you and not break the pending wedding off. That is REALLY good news because it shows her tolerance level in regards to how she wants to deal with this issue, how much patience she has and how she may be willing to forgive you and move on from the initial shock, hurt, disappointment, anger, resentment and bitterness...that comes with news such as this.    What I am concerned about is how much patience will you have in allowing her to get through this situation. More than likely the reason why she hit you is out hurt/anger, however with her saying that you are not allowed to touch her again until she can trust you again...well to be quite honest, that could be a while from now because regaining trust takes a good minute. I agree that open and honest communication is the only way to get through this right now especially with a promise of  lifelong commitment just only one month away. Hopefully in time, she will learn to forgive and forget (meaning learn from the situation and not bring it up again) and hopefully you have searched within yourself to figure out why you cheated in the first place and will make a vow to not do it again. It appears you have somewhat been given a second chance, so go over and beyond to help her feel that she is the only person you want and that even though you made a mistake in stepping outside of this relationship, from this point on, she will be number one, your child number two and the mother of your child will need to be made aware that this order of priority will need to be respected and accepted...Are you up for the challenge?|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Holy cow...she seems to be acting rather weird if you ask me. If i was in that situation and I just found out my husband cheated and made somebody else pregnant, id be devestated. Are you sure she doesnt have someone on the sideline herself? She seems awefully calm for a girl who is about to get married and has just found out she was cheated on...and her future husband made that person pregnant.Something just doesnt sound right here. I would have called the marriage off. Why are you getting married if you cheat? That alone says something? I think you need to ask her if she has been with someone else, and you need to rethink the marriage, no point going into it if you cant stay faithfull. Maybe she will change about the situation once you are married-that could be hell. Get your problems out in the open now, before you both make the wrong decision and end up in divorce!!!!
wGlaCHHdaa	okay well i think its good that u have a good personality and i like that in a girl its nice.  the information that u described ur self u sound hot not trying to be a pervert or something i am just saying.  some guys don't even know what the F*** they like.    u shouldn't get down it doesn't mean ur not attractive or something    hope this helps u     by the way i am 17 years old and my height is 5'11 or 6ft(its been a while i checked my height)|`|TirUIOc3aa	hmm, well im fourteen, and that is a bit weird, maybe you don't have the greatest personality, your friends may think so, but maybe to us guys you seem, maybe a bit conceited...    im not sure what to say, other than it may be the other people, which is most likely the case, just hang in there i suppose.|`|34nEGfFPaa	Okay I am not exactly 14. I am 15.  I had the same problem looking for dates and stuff in middle school and I know I am in high school and it just seems to be my season.  It may not be your season.  Maybe you should wait it out and wait til a guy likes you.  Usually in relationship the guy fall in love first!  But if you are waiting for someone to like a dance or something ask a guy friend or go with a group of friends.  But usually either you take aggression and be the best slut you can be or wait:-)      Hope This Helps        Christian Clark|`|83yD1gsoaa	torki67@hotmail.com
p6I881Lwaa	I think looking for common interests is not always worthwhile. I mean sometimes, it's better if you don't limit yourself to one particular person just because she or he likes the same thing as you. It doesn't always work that way. I think one good way to meet people is by smiling at them and finding the right time to "connect" to one another with the same emotion and feeling when say, someone has said something that stimulates chatter and opinion among others. Let your voice be heard! And don't forget to make eye contact.
U9vE47hdaa	sitting here in the U.S. i use yahoo, but the most popular is of course myspace. which i don't have, and wouldn't use if i did have.
NBWwG299aa	-he's just not that into you Greg Behrendt  -Real Love (the truth about finding unconditional love and fulfilling relationships) Greg Baer  -Stop being the string along, A relationship guide to being the one (best book i have ever read) barbara rose  -It's called a breakup because it's broken    All of these books are REALLY good.  They have all helped me deal with different situations in relationships. I highly recommend all of them.  Trust me you won't be disappointed.
AA12392755	How about: "Would you like to go out with me sometime?"   Or if you have a specific event in mind, include that.  "Would you go to the dance with me on Saturday?"    Its not rocket science, just say what you want to do.|`|mi7cxYeMaa	Sometimes guys don't like it when a girl asks them out,  but if he's a shy guy you might want to make the first move. Good Luck!
AQ3QqA5daa	i know how you feel as this happened to me...and I have been through depression.    I feel for you and send you love!    I think what helped me intially is getting those feeling out of my head (where they went round and round and drove me NUTS!). I know it's rubbish but a councellor or a close friend or even a diary??? Sometimes when I can't sleep I write all the thoguhts down and then the next day I burn the paper and see the thoughts dissapear...sounds weird but works for me. I feel lighter seeing them fly away and watch them become nothing.    That feeling of being about to burst is what can lead to hurting yourself so I would say get the feelings out in a healthier way asap to stop going down a worse road.    As for those guys...what jerks!! Being as close as you are...get rid. Mov away from them, make/find toher friends and I found it very hard to trust toehr people and I often am defensive and a bit snappy with my new friends and I hate being that person but as they more and more accept me and shrug off my oods hey seem to get less! Funny how that works!    Good luck mate and please get in touch via email if you want to use me as a sound board or somewhere to unload your thoughts. Happy to help someone through this kind of thing as I know how upsetting it can be. Tore me up totally mate trust me so hope I helped.    xxx

First tell her you think shes really cute.  A compliment never hurts!  She might even blush.|`|NbyGRUwaaa	Dude,  Just do it.    Seriously.  There is no specific way to do it.

Now if you mean like dating then I would say ask her out to something then just ask her.|`|0JgenGPtaa	it' s best to have a chat one her one on one. find someplace where you two can talk alone.    if she's with her friends, ask her if you can have a minute or so and remember to tell her friends that you're gonna burrow her for a while so you don't seem rude.     start off with coplimenting her on her outfit or hair or something. speak from your heart;) listen to what it has to say. you have the answer, you got to search for it. Just be yourself when you talk to her and things should turn out fine.     i hope things turn out well for you and Good Luck:)|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	just go up to her say u want to ask her something in private, take her aside from her friends and just say "I've seen u around, I think ur cute, do u think we could go see a movie together sometime.."|`|xJBJn6dOaa	If you see her in the hall... stop her (or go up to her locker, or something), and ask if you call her to hang out sometime.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Say: Hey theres a movie playing that I really wanna see....do you want to come watch it with me?

EPaYoJaiaa	No, I don't think it's selfish. Any relationship (romantic or not) should be a give and take and not one person gives and the other takes they BOTH give and BOTH take. It's quite natural to want to feel wanted in a relationship and him initiating the phone call will make you feel wanted and that he's thinking of you. In my opinion his excuses are pretty lame. He's THAT lazy that he can't pick up the phone and dial some numbers? He professes his love to you yet forgets to call??? nuh-uh I don't think so. The saying is very very true actions really do speak louder than words. Talk to him again about it tell him it makes you feel unwanted. This is a small thing now but if not addressed and resolved quickly it could turn into a HUGE thing and do a LOT of damage to your relationship.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	It's kinda how guys are, but you are not being selfish at all. I'd be pissed if I were you. I went through something similar with my boyfriend, but I just stopped calling him, and eventually he caught on, and started to call me. You just gotta whip him into shape a little bit. ;] If he really loves you, he'll catch on to what he's supposed to be doing to hold up his end of the relationship.|`|hmVvpvyaaa	calling cards shouldn't be the problem, just wait until he calls you and after that you take turns,|`|W6ojHHNGaa	first of all, for the girls that are answering this question, this is a question that only man are suppose to answer. second, not all man are like that and i know because I'm not like. I have  a gf and I am the one who most of the times do the calls so i really think you should talk to him about what you feel. i hope this helps you.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Try just not calling him, if he doesnt call you then you know he doesnt care and its time to move on and find a good guy who deserves you.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	If he's admitting to being lazy, then he's lame.  How is it that he's okay when it comes to discussing what he wants to discuss, but 'lazy' when it comes to your feelings?  If anything, he's being selfish.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	If he's too lazy to call you, then he'll be lazy in person too. you sure you want to be with a guy that's too lazy to take the trash out?|`|hLSIRDtZaa	About what in particular? Selfish of what? I don't understand. Are you talking about him telling you that he loves you back? If that's what it is, then no. You are in you're right. If it's something else, you probably are wrong for this.|`|vPLCqJy9aa	Yeah we guys are like to that but to a certain extent  it's healthy in a relationship. He's starting to go overboard with it so you should call him on it and tell him you don't like it and to start acting like a normal human being and seem interested in what your talking about.|`|KgUpRQYcaa	Stop it, just stop it right now! Long distance in this case most likely means he's not really in it for you, hence no effort on his part, but in the off chance that he EVER makes it to your "part of the world" he'd mostly think of you as a booty call.|`|rqhlKKH1aa	I don't believe any man could ever be faithful for a long period of time. My bf now admitted to me that he proposed to his previous gf when he found out he was being deployed. His reason? "Just to have someone to talk to at home". I'd be VERY cautious! Maybe it's nice to keep you on a string, but beware there could be someone there occupying his time...sorry, just want you to be careful!|`|Ob7X2p4saa	I don't think wanting someone else to take the initiative in a relationship once in a while can be called selfish.|`|L5xwMx9faa	No, you're not selfish.  It sounds like he has a cheap streak.  If he cares for you as much as you for him, he would be at least splitting the phone costs.  Try not calling him, and see how long it is before he calls you.  I don't think his interest is very strong.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Let him call you next time.|`|4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	I don't think it's selfish at all.  Ask him to buy a calling card next time.  If he cares and loves you...he will.|`|2vH6VktWaa	If u dont phone him, he'll eventually call u instead.|`|CoKAaPYqaa	stop buying all the phone cards and calling him. and see if after awhle hesteps up and calls you. No not all guys are like that. I think he doesnt call you because he doesnt really feel like your around because its long distance and therefore once hes ON the phone hell express his love then. But if hes not putting any effort into it then why are you ? If a guy truely loves you and feels the way he claims he wouldnt be sayin " im lazy " or saying guys dont think like that or about stuff like that.... they do if they really care.   Think about it.  Stop putting yourself out there it seems to only get a broken heart in the end. Maybe if you stop calling so much hell think about you more and wonder what your doing and give YOU the call|`|0SQou2X9aa	hes not so into you.|`|38432188076da24bd2e484fa5d428e24aa	be a lil' pissed off

You cannot lose her because you don't have her.|`|VIRmI5ozaa	ok maybe you should cut the texting out because thats why you guys have nothing to talk about on the phone is cause you guys spend TOO MUCH TIME ON TEXTING thats why you run out of things to talk about...the person that said "what are you wearing" is stupid don't say that it's disrespectful especially if you nd her have been going out just for a few days....learn more about her ,,,favorite things,color,hobbies,sports,her history, anything that interest you
Svgru3Tnaa	I think that the girl is the second photo is obviously way prettier. She looks like she has more class. The tattoo that the first girl has on her arm isnt doing her any justice at all. I dont agree with the "friends with benefits" comment at all. I think the first girl look real rough and like she would be that way. The second girl looks like she's a girl you can bring home to meet the parents, and the first one doesnt. But thats just my opinion. If you connect more to one then thats the one you should choose. Follow your heart, and dont break hers! Best wishes and Goodluck!!|`|8t0DlWf8aa	dont upload images on the internet and show them public.is very dangerous.|`|BSaXB5VQaa	Looks are not everything.

Choose the one u care about or enjoy going out with. but if u were the kind of guy who judges people by what they look like i would choose the second one.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	... Are you serious? The second one is way prettier. You cant ask us to tell you who you're more attracted to though, thats the whole point of attraction. Its different for everyone. I just dont think that first girl is very pretty.|`|AA10202395	Honestly, I choose the first one. She may not be as attractive as the chick in the second picture but she looks like she'd be more faithful. The chick in the second photo looks like she's more into being "friends with benefits". If you're looking to just get laid, then I'd go for the girl in the second photo. But if you're looking for a relationship, then I'd go with the girl in the first one.

He may possibly abandon anti family or anti marriage people. He shall become upset at any failure to procure a certain positive future, like school or work or pursuit for professional status.....who does he think you are? and what is it about his thought idea he believes is you.
E3yOmel9aa	Insecurity is the fastest way to ruin a relationship. Just go with the flow, if it does not work out with him it will work out with someone else.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	its normal, Yes be careful. But DON'T judge other guys by your husband. Not every guy is like your husband. And you cannot take your troubles between u and ur ex into ur new relationships.|`|UzSaTblgaa	You haven't given yourself time to see if you can manage life on your own.  Moving from parents to husband and now to a new guy isn't the way to build the self esteem you need, that's why you feel insecure.  Slow things down and give yourself the time you need to mature as an adult living on your own.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	It is normal to feel this way. You are being cautious and I understand. Tell your boyfriend to be patient with you, that its something you can't help. As things go on, you will loosen up a bit, but you'll never forget.|`|WxUpNugFaa	Hi there,    It's only normal to be a bit insecure and paranoid about your partner cheating, especially if you've been with someone who has cheated before.   But look at it another way- Your new man is not your old husband. He is not the man who cheated on you.  He is a man who adores you. If you have insecurities about yourself or your appearance, try going to the gym or jogging a few mornings a week. You'll be amazed by how much sexier you feel!   If you can adore yourself, you will come across as sexier to your man and will feel more confident yourself.    Some men will always be cheaters, and that isn't woman's fault! (Same as some women are cheaters and won't change). But the main thing is NOT to bring old paranoia into new relationships, else you're already on a bad foot before you even become serious with the person. If you have genuine worries, with suggestive evidence, then do confront the person. But if its just insecurity and is unfounded in that relationship, remind yourself that he is a new guy, he cares for you and fancies you like crazy... and don't ruin it by comparing him to your ex.    Word of warning:  Men will not tolerate being 'accused' of cheating when they're not for long though, so it's best to try and deal with your insecurities.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Honestly, you should consider therapy. Not because anything is wrong with you, but being cheated on can really rock you...I know. I wish I would've had some counceling after my ex cheated on me. It would've prevented a lot of issues.  The reason its so important is because you may carry the baggage from the failed relationship into this new one, which can cause a lot of problems. You want to be free of the old feelings/issues so you're free to have a great relationship with your new BF.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Very normal. Take some time to make sure you are okay with yourself before dating again    SteveC|`|vPLCqJy9aa	My advice is to dump those guy/s and come with me i'll give you what your missing and we'll take everything slow i promise.    Leave me a message on myspace here's my URL:    www.myspace.com/martin_paz|`|MLgknFlVaa	Only time will let you get to a level of normal again. It is all about you, not the new guy. There really is no way for him to help you get over your insecurities because they are yours alone. Have you ever heard the saying "Only the one who hurts you can make the pain go away". I find that extremely true. I know you want to get over these feelings now because they are damaging to your new relationship but that just is not going to happen. You are right about needing to take it slow. After I divorced my cheating piece of crap husband I went through allot of relationships where I wound up really hurting nice guys because I really was not emotionally ready for them. My advice to you would be to work on yourself esteem through doing things to better yourself and making yourself feel good. Slowly those mistrustful feelings that come so naturally to you now will start to fade away. Just takes time. Good luck to you|`|5skL2HJxaa	I got divorced 5 years ago.  My wife cheated on me 3 times, that I know of.  Anyway.  It is hard for me to trust anyone.  I was in a relationship for 2 years.  When it came right down to it, I just didn't let it bother me.  Just because one woman cheated on me does not mean that every woman is going to cheat.  You just have to be careful, but give the guy a chance.  Try not to read into everything he does or says.  It is hard I know, but it is good that you are giving yourself the chance.  Good luck, and God bless|`|kWJkhm3gaa	Hey, well...this isn't my specialty and I'm probably not the best at advice in this area but I will give it a go:    When your ex cheated on you those times, it really hurt you.  It probably made it difficult to fully trust anyone else, especially since it happened more than once.  It seems to me like it would be very normal to question your new partner and to read into what he does.  Maybe you need to have a talk with your partner about it and tell him the facts.  Don't accuse him of anything, just tell him that what happened in the past is making you feel the way you're feeling.  If he really loves you, he'll understand.  Being honest with your partner is very important in a relationship.  This may make it easier for you to realize deep down that this new partner is a different person and needs to be given a chance of his own.  Opening up to him may lead to an important conversation that will be a big step in your process of healing.  Good luck.|`|AA12178390	1. There is no "normal" way to feel after a divorce. It is normal to feel however you feel.    2. When someone you trust cheats on you it is hard to trust anyone. Actually the hardest person to trust is yourself, you feel like you can't trust your self to see "the signs" so you overreact and think "everything is sign."    The only way to over come this is to be aware of it.     3. You need to be open with the new guy that things are this way, that you are going through a difficult emotional time. Hopefully he will be understanding of that.|`|GWmkKF5jaa	you r not alone, most women in this country feel this way.  divorce hurts the women more then it does the men.  yet, after years of abuse its the women who wants out of the relationship.    we also have a tougher time dating due to women being judged harshly by how old we are.    take a trip, and don't invite him!|`|jpTl3o5naa	Divorce is a traumatic event no matter what the problems. You must learn to trust again and yes you may get hurt again, but if you don't take a chance, you may never  find that right guy for you that will be loyal, loving and devoted. It's normal to not trust after being cheated on but we have to keep trying. Here's what I did after I got divorced after 21 years. I didn't date for over 3 years and needed to mourn the death of a marriage. I trusted again over 4 years later, got engaged and he moved in and turned out to be controlling and cruel. I ended it quickly. I went on many one time online dates, but emailed and I met the guys often before we decided to meet. I took my car and he came in his car. I went to a local restaurant that even the owner knew me, so I could feel safe. I took mental and physical notes on who they said they were, where they said they lived and other info. As I am very truthful and was looking for someone honest, this made it easier to nip things in the bud if I was lied to. If he lied, that was it. No more dates with that person. Taking notes also helped me remember things about the guys for conversation and to make them feel special that I remembered. It was a win-win situation for me. I expected some to lie and some did and some didn't and therefore I dated them again. (the honest ones) Hope this helps and I always try to give someone the benefit of the doubt first. Good luck to you and soon you willl get your confidence back. Not all men cheat and women can cheat too. Set your standards and don't back down. Also it was nerve racking to date again but you will get used to it. It takes time and patience. Be yourself but try to stay positive.  If you like your new guy and he has shown no signs for you to not trust him, then try to trust him by not asking too many questions. Just act like you would to a best friend even if this goes deeper. You got burnt badly and especially because you had little experience . He was your high school sweetheart and like you said, you married young. Hopefully this will make you stronger if you get past your ex and have learned from the experience.

2LsPtnebaa	I don't know anyone who thinks he / she HAS to have sex before he / she is married. It just happens that way.    Not everyone believes in the Bible. I'm not going to launch into a huge debate about the social stigma and demoralization of individualism associated with, pardon the pun, religiously following God's word, but suffice it to say, my best advice to say is to do what you feel is best and let others do the same. You will get yourself in a world of trouble if you walk around pushing your morals in other peoples' faces. Others don't appreciate it. No offense meant.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	thank you very much!!!!! It is NOT okay to have sex b4 marriage.!!!!! sex is not even that very important. its just that the media makes sex look so enjoyable and so important. in reality, it causes more problems than it does solve them. STD's unwanted pregnancies, etc. thats why there are so many teen pregancies today. Sex is something that should be had between 2 ppl who are IN LOVE. Its LOVEMAKING. not something you do when you're bored. and you are right. It's agaiinst the Bible. I suppose some ppl don't believe in the Bible. But I am a virgin and Proud. 20 yrs old|`|F3LBgfvwaa	People just have a hard time understanding and accepting anyone different than themselves. Fortunately, they can't dictate what we do in our personal lives. So, if you want to wait until marriage, if that's going to make you happy, then it's up to you. It's not easy being different from other people but stand your ground and you won't regret it.|`|pvuGArduaa	people are hoes now and they dont care bout the bible.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Since that is your understanding, then there is no use speaking logic|`|I9Qp0wF6aa	The question you asked it not apart of our culture it is the friends you hang around with who feel that they should before marriage.|`|66sYIR7Faa	because it is every where and people hear other people talking about how amzing it is so they anna try it.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	you dont have to but usually guys will just move along to a girl that tosses up the booty because they are too impatient to wait. thats just how they are.|`|UgcPxd4maa	because sex is a major part of a relationship. No sex or bad sex can break up a good relationship, If you sleep w/someone before you marry them, you already know what your getting into and it may help the relationship last. Besides, not everyone believes in the Bible, so.....|`|pdLOVs0eaa	nobody says you have to. more women/men than youd think appreciate someone who hasnt done it a billion times.   btw, not everyone is religious and believes in the Bible. :p|`|2ONtnHbJaa	so what if its against the bible. everyone does it and its their private life. no one needs to know about it. everyone does sins. you must be a virgin. when their ready their ready. no one is going to change their minds.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	theres nothing wrong with it if it doesn't hurt anyone....|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	probably so that they know what they're doing when they do get married.  i don't really think it's so much a matter of them thinking they 'have' to, but that they 'want' to.|`|naySyzfQaa	Some people think that, like car, a person's goodies should be test driven before he/she is brought...meaning married. In the same tone people have the saying - why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.|`|QptIPG0Maa	you don't have to.  please don't listen to that...its about what you feel right about and believe in.  i am a christian but ended up having sex before marriage- if you do please be sure it is someone you are VERY serious with and that you are in your 20s.  i regret alot of the choices i made.  i am now with the man i will marry so i feel happy being intimate with him knowing that sex is the union created for soulmates.     godbless&good luck xoxo|`|7VRtsvqyaa	clearly ur a virgin|`|JqD8in5Naa	no it isn't|`|ba3c7d6f02b9ad0508b8bba29b2f1237aa	Oh sheesh, it's against the bible. Yeah I really bet you're a 100% christian who never EVER sins... You're a hypocrite.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Because its the thing to do. Its just the way god made us.|`|xkV2rZuEaa	i dont think thatm yuk seriously.        haha i know i'm weird...not many guys eyy.        have a great day darling.|`|Rb087BsAaa	whatever.  sexual compatiability is a big part of relationship.  you want to get married not knowing what that is all about?      btw, the bible also says a virgin was pregnant.  Riiiiiiight.......|`|WWNWtzvDaa	stealing is against the bible too ..and your stealing oxygen =)|`|LgOOYyXIaa	cuz its fun  if you got the right man haahaa|`|uuHPneEcaa	People just can't wait anymore. it is against the bible to have sex before marriage. some people just think they are in love and they can't wait which makes them want to do things.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	allow me to remind you, God did not come down, write the bible, and give it to us.  God never said, "Wooooooooah, slow down kid, I don't see a ring on that girl's finger!"|`|Z54IWoClaa	Because not everyone lives by the bible. Plus people got married at like 14 in those days. Life has changed in the past 2000 years. I have no regrets about having sex before marriage. Sexual chemistry is a large part of any relationship. Going into a marriage without having sex first is like playing poker without looking at your hand. You are making a bet and a lot is riding on something you have no idea about.|`|UldvbAIWaa	sex is fun so there you go. i dont believe in that part of our culture. I personal believe in waiting until marriage.|`|3JgLRElnaa	well lol think of it this way before you buy a car you have to try it first ...|`|x88DfLokaa	i go to church.. and i know what the bible says and what it doesnt say.. but to be honest. it says alot of stuff that we should do.. like use condoms.. and bithcontrol i know it has all to do with sex.. but these days sex is everyhwere its not just soemthing that you keep to yourself anyone.. and i will admit i doint really think having sex is that big of a deal i dont go arounf always sleeping with everyone but i still tink it shoiuld be a realtionship kinda thing.. i just dont think you have to wait.. ya know.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	I dont think i HAVE to i just LIKE to :)  Its only sex i realy do not see what the big deal is. You only live once and i intend on living my life full & fun :D  Its that makes me agaisnt the bible then im well over it.    Oh and stealing, cheating, swearing... LOTS are things you are not supost to do but they get done?|`|OWcnHKXraa	well.... some guys are jerks and wnt to make sure your good in bed before you marry them. others (like me and my ex) were in crazy love and that was just how we evpressed it.|`|jNHPcyvqaa	HAHAHA at the first answer    well, not everyone has the same views, some people dont even believe in god and the bible and that, and some people think what he says is meant in a different way etc.    just cos your beliefs say you shouldn't have sex before marriage doesn't mean you shouldn't      i hate small minded people.|`|RZfWa8Braa	if you'd pay attention in biology then you might know, its just an instinct humans have to want sex, it a thing you will always want.|`|sFdn9hIkaa	because many people don't want to wait for sex so long, they are impatient.   and also, some people think the sex component in a relationship is important enough that you need to "test" it first, to see how compatible two people can be in bed.    and last but not least, the media is also manipulating many people to believe sex is utterly important...whether or not that is true, i will leave open. sex is enjoyable, period.|`|TC00nL07aa	Well simply because we are normal people. I love sex,Im not going to lie...Im not married and have and multiple partners. People who believe in the Bible can do there own thing...I do my thing by working what im good at.  Oh and probably because it makes you feel closer to that person,and it feels really really good!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I don't think you HAVE to have sex before you're married. Many people do choose to have sex before they get married, but then there are people that decide to wait until they are married. I also know that it's a big thing to do and the younger age group (16-19) think that if you don't have sex, you're crazy. But if you know what you want, that shouldn't bother you.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Marriage is a life long commitment, or it should be anyway.  Sex is a major component to a healthy marriage.  If you are not compatible sexually it will cause problems in your marriage.  So I ask you, would you marry a guy without dating him?  The point of dating is to see if you are emotionally compatible with someone.  If you are not then you dump him and move on.  So if you are weeding out someone on one major component to a healthy marriage why would you just ignore another major component?      When you go to by a car do you just look at it or do you set in it and take it for a test drive to see how it feels to drive it?  Why would you put more thought and research into buying a car then you would picking a mate?|`|37PpYx8oaa	No, you don't have to.  Any guy who says you do isn't worth your time.  Other woman will make you think you have to, because they think if they can get you to cave in, it'll make them look like less of a slut.  But it won't.  It'll only make both of you look like a slut.  Any man that tells you that just wants to get in your pants and doesn't care about you as a person, no matter what other wonderful things he's said to you.      Sex is a personal thing and only YOU can decide who you want to sleep with and when.  Never let someone else make you feel bad about your personal decision.|`|f4WVWNxuaa	You have more of an emotional connection with someone if you have slept them, it brings people closer together and makes it easier for people to properly see if they are right for each other. Going into a marriage having never slept with someone can be risky as the relationship may change after sex comes into the equation.    At the end of the day though, it is upto the people in the relationship and it could be argued that if two people are commited to each other enough to stay celebate until marriage then they are suited for each other.|`|LWvh2g2maa	We don't HAVE to.  We WANT to.  Some of us don't believe in the bible, sweety.  How about you worry about yourself and don't worry about what the rest of us are doing.  There are many different kinds of people in this world and we all believe different things, have different standards, and live different lives.  If you don't want to have sex before marriage that's your prerogative.|`|mMBzpldbaa	clearly you're a bible-bashing puritan. your sort makes me laugh :)      sex is a normal, healthy, fun activity that most couples find amazing. let me guess, you don't masturbate either do you? that's sad.       i don't think a couple should get married before finding out the other's sexual needs, and the only way to do that is to have sex. you wouldn't buy a car without test driving it would you? what if you got married to someone and later found yourselves to be sexually incompatible?      it's a horrible thought. my boyfriend and i have being having sex for the past 9 months, we had sex before we were even going out and we are in love. we do not plan on getting married and you know why?      we're not sad children who need to be told what to do by a schizophrenic carpenter who died 2000 years ago... have fun in your fantasy world while i **** my boyfriend's brains out =]            oh, and we were also both below the age of consent when we first had sex with other people, have had multiple partners and don't regret one little thing. i am an adult now and you god-botherers have no right or way to tell normal people how to behave or what to do with their lives =]|`|6dB5yZbsaa	It is also a big part of our culture to get divorced.  A lot of the divorce rate is because people can not wait for what is right they just want what they want and they want it now.  If people would wait on the man and womans side they will not know what they are missing and can experiment together.  This is the way God had intended and the way that it works the best.  I am coming from having sex out of wedlock and wish I had waited for the right man.  My son is 23 years old and I am still not married.  God Bless  :)|`|Ki90Irkcaa	First of all, there were no marriage licensing back in the day. So what married people then? THE HEART. When you get married today its about making a commitment to each other, and the paper work is just proof of marriage and you claim taxes together and all that bull. And if that is important to you then cool. However, the meaning of marriage is relative to the individual. Not everyone believes the bible, verbatim. Also, Jesus/God did not write any book in the bible, so to me its second hand information (that's where faith comes in I guess)... The bible also says that there is no sin greater than another, so if you lie, you are no better than the person that has sex before marriage. So, before I would go around pointing out to people what is "against the Bible" and judging them, I would make sure that I was Jesus himself.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Do you really expect our entire culture to focus around the bible? Christianity is just one of many religions out there -- some of which also say that it's immoral to have premarital sex, some of which don't. And even religion is just one aspect of someone's life. There are lots of opinions and beliefs out there, and they all influence our culture. Christian culture is not the only way to be.    (I could go on about Victorianism and how, by trying to get rid of sexuality, they actually hypersexualized everything, but it sounds like you're more concerned about the biblical connection.)
6ELSwKKvaa	I like the shirt off but the pants down isn't sexy. It becomes sexy when I am the one controlling it. LOL However, it isn't the seeing the pants off that is sexy, it's the control I have over it. hehe|`|PFBKuVhBaa	when a guy has his shirt off thats hot  and if he has a nice build  pants off...like down to his ***?  thats nasty no matter how cute he is if hes sagging like an idiot..deal breaker|`|rZuSN2kTaa	WHAT DO YOU MEAN DOWN?

JiUwpYSXaa	how about dressing for success to get noticed.  Start wearing tight sweaters and jeans.  When they are talking about other girls, say urinate(term in Sweden) on them.  I am  just as good looking as they are and why don't notice once in awhile, Be aggressive with the boys around you and one of them will definitely notice something different about you.
h7xh61TWaa	He tries to put it in her butt. She starts to think hes gay and she pushed him to the other side. Then he comes back later and was like, "fine, no anal", so it all worked out.|`|JWYwLww3aa	He gets hit in the head and has amnesia and even though he has no idea who she is anymore, he falls in love with her all over again.

But then her boyfriend decided to suprise her and come over to her house un anounced and just opens the door because he knows he's welcome and she never locks the door. and then he just is in shocked. and then he wouldnt talk to her or answer her calls.. but she was trying to get him to know that nothing happened and she was preventing it before he makes a mistake...

What has happened since that night?    I'd ask her out if your interested in her because there is no way of knowing exactly what this little minx was thinking.|`|HKFSRxI4aa	i think you are an idiot for not making a move|`|y5P4dY7aaa	She was just trying to have fun, but you perv!|`|MPu1xuYXaa	hahaha  tht sounds like loads of fun! :D|`|PUUXbVK2aa	maybe she was under the influence.|`|DT84bcetaa	Perhaps you should post the pictures so we have a better understanding of the situation!

oUDDsVu5aa	WOW Amanda  I don't know why he is but I could only guess that he doesn't respect you because the last guy that even looked at my wife the wrong way in front of me swallowed his teeth the hard way just for disrespecting me as a man I don't even want to think what I would do to a man if he had the balls to put his hands on her in front of me as for the guy that sent you flowers well he would be eating them the hard way as well as his teeth. as for being able to take these it wouldn't matter to me if I could or not someone would have to get their A** beat in this situation but that is just me.  If I was you I would just ask him if he is scared or if he just doesn't respect and love you anymore and if you have to find someone that will because this sounds weird to me for any man to let another man do this kind of stuff to a strange woman in front of him never the less his wife and not say anything or kick the sh*t out of him.  best of luck  hope this helps  ps if he won't stand up for you then just kick the next perv that says something like that to you in the balls as hard as you can and if he is till just sitting there when you do kick him too for being a punk|`|VtTU4KcNaa	Some guys get insanely jealous when other guys so much as look at their gf/wife, some guys take it all in stride and some guys actually get a bit of an ego boost out of it.  Your husband probably sees it as harmless and likes that other guys want you but you are with him.  Don't worry, he'd probably draw the line at pimping you out.|`|RocDozwvaa	First of all its your fault to let those men touch you,maybe you like it and now that its getting out of hand you are complaining, don't only blame your hubby blame yourself, it doesn't matter how tall are you it's the way you respond to those men, and about your hubby if he would  love you he wouldn't  let that happen and treat like a ho.|`|ETFaQiTzaa	First of all--  "He won't LET you work"?  You don't need his permission to get a job.  And it's fine for some women to be house-wives, but it's much more difficult for them to separate themselves from their husbands if they're financially dependent on him.    Secondly--set ground rules, for both your husband, and your guests.  Make it -known- that no one will touch you without your permission, and if they do, defend yourself and call the police.  You gave them a fair warning, and they sound like total as*holes.  If someone gropes you, and you don't like it, there shouldn't -be- a second time.  It's sexual harassment.    And if your husband knows that this is something that really bothers you--if he sees other men objectifying and disrespecting you, and he -doesn't care-...then maybe you need to re-evaluate your marriage.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	get out of the marriage|`|AA11945637	Disrespect|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	He has no respect for you and doesnt really care about you, maybe its time to get a divorce.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Maybe he's making money behind your back.

TK CR|`|wdmp9eYXaa	your husband has no respect for you and even less respect for himself. you need to ask him why he is letting all this go on and does nothing about it. but don't expect to like the answer. he's going to let this continue because he is not going to man up and do anything about it. you need to move on with your life. normally i do not suggest divorce but in this case i am going to suggest it to you so that you are free of him and so that you can move on in your life. if you can keep a house ship shape then you are capable of getting a decent job and taking care of your self. find a small apartment, get a second hand car and find a nice decent man who will treat you like the queen that you are. i have faith in you that you can do this. but you will need to leave the area that you now live in so that these same guys can not annoy you once you are away from your husband. i know that you have to be a strong person because you have been putting up with all this for i don't know how long.

That is why,  Call the police and make an assault charge on anyone who touches you in the wrong places.  Also call the police and make a report on the creep who lives near you.  This is stalking and is against the law.  Tell your husband to get a backbone or you will leave.    If he doesn't, you are not out anything.  It will give you the freedom to find a real man. When you leave (if you do?) go to a friends house or somewhere he can't find you for a few days.  Maybe then he will wake up and be a man.|`|AGZFvag4aa	my  suggestion talk  to him let  him know  how  you  feel and  tell him what  bothers him  with out  Communication your   marriage will  fail|`|aPSDksshaa	he is no good, leave him , he is probably cheating on you and doesnt give a crap|`|WLLvMY3iaa	I am really scared for you.  When is it going to be enough?  I would not be around those men any more.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	He's either a scared weak man or a man who doesnt respect you or both.

But violence isn't the answer either.     Guy grabs you. Husband punches guy. Husband gets arrested for assault. You are now alone.     Here's a trick.

Then use it on your lazy unsupportive husband.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	im guessing that hes very shy? if this is its probably hard for him to stand up for you. he should do that though. talk to him about it, about how and why it bothers you.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	The first thing I would do is tell your husband that you don't like it, and if he doesn't protect you that when he falls asleep you are going to take it out on him what he should be doing to all those perverts and hit him with a baseball bat until he decides to be a man and protect you !  Just don't kill him just make him think your going to do it !|`|H7cNZYIYaa	sadly, you'll need to talk to him about it, we don't know what he's thinking|`|epxHCRNPaa	devorse him|`|tjbXw3p8aa	I dont think he has many feelings for you.  He could be cheating on you and thats why he doesnt care that much for you.

Why don't you punch some people in the face? It isn't your husbands job to ward off these men. Take some initiative and get it gotten'. You know? Oh, and also tell your husband it bugs you. That might help...|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	If he ain't doing nothing about it how do you know he's not asking these guys to do it to you to see what you do about it. Maybe he is testing you because he wants to see how much you really love him or he is paying these guys to do it to you and he doesn't love you because he is seeing someone else and when he gets caught we wants something to say well you where cheating on me maybe that's what he's doing you need to find out. Because that is how men are.|`|8rt7OR35aa	I think that if he knows that this bothers you, then he should do something.  I honestly think that he should do something anyways because you're his and he should be protective over you.  He doesn't sound like he cares about you all that much.    Maybe y'all should go to marriage counseling or try and talk about it.    hope your husband stops being a jerk.  :)|`|rHAiO9Ghaa	Well honey, we dont know the reasons behind this we could only take a guess. The best thing to do would to speak to your husband and share how you feel, he will open up too. He may think your ok about guys "grabbing" you and what not, so hes not saying anything about it. If you dont want to speak to your husband about it, the next time a guy trys anything like that with you speak your mind and tell him to basically p*ss off! Then your husband will probably take notice, and stand up for you. Also, this guy sending you flowers and following you home saying that on a card, is shocking! It could also be classed as stalking, so go to the police and ask to issue a restraining order keeping him back from you.    Hope this helps , Phoebe.    Need to know anything else, or even just have a chat email me phoebe.richards86@yahoo.com    xx|`|godjgAzNaa	First, you need to talk to him. Secondly, he might be waiting for you to step up and tell these guys to stop.  Do you think that you like the attention from these random guys? Just tell him how you feel about these "out of line" acts by these guys.|`|1Y95s4h3aa	Don't let anybody treat you like that, especially your husband. Your neighbor is disgusting, carry pepper spray with you everywhere. I don't know what type of places you go that men up and grab you, but it can't be good. If it is a club or bar that is to be expected. Men and women get drunk and a little too brave and do dumb things. If anybody disrepects you like that again tell a security guard or talk to the owner.  As for your husband's behavior that is no excuse. Tell him to grow some balls. Respect yourself and others. Peace.
Du8MYqwDaa	There's nothing wrong with you. You just seem like a shy girl. Most guys notice girls who are really social and friendly. The best way around being shy (if you don't like being shy) is to go out and do things (join some clubs, go to the beach with friends, hang out with more people). Talking to guys is really easy. Don't worry about how to start the conversation. You can say pretty much anything you want. Start off the conversation with something small (something you notice about them). I would say just talk to any guy you like about anything you want. After awhile, the practice starts helping you figure out what works and what doesn't.     Once you notice the guys you like, make an effort to try to hang out with them alone (some 1 on 1 time), and really get to know them. Once you're at a point where you both seem really comfortable with each other, just tell him you like him and go for it. Don't fall into the stereotype that girls shouldn't ask guys out (It really just stops you from trying to get what you want).      Trust me.....you'll definitely have a bf.....it's only a matter of time and effort.     Hope this helps|`|4azmQvmaaa	first say hi then take it from there|`|Tf19RETiaa	there is nothing wrong with you, it just takes time to find the right guy.  good luck = )|`|wMh38OzVaa	your normal.I didn't start dating till I was 24.Everybody starts dating when their ready.Don't worry you'll find somebody someday.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Nothing's wrong with you, your probably at the wrong place's to get hit on by a guy.

First of all, I'm man and I'm much older than you, but non the less, this is 2009. You are young, attractive, and fit. You have your whole life ahead of you. Next time you see a man you are attracted to, go up to him and tell him that. What's the problem? Us men have been doing this for thousands of years. So now in 2009, women still wont get off there pedestals and make a move? Come on, what's the worst they can say? No? If they say no, then so what. It's the law of averages my dear. Stop letting life pass you by cause you're too afraid to go after your own happiness. Just do it. You'll see results, I promise. Have a good day and keep your head up, but remember, no one will ever hand you anything in this life, especially in America, so go out and be aggressive, classy, and confident. You will achieve anything you wish if you just do these things. Take care.|`|X92a0EiKaa	Im sure theres a guy out there. Try just saying hi. But dont blush.

WxUpNugFaa	This is such a big question when you're young and you've never done it before, but when it comes down to it, it actually isn't such a big deal in the end.    First time experiences depend on the people involved. If your hymen has not broken, then first time sex may hurt for you and you may bleed a little bit when he enters you if he breaks it. But often it breaks at a younger age during sport etc.  If you have used a dildo/vibrator/anything like that before, you probably have already broken it too.  If the guy is rough, the first time may hurt more. Make sure you are 'wet' or use lube before he enters you, this makes it much easier and it shouldn't hurt then.  If you are not truly ready for sex, it isn;t a good idea to go through with it. If you're ready and feel comfortable with the person you're with, it will be fine.    It isn't a feeling you can describe to someone actually, but if it is good, it feels great.    Some experiences from me and my friends:  My own first time did not hurt at all, and I did not bleed. (but I've masturbated a lot since a young age). I felt completely ready for sex, and was not actually nervous at all.  One friend Mary* had so much pain the first time, she couldn't go through with it and they had to try many times.  Another friend said it hurt a little bit but wasn't too bad.  Another said he couldn't enter her, and it hurt because he was too rough. If it's your first time, tell the guy so he can be more gentle.    I have friends who are 18,19,20 and 21 who are still virgins too, so it depends on the person when you first do it :-)    If you do it, use protection. Nothing will ruin it more than ending up worrying if you're pregnant or if you've caught something...|`|2LsPtnebaa	It can be painful if you don't take it slow.

I UNDERSTAND SHE IS WORRIED ABOUT  HER LITTLE BROTHER BUT IS IT FAIR TO LET HIM LIVE THAT LIFE OF ABUSE TOO. SHE IS ALMOST 18 SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.  I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR HER, BUT IT IS NOT FAIR WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH. HER FATHER DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED.  I MEAN WHAT IF YOUR COUSIN GOES INTO A DIABETIC COMA?!
4GSONKgEaa	First, you just have got to stop making HIM the reason for whatever you decide.  If you would be uncomfortable there without him, then it only makes sense to move.    But you do have two months.  Have you written him and explained how you really feel?  Are you aware of what he is going though and why he might push you away?  OR for that matter, what any dying person goes through as they prepare to exit?  They change a lot and seeing someone through that is a big commitment.    One more thing, and i apologize if i am wrong, or if you can't entertain this idea, but i honestly have NEVER heard of any doctor giving someone 5 years to live.  He should get a second, a third and even fourth opinion and if there is ANY question that he might be lying, you need to investigate that. Doctors RARELY make these kinds of prognosis anymore.  They have found it to be a self fulfilling prophecy to tell someone how long they have to live and are quite often WRONG... VERY WRONG.     Ask to speak to his doctor maybe.  It may not be as bad as he has interpreted, OR he may have another reason to want to give you an easy out.  Either way, maybe you need to know more.    gentle thoughts...|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Nursing someone for 5 years is very painful , psychologically punishing .(experience in the family) .     If he isn't in critical health, or if he isn't going to soon end up there then I don't see why you shouldn't spend as much time with him as you can. You should tell him that you don't want children, a family right now, and that you are prepared to face this death with him, that you love him , and want to see him for as long as you can because it makes you the happiest woman in the world.    The reason he pushes you away is because if he gets fatally ill, starts loosing hair, and looks like hell it will be hard on you , embarassing for him, and he doesn't want that to happen to you. A family , kids is a life beyond you and him, its not an valid reason right now, if you clearly state that you don't want that out of life right now, that you just want to spend time with those that you love, and spend it to the fullest .    Again if he's going to be critical, you'll be little more to him than a nurse , and for 5 years that is a living nightmare, I still have problems forgetting some things ....I loved the person I am thinking of too, and ...it's not fun watching someone suffer for 5 years.     You're young yet, 4 years isn't that much . It's not that much to give to the love of your life. The only thing is if he is truly ill , you really don't want to be his nurse. The bed sores, the tubes, the hospital visits, the moans of pain, medicating him everyday, changing meds, washing him , lifting him up in bed .....it's just not right , it's just not right .|`|ygimTNzoaa	Tell him (or leave a message )you're old enough to know you want to see him through this for better or worse, it's the only thing that will make you happy. He could just be scared and he doesn't want you to 'waist' your life away with something that's inevitable. But you got to let him know if you haven't that you are running out of time and you want a strait up yes or no, if yes without hesitation you'll stay, if no you will be sad but all you'll have is your family when you leave. Say you need an answer at very least out of respect of you as a person. I guess that's all you can do. Good luck to you and I'm sorry this has happened.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	So you're basing your considerations on money alone? I mean about the apartment?     I think you should just go back to your family for now, it would be the best thing for you. He is not going to call you, unless it's with good news.|`|nI2KSsrqaa	I am so sorry, wait a couple days and than try going to see him and talk to him..If he doesnt want to talk than I am afraid the best thing to do would do your best to move on.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	I'm very sorry to hear that. Its really hard to say what you should do. I mean I dont know how far away your hometown is from where you are now, but maybe you should go back there, give him some time to get his thoughts together and try calling him once in a while. Maybe he will come around and you could go visit him and then make a plan on how you two can spend the rest of your time together. Doctors are not always right by the way. so many people are given 1 year to live and end up living 20 years. Good luck with everything.|`|AA12204338	If you truly want to stay with him then just tell him how can I leave? How?  2 years you were my bf and how lucky to have 6 weeks on an intimate level.  It's your life and I'd stay.  He's in shock and will come around and not want to go through all of this without you.  It's your call.|`|TxIDLrjOaa	First off, I am terribly sorry. Tell him that. Say: "Please, I need this and I am pretty sure you need this too. I don't care about all that I need you I won't be able to date anyone else. Let's make it the best 5 years of our life. Okay? :) I love you so much please, we've been through everything, why not this?"|`|TQRVldIFaa	go and wait outside his front door, even if it's snowing (like it was when i did this because Pigeon thort he'd messed me up) and don't move, when he finally talks to you tell him how you feel.|`|tP2NScAiaa	well i think you should try calling him once more, and if he doesnt answer, leave him a message telling him this problem.  tell him that you're gonna move back to your hometown when your lease is up in two months.  and whether he calls you back or not is whether your staying in his life ot not.  if he doesnt call you back, move to your hometown and move on with your life. thats all you can do :/  it would be a waste of time to sit around with no family or friends because you would just become depressed.    sorryyyy :[|`|NQIKCGgfaa	I am so sorry.    I would not renew the contract. I would try to make him see that you love him and would rather have him for the next five years than to lose him now.     You cannot make him do something he doesnt want to do, and while he is being selfless and acting out of his love for you, he is also disregarding your wishes to remain with him.      In your position I would not renew the lease and would tell him so. But also (if you havent convinced him of it in 2 months) would keep in touch him by ANY means after I moved to my hometown.  The reality is that at some point you DO have to let go, and I am not talking about the fatal disease but the fact that you might not convince him.     Try and try and try some more, but if you cannot budge him then tell him that you will always love him and he only needs to pick up the phone and you will go back to the town you two once shared.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	Well first thing's first, i'm sure it's bad but doctors aren't always right.  He just found out so he is obviously an emotional wreck (you too) which is normal and perfectly acceptable.  However, neither of you seem to be thinking clearly.  You could work together on helping to find him cures with alternative treatments etc. and what if he survives for 15 years?  Of course it will be hard being with him knowing his time is limited, and for that I am deeply sorry you both have to go through it.  BUT there is a bright side to everything... being with him even if it will be for a short time will make you appreciate every minute you spend with him that much more.  Call him and call him and call him until he answers, then tell him the only way he is ruining your life is by pushing you away.  Tell him your life will not be complete if you aren't with him, even for a short time.  Don't give up, he needs you and you need him.  And start looking into ways to treat himself together... you may get 20 years together!  I pray everything works out for you, good luck to you and him!|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	I am very sorry to hear this, but i say that you go to his house and talk to him. Right now he has way too much in his mind for him to handle, and can't make good decisions. Tell him that you can't just throw away your 2 year relationship because of this. That you want to be able to spend every minute that you can with him. You have coped with the inevitable, and you want to be by his side to help him go through this, to make him feel better, to help him forget.  It'll be harder on you not knowing how he is doing.|`|zPGcIbPSaa	Break ups are hard...i know your not going threw a break up but i have never lost a loved one so this is all i have to compare. Like any break up, its extremely hard to get over the loss and it takes so long; but in mostScenarios, your heart will heal. Maybe not completely but things will start to feel like they are setting into place after no time. You have to think positive. Thinking negative will only bring you down further. Though he is not returning your calls just know that he is looking out for your best interest. The more time you spend with him, the more memories and pain it will just bring to you. He is probably having a hard time too so you have to take into consideration the thoughts going threw his head when you try to talk to him. You might be hurting him by being super dramatic over the situation. Not saying you are, because I understand its really really hard..but just know he cares. Have you ever seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button?Not trying to spoil the movie if you havent seen itbut im here to help your emotions more so than caring if I ruin the movie. Well anyway, Daisy remarried after she had been in love with this man her whole life. Its possible to love again. ALSO she watched the man she loved die! He died in her arms. Yes her heart is scarred from all of itbut things heal.   We are meant to lose the ones we love, so that we learn how much they really mean to us.  But I think moving back to your hometown is a great idea! The comfort of your friends and family will take some weight off of your heart. If he calls in a month like your thinking may happen, then be a friend to him. Though you love him and its hard, he will need a friend not someone he knows he will leaving in the coming years. And I say this thinking this is what Jesus would want you to do. (Honestly) So look out for yourself and him at the same time by being his friend (if he calls you after you move) and not his lover. DEEP DEEP DEEP Inside of your heart you know whats best for you but the hard part is to talk yourself into it..so try to follow your heart the best you can! God bless you!  I hope all goes well for you.|`|lc51V6EAaa	im sooo sry but i think one of his dying wishes is for u to move on maybe u should but keep him close to u|`|JH8Afnf4aa	I'm so sorry this is happening to you. But you  need to understand that he wants the best for you and that means for you not to waste your years with a dying man.     If he doesn't answer your calls then you should go to his house/appartment and talk to him. I know this is very emotional  for you and I really hope the best for you.|`|3huALWJWaa	OMG after reading that i was crying i think you should stay with him for the time being then when it happens (sorry it sounds mean i know) go back home :'(|`|WbKu0t5taa	aww man.. i am so sorryy. I wish that i could say something to make you feel better, but i dont know what to say! I am so sorry, i would still try to call him and mabye show up at his house and talk with him, and tell him how you feel.  good luck!|`|5MZOszTJaa	You should try to move on.  It seems like you love him a lot and you would do anything for him.  respect him no matter how hard it is for you.  Move on and try to have a life while you are still young.  He knows that you want to.  If he does pass, then you know that you made him happy.   You will regret it if you don't follow one of his last wishes.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	then you should continue to be his best friend.  be there for him and don't run home because things may not work the you want.  he needs some time right to process the news he got.  he's only thinking about what's best for you and i'm sure he also doesn't want to get attached to someone only to know he won't be around for that person.  stay in town and give him some space.  send him an email or letter as a reminder that you're still his best friend and want to be there for him.  he'll push you away at first but do subtle things to let him know you're there.|`|XeuZ7j98aa	Pray pray pray(wwjd)|`|KHsWu1zbaa	He's probably very upset and doesn't want you to go along on that very painful ride, but you should just go to his house. Bring something, a home cooked meal or something to cheer him up with and tell him there's no way in hell you are leaving that house until he lets you in to talk.    Remind him that although he's sick, who knows! God has performed miracles before and if he stays strong he may beat it! who knows what sort of medical advancements they may find in the next couple of years as well?    Also why banish you from his life now? If he has 5 years left, those years should be spent together, living life to the fullest. Perhaps you guys CAN get married now and have a child and that can be his legacy to you if/when he passes on!     I would honestly sleep outside his front door and he wont have an option but to finally let you in.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	wow that is a hard decision. I would talk to him one more time about everything before making a decision at all. I would tell him what you have said here and that he is a friend foremost and has been for over two years and now we are dating and tell him you will walk away if he wants but you do not want to. Let him think about it and if he says go you need to go back home.|`|ewJMDIpLaa	wow. i don't even know what to say. first of all i'm really sorry :[  this is hard because either way you lose or wonder what would have happened.I think you should call him and tell him all of this and exactly how you are feeling. Tel him there's no way your leaving him now. If he accepts it then theres an ending as happy as it gets. if not you do need to accept it. as much as you want to fight it. unfortunately you cannot make a person accept things. call him. leave funny message. remind him why you were friends for so long. remind him why he doesnt want you to go :]|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Then don't call him as a girl friend, i would forget about calling him and just go over there stand at his door tell him that he is your friend none the less and as a friend you want to be right by his side and that you have a choice what you want to do with your life and if you want him in your life. You need him as a friend at the least so he needs ot understand that. Also this is hard for him some people just close up and shell them self's because they feel the don't deserve it. So i suggest you let him know your true feelings and that you ain't going any where but in the end this is all your choice.|`|AaGBEPMGaa	Iam reallyvsru to hear that ={|`|pGF6Xdghaa	You really need to be praying that God will heal this man..  Death is not God's will., especially at 45.  That is the enemy's plan.. not God's//  I will be in prayer that This man will be healed inJesus name..  By the stripes that Jesus bore on His back for sickness and sin, I thank God and believe that Your boyfriend will be healed..  I pray for you also that God comforts you in this diffucult situation.  Jesus came so we could be free from sickness.  Start getting in the bible and speaking scriptures over Him..   Know That When You Ask The Lord For Healing, It Is Already His Will And He Hears You And He Agrees. Know He Has Already Settled It In The Atonement Of The Blood Of Jesus Christ - He Says "Yes"!    Psalm 30:2 "O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me."    Psalm 107:19-20 "Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions."    Matthew 7:7-8 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened." NOTE - The word "ask" in the Greek has the meaning of insistent asking with a knowing of what belongs to the one making the request. Presenting a solid requisition to God, knowing He longs to distribute what He has to the one in need. Look at James 1:5-8 - we must ask in faith, and faith always knows, it never wishes!    I John 5:14-15 "Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him." NOTE - The Word of God is the will of God. If you can find it in the Word of God then you can be assured that it is the will of God. The Lord is not trying to keep healing from you, He is trying to get it to you - Just Believe!    2 Corinthians 1:20 "For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us." NOTE - Notice that according to God all of His promises towards us are "YES" and amen (so be it!) or it is settled! There aren't any "no's" from the Lord toward us when it comes to performing His Word in our behalf. - Now that's good news!    Believe These scriptures.. they are real and everday say them over your  boyfriend.  : ) may God bless you..|`|i0DBIVc9aa	This is hard for anyone. What i can say is that you ignore what he is saying and don't let him die alone, no one wants to die alone. If you love him and you are willing to stand by him no matter what then that's what you have to do. Go over there when you know he is home and just keep banging on the door. Yes he has 5 years and that's 5 long years. a lot can happen in that length of time. if both of you are up for it you can give him the gift of being a dad before its too late. that way you will always have apart of him here. You have to be up for it though, you will be a single mom and it will be tough. you have to be mentally ready, that why you have to look inside your self and figure out what will make you happy. In the end nothing matters if your not happy.|`|Tn4WQMA5aa	Man this made me cry makes my problems seem ireelevant to what you are going through .    You cant just sto ploving someone and if its him you want then be there for him tell him there isnt anybody else for you .    Remember he is only trying to save you being hurt   and its probly been a big shock for both of you.|`|EccdNc8maa	First of all.how much do you love this guy?Be sure of your feelings before you decide,A lot of sacrifices will be needed on your part same with the guy.With the findings he will undergo lots of pressure and stress,someone has to uplift his thoughts,mind and his well being.Are you ready for that??pray together that both of you be given strength and be enlightened by the challenges you are experiencing.The final decision will always be answered by you,pray for guidance.|`|pX5qsHmvaa	Go find him dont wait for his call- wait for him after work, go to his house, if he isnt going to call don't wait- he has little time to waste already!    He obviously just really cares for you and wants the best for you but you nEED to explain how much you love him and even if you were not dating you would be feeling the same as hes your best friend, so either way there is no way of avoiding the hurt and pain.     So you may as well spend the next five or more years together enjoying each other and your time.  Make the most of what you have as you never know how long either of your lives are!|`|OdMeDLmEaa	This breaks my heart. I'm sorry for the loss you feel, and I know that right now it probably feels like you are dying too. I can tell that this person loves you so much, because hes thinking of you. Try to see him face to face, even if it is just to say, "I love you, goodbye." Then if he still feels like he has to let you go, go home and let your friends and family hold you up for a while. Good luck.....|`|SbYqEeXYaa	Wow. That is awful.I would keep trying to contact him until your lease is up, and if he doesn't call back.. Move on. I know that that will be the hardest thing you would ever had to do but if he really makes it clear that he doesn't want to hurt you, respect his wishes and move on.|`|VB0OEKGraa	This is a very touchy situation. I am a Christian and when it comes to Jesus he can heal and repair anything so it's time that you go into deep prayer not only for your friend but for yourself as well. I bet right now he is extremely hurt and even though he is pushing you away it is obvious it is only being he loves you. No one wants to be alone in a time like this. I think that you should get yourself up and move back to be with your family especially if you have no one. You should calm down and get your true feelings together and write him a letter, it is the best way to get everything across without him putting his two cents in. You can explain to him how it's killing you inside to see someone you love go through this and that it will enrich your life to be there with him, you will feel like your life had purpose. This might help him to come to terms that that is why God puts people on earth, to help one another. In the mean time you can possibly stay with some family for a little while if you think he might call you back then if you need to move back you could possibly find another place to live or go stay with him. As much as it hurts it is horrible to put your life on hold. Pray about it.. write him a letter letting him know what's up.. and go be with your family. If it is meant to be it will all work out.. remember God works in mysterious ways.|`|tKq9qlgWaa	I very sorry for your boy friend,  though this is not a question to be answered over the Internet, it's a question that you must figure out and work through. The only advice I can give is go to church and prey to god for advice. If anyone could give you an answer it would be god. Good luck and I will prey for both of you
auUeI2Vnaa	It's competely fair.  Think if you were the new girlfriend and your new man said, oh sorry, I already made a date with this other girl and now I must go so I'm not rude.  That's stupid.    It's fair to the person he'd be going on a date with because otherwise he would just be wasting her time.    You're obviously too selfish to really care about whether or not he was being fair, you just wanted someone to side with you....since you weren't in a committed relationship, he can be with whoever he wants and just because he didn't choose you, doesn't mean he did anything wrong...it would have been wrong to lie to you or leave you hanging...which he didn't do.  So there is nothing wrong with what he did.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	It's the honest thing to do.    It most definitely is a bummer for you, but at least he was honest about it. Now you can move on and find someone else.|`|XT9LqOp1aa	I don't think it is rude or wrong. I would simply call up the girl and tell her I'm sorry but I am going to have to cancel our plans. When she asks why? Tell her that you don't see anything really between you two and you just want to be friends.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Fair!|`|16a8e503f5936fe72ce743511bd85df9aa	sounds like "she" Is being used for ..whatever "she" gave to him!   sounds like hes not interested!|`|vHxauOyeaa	Ouch...   Rude ... yes,   However it is probably necessary.   What is better... to break it off immediately?   Or to lead you on?     It works both ways, even if you know his intentions are not with you anymore and he went on the date with you, there is the slight possibility that you would use your woman skills to convince him that you guys had a good time and that you should keep doing it regardless of the girlfriend situation.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Wait. You had plans with a guy and he cancelled because he met someone else? Be very thankful you found out what a jerk he was before you even wasted your time on a first date.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	of course its rude, better finding out now than later.|`|0NkrNStxaa	no its fine!!|`|oadMJWOCaa	well i wasnt thinking that but i guess it is|`|f5u9sxbTaa	yes, but its  rude.  :(|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Honest, kind, and very fair!|`|Z9360MMxaa	Well look at it in a different light. Would you rather he date you while he had a girlfriend? The thing with dating is you are open to make plans with more than one person but once you enter a relationship it's only fair to see that person exclusively unless predetermined rules were set in place.|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	well just imagine your in the other girls shoes...how do you think she'd feel? probably pretty shitty! but if your the heartless type i guess i wouldnt really matter then would it|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	That is very wrong!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Ouch, that's pretty bad. lol  But hey, no one wants to date someone that does that anyway.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	Ya, that's pretty shallow.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	yeah its wrong because it is just wrong|`|a6f6a6266eb16fda348c56044f9bc982aa	Yes i would find that very rude.|`|fN23bHi0aa	NO|`|rI53kWKmaa	wait so ur lesbian?|`|NScOteNraa	that sucks im sorry.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	that's a very good reason to cancel a date.  i'm sure his new girlfriend would be really pissed if as soon as they started dating he went out on a date with another woman.|`|Pn8SATLuaa	all is fair in love and war|`|AKISdqrkaa	no its not  it happened to me  i was making out with this hot guy later on he kept on asking me to chill mean while i met this other guys which i feel very diff, too  so i stoped talking to the first guy!  its not a big deal at all!|`|UbXp2K26aa	When dating unofficially, alls fair in love and war hun, sorry to say but if you are a runner up, you can't really complain. My bf dumped a girl he was only "seeing" when he found me. and we've been together for 2 years. Sometimes you might think you like someone, but the love of your life comes around; if he's happy, let him be.|`|iZgtcAcAaa	I think it's the right thing to do - honest thing.|`|jYBgBcZGaa	It is rude but would have rather gone out on a date with him while he had a new girl friend? If I were I would forget about him. He is obviously a rude, careless guy that isn't worth a second thought|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	yea that sucks|`|AA11375099	One night it was the last one before I asked her to marry me, I had three dates lined up.  They were to meet me in a bar and the plan was I would go with the first girl that showed up.      And we "clicked" I asked her to marry me 6 weeks later.  I wonder if those other girls showed up, but I am so happy now, I could not imagine my life without her.|`|ISbCiVjGaa	No i dont think that its wrong at all, infact it would be wrong of him to go on the date when he has a gf.... Can see why he chose her over you though :)|`|IfS1VnSKaa	Yea that is rude, but being honest is the best way to go, or don't even tell her why your cancelling just tell her you have to cancel.|`|72JZHunmaa	Yeah it's rude. She shouldn't have told you that she found another person to go out with. It would have been more polite to just cancel the date|`|2xa4414maa	Ha ha, of course he's going to cancel a date if he got a steady girlfriend. It would be rude if he didn't.|`|VbyZZWM7aa	yeah because it was already planned so take her out and let her know you got a girlfriend now and ya'll can remain friends!|`|WzoJhFb9aa	No, he liked her more than you.  Maybe your date should have been sooner and he would have said that to the other girl?  hmm...|`|QWPXkq7iaa	i think it would be unfair to your actual girlfriend if you didn't cancel it...and i am sure the other girl doesn't want to waste her time.|`|repO76qoaa	Honesty is missing in relationships. It's probably better to cancel then go and not be interested in being on the date.    Sorry that it doesn't make you feel better but it's best for the long run.|`|85a3fa1820e8d16aae0d775bc9e86f25aa	I believe it is best to be up front and honest than to use lies & deceit & cheat.......but on the other hand it will probably hurt her feelings if ya c all off the date but thats better than being underhanded|`|RD4UL4l9aa	If you meet someone you think you might be interested in and make a date...  and then the next day you meet someone you KNOW you're interested in...  wouldn't going on a date with the first girl (when you know all you'll think about the whole time is the other one) be considered leading her on?      It's frustrating, I'm sure, but there are different levels of attraction...  it's not about having a back up...  and would you really want to go on a date with someone who would rather be spending time with someone else?|`|zkyFY8xYaa	I think that maybe she wasn't using u, maybe she honestly was dating you 4 you and found sumone else. And wudn't u prefer her to be honest with you then being with you to be polite but not having honest feelings for you!!  x|`|hTgnvLOSaa	No, it's not wrong.    Actually, I'd say that is a really good reason to break off a date with somebody. That's a good heads up.    Do you think it would be better if the guy went ahead on that date and the two people had a really great time together and had good chemistry then at the end of the date say: "Oh, by the way, I can't see you again because I just a got a new girlfriend. Anyway, thanks for the great time, bye!"?|`|VDlvSMP1aa	well that is a weird situation. but obviously you two didn't have that goosebumps butterflies in your stomach connection.. sorry better luck next time- men can suck. =)|`|UP33GlBwaa	Exactly.  Not very nice at all.  Hopefully I would never meet a guy like that to begin with.  I hope I can have better sense than to attract a loser like that.  I screwed up before and I just hope that I wont do that again.  It's really sad that there are people in this world that just think it's normal to hurt others, especially the ones that become their friends and try to help them.  I was in that exact situation.  I became his friend had a semi-relationship with him, got closer, believe he was trying to make a better life for himself, but come to find out, it was all a lie just to use me for my money.  It's really hard to trust anyone after that.  And I dont pity myself.  If anything I kick myself in the butt everytime I think of how stupid I was, but I also know that he (the jerk) played a major role in taking advantage of a nice girl who only saw the best in him and believed that he could overcome his troubles and start a better life for himself.  I am soo sad for him (actually more than I am for myself).  I dont think it's right to put anyone's feelings on the back burner.  Maybe the world could begin to become a better place if people would stop backstabbing each other.
f5u9sxbTaa	he either really needs help, or he likes you.  Don't get cought up in the details please!  us men are not complicated, and we are not aware of what we say/do half the time.  As the saying goes:  Women read everything from A-Z  Men read everything from A-B  Soooooooo yea.|`|s1h5MDz0aa	he probably likes you and just want to get to know you gradually with out rushing so you won't have to panic|`|oFTbqICiaa	if he talks to u he's interested|`|FXCoGD44aa	I don't think you're reading too much into this at all - he probably really does like you and wants to get to know you better.    The best thing you can do is just go with the flow and see what happens. Don't set any expectations or make predictions... have a completely open mind. Without expectations, you can't be let down if you are wrong or be more happily surprised if he does make a move.    So just continue talking to him and study and things will progress naturally.|`|m1IQDoUAaa	I think he really likes you!!!!! You should talk to him about your take home quiz then talk about other random stuff!!! After that be all like ill talk to you later!!!! Then maybe text him a few times!!!!
KifasiMraa	Think very carefully about why they hate each other and why you like him.  If something went down to the point where your friend hates him, he may be a real jerk in ways you don't know about yet. Usually when people break up, they can at least remember the good times and be civil to each other. If they hate each other, that worries me. Either one or both of them were jerks to each other and/or there are still feelings between the two of them. Have you noticed him do or say mean things to anyone?  Don't justify it or let it go. That could be a red flag that he's no good.     I just read that she has a bf now. That's probably a major element in his flirting wth you. He's probably flirting with you because A) he is single, lonely and knows you like him B). he knows it will piss off his ex (your friend). and C) he wants to show her that he's moved on.  usually when peopel feel the need to show their ex they have moved on, it means that they really haven't. I would distance yourself from him (don't choose a boy over a friend, especially a boy who is a jerk). Let their hatred cool down a bit.  If in a few months, you still like him and he still likes you, maybe then you can start talking to him again.  But if you jump in to something now, you'll never know if he really likes you for you, or if he's only likes you because of the reasons I stated above.|`|5hMOdHlXaa	do both|`|coFWlptOaa	You are supposed to the the OK from your friend first.|`|NScOteNraa	Don't go for it. Guys aren't worth ruining a friendship. Besides you never know if she really hates him or if she's just mad over the break up.      Sorry hun, move on.|`|72JZHunmaa	This guy probably just wants to get back at your Friend. Would you like it if your Friend went behind your back and went out with your x?|`|WAOJLC9Yaa	Okay if ur friend is a nice friend to you and has always been there for you then forget about him..  but if ur friend is not such a good friend then is not worth not being with who you like..  good luck&&hope that it helped..=]|`|7NJ8lKNEaa	you have to choose...your friend,your friendship or your feeling to that guy who hurt your friend.    Be wise...weigh between friendship or the new feeling that you have with that guy,well you already know what happened to their relationship,right?|`|AA12204338	If you really care about your friend, stop and move on.  It's not right in my opinion.  And believe it or not, if a guy hates an ex, the number one way to piss her off is to hit - or even sleep with - the ex's friend.  Provable?  Probably not but do you want to have that kind of drama?  Just seems wrong.|`|AA12178731	keep them both as your friend.......|`|8uSh2mpWaa	get the rohypnol pill silp it into his drink and the rest is up to you|`|YjJCRznTaa	What's more important, a friendship, or a guy that may dump you down the road?  Then you'll have no boyfriend and no friend either.      Dates come and go, lasting friendships do not.  Try talking to her about  it to her and see what she really thinks.|`|5Qy1qcxCaa	It depends on how much your friendship matter to you. Do you think he's the one? How do you think your friend will react?|`|CGaIacw7aa	& This girl is your best friend? Correct me if I'm wrong but best friends do not date each others ex's. If she still hated him so much why would she become sensitive when you two flirt? Hopefully you will realize that a friendship is so much more important than a 2 week fling.|`|OQF6x5CDaa	unless you dont care if you lose 1 of your best friends over a GUY-well, you already know the answer, huh?|`|0R4WGS8naa	forget about him! what is more important to you, a guy or your friend?|`|3huALWJWaa	the most important thing is friendship so i think you should listen to your friend because he might be just trying to make your mate jelous and then you will end up in tears :'(     Hope this helps|`|s0XR8cxLaa	u should give urself a chance with him and ur friend and him brokeup so she shouldnt get mad cuz they're over so if shes mad shes just jealous and shes not a good friend|`|VbyZZWM7aa	well if ya'll are friends like you say you wouldnt be a back stabber! honey sometimes a good friendship is better than a heartbreak! if i were you i would forget about him cause thats just gone make you look like a hoe! Do me a favor and dont set yourself up for failure!|`|y999LLxdaa	Forget about him!!! You cant date your friends Ex's, Think about it - you will loose your friend over this and you can never be shore what if he's flirting with you to make your friend mad?|`|vSyriws9aa	freindship is wayyyy more than just having a boy friend. stay with your friend and find someone else that your friend never dated and is a great guy.      edit: really your friend does that to you?? well that is just plain awful. but if she is your best friend i would still not date the guy.i bet your friend just does that to joke around with  you, but is a little overboard about it|`|uoMEFT4kaa	do you find this person to be a possible candidate for a long term, committed relationship?   don't just "go after him" if it is just for the fun of flirting.     it makes you look bad, and you may lose a good gal pal...over a fling.|`|ZPZQMwWdaa	forget about him!   i was in the situation once and it does not work out at all! i went for the guy and i lost my friend, like we got into this BIG fight and in the end they  got back together and now he hates me and she does too.|`|zkyFY8xYaa	he just sounds like a player!!   besides  sisters b4 misters 4ever!!|`|QBMrnfihaa	hes using you to make your friend mad, u will end up being hurt, she will end up being hurt, and he will not care!  trust me i did this with my ex wen we broke up, i got off with his best friend and it worked it really upset him which is wat i wanted, you need to be more clever than this hunny you dont want to end up being hurt|`|A3fYo8eYaa	I think you should make sure your friend is okay with it,if she says no,then tell her that you've liked boys but she's gone after them and tell her that she has another boyfriend so why not? If you like him then go for him.|`|LO2EXAgaaa	always put your chicks before d*cks|`|ygimTNzoaa	No, being with someone when your friends not OK with it WHEN it was her x-boyfriend, don't do that to her. It's like saying you weren't good enough for him but I am, even if she acts like she hates him, not right at all. Theres plenty of other people in the world not just your best friends X. You don't know if hes just playing you to make her jealous either, even still. I say don't do it unless she says it's OK.|`|3dKy0Zxjaa	if you want to keep your friendship, forget this guy. obviously it upsets your friend.|`|fN23bHi0aa	Never go after a friends ex.|`|oFTbqICiaa	friends always come first! never turn your back on a friend!    TO PROVE MY POINT:  has she always been there for you?  has she always helped you out?    now she's asking for you not to go out with him, you should listen to her. there will be other guys who like you, but friends are hard to find...|`|gOG1BOCHaa	Think of this -   Friends come before boys   And this -  Friends for ever boys whatever !
oUDDsVu5aa	It sounds like he is just trying to show you he cares and he is letting you know he wants to be there for you and you can trust him if you need to talk about it.I am sure he feels sorry for that happening to you because he don't feel you deserved what they did to you and the only way a guy can show this is to let you know he would be honored to be the one that would protect you  if you needed him to.  but mainly I think he was just trying to be there for you because he likes you and cares what you are feeling and to let you know if you ever need to open up to him he would be there for you  I am sure if he could he would cut those guys nuts off and feed them to the guys that did you that way at least that is what I would want to do to them but if I couldn't do that I would try to be there for you if you needed me if I was him. but I don't think he is thinking your weak at all but just the opposite I am sure he has a lot of respect for your strength and couldn't imagine being done the way you was him self and not be totally messed up in his own mind knowing he would want someone to just talk it out with him self and is just blown away by how strong you are so sounds to me he is just you normal guy that is letting you know he cares because that is all he can think to do after knowing what you have been through  best of luck hope this helps|`|SbiNNM3Caa	well try talking to him about it  ask him what he thinks about you( casually)  then  tell him (with no attitude) that you dont need anyone to feel sorry for you because your strong&independent  and if you want - tell him that you like him  um  hope i helped|`|Vi6As72caa	He feeling sorry for you..he can't help how he feels.
GemKt7XWaa	Just act like a parent. No big deal.|`|ocIsJXHGaa	pretend you're his boss at a job|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes, just get somebody that sounds old enought to be out of school to call and check to see what is going on!|`|uzYnw1vEaa	You could always try, I mean there's nothing they can do to you except deny you that information.    If that fails, see if you can ask one of his friends (not his best friends who may try to cover for him), or classmates|`|VppXJhCiaa	u can oretend ur his parents when u call the skool they will never know it was u calling|`|DuaaYVKWaa	You seem like a really awesome girlfriend who cares about her boyfriend ;] so sweet XDD  Maybe just that day it was too loud in the lunchroom/cafeteria to hear the phone(unless its vibrate)..  But if you really want to find out, asking one of his friends is an option, but you could also talk to your parents about it or ask an adult to help you call his school. They'll check in the Attendance and you'll be able to find out if he went to school or not.  I'm not sure if this helped but I hope you find out so you can help your boyfriend and tell him to go to school ahah! Good Luck to you guys!:D|`|TuwNKr54aa	only parents can ask that. sorry. ask one of his friends that you know. thats if you know any of his friends and see if he went to school|`|pxylBbauaa	ohhhh i know.            ASK HIM!|`|NBO4q2wQaa	ask him.... :D|`|mXtsmTdaaa	maybe you should worry about going to school and learn some spelling|`|AA12204338	Why chase around a guy that's a liar?  Why do you have the need to bust him?  Who cares? Dump him.|`|xLEiYdzXaa	ask him|`|kUsm71nnaa	You're yo young to young to have a boyfriend, date other guys have fun.
ovDqPtg8aa	haha, i talk to him every day.  i just flirt. mainly.  i'd either like stare into his eyes, smile alot, and mess with him in a good way.|`|N8TIPTDfaa	Honestly, i try to get them going a bit.     I don't see any point in making a commitment to someone unless i know both sides of them, happy, and not so happy.     i test them a bit, argue (not to seriously) with almost everything they say sometimes just to try to start a little debate.    It's a bit flirty in my own way, (the looks a give them when they say a counter-attack) but not too obvious...just in case i don't happen to like that particular side of them.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	Definitely flirt, give them lots of compliments.|`|peRwevvVaa	I flirt. Sometimes, actually all the time,  I comb my fingers through my hair. I lick my lips numerous times. But not in that playboy way.  If the guy flirts back to me. I pull my shirt down and lean towards him. If I have gum i like twirl it around my fingers, if  I have a sucker I lick it in a slow motion. Anything around me I'll put use to it and try to do a sexy position. I touch them too. Just to make them feel horny.I touch them anywhere. Hands, arms and maybe even chest.     Call me a ****, but this chick would do anything just to get the guy.|`|AA10722993	I'm way past the age of playing games.   When you get older, you will realize how stupid it is to do these things.   Be yourself from the start, and you will save yourself a lot of embarrassment.    If two people are interested in each other, they will know.  They don't have to do dumb things to get the other's attention.|`|d4b0e498d6733c28765a0910d101b027aa	It's best to flirt and leave them wanting for more..:)
CwSgBRjhaa	No, he was not kidding.  He only said that to get himself out of trouble. Dump him, he's a jerk. A person who really cares about you would not deliberately hurt your feelings.|`|N8TIPTDfaa	He meant what he said, that he thinks your boobs are small..  but he didn't mean to offend or hurt you.     Look at it this way,  let's say his penis is small and you would prefer it a bit larger...    just because he is not you're preference, doesn't mean it would affect whether you like him or not.     Everyone has preferences, he is just voicing his.   Hey, he may be into blondes, and even if you're not a blonde, it doesn't mean he's not equally as attracted to you.     I hope this helps,   guys can say lots of things and not know how to properly explain them.|`|mtUI7MACaa	34B isn't really THAT small.    It sounds like you are insecure about it, though. And he isn't helping by being insensitive.|`|2esGKO2Caa	He's a jerk leave him and tell him to take his small penis with him. Your going to find a real man.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Dump him...he's a loser.|`|4wPRkN5Saa	He probably was just joking, but if you took it offensively then he should have been sensitive to you. If he wasnt, then hes not the right one for you and he will only make an ignorant comment like that again about something else and bigger next time.|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	Honestly this guy is searching for something he thinks is better. He is trying to make you get rid of him so he don't have to go through the emotions of breaking up with you. He is a big BOOB man and when he finds them he will go after them. This is no joke. Drop him like a silicone implant.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	There are two problems here.    First, your boyfriend is an immature and insensitive ****.  That is not likely to change anytime soon, so if you can't live with this personality trait, it's time dump this guy and move on to someone else.  In your shoes I would also make it clear that you are dumping him so he can go find some dumb bimbo with DD breasts like he wants.    Second, you are way too sensitive about your breast size.  A joke is a joke, even if it was in bad taste.  Lighten up a little bit, and learn that there is nothing wrong with B cups (or A cups for that matter).  It really is a matter of personal taste, so you just need to find a guy that prefers smaller breasts over large ones.  Personally, I've dated women with A cups through DD cups, and I find the A to B cup women more shapely to suit my personal tastes.    I hope this helps.|`|QQHxHJyDaa	You say you are happy with them, and every girls worst critic is herself so you already know that its nothing to do with you.    Im guessing:  1. hes inexperienced and trying not to show it  2. he feels that you are a higher league than him and so he wants to try and balance it by saying this. Why would he make comments that imply he is into big breasts when he knows it's an issue?!   3. Or maybe it was to take attention AWAY from him naked if it was the first time you were both naked together!! The old tactic of criticising someone else before they criticise u     in any case, it was insensitive of him and he needs to know its out of order, if he is just being a jerk a similar comment about his manhood should get him where it hurts :) xx|`|d8h5h8IVaa	He sounds like a jerk, from your description I would leave him ASAP.  There are plenty of men who will like you for you, next time he says something make a comment about how his "banana" isn't as long as other "banana's" you've seen.  Monkey code, of course.|`|f6VhiYJeaa	My god the man has guts!    "dont get mad at me when i tell you the truth" is a bloody brave thing to say!    sorry, but its kind of obvious that he wants a bit more of a handful...|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	Even if he was joking, it made you uncomfortable.  Tell him his penis is small ...lets see how he likes it and then tell him you're kidding.      Then dump the jerk and find a man who likes you for who you are.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	crack a joke about his small penis, fight fire with fire if your really that upset about it, if not, then just ignore the little creep

Do that a couple of times and see if it leads to you kissing or another sign of you guys being more than friends. Text her and talk to her in school, don't be all over her too much though of course, she needs her space as well. But then just see if you match as a couple, if so be together and take it from there :)     hope it helped a little. (;|`|N8tvMoqwaa	PROFESSIONALLLLLL! Good for you! Mature and smooth!

SICKEN. ME.    p.s. he'll brag to his friends about you. stupid bitc.h    p.p.s. wanna hook up some time?|`|FZFQi97kaa	Wow, you shouldn't ask that kind of stuff. You're not that girls friend in the least bit if you're sleeping with her boyfriend.|`|anmCrowSaa	First of all, if he was really into you he would leave his girl. Second of all you shouldnt settle for being 2nd place. You should not go through with this. Never date a friends boyfriend. If he does break up with her at some point and you 2 really want to be together talk it through with your friend first.|`|OOzadIJFaa	there's no known way and it's wrong unless your bff will share him with you|`|T7qgrOJzaa	You are a horrible person. I can't believe you are so unconcerned about betraying your supposed best friend like that. Just for a little d*ck, which you could easily get somewhere else. Poor girl. Has no clue what sort of people she's surrounded herself with. Scum.|`|KTCR5XP8aa	HOLY CRAP don't do that!  You will lose your friend for what? A one night stand?  No Way! don't do it!  You should not even be thinking about crap like that.|`|DTwX5TIxaa	some bff u r|`|8b9abf4146d73b8aad5200a1598aa6b9aa	I bet you make a really good bff. lol    George Washington once said, the only way to keep a secret among 3 people is if 2 of them are dead.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	So, you don't think that she will find out?  She will, then you wont be friends anymore.  You will get a reputation as a slut and he will say you hit on him.  Is this what you want?  It is what happened to some of my classmates in high school.  No one purposefully hurts their BFF,no one!|`|PMR7RovEaa	how could you??? if i knew who you were i would walk right up to you and give you gooood, lllloooonnnggg talk about why you are such a mean person!!!! how dare you!|`|gdeoNxg4aa	My unicorn God would not approve of this, you should be a good friend and not do anything with this ''boy''.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	so you're willing to be known as the slut who betrayed her best friend.  wow, aren't you a person of bang up character.  grow up and keep your pants on. also, how much self-respect do you have for yourself that you're willing to be "the other woman."  the only woman i know who do that are insecure, have poor images of themselves and have really poor character.  sounds like you're growing up to be a great person.|`|A99uzyeFaa	And you're saying she is your "best friend forever" and you want to do that. She will find out, they always do. Don't be so cocky and think that the guy actually likes you. He is staying with hid gf because he liker HER, he wants sex from you. Don't be so blind. you are about to ruin something that cannot be replaced easily.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	you are first not a friend nor best friend and you must have really low self esteem to think its ohk to cheat on your best friend and he's not leaving her you need to get a life|`|L0Hz227xaa	Well i do not condone it becasue eventually, she will find out. But if you want to do this prepare to not be friends wither her in the long run. You have to make sure that you act like theres no attration whatever to him, and support their decisions together. Although u may be cheating, you have to never he let her suspect that there is something going on. Call him private, never call when she is with him, save his name under another number in your phone, always hang with him when no one you know is around and do not go to public places. Again i dont condone it.|`|QE06hxMGaa	Okay you just dont do that..  Ifshes ur friend i wouldnt risk the friendship or u arent true friends  And that the last thing a girl wnts to hear that she is beibg cheated on  trust me i found out that ex-bf was cheating on me by the girl he was also dating that i didnt even no you dont want to go there|`|XuEEUhd1aa	Make sure his and your phone is off when you are together  If they live together or she has a key to his place only let him come round yours  don't tell anyone else because she might find out  Good luck! x|`|SVeNYtReaa	go suck someone elses dick you ******* lying backstabber.
lXVwGgHmaa	look around your hotel or wherever your staying.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	just be friendly and open. smile and say "hi! I'm_____" don't be too vulnerable though. that's how girls get into trouble. Keep your guard up and don't automatically assume you've made a friend just because they're being friendly to you....ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A GUY. he might take advantage of your vulnerability. Don't look too desperate. Maybe this vacation will show you how to be independent and you'll see that you don't always need a huge group of friends. That's a valuable lesson in this world because you're going to be put in situations where you won't always have friends or people that you're comfortable with.
BILIAKSOaa	I don't think he is too old for you. Once it gets to about four years then he sounds too old for you. If he is hot, nice, and with in the age limit then he sounds like the perfect man (: Good luck|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Well, if you want him to go to jail the have sex with him. otherwise keep you pants on for a couple of more years.
mDuEj7Q5aa	I usually call mine hun or babe. It sounds better than baby in my opinion. :) hope i helped.|`|M11nx95paa	thing is u have to be carefully with the reason he calls u soo much by a pet name...thing is guys usually use pet nemas coz they really can't remember ur name coz there have so many other women they with ...so as not to get confused n get busted, they use pet names....but dont worry they also use them to flatter u, if they see u into that sort of thing...  my advice is just call him by his name coz its wat u r comfortable with...besides most guys don't really like petnames...|`|qpAYU8Knaa	These are really not pet names. You use these adjectives out of affection or love. Using these too soon in a relationship loses the affection out of these words and make them generic and meaningless. If you feel awkward using these but it is going to make or break your relationship then go ahead and play the game. If he feels good about hearing this coming out of your mouth then please the old man. If not then tell him the truth and he may understand.|`|FZFQi97kaa	Just tell him you're not quite comfortable with it yet, and that you would prefer to call him by his name. Or a different nick name of your choice that he agrees with.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Why are you telling us this? This needs to be communicated with your boyfriend.|`|hWpnKFi7aa	try coming up with something else that's random but cute that you can feel comfortable saying. also tell him that you don't feel right calling him that just because.|`|etMuDCQVaa	go for it, like all nicknames eventually theyll catch on and itll feel natural :)|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	this is something that you cant force :|   so try finding something that you feel comfortable with...  and explain to him how you feel|`|4pJ4y0GCaa	whatever his name is all you have to do is make a shorter name out of it :)|`|m5KqjvBOaa	something like that is hard. i can relate. but if he really wants you to call him pet names then just say it to the mirror or something until it feels like. until then you can tell him that ur not comfortable. he should understand.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	you should call him baby. try doing it when hes not paying any attention. like say your cooking say, babe do you want any of this. dont be scared or shy to do it. once you start to say it then you will get used to saying it and it wont sound weird to you.|`|U3W2AvnKaa	i know it makes me feel awkward try telling him how it makes you feel|`|xJBJn6dOaa	try something other than baby, like love or darlin'. Don't force it.. it will come naturally.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Then don't
K6K2lgW1aa	cute face! definately...    Boobs , butt are a plus if they are there|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I look for legs that are long nd have a nice shape.
1GTctcDqaa	no need for the morning after pill if you are on birth control    quite likely    Trojan    Take your pill around the same time every day    no, the pill does not stop your boobs from growing    If a condom breaks.......trust me, you will feel it.|`|nod3Ne9yaa	First off, a condom rarely breaks unless it's old or has been tampered with. if you are on the pill properly there should be no chance of pregnancy, but you are no longer protected against STDs.    The pill needs to be taken at the same time every day for maximum efficiency. You can choose for yourself when that time is. If you forget it once, you should just take it immediately, don't take a bunch in hopes that they will somehow compensate.    The pill can sometimes make your boobs grow actually, but it doesn't happen to everybody.|`|Molu004zaa	Why don't you ask a DOCTOR these things? That's what they're trained to do - answer the questions of people like you. We aren't trained professionals so the only advice you'd get here is bad advice.|`|LcOS9jjMaa	you probably would not get pregnant if you were on the pill and the condom split (i would be shocked if it did, but you should use one anyway to protect yourself from sexual transmitted infections.) condoms split if not used right, read instructions (but you never no, could happen, so go on the pill 2) durex brand is good. read instructions for pill, same time every day for 3week then take a 7day break for your period. and don't no about the boob thing, sorry!!
498JdszFaa	Why don't you use some body lotion? He'll love it.|`|OOzadIJFaa	well maybe if you dry them off with a towel first then pray they don't get sweaty again or put some baby powder on your hands then brush it off that might work if he likes them to be dry but wet is usualy better|`|WV9Wwm83aa	well get your hands wet and the water will mask the sweat|`|RISkBw1aaa	Well it won't be too gross cuz giving a handjob to him will make them sweaty either way. That happens when my gf gives me a handjob. and plus, he'll probably want you to use some kind of lubricant or at least spit so that you dont hurt him. It won't be gross, and more important for him, it won't be uncomfortably dry.|`|F7PGjUEkaa	do u know something? I can swear ur bf will like that hand-job if u do it, 'cause when ur hands r sweat it's better a hand -job because it's soft and nice. just do it and you won't regret it.     I miss a hand -job from a woman!!!!     Sorry For My English 
4GSONKgEaa	What makes you think he wouldn't "smother" you again?  Do you have some recent need to return to the familiar just now?    i have to tell you, i think reruns suck, especially when they were no good the first time.    Maybe better to ask how to forget the whole thing than how to do something so negative as ruin a relationship.  He's not married you know.  If he wanted YOU, he would be gone from her already.    gentle thoughts...|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If I were you, I would not trust want he says about the live in girlfriend.  They could be happy for all you know and he is just feeding you this crap because he knows you will fall for it.  He is cheating on his girlfriend already by just kissing you.  You should just move on, it has been two years.|`|6UUsFFnOaa	seems like u missed ur chance. ur meddling might make him change his feelings for you. but would u want him to be a cheater? than he could always possibly cheat on u. i would say let him make the choice if he wants to persue things, but it seems like the ship has sailed. theres plenty of other fish in the sea. dont get hung upp on ur ex.|`|4TWdl9mmaa	leave him alone home wrecker|`|d94d376d37270864191dbd4310431caaaa	Do nothing, be the better person.  Let him break up if he wants to.  Women can be so mean to other women by being the other woman. How would you feel if it happened to you?|`|IcxbDvpoaa	yeah, i agree..stay away home wrecker
ZF02ozgLaa	iv broken a promise,,, i mean who hasnt.... but it is really hard to gain peoples trust back.... cuz human nature thinks if youv done it once youll do it again|`|AA10992255	no its not. the truth hurts bad at first, whereas lies hurt worse because they have time to fester.|`|BZeTJHXhaa	only if could hurt the person who told me it or someone else (and nooo i'm not talkin about this "ooh i broke a nail" sentimental stuff-- i mean if like someone was going to kill someone, hurt someone, etc).     it might take a while to gain someone's trust back, and they might not want to tell you. i had a bff and she told a secret or something and it took me like forever to gain her trust back.|`|8X4Lxteeaa	it really does depend on the circumstance and how big of a promise it is. usually, and typically, NO would be the answer in my opinion. i try to never break a promise (even though it might be hard sometimes). if its a small promise and you break, it might not take too long to earn back someone's trust, but they will be cautious about promising things with you. if it's a HUGE promise, then obviously it'll take a lot longer to regain that trust. as for some circumstances when you would break a promise: say you have a depressed friend who's confided in you about her thoughts on suicide, and has made you promise not to tell anyone... i'd definately tell an adult. i think the friend would be quite ticked with me at first, but if she actually improves then in the long run breaking that promise will be worth it, and she might actually thank you for it.   so, ya. :)|`|aGaSuHLlaa	It depends for both if it is for ur friends best interest then u can break a promise but if not dont. and to earn someones trust back that can take a really long time idk if u can ever truly regain every bit of trust but u can get close.|`|AA11501437	not really - thats why i never make promises|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	trust seems to be a thing like an open heart or closed heart.  you both have to be open to give or receive trust.

7THgBSvfaa	No.. I wouldn't find it weird..|`|CHeHYwVNaa	it would be unexpected but she might be happy|`|quM6eMT6aa	no go for it just dont come out of nowhere just casually say hey wats up and compliment her and remember keep it simple and short leave her with something to think bout|`|NRldAzrpaa	No. You never get 2 know some-one if you dont talk 2 them   Be confident and smile ;)|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	yeah thats really weird.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	That is a really big deal, think and obsess ove it for hours on end, totally worth losing sleep over nd asking strangers.|`|rR5nIklWaa	no  just say hi  dont be all stalkerish tho u no|`|Rr1bh2P1aa	ya go ahead she's not going to jump to conclusions|`|uZ8bOXTqaa	as long as you don't sneak up behind her then it'll be fine =]|`|aGaSuHLlaa	no way! u should totally talk to her! I mean whats the worst that could happen?!|`|llEdx8Q2aa	Nope, that would probably interest her.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	of course not!  do it! she'll like you!|`|ebOmvMGfaa	no. that's the only way you are going to get a chance to hang out with her and to get to know her. just start out by saying hi. talk to her a little. then, eventually after a while of talking, you might get the chance to ask her out.|`|kY03DGeLaa	like as in date like? or just as a friend? .. well that doesn't really matter now does it? ... yeah Shure say hey whats up? & ask if she wants to hang out sometime or if yous wanna sit together at lunch? its perfectly normal : )     well i hope this helps .. goodluck!|`|mQdWhY2laa	No! I bet she'd love it! She's probably shy and wants an excuse to talk to you. I wish more people would just go up to others and say hi.|`|kLslWQR8aa	No don't be scared just go for it because you never know what might become of it.|`|8QJJGZY3aa	Absolutely not. She would talk to you and maybe even start to like you.|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	no not really, unless you are usally very shy.|`|Pej2G6DYaa	no that be cool like dont say hey whats up say hi i was in your class last semester my name is ...................... and she say o i r ember you hey and then sit nest to her that be great|`|3YK2dJxLaa	not really...  if i hated you, are thought you were really creepy, then i don't think i'd like it but...  but if i didn't really know you, then it be okay|`|RdmStaQGaa	you should go and talk to her! if she is nice to you start hanging out with her but if she doesnt give you the time of day than you know!|`|VfcZvAbgaa	No, thats cute.  You should definently talk to her.  Maybe just say hi and  see what she does.   Make small talk and maybe go from there.|`|bsuOclQMaa	no it wouldnt. just be like " hey wernt you in my class?"|`|QdCUbFXraa	no. it would not be weird. because its ok to just say hi to someone and then maybe get to know them a little more. then pretty soon you will probably be good friends. then u can take it from there.|`|o0tor5XPaa	Its never weird to just suddenly go up and say "hey wats up"...  Go ahead a say it, watch she will smile and say "hi" and from that you can start a conversation, it very easy, try it! :)|`|cX6POKeHaa	no, just say hi more often and you could be friends|`|i2xLDJaraa	noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would think its cool|`|i7rYRvlTaa	nope|`|gQ8yyM9Vaa	do not bother being scared you like her no big deal she probably likes you to just talk to her you to will probably end up together just take a chance explore your options|`|cG5wZOeBaa	tell her next time that she shouldn't be on the same side of the line as you and needs to be making the food in the kitchen|`|J5Mevbz7aa	she wouldn't even think anything of it man|`|T7SBu63Aaa	I'm a guy and I know that this is not weird. It's how you get her to notice you. good luck man.|`|LqwIufZVaa	not at all;  you should totally talk to her     :):):)|`|a6f8IoISaa	no, just talk to her if you like her. I think that you will regret it if you don't...|`|WcMxFsuMaa	awww do it! she'll admire your courage :)|`|9ionkBvuaa	No, that would be a great thing to say(:|`|A0oyRXEsaa	not at all.  girls want the guys to come up to them   go for it! and good luckk|`|SbIkiNd6aa	not at all! that's the best thing to do you might start talking more and get to no each other
eFXD3Qzcaa	Uh yeah!  That's horrible.  Some people are just so demented.  I read an article about a father who locked up his daughter in a basement for 24 years and she had 7 children by him!  I'm convinced that his wife knew though.  I mean, how could you not know?
3EQsrBxCaa	get counseling together before getting married.  if you really want this to work there are some things that have to be addressed together with a third party to help keep things going in a positive way.    Premarital counseling is very important for both of you right now if marriage is really where this is heading.  A controlling relationship can cause a lot of damage in the long run and since you both came from that you'll need some help there.|`|xxSGhywoaa	By nervous, what do you mean?  --skiddish when he raises a hand? (even though you know he wouldn't hit you?)  --conversation? (having to hold back what you say)  --fear of doing something wrong?    If any of these apply, I think you both together should go to a marriage councilor or psych, just so you can help each other break these walls down.  If you don't feel 100 per cent secure (even though you love him and he you) I don't suggest that you take vows.    Another suggestion is that you don't have to get married.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	It's very possible you're both still holding onto all that old baggage.  I would suggest getting some couple's counseling before you get married so that you can get all that other crap out of the way.  This is very important, otherwise you're just setting yourself up for another failed marriage.|`|BopBYwSdaa	maybe you both nervous around each other becuase BOTH try too hard to avoid conflict and confrontation in any way you both could (since divorced before)    If you both talk about marriage now.. don't worry about it... time will make this gap smaller and the walls will come down|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	If your not living together do it, before you get married. Neither one of you are comfortable about the word.

You should also make sure that your mom dosn't find out!|`|pASCPCcDaa	nope.  its healthy.  but u shouldnt be tht angry to take it out on ur penis.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	i use it as a near daily release you could say. sometimes more than once, depending on my mood.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Well, it's not bad to masturbate every day, and it's not bad to use it to release stress, but you really don't want to get anger and sex mixed up together or you could have sexual problems down the line. What I'm saying is that whatever is in your mind or in your environment when you're having sex (even with yourself) gets put together with sex in your mind. So, if you listen to a particular song then when you hear it next time you might get turned on (think of Pavlov and his dogs). So, if you're always having sex (or masturbating) when you're angry then you may find that someday you HAVE to be angry to have sex. See what I mean? That's an association you don't want to create. Deal with you anger another way before you have sex/masturbate.|`|Wvuj8VIHaa	masterbation is very good to release stress keep going|`|M9wcO2lxaa	nope its better than hurting yourself or doing drugs!|`|AA11334468	Not at all    Bring it|`|qHUcyrytaa	It's normal, just don't let it consume your entire day. If you are doing it too often you probably need a hobby|`|lWyux6nuaa	haha no i dont think so  i think its a big stress reliever if anything  just dont hurt yourself lol|`|A1NKGDUhaa	hahhhhhhhhhhaa|`|EdidZdtlaa	yes! yes it is. go punch a pillow kid. thats just nasty.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	If it is wrong, Im screwed. I do that all the time.|`|58WCrqe1aa	Choking the chicken or flicking your bean is a great way to relieve tension :D|`|MwFN3DfPaa	Its normal. I do it everyday to. And there's nothing wrong with it. Just don't let it get too out of control. you don't want to hurt yourself.|`|3ec8db48c982309c568e30839db0072eaa	its perfectly fine and natural  just dont mention it to ppl   even tho they r probably doin the same thing lol|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	sometimes yes and other times no u should go buy a dido.|`|fILk9RNYaa	Masturabation is  a form of release but doing it everyday may not be very healthy... try running or going to the gym or try a new hobby .. there are a million ways to release anger and stress.|`|5I2xl730aa	It is healthy thing to do.  You should try http://www.jackinworld.com/|`|q5DTcOuaaa	I can't masturbate when I'm stressed. Stress doesn't let me and penis concentrate. Just watch a funny video or something..  Sorry =]|`|pexxZB8Daa	no, i dont think so|`|Bi5i5cvTaa	no it isnt  it relieves stress  and sex is always better when you are angry!|`|8rLH4YNsaa	If it makes you feel good then why not? :)|`|KnaLy83Jaa	i do it.  and its better than drugs, or risks from real sex.  so basically;    hell no, that's perfectly fine!  pump on man.
n3eEOc1zaa	be proud of your saturday school [the one you got]  the other one your mom gave you was ridiculous. your right.  but hey. i'd be proud. when other people are like "i was tardy. i punched a person. i pissed off my teacher" you can be all like "yeah i saved my friends life." sounds way better.    dont let it get to you. saturday schools arnt that bad. just bring aloott of stuff to do.    you know you did the right thing, so just be fine with it. your a good friend|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	did you explain to your mother what was going on?  by all means go to the Principal and explain to him.  If she received medical treatment then she should have a receipt or note from the attending physician that can help get you off.    and if the school were the ones who called the doctor then they should have the records of who brought her in and you should remind them.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	what i'd do is give yer mom a printout of this msg & then get copies from the school txt book.|`|syWS4ep1aa	BLOODY MORONS!  You did the right thing love, get a thick glove and punch a wall!  Blasted hypocrites. Your a hero, you just ignore those bloody fools.|`|AA12071655	Explain all you want. Here's how it will go down...    Did you deliberately and knowingly skip school?   Yes  Did you inform the school the next day of the problem?  Yes  Did the school move to help the young lady in question?  Yes  Why did you wait a day to tell the school so the school could move quicker to help the young lady?    If the problem was serious enough to skip school, it was serious enough to get someone else involved so a) your friend would get help and b) you wouldn't be sitting here trying to explain why you skipped school.    Since you don't have a good excuse for that one, the bottom line is you skipped school. Put on your big girl panties and take your lumps. You are not being punished for skipping school, you are not being punished for helping your friend, you are being punished for making a poor decision. What if your friend had decided to do somethign to herself with you right there like, say, cut her own throat? Who are you, vin Diesel that you can overpower someone with a weapon? Who are you with your minimal life experience that you are qualified to treat mental illness?|`|aKb0RASbaa	You did the right thing. You should explain the situation to your principal and your Mom, I'm sure they'll understand. Also tell them the part about the Health textbook, I'd love to see how the principal reacts to that. LOL.    By the way, I hope your friend is feeling better now. I know how she feels, as I've thought about suicide after having fights with family or friends before too.|`|83r5cMh4aa	stand up for whats right and go and talk to you principal.. show him the book and explain the situation.|`|7EEOM8yJaa	that's bloody crazy so they rather you be at school and to have let ur friend commit suicide i feel you should tell them this and see what they say|`|4DEVVRlIaa	Don't listen to Terry C and Daniel C. Its a shame that they lack compassion for anyone but themselves.    Doing the right thing is never an easy thing. And those who try to monday morning quarterback your decision need to reevaluate what it means to be a good person.    Do like those who have said positive stuff and show your prinicipal the proof. Never hurts to get the media involved. Maybe the school won't want bad publicity. It wouldn't hurt to talk to your mom once she has cooled down and explain again why you did what you did. Its not like you ran out and went to a wild party or anything. Or did drugs behind the school. You were being a very compassionate person and don't ever change. Helping others is a noble thing regardless of what others say. Just be careful how you go about it because there are consequences because we live in a society that is not entirely understanding.    You did good and I pray that in future you keep up the good work. Its very rare to find compassionate people. I wish you luck in your life and I hope you find a profession you like that allows you to use the god given talents you have.

Good Luck!|`|a6QXFwuNaa	this is a weird answer    i say just be confident about it. if you looked good then maybe its not a bad thing after all. being artistic enough to do that isn't bad. you can say "at the time i was really interested in human form and natural beauty".    don't be embarrassed, act confidently.    but then say, "by the way, i don't want a lot of people to see these."  or something leading to them not spreading. but, uh, you cant guarantee that wont happen so id say you should just not be embarrassed.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	tell them that they are wack and ask them to show u the pic because its not there|`|0Ok61oMcaa	i would confront them about the situation, and make them pay for what they did. What they did is not normal for friends to do. I would let them know how you feel about this!|`|GxLpWJZNaa	if they are really your friends they wouldn't say anything to other people. so, i think they are not a true friends, i think you should just stop talking to them, or find a really emberasing secret about them and tell them that if they keep on talking about the pictures that your going to reveal the secret to everyone.im sorry about what happened and i hope i helped and just dont let that happen again or just put it on a hidden folder.|`|wdVTFULHaa	Well, it seems that your life is over. You might as well drop out of school, and become a stripper. or you could take the porn star route.        I am kidding. I tend to do that when I have no good advice. :(    I just thought of something. What your friend did was illegal. Just so you know, here in the states, I do believe it is a felony. Someone correct me if I am wrong.
iMplzgBtaa	Go for a less expensive Asti Spumante.  I've bought ballatore in the past for about $6 or $7 a bottle, but this New Year's Eve I purchased a bottle for around $4.50 and it was just as good.  Like you said you'll pay less when buying in bulk.  As for the food, you may have to change the menu.  You can go with cheese, meat, veggie and fruit trays, salads, pasta salad, crackers and spread and a couple of meat choices like popcorn chicken. Buy them in bulk at the supermarket and cut them up yourself.  You can gets the trays for a couple of bucks at the dollar store or large supermarket like Wal-Mart. I've seen this at many receptions and did not think it was tacky at all.  For 100 people that might be hard to pull off though so either add more to the budget, lessen the guest list or change the food, there's really no other choices.|`|4POGapREaa	$500 for 100 people?  I'm sorry but I couldn't even buy lunch at McDonald's for that price.  You do realize that's $5 per person?  I have never heard of Ballatore but I looked it up & apparently it's like $8/bottle.  A few dozen (36 bottles) x's $8 would suck up most of your budget right there leaving you with somewhere around $2 per person to feed your guests.  You can throw a stick of celery on the plate & call it good I guess.  Just because you went to a bad reception doesn't mean you need to use that as a standard.    EDIT:  Okay I just came back to check on this question because I thought you may have been off on your figures.  Apparently, I was wrong.  You seem to have a chip on your shoulder & don't give a sh!t about your guests.  Nice.  If you're that beaten down & broke, then hold a champagne only reception.  It's extremely rude to put down your guests like they should know better than to want to eat at your event.  I'm guessing you'll be registering for gifts though, right?  Tacky tacky tacky & totally disrespectful.  I'm amazed that you even have 100 friends.  So rude.|`|G1boIrFuaa	What exactly is your question?  It seems as though you already have an idea of what you want.  Are you wanting recipes?|`|u4910BFfaa	I think you know what you want, I just question the budget.  That is $5 a person, even with snack food that will be rough to do.  Good luck though.
TKqOJGrraa	Hey! im looking for acting schools :D and im feeling pretty crap got alot of homework :(
QIQNzE11aa	It's not that they are thinking nothing. I had a ton of guy friends and learned this quite young.     It's more of the fact they weren't thinking about anything they want to talk about. Not that it's bad. But they may not want to discuss thinking they might have heard a sound in the motor... when they aren't even sure. Or about if they finished that paper or not at home. If their one bud will show up late to the golf course AGAIN, making them lose their t-off time.     They don't tend to be as chatty. Honestly, as a woman, i still don't' want to talk about half the crap i am thinking about. Just thoughts. Did i remember to put the clothes from the washer into the dryer. Did i remember to call the vendor and put in the order for our company. Which way am i going to deal with a bad rep? Harshly or with over kindness. Maybe just replaying a convo from earlier.     Mens brains aren't really that different from females. They just want to believe that's the case.     Sometimes, they really are just emptying out their minds and having a bit of a relax. They do seem to be better at that than women are.     What that sentence absolutely means in every case is this. It's nothing i want to talk about or rethink about.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	If I say Nothing then its likely one of the following:  - I wasn't paying attention to my thoughts enough to remember them  - It was negative, and I'm not dumb enough to share  - It wasn't negative but you still wouldn't like it and I'm not dumb enough to share|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	If asked that, and I was thinking about rebuilding the engine on my Arctic Cat, I don`t feel she needs to know the details..|`|f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	Usually it means that it is nothing you will find interesting or understand,  Sometimes it is nothing because we think (from experience we know) that you will not understand the concept or the reason why we are thinking about it.  Sometimes it will be embarassing to tell. And very few times, it is really nothing: as soon as you ask the question, we have forgotten what it was we were thinking off because it was not important or we were actually not thinking of anything.|`|498JdszFaa	How can you lie when you say Nothing?|`|tManvxfQaa	No...  could be they are thinking of nothing    I wish i could think of nothing...  my mind turns 24/ 7 it wont shut down...i would like to get some much needed rest..........|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I believe men when they tell me they are thinking nothing because it is true, They don't store information like we do, and most of the time, they are thinking nothing. That is why you will mostly see a blank look on their faces. It doesn't mean they are lying, they are just being guys.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	It depends on the situation.     Generally, it means precisely that..."Nothing."  It could also mean that he simply wants more time to think about the proper way to approach the situation before saying something that he cannot retract.    I hope this helps.|`|AA10986891	It could be both, I would lye if I was thinking about a hot girl I just checked out or some one else..    If I was thinking of something really dumb that would have no point discussing (work related, phone I have to make, w.e.) I would say nothing so we wouldn't have to discuss it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	it means that he's not thinking of anything important, or that he is daydreaming of something. Try not to read too much into it, people are allowed to have their personal thoughts without being nagged or tagged as being dishonest. The other point of view is that if I share every thought with my wife she won't have time to think for herself.|`|KOXcw4klaa	well as for me.it depends on the subject.sometimes i might not want to bother you with whats going through my head with something that i can deal with myself.something that has nothing to do with me and my other half.that's the way most men work.but as an honest guy,i will tell you that if it has to do with you i will let you know whats on my mind.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	95% of the time...we're actually not thinking about anything.    When we aren't doing anything....we aren't thinking about anything.     Period.    The other 5% of the time....we're thinking about having filthy, guiltless sex.     And you don't really want to hear about that.     So stop fretting.     And remember, your man is not your girlfriend. If he tells you there is nothing on his mind....it's the truth.    Good Luck!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	No....it actually means there was nothing specific on the man's mind at the time.  Unlike women, men can actually go for considerable periods of time without any profound or emotionally significant thought passing through their minds.  If you expect any sort of intelligent answer to that question, you should specify.  Ask "what are you thinking about, now, in regards to our having kids (or whatever)?"  Then, give him some time to get his head in gear on the topic.  THEN, if he doesn't want to answer you, he might say something like "Well, I really haven't thought about it," or "Oh, geez!  Why do we have to hit this topic over and over."    But, honestly, when men say they are thinking of nothing, it's usually true.|`|b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	It's just what Bill Maher said, "If we wanted you to know what we were thinking, we would be talking."    That said, I answer truthfully always.  Either I say, "I was trying to reason something out, but I'm not ready to talk about it", or  I just tell them.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	No|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey honey honey..."Real men who are not afraid to be honest?"  HAHAHHAH...Doubt you'll get a lot of answers here.  HAHHAHAH.  HAHAHAHHA.  HAHAHAHHAHA.  HAHHAHA.  We all know how they are.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	LOL This is a hoot.    It simply means nothing they feel like sharing for whatever reason.|`|CuJjdTVXaa	most of the time it means just that we are thinking of nothing at all, or if we were that it's just sort of a day dream about something stupid to fill our minds until something important comes along....hope that helps|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	it usally means we aren't thinking of anything important or something stupid that we don't want to tell you about so that you won't think that we are stupid. like ninja monkeys or something.|`|tqoZZUQJaa	Woman do this too! You just dont want to talk about it!|`|IvMPh09baa	It means he's thinking about your friend and how great she would be instead of listening to you nag him about what he's thinking.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	It means nothing. We are simple enough to walk around with our thoughts on idle.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Men:  Nothing = nothing  That's it. End of story.    Women:  Nothing = something  Nothing = many things  Nothing = everything  Which one? You should know.|`|EENUWAP7aa	I stay thinking preoccupied most of the time and rarely reveal what is going on in my mind unless I want you to know the answer is nothing.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	Since being married , I have never been approached by a woman to  ask me what am I thinking, because my actions tell them that I am  thinking only of one person, and that person is my wife.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	I don't feel like talking right now.
T1CuRwm3aa	What are you?  Stupid?  Why you care?
kDv1uC1raa	Get your money back and take it elsewhere!|`|G1boIrFuaa	Hopefully you still have your contract with this vendor.  Go through it and see what it says about when you will receive your video.  If he is in breach of contract, you can take him to small claims court and recover some of your costs.    Also, go to your local Better Business Bureau (http://www.bbb.org/) and post him on there so future brides don't have this same problem!
5DJzp6bMaa	Sure you Can Good Luck|`|2WKN9kZiaa	you can never start over... the past is the past and we are humans that dont forget... its not like we can get those neurons removed from our brain... what we can do is forgive and live with our past issues... if you both want to work things out then you will and you will dedicate the time and effort it takes to do so|`|wqchA8B7aa	Yeah, you can. It's hard to live with somebody when you're married. It's even harder when you're not! But, at least you know now that it takes a lot of work, and both people.

You will always think back to the bad and as forgiving as you may find yourself, you will get irritated with him and vice versa. I'm 19 years old and I find that we grew up and grew apart and that generally happens in young relationships. If you really want to try it, go for it but don't keep high expectations. Good luck!|`|gUdlaaGwaa	O course you can it's never to late. My fiance and I had a similar problem but it worked itself out. We fought alot over stupid things. Glad to know I'm not alone cuz I thought we were the only ones with that problem.

Of course not completely forget about but just get over it and not bring it back everytime there is an argument.     If things don't work out, don't worry it's not the end of the world.    Good Luck|`|AwAw0uiKaa	The chances of truly being able to start over are very slim, but it is possible. It requires trust in the other's ability to do it, and it requires NOT falling back on blame if the first few steps of starting over are shaky. If he makes a wrong move and you start arguing, the worst thing you can do is bring up the past. If he brings up the past, remind him of what your current efforts are and move from the topic ASAP.    My friend is currently suffering the aftermath of trying to start over with her husband, whom she divorced once and left twice. He's now obsessed with her and has trust and jealousy issues. Most people can't start over because they can't let go of what went wrong to begin with.    But it IS possible. It requires a lot of patience and support from one another. I wish you the best of luck.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	What do you have to lose by trying?  If it is going to work, your idea of living separately and going to counseling is the way to try it.  jmo|`|RqGcC13Vaa	no, its pointless|`|H0mtagXoaa	If you both want it, anything is possible... Goodluck!|`|KzVLLPsOaa	well you can start over but i think you shouldn't live together for at least a couple months until you know your ready and make sure when you have a fight not to say anything you will regret|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey...HELL YES it's possible.  Don't be afraid to put the effort in.  Be afraid to NOT put the effort in.  Keep a positive attitude.  If you're both working at the relationship, both realizing that you want the relationship to succeed enough that you're both in counseling, you both realize the mistakes you've made previously...it's all good.  You're in the best possible position for success now.  My man and I have been together 4 years now.  Our first year was VERY difficult too...we moved too fast too.  Our feelings and our love for each other has definitely took it's time in developing.  And honestly, I'm grateful for it now because it's more real now and more solid now.  You're on the right track!  Good luck to you both!|`|B3jpU4Jraa	my mom and dad had alot of bad times but it all worked out in the end if you want to build i good relationship make sure you dont spend all the time to gether try to limit it to 3 to 4 hours a day|`|0uarmMg5aa	Its never too late to make things right...if you both Truly love each other you should have no problems making it work ...|`|dCmSA6r2aa	you can never start over  you might however be able to save the relationship if both want to work hard enough for it|`|PRdDVh7Paa	i think you should give it a try and let the destiny lead ya to were it need ya to go =]|`|Xf9vSIixaa	You know they say that couples who fight a lot really love each other, that they are comfortable enough to notice one another faults and talk to them about it. Give it a go again. they also say that if you let someone you love go and it comes back it was meant to be yours. Maybe this relationship is supposed to be, you just need to work at it. In every relationship you need to work at it to make it happy and healthy. Just try. If not then move on. Good luck!|`|P2iqvxw4aa	It is definately possible for you both to work things out, as long as you both feel the same and are both willing to work on things. Sometimes we move too fast and end up fighting a lot... there's also a right way to fight and a wrong way, but your therapist should help you with that. I definately think you both can work things out if that is what you both want :) good luck!!|`|GvaaTnExaa	actually i think it can work ...if you guys truly do love each other then anything is possible....you both just have to be understanding ...you think u rushed things me and my boyfriend have been 2gether for a year ...we started dating Jan 24 2008 and i got pregnant in may 2008 ...were still together and have a good relationship and we had plenty of arguments in the beginning ...said hateful things and all ....i use to tell him i wish he was dead and he's not the father lol all types of crazy things i even tried to beat him up ...i messed his car up and all....yes ANGER can make u do crazy things.... but now he lives with me and everything has been good from this point on and i love him soo much i feel like he's the best guy i have ever been with and i hope the best for us ....but we didn't need a therapist so i dont think you guys need one ....|`|AA11785285	Try two sessions of counseling.  You both know nothing about negotiating your problems without rage and resentment.  No one taught you that you attack the PROBLEM, sweetie, not each other.    From this posting, all each of you know is how to insult the other's opinion.  And now you have experienced just how erosive that is in what you think of the other.... like slinging acid, isn't it?????????????/    Try counseling, and if it fails, you  each will now have a new skill.... how to be an adult in dealing with differences.|`|IdWS9Afiaa	Well i believe seeing i have the same problem some times. sometimes i don't let things just go and it turns in to a fight to see what i can do to make me right. you have to think about what your doing by the way you talk weather your being busy or controlling or just to worrying worrying is never good seeing it cause fights as well believe it or not. just try to forget about the bads in the relationship and spend more time with you boyfriend and try to love each other making little sacrifice here and there     ps coming from a 16 year old almost 17 hopefully you i helped.  i got problems to 3 year almost 5 year relationship|`|uvWuVWb1aa	It's never too late. When my husband and I were just dating, we took things way too fast in the first year. We were so young and got so wrapped up in the relationship that we didn't see anything else in the world. Reality his us right before our one year anniversary, and things got nasty. We started arguing constantly and I couldn't stand him. Everything he did annoyed me, and I told him I needed a break. 3 days later I realized I'd made the worse mistake of my life. I called him and let him know how big of an idiot I'd been. Things were hard because we'd both said a lot of mean, stupid things, but we eventually knew we had to let it go in order to move on. We are humans, and we all say and do stupid things. It's up to you to determine what you can forgive and forget.    Try doing new things together. It may sound cliche, but when things get to be the same everyday, it can drive you crazy which causes you to get annoyed by each other. Whether it be working out together or going to a new restaurant every week, make time to try new experiences together. It doesn't mean you have to spend a lot of money.. you can buy a game and have game night once a week. Start flirting again.. give him compliments (my husband loves when I compliment him, it brings the flirtiness back.) Don't argue over stupid things.. if he forgets the milk at the grocery store, don't make a big fuss over it. Forget about it and move on with life. It's not as hard as you think it will be.

Y3jNg93vaa	tell her that you wouldnt do that to her, that your with her and not the nurse. Some girls are really protective its really annoying, cuase one of my good guy friends went out with this one chick and she was so protective everytime we started talking she would just come up and stand next to him. But dont worry, your gf will chillax hopefully. If she doesnt trust you, then maybe you should think about the relationship some more. If one of my boyfriends were like that, and never changed i would break up with em.  (hopefully stay friends with em though) Good luck|`|rxx9ub7haa	Believe me I can get rather jealous kinda easily so just talk to her about it and wateva u do don't tell her that she's over reacting. Just look her i the eyes and repeat after me, "I understand but we've got to the stage in our relationship where we should be able to trust each other."|`|kgTqnsBIaa	nothing you can do when she gets over it emotionally she'll stop showing it physically.|`|wl85WhsTaa	lol, dumb gf and go out with the nurse...maybe you could get your new nurse gf to wear her nurse "uniform" if you know what I mean, lol|`|r8owV9esaa	good cuz guys like you who flirt annoy me.. i hope she leaves you

Tell a story that might remind him of something u may have to be the one to break the ice some guys are kind of shy.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Boys just aren't as talkative as girls. You could try to talk to him about something you know interests him and that might make it easier for him.|`|xZNVeYjZaa	The two of you may just be very nervous. If the relationship is new you guys just may be going through the awkward stages of a brand new relationship. Are you guys in your teens? Try striking up a conversation about the days events or ask him how his day went.|`|igkbUflbaa	He may be insecure or shy. Find something to talk about; movies and the weather are always good, safe conversation topics. So, why don't you two see a movie or lay together in the rain.|`|NICEuXYgaa	Talk to him.  The most important thing in a relationship is communication.  Without that there's not too much other than looks.

If so, he might be very nervous and doesn't know what to do. Start up a conversation. Ask him about the things he likes  and the things he dislikes. Find out more about him, he's probably new to this and doesn't know what to do at all. He probably does like you and is just too nervous to speak to you very often. Give it some time, get to know him very well and he will start talking to you and being a boyfriend.  Hope I helped!  ?|`|WWCfdgd0aa	ask him|`|Bz4Im62Yaa	go to a movie then talk about that|`|I2amoo6Kaa	say wanna hang some time|`|gHR1cFsiaa	how do u know he likes u?|`|rmC59Zv9aa	the more time you guys spend with each other the sooner you will become each others best freinds so then you will start talking more... it will just take time|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	How did he become your boyfriend?

c9Zohfw2aa	he's probably not sure what to do and ask his friend out if u like him although it is much easier for me to tell u probably for u to ask him out when u actually have to do it. somethings are hard and worth getting and dating is hard and sometimes u get yes's and sometimes no's. Good luck!|`|I1bAIFMXaa	He still likes you|`|zPtDq3zoaa	He doesn't hate you to say...just doesn't really know how to react...try being extra nice and seeing if you have a chance with him by reading his body language.|`|NZjnMKXAaa	You should stop looking away when you see eachother try and get to know him better and talk to him a lot become his friend!|`|A2u06IS1aa	he's probably juss really shy. (: I dont think he hates you. He might be trying to find what to say but in his head he sees that it might sound stupid in front of you. U should try and talk to him more, he might just be in love with chu!|`|Oi8Oh6zHaa	wow..i didn't catch any of that..    im guessing is that you grow some goldne balls, and just ask him to hang out. and that you need to choose one guy. no one likes sluts.|`|KzVLLPsOaa	Well i don't think he hates you i just think that he likes you but then you told him you dont like him....... that might have thrown him off|`|Xxme8O6Maa	I think he does not know where he stands with you.

Do remember, just be your sweet self.|`|qzTq9HsEaa	Erm, he talks to himself?|`|PPA30E8naa	i didnt read any of that, just ask him out|`|ErSbeRlzaa	THats what happens when mind games are played.|`|HikylB4Taa	Talk to him, that's ya'lls biggest  problem.

Then you can start concentrating on the other guy, LOL!|`|RqGcC13Vaa	SHIKABOOM BOOM BOOM!!!|`|Sy0HXSt5aa	He either doesn't feel like as getting as serious as you or he's just afraid to tell you he likes you too. So he just ignores it by not looking at you. It would make you feel a lot better if you just talked to him about it. Because the best answers will come from him not us.|`|kW371HVMaa	im confusled
LPEWAoWCaa	No I don't think you had anything to do with it, we each control our own destiny.|`|STI2L7ojaa	I'm not encouraging saying nasty things, but it would take a lot more than one arrogant little teen boy to make a girl promiscuous. One boy can't ruin your self esteem, although it certainly wouldn't encourage it.     So no, it's not your fault, but you should be careful what you say about/to people in the future.|`|9xhavdbyaa	that's odd sounding. i think you're fine.   one single guy cannot turn a girl into a  s l u t.

Good luck(:|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	he knows the risks.  there is nothing you can do or say to make him give them up.  He has to decide to give them up himself, just like any addict, otherwise he won't stay off of them permanently.|`|syWS4ep1aa	Well, it's hard to apply to an adult, but when I started smoking at 13, my brother and cousin beat the living hell out of me and burnt me with the fag. And it worked for me, I never smoked again. You could always blow smoke in watter and show him what it does to his lungs. Or just steal his cigarettes and throw them away.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	hope you never get addicted to anything since you have no understanding at all  don't throw them away it will be an ugly fight  don't harass him about them it makes it much harder to fight  just keep friendly reminders and let him be

Others not so much.|`|CFNozZM8aa	yeah.  it's like no matter how close you get you can't get close enough.  i love that feeling.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	Yes, always happened when you love that person very much. At least that's how it works with me.
Xf9vSIixaa	Just say to yourself that two weeks really isn't that long. Before you know it he will be back. Maybe to buy some time for yourself until his arrival you could throw him a Welcome Home party for when he comes back.. good luck!|`|syWS4ep1aa	Didn't that war ended ages ago? Why do you worry?

UEAdAuqbaa	What a beautiful dress!    Find green flowers (like these: http://www.fhobbit.com/Green%20Flower.JP... ) and bundle them together with pretty white ribbon and make them the centerpieces of your tables. Use them also for the flower petals your flower girl(s) toss.     Hang these everywhere  http://www.lunabazaar.com/index.asp?Page...        OR    Find a wide ribbon of a more traditional color, and tie it around your waist and use that as a base for the whole decor.|`|G1boIrFuaa	What a gorgeous color!!  I like the style of dress too.  The great thing about decorating with green is that you can mix green shades.  Its not like red or pink where you have to have an exact match.    Don't stress about getting a perfect match on everything, because you'll drive yourself crazy!  The best way to decide on green shades is to go to Home Depot, or any other homeware store, and get paint samples.  Pick out one that you think best represents the dress color, and then pick out other green shades to compliment it.  Coordinate, don't match.    Also, you should think about an accent color.  There aren't many green flowers (except the stems!), so keep that color in mind when you choose your other green shades.
5DJzp6bMaa	Breakup/get back togather|`|KOXcw4klaa	find out where things went wrong.accept the fact that maybe you were part of the breakup.its called compromise.then go from there.|`|H0mtagXoaa	Bring her roses, and then in you own words tell her how you feel! You only get a second chance once! Good luck!|`|acwVRTIqaa	i need to get back with my bf......=  (,just  do somthing really sweet, good luck|`|79AWZh1Zaa	Just be honest with yourself.  Sometimes it takes a breakup to realize what you had was something really special.  Take responsibility for your half of the mistake and if she really want to get back together, well then she will be able to take responsibility for the other half.  Be real and don't hold back any emotions.  Let her know how you really feel.|`|T2WwvJEaaa	give her time and space and if she really likes you she will come back
wzqahEqiaa	Try and find a place that will do the piercing in a sterile medical environment.  Some tattoo places are concerned about keeping everything clean.  Other places don't care about keeping things clean.  You can get diseases or infection if things aren't cleaned properly.|`|UTZC8dlHaa	Those are nasty places. For your health sake, don't do it! Your Mom is right!|`|syWS4ep1aa	Advice on the problem: Fake her signature.  Advice from me: Get real! Why the bloody hell would you want a tattoo or piercing?! Go to college!

Fsq9qvkqaa	So Sorry by Feist :]    Here are some lyrics from it:    I'm sorry  Two words I always think  After you've gone  When I realize I was acting all wrong    So selfish  Two words that could describe  Oh actions of mine  When patience is in short supply    We don't need to say goodbye  We don't need to fight and cry  Oh we, we could hold each other tight tonight
QIQNzE11aa	You have no good options. I'm sorry. You can continue to fight for social security. I'd not sell the house if you own it outright.     You are not responsible for anything to do with the car i hope? If it's his? If it isn't his, you'll have to get it back and let it go to the loan company.     You can't get a business loan if your are trying to get social security. Especially for the reasons you are claiming.     The real problem is that our country does not take care of our infirm. His medical bills are not your repsonsiblity, not being married means they can't touch you for it.     Do not get married or you'll ruin your medicaid. Tell him you'll marry him but not legally. Tell him you two can do your own little ritual and not let the world know about it. To be married by paper means little if two people mean little by it. to be married within their soul has far more meaning.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Go Back to School|`|VEwpTOROaa	go back to school|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Honest.  You need to start rebuilding your life and your good health.  Walking is free and by losing weight you may find that you will need less medicine.  Your health is your best asset.  Get it back.  The walking will also guard your mental health.  You have been through a lot, but you will survive.  You have a lot of areas to work on.  Your daughter's cutting and self-harm pretty much reflects her mental health, too.   The library is free and full of great information to help you get back on your feet financially.    Call your bank.  They will help too.  They'd rather help you than have you go belly up.  Ask your doctor if s/he has any resources at the local clinic or hospital.  Most hospitals have social workers available.    Do you have a job service center?  Maybe you can find seasonal work that will fit you health needs.  There's plenty of help out there.  You have the internet, research everything.|`|79AWZh1Zaa	Well it sounds like you need to sit down and really think this through.  I would try to put my house on the market once again.  I would also have to agree with the other responses in which they say go back to school.  I am sure you will be able to get some type of financial aid for your tuition and a little for living expenses.  Another option would be to try a temp agency, if you have not already.|`|eHoKldphaa	The answer could vary by person.It is alway a good idea to hear the suggestion from different sides and try to choose the best one.Here http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car... is a good one i recommend.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	There should have some government aid programs you can apply which should cover some basic needs.  Both you and your bf should not get married at this time until you both have jobs and health.  Do not try to sell the house or you are running the risk of become homeless.   First thing first is get to get your health back or at least enough so you can work and bring in the cash.   Again, some government job agencies might have something for you if you have not tried this route already.  If nothing else works, the you just have to do some basic labor works. Even just couple hours a day will bring enough money to cover food.   Use public transit if you need to travel.

GG6X8oFkaa	I'm in the same situation ha ha..Here's my strategy:    2 balloons, ones for valentines & 1 for her birthday.   Huge teddy bear (always works)   Chocolate or some sort of candy (Valentines)  Perfume or a Nice Outfit (Her Brithday)    The reason you should get a huge teddy bear and balloons is, women, most of the time, like to have something that shows that you care about them. On their birthday they want everybody to see & know that you love or care about them (thus flowers are great). That's why on Valentines Day, its great to get a Big Teddy Bear and Balloons.|`|7Sxh61UPaa	flowers, her favorite candy, a home-made card and jewelry|`|BMMMNnAQaa	a locket|`|g5jesOAEaa	u dont have a girlfrienid noo bhahahah|`|rxx9ub7haa	Well flowers are nice and perhaps u could get her a nice piece of jewelery it doesn't have to be expensive.

4DEVVRlIaa	You did the right thing. Keep up the good work.    As for the making it in the real world. Obviously someone has some issues to deal with.    If you spend all your time worry if the other person will do right by you, you will end up being a bitterly stressed out individual. Don't worry about the other guy and if they will do right thing. Live your life according to your personal belief's. There will always be evil people in this world. Seek out the good and not worry about the bad. They will end up doing themselves in.    And don't always expect someone to say thank you either. Doing a good deed in itself is a reward. Smile and enjoy that you did something good and continue on with your life.

You have two options and both work equally well.    1.  you always speak English to the child while your fiance always speaks French to the child.  (this WILL NOT confuse the child.  he/she will hear French coming from daddy and English from everyone else.  The child will learn both languages)    or    2.  French is only spoken in the home and English is learned from TV and the outside world and other family members.  (this is what my Greek friends are doing.  One child is 7 and he speaks both English and Greek fluently.  the other child is 3 and he speaks Greek fluently and is picking up English very fast)    since your French isn't very good, option 1 would probably be best for you.  And FWIW:  that's the way most of my neighbors have learned Spanish.  (And it's also how I've been picking up Spanish as I have several elderly neighbors who don't speak English.  My next language will prob. be Vietnamese or Chinese, as we have a large population of them as well)    as for you learning French.  check your community for language classes.  sometimes the local college will have special classes for non students.  or get a good computer program and learn and practice w/ your BF.    Also if you can find children's books in the language you want to learn, that helps adults as well.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	YES it will be very difficult and sometimes uncomfortable.    When you two are together speak french to each other.  The more you do it the better you will get.    Practice makes perfect.|`|IvMPh09baa	i married an italian from Italy with broken english.  I don't know italian but I continue to try to learn it and speak it.  Not only for the benefit of our own relationship and to show my respect and effort to get to know his language and culture, but also to communicate with his family.  Although we don't live in Italy, he still has family that lives there and doesn't speak english... and I would like to be able to have a conversation with them.    By the way... I took 2 years of french in high school, and remember some of it... but its not hard unless you  make it hard.  Do what I did, buy some language Cd's you can use while you are home and also encourage your fiance to help teach you.  Learning any language takes alot of practice, the more you repeat the words the easier it will be.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	If your son is going to learn French, then you should learn it as well.  If you two are going to stay here most of the time, then you do not have to learn it.  Then again, it would be better for you in the long run if you do.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I used Rosetta Stone because my minor in college was French, and it wasn't clicking when the teacher explained things. It's a pretty pricey product, but it really does teach you the language! I suggest doing it because you won't feel uncomfortable when you're with his family, plus you can help teach your baby.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	french is hard to learn, you just need practice a lot. you'll get it especially if your future hubby speaks it.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry but you need to learn it so when the child says something you wont be like huh?! My husband is Laos and Thai so he speaks a few languages. He has already started teaching my daughter how to speak it so I know Im learning as well. French is alot easier then what Im trying to learn. I started French in kindergarten and took it though school. Also german and spanish. I can speak a few but cant read and write them. We will teach our children all. My grandmother speaks German and spanish and my husbands family speaks english, Lao, and Thai. So yes we will teach all but I don't want my child to be able to run there mouth and say things they shouldn't say to me and me not know them. Also it really helps to know more languages. Its pretty easy if you get that Rossta Stone or something like that. Good luck!
5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We didn't have a professional one - two different people took video - a cousin, and a family friend - then they were combined into one. This was of the full ceremony, and some bits from the reception.  We did have full still photography by a professional, though.    There is nothing like having video - it's MUCH different than photographs. I think the first year we watched it every few months! After that, once a year on our anniversary.  Prices I've seen to hire a videographer, or have it as part of a photography package, are really expensive. Ask a farther away family member who isn't involved in the wedding party, or a friend - to do this for you.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I don't think I'll ever watch the video so I'm not spending the money. My brother will have his video camera so he can take some video for no cost.|`|AA11380378	I did not have one.    Who watches those things anyway?    The pictures are more than plenty IMO. We got one in every angle, every moment    Good luck|`|d463fe7e1693b502adb816944612a0e8aa	Anyone with a digital camera can do the honors, as long as they use a tripod!  Yes you will only watch it a couple of times immediately after the wedding.      However ours became the favorite 'movie' of our children for a good year and it was really funny to see their faces the first time we watched it together, they thought "Mommy and Daddy were Movie Stars before we were born!", right after the question "How come we're not there"!    It's a great souvenir but I wouldn't spend a fortune on all the movie editing, etc.  There is plenty of free software out there to do that yourself.|`|zmqN0M86aa	I'm not going to have a videographer.  I HATE watching videos of myself, I don't care if it's of my wedding.  Even if that weren't the case, I really don't see us watching it more than a couple times.  With wedding videos costing as much as they do, I feel that it's definitely not worth it.      I will add though, I'm not totally anti-videographer, it's just not for us.  Some people watch them every year for their anniversary.  If you're the type of person that likes to watch home movies a lot then I would say go for it.|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	I would advise against getting a video. After the wedding you will want to show it to everyone, but no one will really want to watch it, trust me. My parents had a film of their wedding, and they never ever watched it, but they did take out the pictures and look at them every anniversary. I'm not having a videographer.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	We didn't have one at ours, but my uncle videotaped it and I'm glad he did. I loved watching it on our 2 year anniversary. Maybe just see if a friend or family member will do it that way you don't spend more money.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I'm getting married January 2010 and did get a videographer. I like who I hired. He's different from the rest. I don't know if you'll be able to find someone like him but it doesn't hurt to try. He gives every client a personalized website, ex.www.blahandblah.com. It'll have a shortened edited verson of the wedding day. You can click on whatever link and watch what you like, ex. ceremony, photo slideshow, reception, etc. I added on a feature called barefeet. It's a personal interview with just my fiance and I. He'll ask us funny stories and how we met, and so on. The ones on his site are pretty funny.    Check out his website: www.dontgetmarriedwithoutme. The website I viewed before hiring him was www.blakeanderin.com.    Even if you can't find one like him in your area, I would still do a video. You just might look back one day and share it with your kids or grandkids. Or you can get copies for your parents.
CA9OFT4Waa	you wont have much impact on her friends unless she feels the same way towards you and is willing to get a new group of friends to be with you, how old are you two? because if its not something that you believe will last a long time, then i wouldnt even bother with it.|`|X0Igr2V7aa	Homie honestly if it wasn't meant to be I'd just let it flow.

dZxjXHA2aa	Well it stinks to lose your friendship but if it's causing you so much heartache, I wouldn't return the text.  You need to really have him out of your life, at least until you're dating someone else you're really into.    If that's not an option, just don't let yourself get sucked back in.  Remind yourself that you are a great catch and focus on finding someone who IS into you so that you can move on.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	look 4 some1 else|`|E1GcrRaTaa	You only live once- if its something you really, REALLY want, you can have it with work, and time.

The only bad thing is having to worry about bills and money.  When you move out you definitely realize how much you took living at your parents house for granted.  But I have so much more fun living on my own, not having to worry about getting in trouble for the stupidest things.|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	i would love to move out one day|`|yJCLcFVwaa	I did it when i was 18 and i'm 60 and i've never looked back.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	I moved out at the age of 18 to go to college in another country so not only did I started to live in my own place but also at 12 hours of plane away lol  It was better than I thought, never missed mommy's cooking and whatever people say but that's because I wasn't that close to my parents anyway. I was having A LOT of pressure from them about school, not dating etc and was constantly sick (am the kind of eprson who gets really sick when under stress and still am today).The day I got my freedom I was finally living and breathing again and my health improved so much.  It might not suit some character though, I've always been independent even as a child.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	Absolutely.  well I guess I enjoy it because I've never went back to living with them since I moved out.    There are definitely some hardships that I've had to endure, but I took responsibility for it and made things better for myself. and at times ( I would never tell my parents this) I have even had to revert back to following some of the rules they forced me to follow when I lived with them.

RjpPzbBJaa	Not likely. There are many agreements  in uncontested divorces where the spouses get everything taken care of before the court date. The judge won't likely force child support, unless its clear the mother cannot take care of the children on her own.  If you have everything agreed upon, and placed in writing ready for the judge to view, signed by both spouses, its likely he/she will agree to the terms if they're fair to both parties.|`|498JdszFaa	Almost the same here, 60/40 custody (M//F).  We agreed on a shared account to transfer a monthly amount to settle our kid's charges. He pays a little more then I do. We both work.

I had the same thing happen in my divorce, all the judge will ask is if thats what you guys really want. I think you will be ok. Best wishes  BTW I live in Ga....|`|IKXZZDH9aa	The court's job when it concerns the children is to determine the best interest of the child. Georgia Family Code states that the court is to presume that it is in the best interest of the child to receive periodic support payments from the non-custodial parent.    Now, that doesn't mean that the presumptive law does not give judges wiggle room to decide otherwise, but rarely is it going to fly that no support be ordered.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	If that is what you agree on, the court will not change it. The court will only force child support if you cannot agree upon how to settle it. But, if you do not do what you say you will do, she can take you to court to force the issue.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	no they won't.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Make sure you state in your divorce papers that you  both agree to $0 child support.  This way she can't come back for back child support later when things aren't so civil.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	In the midst of a divorce that involves children, the issue of child support will be raised. How to successfully handle this dispute generally creates even more problems than it resolves. Many times the issue of child support creates disputes, as well as bitterness. How you handle it will effect how smoothly the divorce process will really be.    One very important issue to note is that in the United States, the issues of alimony, child support, as well as the division of marital assets are all separate issues. This means that if you are ordered to pay alimony and child support that is two separate payments made each month. It is not one payment, but rather both amounts added together. Also important to note is that if your spouse is awarded 50% of the marital assets you are still responsible for child support. A divorce settlement being awarded to your spouse does not release you from child support obligations.    As the divorce process continues you will discover that the primary determinant over the amount you will be paying in child support is based upon your income. This means that someone who has an income of $100,000 is going to be paying more in child support than someone who only makes $15,000 per year. This is because the courts have determined that the higher the income, the higher quality of life the child would enjoy if the parents were still together. In order to treat the child as fairly as possible the amount increases with income.    Overall, as the divorce progresses you can expect that unless you are awarded full custody that you will be paying some amount of child support. Even if you have a joint custody arrangement then it is still possible to owe child support. In a joint custody situation where it is truly, a 50/50 split the parent who makes more will owe the other parent some child support that is determined based upon the state guidelines.    Because each case is different, you will notice there is often a large difference in the amount of support orders. No two cases are exactly the same because incomes and the percentage of parenting is always going to be different. In order to know exactly what you can expect for child support in your area based upon your state's guidelines it is always wise to do research long before the child support amount is ever discussed so you can adjust your budget as necessary.
VSVQHKwKaa	He's just embarrassed.    Look, guys are fairly aggressive creatures by nature. It takes a lot of taming to get a man agreeable to civilized society.     Our sex lives are one of the last refuges where a man vents his bestial nature. Or at least, it's one of the first places where the animal in a man emerges.    So, unless that thought excites you.....that your man's deepest fantasies may be without romance, without intimacy, and may, in fact be rather brutal or even cruel.....    ...you might want to leave this one alone.    Of course...that is what the Gods told Pandora, isn't it?    The other reason might be....and I say this with all seriousness, his fantasy may be logistically impossible. If he tells you that his fantasy is to tie you and three other women up and have a fivesome in a bath tub full of lime Jello.....    ....well, that's not very sensitive or productive is it?    I don't think I'd stress this or dig too deeply.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	in some cases, you might not want to know, some men crave wild stuff that would offend you,, like a 3 some with your best friend or something to that effect and then that might lead to fights and divorce,,, best to let it go.. as long as he isn't acting on fantasies, its ok,,,, maybe he doesn't have any that you would find exciting...I personally sowed my wild oats many years ago so fantasy isn't a big thing for me... am comfortable with my wife and my life as it is right now...why mess with it ?|`|asxqampCaa	Same way you get a woman to have sex - -       STOP PESTERING THEM ABOUT IT.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Maybe he really doesn't have one.    I asked my husband a few times if he had any fantasies and he said no so i guess he doesn't cause after all these yrs i'm sure he would have told me.|`|aHjXZEzoaa	i would guess he really doesn't have one!  not everyone does have fantasies...don't push the issue!  :)|`|hs793CCxaa	Maybe he's not as sexually minded as you are. It may not be something he thinks that much about.....  Not all guys like to go at it like rabbits. Many do, but not all!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Most likely, he just doesn't have one.  Not all men have fantasies.  Consider yourself lucky that you already are his fantasy without having to do anything out of the ordinary.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Not everyone is into all the weird stuff.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	yah going down on him is something he knows you approve of, not his fantasy.  Do you really want to open that pandoras box.  Im sure it can get pretty gross and maybe he is embarassed to tell you.  I would recommend watching some porn with him and have an extremely open mind about things,  Once he feels comfortable that you are comfortable he will tell you.    He has to know you are going to trust that he is not some weird sicko freak.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Guys are afraid of being judged, sometimes.  Admitting a fantasy is sorta like admitting you have a weakness.  But, try this - get a book of erotic stories and read them together, or pick out your favorite and ask him for his.  There are great web sites of erotic fiction that would work well for something like this, too.|`|encb0jc2aa	tie him to the bed, and provide oral for him till he is about to ***, you know when, then stop and ask him, over and over again.|`|f1xaidEHaa	get him drunk then ask|`|HynN4MM1aa	I'd be willing to bet that he's afraid that once you know his deepest fantasy, you might not respect him, or you might think he's a little bit weird. We all have fantasies. Some are a little different from the garden variety. If you really want to know his deepest one, you'll have to come up with quite a whopper for yourself to get him to confide his own to you. Keep an open mind if he does open up. Good Luck!|`|vXubuAqzaa	maybe he really just dont have one* and i think he was using the fantasy for you to go down on him then was because he wanted you to do it right then and tehre lol *|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	Guys are visual creatures so you have to work that angle on him.  You might have to go into magazines or the internet to show him things & see if he likes what he's looking at, then you go from there.  For example, if you show him a picture from a Victoria's Secret catalog, check to see if he likes the outfit.  Then you can go into talking about maybe the girl in the pic or what the outfit represents (if it's a dominatrix thing, for example).   Maybe you can look at some different types of porn together & you can lead the conversation that way.  The thing you need to understand is that he DOES have fantasies & can probably get kinda wild.  He's just afraid to talk about them in fear that you'll think he's a pig or you'll think he'd want someone other than you.  Let him know that fantasies are ok & exciting.
VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,    You're not weird. Most girls...and some guys, enjoy this fantasy on some level.     The light ones just like hearing that their partner MUST have them. It's flattering.    The medium ones enjoy it when there is a little force involved...being guided or coerced. It liberates them from having to make decisions, knowing what will please their partner, or fear of rejection. Girls paticularly like this because it gives them an excuse for "unlady-like" behavior.     The heavy ones like the physical dominance of their partners. For them, being forcefully taken allows them the same thrill that people experience on a roller coaster....a loss of control and only experiencing the ride. Women enjoy this for two reasons:     a) It demonstrates the virility of their man. A man who has the guts to throw you on a bed and take you is showing you his lack of fear and his possession of you. That can be very sexy.    b) It also cuts through all the BS. Frankly, though women perfer lots of foreplay....there are times when women....just get plain HORNY. You're not looking for flowers and poetry. You're not interested in candy or forget-me-nots.    You're freaking horny and you wanted sex about 10 minutes ago and hurry up and DO ME!    And a dominant man has little trouble addressing this.    I don't think you're weird. I think your husband may be a little weird. Or, at least, I think he's fearful of "releasing the beast" as it were. He's worried you might reject him. Perhaps he once hurt a girl in bed by being too rough. It's not hard to scare girls when you're being a little brutal.     Ideas:     1. Watch a movie that involves a man...forcefully making love to a woman. Not rape. That would probably shock him. But a love scene where clothes are being ripped off rather than unbuttoned. Tell him you find it really sexy.    2. Get him into the habit of giving you bear hugs. Help him rebuild his muscles if need be. Part of his adversion maybe his fear of physical weakness (too weak to be able to actually restrain you).    3. Go out and purchase a comfortable and safe restraining device. Tell him you want to make love to him with the device on you. It'll encourage him to take control.    4. Be a little ferocious in bed yourself. Men tend to mirror their wives. If you want him to get forceful, provoke him a bit. Claw at his back. Bite his lip. Push him away...but do so in a manner that just eggs him on. Struggle slightly...and let your body relax into his affections.     5. And you can try the direct method. Next time he wants sex...just tell him "Okay...but you're only getting some if you can hold me down and TAKE IT!" Might astonish him at first....but with guys...sometimes you have to be a bit direct. We don't always pick up on subtlety.     Lots of little ways you can change his love making. Get creative and be patient.    Good Luck!|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Not at all, Your many a Mans dream Woman.|`|aXYiOskmaa	obviously your husband isn't comfortable with this. not that he thinks he'll hurt you but because it's demeaning and disrespectful. i' m sure you don't see it that way but it sounds like maybe he does. be grateful he respects you that much and let this one go.|`|RwzlaG8baa	Not weird at all. I've had a few girlfriends with the same fantasy.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	This is a common fantasy.  There are elements of control and helplessness involved.  I think it revolves around the overwhelming desirability of the woman and the brute strength of a man.  After all, when a man is so overcome with lust that he simply must possess her, who is the dominant one and who is the submissive?  It's a very sexy, erotic fantasy...and your husband shouldn't be threatened by it (though I sorta can understand his caution).  Ideally, it should be a toy to play with.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I had the same fantasy, and it took a while for my husband to open up to it. He said he couldn't ever think about doing that to me.. hurting me and such. He was also afraid I wouldn't look at him the same way and things would be weird if we did it. I couldn't get him to see that it was a fantasy and it wasn't anything bad at all. Anyway, after a few weeks of me mentioning it, we went on vacation and after a few drinks, we went back to the hotel. I had brought some things with us, and ... well.. alcohol really loosened him up! Now he's not afraid it will make things weird between us  ;)|`|L8kSyfThaa	ha ha ha ha ....first ya gotta climb that wall! AAAAAAAAAuuuuuuuu   can't seem to get the foot in the right ,    wa wa  w a{ ha ha } hole|`|uQKTFPvnaa	Why don't you try to do it to him so he understands exctly what you have in mind. That way he has a better idea and experiences what it is like to be taken like that. After you do it he might not think is weird anymore, he might actually enjoy it.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If your husband is uncomfortable with this then he probably feels that it would be disrespectful to you so you should just let it go for now.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	be careful...i had a surprise baby after that one. LOL And it is very normal indeed.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Ok, first of all- NORMAL and nothing to be ashamed of.  Second, why won't hubby try it?  Maybe you should meet in the middle.  Get a fun pair of the fur lined hand cuffs, put a little liquer in him, and get him to loosen up and have some fun with it.    Figure out how to get it combined with something he wants, spice it up for both of you.|`|hs793CCxaa	Just about everyone's fantasy sounds weird to someone else. It wouldn't need to be a fantasy if it were the norm.    You are asking him to go against everything we guys are taught NOT to do - it would take a very strong willed person to do it.     Sometimes, keeping something as a fantasy is the best way. Act it out and it may fall in a heap and make things a bit strained between you two.      I would not push it - you have asked him and he has answered you by not doing anything. Leave it at that. You could always keep the fantasy going by hoping that one day he WILL surprise you.|`|EENUWAP7aa	You asked so I will share this story with you> There's this guy I know and every year on their anniversary he dresses up like a thief all in black with a ski mask and breaks into his own house and goes up stairs in the dark. He storms the room and his wife screams and he grabs her and has sex. Then leaves the house and comes back with his clothes not dressed in Black.    His wife and him have been doing this game for years. Some people do weird things and that is one of them. Maybe you and yours should try that.
9VhR1XwOaa	True friends may let you do stupid things  They're just not supposed to let you repeat the same mistakes.   If they really are your true friends then they will have your back and look out for your well being, ya know?      Ok, so I live in NYC and this time of year it's cold and icy.  So what happened was that I had tennis practice and one of the balls fell out of the can and into the street...a street of moving traffic lol. So, I ran out on a green light to get the ball and didn't get hit because I slipped, but instead my book bag got hooked to something sticking out of the truck and it dragged me a few blocks. I was fairly bruised and broke my hand.    Ironically enough, it happened again on saturday lol. My ball rolled out into the street again. I love my balls (lol) so I, of course, ran after it. Instead of watching me risk my life again, my friends screamed "NO" and tackled me to the ground.  You see that?  True friendship    Although I was injured by the tackle anyway lol    I hope this answers your question :)
EvDmgWjvaa	That's what abuse does, yelling and calling names is mental abuse, No most family are not like this, the odd word maybe. Believe it or not mothers most times are the backbone of the family and have the great self esteem as they know things would fall apart without them.  Sit down and let your mother know it upsetting you as well and your worried about her. Talking with the person is the first step in letting them know there not alone & putting it to a stop..    good luck|`|k8socvTVaa	will it seems that ur father has anger management issues....the best way to help me is to talk to him when is calm and suggest that he seeks help...the family can also go to family therapy.....and figure out the best way to sole the issue...and yes that is abuse...is verbal abuse because his hurting ur mom mentally.|`|NQwljNOoaa	Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about your dad.  You could try to have a talk with him sometime when he is calm and tell him how you feel about how he is treating your mother with such verbal abuse as calling her names.  Your mom would develop low self esteem if your dad is constantly telling her that she can't do anything right. Maybe if you talk to your dad, he will try to control his temper better.  Tell him that he should buy a punching bag to release his anger on and stop putting your mother down when he is angry.  Talk to your mom and tell her about how great you think she is.  Tell her that she must be an extremely courageous and strong person to put up with your dad on those occasions when he gets out of control angry.  After you have talked to each separately like that, they may talk to each other about what you said to them and come up with some kind of resolution. Good luck!|`|L7QH81Uaaa	yes it is verbal and mental abuse.|`|IM9bk1YMaa	My dads pretty.. Woah    XD    He gets stressy soooo easily!!  And often he has started kicking things, slamming doors, calling me and my mom names. not really harsh ones, but he has.     xx|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	It's verbal and mental abuse. And no, a family shouldn't be this way and most are not, however I know some who are.|`|zprAkP3eaa	Itt is called mental abuse, try telling a family member and see if they can help you out.|`|ZkmFoiobaa	Yes a lot of families are like this.  Some adults are stressed after a days work and take it out on people they love, and then more often then not feel bad about what they have said or done.  Don't worry about it on your own, speak to your mum and ask her how she is feeling.  Maybe your Dad is going through something he would like to talk about. Hopefully it is just a phase.  Good luck x
0ylm04PWaa	I remember I asked my Dad about this. He said guys love the thrill of the hunt. But when the hunt is over it gets boring to place the gun back over the mantelpiece.  I think there is some truth to that statement, because even Mom agreed!|`|AA10413046	I do NOT believe only men do this.  I think it is common for people to become complacent in a long relationship.  The ladies do it too.|`|zDeFibxzaa	it is possible to take each other for granted right?yes ive seen it.when a woman tries to dog train a man it never ends up good.maybe he dont even know he is being trained,but i can garantee that when he does figure it out,he will become more untrusting of her.i know i dont like it much,lol|`|Jk9Q8Zmkaa	The same reason you're on Y/A asking why hes doing that, because it keeps your interest. You're questioning him instead of finding him boring. They still feel the same about when they first met you but don't show it as much because they know if they do you will lose interest and get bored. Nice guys never win. Its the truth|`|sDuIOUu1aa	Their humen, just like us.... sometimes us women do the same thing.|`|EENUWAP7aa	I don't treat my wife like a habit. I treat her like a Princess and she loves it.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	No one likes a prize that nags and complains.|`|tManvxfQaa	Cause 9 out of 10 are far to immature..............to know a treasure when they find one|`|RtkB46peaa	You want to know the truth, or do you just want a bunch of women to say "RIGHT ON, GIRLFRIEND!"    Men treat women differently because they are treated differently by their women.  Women go into the relationship hoping that the man will change.   Men go into the relationship praying that she won't change.    So many women get married and then start to think they can nag a man until he changes into he perfect husband.  Obviously, anyone who is nagged and complained at constantly with find themselves feeling resentful and disrespected.  That's when the man starts treating his woman like a "habit".
QIQNzE11aa	What can i say or do to make you like someone you dislike?     This is a life lesson, you cannot change other people. You cannot make someone see what you are seeing. And you may not be seeing the real him, while others do. Since love may lend you a nice pair of rose colored glasses.     If he's still treating you will 10 years down the road, then some will come around... others will not. It's not something you can change. A few of my husbands friends never liked me.... my husband eventually let them go but for more than just me as a reason. Some of his family still does not like me. None of it matters. I never asked if someone i knew didn't like him. In fact, i always have told people to keep their opinions to themself. I need no ones approval. My family would not dare to state such a thing to me. Not if they want to continue seeing me. It's a respect thing. Hate him, fine.. but be respectful because i love him. Much of that has been fixed with being married for 17 years now. Very happily married i might add. So what does it matter what others think?|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Its Not for them To accept Him the Only thing that matters Is That You Accept Him|`|uvWuVWb1aa	All you can do is talk to your family and let it go from there. It took a while for my family to like my husband. They said he was too shy and had no personality, when he was actually very outgoing but was quiet around him because of the way he was raised. In the long run, it doesn't matter what they think, as long as you are happy.|`|aXYiOskmaa	your family is nypd and fdny? perhaps this guys reputation precedes him and you family knows something you don't. many times, we are to close to someone to see the whole picture.|`|RtkB46peaa	Why would anyone choose to be with a partner who has "a really short temper & is very hot headed"?  If these qualities are known, what others aren't?    Your family and friends see him from a different perspective.  One that you can't possibly have.  While you can rightfully tell these people to mind their own business, please at least consider that they may just be looking out for your well being.  All these people care deeply about you. And while one "nay-sayer" may be unimportant in the scheme of things, the shear number of people who see this guy as a jerk certainly demands your consideration, don't you think?|`|K8OjmMUAaa	If his personality is as abrasive as it sounds, its no wonder they don't like him. I know you think the world of him, but he's honestly probably offended them at some point. "Outspoken" is SO often used as an excuse for just saying things that shouldn't be said. My sister's mother in law is the same way: She calls herself outspoken and sarcastic, but she is seriously just mean to people.     I think that you need to realize that the problem might just lie with your fiance and not your family. Think about it - you seem to be the only one out of all these people who likes him! I'm sorry, but that indicates a problem. He needs to make an effort to get their acceptance (and by the way, don't listen to the idiots that say that your acceptance is the only acceptance that matters; these people have obviously never been married), not just expect them to deal with him the way he is.     Have a talk with him. His "outspoken" tendencies are not verbal diarrhea; tell him to THINK before he says something. Ask him to please NOT make any smart@$$ remarks to your family, for YOUR sake, not theirs. You could tell him that you are used to his outspoken ways but they are not, and that he is constantly offending them. Explain to him that you're not asking him to change, just to put a lid on it for a bit while he is around your family, and make an actual effort to get them to like him. He doesn't have to care if they like him or not, but he most certainly should care if YOU care if they like him. If he wants to marry you then he needs to understand that tension between you and your family is something that you don't want.
rywgn8HLaa	I understand that you are in love with this man, but love sometimes turns a blind eye to certain things - like inappropriate behavior.   You said that he is really short tempered and hot-headed - that is never a good sign. As a police officer he should be able to maintain his cool - I could see why your family and friends have a few concerns.   Also, you need to consider the effects of his childhood - just because your fiance has a job and isn't an addict doesn't mean there aren't underlying problems. Children that come from abusive homes usually have a lot of problems - most develop those problems later on in life.  Think long and hard about what you are getting into. Really listen to what people are telling you and take it into consideration; it sounds like whenever they talk with you about it you think that "he's a good guy; why can't they see that?" But you need to be able to look at him in a different light. Just consider what these people are trying to tell you. I'm sure your family and friends love you very much and are only saying this out of concern.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	>>He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed.    How long have you known your fiance?  Has he ever directed his sarcasm or really short temper toward you?  Has he ever yelled at you, called you a name, rolled his eyes at you, or otherwise verbally abused you?  There are some big red flags here.  And the abusive father is an indicator that he might be an abuser too.    Police officers who are abusers are especially dangerous.  These are guys with guns who also know dangerous police moves, and have law enforcement buddies they can prevent from helping you.  Kathleen Savio, Stacy Peterson, Crystal Brame, and Jessie Davis all died at the hands of their police officer husbands/partners.    I think you should have a serious talk with your family members who don't like your fiance, and see if they are seeing red flags you are missing.|`|c5UAa65qaa	If you want to change their impression of him, then he's gotta pull some weight in that department, too; if he dials back on the jerkiness and lets the caring guy he is with you come through some more, maybe they'll see him in a different light.  Otherwise, the best you can do is acknowledge their concerns but tell them you're happy, and try and limit their exposure to him.|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	We first impressions are everything and apparently he's not making a good one on anyone besides you. If he treats you right and you think he's truly the one, then to hell with everyone else.|`|AA10975867	Sorry, hon, but you are in love and love is blind. Have you ever stopped to think why 99 out of 100 people who know the guy feel that he has a dangerous temper and a lack of genuine personality and that you are the ONLY ONE in the world who sees the "real" him. Sorry but he is being REAL every day on the job when those 99% see him and work with him and see how he reacts with people. He is being UNREAL when he is with you, being romantic and trying to get you into the sack. Sighhhhh.... Your brothers see this guy in action every day and they have known you all your life. They know your personality and they know his REAL personality. Trust them.|`|AA11380378	He grew up with an abusive father blah, blah, blah. everyone has a sad story/trauma and that doesn't give people the right to be jerks to everyone.    He needs to learn to respect others around you. They are your family and friends after all. This type of behavior will make you isolate from everyone, as he won't tolerate you keeping anyone's company and you will be embarrrased to expose anyone that you know to his tyranic treatment.    This is not healthy and a real gentleman would not treat people like trash with such arrogancy. People that love you are telling you because they care about you you and you can't see. People that work in law enforcement particulary have these power trips outside his job and tempers that would flare at the minimum provocation because they will produce a high; the satisfaction of being in control. That's why they have mental health professionals on police Departments. He needs to see mental health as his work and go to temper managment classes.    Good luck|`|D2bx76kJaa	You answered it all in your letter you said he is sarcastic,hot headed short tempered,and out spoken. There you go.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Honestly, it is always a red flag if most of the people around you do not like your significant other. This assumes, of course, that they are a good judge of character.    My sister right now is dating a loser and we have all told her pretty much that. She has been with the guy on and off for years. She keeps telling us that we don't see the good things about him. The reality is that she doesn't see the bad things the rest of us see.    Perhaps you are overlooking his bad qualities. I don't know. What i do know is that if your family and friends don't like him, it is most likely you who are not seeing the bad in him.
71VRvldJaa	Not really.  You might not feel like eating for a couple of days after being under anaesthesia but the pound or two you lose wouldn't be fat, it would be fluid so as soon as you start eating again, you'd regain the little bit you lost.

She also seems abit more down to earth than you do.|`|CIZX6PyQaa	I know this is crud, but is she easy? If so then that is probably why she gets guys and you don't.

She doesn't act like people think she should and that attracts people.|`|SRBC2Y8eaa	It could just simply be because the guys that are interested in her are attracted to her and her personality.  It's not that she is liked more, it's just the guys she gets are into her personality....that's all.  Maybe the guys she gets are weird too, even though they are cute lol.  So don't worry about it, your guy will come(:|`|CC9yXfONaa	If she farts often around people other than you, trust me, no guy would like her. So, we use the scoring system. Blonde: +5. Skinny: +2. Acts like a whore around guys shes never met: + 7565|`|9VhR1XwOaa	Different people like different things though.  Some guys always go for the blonds because they *think* that their pretty and perfect.  Usually, these guys are good looking, but also dumb as hell.  It's just the way people are.  But trust me, there are people out there who think more of dark-haired girls than blonds.  Never go out of your way for the attention.  Just work what you have and be proud of it.  Your friend's looks wont get her everywhere.  It takes a little endeavor to make it in this world.  So don't worry about it hun.  Someone will like you for who you are sooner or later and that's what matters the most.  You'll win.  I'm sure of it :)|`|2pDKXnkZaa	it's because of little out bursts and shes blonde, im sorry but it's a fact the opposite sex likes blondes more then brunette.they did a study, and it was true.I think your a better person and your being yourself in myopinionn shes just trying to getattachingg  with thefartingg and the out bursts. If your in High School or lower, don't  worry you can find a guy that will be there because he likes you for you not because of your hair color and out bursts.There is nothing wrong with you.that's just a blonde for you. and let me tell you something else people believe that brunettes are more trustworthy then a blonde and obviously more smarter.Don't worry honey you find a really cute guy and he'll like you because you are smart and pleasant to be around.|`|cEocs8M1aa	i know how you feel like cus i have this friend and everyone calls us twins. im a little thinner than her but not by much and in a lot of way my situation is simlar to yours.  she always has these guys trailing after her doing whatever she wants out of them and sometimes she treats them terribly!  but some people are just more outgoing or more flirty in general.  i saw her flirt with a guy once and it shocked me because she became a whole entire different person!  but dont worry about it because as your friend is getting all these guys, she is only getting them to feel good about herself and is looking for quantity more than quality.  because you find it hard to like someone or flirt with someone you'll have a better quality than your friend.  dont worry about it so much and dont get sad about her :)|`|zaxxwDAuaa	Maybe it's because guys find her interesting and find her attractive in her way. Some guys don't have to like a girl with big breast and an ***.And she probably doesn't try to get guys to like here. She's probably just being herself and that's what attracts them. Maybe.|`|7RGtUnQJaa	lol, i have no idea.. maybe you hang around guys all the time and other guys don't approach you because of that?  Basically everything you mentioned says that you're better than her.. so i have no idea =p  And I think a cute face and an okay body is better than an okay face and a better body.. maybe her smile is prettier?      Maybe the little chub you mentioned is more to other guys than you may think?  Maybe you're too mellow to a point where you are too shy when new guys talk to you and a lot of guys don't have the guts to handle the conversation talking to a shy girl or simply don't know how to.    That's all I can think of =p
wzpCMI44aa	Wow! You need to make this public and let everyone know about it! Search for anywhere they may be listed online and leave a review telling what happened to you. Make you sure inform the BBB about this as well as everyone else you come into contact with.     This is an absolutely disgusting and pathetic way for anyone to run a business, let alone a photographer who is dealing with your once-in-a-lifetime day! I'm so sorry you went through that!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh my, thats terrible.  im sorry to hear you went through that.  in america, we have a place called the better business bureau, where you can go to their website or call them up and lodge a complaint against them.  perhaps there is something down there like that you can call up and lodge a complaint?       it hasnt happend to me thank god, we're strapped enough for cash as it is.  but i went to a wedding fair this past weekend and while talking to a lot of the photographers it did sound like there would end up being a lot of "hidden costs" so i can understand how quickly it could happen.      im not sure how to prevent it beyond makeing sure you ask them about everything that could possibly cost money.  like, how much extra will it be for this? will it cost any extra if we wanted that? and so on untill the very last letter of the contract is spelled out.      best of luck to you and  anyone else who happens to have been ripped off by photographers.  its a shame when a few bad apples make EVERYONE nervous|`|5WP9rLTlaa	lodge a complaint with the department of fair trading. If you've had this sort of treament from the company then there is a good chance of other couples having reported them. A photographer friend of mine says they do investigate every complaint and they could have their licences revoked if they haven't been honest in business dealings.|`|ldbS2ddFaa	That sounds horrible, you should try to take legal action, and report them to the BBB. My cousin was also scammed by her photographer, she paid for horrible photos, some dark and some too light|`|PBdPD748aa	wow that is really unethical and some of what you mention sounds to be completely illegal too!    I am very fortunate with the photographer i now chose, i live in Sydney and Im getting married in North Queensland - the first photographer up there tried to rip us off and ended up under cutting us and putting someone else instead of our booking cos of more money!!! (thank god).    i was very cautious from the start (they tried to make us pay in full before the day) and i didnt like the sound of it. they act like your best friend and reel you in and me being a little nieve played into it without realising!    The photography company we are going with now sounsd amazing - and they only require half the money and the rest when we SEE the prints - they have even worked out a payment plan with us and have been wonderful to deal with. i think with these things best to follow your gut - people are really 'cut throat' out there.     with what you have been saying i would advise you go to the department of fair trading and see what resolution they will come up with. thats where my next step may be for my diamond ring! my fiance paid 10000 and now we can see inclusions that were never supposed to be there! unbelieveable!!! we deal with terrible customer service and fair trading is our only voice - unless you decide to take it to the media.    good luck with what you choose to do - even your story alone is enough to be heard through fair trading. i know what you are going through and it is terrible :( best wishes
RBxDWMjaaa	Hi again!    Umm well lets see...    13 and 15... That's not TOO bad! 2 years really isn't that big of an age difference.  Are you almost 14?  Is he just turned 15 or almost 16?    It is not necessarily that bad of an age difference.      As long as he is respectable and not pressuring you to do anything then I don't really think that this is that big of a deal.    Is this the friend from the other question?  If that is the case I wouldn't worry too much about that opinion.    She should be supportive of you no matter what you decide to do!     If you think it is right then it is, if you have doubts than I would be concerned.    No its not wrong unless you feel it is wrong!    Hope I Helped!|`|AA12186207	My friends have dated a bunch of douchebags and losers. But then again so have it. When my friends date someone I don't approve of I let her know but I don't nag her about it. I get over it. It's not a big deal.     If your friend stops talknig to you because of this then you know she is not a good friend at all. I have never stopped talking to any of my friends over a boy.

You can't stop your feelings. I hope this has helped! it really sucks that your friend is acting that way, i don't think she will hate you. She will eventually see that it works between you two.|`|SFteh6Mwaa	You should date whoever you like. NOT who your little friend "approves." If she's just telling you she doesn't like him, it's one thing, but if she is saying she won't be your friend if you date him, she isn't worth it.    If this girl is important to you, then tell her that you want to be friends, but it's your life, and by trying to control it, she's only pushing you away. It won't be an easy thing to say, but it has to be done.    Best of luck.    ~Cuteeyeish|`|aKVtNgZGaa	look my friend is 15 and and she dating a 17 year old guy   shes happy but i always tell her to becarful when he want to go somewhere alone   BE HAPPY THAT YOUR FRIEND IS THINKING OF YOU    but if she was really you Friend she would be happy for you and a little worried but at least shes thinking of you|`|NFXQkFEMaa	Okay  I don't think it is too bad because my mom is 50 going on 51 in March, and my dad is 40 going to 41 in October, and they were married since before i was born and now i am 14, plus i had the same problem lst year, i told my friend "plz can u at least try to be happy for me, i mean you don't like him, and he wont be a part of your life, unless you want him to be! So can u get over yourself and be happy for me!"

Xxme8O6Maa	Make no mistake about this, it is very important to have mutual interests with your partner.      As for your relationship with this fellow, well he's already booked and it does not seem as though his attention is coming your way.  I think that your chance came up a few years back, and now he's with somebody new.      Don't ruminate over the past and go on with your life.  Your soul mate will come along.|`|PPXUgYa6aa	I started out liking my best friend in the 7th grade. We used to make out, hold hands and hug all the time but this was before we decided to make it official between us. When we finally made it official the whole school new about us and we were even named the Dynamic Duo in the school year book. But then summer rolled around and I went on vacation and he cheated on me while I was gone. We broke up but decided that were too close to stop talkign to each other. So now were both in the 9th grade, he has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend but every now and then we say "I love you" to each other and we really mean it.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	I liked this guy starting in kindergarten and i only stopped liking him in 8th grade because i changed churches.

He's obviously trying to say something by leaving up that he's in a relationship.   Maybe leave a few hints of your own? Not too subtle he probably won't get it.  But maybe try to talk to him in person like catch him at school or at work or wherever you know he'll be. But not to the point where it's stalkerish =P    Good luck I hope you get him back!|`|fgVb7Tscaa	Go and meet him  talk to him face to face...be polite n sweet n ask for an apology (if u think it is right)...    try not to bring any complains while pacifying him...n tell him how u felt all these days...  i think it will work betn u guys again...|`|L8sPUhayaa	You broke up with him twice? And you want him back? Give it some time at least.
5EtiRi2yaa	Just put good perfume or body spray on. That's like catnip to us. Just depends on the guy's background, maturity level, etc.    To find a good guy you have to be a good girl. Most guys can tell and most girls can tell. Plus you have to know about them. If a guy thinks you're high maintenance then he might go for it if you're hot enough or he might pass b/c he's focused on getting into school and doesn't have the money. It just depends...    Usually common things and interests help glue people together but there's a thin line b/w friendship and liking someone.    Me personally if you're like a girl that's into drama, I'm gonna pass. Some people like that b/c they like the attention,but I'm highly intelligent so that'd annoy me quickly. Liek the girls off of "The Hills". Most of the time those situations would be avoided but it's sooooo dumb. I have friends in relationships like that and I just shake my head. So dumb, but then I could play along and act dumb to to make them feel special.     I hate questions like these b/c it categorizes girls and it categorizes guys instead of letting peopel be individual. Everyone's different so this won't work if you're trying to get with a guy.    Some guys are snobby, some guys are meatheads, some guys are gay, some guys are racists, some guys are insecure,|`|b7gUW0CRaa	if they lik to go crazy and rock out just lik me|`|5I2xl730aa	Normally weather not she will take a joke, like not get all pissed and smack you.

CRvdmFwCaa	I had a boyfriend before my Husband that I dated for 3 years.  I didn't really enjoy sex with him and now that I look back I know why.  1.) We didn't use lube.  Now I realize lube is the first step to making it feel good.  Some KY.  2.)  Do you ever go down on her?  That's fantastic!  Lots of tounge and sucking on her c**t a bit.  3.)  Don't be a selfish lover!  Do you "get her there?".  Make sex about HER sometimes, ya know?  Just kiss her all over for a while.  Play with her.  Tell her you lover her, how beautiful she is, etc...  Foreplay goes a long way.  Don't just jump in and do the deed in-out-over ta-da!  4.)  Ever used a vibrator on her first to get her warmed up for you?  Thats nice.  5.) Variety?  is there variety?  Try different stuff, different places... let Her be in control... find what feels good for her.  6.) And Communication.  That's great you talked to her.  Maybe you should talk to her before you try anything new too.  If she's like that.  Or maybe she likes to be surprised with new things... that's your call.      Hopefully everything works out for you.  Sex is  definitly one of the best parts of a commited relationship.|`|zprAkP3eaa	SHe loves you but just has lost sexual interest, im the same way most of the time, sex has faded for her, so try to make her interested by taking her out more and being more loving and not so sexual, i want to have sex with my b/f more when he acts like he don't want me!
MeGazyy7aa	Well, the best way would to be to just quit, but, you know how that goes...    The next time they ask you for some, give them one, but as your giving it to them say, look you can have one now, but you need to start buying your own.  If they ask again, tell them, I told you start buying your own! I can't pay for mine and yours!|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Charge them a quarter for each cigarette|`|ts4Dg5TDaa	Tell them to buy their own jokingly and that you can't afford to buy for the group. Or if you are feeling generous ask them if they are actually gonna smoke it when they ask|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Either quit or be very rude. Smokes are expensive and they will keep taking from you until you stand up to them and tell them to buy their own.    they may get mad, but what if you were to mooch off of them.
rDbD2Ebyaa	I had the same problem. Me and this guy would talk on the computer all the time. We would see each other in school a lot, but never talk. So about the same problem you're having right? Well, what I'm guessing is maybe that he is too shy to talk to you in person too. So what I did was when I saw him in the hallway, I would wave and say, "Hi." and then he would smile and wave back. It was really awkward at first, because I'm very shy, too. But then after a while of just saying "Hi" and "What's new?" we started to talk all the time in person.     Hope this helps, :)|`|15Zr5voMaa	why don't u just send him a pic and tell him who u really r on the computer by an e-mail|`|iMGeSGdcaa	have one of your friends do it for you...write him a not and give it to him, stick it in his locker....|`|sU7j4p3Iaa	you totally juss gottta get over yourself and talk to him :)   sometimes i have like the same problem and it juss really makes me mad =P  but if you juss do it you probably wont regret it :)  maybbe go talk to him with a budd ??  godo luck hun :)|`|DrFrkM63aa	he's probably thinking the same thing...    just say hi.    not difficult.|`|AA12035186	When you see him in his circle of friends, just look over, smile and whisper "hi".

5DJzp6bMaa	Dont be in a hurry|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Please if you ever take any advice in your life, please please please take this advice, as I did the same thing and made a mistake.      Don't get married, until you have finished school, have a good education , college and a good career started. If you get married now, your life will never be able to progress. Sure right now you are young and think that you dont care, just as long as your are with your spouse. But you will regret it when you are 30-40 years old, and can't even afford to go to the movies or drive a nice car. Trust me, it's much better to wait until you are older.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	The only reason for you to get married is to have sex. Nothing is stopping you from staying together now, so what is the rush other than that? You cannot support yourselves, wait until you have an education and a good job established.|`|AA11967247	ok, so you love her and want to be with her forever, whats the hurry to have to be married. the only thing thats going to change is added stress when you will have to take on ALL the responsibility of an adult.   be together, be together forever, marriage isnt going to change that right now.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Will you still love her if you're not married?|`|uvWuVWb1aa	If you love her, then do the right thing and wait to get married. Wait until you have a stable job and have money saved up so you can afford a place to live. And wait until you're old enough to get a place of your own. You can still love each other, you don't have to get married. I have a feeling that you may have that desire because your sexual feelings are taking over and you want to get married so you can have sex. Regardless of the reason, you are way too young.|`|P1KbWHImaa	Dont you understand, you cant rent an apartment, YOUR TOO YOUNG. you barely can get a drivers license, let alone a WORK permit, which one or both of you will have to quit school in order to pay those bills.    please. love each other. thats fine. but listen to people who know better. who have been there. all our stories are the same for a reason. Its TOOOOOO YOUNG.  The quickest way to ruin your love is by rushing it.|`|RtkB46peaa	You're both out of your minds.  If you want to wait until you're married to have sex, fine.  That's you're choice.  But seriously, why do you want to get married now?  You're still going through puberty?      In my opinion, no one under 25 should get married.  If you don't agree with me, check the divorce stats and maybe you'll see what I mean.  Oh, and the whole, "we're Christian, so we won't get divorced" is a nonsense arguement.  You and she will change DRASTICALLY in the coming years.  Marriage at your age is a really bad idea.|`|kvcIdORcaa	if you really love each other and she's "the one", she will still be there with you after you both graduated and finished college. you don't need to rush into it.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	If you two really do love each other, take this into serious consideration:    Statistically, by marrying young, you stand a much higher chance of :    Divorcing;  Not getting a college degree;  Earning LESS money.    Think about this. 16 may feel like an age where you can make a life-changing decision like this, but you really do need to take your time, and focus on school, saving up some money, graduating, going to a good college, and establishing yourself in a well-paying career before you get married. If you two do love each other, you will make these your goals first. Then, my friend, your marriage will be successful BECAUSE you made sure all the points of potential disaster are out of the way beforehand.|`|h8z5nanYaa	My dear boy, it is nice to hear dat U dont want 2 have sex b4 mariage. However, marriage at your age is not advisable.    Like U, I am a christian also, I'm 34yr have had 2 masters & presently on PhD and have not tasted sex. My girlfriend, 28, is a virgin as well and hope to finish at Univ. to become a medical doctor in June dis year (2009). We intend to marry around Dec. Like U & Ur girlfriend, we love each other for 8yrs but determined to get married only after our education and strongly belive in no sex b4 marriage.    MY ADVICE:  Please,there is time 4 everything under heaven, both of U shud try & complete ur edu and have a career first.It is then u would have a HAPPY MARRIED LIVES. Think of the type of family structure you intend to build- LOW class, MIDDLE class or HIGH class? .    In conclusion of the whole epistle, I advice you to wait until U are older and able to PROVIDE for ur dream family.    Best wishes,  Omo Naija|`|2fG6NpUkaa	well i want to say it may sound like a love story but i don't know about that. I was in the same place as you are. And honestly it did not work out it was the hardest thing i have ever had to do. It may sound like a good idea at the moment but its not the best thing to do at 16 but do what you want if you feel its the right thing to do then do it!    k, here are some answers i can tell you,    you tell your parents together, and if your parents loved you enough and want the best for you in life to make you happy, then they would not get to mad, ummm i honestly think you guys should, its worth the wait TRUST ME. i have no idea if it is cuz i don't live out there. And if you get your parents to sign papers saying that it would be ok if you two where to get married.      I hope this works out for you!   good luck with everything!!!|`|TVz2UoOyaa	dont rush! you're too young to get married..
vu3YCN6Jaa	there's nothing you can do or say, just don't give him any reason not to trust you!  it probs will take him some time to get over what She did to him, and if you are prepared to wait for that, then go for it.  Just be careful, i've been in this situation before, and the guy never could completely open his heart to me because he had been hurt before, and i ended up the one who was heartbroken!   good luck though.|`|DxohE884aa	Gosh he has issues. I say, you're too good for him.  But if you want to keep trying...  I guess he is trying, so that's a positive sign. If he gets controlling, that would be a negative sign. What you're doing now, being with him a lot, is good. Just be very positive & obviously loyal. However, don't center your life around him - it will hurt if it doesn't work out.  Good luck!|`|ebOmvMGfaa	hate to say this, but you can't really love someone if you don't trust them. you need to find out asap how he really feels. because if he doesn't trust you that could not only cause problems in the future, but it might mean that he doesn't love you the way he says he does. trust is one of the biggest parts of relationships, and if you don't have it then it isn't a relationship at all.|`|YTSJR9V1aa	i'm the exact same way as your boyfriend. i have trust issues for different reasons, but the way i act is pretty much the same.  i always feel so guilty and i know it must be terrible, but just be aware that when he says he loves you, he really does mean it. if he really does have trust issues, he wouldnt say that and not mean it. and he is probably trying very hard to trust you, it just takes time.  it will happen eventually, though.  just be patient and show him that you will let him do whatever he needs to so he can learn to trust you. that will help a ton.  good luck!|`|qIziYpVAaa	It's hard to trust anyone after someone really hurts you. I still have a really hard time trusting men after being cheated on by an ex-boyfriend.And that was years ago. I'm married now but somehow that experience stayed with me,and sometimes I have a hard time trusting my husband.It's not that he doesn't want to trust you .He's just scared that he's going to get hurt again.|`|rxx9ub7haa	Just sit down with him and say to him "I can't pretend to understand the pain of your previous relationship but I think we have got to a stage in our relationship where we can trust each other with anything"|`|VYGHiQuyaa	Ask him what you do to make him not trust you. You probably have an idea of why he doesnt trust you.|`|zw7B0Zciaa	Coming back from a broken heart is really hard to do. Him not fully trusting yu rlly has nothing to do wit yu. he's just scared of letting anyone way to close and then the chance of getting his heart broken again.   all you can do is be there for him and be the best girl friend you can be. i'm not telling you to do whatever he wants but just be there for him when he needs you and go out with him and have a good time.|`|9BiMgggIaa	Ask him. It may seem like he might get mad at you for asking but if he really loves you then he'll tell you and if he does get mad then he'll forgive you. Trust is the main key in a relationship. You have to ask him what's going on.|`|5hBhmjHHaa	give him time how long ago did the girl break his heart prove to him that he can trust u|`|iq1EgWkdaa	I think that all you can do here is wait.

Depending on how he was hurt and how bad it actually was can have a huge impact. Best thing to do is to tell him how much you care for him, and tell him constantly you'd never do a thing to hurt him in anyway. He will eventually gain plenty of trust in you and your relationship will be perfect. It's not that he doesn't love you nor trusts you, its the fact he is scared of being hurt again. Give him some time, but let him know you will never do anything to hurt him and that you love him! :)     Good luck!|`|N9DW9tpPaa	most women that are pretty are closet whores. doing people, lying, and getting away with itis what they're great at.i manage a club so i see it all like a fly on the wall. that's why snoop dogg says a woman is learning her man, earning her man, and at the same time burning her man. i don't trust women. when a man cheats he does it for recreation fun and confidence boosting and come back to his girlfriend or wife and truely love her without an issue. but women however always try to turn a good lay into a relationship. love is chemical called oxytocin you get it when you done really well and that's what he's at least partly affraid of.
AA10746669	First, you can't be a family if you are not together.    Second, don't have a baby out of wedlock.    Third, if you have a baby, and no husband, you are on a slippery slope, and heading for a multitude of problems.    Fourth, a cart behind a horse is great for the cart and the horse, but a cart in front of a horse is miserable for both the cart and the horse.      DON'T PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE!    Fifth, if you had 10 eggs, thinking that you would have 10 chickens, and later found out that only 7 hatched, and of those, 2 died, you would have only half of what you expected.    DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH!      Life conducted according to the ever-changing whims of society is very unstable and unreliable and susceptible to many unforeseen variables.

This isn't the kind of commitment you want to trick someone in to. You need to thoroughly discuss something like this with you boyfriend. It would be as much his child as yours, and he has a right to know what you're planning. If you two are in as stable of a relationship as you say, it shouldn't be a problem to bring it up.|`|IdWS9Afiaa	well as long as you are ready to take what you want you want to do and make it work because once you have your kid its no longer about you its about that child|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Okay. University,career? You'll have a baby when You're 19, will You and Your boyfriend have enough food on the table for the three of You? Will he not run away from you in a couple of months, because He is not ready for this yet? Will the baby that will be growing will be surrounded by all the care in the world, when You might be strugling to make it through another day?  Concider all of this, please...  And in the mean time, I would advice you to talk to your boyfriend, INFORM HIM that you are not on the pill anymore and.. well maybe volunteer at a local nursery with little children?   However, if it still hasn't changed your mind-then it is YOUR own life and You can live it the way you prefere, just make sure You have a strong backup and good luck whatever you choose!x|`|zprAkP3eaa	You really just need to come out and tell him that your not on the pill, just b/c he said he will stand by you don't mean he will.|`|6zw5smf9aa	dont jump into this real fast, at least get married first|`|0AShsMsoaa	you want my comment? here is my comment:  your  moronic question  having less to do with you but with innocent children you selfishly want to have but have no clue how to take care of or provide for in the future, is why mcdonalds will never ever run out of people to work the drive thru window.      i will have fries with that.|`|1TRlzSsYaa	Well, just tell him plain and simple. "Dude, I want a baby." And if meant what he said, he will stand by you and take good care of the kid. Maybe you should do something romantic and ask after all the fuss is over. That way, it'll seem "special". BTW, do you plan on getting married any time soon?|`|AA12249040	These type of things must be decided between two of you, not just you.  Otherwise it is not fair on him. No  matter what he says.   Babies are very rewarding and fantastic, but have you considered travelling the world first? There are a lot of thing you can not do when you have a baby.   Are you financially sound? Don't bring baby into this world if you can not support her/him financially. Otherwise it is not fair on the baby.  Try to weigh those things. Don't just think of what you want or what you are ready for. Otherwise its selfish.|`|10zaYXqGaa	Listen, first stop, think and leave all the intense emotions behind. It is perfectly natural to have your natural clock screaming for babies, but you have to stop and think. First, do you have the means to support a baby? It costs a lot, even when they're small. Second, you can't cheat your boyfriend into becoming a father, it is not fair for him, cause he might have a very different opinion and you'll have to respect it, and not force him otherwise. Third, you're very young, and having a baby might cost you some things, not just money. For example, with a baby, it'll be hard to go to college, with a baby, there are no night outs, no vacations with friends, no wacky life proper to an 18 year old. Think carefully, cause I don't wan't to be mean, but with a baby, most of your freedom disappears. Whatever you do, do NOT trick your boyfriend into being a father, he might not want to loose his freedom. Please think, and wait a few years before having a baby.|`|AA11117367	First off, get back on the pill, and do not stop taking it until you and your boyfriend have had time to talk, thought about it and have come to a mutually, rational, and practical decision. It isn't fair for you to be deceitful to him, by not taking your birth control pill, without his knowledge. As far as, when the right time to start a family is, that will be between you and your significant other, but it must be an open and upfront, bilateral decision. Things will go a lot smoother, and happier, for you and your partner, and the baby. Good Luck!|`|kUbRHq3vaa	dude thats wat dey all say, ur 2 young 2 stast ur own family cuz u may not be financial strong, wait till u done college or moreover have a stable job. and dont listen 2 ur bf he might ive u once u have a kid!!! face the reality he might. u have to wait till its the rite time.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	The responsible and mature thing to do would be to discuss it with him. If you can't do that you are certainly not responsible and mature enough to care for a child.    In one of your recent questions you wrote,"why do i feel that deliberately trying to get myself pregnant is the only way too keep him."  You also wrote, "if i do annoy him and/or make him angry he goes home."   So what is it you really want, a child or a stable relationship?  And where is the trust in your relationship? I sounds like he can't trust you and you can't trust him?  I think stopping contraception and getting pregnant without discussing it is not evidence of a "stable, trusting relationship." And it might annoy and anger him more than anything you have ever done before. He is likely to go home and not come back.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hi There Barmycow       Yes you're quite right you are a touch on the young side to be saying things like your body clock is changing.  Could I suggest you hit the snooze button and enjoy the love you and your boyfriend are currently sharing.  Here's a question to consider, will your fella still love you as much when, he has to start sharing the love that, he is at present, enjoying exclusively.       I ask this because whether you think so or not your love for your fella will or should at least,  change.  Due to the fact that a mother's first and main concern is and should be, quite naturally for her baby.  Quite frequently men can feel as sense of rejection  initially at least.  This is where most relationships fail because this Sense of rejection has not been previously considered fully.         So please before you put yourself through the heart ache of a breakup or worst still bring another child  who may end up being or feeling rejected, remember it's you that wants the child. not the child asking to be born , at this point you are still in control.  Into the world. Please,please, please.  Hit the snooze button on that body clock have a lay in or just enjoy practising, enjoy the sex while you can.       Sex for my ex-wife was never the same, "not as enjoyable" she said after the birth of our first born, when she received a third degree internal tear and received a lot of sutures.   What ever you decide    God Bless You always Amen
syWS4ep1aa	All you should have asked is "is it normal for teens to fight their parents all the time?".  The answer is YES. I fought my parents every day when I was a teen, my brother did, our cousins, everybody. It's the bloody hormones. I take it from your picture your a girl. You should be thankful you aren't a boy, I had to make inhuman efforts not to hit my dad when I was 15.

The only thing you can do now is learn from whatever experience you've had: Did you take a cheater back? Trust a guy that said that his "female best friend" was ONLY his friend? Lose your virginity to someone who dumped you the next day? Whatever it was, take it and learn from it, and don't put yourself in the situation in which you CAN be hurt again.     Give yourself some time to heal from what's happened. Allow yourself a few days to wallow, then pick yourself up and get on with your life. Show that jerk that you CAN indeed live without him and that you've realized that he's not as great as you first thought!     Good luck, and hope you feel better soon!|`|epQXDf9Kaa	And keep this lesson forever  Don t ever believe what you are told anymore until you have the ring(even then...but s better, at least the guy was somewhat sincere)...

2vaGZ4eDaa	*I confronted her after she returned home late one night.  I had no specific evidence, but I surprised her and she admitted it.  They had not been physically involved at that point.  *She left for awhile.  She continued to see him while we were separated.  It was bad.  *Their relationship collapsed.  I think their relationship only worked asd a fantasy - the moment they could really be a couple, it fell apart.  *We got back together, and are somehow still married 21 years later.  No, she hasn't cheated again.|`|rKWJ2nKQaa	I found out because the girl called his cellphone    hint:  if his cellphone is always inaccessable..on silent when with you..or left in the car..problem    computer activity; software available to install that will tell you what he's doing online    he denyed it..but she and i begin to email and i found out all of it......tell them when you are ready to leave, emotionally, financially.........i did stay and it's hell.........i can't trust him and i certainly don't want to give him my heart..............i always question everything he does and i wish i had not taken him back|`|L8kSyfThaa	History never repeats itself does it?  Seems it will  always be  the same...until he came?.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I've been cheated on quite a few times by different partners over the years. In every case, the thing that clued me in first was always how each respective partner was acting. They would be distant, irritable, always picking fights about any little thing I said, and not wanting me to do their laundry or go near their vehicle. After I realized that they could be cheating, I started noticing other clues: Coming home later from work, late night phone calls, phone numbers in their pockets with no name on them, objects in their car that I didn't recognize. Things like that.     For the most part I confronted them straight-out with the evidence; most of the time they denied it even after proof was in their faces. Only one admitted it afterwards. I always told them as soon as I had enough proof that they couldn't deny.     I stayed with the first one who cheated on me. BIG mistake. He did it again and again and again. And when I caught him he turned abusive.|`|0ylm04PWaa	My suspicions began with being given the not-so-subtle hint to call before showing up at his job. I never had to do that before. Then our typical things we used to do changed, because he had to allot his mistress time. Plus the changes in attitude, Yuki mentioned irritability. Oh yeah! The breaker was when I noticed pictures he kept of me in his wallet were missing. On that note, eventually found out it was a girl at work.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	their behavior lead them to get caught|`|QIQNzE11aa	I found out because his other 3 fiancee's found out about me. He was good. They came to my home and confronted me. I'd say the marriage was towards the end of it before i knew about them. I told them to leave me out of it. I had told my husband for the last several months that i was going to divorce him. So i truly did not care by that point.     When i finally left he accused me of cheating, i told him quietly every girls name who came to our house and the date they came. I told him they were all very upset to learn he wasn't divorced and had three fiancee's. he shut up. I never cheated.    I actually have a few friends who have been cheated on and they actually worked it out and stayed. Now they are very happy and have been together a long time since that awful time in their life.     Cheating does not have to mean break up, only if you want it too. Not all cheaters will cheat again. But, one must have counseling to find the causes and help them to change.|`|AA11967247	a friend finally told me  on the phone  i didnt find out for over a year, but called him from the state i was currnetly visiting immediately.  yes, we stayed together, but divorced several years later.|`|L38M9lrLaa	i found out cause i read there texts..and went thru there phone confronted immediately and asked them if theyve been talking to any girls..and yes i stayed cause we have a son together..this is his last chance|`|RoOAckfJaa	i left her and she chased me saying that it will never happened again. but in order for me to accept her apology she begged and she felt that i was hurt for almost 2 weeks calling and calling to try to get her attention. this is a good way if ur hurt and u love him do that and if he loves you he will come back feeling and hurt inside that he wants you.|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	I had a suspicion.  I saw a strange number on the phone bill from Utah, 1+ hour calls whenever I was not around.  Usually in the morning when I went to work.  Confirmation came when I called it.  He was lying to her too.     I waited a month before I made that call.    He is now my ex fiance.  I'm glad I didn't marry him.    Would I change my method?  Probably not.  I had asked him about the number before and he gave me some big BS lie.|`|H0mtagXoaa	The first time, i had a feeling and then he told me.  The 2nd time, i had a feeling and tricked the girl into telling me! you want tips on how to do this email me.   I waited until he got home from work, and then I told him what i new and how i found out.  And no that time i didn't stay with him, I *u*k*d his friend and filed for divorce.      What i did made two wrongs, I was not the right thing to do. But we all make mistakes, my was just out of spite and sweet revenge!|`|ByUS0k8waa	A women called while he was in the shower. Then a wonderful voice mail that was left for him I found when he asked me to check his voice mail for him and write all of them down with the number. Like I was his secretary!     I called the girl and we ended up confronting him together!!! We waited til he got home and we were sitting there talking.     I waited about a week or so. Til we could get together to confront him together.     Nope dumped his a*s in a heart beat. I didn't really feel that bad about dumping him and I never missed him. Just hurt worst that he was sleeping around on me.
siTibEIGaa	Use to be A, then over the couple of years, I've moved towards C. Sex is pointless to me unless I love the woman I'm with.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Is it ok with you? You are the only one who can make this decision.    Why *wouldn't* you date while separated? If you can come up with a good reason to wait, then wait. If not, then date all you want. It's a personal choice.    I don't feel that paperwork equals commitment; just as you were in a committed relationship before you signed your marriage license, your commitment is null and void when you decide to separate and file for divorce. However, if you feel that only legal divorce can terminate the commitment which binds you to your soon-to-be-ex, then this is your view, and that's just that. No one else can tell you what to do.|`|acwVRTIqaa	seperated to try new things....see if there's someone else out ther..ofcourse there is nothin wrong with dating  while seperated|`|VSVQHKwKaa	If there are kids involved, then you date when they are out of the house.    Otherwise, it's whenever you want.     Good Luck!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I think it's fine to date after you're separated on a moral level, but on a legal level you should ask your lawyer. You don't want any trouble for adultery, that's for sure! But on a strickly moral level I don't see a thing wrong with it. You're already separated, the feeling of divorce is mutual so no feelings should be hurt here.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Of course...move on with your own life.      Did you wait for the official marriage cert before you start dating your husband?    If not, then why wait for the official divorce decree before you start getting over your husband?|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I've not been in that situation so I really have no idea what I would do.  It would depend on the arrangement I had with my separated spouse, and also who I met.  But in truth, knowing that I was still technically married, I don't think I would outwardly seek to immediately date.  I'd probably wait till the divorce was settled and even then...maybe a year after that.  I can't see myself being in a hurry.

But overall, personality and looks last.
1vZ1n0agaa	it sounds likes she likes you and that you're overanalyzing some parts (although it's understandable)    i'd definitely go for it, ask her out just so you can find out what's up. if she says no, it shouldnt be that embarassing either because it sounds like everyone else thinks she likes you. but if she doess say yes, you can ask her why she was being weird  there doesnt seem to be any other option besides killing yourself with useless why's|`|AnRxCLZXaa	that is very confusing. i'll pray for you|`|CrqfccNBaa	thats not such a big deal. i think its time u as her out. dont worry ur just getting paranoid lol|`|Xq8nStTfaa	idddnn im a girl and i know that one day i text a guy and do the whole smiley face hahahahah then the next day i just don't feel interested anymore and i don't really say anything then the next day i'm all smiley faces. i don't know it's weird? not that i don't like the kid, just random emotions.    anyway back to your question, ask her out, you can dooo it:)|`|TwxlXbGsaa	Your either stuck in the friends zone or you texted her too much and really did annoy her. Leave her alone for a while then try again later if you must... Or just find another girl.|`|rxx9ub7haa	if u really care 4 her perhaps ypu could said to her,  well I have this friend and she's really pretty, etc (describe her) then sort of ease into the conversation that she's that girl|`|v88uWFhDaa	I had a situation very similar to that a year ago. Its a hard choice between pursuing and hoping to be more than friends, or wrecking your friendship. I would say, just go for it. Confidence is key. If she doesnt like you back, dont give up, keep up the persistence but dont let it be awkward  good luck!|`|R5mmX9Woaa	Maybe she thinks you need some space, or she is nervous about the relationship. Give it sometime, it sounds like she really likes you.|`|AQmcmW6paa	Girls will be girls, and sometimes girls just want attention. I know this sounds bad, but what I used to do before I got the guy I liked, I would casually complain about the cold or something, knowing he would ask me if I wanted his jacket. But I declined. Sounds like shes playing games, so you might want to watch out. But she also might like you. When she mentions something, she wants to know your reaction. Your giving her what she wants so now she's playing around with you. Could be good news, or not. Just don't get to attached. If she seems confusing, don't be bummed out. You've made your move, now it's her turn.|`|5zh5Qz8kaa	It kind of depends on the girl, but maybe she's just not good at talking to guys? I don't know, maybe you make her nervous. I know I'm that way, sometimes I'm completely comfortable with a guy, and then the next time I see him, I feel totally weird around him. Can't explain it.  Good luck.|`|7YJs0Gs7aa	I think she just might like you kid!  As far as the not wanting the ride home... maybe she is cautious.  scared.  maybe her mother brought her up right about getting into cars with people.  Im trying to put myself in her shoes.  LOL.  ask her in a text why are you the one to text first. say why don't you chase me why do i have to chase you. be funny then come straight out.  Hey I like you!!!  you only live once man don't let the time pass you by.  Girls are funny when it comes to this stuff.  Good luck|`|8xqmBQNiaa	Its time to ask her out or watch your relationship fade away. If you ask her out and she says yeah then she will stop being so boring and inconsistent with you, and you seem like you have a good connection so i think it will last. If she says no then you will know how she feels about you and you can continue to grow your relationship as friends instead. Even if you don't ask her out, keep trying, don't let her drift away from you, she makes you happy.
tCiVuFK9aa	Hurry, right now make an appointment for counseling.  You think this is a hard adjustment for you, think about what it must be like for him and the daughters.  You all need to go to family counseling.  Save this marriage, give it a chance at least.  Red|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	I can relate to some degree.  When I had to work away from home for a while, my wife got used to another set of daily routines of taking care of the children without me around.  When I got back, she had to readjust the routine with back in the picture.  It was hard for her for a while but our commitment to each other and our shared love was more important than a daily routine so we adjusted.  When my wife was gone for three months with our oldest daughter out of state, I had my youngest daughter to myself for those three months.  We had a great time together and when my wife returned she was a bit jealous of the great time we had without her.  Again, it took some adjustment but our love and commitment was more important than the temporary routine so the necessary adjustments were made.  In other words, learn to love your husband again and give yourself some time to create a new routine and make the necessary adjustments.  It is the right thing to do.|`|a3Vm8Z2Zaa	Get used to it. He is your husband, he obviously loves your children. You shouldn't take your children's father away from them because of your own selfish reason.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	i think part of you is just scared he ill snap again. I have to say my hubby would have done the same and then you are probably not in love with him anymore, that comes from in you. No one can give you the answer for that but you. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|AA12223669	I think it will fall back into place. Although he didn't intentionally leave you alone, he did leave you to deal with all of these problems. Maybe you found some inner strength and you dislike that you no longer have that "single mom" thing. Maybe it made you feel good to know you were strong enough to take care of your girls all by yourself.    I think you shouldn't say anything for a little bit. Try to get back into the swing of things and if you still have problems, tell him you aren't ready for him to just move back in. That you need space, and that he should get an apartment for a little while until you slowly adjust.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	He's your husband and your kids deserve their father.  Yeah, he was in prison but he went because he was protecting his family.  Be grateful that you have a man that loves his family that much.  Of course, your not used to him yet.  Change takes time and it will happen.|`|lN5d688gaa	Give him time.  He loves his children, don't take that away from him.  He already missed a year of their lives.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	Maybe you just love being single. I cannot blame the husband for standing up for your daughter so in reality, he is not to blame but coming back all the sudden is messing with your daily routine. I would get some counseling and see if that will help. Good luck to you and the kids.|`|c1gnFE8Gaa	The poor guy he goes to jail for defending his daughter, you guys are prob the only thing that keep him going all that time in there and he comes home to this.    You are being extremely selfish    Yes there will be an adjustment period but come on the poor guy    On another note how could you have been on top of the world with your Husband in jail, I would have been counting the day down till he could come home|`|e1b44601c9cee963123690929c7f64b2aa	Sounds like you made the adjustment to single mom with no trouble ,was this something you had been thinking about long before it happened ? this could be why you are so uncomfortable , and Your husband can be a father from where ever he lives it doesn't have to be with you .
RtkB46peaa	If she "likes" you, then no, it's not appropriate to her, or your GF.|`|c5UAa65qaa	There's nothing wrong with female friends.  There is a problem with female friends you have to hide from your girlfriend and vice versa.  If your girlfriend's insecurity issues are affecting your social life to the point where you feel like you have to keep secrets from her, then that's something you need to address by talking with her, even if it's uncomfortable.  As for the other girl, be upfront with her about your status; if she is hoping for more, it's not fair to leave her thinking she's got a shot.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	People will see differently on this. Some will say it's ok, others will say it's not.    In my opinion, it would be wrong. chances are, this girl was being nice to you because she's interested in you in a relationship way. I think it would be best to just stick to your girlfriend and leave this other girl alone. But if you desire to be her friend so strongly, then you should also be willing to allow your girl friend to have male friends that she talks to and hangs out with.|`|tqoZZUQJaa	It is wrong to talk to the other girl because your girl doesnt like it. If she went to a party and was talking to a dude that liked her you wouldnt like it. She wont be just a friend when something goes wrong with you and your GF get into a big fight you might do something stupid because you have a girl right there who likes you and you know she likes you. Its not worth losing a relationship|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you aren't trying anything with this girl and she is really just a friend, if she isn't trying to get any where with you and she really sees you as a friend, and if you and she are willing for her to be friends with your GF then it's alright to have her as a friend.    if either of you has ulterior motives or if you have to hide the friendship from your GF then it's not alright to have her as a friend.    as to your GFs insecurities:  you help solve that problem by being open and honest with your GF about what is going on and you introduce her to your new friend and you encourage them to be friends.    if that doesn't work to ease her fears then you have to decide which is more important to you.  Having friends who are girls or having your GF.    (fwiw:  I have male friends, but I don't keep male friends who my partner sees as  threat to our relationship.  As he's not insecure and as he knows and trusts me, I take him seriously when he sees a potential threat.  and yes, in the past I did dump a BF because he was threatened by any male, including my brothers, who I came into contact with.)|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Dude, you are so not ready for marriage.  You have a gf, why the hell would you accept another girls number.  Break up with your gf so you can be the player that you are.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	is it ok if your girl friend does the same thing|`|0M45cne5aa	no, no, no. You shouldn't be friends with this girl. This is something i always tell my boyfriend, and i'm pretty sure he thinks the same for me. 'If you have a friend(s) of the opposite sex before we go out, keep them. But don't meet other people while we're together'. Even though i think both my boyfriend and i can be insecure with us around other people, i know that he's been friends with them, and there's nothing there besides a friendship, and i dont expect him to drop people for me. But to meet another girl while we're dating, why?! You don't need that friendship, you shouldn't get to know the girl good enough to create a strong friendship if you have a girlfriend. It's really good that your intentions aren't bad and that you don't want to hurt your girlfriend or anything, but still.. have you ever thought about what this girl wants. I'm sure people don't just automatically give out their number thinking "oh, me and this kid will make great friends". Her reasoning was probably "wow this kid is cute" or "I might be interested in dating him". Do you think SHE cares you have a girlfriend? Just because you do doesn't mean she's going to. I would just stick with the girl friends you already have, and make guy friends if you want more friends, it's not like you'll be hanging out one on one with these chicks anyway. =)|`|K8OjmMUAaa	It's perfectly alright to have friends of the opposite sex while you're dating someone! You're not cheating on your girlfriend, and as long as you don't have any intentions of getting together with this friend then I think you're ok. You need to mention to that girl, though, that you are dating someone - chances are that she gave you her number because the two of you hit it off and she thinks you're single.     As far as your girlfriend being insecure, you could always introduce the two of them once the friend knows about her. Just tell your girlfriend that you met this cool girl at whatever party and you think that she will really like her. Invite a group over, NOT just the girl, introduce them. If your girlfriend likes the girl, she'll feel more comfortable with you being friends with her.     good luck..|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	You sound really young, you are not ready to have a serious relationship.  You like female attention, so go get it while you can, but before that let your girlfriend go.
dDDAbqqhaa	If I knew a guy who was beating up an innocent girl i'd stuff him in the trunk, find a river and dump the remains|`|CrqfccNBaa	she should NOT get married to this guy. STOP IT DO SOMETHING! TALK TO HER ABOUT IT! have a looong discussion about it|`|PPA30E8naa	yeah of course we're still mates|`|19TSkwaKaa	Mates with potential....  You need to be careful  You could get her seriously hurt if this dude finds out!!!    Wait untill hes out of the picture|`|5VdB8njTaa	Ease off carefully mate, don't text her so much to. What will happen is this: she'll start to wonder if you like her still and she'll start to chase after you. Don't ignore her tho, but get one thing clear, don't get between them because I've seen this before and most of the time its the nice guy who gets the bum deal, ie she'll walk off with him after you've been scrapping.   If she wants you and has any feelings for you, she'll get rid of him. BUT if not, you gota be prepared to keep your relationship plutonic or walk away from her. TRUST ME
ip7CtK0faa	I have went through this before. It's not that you are jealous or a spoiled brat even so don't listen to that mess! It's just that when you really want something and have to work hard and save to get it. Then someone close to you just goes out and just get the same thing you wanted. It just makes you a little upset that you can't obtain those things that you desire so easily. It does feel like a kick in the belly when it is someone that's close to you gets the very same thing you wanted. You kinda feel like they are purposely trying to make you feel bad. But far from it. Just continue to work hard, save up for that iphone or what ever I promise you will appreciate it more when you finally do get it. Besides your boyfriend can tell you about the pros and cons of that iphone before You spend your hard earned money, cause trust me he ain't gonna like it...I don't!  How do I know? I had a friend buy that very same phone, I got a little mad, but when he said he hated it I was so glad I didn't get one!  Go for the Blackberry Curve you will love it!|`|YTSJR9V1aa	i dont know WHY itd make you so mad.  you dont know whether or not he wanted it before hand.  its an iphone... thats pretty popular.  i think its slightly ridiculous...|`|PTKPlcwdaa	its probably bugging u because your jealous, but don't want to be, it just happens|`|yChNsa85aa	kuz ur totally jealous    just tell him he cant buy ur love...haha how does that have to do with this ..wait it kinda does =]|`|VYGHiQuyaa	I think it's because you are jelous he got a new phone? Don't be.|`|aIEkNM0Paa	your just jealous its normal but i think its not healthy for your relationship..|`|26898d87344fc67ec856f786662efe9baa	you wanted it, he wanted it.  What's the big deal?  Is there any rule that you both can't have the same phone??|`|WfiaKovFaa	cuz he got it before you.  and you really want it your just kind of envy.|`|coogXEeeaa	this is annoying you because you are jealous. its not bad to be jealous, its just that he got something you really wanted, you like it so much it makes you sorta angry you don't have it! its okay, happens to the best of it.    he probably didn't get it to rub it in your face, maybe he likes similiar things and maybe thats why  you guys should be dating, your good for eachother =] ahah.|`|Sy0HXSt5aa	Why does this make you mad! It makes no sense this is what you wanted, he was just trying to be nice jeez. If my boyfriend got me an iPhone I would be going crazy over him not complaining about it. But I guess if it makes you that mad tell him to return it idk.|`|nsmbYWdFaa	well, maybe ur just jealous, and thats a normal feeling, but, maybe also cuz he knew u wanted 1, but he didnt get it 4 u ..|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Because your acting like a small child.    Jealous because he got his before you got yours.    Grow up and get over it.|`|iMGeSGdcaa	i may be wrong, but....    maybe he did something that could jeopardize the relationship and you just haven't found out about it yet...and maybe with some hope, now that he bought you the new expensive phone you wanted...you'll forgive him.    psychologically in your mind, you think this is true..maybe that's why you are mad...|`|Ze9zBF5raa	You don't want him to be exactly like you. I know that when I'm in a relationship, I like it if a girl is different than me, so that she can show me her hobbies, and I can show her my amazingly amazing video game techniques.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	not sure why. you can still get it. you should have told him to get it for you. if he has it like that.|`|zLzwaCpcaa	Often times, people can get extremely jealous for reasons that aren't even that much of a big deal, such as cell phones. You have been saving for one, so you are angered thinking that the phone your boyfriend has, should in fact belong to you. These are normal feelings that I have personally experienced. Even though your boyfriend knew you wanted that phone, he wasn't just about to get a different one because you had your eye on it first. My suggestion would be to save for this iphone that you have been wanting, once you have saved enough and finally get to hold it in your hands, it will have been worth the wait.|`|6zw5smf9aa	it sounds to me like he wants to get on your nerves n make you jeolous. remember that revenge is NOT the answer to this. does he really love you?? plus, look on the bright side! you have a bed, a house, food, a family, and a life. think about it.|`|VIDh3oUVaa	mmmm and why ur mad? no sense xD!|`|sNr9Od89aa	youre jealous|`|1cBV1V3iaa	because he got what u wanted its called jealousy|`|ei0Wryytaa	he's just showing off   so yeah|`|kB7UsIXdaa	jealousy, envy. even if you don't want to admit it, your peeved that he went and got the thing you wanted. and you prolly also don't want to admit that you feel like hes waving it in your face.  just try to forget about it and remember he wouldn't do that to you.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	You are jealous.|`|DjtNLFHsaa	you are jealous.|`|3m8JgWj1aa	because he was able to get it right away and you are saving up for it and its just a classic you want what you dont have. just keep working hard :) plus by the time you save up for it there will be something better out probably|`|oXvOxYy0aa	because you probably think that he got it just to rub it in your face... i'm sure he didnt|`|EncopDCmaa	because your jealous.  Your working for it and he just got lucky!    Don't be mad at him though because who doesn't want an iphone?    Good luck!|`|3wHb8DnWaa	its jealousy and anger on your part....you feel he knew you wanted it and some part of you thinks he did this on purpose and that he was inconsiderate for not getting you one|`|gafi3P4Faa	You're probably  just a little jealous,  it's a natural feeling doesn't mean  you're some bad person, you just  really wanted something that somebody else  got.|`|KpNaPyiZaa	It might be bugging you becuase he got it before you and he knew you wanted it. He might be showing you up, so you shold let him know how you feel!|`|m9UOMBykaa	Because your jelouse, and he knew you wanted it so in your mind you think he did it on purpose. Just ignor it and predend his one is rubbish and the one your going to get is better xD  xxx|`|d9K5Utgdaa	jelousy sista but u know wut hes mean he should of got u one to my b.f got me the dare cus he got a new phone and he knew i wanted it so yeah hes so nice|`|bWUgVvRHaa	i think because you were saving for it.. you just really  set your mind on it that you would get it yourself. maybe your the independent type. but look on the bright side he's very thoughtful for getting it for u :D|`|tI0rkxeuaa	It's just a phone.  Get over it!    The way you've worded your question makes you sound like a spoiled brat that wants everything her way.    You may want to grow up a bit.|`|EdidZdtlaa	because your jealous and you want the same phone. thats why you mad because you want it. youll get over it.|`|I1wVybUYaa	cuz your jealous of course. plus your probabily annoyed at him or being so thoughtless|`|eHfEh85zaa	sorry hun your jealous maybe he wants to bug yuh|`|WgIZUcYfaa	You shouldn't be mad....I believe the correct word would be jealous. You are jealous.    If you are mad...you are selfish.|`|YEUrDkPFaa	Your mad because,since you wanted a cellphone so bad,and you see your bf getting one,you feel jealous.And the iphone is pretty popular now in these days,so I can see why.Man I love the Iphone! I want it too!      (What mean comments they post you)     :)|`|Xo0gWfBAaa	Jealousy is straight from the devil.You see how it makes you feel. Don't let satan win. Be happy for your bf and keep saving for YOUR phone. It will make you feel proud that you earned it.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Because you're a  spoilt brat? suck it up|`|JWZEuuhTaa	I would say because he knew that you wanted it and that you have been working for it. I think he wanted ti get you jealous & mad at him. You should keep saving. But if you want to get pay back you can get something that he wants, and get the Iphone that you wanted. So you are happy.|`|F5R3TJEQaa	why didnt he buy you one?  whata cheapo|`|oe81XFO0aa	because he knew you wanted it...or your'e just mildly jealous|`|aQ8utQOeaa	because it is kind of like a slap in the face|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Yer jealous and wish he'd have bought it for you....|`|SLTlvqRlaa	Jealous!|`|U8R2o1P3aa	I know what you mean! I have the lg V (before the enV) and whenever i see people with their nice new phones, i get SO jealous lol.  Well just use his iPhone whenever you can lol, hes your boyfriend, thats what hes there for|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Not sure why you're mad. Jealousy?    I'm not sure what your relationship is or if you live together, but... it's not his responsibility to buy you a cell phone. That's an expensive investment. I know a lot of people who bought cell phones for their past boyfriends/girlfriends and it got ugly when they broke up.|`|XPzdqiC0aa	Maybe its because you have been working hard to earn the money and he seemed to have it on hand.. ? Maybe your angry because he didnt buy it for you? (which is not fair because its his money)...|`|JQ3Ibj9xaa	because you wanted to have an iphone before him, but he beat you to it  and you wanted to be the only one with the iphone  but now ur not  and now your jealous ;)  i would be too|`|0Ok61oMcaa	maybe b/c you wanted to get something that you earned... or you didn't like the spontaneousness about it idk?|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Your bf is selfish and you are right to be mad
iMplzgBtaa	All of the receptions I've been to that had buffets had cheese, meat, veggie and fruit trays, bowls of crackers, some kind of spread like an artichoke/spinach dip, beef or chicken kabobs.  You can buy the trays and crackers from your local supermarket and cut them up yourself.  You can get inexpensive trays at dollar stores or wal-mart.  Most large supermarkets have delis that have chicken strips, bites or popcorn chicken, they usually have popcorn shrimp that is very reasonable.  You could do a salad, pasta salad and fruit salad that you make yourself.  You can get mini quiches, mini pigs in blankets and cocktail wieners at the supermarket.  You could probably do steak or chicken kabobs yourself too and just rent some warming trays.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We were in the same boat - keep things simple, but yummy - then your decoration/presentation can reflect any style you want.  We had Baron of beef, roast turkey, baked ham; baby roasted potatoes; hot mixed veggies; a variety of salads - garden, Caesar, potato, coleslaw, macaroni, marinated, etc.; veggie and fruit trays; cheeses, pickles, buns; a variety of dainties.|`|G1boIrFuaa	I would contact different caterers and ask about an appetizer buffet.  Prices vary widely depending on which caterer and the types of food.  Most grocery stores also offer party trays, which someone could set up for you in the reception hall.  Try to avoid preparing anything yourselves.  You would have to do most of the work in the few days before the wedding, and you want to be as relaxed as possible then!|`|u4910BFfaa	Lasagna and chicken.  For real.  Everyone likes one or the other and they are cheap.  The lasagna you can even do yourself in large pans for much less than a caterer.  Chicken is always good because everyone likes it.
QIQNzE11aa	Ok... i am mildly confused. You state your name as Helen but call yourself a dad. Hmm.     A dad can fight to keep his child in the same state. Will normally win as well. A parent cannot just pick up and move the child out of state. has to be some big reasons to even try to get to move that far. Spite will not win out in court.     You can fight for more than just visitation. You can fight for joint custody. This means you can have the kids more than just weekends. You can have a judge regulate how often the child can be at the dad's if the mom is working to keep the child away from the dad. She can also be forced to take "children in the middle" classes and even counseling if she insists on using the child as a weapon.     Father's have just as many rights. You won't look good in a court of law if you are not legally separated and not divorced while having  a girlfriend. Put the relationship on hold until you are actually single.|`|AA11967247	it is likely she can do that even if you "finish" your current relationship.  look at your court/custody order, some specify how far the custodial parent is allowed to move before the courts and/or yourself allows it.|`|EBi7Ci6taa	she can try but it doesn't mean she will be successful.  if she can prove your girlfriend is a harmful influence to your child (which may be hard) she will get her way.  be careful who you associate with during this time, your child should come before any other relationship.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Fortunately for you she cannot move if you have a custody agreement.

You can stop her from moving.|`|syWS4ep1aa	You lose your right to put yourself first the moment you have a child. Do what's best for him.
uvWuVWb1aa	Ruth is right. CoverTn may be an option, but it's highly unlikely. And no, the state will NOT come after you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	That's not how it works.  I doubt he can even put your son on TennCare if he isn't the primary parent.  Call TennCare or DCSE and ask.    If he is self-employed, CoverTN might be available, but I don't know much about that one.|`|EBi7Ci6taa	If he isn't the custodial parent I don't think he can get medicaid for your son.  You on the other hand can, and they will go after him for everything they have to pay out in medical for your son.  I would suggest you sign him up for coverage, all states have it now for uninsured children.|`|ByUS0k8waa	The state will not come after you for repayment! They will go after him. If he is the one court ordered to cover him. My ex has never once carried insurance on my daughter and was suppose to from the beginning. They have never bothered to go after him and I was told they wouldn't go after me since he is the one who is failing to be a good parent and do what the court ordered of him.     However, since your probably not getting your child support they will go after him for that. At least they keep track of it with my daughter since I had to put her on medicaid. She is now eligible for tricare thank goodness.
v1unVqYqaa	I'm shy too.  Depending on what age you are, bring up topics like twilight, the clothes she is wearing.  Whats your favorite class....  Ask her if you sit with her at lunch.

I don't get how a person could not like someonee though, just because they are nice. If someone says "Hello" to you, just say hi back, and play it cool.

As for the bikini area, trim it and just shave the edges clean (you could even do a heart shape if you wanna get really festive) but brazilian shaves feel like 5 o'clock shadows- ruff and stubbly, so I'd just not if I were you, unless you want to get a wax (but ouch!)

Maggie also comes up with another great idea. It would be great if Ted and Courtney renewed their vows also. They're close friends and it would be great to share this in that way.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	I've never known you to back away from a challenge?    Carpe diem, my friend...or come hide in my cabin?|`|GX41UJDiaa	With the right accessory collar you could pretend to be the Vicar......then again that didn't stop Hattie.|`|V0CV4TJpaa	Your conductor will keep unwanted guest from you.

Look at it this way.....if we get tired of her antics, we simply toss her off ....Like "Throw Mamma from the Train"    As for these re-newals....I think Ted and Courtney should be re-taking since they had such confusion in Vegas. I'm not even sure if they are really married in the first place,|`|Cjof0OLtaa	since no one has ever met this twin sister, why judge her based on her sister's wild behavior?  there is a very good chance that she doesn't act like her sister. twins may share the same dna (if they are identical, that is) but that doesn't mean they have the same personality.      i suggest you be nice to her and get to know her.  i fyour were in her shoes, you would not want people judging you based on, let's say, your family member's uncouth ways.|`|EyCeBkUaaa	I can hide you under my skirt if you would like
sQBcIcAnaa	Because men and women are different when it comes to feelings your talking night and day     For an example some guys "fall in lust"or what you might call and Obsession falling in lust how can i describe it hmmmm....   its kinda like the kid in the store that throws a tantrum for a toy or candy he cries he screams and pleads  about how bad he wants this toy or candy  but once hes at home with his own toys he hardly remembers  what his fit was all about.   Do you understand that ?    If not then here is a simpler version  he lied and he just wasn't all that into you ok why did he lie?  maybe he just wanted sex from you or to use you to get to some Else he had his eyes on other words it wasn't TRUE LOVE FOR HIM JUST A GAME     you should learn to read men and know the difference between love and lust|`|klkt1LvSaa	he probally likes a differnt girl or three different girls.. i am so sorry for you the same thing happened to me :(|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	The only way you will ever know is to ask him.

If he's honest about it, he'll tell you.|`|onGWYMcjaa	I was going to ask the same thing but to girls...|`|QMeForAGaa	um wow  not all guys r like that first of all  but anyway its just for us guys the spark can die  (hard to explain)  to him a space grew  or he found sum1else  its just the way things r  im soooooooo sorry  but thats how sum guys work|`|TwxlXbGsaa	Must I always be waiting, waiting on yoooouuuu.|`|sZSGDDcYaa	Lol, I think almost every person has had this with one of their partners before. Through my experience I find that mostly if you don't talk to them for a while a gap opens and it never closes. In my case that gap opened and the man I was with, moved on. It sucks yes, but not all men are like that. :) So don't worry it will get easier and chances are you will find a man who will love you unconditionally. Sometimes forgetting the worst memories as painful as they allow better and more full-filling memories in!    Good Luck! :)|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Becuase we get tired of waiting! Playing hard to get, or just not liking a guy are factors. I mean what, we're supposed to wait for you? C'mon!|`|3griQEMAaa	ok i'm a girl and i went through the same thing! I don't get it either!! I don't see why they do that though|`|xbMLtXOuaa	well, he probably didnt really love you in the first place, and there might be someone else|`|aZBDU75zaa	awee gurll i feel so bad for you, gooodluck hun !!!|`|CaKu7gbAaa	Might be he won't be true to you before also, what he was opposing in front of you about his true love, they might be just words and talks from his side. Now when he has got fed up or or he can't oppose any more with his false love he must have found someone else to ditch, he came to you and said I am sorry and moved his way without giving you any reason because he is selfish and he is not worth for you. He has given lots of pain to your true love and sentiments.Please don't be upset, don't remember such kind of selfish men. If some guy is true in his feels and for his love he will never leave his love lady. He will always stand through thick and thin.     If you want to be with him now also, you can just make one last try for the sake of your love, give him call and talk to him once and ask him why he has took this kind of initiative. Say him that you love him truly and he also did so we should get along together again. If he doesn't understand your feelings again, then you wont cry and let him know in reality he doesn't deserves you and your true love. Leave this selfish man and never waste your tears for such kind of guys.    Enjoy your life and make more good friends, surely will get the one who really respects true love and sentiments with sincerity.

Make them clear better not to disturb you or you can let them if you will not change then you have to talk with some one like your dad or teacher or their parents or any mature and sensible person with whom you feel comfortable and then let that person to talk to them and make them understand. or without letting the boys know you can ask any of your elder to deal with them in a sensible manner.    I think you should help of some mature person if they don't change.    Hope it helps
9kRW3Awdaa	WALL OF TEXT ATTACK! If this is all true... I don't know what to say I have never had a girlfriend. Sad isn't it cheer me up now
auUeI2Vnaa	Focus on your career and getting your kids through school at this point...if a relationship (with a GOOD guy) falls in your lap, take it, otherwise, just worry about you and your kids.|`|nqINitkmaa	re -phrase your question... I don't understand what you are asking.|`|u4910BFfaa	I think worrying about being in a relationship is what got you into the situation of having two kids by the age of 18.  I would worry more about my children and getting ahead in life rather than worrying about finding a man.  Harsh, but true.  If my daughter had two by the age of 18 I would slap her for crying about not having a man!!  You will find a relationship when the time comes.  At 18 with two kids you dont need to worry about getting a boyfriend.  Worry about getting and keeping a job and taking care of your kids!|`|odqVRHS3aa	Well your question is a bit confusing but I had twins at the age of 17 and have been in so many relationships. I got married a few years ago and divorced and I just got married again over the summer to the love of my life. So it doesn't matter that you had kids early you are going to find the right person.|`|quTryvngaa	You have enough baggage w/the two kids and being only 18. However, you can turn that into a positive. Focus on becoming a better woman and mother. Get yourself established and decide on a career so that anyone that comes into your life knows that you are a strong and confident woman who can make it on her own. Don't be dependent on anyone but yourself. Establish a good support family (i.e. family, close friends). Trust me when I say that you are young and have your entire life for relationships. However, considering the fact that you have two children, you need to be very careful with whom you decide to introduce them to.    You are a jewel and should be treated as such. Don't settle for less. Good things come to those who wait. God bless and may you always have positive energies in your life.|`|AA11380378	Kinda late for thinking about that.     You should be thinking about getting an education (obviously you need it) other than to be thinking about spreading your legs again and poping more yungns out.    It's too late. No one wants a a teenager with that kind of baggage. There are plenty of ladies that are marriage material, I'm afraid to say that you are not.    Sorry.    Good luck|`|aD7kHTJNaa	can u re-type that.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Choose a different place to get married at|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	Definitely talk to her.  You need to find out now if you have to change your venue.   When you do speak to her, make it clear to her that you have no desire to see your friends drive drunk and kill themselves either. maybe you could put your heads together and come up with a plan to prevent "bad" drunken behaviour? Such as talking to the people that will be serving the drinks and let them know you are happy for them to slow down the service of anyone who is causing trouble.. or perhaps you could organise a bus to pick everyone up from one location adn drop them home again so they don't have to drive?|`|G1boIrFuaa	Definitely you need to confront her.  Find out NOW while you still have time, instead of her changing her mind last minute.  If she does change her mind now, it sucks, but at least you still have a few months to change things around.  Explain to her that you have made deposits already, and her changing the venue would cost you a lot more money in the long run.|`|hMavMBo4aa	I would look for a new place ASAP.  These thoughts are warranted and will not go away.  It is unfortunate that you heard through the grapevine.  That was wrong of her to offer, before she considered all of the responsibilities that went along with it.  Is there a church or outdoor facility you can have the reception with the same vendors?  You have time, so start looking around to make the necessary changes.|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Definetly talk to her!|`|MVaIw9fjaa	wedding always are scary  but don tgive up  everything will be ok|`|odqVRHS3aa	I would definitly talk to her about this. Its better to know way in advance where your wedding is going to be. Good luck|`|sMUiGFPraa	You could always get a back up location. That way you can still use the services you have already reserved. Or another idea is to ease her make it a no alcohol reception. You can't blame her for feeling that way A lot of people do stupid things. If you insist on alcohol just do a toast and wine with dinner, no hard liquor or beer.|`|d463fe7e1693b502adb816944612a0e8aa	Depending on the laws where you live, she could possibly be held liable if. as the property owner, she allows someone to drive drunk and they have an accident.  To relieve her of this liability, rent the property for $1 for the day, with a written contract making you the 'host' of the party.  Even still, if someone falls and breaks their leg on her property, they can sue her.    Severely limit the booze &/or hire some college kids as 'chauffeurs' to safely drive anyone who drinks too much home.    It's not going to get any easier to host a party!  A drunk shouldn't drive, but the % allowed is beginning to be ridiculous.    Congratulations|`|X6YY0OS6aa	I wouldn't want to put someone out...sure, she should be upfront with you to make things easier on you but she may be a little scared to take it back.  I would just do it somewhere else..|`|AA11380378	I hate to tell you. but your aunt is right.    She needs insurance for the wedding as she could be held liable if someone gets injured in her property. Also, they are fire code regulation for the amount of cars that could be park on the street at any given time, and how many people can she have inside her house safely.     If I was you, PAY to have your wedding at a place where you won't get to put your relatives on the spot. It will cause a lot of trouble in the family may something goes missing from her house, something gets broken or if the police gets called to her house for disturbing the peace. What would happen if her lawn gets damaged? Who would pick up the mess the day after? Who would clean the bathrooms after all the drunks are done trowing up? You aunt?    As an alternative, you can tell your aunt that you will hire a professional cleaning crew the day after and that you will have a dry wedding with the exception of a champagne toast. This will set her mind at ease, I'm sure and it's the bare minimum that you can do.    Good luck
qgWW4tFyaa	well since you're confused, i wouldn't date either one. first of all its really unfair to your boyfriend, he's devoting all of his feelings for you and you're only half there. plus think about this: if he was doing this to you would you like it? probably not. so don't date either of them until you're sure, because you're confusion makes them confused too and its not fair.|`|esbs4tPSaa	Either way you are going to break someone's heart. And well, like you said they both have their traits you admire and faults/things they do, that you aren't or don't do.    If you are in this situation, then if you choose your bf, the ex will stay be there for you and still be your friend, but if you choose the ex, then he will become your bf and your bf turned ex might be very broken hearted.    It is your choice, but you don't have the freedom to take your sweet time since this is tearing you apart. Good luck tho.|`|dy7aFbhqaa	You can't put them on a scale like the weights in a law scale.  You need to seriously spend some time with some peaceful music, and think it over.  Find out which your heart loves.  Remember you are already with a wonderful man by the way.  You need to be able to move on from here to find hapiness with someone|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are looking for a singular method of resolving which one is most suitable for you, merely ask yourself this question:  which one is most "helpful" to you.  Again, pass on the romantic quality, the good looks, the manner of chasing, the charm, etc. which can be found in various forms.  So, which of your two boyfriends [the current bf and the ex-bf] has that singular quality of being "helpful?"  "Helpfulness" should be the key quality above all other character traits which will bode you well with any lasting future relationship.    Good luck!|`|zprAkP3eaa	Follow your heart, we all make decisions we regret.
AW1dCzH0aa	Hello!  Don't panic - everything is going to be fine!      Start with a venue.  I think that's the most important.  If you are looking for somewhere inexpensive, think about local community centers, parks, botanical gardens and such.      Food - I'd skip the food.  Have your wedding at a time when people aren't expecting to be fed.  If you have the wedding at 2:00 - a cake and punch reception will be just fine.  You can even do some finger foods if you must (shrimp cocktail from local costco).    Cake - go to a local culinary school.  Put up a flier asking for students who may be interested in making your wedding cake.  You could likely get a beautiful cake from someone on their way to being a professional.  Or you can skip the fancy wedding cake and just order a really really beautiful sheet cake from your local grocery store.  You can buy or make a really beautiful cake stand to put it on (check out Martha Stewart's wedding site - she'll tell you how to make a gorgeous cake stand).      Dresses - go to Target!  They have some super cute bridesmaid/flower girl dresses.  Or even craigslist.com and ebay.  You'll be surprised what's out there.      Your hair and makeup - call your local beauty school and see if there are any talented students who would want to do your updo.  You may even be able to talk to the instructor about being her guinea pig... with supervision by the instructor.  Just a thought!      Oh and your invites should not be going out 6 months before the wedding.  That is way too soon!  It should be more like 3 months before the wedding... you don't want people to forget to RSVP if it's too far out!  Hope this all helps!|`|Y5tuYa1Baa	get a life|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Why aren't your maid of honor, bridesmaids, best man, and groomsmen paying for their dresses and tuxedos? That's normally how it goes. The ring bearer and flower girl parents pay for their tuxedo and dress as well. You shouldn't have to pay for all of that... you have enough to pay for.  Also, you don't send out wedding invitations until about 2, maybe 3 months before the wedding. Unless the invites you are talking about are the "save the date" invites.. then those will go out about now and then you send the real wedding invitations about 2 months before. You shouldn't really send it after 2-3 months though because that does not give the guests enough time to find out what they're wearing, ask off for work if needed, buy the wedding present(s), etc.  I would think about what you don't really need at the wedding and spend money on other things you need.  Food, for instance, you can just get your parents (if they're helping) to make some finger foods.. or you can get your friends to help you with it... if they can't help you, you can easily just go to a deli and get some finger foods there and that'd be a lot cheater than a caterer.|`|nKCKSVWsaa	save money|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	invites don't go out unit about 6-8 weeks before the wedding, sending them out this early, people will forget. Are you paying for everyone's tux yourself? Why aren't they helping out? When I got married my groomsman covered the cost of their own tuxes.    Your going to have to look over and see what you really want to keep in your budget and do away with stuff. It's a bullet to bite but remember your guests are there to see you get married not what you served.|`|AA11380378	Venue:    -Try a local park or garden  -Friends/relative backyard  -YMCA  -Elk's lodge  -VFW hall  -Church fellowship hall  -Community hall room    Tuxes:   The GM pay fr their own tuxes, so you only have to pay for one (your HTB). If you can't still comeup with the money; I suggest you tell the GM and groom to wear a dark suit instead.    Ring bearer and Jr. BM    -Let them wear sunday's best or last year's Easter outfits.   -Go to a consigment shop, Good will, other motheres, ebay, craiglist and search for used bargains    -Food  Do Cake and toast and light appetizers at a non-meal time. Mid afternoon, or mid morning or late at night (after 7 after peope have alerady eaten at home)    Good luck and congrats|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Elope, it has worked for us for over 30 years.  Use your money for a down payment on a house. Later you will be so glad that you did.  Elope and have a reception later. Costs less and a whole lot less stress. See, the wedding is in Sept and you are already stressing.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	hate to say this but you're in trouble here. Food for my wedding is costing $1500 and I'm using the cheapest reputable caterer in my area. You didn't say where you are so none of us can really give you any really helpful advice.  Contact your local council for venues they should have a list of venues thaat can be hired out, work your way through that list contacting everyplace on it for pricing. thats what I did and my ceremony venue is free (I'm using a council run park) and my reception venue is $150 with a no alcohol condition. As to the the clothing- why are you paying for it? and everything else do it yourself or get a trusted family member to do it.|`|AA11581002	Dave ramsey|`|5cBmCVw3aa	start looking at the whole picture and start cutting things what you do not need and can do without,.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Hire a Wedding Planner and give the stress to her while you save the money. Best wishes :)|`|Jf5h5OPCaa	Get a job or save money if you aren't already    and good venues are on the beach (maybe you know someone with a house on the beach) or maybe someone who has a nice house with a big backyard that would let you use it for the ceremony. And i think that most churches don't ask for too much money.|`|otYasFGHaa	dont spend sell or donate at salvation army then ask 4 a reciept and fill it out and send it in they give you money!!!|`|m13CCGc1aa	How many people are you inviting?  2000.00 is NOT much money at all.  Unless you are only inviting 20 people or plan on doing sandwiches for food, the food alone will easily take what remains of your budget.  Even a cheap cake will likely cost several hundred dollars.    Ceremony-go for a park if there is one in your area with an outside stage.  If you just go for a regular park, you will need to either rent or borrow chairs.    Also, if you are religious, a lot of churches have church recreational areas.  Maybe you could even join a church in anticipation of your upcomming wedding.  I think they are usually pretty reasonably priced.    Ask the tux wearers to rent their own tux.  Since being asked to be in a wedding is an "honor" they will likely accept.  Ask the Junior Bridesmaid's/ring bearer's parents if they would be willing to pay for their dresses own tux dresses.  Since for young children it is more of a cute factor then an "honor" tell their parents that you would accept them purchasing the dresses/tux on their own as their gift to you.    Can you borrow a friend's shoes?  Do you have any hair stylist make up artist friends who could do your hair and make up as their gift to you?    Edit:  Since you are the parent of the junior bridesmaids and others, you'll just have to look for sales.  Maybe ebay?     If none of these ideas appeal to you, get to work!  You're going to need a lot more money then what you have left.|`|207dFmdHaa	elope......theres no way you can do the food, and cake, let alone the clothes for that amount of money....if you were smart you would have a small wedding at a church and use the reception hall at the church and serve cake and punch.....the people coming in just want to see you.....is this a 2nd wedding? why so big?

Something our parents don't understand is that we may be psychologically immature at a young age, but we are also mature in other ways at the same time.    Teenagers are, chemically proven to be, impulsive, a little on the selfish side, and rebellious.    Many parents believe that if they "raise you right" you will be 100% responsible, reasonable, and a "good kid" - and this is simply not true.    Some people are born older and wiser than their physical years, others are fairly average.  What your mom needs to do is to allow you to grow at your own pace and trust that if their is a problem, you will share with her.    But she also needs to show you that you can trust her.  If you can't trust her you will keep everything from her; even the mundane and innocent.  You won't be able to make informed decisions, because their may be information she has, that you don't, and won't, because you wouldn't come to her.    Have a chat.  Be adult about it.  Don't yell or whine.  You'll prove her right. Tell her that you don't appreciate her invasions of privacy and that if she had concerns that were valid, you'd happily show her your pages so she could be assured.    On that note, change all your passwords to a string of numbers.  I use my locker + gym locker combination's from high school.    If you're under 15, in my opinion, you shouldn't have a facebook, myspace, etc. account anyway.  Email is harmless, but these places aren't created for pre-teens who will share anything with anyone (see above: impulsive).    That's my two cents.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	23 years later no matter how much i rebel mine is still the same.

Tell her if she cannot stop policing your every move, you will start doing things behind her back, which I am sure she would not like, right?|`|yN6oiDBJaa	meaning stop doing things that arent good for you and she just wants you to be safe.|`|AA12223669	It depends on how old you are. It's important to your mom that you show maturity with the internet. Very embarrassing things can happen to you via internet and she wants to make sure you're being smart. You need to prove to her that you are being smart. I would come up with a complicated password. Never write it down, but memorize it over a few days, change your e-mail address password to that and always delete internet history so she has no access whatsoever. Then create another complicated password, change all of your social site accounts to this password (so that if she hacks one, at least she can't hack another). If she asks you for the passwords, tell her no. Tell her that you deserve your privacy and that as long as she tries to invade it, you'll try to keep secrets. That you need personal space to grow into your own person without judgement and she's not letting you do this.|`|QV8cdSM1aa	well if she keeps you like that then maybe you need to talk to   her i know it may be weird but im sure you don't want to stay tied    and im pretty sure if you stayed tied up your just going to rebel  on everything she says huh?  tell her that ..|`|YdjX5fOWaa	I think it depends on how old you are.  Are you over 18?  Then I think it's an invasion of privacy.  However, if you're 14 then I say good for her for being involved.  My parents were ALWAYS in my business and it drove me crazy!  However, I grew up far better adjusted than my friends who got involved with a lot of not so good things that really changed their lives for the worse.  I know with my nephews, who are 13 and 16, they are allowed to have computer access, but their parents have to be able to see everything they are doing.  And given how many predators and horrible things people are capable these days... you're mom is just looking out for you.  You'll appreciate it one day, I promise.    Oh, and she's right about that internet stuff.  I run a University dormitory, and we facebook and myspace our students all the time to see what they are up to!  And potential employers look at that stuff and all sorts of people... nothing is private on the internet!

One who doesn't need to pick on others or trash others to feel cool, and is content with just being relaxed and fun. Not too clingy, but not too distant.   looks aren't really the key factor in what we like. it's different for everyone. Just be yourself.|`|Tf19RETiaa	i like a really nice smile, a guy who actually cares about me,  nice eyes and and a good body (average) a guy thats funny & can make me laugh, who would be there for me to help me if i needed it. a guy thats easy to talk to and just sweet in general. id like the guy to be taller than me too.    turnoffs : being really loud or immature, or teasing like too much and cussing every other word, or bad hygiene or being controlling or jealous. or a show off. or acting perverted uck =/|`|Co7BtKiPaa	any/all/even one combination of these  good fashion sense - i love emo/skater boys  nice hair - this is ESSENTIAL http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SH...  thats hot  good sense of humor- not too serious  not selfish  how they act around their friends, kind generous understanding  ability to make conversation!!!! also a must because the last boyfriend i had was the wooooorrrsssssttttt at making conversation ever, seriously talking to him was so boring =/  loyalty, this one is the most obvious|`|AA12186207	I like tall guys    Funny is a must, and he has to have some kind of brains.|`|3YsvIXZ1aa	favorite    tall  funny  cute|`|7585zXZIaa	Tall and funny.

Someone who's just comfortable with himself, and me.  I like spontinaity also, I'm very spontaneous, nothing I do is planned. lol  He MUST have good hygiene or I will absolutely DIE.  Pinky rings are NOT acceptable.  He needs to be able to carry on a conversation with me.  And he doesn't have to be the funniest guy on earth, but I like guys who make me laugh.    Oh yeah, and cussing, arrogance and being rude to people is a HUGE turn off.   Treat me like a lady.|`|rxx9ub7haa	actually i don't care what the guy looks like he's got to be funny and confident (but not to full of himself).

Funny is always good to break up an awkward situation, but can also be annoying sometimes. Smart, yes. Some common sense in him but he doesn't have to be a rocket scientist. To smart is bad to, makes the girls feel stupid.    What I dislike is when a guy plays games. He likes you, he doesn't. they're just trouble. And when he never wants to hang out alone, like he's always bringing his friends, or always invites you to hang with him and his buds and just ignores you. And I also don't like guys who wait to long to make a move. They ask you out, but don't call you for a long time. Definite turn off. :P|`|iWjKnMU4aa	i love when guys are somewhat oblivious to so many girls liking them, and when a guy is kind of awkward around a girl. to me, it doesn't mean he's inexperienced, he's just nervous, that's so adorable! i also love when a guy makes me laugh really hard, and when we can have a meaningful conversation just the two of us. i also love when he can disagree with me, and we can argue (playfully) about our different opinions. obviously, i love when guys have a nice body too! lol. but he doesn't have to have one, because if he's cute, funny, and nice, it doesn't matter at all!|`|SIwbZ2ACaa	My Original...that I love....TALL funny :^) happy and flirty ;^)  I have one guy in mind, it's been like four months...I think he likes me but he has only made like one move. Today in school, he like dropped his pencil and asked me to pick it up, so I did. Then he dropped it like 5 more times and then I said that I wasn't going to pick it up again. He has that dry sense of humor. He makes me laugh a lot! We sit next to each other at lunch, and sometimes he flirts, it's really cute. I really don't want it to go to far. I just want us to be really good friends, which we are now, but I just don't want the dating making out kind of thing right now. You know? I want to be able to do group type things. Like go to the mall or a restarant. We all have this clique of friends. Like four girls and three guys. We havent went to places together but it would be really fun...We are all such good friends. Like go to the coffeshop together...not dating, like I said, I am not up to that. And if he buys me things, that is a total plus.

5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	the best way to handle that is to tell him   when and if he breaks up with her to let you know as you then would enjoy hooking up with him.|`|AA11436717	I THINK YOU SHOULD....there was this guy i really loved! and i told him last week i loved him..n he broke up with his girl....but i think he is back with her...so it doesnt matter it would end up good or bad both ways...|`|15Zr5voMaa	just rite him a note telling him like u like him and then stick it in his locker|`|26898d87344fc67ec856f786662efe9baa	No!  Who knows for sure he will break up with her?  Would you really want to be with a guy who would dump a girl that easily?  Think about it; you could be the next one who gets dumped!|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	Would you want your friends hitting on your boyfriend, I'd think not.  Be a friend, if he ever broke up, you can be available, not clingy.|`|PPXUgYa6aa	If you like the guy alot then its okay to let him know that you like him, its only natural to feel this way toward someone you find attractive. But just make sure that if he does break up with his girlfriend its not because of the fact that he wants to get with you. That can bring alot of drama before a relationship between you and him can even start. So tell him how you feel in the friendliest way possible.|`|pdW8jMQoaa	Bad idea, and if he breaks up with her, don't immediately ask him out, he will think of you as a stalker.|`|SFteh6Mwaa	Don't tell him.    All it's going to do is hurt you,    Confuse him,    And make his girlfriend HATE you.|`|fQeS0qWWaa	no thats mean|`|AA12035186	He's not married. Go for it!!!!|`|19TSkwaKaa	BOYFRIEND STEALER! haha  im joking. yeahh tell him.  dont make out like you want something.  that will put pressure on them. just a hint will do  And make sure youre there for when/if the relationship falls apart :)|`|zh9kfW5Eaa	Absolutely not. Put yourself in the girlfriends shoes. If you were her, would you like another girl going up to him and saying so? I don't think so. If they do break up then think about it. But not while they are with someone.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	under no circumstances do you owe it to you or him to tell him.   think of his gf. how do you think she feels?     and if you really like him that much youll want him to be happy. if that means its with her, then let him be|`|yFvdXRPBaa	If I was a guy I would want to know, and I would probably start thinking about the girl who told me and would be curious to know who she is and why she likes me.  This would probably upset the girlfriend I would have but I would be intrigued to find out more about this other girl.    If you tell him, he will obviously reject you because he has a girlfriend so be prepared for that because it can hurt.  Remember it is probably best to tell him than go on thinking "what if".    Good Luck :)|`|UY4P6UFxaa	no dont be a home wrecker. just wait till they split then he is all yours. cause if you think about it, would you want some girl to tell your bf they like him?|`|6wNbnZNKaa	tell him a week after he broke up with his current gf|`|qIaBOtltaa	Don't tell him anything unless he breaks up with his g/f FIRST. you do not want to be known as the boyfriend stealer! Also what if you tell him and he doesn't like you that way? Then you will feel embarrassed.|`|PIxJ1Ljgaa	So you'd want to go out with a guy who dumps his current gf to date you? What does that say about his integrity?|`|UvcH4cneaa	Nopee. Because if you do, then maybe u will get in problems with his girl. Oh and if he doesnt feel the same way as you, and you tell him that u like him. He might feel wierd around you, so i wouldn't!!!|`|5QAh0gsoaa	No i would say dont tell him because you wouldent want him trying to get with u while he is dating the other girl|`|4fikqmnUaa	no just tell him if he breaks up with her. You should leave him.|`|PQjPq6Ddaa	Yes, you should basically tell him that you know he is with whoever he is with but that you like him... Because if you do not then maybe he may be with that girl forever, really wanting  you, because he was afraid you would reject him, and then she wont take him back...|`|FLaYSTygaa	If you feel a certain way for someone...tell that person as soon as possible, dont listen to what the people above are saying because no one not even you can change the way u feel about a person or anything for that matter...and say by chance you do end up telling him and you do end up together...i wish the best of luck, but if it doesnt work out..dont worry about it. Atleast you tried. Dont hide your feelings or it will just annoy you even more..let it out. Dont be scared or ashamed.     .   No matter what happens in the end, its all about you. No one can tell you differently.  Just stay positive and keep your head high.  Its its meant to be its meant to be, period.|`|56esG8Yqaa	no dont tell him. hint on it though....just not too much. and make his g/f      you. that's what i did :) and now i'm going out with him...but i didn't flirt with him. we were friends and i was there for him when they broke up..and he started hitting on me...then he asked me if i liked him and i said yes and he asked me out and i said yes..just give him time..be a good friend..work your way to the top :)    good luck =]|`|eIEn5yQLaa	Well i think u should tell him cause alot of guys really lik to know who liks them even if they have a gf. i think u should tell him cause maybe him and his gf are havin a bad relationship and maybe he really liks u but cause he has a gf hedoesn'tt want 2 seem lik a player or a cheater.|`|AdTnizwOaa	I would wait. That would be sort of interfering with his girlfriend and him. Think about it, how would you feel if a girl came up to your boyfriend and told him she likes him? :) Go out and talk to other guys to keep him off your mind. If that doesn't work, be patient.|`|SRZza0cWaa	yeah tell him honey... it feels good to get things like this off your chest.. just dont worry about anything.. just tell him how you feel.  i did and he asked why i didnt tell him sooner am sure he'd be glad to know.. dont worry about his GF.. its not like their married or anything.. hope this helps....xxxxx
CA9OFT4Waa	he probably still has feelings for her because if they were together for that long something must have been there, he likes you theres no doubt but he will have an emotional tie to her for a little while but as you two date more and more he will slip away from her and grow closer to you, just don't dwell on it about it to him, but you probably should tell him you feel weird when he talk about her to you. good luck!|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	You are fine as long as he doesnt start talking to her again you should be fine. If he is still talking and trying to have some form of relationship with her then thats a sign that his feelings for her are still very strong and he wont be able to fully love you if his heart is still with her. Nothing against you its just that they have history together. If you were in her spot and she was in yours it would be the same scenario|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	well it depends if he just mentioned her once or twice and it was just a quick thing then don't worry. also are you mentioning your ex's. if you are then he might think that you are okay with that. my thought is that he still is a little physically attracted to her, but then he likes your personality better. plus boys always have like 10 girls who they think are soo beautiful.|`|8MNz8o0Laa	Alright well obviously he is not over his ex if they were dating for two years. The first mistake was that he broke up with her for you. Second you guys rushed into it. I wouldn't be surprised if he still has feelings for her. Also don't bring her up cuz that will make him think about her as well.    My advice maybe tell him you were not ready and get to know eachother better and give him time.|`|W4qKyansaa	i think he may go back to the other girl b/c he has had a lot of time and expirience with her, and the fact that he is talking about her looks and such says he isn t over her|`|sDuIOUu1aa	Unfortunately. Seeing he was with her for two years. could be two things. One: He wants to make her jealous and he found a girl who really likes him. or Two: He was waiting for an opportunity to get out of bad relationship and that was you :)|`|VYGHiQuyaa	I think he likes her more than you.
QIQNzE11aa	Go to classes for dog training. Your dog should not have to live in the back yard and in many cases you can be fined if the dog does not have good living conditions.     You all need to learn how to be a dog owner. Many pet stores offer free class or two to get you started, then you sign up and pay for the more extensive classes. Get every book and every video on it as well. If you retrain your dog, and a dog can be retrained at any age. I just retrained a really bad dog who was 8 1/2 years... now he's the best dog ever!     Once you retrain the animal, it can be a very good family addition.     Often men will sieze on one thing and hold on for dear life. They often feel that they always give up what they want. If you look around your house, exactly how much of it is your husbands taste? Not your taste, but what your husband would pick out if you were not there. does he have one area that is all his and can be gaudy and overtly male? How often does he win out when he wants something? Especially when something else is always needed.     He's not going to give up the dog and your fighting about it will only make him hold on even more. Sometimes, men do chose the dog over the wife. You say your new husband... so you need to make some choices here. First, start with learning how to be a dog owner and getting a well trained dog. Embrace the dog and tell him you want him with you for ever class. This will do one of two things. Either he'll hate taking time out for the dog and finally want to get rid of it... i doubt it. Or you two can bond while learning how to manage your dog and making it a good part of your family. making a stronger marriage and a fun playmate for kids and self.     Next, find a space that can be just your husbands. Anything he wants to do in there. I mean anything. My husbands space has a clark that actually makes fart noises. I hate it and would like to smash it to a billion little pieces. But... it makes him smile. I think he almost gets as much pleasure that i hate it so much as he does hearing it go off. He has other things i cannot stand as well. I invite him to help me pick colors. Not.. hey i like these few which do you like. But actually, which colors would they like for any room. To help make it his home ad not just yours. My husband has a garage and a room that's his. The room he has for games and his art work. It's fun for him to be in there at times, yet it also makes him want to spend more time with me. Everything in my house has started out with his input from the beginning. He likes his home, it's not fru fru as he calls it. nor is it masculine. It's a nice compromise that we both enjoy.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Go to Obedience school with your dog.  You will both learn a lot, and the dog will be happier.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Sounds like the sog has destroyed alot of your things. Has the dog destroyed anything that belongs directly to your husband? If not, then perhaps something should be 'left out' on accident that belongs to your husband, something that would make him realize how much of a pain this dog is. Or you could always leave the gate open, and he could 'wonder off'.....     Just saying.....|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Sorry, I side with your husband on this one.  Either get training for the dog or just let your husband keep spending money on the repairs.  You can not expect your husband to get rid of the dog.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	tell your husband if he wants to keep the dog then he needs to train it.    go to you local pet store and enroll him and the dog in obedience classes if he refuses then find a good home for the dog.    If you haven't had children w/ this man already then you may want to rethink this marriage.  He doesn't sound grown up enough or sane enough to be married and have a family or even a dog.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Sent him to prison for few days so he can man up!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You married a child.     This is a child.     I'm sorry, but there is nothing you can do about it. You married a child and now, you're going to have to be a patient mother rather than a wife.    Stick it out till the kids are out and then move on.     Good Luck!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Open the back gate and let him free :) Maybe let both of them free lol..|`|dRj9FoHzaa	If your husband treats the dog as his son, then you should treats him like the dog.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Well your husband is being a little silly.    But for the sake of peace.  Start a training program with the dog.  Watch Cesar Milan the dog whisperer on the history channel.    Get him some chew toys (a kong chew toy filled with treats or peanut butter) and take him on long walks to run off that pent up energy.    Buy bitter apple to prevent him from chewing unwanted items.  Good Luck|`|TEhdnSdhaa	I do not know want type of your husband is, my husband chose football over family you know what I told him, if the team cooks or will be  there for you when you are in hospital then I will be gone so that you get the team to be there for not your family.   He has better respect now than ever|`|IvMPh09baa	well... just getting rid  of the dog is cruel, dogs are animals and requiree training and patience.  What kind of a person are you that you just want to get rid of a helpless dog??? Seriously...     I suggest you sign up for some obedience courses, research training techniques online and get yourself some more information about how to discipline a dog appropriately and not just giving them up.  Thats so cruel.  I am a big animal lover, and have my own puppy that destroys things in the house.  They can do this for several reasons, but mostly because the dog is bored or angry at you.  Try taking him for long walks or runs and challenging his mind by playing with them.   A good dog is a worn out dog, if you wear the dog out and get him physcially active he won't have the energy to destroy everything at your house.    please go check out your local spca website and find more information.  im sure he is a great dog and has the potential to behave.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It's shameful to get a dog and then let it be a bad dog. They must be trained. You also need a crate the dog can lie down comfortably in to leave him in when you aren't there to supervise him. This is how you prevent the chewing.     If your husband won't take responsibility for training, you or your son are going to have to. Take the dog to Obedience Classes, read some books. Did you have your son and then just expect him to know everything without your guidance? Of course not.    Re: your husband, I'm afraid you married a loser. There's counseling for that, but it's not as effective as dog training. :)|`|uvWuVWb1aa	He isn't choosing your family over the dog, he is just choosing to keep the dog although it damages the property and household items. Tell him you will get rid of the dog unless he takes it to obedience class. It's in a puppy phase which he will eventually grow out of, and when he does he'll quit chewing on things. Until then, obedience class and no-chew spray is all you can do. The spray is really cheap and most dogs hate the taste of it, so they quit chewing on everything.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Train the dog.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	If he wants to keep the dog, make him take it to an obedience school.  The dog can almost certainly be trained to not rip everything to pieces.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Find that one thing that your husband personally cherishes the most, then let the dog play with it.|`|RtkB46peaa	How is it that you think your husband is choosing the dog over his family?  Because you disagree with him about the dog, doesn't mean he's choosing it over the family.  Do you often draw these crazy conclusions, and how does your family deal with it?    And it's just being a dog.  They chew, they destroy stuff, and then they grow out of it. A bit of training may help.      And 'What do you do?'  Well, you honor the commitment you both made to taking care of the dog.  It's a terrible lesson to teach your children that they can just get rid of an animal because it's more work then expected.  Are you trying to raise a quitter?|`|7YJs0Gs7aa	get the dog some training.  is it a pup an grow out of it or is it already grown an your screwed.  Lol.  I went through that with our dog but he learned.  good luck. get the dog some training.|`|nBQeSu2faa	Before you do anything with the dog..your husband needs to know...the needs of a dog. If the dog is not getting long walks everyday and other forms of exercise that will him use up all his energy..then of course the dog is going to wreck the place. If he wants to have a dog as part of the family..then he needs to treat the dog as part of the family. Would he leave his child locked up for hours and hours. You need to make your husband understand the responsibilities of having a do.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Your pup needs obedience training.  Dogs do not just automatically know how to be have they need to be trained either at home or by a professional and it takes time.  Labs do take well to training which is a bonus, we have a lab mix who has taken very well to at home obedience training, and a rottie mix whom took better to more structured professional training.  You need to be consistent and structured in your training.      Animals really do become part of the family, so I can see why your husband would have trouble letting him go, but without training it wont get better, if he/you arent willing to train the dog, then you either have to deal with a misbehaving dog, or convince him to send a dog to a family who will take the time to train him.|`|Mp4P2ewtaa	go to dog obiedience classes take the dog too if you think it necessary|`|KOX2J7uXaa	It's definitely time to have a sit down family discussion about this situation because it's not healthy for the dog or you! While I understand your husband's feelings are the dog is a member of the family too, things cannot continue on this way for the sake of the dog. No, if you had a child with problems you wouldn't get rid of them...but you would do whatever it took to get him the treatment/care he needed to live a healthy life I'm sure. Is your husband willing to spend the money this dog is in desperate need of for professional training and vet cost? If your husband's answer is no then it isn't fair to keep the dog. For you keeping this dog means a risk for very expensive surgery when he becomes impacted(which he no doubt will eventually.) from eating anything and everything he gets ahold of. Keeping this dog means you risk county fines when animal control picks him up running loose after jumping the fence. It means accepting the cost to have the dog neutered (if he isn't already) to control his desire to wander and chewing frustration. It means investing the money to have a professional trainer work with you and the dog on dealing with his problems. If your husband cannot make that commitment then it is not right for the dog to stay!  Your husband can't just keep the dog out back and refuse to deal with the issues. If he wants to keep this dog he has to take responsibility for it!
ZkmFoiobaa	Give her time and tell her you are there for her when she is ready.    You must have put alot of pressure on her to make her tell you about that.    Not sure about your ages, if very young and you are worried why not speak to one of your parents for advice
qZcd1OjNaa	Tell her how you feel, or find another girl. You know if you do or did have sex, you can get a disease i think. That's plain wrong, you don't kiss your sister. Maybe if she was your step sister it would be okay but you are in deep sh*t!!|`|JlDcVTVsaa	You should definitely talk to a psychologist about this.    And never do that again, you are hurting both yourself and your sister.
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand.      mine cost $1600 but it has a larger center stone with three smaller stones on each side, and stones lining half the band.       what you can do, since you do know what she is after, go around to the jewelery stores in your area, and ask them if you can set up a wish list.  they will put down all the rings you pick out on a list in their computer and that way you can shop around, and keep track of all the prices and find one that fits her style, AND your budget.      try smaller jewelery stores too.  like, little mom and pop type places, not huge chain stores.  they sometimes offer better warrenties and lower prices.        also, make sure you completly understand the warrenty inside and out.  make sure you know what they will replace, what they will clean, what they can size, and all that.|`|nqINitkmaa	My fiance payed a lot for mine(around $10k). But you can get away with spending about $2k I think, it depends on what you want and your budget of course. Either way she will be happy with it, it comes from you and its symbolizes spending your lives together! Congrats!!!    Edit- Wait until you are older.|`|iMplzgBtaa	There is no set costs on how much to spend.  It doesn't even have to be a diamond.  Some women prefer colored gems instead of diamonds.  Mine is blue topaz with diamond accents.  If your gf is a diamond kind of gal then get her a diamond.  You should know from any other jewelry she wears or has admired if she likes big stones or smaller ones.  Sometimes you can get a smaller stone in an elaborate setting for less than a single stone of larger size.  A one carat or 1/2 carat is reasonable as long as it is good quality and has sparkle to it.  Honestly I would recommend you go to an outlet store or even a store like wal-mart and look at what they have to offer because you will pay much less of a markup than you will at a jewelry store.  We did that and I found a ring that I fell in love with that cost around $300.  I later saw the exact same ring in a jewelry store for $700.  Since I chose a colored gem instead of a diamond I was able to get a ring with a total carat weight of 3 carats for about the same price as a 1/4 carat diamond ring.|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	Well you can get a decent one for a couple hundred. If she has expensive taste it can get pretty pricey. I saw a beautiful white gold diamond ring for $250 in a kmart ad Sunday.|`|AA11380378	My husband spend 10k on mine, It's stunning. When I get it cleaned, the people at the jewelry store always comment on the quality of the diamond and ask me how much did he paid for it and how much it is appraised/insured for. I'm very proud of it.    Good luck|`|HWiuRgNxaa	i was blessed with an heirloom and it has the best quality (no bubbles)  i am not sure how much they cost though.but its not the size that matters. but try and put a ring on layaway. im not sure about the nicer stores but i know for a fact that you can put rings on layaway at j.c.penny. and they are pretty.|`|Wrxa4vK6aa	Whatever you can realistically afford without financing it or putting a financial strain on yourself.    And because questions like this usually get a lot of idiots saying there is a two- or three-months' salary rule: that's entirely BS. The "rule" has been part of De Beers's marketing for years now; De Beers is a diamond cartel. What else would they try to get people to think?    Believe me, if she's not happy with what you can afford, she's not ready to be a life partner for anyone.|`|3N3IXFfhaa	well they say your supposed to save 3x however much you get paid a month. so say you get paid 2k a month then your ring should cost around 6k. but this is up to you and you budget. aw your so sweet. i wish my man would propose.  good luck and congrats!|`|aAL7Y7zXaa	It all depends on you and your budget.  For example my now fiance and I went together to see which one i liked and we picked it out according to what he could afford monthly.  I have a 1.6k princess cut center diamond with 3 princess cut diamonds on each side and its about $17,000 or so.  Its very beautiful and pleeeeeeease always look at the quality.  don't ever buy a bad diamond and its always best to have it certified.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	My rings (engagement and wedding) cost around 10k. However, my husband is an attorney and I make pretty good money myself.    You should spend what you can afford.|`|nujen4dmaa	Spend what you can afford.    Good time to start learning about diamonds here at http://www.pricescope.com    Start visiting jewelery stores to get an idea of the shape, color and clarity you can live with in terms of your budget.    IdealD
yCkCqFmjaa	Well, stick with the people who you know you can trust... the people who don't talk about you, the people who are nice to you... and don't worry about it. Just relax and have fun playing tennis, don't worry about what the coach thinks of you... just do your best and enjoy being on the team. Relax and just be you... and smile at people, everyone likes a friendly person :)    God bless,  Secret Agent Bucktooth|`|16Ak0ARtaa	dont even do tennis there if people are gunna bring you down like that all the time  you need to feel good when you play sports so that it can bring up your spirit and help you play better  and dont go easy on people just cause they are your friends just play like you always do dont be afraid.
AA11312653	You can have a wonderful PARTY (a dance, a recpetion, a tea, a dinner, a pig roast) in a few years but a WEDDING only happens when there is a MARRIAGE taking place.|`|YgggHhwuaa	Have a big informal BBQ at the beach or something. Something fun with food, cake, and all the aspects of a wedding. It is just a fun way to celebrate low key.
psnaJcvpaa	You may of answered your own question LOL    How about buying him something to do with Metallica?  Look here for merchandise >>http://store.metallica.com/store/store_s... They have got Hoody's,Sweatshirts etc..and they have got the new 2009 calendar.    You can also maybe buy him a computer game of his choice..any books or games about Chemistry..and if he loves sweets..go here>>http://www.jellybelly.com/.. ..     He will love these lol    Once you have got all of these wrapped up in nice anniversary wrapping paper, you can then present them in a nice gift bag....    Hope he will go to the same trouble as you have lol    Happy Anniversary!|`|bIGFWlDHaa	a 3 foot dildo|`|a3Vm8Z2Zaa	Tell him that he is your sugar, and get him a giant golden C6H12O6 molecule (glucose)|`|Pq6FbSuEaa	buy him something he will like... or dont buy him anything at all. just spend the day together. its also me and my boyfriends 3rd yr anniversary (on friday) and all we are going to do is have a meal and spend all day together :D the best present i could ever want
Az8JInKdaa	Yes if you're married.|`|Co7BtKiPaa	you have to trust  you can never be sure =p|`|53QQ9KXEaa	No, I don't think it's ever a sure thing... All you can do is find someone that you enjoy being around, treats you right, and can't picture yourself without. By the last one, I mean because you want them around not need them.|`|10zaYXqGaa	You can't, cause there isn't just one person for you, there are more people, and perhaps better fitting people, but I'm a romantic, so go for it, believe she is the one and be happy, cause even if she isn't at least you tried and lived.    Carpe Diem|`|fQeS0qWWaa	u cant|`|19TSkwaKaa	You can't.  Not untill youve been through EVERYTHING and you still feel the same.|`|CA9OFT4Waa	if she was the one, you wouldn't have to think twice about it, you would just know.|`|zh9kfW5Eaa	I agree with Steph. When you find someone that will love you for you, and that you are truely happy with, then you two will be great together. If the feelings are mutual.
JlDcVTVsaa	I think you should try to talk to him and ask him why he is upset. and tell him that you wont judge or laugh at him.    Maybe he is in love with an emo girl?|`|16Ak0ARtaa	it must be that he wants to be emo  and that some of his friends are emo and he just wants to fit in  trust me it will blow over hes just 11 and hes try to be cool|`|qZcd1OjNaa	Jeez, you need to talk to your brother. He is immitating this from somewhere, he might want attention. What ever you do, don't let him turn emo! I've been called emo all the time, you get picked on, and beat up. Don't let him do this, unless he wants to go thru hell.|`|0gONjiSzaa	I think the best thing you can do for him is let him know that you're there for him and that he can confide in you. Make sure he knows you care about him and want to see him happy and healthy. If his depressed behavior continues, you might want to mention it to a parent or other relative or even a guidance counselor at school. Good luck!|`|HRQjffv8aa	He was probably asking you that to check if he himself was emo or something like that, he wanted to check if he was emo because of the way he's acting. How about try taking him to someplace fun or something? or ask his friends to help him get out of his room. My bro acted like this once, but not this extreme, i just took him to a fun place[park,amusement park anything] and gave him some ice cream and stuff, he cant keep frowning forever|`|9SWklMBBaa	He's too young to be emo. I personally am to far doown the emo transformation trail to come back (yeah, I cut myself a little, but nothing fatal. I need to rule the world someday, and I can't be dead for that), but he's still young. Just tell him not to be an idiot, and show him the good things in life. Play ball with him, take him out to eat, maybe see a movie. Make sure he's happy.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	well, its not like u could have told him theyre *happy go-lucky* ppl. either- he has a life and knows wats going on- mayb hes having some trouble at school, or is mad at some1, or hopefully in a phase  if hes not eating, i suggest  bribing him with a choco bar or something- like ask him if u can borrow his ______( something hell let u borrow, that he doesnt kno where it is, so u can randomly pretend ur looking in his drawer or something, and waste time) but bring some sweets in, and leave them in the room while ur searching  a couple of high calorie treats always make me feel my hunger  and for the depressed partr, mayb suprize him with a gift or something, or a new game|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Heyy!! I would try talking with your bother... get him to open up to you. Ask him how he feels and such... My friend was acting the same way when his parents went through a divorce... some people take it easy and calm other not. I would talk to him, give him postive hopes, and tell him to hang in there.... try feeding him his favorite candy ^_^  You could talk to him about something you both have in common also... like trying to get his mind off the family problem...  i wish and hope the best for you and your family =D    As with the emoness things, you didn't really give him the wrong info. but i would just choose carefully as to what you say so you don't give him the ideas that he's becoming emo and such...    Again best wishes =D  e-mail me if you need any more help ^_^    byess!! you have a great day too!!
niQrowgKaa	its not typical for hickies to hurt, but it might a lil bit after the first day. then it will just darken and go away in a couple of days|`|pqholNyqaa	it depends on whether or not they bit you hard.|`|YY5kGrwCaa	no they don't hurt|`|731a2812389b0bee32cddb4ad5329e29aa	idk|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	Sometimes.  It all depends on how sensitive you are.  I am really sensitive so they tend to hurt.|`|TM09z7teaa	Its not suppose to  hurt. Maybe he was just really rough.  And thats the reason it hurt. :]  Dont worry.|`|nAH87QqVaa	sometimes they hurt its just bruising is all|`|huJP0fcIaa	it may be a bruise.|`|15VxE4vdaa	only if administered by a vacuum|`|zzPy8s9baa	yeah, some of them can hurt. I had one that not only hurted by started to itch. After that one, I didnt allow my g/f to do it again.|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	NO but they Are embarrassing    especially when your grandparents come over the next morning =D|`|r5oL56xCaa	honestly...i wouldn't know|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	God, I hate when guys do that.  It's like they're branding you.  So immature.  Yes, it will often hurt a bit the next day if you touch it, it is similar to a bruise.|`|16Ak0ARtaa	yeahh i used to get them alot and my neck would hurt alott  just be careful   ohh and hickeys can give you blood clotts|`|ALvp7YRuaa	no not really unless you want it to hurt.|`|tpvcJwfvaa	Normally they don't hurt, and why are you letting someone give you a hickey anyway... Those are so gross, and nasty.  You|`|HH90Eghaaa	Its a bruise, so yeah they can hurt!|`|LQqAzHbVaa	yah I would say it could be sore  u know...kinda like a bruise?|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Ho (Fo' Sho) /\|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yeah, but it is all worth it. some just turn red/purple but for the most part they hurt|`|CPxyW6Afaa	it might hurt if you have sensitive skin   other wise it shouldn't|`|5bknapOQaa	It shouldn't. I had one for a week before. There was never a time I felt pain.|`|0oiz1hySaa	sometyms it will if he/she did it hard enough but he i had a hickie &&it was sore for a while.....|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Well a hickey is a bruise and bruises hurt, so yeah. Not that I would know because I've never had one in my life. Tackiest thing ever, (no offense).    But I had a friend who had a crazy night with a friend and came home with hickeys so dark they lasted for 3 weeks! She couldn't even turn her neck without hurting because they were everywhere and they hurt her a lot.|`|PxhEDoCWaa	it shouldn't hurt to bad, but it might hurt a little. A hickey is when you suck on skin and it sucks blood to the surface. A bruise is about the same thing... So it might hurt a bit. Don't worry. Why are you letting people suck on you anyways though :-P|`|wGLviOMPaa	The area can be sore the next day, but depends on the force applied by the suction of your partner, and your own tenderness.     You are essentially pulling parts of your body toward the surface, and stretching them, so they may be tender the next day.     If you put a strong vaccuum cleaner on your neck, would it hurt the next day?|`|lA3FqLUfaa	no it doesn't hurt|`|7h0qfos1aa	Yeah because it's a bruise...   just don't ever get one on your nipple! THAT hurts.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	well it shouldn't hurt really|`|CA9OFT4Waa	no thats not normal, are you sure he didn't bite it a little? because that might cause slight bruising and then it would hurt a little|`|aoyVeq16aa	not at all.  it usually won't hurt.       maybe he was a little too rough.
D2bx76kJaa	You didn't give a real reason on why they removed your kids from you. Was it drugs abuse or what? If I were you I would get a lawyer to help out  with this. Don't waste time as time has no mercy and children grow up very quickly.|`|4DEVVRlIaa	Get a lawyer. Tell them your mother-in-law is comitting what is called extortion. That is a major crime. I know you haven't told the reason why your kids were taken away. But if you love them with all your heart, you need to do right by them. Take parenting classes. I took one back in the day, they do help greatly. Straighten out your life. No drugs or alcohol. Find activities you can do that are more beneficial. You have to show the judge that you are a good person and that you have taken steps to change your life for the better.    And most importantly. I can't stress this enough. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS!! Write down day, time, what happened, who was involved, etc. Then you can give that to judge. Don't let your mother-in-law pull this stuff. If I could say something to her it would be "Where do you get off?" Its people like that who really make me mad. Its obvious this woman isn't really thinking of the best interest of those kids. She is more into getting revenge. Its sad. But please, start documenting everything. That will be your proof that she is doing harm to your kids.|`|HBM1qu0Saa	You haven't said enough, for instance,  Why is your mother in law angry at you?    What was the reason given that the children were removed?|`|rw9VL1Ymaa	CPS does not remove children without evidence of maltreatment or abuse. Children have to be in danger in order to be removed from the parents. The sooner you take responsibility in the situation and complete the case plan offered by CPS the higher the chance you have of getting your children back. Keep in mind though that if they are under the age of 8 you have 6 months to get it together or you will lose them permanently.     If you continue in denial, do not work the case plan it is highly likely you will lose your kids permanently. If CPS has taken the kids you will see a judge and be appointed an atty but you need to remember that it is smarter to do what is asked than be stubborn about it.|`|AA10620879	You do not say what state you are in? If you have contacted your CPS case worker be sure to give a specific time frame that you want a response, say 48 hrs  and if nothing than call back and ask for Supervisor giving again specific time frame. After that Check with Administration of CPS in your state they should have an Ombudsmen or a liaison that you can call an complain that your case is not being handled properly. The children should also be appointed a GUARDIAN AD LITEM (attorney) and a CASA worker that will represent the kids welfare. I have included some websites that hopefully can point you in the right direction in your area. Good Luck

I sincerely hope you don't turn into a psycho or a 'dumb sports player'      All the best for your hellish or beautiful Teen years! It depends on your decisions so play your cards right. You have your whole life in front of you! wow, that makes me sound so old!|`|lYr1zmQeaa	yeah, you sound really sweet and caring but if you want people to notice you you have to have the confidence to go out there and notice them, and play down all those academic things and just hint at them, its really cool when a guy turns out to be super smart but doesnt seem cocky about his achievements. and i totally agree with the whole love doesnt exist while you're young thing.|`|uUyValuYaa	I think that you are like the perfect guy! I agree with mostly everything you said in your statement about how us girls always go out with dumb guys. Which I never do! I think you would make an awsome friend! Seeing how you seem so caring and kind toward girls.|`|5n5QNsIraa	dear ryan,   i found u alittle bit like myself when i was a 13 years old boy or alittle more. in that age i didnt care about sexual matters or even to girls. i would like todo something greater. but now at 22 i am very into girls and try to have more and more relationship with them. thats the life. we cant behave like gays.thats the real life.  and the path of finding friends is not like this. chatting or sending a request on yahoo or any other site.u should go and talk and contact and make friends. the process is more exciting than what u think.  so try and i hope u be successful. and do it soon cause i think after 20 its alittle late to start
tOdjjeAmaa	Hope I get this right. He will have to update his "DEERS" info, which lists his dependents. They have an office for that, and you can get your military ID when you do that. As for SS and DMV stuff, just go to your county offices and bring your original cards and your marriage license and they are pretty smooth about taking care of that stuff quickly. You'll get your new license with your new name the same day, and your Social Security card will be mailed to you within 2 weeks. I think you should wait until your name is changed on those things before you go get your military ID. It's really not too difficult to get it all changed though.     Oh! and to get on Tricare, we went to the hospital on base to get me registered and it was super easy, with no appointment required. Memorize his SSN really quick because they go by his, not yours, a lot as far as Army is concerned in order to identify you for everything.    Good luck and congrats :)|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	You'll need a copy of your marrige licence to give the Army so you can either apply for base housing or begin collecting your housing allowance. You will need to go to the base admin office and get your dependant ID card so you can get on base and that will enroll you into Deers for our health insurance. SS and DMV is just putting in for a name change.
vztEwvT8aa	I imagine it's different for everyone. I went on a mad bender, I thought waking up in strange places with even stranger women would take my mind of it....mate it never.    You just wake up one day and think f*ck this and try and re-build your life. From my experience it seemed no-one had ever been more hurt than yourself, but that's not the case. I thought one day, you either continue to "self' destruct" or you get a grip...I have kids with my ex so used that responsibility to sort my life out.    edit: Btw any bloke that does the old "male-pride" thing is an idiot who has obviously never been there.|`|4POGapREaa	I think the more I talked to friends, went out, and socialized, the more I realized my relationship wasn't okay or good in any way.  There wasn't a moment that I had an epiphany or anything.  It just slowly made sense & took care of itself.  Lots of heartbreak, lots of time lost, lots of self discovery but all in all totally worth what I learned, how much I grew, what I expected from people, and how I wanted to change for myself.  It just naturally progressed into what I wanted to become & I stopped focusing on the past at some point.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	At first, I just thought about him less and less.  When that happened, I did stop feeling miserable.  It takes a while, don't expect miracles. It took me almost 2 years.  But then I was married for 27 years.  It's been 9 years now and now I can look back and enjoy the memories and forget the rest.  I have moved on and have a very fulfilling new life.   Red|`|FBhjhjR0aa	My ex-husband hurt me all the time, cheating on me, giving me an STD frm cheating on me, losing his wedding ring because he was cheating on me, beating me up, and just lying non-stop. I took enough of it, heard enough of his crying after he got caught and decided i was done.    He got drunk again like always, hit me , yelled at me. So I played it real cool, he started to cry and tell me how sorry he was, like he always did. So I acted like I was ok with his 'apology' and told him that he just needs some time with his buddies. So I drove him over to his buddies house, and NEVER WENT BACK!      I waited til a week later, when I knew he would be at work, and I went in to our apartment, took my things and NEVER LOOKED BACK!  and to this day, i'm glad that i left, I wish i would have just left alot sooner. I'am now re-married to my best friend, the man of my dreams!  10 years and still going strong!|`|iM2BaJbeaa	Eventually if will fade away and then one day you will be like wow, haven't thought about that person in a long time. I think it comes with the faster you pick of the pieces of you and start figuring out who you are again the easier it will be.|`|L8kSyfThaa	When I dipped my toes into the lake and started to drowned,He grabbed me from behind ..... The trees had eyes and ears . The wind breezed by as   we ran for our lives to the sweet grasslands by the lakes shore .....and that was ALL she wrote!       he he ... Now there is this smell of magnolias in the air ...Do you DARE?|`|encb0jc2aa	it takes time, although you may never fully be cured.  People we love so unconditionally, tend to linger in our souls, the part of us that not longer feels whole.    Breathe my friend, it does become easier, and the tears stop too.  there will come a time when your breath will not burn, and your tears will spill at the slightest whisper in your ear.    Good luck friend, its been 8 years, and i still think of her.....but you can love  anew|`|kpH717h2aa	I stopped thinking about him every single day like i used to, then i gradually started to forget what it was like to be with him - what we did together, how i felt for him. I just feel nothing now.|`|eqLFfXfyaa	I basically dwelled on all of his bad habits and wondered how he didn't drive me away sooner. I thought of the benefits of being without him. It kind of happened when I went to the grocery store. There, I realized I could pick out whatever I wanted and I didn't have to think about whether he would like what I was buying or not. I know that's a small thing, but it really displayed to me how free I would be. Yes I missed him a lot, but I knew life had to go on and that there was a perfectly good reason that we could not be together anymore.|`|5VdB8njTaa	In total it took around 18 months to get over a 6 year relationship. I concentrated on making myself into quite a desirable person and that helped a lot. Distractions help too.|`|AA11496842	Who wants to remember an ex??? Hell not me!!|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	first one was a breeze, I detoxed from alcohol abuse and went to disneyworld in fla.. threw a bar b que and invited everyone,,, second one was tragic, cancer eat her alive. she recovered but wanted out,, therewasn'tt any money left for her chemo treatments and the statewouldn'tt pay if she was married,, third happened when I was in the hospital, she took everything I owned and left... I was diagnosed a bi polar and shedidn'tt want to be married to a bi polar,,, never hit her or cheated on her,, she just wanted to go...she was crazy anyway so it took me a few weeks to get over her... I miss her kids though,,, she was a thorn in my side but the kids were great.it all depends on the situation at the time of the breakup.. some will have it harder than others,some will not have a problem, depends on all the circumstances that caused it to happen
K8OjmMUAaa	It sounds like your Mom is the one with the problem. She sounds like a control freak and a perfectionist. I grew up with one so I know exactly how you feel.     There is nothing wrong with you! You just have a different way of doing things than your Mom, and she can't stand it. For instance, my Mom never forgets anything, everything is always in its place, she doesn't lose things, ect and I am completely scatterbrained. I forget EVERYTHING. I lose EVERYTHING. She yelled at me constantly about that until I was in my 20's and finally told her to lay off me, that I'm not her and frankly never will be!     Also, is your Mom old enough to be in menopause? My Mom was in menopause when I was a teen, and it made her unbelievably cranky. Some days, I couldn't even walk right according to her!     Maybe another relative, perhaps an aunt or an older cousin, could talk to her? She may need to hear from someone else that she's being too hard on you. Lots of parents don't take their kids' word for it that they're hurting their feelings unneccesarily. If it gets too bad you could even see if your school counselor will talk to you about it and perhaps even arrange a conference so the two of you can talk. Mom will be less likely to be unreasonable when another adult is present.     Otherwise, you just have to put up with it until you move out and get your own place, then you can seriously do whatever you want and won't have to deal with her anymore.|`|qZcd1OjNaa	My parents are the same, there is nothing wrong with you!!! Your other friends parents don't pay attention to their kids. you will thank your parents later, they just don't want you to end up a lazy *** person when your older.|`|HBM1qu0Saa	Your mother sounds stressed.   She probably doesn't realize she is yelling, Tell her, and tell her it is frightening you. Ask her if there is something you can help her with.       Or, take a look around the house and find somthing nice to do for her.   Pick a flower and give it to her with a hug    Do this everytime she yells.    She will melt, I know, I'm a mom too.|`|9899849514fec79e34dc8ab3978c09cbaa	I can't believe all you kids on here that get upset with your mothers- Grow - up , thats a part of life-
71VRvldJaa	Yes it's very possible!  There's a thin line between love and hate but the bottom line is that it takes emotional involvement in the person to feel both of those things because they are both emotions!  It's when you become indifferent and don't feel anything  or care about anything they say or do that you know you've emotionally detached from the person|`|zprAkP3eaa	I love my b/f but when he makes me really mad i hate him.|`|byWl2fw0aa	Oh, it's not subliminal...  You hate things about him...and it's piling up. Once those things get piled up to a big enough pile, you're going to go off on him one way or another.     How did he screw you over on Saturday? Stand you up for a date? Have sex with another woman?     Have you talked to him and told him your feelings on the things that he does? Perhaps he is ignorant to what he's doing. Granted, if he's cheating on you...then he knows what he was doing and you need to dump him right away. No reason to stick in a relationship where you can't trust them.    But if what you're hating about what he did on Saturday isn't that serious...you seriously need to tell him in plain language about how he's screwing you over.|`|5vO61nuvaa	Maybe you hate yourself for loving him so much that you put up with things time and time again.
bfhsP4GFaa	It's a good thing that you can see what you're doing, but now it's time to take the big step. You need to change. If your friends are there for you, they deserve you to be there for them. Being grumpy/disrespectful could just be your mood, and not your personality. Have you tried getting more hours of sleep a night? Even if you go to bed a half an hour earlier every night, it alters your mood. Evening primrose oil is a natural substance that can be bought for cheap in pills - It helps to improve your mood as well. I took it for a long time when I was younger. Next time you're in a really good mood, maybe mass email your close friends and apologize for not being a good friend, and let them know that you've realized you need to become a better person. It's probably better if you email them individually though, and possibly get personal and apologize for something you have done to each one specifically. The more specific the apology, the better the chance they accept it. If you feel brave enough, apologizing on the phone or in person means a lot more, but if you don't think you can, an apology is still an apology.    Learn respect now, or you'll have none when you're older. When you're nicer to people, you feel like a better person. You feel as though you've worked just as hard as the other person, and you don't have to worry that you're not "putting in your share". It's also true that if you're a bi*ch to them and they're still there for you, they are true friends. You'll feel awfully lonely without them. And having a good relationship with friends holds the rest of your life together - they can motivate you to move towards your goals, hold your hand before you make the hardest decision of your life, give you somewhere to stay if you have no place to go, stick up for you when others are putting you down.. Friends are a huge part of emotional stability.  There's always the possibility that they aren't the right group of friends for you.. Do you have similar interests? Think about it. Maybe you'd be kinder to friends who were more like you.  If you want someone to talk to, my email is open.|`|6HhO1Evfaa	I'm in the same situation both ways. Invite them over while you are looking directly at them.  If they say no and say they are doing something with that sweaty, eyes lying look, then don't hang around them so much.  If they say yes with a smile, then they are your friends.  If their eyes make contact with yours and they don't look to the side, they are being honest and you might not bother them.  Trust me, I am the best friend to someone I loathe, so if you can, you might stop hanging out with them, or hang out with them less.  If they seem to like you even though you claim they would be better off without you, then be their friend.|`|igE5LWoAaa	Maybe they like the abuse. Or they're scared of what you'll do to them if they spoke up. It seems like you like your friends, but maybe can't control your "bad" behavior? Talk to them, treat them differently and see how they react, or if there isn't really anything you think you are capable of changing (if anything) then maybe you should find another group of friends, but I wouldn't recommend that last one unless you're absolutely desperate.|`|bObtJCAVaa	Stop being an *** to them and maybe they will accept you.|`|ldQStJNRaa	If they're your true friends, then they are certainly not better off without you! Don't worry, you might just be going through a rough patch; start being nicer, if that's the problem! Show them what a great friend you truly are!  Hope I helped.  -Amy|`|wtIWal7Waa	maybe you should stop being a b*tch and leave them alone.|`|ssT6J7ifaa	you should stop being a ****** to them. cause your not a good freind if you acted like that|`|BecQJR54aa	first you should say your sorry to them and ask if you have really hurt them in any way. if so say your sorry. and from now on you should just be yourself, just nicer and not a b****. (: hope i helped|`|UgVuQJriaa	I think that if they are still there for you but they still think your a ***** then I don't think that they care if you are or not because they still got your back. If that doesn't help then I think that you should tell them how you feel and if their your real friends then they will understand. I hope i helped:).|`|KbuOMIPxaa	well lol u gotta stop being a ***** I'm sure your not as bad as u think but try and be nice, think before you talk, listen to them. I think you should confront them about this or just be nice for a couple of weeks and see if your still in the same situation. trust me you would know if they definatly didnt wnt you around but they sound like they care so i dunno why ur worrying enjoy your time with them|`|vGCetYmAaa	LET THEM DECIDE, SEE IF THEY ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH.'  IF THEY ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO YOU WANT TO BE WITH THEY WOULD DECID TO STILL BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.|`|hG8uzuMGaa	you should stop being a ***** to them|`|etb6a7F0aa	i think you should be nice to your friends so that they will be nice to you.  if you fight with them and don't talk to them anymore, you won't have any friends at all.|`|At5AV1YUaa	If you were really so bad they wouldn't stick around,    maybe try to be nicer seen as they are so nice to you.|`|PxhEDoCWaa	Start treating them better! DUH!!!! It's not that hard.|`|HxbLwCEKaa	Here are your choices:    1. Stop being a ***** and apologise  2. Keep being a ***** and waiting until they tell you to sod off  3. Keep being a ***** but ditch them and be miserable|`|6uJWQI03aa	uhh.. if you're a ***** to them, and they're still there for you, then they're you're true friends. keep befriending them, and tell them how you feel.|`|a3Vm8Z2Zaa	You should make a legitimate effort to be nicer to them. Take an interest in what they are doing. Don't be a ***** basically.|`|uCF9YYYCaa	be there friend because if they were annoyed by you being a ***** they would of walked out on you a long time ago.|`|a6QK1oQFaa	just let it be, they talk to u...talk with them ( nicely)..  they dont talk to ..dont talk to them..  let them decide :)|`|uGIIR9Beaa	Apologize if you feel you've been rude or unfriendly. They surely will talk about it then or tell you it's okay.
Fsq9qvkqaa	Oh boy, I've had experience with this. Too much, actually.  But he/she will start ignoring you, making excuses to call off hanging out, just plain making excuses, avoiding you at school/work/wherever, not answering your calls (especially a sign if you used to call each other a lot), being very vague and closed off with you (giving one word answers, not really engaging in conversation).   You should just confront your friend and ask them what is going on, otherwise you will keep on wondering and guessing and assuming.|`|0jDuZRGfaa	Usually he/she say things to try to get through your conversation with them as soon as possible.They may also not speak with you that often.Another sign is if they hang out with alot of other people, and say they don't " have time" for you. If that is happening with you, i am truly sorry =( it is never fun when a friend doesn't want you around them anymore =(|`|nHhQ952Kaa	usually it's just avoiding you, and it freaking sucks.|`|qTLVVKe9aa	at first what did she/he say?  if they hadent talked to you maybe the got in a fight
5E4t2xqNaa	Look through the trash when she walks away.  Otherwise, unless she tells you, you'll never know. She could be writing anything... maybe something about a boy she likes and doesn't want you to know.|`|X061o2Lzaa	This is your sister's personal Business. I don't recommend poking and prying, because then your sister will get mad. Your sister will tell you when she is ready.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	do the same, and when she cracks in asking u wat it is, ask her 4 a trade|`|rlGLXwfmaa	was she writing a list for ur late surprise birthday party
zaSyEcnqaa	You sound mature and like you have your life together. You are supporting yourself and make your own decisions.  You need to just tell her. Hopefully she will support your choices. Leave that up to her and don't dwell on it.   That is all you can do.       You have the support of his family and should go about your planning and enjoy this time in your life.     Don't revert to being a "little girl" around your mom just because she does not like your fiance.  This is your life.|`|0qm2raXBaa	I know it is hard when you don't have your parent(s)' approval for your the man that you love but it is also out of respect that you must show them and tell them that you are getting married.  Whether or not they like it, it is going to happen.  The best thing I can say is be ready for whatever happens.  This may end up not in your favor even though you did your part and told them out of respect, but at least you've done your part.  I believe that it may be hard at first but once they see that you two are serious about this, they may change their mind. Good luck and congratulation!|`|QGQ54LDxaa	Throw the biggest surprise engagement party ever. Be sure that his family and friends are there to show your parents they support both of you. There is no way your mother could ever lecture you out of getting married after you've announced it to everyone. If she tries then introduce her to a family counselor that you brought to the engagement party (and spoke with about your mother previously), as back up.|`|y2kwqebraa	You're in a tough position.  I have personally been there.  I've been married now for going on almost 3 years (it will be on the 19th of Feb).  Anyway, my parents did not dislike my then fiance (now husband), but they were worried because he was from a different country and they were concerned that if things didn't work out with his "paperwork" that I may have to go back with him, being that I would be his wife.  As it turned out, I put my foot down.  One evening, I called him over to the house.  Soon as he walked in, I sat both of my parents down in the family room, with my fiance sitting next to me.  I then mentioned to them how a friend of mine was having a hard time with her parents, and how they may not attend her wedding.  So then I went on to explain that as my parents, I love them dearly, and that I want their blessing and for them to be part of this wonderful time in my life.  However, I told them too if they were not to give us their blessing, we would still get married because we love each other very much.  What was their responses?  Well, my dad just said, "Well, okay."  Then he asked my mom how she felt, and my mom just said, "Well, they know how we feel.  It's up to them."  So then my dad said, "Alright, we better go ahead and start planning this wedding."  I was so happy that I had stood my ground and showed how serious I was about my decision.  Sometimes parents just want to be assured that what you're doing is really what YOU want.  Most times, if they see that you are truly happy and 100% sure, they will back off and support you where need be.  Just make sure to remain respectful, but firm when talking to them.  I truly hope this helps you ;)....Just be STRONG.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	You sound responsible and mature, so I'm going to assume that your mother hates your fiance for no logical reason.  Odds are, you are not going to have your mom's support nor your dad's blessing, so you need to stop being so attached to trying to get it.  I would not suggest your fiance ask for your dad's blessing, b/c a. that might put your dad on the spot, and b. you're getting married blessing or not.    As for telling your mom:  If you can take her out to dinner within the next week or so, great.  But if she lives far away, you're going to have the burden of keeping your engagement secret from your mom until you get a chance to see her.  So if you can't tell her soon, I think you should tell her over the phone.  And if she throws a fit, don't get upset or let her drag you down.  Just calmly say, "I'm sorry you're not happy about this."  |`|nqINitkmaa	I think taking them out to dinner is a good idea. Tell them together. Your parents will be happy for you because you are so happy.     I told my parents by calling them and screaming "he proposed he proposed!!" right after he did it,but everyone is different|`|0AShsMsoaa	HE calls your dad and then he takes your dad out to dinner, man to man,  he speaks clearly and firmly and looks your dad in the eye and says he will take care of you and be loyal to you always, and, that he respects your dad and would sincerely like his blessing on your marriage.  he pays for dinner and leaves a 23% tip.      on the same day that he takes your dad out to dinner the doorbell rings and a dozen roses come for your mom and the note says, " thank you for being such a great mom to ____"  and it is signed " Yours, --------"      that lays the ground work with both parents of your adulthood and good intentions.  you could both meet with them and enthusisastically tell them your plans, and clearly tell your mom then how much you need her happiness for you and her support.  tell her. tell her.|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	I'd say that you both should do dinner with them together. But whatever choice you make, understand that all a mother really wants is her daughter to take a different path than what she did. Maybe she feels like you are going down the same path that she did, whatever it may be. Maybe marrying to early or marrying the wrong guy. My mother felt like this. She and my dad seem very very happy, yet when i sat her down and poured my heart out, she did the same and told me she thought i was making a mistake and doing the same mistakes she made. After i told her how much my fiance meant to me and asked her to give him a real chance, she backed off and now she even likes him. Alot actually. Maybe you should try it with her. She probably just doesn't understand. If I wrong. Then do whatever your heart tells you, because as long as your happy, thats all that matters in the long run. It's your life, live it.|`|AA10975867	If you do this in any other manner than TOGETHER and VERY HAPPY (not apprehensive in the least bit) then they will use that as a tool to say you are unsure. The two of you need to go to the house together, all smiles and positive, shove your ring into the air and announce that you're getting married. Period. Tell them you've come to visit so they could help you pick a good date. Give them every impression that the deal is done and that you actually expect them to be happy and supportive. If they give you a negative reception, act totally surprised, give them three possible dates and then split that pop-stand! Best way to get your mother on board is to have HIS mother all excited and phoning her, offering to help. I haven't seen a mom yet who didn't want to "out-do" the groom's mother in contributing! LOL!!
700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	no actually its not.    i have the same issue with one of my closest friends & i know it sucks. all they want to think about is their own problems that they're probably blowing out of proportion anyway.    its perfectly normal to want your friend to listen to YOU when you need to vent and not use it as an opportunity to go on about her own life.  what you need to to is sit down & just talk to her. at first, she won't accept it and will probably just think you're bsing, but after a while it'll filter through. you need to work out these issues now before things get worse & you lose the friendship.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	No, because if this girl is your true friend, she should listen to your concerns and worries and be there for you. She shouldn't be comparing your problems to hers and devaluing and belittling how you feel.  Next time this happens, when she starts to compare and talk about her problems, just say "I really need to vent this out" or something along the lines of that. If she doesn't listen to you, you should find someone else to talk to. Good luck :]
gmjGQua4aa	aw wow :[.  i would go with the first answer, charge them-but people are retarded these days and they will probably ask why your charging them and blah blah blah.  Just tell them "read the instructions" or "get your dad or mom to do it"  or "im really busy right now"  or just go to their house and pretend you don't know how to fix it.  then they would probably stop asking you.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	i agree with the answer above me|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Perfect time to make some money.. Start charging them to do It. If they want to use you then they should pay for it|`|uCF9YYYCaa	you can either  1. speak up and say its bothering you  2. tell them to learn themselves and if you want you can teach them  3. make up excuses not to do them    i would go with  1 but once again im different. take time for consideration|`|n30quwi3aa	if its only 10 percent 0f the time then i would not worry about it. be friends abd call it a day|`|TycCeqtaaa	i dont get what you said about them not using you 90% of the time but okay. when they call just say that your busy and that the easiest way to set up their things is to read the manual and if they say well i'll just wait till your done then just be like dude chill just look at the manual cuz im not fixing to do this over and over okay? so if they be like what crawled up your @$$? then you be like look dude im sorry but just do it yourself. and thats it. you aint gotta give them excuses.|`|poC9j0Diaa	You could tell them that you are busy the next time that you don't want to do anything or you could simply just tell them no. and yes they aren't using you 90 percent of the time but they are still useing you!!!

180rE9rGaa	honestly, you don't need to give guys anything "creative". no, we don't like your poetry or whatever. just give him a bl0wjob. easy as 123.|`|xbMLtXOuaa	bake a cake! write something nice with icing, "" |`|SEfBwYiOaa	have a pictuce of the pair of you taken after a great day together even if its in a photo booth thing just do it let him forget about it and then surprise him with it..... good luck|`|dRpiIZ2Faa	yourself|`|CA9OFT4Waa	get him a card, something sweet (a cake,cookies,cupcakes) and a teddy bear, trust me, they don't really care, they're boys. they are not like us!
GzYtIbizaa	Call him! you will never know unless you try.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Maybe his wife found his cell phone? Who knows. He may have just decided that he didn't really like you that much. Just forget it. He obviously wasn't worth your trouble.|`|PIxJ1Ljgaa	He's doing it so he doesn't look like he's desperate. I've done this trick many times and as you can see, it obviously worked on you. Now you're hanging by your phone waiting for a response and when he finally replies you don't care what he says.    Either that, or he's not interested. But that's unlikely.|`|hXFndli2aa	Just maybe his cellphone got disconnected so he ain't getting your txt messages and was unable to let you know that his phone got disconnected. or he decided that he was no longer interested and is coward because he won't tell you that he is no longer interested. Don't waste your time waiting for him to reply if he didn't reply the 1st time he is not worth your time.|`|rbzoNe12aa	I must admit that I have done similar things in the past. Usually something else just came up. Maybe I had just broken up with a girl and we got back together or I was seeing someone else too and it just got more serious. You should just let this one go. If he really did like you, it sounds like he did, and there is no extenuating circumstance, he will call you.|`|e6d4e32d1f84dc3fa8623164005afb1faa	What's the best way to just let it go?   Watch the new movie coming out this Friday called, "He's just not that into you".
D2bx76kJaa	You knew better drunk or not you are not a true friend.Since you knew it would matter to her and did it anyway you get what you deserve.With friends like you who needs enemies? No help here and no pitty. Just a shame on you!|`|ee97f3c7ffcf7d47dc6882e63330d45aaa	depends on how much you value your friendship, total honesty is not always needed, let her find out on her own, if ever..if you want to remain friends for a long time total silence would be a good suggestion. its your sex life, no real need to broadcast it to the world, unless you acquired an std that she could have prevented from that encounter|`|PQjPq6Ddaa	Just like you just told us... bring it up by just telling her that you have to get something off your chest, even though you are afraid that getting it off your chest may hurt her.  Tell her that you realize that he isnt worth your friendship, but there was an attraction between you to and when you were drinking you loosened up, and something happened, tell her that you love her, and do not want to lose her... Just explain it, if she is a TRUE friend she will understand...|`|G6agrhryaa	If you value the relationship just stay away from him and don't mention it to anyone.  If he brings it up you can always say you were too drunk to remember and leave it at that. This will only work if you show no interest in him whatsoever. If you honestly have a thing for him, get ready for some drama unless your friend is really REALLY understanding.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	"hey friend, i had a one night stand with your ex"|`|nYjZqpYGaa	sit her down an tell her how much she means to you and that u made a terrible mistake and when she starts to get freaked out then tell her|`|56BbQHXEaa	why do u hav to tell her?|`|KxPgH6jcaa	The best way to do this is to tell her, honest is the best policy, and yea she will be mad but she get over it and realize ur friendship is not worth fighting. It not like they were dating so expect anger but get it out the way.|`|08y217Rdaa	He's her "ex", right? So why in the name of pumpkin should she care?  One good reason? Women are crazy.|`|2uPEty21aa	It's your guilt trip, don't try passing it on.  You won't feel any better and quite frankly it's nobodies business but yours anyway.|`|jZGdb1bqaa	Well he's an ex for a reason. Yeah it might be kind of awkward to tell her. But to be honest if she gets mad about it it's because she still has feelings for her ex. If she really cares about you, then she will be happy so long as your happy. If that means you being together with him then so be it. But if it was a one time thing only and you don't want anything more with him then just tell her and then you can move on. If she takes it bad, she will get over it.|`|b6g2C42caa	you don't|`|EdidZdtlaa	i would just tell her and see how she acts. if shes a good friend she'll come around if she get mad about it.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Just say to your friend..  You remember (when ever it happened) well me and (the persons name) kinda got a bit close..and one thing lead to another. I am so sorry! I cant believe ive jepardised our relationship for a boy! Can you forgive me!?|`|AA12035186	Like my friend told me:  ___________ (insert name of person you are talking to), I did your ex.  We compared notes. LOL|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	sit her down and be like   look i did something and its driving my crazy. I want you to know because you are my friend and i don't want to keep things between us and i also want to be honest with you. Please hear me out and respect me for telling you. But yadda yadda etc..|`|YY5kGrwCaa	just explain to her what happened and tell her how bad you feel.i think she will understand.|`|AA10313295	If  you want to keep that friend...you will never tell her.  You will not be able to maintain the friendship.   If you tell her it will only be because you feel guilty and you feel the need to "purge" the information.  Don't be selfish.  Sometimes honesty is not the best policy.|`|TM09z7teaa	You should sit her down or when you stay the night or spend time with her just tell her. And tell her that it wasnt worth it didnt mean it at all.  Explain everything to her and talk from your heart.  Maybe even start the water works.    Good luck.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	just tell her you need to talk to her  and that you want to be honest with her  and that you dont want her to judge you  but you understand if she gets upset  and then just tell her  and reassure her that she means more to you then that did  and that alcohol did help, and that your really sorry  she could take it good, bad, or horrible  but lets just hope for the best    good luck! :D
CA9OFT4Waa	she has a crush on you, theres no doubt, but she is comfortably with what she has at home because she is use to it, new boys in college are always the hardest thing to get. because half the guys are just looking for a one night stand, so must girls don't risk something they know is true for something that wont work out, i would suggest that you just talk to her and become a friend, and im sure eventually she will come around.|`|W4qKyansaa	maybe she had a crush or thoughts about being with you, or maybe she just wondered if she could and now she knows she is embarassed or trying not to cheat. with girls you never know|`|Gp160xHOaa	Shes probably avoiding you because she is probably afraid that you are ganna keep talking to her about a possibility of you two.You should text her and let her know that you guys are just friends and that you respect the fact she gots a boyfriend.Let her know that your still there to be her friend.|`|SEfBwYiOaa	perhaps the reason the things you saw her doing only seemed she was hitting on you because you so wanted her to be.|`|AA12008085	i'm not 100% sure, but i think she might have played u. she may look like someone who doesn't have a boyfriend and wants one, but then when u start talking to her, then she tells u that she has a boyfriend. i would just move on. believe me, that happened to me before.|`|ZTszDMbvaa	If she is, as you say, shy, she probably hasn't had experience on how to handle a situation like this. Things between you probably feel awkward because she doesn't know how to act around a guy friend who supposedly likes her. You could try being very casual and just acting as if it never happened - it may not be as healthy or 'mature' than sitting down and talking things over, but it's a heck of a lot more effective in overcoming awkwardness.
BA3y6MBlaa	Yes, I believe the stories  Have I ever seen it or felt it, no  It's been my experience that there are many people that you connect with that feel "comfortable", not just one.  Like that old saying "you can fall in love with a rich man as easily as a poor man".  It's true!  We're all just people wanting to connect, be made to feel special, cause hey (pretend I'm doing that snap Z thing) we are!  I've had that feeling of connection/soulmate thing more with girlfriends.  After the honeymoon is over, you're not as funny or clever any more.  It works both ways!  I'm just being silly.  I hope you get what you are looking for.|`|AA12201622	yes I do, but some people never meet their soul mate|`|YbDf0uDHaa	Of course. My boyfriend is always calling me the one and his soulmate. Were like two peas in a pod.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	NO|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	I met mine, but I wasn't hers.    Yes, I do believe in them. We don't all get to do something with them though.|`|AA12035186	I used to believe there was a 'soul mate' for everyone.  Then I guess I just started thinking life is chance.  If you meet the perfect person - you are just lucky.  Good luck to you.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	Not especially.    I've been married for almost 21 years and I can safely say that my hubby is not my soul mate.    He is my best friend, confidant, crutch and drinking buddy, but not a soul mate.  Not even sure I'd know a soul mate if I fell over one.|`|YY5kGrwCaa	im married and im 24 i guess pretty young to be married but i do believe in soulmates if yuo ever doubt it i dont think it's really love.|`|sOvq1MTXaa	yes i do, oh god i really really believe in soul mate.|`|lxhImymTaa	yes i do . some people are very lucky to find theres|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	i have to believe in them :) ? sucks that not everyone ends up with theirs|`|apLEYPzVaa	No|`|UYDfatjyaa	i absolutely believe in soul mates.  i have met mine and i know that i want to spend the rest of my life with him.  no matter how much i say that he bothers me and how annoying he can get, i will love him no matter what he does and i look at people sometimes and i think they're cute but i would never give up erik for them, i just love him way too much.  erik is absolutely my soul mate and i believe in them so much, i really wish everyone found someone the way that i have found mine.
UCeXWLrQaa	I would like a guy that treats me as if I was the only girl around.  Compliments and maybe asking her questions about the class (even though you understand it)|`|dDDAbqqhaa	You have to remember what one girl  might like..another may find completely weird|`|XPrsJBnvaa	Lots of eye contact.  There is something be to said for a man who has the guts to look a woman in the eye...and then be bold enough to ask if he can buy her a coffee.  Also, honesty is a big turn-on.  No need to fall all over her with compliments, but a simple "I think you're attractive and I'd like to get to know you better" is so sincere.|`|rmEhNpHQaa	dont ask on yahoo|`|ZivgciCLaa	Be nice dont be a dack dont judge people on there looks either but of couse you will|`|DK8HijQQaa	uh well smile at here when she looks at u and if u hand here sumten grab here whole hand to take it instead of just grabbing the object|`|7RQDM1HGaa	What one girl likes another might not|`|OAaiT1zWaa	smile hold a hand the little things tuch her more such as a hug be nice and ask her out|`|RX5aY2aaaa	Talk to her a lot to maker her see your interested in her.  Also, a Valentine's day gift wouldn't hurt either ;)|`|5fFl7ikIaa	TOUCH her|`|CA9OFT4Waa	just talk to her, a girl doesn't like someone that comes on too strong, its actually a very big turn off and it makes us think you're a creeper, so take the simple route and ease onto it.|`|OT5J4U54aa	Write her really cute notes...just telling her how special she is and that your happy that you know her. Give her hugs when she's having a bad day. Say your shoulder's always open if she needs a good cry. Get her something cute for Valentines day...make her a card, buy her a card or something. Buy her a rose with a little cheerer up note!! Good Luck :)|`|SEfBwYiOaa	the best thing to do (also the hardest thing to do if you aren't completely bigheaded) is to just be yourself. this way nothing false is ever holding you back.....good luck with it pal|`|vuRKaTawaa	touch !!!!!!!!!!!!  always   eye contact   make her laugh   etc.  leave your friends to talk to her that will definitely work|`|WY9wxqzAaa	TALK TO HER! everyone hates shy guys. its kinna they guys responsibility to start the convo. its kinna the girls job to play "hard to get" and flirt sometimes, but ignore you at other times ect.     i love it when they get really flirty, like, they basically spell it out for you that they like you, and make it really odious  it makes me feel special when they talk about meaningful things. don't just say stuff like"whats up" say stuff like "oh, i heard you scored the winning goal in the soccer game, congrats!" have a reason to talk to her. make connections too!  also, be really fun! if you feel the convo is getting boring, stop it. i hate when guys ramble on with nothing to say just because they wanna talk to you.       i hope i helped somehow!   you should have that girl all to yourself in a month or two if you are trying hard enough!|`|YY5kGrwCaa	play around and joke around with her.|`|IQo3mNv0aa	Someone who doesn't try too hard and comes off kind and caring. We want a gentleman not a gigalo. Maybe say "hi" to her and try to approach her slowly and get to know her. Maybe ask to go get coffee or something. Please, no cheesy pick up lines. HAHA. Good luck with everything.|`|0kMrPvt3aa	Look into her eyes and smile, brush her lightly if you hand her something.  Pay loooads of attention to her, but don't be clingy.|`|zSdeMhvAaa	well it depends if she is into you or not. you gotta get her into you before you can really start flirtin a lot or she will think you are a creep! but i like it when a guy plays wit my hair.. or just will make me laugh.. any guy willing to talk to me i consider! Also u could tease her. this guy i rlly like teases me all da time and i think it is so cute. he makes me blush.. just that he always just is like heyy beth! i like your nails!  and in this rlly wierd voice. and he will just be like oh i hate your hair, no i dont jk i like it. i give him a odd look and he sais well what do u want me to say i love your hair and it is the most wonderful thing i have ever seen. it is the best hair ever.   just cute little stuff like that always makes me like a guy! and always brings a smile to my face!|`|sr3u8URNaa	well,you could start by looking at her strait in the eyes  talk to her like she is the only one you see  start a conversation with a smile  and never be afraid to just be silly!|`|ypNltKTCaa	try to make eye contact !  look at her face not her boobs!  laugh at anything funny but not a wierd stalkerish laugh!  if u are sitting with her and a nother girl walks up and starts to talk to you ignore her in the most polite way and pay as much attention to the gurl you like    DONT BE STALKERISH!|`|m0wPAmw5aa	when people tell me i look beautiful in words you dont hear often like georgous, amazing...etc. and when they notice the smallest detail like earings, necklace, ring, nail polish.. etc|`|hXFndli2aa	Well try talking to her about the class you both are taking together, im sure that will break the ice, and just keep having conversations with her everytime you have a class with her and then start flirting with make her want you.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Just be yourself, act natural, and remain calm. Start off by asking her how's her day going? If she seems interested in the class, you can start a conversation off by asking her something about the class.|`|94jDTdDzaa	Just tell them what they wanna hear.  Or just say somthing nice.|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	try walking her to class every now and then and then slowly walk with her more and more. also it is good to just become friends and then if she seems to want to be your friend then it's time to maybe ask her out. I hate it when i like a boy and he waits like a year before he asks me out, because i can't tell if he just wants to be friends or if he wants to be my boyfriend. also ask her how her day is going, if it isn't going well then try to cheer her up, but not with some lame joke. also what makes me melt is getting a little note with a cute poem on it or maybe if you are a good singer and know how to play the piano or guitar sing her favorite song but change it a little like if it says a girls name put hers in. take you time start with  talking work up to walking her to class and then end with the note or song then and the end of the note/song ask her out.|`|aWldCMwBaa	These are a few tricks I have up my sleeve! I hope you like it and I hope they're helpful! :D     Make her feel wanted and make her feel good.   Also, girls don't like wimpy and shy, and not confident guys!   NEVER say stupid stuff! That will just make her less attracted to you. Always be cool.   But don't try to hard because you might end up saying something stupid.  Don't be rude and sexist. Girls hate that! Girls can do anything if they put their mind to it!  last but not least, be relaxed, be cool, and have fun!           Good Luck!   Source(s):  I'm a girl!|`|1rNKZ1Liaa	gawd, I wish all boys asked questions like this, the world would be so much simpler! Okay about your question, if she is shy, then DO NOT make fun of her if she is popular than it MAY be okay but I wouldn't recommend it. If you two don't know each other already, just ask her something about the work you are doing, ask her for a pencil, for starters, make a joke about something ridiculous the teacher just said, then if she seems into it, after a couple days, get more in depth, catch her after class, and walk with her to lunch or to her next class, you could even ask her to join you at lunch, get to know her, when you two are close enough it would be so cute if you like randomly came over and hug her from behind (MAKE sure you avoid the boobs that would piss her off unless she is a ****) When you two are good Friends than ask her out to something, local concert, Coffee, sledding (yes even big kids sled, imagine it : Sledding down on a tube that is really too small (gigiddy) and then tumbling down laughing, cute right?)  OH MY GOSH and with Valentines day coming up, you have to give her a flower or something, like one rose would be so sexy!!!! but only if you two are far enough along that you feel comfortable with each other, cuz giving her a rose could actually ruin it if its too soon...but never fear, even if its after valentines day that you two end up together, get her a rose anyway and tell her that you are sorry you couldn't give it to her on valentines day. Or if there is a dance you could ask her to it!  Will you please be My lover??!! sigh  Just be yourself, don't brag, if you are an artist use it to your advantage singer or jock, use it to your advantage but DO NOT brag!  BE FUNNY, even if its stupid funny, the girl will probably find it endearing!!! As for what makes her melt? showing that you care, saying "I like your necklace" but only do that once or twice, too many times can make you seem like you are trying to hard to get some. Most girls like a cuddle, most like to be taken care of like making sure her scarf is covering her neck if its really cold outside (If it turns out you live in Florida I will be really angry). However some are more indepentant, but I doubt any girl wouldn't find that cute.  Really hope this helps, your question is so cute, it gives me faith that boys actually care, so maybe I will get my but off this seat answering questions on yahoo answers and get back out there  If you smell good and have clean hair and a clean body and you follow this advice, AND your own instincts you should be fine!|`|c4cwTJBkaa	slowly get to know her.... start making small talk about the little things..... then maybe after wile you clould exchange numbers and txt.. or talk. then again over time gradualy make it happen.. maybe go to the movies..... just be your self.... dont try too hard and use than manly charm=] al guys have it somewhere deep down:)|`|fTtkXFJLaa	the only way is to be nice to her.  stare at her sometimes and when she looks back at you look the other way.  don't flirt with other girls cuz then she might think you do the same with every other girl and find no interest in you.  talk to her in the hallways about school work and stuff.  remember: dont put too much pressure on her though it only makes her not like youu.  be playful.|`|AgI9HG7naa	make fun of her. It always makes girls blush, or just be funny.|`|yA6uH637aa	lol i agree with the first answer. but just joke always smile when she looks at you... probly will make her smile. but dont be weird. just be casual. be a guy lol.     good luck|`|oYqb4YPCaa	make jokes all girls like a good joke make her lough honestly i love a seance of humor love love love it i know strange but also when she needs something like paper give her some shell look at you as mini hero good luck|`|ZBo1LFMxaa	just be nice, and talk to her. don't flirt over facebook or anything like that, its a major turnoff
AA11085356	The only person that can answer that question is your girlfriend. Talk to her about it. Ask her if there was anything that happened that night that she didn't like, or didn't feel comfortable with. She can't expect you to read her mind like that. Maybe she was worried that things were going to go too far. Talk to her and find out what her boundaries are. Show her that you care about her and let her kno that you don't want her feel uncomfortable or rushed. I hope this helps.|`|rH31CwjMaa	lol wow fort it wer sum porn story there for a second lol|`|ALvp7YRuaa	it doesn't matter if you guys been goin out. just take it slow. i mean you were slow but don't do it without talking. first talk to her and see what she thinks and maybe she'll be happy that you guys talked and maybe you'll do it. but if not then just wait until she's ready. like they say it takes two to mingle not one.|`|tpvcJwfvaa	Talk to her about it, and be open.  If you can't communicate, then you can't do anything|`|VkFWgXaHaa	i would of said "DOOD WHY ARE YOU BEING SO AGRESSIVE!" but at the same time...7 months?!!! it looks like she dosnt have enough confidence or is still show to express herself! dont worry dude it is nice of to feel guilty and shows that you are sensitive towards caring for your GF...i would talk to her about it maybe? just try and break that boundary...because 7 months...is like so long dude.|`|Z2f5Ka6jaa	I don't think she was uncomfortable... but this was all going on in the movies? Maybe she didn't want to get into it at the movies! Where do you live that you have a movie theatre where you can lay down??  Again, I don't think she was uncomfortable, plus you've been dating for 7 months, it was probably just an awkward situation.  Did you ask her about it? Did she act WEIRD after all said and done?  EDIT: okay GOT IT.  I would just nonchanlantly apologize if you made her uncomfortable. She'll probably appreciate that!|`|Xxme8O6Maa	If she does not seem to be annoyed or anything, then it should be all right.  However, try to be a little more sensitive to her own needs.  You are both experimenting with your emotions and physical needs but be careful not to push too far, too fast.  One can get carried away when emotionally and physically caught in this type of web.  Just go as far as she will allow.|`|PTKPlcwdaa	talk about it and tell her your sorry|`|030f9f4c7056257d78f782e46f684510aa	7 months and youre embarrassed by this? sad relationship|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Just wait until tomorrow bro, if everything is normal and she talks to you like she always does..texts/ calls you when she does then she had no problem with it. Either that or she got over it, which works too :) so yea don't trip just find out tomorrow..If she does ignore you though or acts weird just ask her whats wrong, if she confronts you about that movie thing just tell her you were sorry and that you thought she was giving you mixed signals. Just that you were confused, and don't forget to apologize. good luck, hope that helped.|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Just rmemeber you always have to respect her body. Even though she didn't throw you off, these subtle signs prove that she felt uncomfortable. No, you didn't violate her. Don't ever forget to show respect for her body, though.|`|sDuIOUu1aa	Kinda sounds like she's missing with your emotions. That's the famous. Yes no yes no yes no yes NO.

Talk with her about it. If you two have been going out that long, you two should be comfortable with talking about that stuff. Ask how far is too far, and tell her how far you'd care to go (as long as it's not like "I'd love to have anal right now" sort of thing)|`|V4PMErjyaa	I think you're overanalyzing the situation.

No worries.    that happens to girls all the time.|`|pbPe614Raa	i think what you maybe should have done when that first occurred with her  changing her movements when you tried to touch her was to ask if she was comfortable and even actually ready for you to begin second base at that point of the relationship,if that happened to be the first time you touched her.anyway,i would recommend the same thing right now to just ask her if she was ok with that.    good luck=]|`|j4RZqTpvaa	dont feel guilty..if she feels like u violated her then she would have stopped making out with u..but she didnt so i dont think u should worry about it|`|KiG4EaOIaa	all i can say is ur a hella patient dude|`|mfhgQoNUaa	She sounds like she is very uncomfortable.  She may have been raised that sex is not allowed until marriage and although part of her is interested her upbringing is making her feel this is wrong.  Perhaps you should sit down and talk to her.  Rather than assuming try talking about your perception of what happened in a nonjudgmental way.  Let her know you are supportive of her feelings and don't want to pressure her and feel badly about the other night because this was not your intention.  You will get your answer a lot easier if done in a nonjudgmental way as she may feel awkward and embarrassed talking openly about this if she is brought up with these expectations.|`|tqu2SALHaa	Do not worry about a single thing this is not your fault nor her fault. Its Probably her hormones racing. This is one of the hardest things to explain. I actually am Surgeon, So i should be able to answer this, she wants you to feel you are loved by doing this but when it comes to the time that you are there she gets a rather surge of Uncomfort, thus is maybe just what she is doing but, I am 25, i have had the same experience as you.    Please i would like to hear from you, and if you have any updates and you are still confused feel free tp get in contact with me as any information that you give me will be classified and private.     So hear is my Email address the one that i am usually on,  markm2k8@hotmailco.uk|`|lxDOHwMwaa	ummm...gross?|`|rNjTHr36aa	sounds like she's interested and horny, but knows better than to give it up. keep going at the pace you're going. if she wants you to do anything, SHE'LL be the one to guide your hands where she wants them to be ;)|`|Y7X5fKK2aa	by seven months you should be getting some ***|`|T1sQd6A8aa	Seven months and that's all you've received?    Don't feel guilty..you should have already had sex.|`|wMJYscXtaa	uh normally when girls do that it means they stopped wanting you to do it. you should have just backed off|`|Me8JEgzpaa	Talk to her. Maybe it was just a spur of the moment thing during the movie. Maybe she wasn't ready for that kind of intimacy.|`|XTMNHuvDaa	girls r like that sometimes they want a guy to touch them then they change there mind so probably try not to do to much touching and more kissing and if she moves ur hand up there just let her dont do it yourself :)|`|MuTxi3Baaa	well...    i think it was her time of the month...    and wyl u wer feelin her breasts she just realised she didnt want it to get that far...    so she stopped responding...lol    sme shih appened with me n my ex...    w8 a week or 2...    try agen|`|D2DVSdQwaa	That sounded like some old person's sick fantasy|`|3211ed41e3e48685000da1909bc1332aaa	just let her know the truth. Say you didn't get her message and you didn't know exactly what she was trying to tell you by putting her hand on her breast.
5DJzp6bMaa	Sure its Normal|`|bn6ecUFnaa	the only reason hes telling you he loves you is bc he hasn't got all his ducks in a row drop his *** as soon as possible and be as harsh as possible , hatred for ones enemy makes you open your eyes to their falsehoods so go with gods speed|`|L8kSyfThaa	Only when they are way older than you and you are constantly picking up coors bottles full of spit!  lol...lol...|`|PvAIY7OPaa	The girl friend dumped him so that is why he is around!
5DJzp6bMaa	Does it matter what a bunch of Strangers Think If You cant Handle a little Issue like This You need to Become a Monk and Move to The Hills|`|Jk9Q8Zmkaa	She doesn't want to admit it man. Look at it this way... put yourself in her shoes, if your marriage or relationship was on the line and your answer depended on it would your answer be "I dont swear"?. If she was telling the truth she would realize how important her answer is to you and ease your suspicions by telling you exactly what happened.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Yes she is sleeping with him and the fact she didnt swear means she is praying for jesus to get u out of the way so may be she does not want to upset jesus.    Anyways, she/he are at it and u better get out before the getting is right!|`|IvMPh09baa	oh blah blah blah... this sounds sooo childish.  are you seriously asking this... how would anyone on here know, none of us know your fiance... seriously, man.  grow some balls and act like a man here.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	If he was 'just a friend' then there wouldn't be any reason for her to hide that from you.     When people keep secrets and hide things, it's because there is a reason , they don't do that if they are being honest.    If you really feel she is cheating, then break up with her.|`|b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	It really doesn't matter whether she did or didn't.  What you have learned is that you cannot trust her.  It's time to move on.      I know it sounds callous, but do you want to married ten years with three children when you realize you never could trust her?|`|BZMPax7Naa	Dig down.  If you don't believe that you will be able to trust her you might as well call it off.  Once that seed is planted it will always be there.|`|6fPfKfLVaa	You're kidding, right?  It is ok for you to screw around BUT you're going to call her on it?  You BOTH need to be faithful to each other or move on to a relationship where you will be.  OR better yet - don't get into a any relationships at all because apparently, you are just interested in screwing around.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Well, the whole "do you swear/i don't swear" thing is immature, and should be dropped. Don't base something on that conversation. If you really don't trust her, you shouldn't be with her.|`|L8kSyfThaa	todays your lucky Day  HONEY...  You see me .... Good ... its me ! You can tell me .... casuse I know you!|`|AA11946996	I think that you should really re-think getting Married at this point! Already this crap! Miss me man! Just wait until you really get Married, oh what fun you will have starting out like this homie! Have fun with that!|`|GvaaTnExaa	well if she was sneaking around she must be trying to hide something from you ...if he is a so called friend then what the hell would she need to sneak around for ....i say u take ur ring back and kick her *** to the curb cuz she is just NO GOOD....im srry i don't play this type of **** **** all that cheating **** ....i mean if she tryna hide the man then summin just aint right at all....tell her she should introduce him to you ....so all of you guys can go on a big double date =)|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If she "didnt do anyting" why does she have to senak around about it? Let this one go.
PvAIY7OPaa	The other lady dumped him or he is still with her and bored by now and he wants to keep you as a booty call.He is not interested at you at all just "booty call" otherwise if he is serious he would be upfront and tell you but he knows he is playing his cards right and you are falling for his manipulation since u asked this question.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Well, maybe he isn't up to anything. Maybe he's just trying to have a civil relationship with your for the sake of your kids.    Just keep it civil and if he is up to something that concerns you, I'm sure you will hear about it in time.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	He's confused.  He isn't over you yet.  He isn't sure the new girl will work out.  He's testing the waters, to see where you stand, trying to keep all options open.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Hes happy in Life and Content, Your Seeing him as You Couldnt make him thats why You thing its strange Behavior|`|IvMPh09baa	he's still trying to be everything you need... he obviously likes to feel needed by you and the more that he makes himself useful in your life the more he thinks it will be harder for you to move on from him.  If you simply just tell him you don't really need him to fix your bulb and you can do it yourself, then maybe he will get the hint.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Maybe he is happy and not up to anything.  Let him do odd jobs if it makes your life easier.|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	He's not over you.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	he wants to paint a happy and cheery picture for you because he is not too happy with things right now,but he is embarassed to let you know...he still wants to kep you hanging by a thread too...maybe you will possible forgive him and yall might live happily ever after,,, anyway, thats what I think
G1boIrFuaa	Contact different halls and ask them.  They'll be able to tell you how much space you need.  70 isn't a very big number, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a space.
nyylb6qUaa	If she is your friend, then be there for her no matter what. Show your concern to her drinking. See how she acts, and if it offends her, just tell her that you love her unconditionally, no matter what, and you are always there for you. Believe me, I went through this kind of stuff. Just be there for her no matter what. May God Bless.|`|MbHwygxbaa	Well first of all how old is she? Just show your concern, but dont point fingures, just be like I trust you, I just want to know why you are suddenly intrested in this
afSqgYBZaa	Nothing really.    Before we got married, our fights were about who's turn it was to sleep over and why he didn't tell me he was going to the same bar as me.     Now, we just argue about when to start having babies and why I can't go shopping again - because we need to save. Our lovelife has suprisingly improved greatly though, I guess it's the comfort level.|`|IvMPh09baa	about me?hmm... I guess patience, I've got ALOT more patience, not by choice... but because I have to in order to maintain a relationship.      My husbands hours at work changed just a couple months after marriage, and he was promoted which sounds good but actually to me its bad and I'd rather him take a step down..  He works ALL the time, and puts in 60 hours a week and I NEVER EVER see him.  We work opposite schedules already, but the increased hours makes it even worse.  Our relationship lies solely on text messaging 5 days a week.  Fun! not....|`|hAz30eGVaa	My husband let me see the lazy jerk that he truly is.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I'm more patient. I used to get mad over little things, like if he forgot bandaids or something that wasn't even important. I've come to realize that I was stupid and should have focused on what was actually important.    We also get along better and are more understanding of each other. Our personalities compliment each other very well.     He cooks more now that we're married (didn't live together before marriage, however I did spend the night a lot at his house.)|`|DtrdTV87aa	When we were bf and gf we use to sit on the phone all night and talk until one of us fell asleep. Now we can't even hold a conversation for a good period of time. He's always tried are stuck into ESPN. Also We use to couldn't wait to skip school to go sneak and have sex, now we have to plan to have sex. When it was just us two we didn't have to think twice about sex we just did it when ever. Now that we have kids. They pretty much just take over. My daughter just turned two yesterday and if she see us kissing are holding hands she flips out and starts trying to attack him saying mine, my mommy.|`|an1EMiFkaa	EVERYTHING!!!|`|P9wE9XZlaa	I thought it has changed for good till i realise it is all the same.....same stuff but i am more matured and taking it well|`|8lInBfqfaa	Everything. I shouldn't have gotten married.|`|QRSRJ7U1aa	OMGosh! Almost every thing has changed over the life of our marriage in 1962.  From our wrinkles, to our thought patterns, to our way of relating to the world and to each other.       We were grungy little kids in blue jeans when we met playing in the weed patches of life.  We did not even know who we were yet. We dated through high school and did not have a clue what life was all about.  Even then he was a sweet good looking guy and I knew he would be a good husband.      He went off into the service in the 50's and I waited for him but I was a real jealous little brat and often I'd play mind games on him.  When he came home in the early 60's he convinced me to that we needed to get married.  We didnt have the preverbial pot or the window to throw it out of, but we got married anyhow.      And the next 10 years were just about what we could expect.  We had two children by 1963 and found out as they entered school that both of them were dyslexic.  We both "breathed and ate books" so it was sooo hard for us to accept that they had this to deal with.  And we had to grow up.      He did this much faster than I did.  I soon needed anitdepressants.  My husband had to work 10 hour days (nights actually) lugging 400 lb sides of beef in a packing house when we were raising our kids and I was alone with their difficulties way to much of the time.  My family lived 60 miles away and were not the kind to come for visits.  My Mom was still raising little ones of her own.  And both his parents died very young.  He lost his Mom his 2nd year of high school leaving him at 16 the oldest of the four still in the house.  And his dad died broke of cancer before our kids entered kindergarden.  My husband became a trucker in the early 70s and then he was away from home except for Sundays.  It took a big toll on both of us.    In the mid 70s our kids went into teen age rebellion and were still in it when they moved with us to the country in the mid 80s. Between then and now we have lost our oldest child to his horrid depression.  After that I went over the road with my husband for over 5 years.  It healed our marriage and helped me over come the death of our son.  I got off the truck when we gained our only grandchild who was born with aspergers.  My daughter and grandchild have become my next dearest friends  after my spouse now that my mom pass on over 8 years ago.    There have been so many changes, some forced upon us some that were mistakes, and some improvement undertaken like going back to college in my thirties.....  I hardly recognize the people we used to be.    The religious teaching about grace and God's mercy that I scoffed at as a child I now pray for daily.   The ire and resentment of wrongs that once brought me to my feet with fists waving now send me to my knees with prayers for all who need Gods help.  I am not any where close to being saintly but I do turn off the TV when it shows me nothing of the values I endorse.     My heart seems deeper and wider as I age and almost nothing shocks me or embarasses me now unless I am caught off guard by something that pops out of my own mouth or shows up unintended in something I myself do.  I can back pedel pretty darn good if I believe I need to.|`|u1uECuFNaa	What hasn't is a better question.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	The only thing that has changed in my husband is that he has gotten more mature over the yrs other then that nothing.    He is still the same very sweet and wonderful man i married.    I have also gotten more mature over the yrs so that is the only thing that changed about me.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	we became more mellow|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	my weight cause i had two children|`|GWRP3vLQaa	We both changed in many ways; mostly we grew together, happily. But we would both have changed had we not married, too. That is what life is all about.

cb5522ea5bac3ee4d8f1779895290ac6aa	Don't try to feel pressured, just tell him that you feel like things are moving way too fast and you want to take it slow and get to know him first.  Tell him that you don't even really know him yet and he doesn't know you, if he's a good guy which I hope he is, he'll take it easy and try to get to know you at your own pace.  If not and if he tries more stuff and you have to tell him twice or more to lay off, then you know that he's NOT a keeper and just wants to get in those fancy pants.  He's a guy and believe it or not it's the only thing they want.  So don't give it up so easily, give it up to the highest bidder that is willing to give you a large amount of love, commitment, and trust.  Also it would be good if he's a hard worker and not a lazy bum.  Well that's all I've got to say.  I hope all goes well for you & good luck!!!|`|3CHSHmPbaa	**** that *****   he jus want sex  find somebody else  love/lust isnt a one time thing|`|ZaeJptPoaa	Sit on his face.

I don't think it's gonna work out. Maybe you could hook up with a guy closer to you distance wise i mean. Sorry.|`|MG7CLjtjaa	He just wants sex. Dump him, you're not ready for an older boyfriend. Find a nice guy closer to your age... who won't pressure you into stupid "phone sex'.|`|fotfHo7Aaa	yeah well if you are like 14 or 15 possibly 16 hes just USING YOU!  The SAME EXACT thing happened to me :/    please just move on before you get hurt and used liek I did|`|okeqhoLPaa	dont trust him love    hes playing you|`|ZGMNIUw7aa	sorrry to say .  i think he was just trying to get with you .  because he obviously knew there  was no way to have a steady relationship  with the distance between you two.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Sounds like you are playing with fire, he is older, he Does want to have phone S>E>X.  Why you feel special is you are flattered with the attention of a cute older man, many bad men play this to their advantage and you will be the one hurt by it.    I advise you to stay away from him, while the "bad boy" is alluring the amount of pain you could be left with is not funny.      edit: just like I thought you feel you need to defend him, because you WANT to keep in this relationship even though you know it will not be good for you.  You are a teen your desires are very strong and you really want to ignore the warning bell that was ringing in your head.    Hint: Never ignore the warning you will only regret it, but reading your defense I doubt you will listen and for that I am sorry.|`|ZPDb4KRXaa	Can he really be considered a boyfriend? I mean you two were together not that long, and you talk yeah... but how can you trust him when you don't know him well? How do you know he isn't just getting off talking to you then flirting with all the girls there? I say it isn't a good idea, but don't give into phone sex until you think it's right|`|oCcRn93uaa	if he's pressuring you to do something your not comfortable with yet, then dump him. && dont you think he could be cheating on you cuz you said no? think about it, your both far away from eachother, your young he's older and he could be doing something with other girls while your not with him because he cant get it with you. I say he's not worth keeping, try finding somone who's closer to where you live :)|`|KFj0RfEUaa	Well im a guy and this happened to me be for. This is what you do if you like him so much and he is 18 then he could come to visit you. And if you are not ready for phone sex then tell him im only whatever age and that i want to be with you buy im not ready for phone sex. If he says ok fine or something in that category and he sounds mad or depressed then he isn't the one to be with. Because as you say (rape me) the you may be pregnant and screwed for life so good luck hope he makes the right choice

P8CBDLiKaa	Hey, you've tried your best; he obviously knows the dangers and consequences.  There comes a time to just drop the subject, and this may be that time.  Like any other addict, he's not going to change his habits unless and until he really wants to and that may never happen.|`|3m8JgWj1aa	have him start out slowly, going on a 15 minute walk 2-3 times a day, then have him start one day at 9,000 calories, then the next day 8,000 and so on and so forth so his body has time to adjust|`|AA12223669	You may have a solid education on nutrition but you don't in psychology. 101 - you can't change a person, they have to want to change themselves. Maybe he'll never figure that out and he will end up killing himself through his bad habits, but thats not your burden to bear. I would just stay friends with him, make him comfortable around you and maybe he'll confide in you that he wants to change. Pushy athletic people are just annoying to fat people ... just as he's probably annoying to you.
QnQmjqtqaa	Some guys don't take "hints" so you have to TELL them to stop. But "why" he doesn't get the hint could be a number of things. My opinion is that our culture is teaching guys that if they are "persistent" they will eventually get the girl. Persistence = How Much They Really Care. Or he's just a stalker, I don't know. So now you have to stop being "nice" and tell him leave you alone or it will continue.|`|f22c717f4305f58996e51a2c81964907aa	He got to attached, you gotta tell him straight up. hes stupid for not getting ur hint but you just have to tell him to stop, if ur nice about it he will still continue (if hes really dumb) so you gotta be a little assertive with him.|`|t3IH1hryaa	fffuuuuuuuu|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	Some guys become so infatuated that they can't pick up any hints being thrown at them short of "I DON'T LIKE YOU".    Or some guys (like me) are just bad at picking up subtleties. (you just need to be really blunt with our type)|`|DK8HijQQaa	just say please im trying to be mean but i really dnt wanna go out with u and please stop texten me|`|QMeForAGaa	hes stupid and cant take a hint  thats seriosly it  sum guys just dont get it  hes just that dum|`|nOO7b5snaa	what you need to do is tell him to leave you alone. if it gets serious you should get a restraining order.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	Well you can't say "I don't like him anymore than a friend." You gotta say, look you're a nice guy (if he is) but this isn't working out. I don't think we should be friends. Please stop calling me. I've had to say that b/c he couldn't get the hint either and I tried to be friends. So. yeah stop replying block his number but I'd do the one before first then if he keeps bugging then get his number blocked.|`|N9DW9tpPaa	if it's that bad call the police. otherwise men win women over more with persistance. i know old people that met this way. men get nothing if we play hard to get i know womn wonteven aproach you unless you look rich, or are someshallow expectation you happened to get lucky enough to meet visuall, i was single for twenty years for being too nice women promote jerk behavior then breed moe jerks and everyone wonders why people are so hard to deal with. my girlfriend of five years still can't believe how dumb other women are at chosing dates|`|r3uKj1Azaa	He's either desperate and thinks he's got nothing to lose by pursuing you or he's in love with you and can't let you go.|`|xbMLtXOuaa	just keep avoiding him, he will get it eventually, if that doesnt work get a couple of your other guy friends to take care of him for you|`|4j7qchZyaa	congrats u have a stalker lol   ah im kidding just tell him out straight and if he still keeps bugging   u kick him in the balls   the guy will get the piont ha|`|AwXQ4q6taa	Guys are stupid. Like really that's the only reason.  No offense guys I love you all =)  They're just not the sharpest knife in the drawer.   He'll get it eventually just give him more time.

I hate when girls say that because I know it's not true. They don't like you, they find you repulsive, but they also want to let you down in a nice way that makes it hard to hate her. I'd rather one say "F You" so then I could make fun of her with my friends later on. That's just the way guys are. All egos.

Remember its only highschool and you have other things to worry about then boyz|`|3ctchU2faa	Expect some pain, because you are not used to having something that large in there (or at least thrusting as much as a real penis does).  Don't expect amazing fireworks and ecstasy, because developing a technique that good takes practice and time.  Make sure that while you are having sex, still be respectful of each others limitations. Make sure you let him know what feels good to you and what doesn't, and above all: DON'T FAKE IT. If you don't finish, no biggie. If he doesn't, no biggie either. Take your time and fun discovering each other.    Ps. Use a condom. You CAN get pregnant the first time.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	Well it expect it to feel uncomfortable because your tight it will hurt, bleed but not alot , after a couple of times it will feel nice. I say you do some four play so you can get wet and ease the pain..nothing is worse than a dry vagina on your first time OUCH|`|dCmSA6r2aa	its not that good the first time  if you won't date him why would you have sex with him  the best way to kill a friendship is to sleep with him|`|180rE9rGaa	unbearable pain.|`|3rDbLSZBaa	a little blood, a little pain, alot of messups but learning moments|`|0oiz1hySaa	AGE DOESNT MATTER ONLY LOVE|`|RvVvaVsAaa	the first time for what? sex? or real love? or a relationship? this is VERY vague..  if its sex you are referring to, you REALLY shouldnt do it. you should wait untill marriage. its so easy to think that this is the right time and youll regret it later when you could have gave it to your future husband.. not to mention pregnancy and std risks..    and if this is something you ARE going to do..    i have one question for you to ponder:    Are you in love with him? or do you have ANY doubts?|`|sr3u8URNaa	just dont expect the best.everyone is a little weak on their first time|`|dcovK6oqaa	are you planning in having sex well at least get birth control and he should get condons. Is he willing get responsible if he gets you pregnant?  and it would be good to see a doctor just to make sure that non of you have a sexual transmitted disease.|`|PQjPq6Ddaa	i thought that too, but now i havea four year olde from me and my friend practicing... please wait and we did use protection|`|OpOm35gJaa	from what my sister told me its not that good the first time and younger guys are cocky(all sexual jokes aside)|`|SFoMSEpgaa	absolutly nothing, lol, the first time sucks! So just wait till your outta college|`|ww9k3Bk7aa	first a little pain then you'll feel pleasure.   if you wanna talk email me im 14   swimchick0407@yahoo.com|`|BeTBLiCoaa	The first time it depends on how experienced he is! if he knows what he is doing you will like it! Use a lot of KY|`|rmHDABOzaa	I assume you're talking about sex. First off, I just want to make it clear that I do not advocate teen sex. Do not have sex if you are not capable of raising a child.     I will however give you the following information as kids will be kids.     First, make sure you are both disease free. It may be your first time, but are you sure it's his?    Use birth control. I highly recommend using both the pill and condoms. Remember, condoms will not prevent the spread of some STD's, such as herpes and warts. Please go to Planned Parenthood for more information.    In terms of what you can expect...well, being that it is your first time, it may be uncomfortable. Even if you use tampons, your hymen may be partially intact, so there may be some bleeding. The more foreplay you have, the more comfortable you will be. You may want to use lubrication. If he is a virgin or has not had sex in a while, it may be a very short lived experience. Make sure you pee right away after wards to reduce your chances of  urinary tract infection.    ETA: I just read your updated question. Please don't have sex. You're obviously not ready. Sex is something intimate that should be shared by people who have made a strong committment to one another. You will likely look back and regret this. You can never get your first time back.|`|RZV0fkuSaa	if you are both virgins, it's not going to be anything great, it'll make a GREAT memory but it wont be like in the movies. He'll have a hard time finding it and keeping it in. I laughed alot because i was nervous when he couldn't find the hole, it'll be special, and it may hurt for you keep a towel under you for the blood. You'll have to stop after that and will be sore for a little and you will bleed for a couple of days.    If he's not a virgin then he'll know what to do, and it should feel good,  until he "pops your cherry" then the same thing will happen, about the not feeling good.|`|mNODXL8Uaa	It would  be a little awkward for the first few minutes...then you will get more comfortable with it...i will probably feel weird too, but u will get used to it|`|Q8iCsLzFaa	pain at first - but if you relax you just might enjoy it.    general concensus is that the first time is not fun, however my first time was great.   Although i didnt know what to expect or what i was doing , since i l felt really comfortable with the guy i was with, i enjoyed it     i noticed you amended your facts - if you have no strong feelings for the guy why not wait for someone you really like - you'll enjoy it much more and when u meet ure special guy he may appreciate your waiting for someone like him :-)|`|L7QH81Uaaa	It sounds like you are in a hurry just slow down. The first time is really not good and you will regret it later. And just because there are no risks of stds it does not mean that there are not other risks. Like pregnancy and you have your whole life ahead of you, you do not want to be a young teen mother. Protection is never 100%! Good Luck with your decision hopefully you make the right one for you.
UCeXWLrQaa	You can't make a girl like you.  If she keeps pushing you off, move on.|`|tF80XoLDaa	dude i believe every woman can be with any guy if you are in the exact situation they like.  i had the same problem, exempt it was with a girl i didn't knew and i saw in the mall every friday. Did you saw the movie hitch? well that movie is real man! i didn't believe it but it was true. that girl happened to be the daughter of a friend of my mother and one day she came to my house and i was like "i don't care about anything" but when i saw her i said to my self "make this night worth it" and i talked to her and was nice to her and bla bla bla bla. that night nothing happened, one day i was walking outside a someone touched my back and when i turned to see who it was it was her and she kissed me.   so my advice is to be completely your self and be nice to her, and tell her what you feel for her DIRECTLY.  ps don't try to impress her doing stupid things, and don't drink or smoke|`|m5NV1GBUaa	Talk to her.|`|AA12186207	You can't change teh way she feels and if you keep bugging her you're goign to come off as a crreeper!    She's just not that into you.|`|8SEVTKz5aa	u cant  i think she just dont like u  give up, move on  like others =/|`|SzsrajV4aa	You can't change a person. They will do that themselves.    Be yourself and find someone that will treat you as well as you would be willing to treat them.|`|ip7CtK0faa	You are not a God you cannot change people!  Move on because it's kinda creepy to pursue someone who has not reciprocated to you the same feelings! Some women like the thrill of a chase. But back off a bit and let her chase you.|`|PTKPlcwdaa	she doesnt like you, go for another girl|`|YY5kGrwCaa	just leave her alone she might already have someone.|`|XyCbJGYqaa	Just try to be nice to her and listen to her become her friend first|`|C90bta8Saa	You can't change people into what you want them to be! Try to get to know other girls. You will find someone that is just for you that you do not have to change!|`|OT5J4U54aa	You can't. You have to respect that she's just not into you and move onto someone else. Good Luck :)|`|dcovK6oqaa	well you can't because she already told you that she won't go out with you. the best thing that you can do is date other women. you never know perhaps you will find someone better.|`|TnnFTLQXaa	You just think you're in love, she obviously doesn't like you, knock it off, and stop being a creep.     But if  you still want to keep trying there is one thing that you can do that will make her fall head over heels. First, figure out where her room is, climb a tree, and look in the window and watch her undress. Then when she has all of her clothing off, knock on the window and wave. Chicks dig that.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	Yo there's this movie, "she's just not that into you" sorry she pretty much said it. It happens. If you're a muscular dude and she likes scrawny guys, then it's not gonna happen. She might not ahve told you her likes, but she told you she didn't like YOU. Hate to break it, you sound like a good guy.     Now if you wanna find out what her type is which I'm sure you do since you asked this question after she gave you an answer, then find out. If she likes muscular guys, then if you're skinny you better hit the gym. If you dress preppy and she likes skater guys then you better change the look  If she likes guys that wear cologne you better invest and get some.  If she likes to read books and you just play video games, then read some books  Honestly though looks are in the eyes of the beholder If you have brown eyes and she likes green eyes you don't have a shot, nothing personal just not her thing. But maybe you can show some change but don't change yourself for anyone. Just find someone that'll like you for you. Trust me it works. Be confident. I've seen a lot of this happen amongst friends, workers, etc. Just really take the hint and bounce. Or find out honestly with noooooooo holding back why doesn't she like you. But you gotta be for real mature for the answer not just phishing for the answer (I know people like that that can't handle the truth) She might tell you. She doesn't wanna ruin the friendship, she's a lesbian, she's dating someone else, she's WAITING for someone particular to ask her out, she's racist, she's not into dating her race, etc soooooo many reasons but at the end of the day really she's just not into YOU. at this time or probably always. This happened on Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Xander asked Buffy to the prom and like out for real and her excuse was she didn't wanna ruin the friendship, but really she was dating A VAMPIRE, which was so wrong since she's a vampire SLAYER. I also saw on "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead" Kenny the loser brother fixed himself up and the girl he liked saw that at the end (Nicole) the sister's friend and it was implied they were gonna hook up. so he got mature.     I dont' know you or the situation so this isn't gonna help, just take everyone's answer's with a grain of salt. Good luck!!!!|`|P85LVLCTaa	you can't really.  just treat her well, be yourself and that's the best you can do. most time can't change how people feel unfortunately, good luck!|`|PIxJ1Ljgaa	She doesn't like you. And she probably never will. You're just not her type. So get over it and find another girl. You'll find one, don't forget half the worlds population is women.|`|gX82JV2Yaa	Give up find someone else or do something crazy like egg her house|`|S3pgtJGpaa	Well, don't force her to like you. First, try to develop a friendship. Ask her about some of the things she likes, and if she likes something you like, you can tell her that.|`|NoT3WGaEaa	I'm sorry to say this dude but you're going to have to move on. You shouldn't try to convince someone to give you a chance. Trust me the relationships will have a lot of problems.|`|VydFKOFBaa	you cant force it|`|onaVkZ0Faa	well first off don't get obsessive it will scare her even more   n idk just b urself aorund her more|`|AA12223669	You can't change the way a person feels just because you want them to feel a different way than they do. You have to accept that she doesn't feel the same way you do. Once you accept this, the confidence might be a turn on for her and she might see you differently. But right now you sound a little desperate and that is a big turn off to girls.|`|8xd5r7wraa	Your best bet is to talk to her, talk to her friends,or  talk to your friends that are friends with her. getting close to her or just talking to her will branch out into a bunch of things. talking to her often can create a friend ship and maybe you could do something with your friends and hers so you guys hang out at least somewhat.. just become her friend or talk to her|`|bn6ecUFnaa	i salute you sir  may you go with the gods at your back|`|74c9ec3bd6acfe124b9052ed73ac2d94aa	Ok, hang out with her losely, and not always. Definantly dont throw compliments at her all the time be honest. If your really ment to be you should just be yourself, theres no one else you can be.|`|zlsEYZBKaa	I really think that there is no way to make her feel the same way. You cannot make someone fall in love with you. But you could try to make her jealous. She may no love you, but she might like the attention you give her, try to get with one of her friends and see how she acts. She might get frustrated and try to get with you. I hope this works. :) good luck!|`|3211ed41e3e48685000da1909bc1332aaa	Just ask her if she can please give you a chance. That you promise you wont mistreat her and that you know how to treat a lady..|`|Hk6YoJHmaa	Well, it totally seems like you like her, which to me is so sweet!!!  Sometimes, at least in the beginning, you wont be able to "hang out with her". But if you see her, say her name, smile, start some kind of conversation.  If she is in some kind of sport or club, talk to her about it.  Sound interested.  The terrible fact is, you cant change how she feels. She may not understand the extremity of your feelings yet.  Us girls can be rather dense.  But sometimes, you have to understand, if its not meant to be then its not meant to be, that's that.  I really hope this works out for you and you sound like you really care.  That's exactly what a girl SHOULD want in a guy.  And maybe she doesn't even deserve you!! GOOD LUCK! i hope this helps you!|`|pY12abGgaa	maybe you should do something like in the notebook ^-^  all you have to do  is get her on a ferris wheel with some other guy  and then climb up it  and then hold on to the bar at the top  and tell her you will let go if she doesnt go out with you  then she will and realize your a nice guy  lmfao yeah its dangerous...but its the only idea i got [x    Good Luck x|`|Eo4P2s3yaa	You can't change how someone else feels. That's crazy talk.|`|2PmdvFoBaa	try talking to her just start out slow like if u see her say hi and nothing else.then as time goes by u start saying more than just hi and maybe shell come around...|`|RphzrNR1aa	well you can't chang the way a person fells. so mabey it is just not ment to be.sorry.|`|esJpBtEdaa	Talk to her. Find out what she likes and dislikes-basic stuff.  Dont try too hard and just be yourself!|`|f6e53f0beb237c748d386744a45e180faa	you probably can't. So now just show her what she's missing and make her regret it. And when she does make sure she has to work to get to you now, not the other way around.|`|tHYaq4rJaa	u dont unless u want to completely change urself so shed be in love with someone u arent and u deserve better than that|`|IZKBRqp7aa	if she doesnt like you then there probably isnt much you can do unfortunately. the harder you try the more you will most likely push her away. i would give up on this one and go for someone else. there are many girls out there and im sure you will find one who is right for you^_^|`|o4QRCMueaa	your infatuated, two options, 1. try too get to know her better by joining in on some of her group conversations and then talk to her when she isn't in a group  2. get over it and find another girl my friend, its a tough I life I know|`|AHLUW1HNaa	I hope you find someone that likes you just the way you are :] Are you sure she doesn't want to hang out with you? Maybe she's playing hard to get..       Be yourself:]    I hope you get what makes you happy|`|AA10733790	You can't convince a person to like you.  They will like you or not like you whether you can persuade them or not.    Find someone who already is interested in you.  Don't put yourself at someone's else mercy.
AVShSjzpaa	If you truely feel neglected write your mum a heart felt letter and that will wake her up or at least get her to constructively address the issue rather than calling you silly.|`|6gK5dzTdaa	you're spoiled rotten and now you're pouting because you are no longer the center of attention.  Poor baby.    Get a hobby and grow up.
c5UAa65qaa	If he does, I'd let him know how you feel, and ask him his motivations for doing so.  It sounds like he just wants to show off - and while that probably doesn't indicate any lingering feelings on his part, is that really worth the cost of an invitation that could go to someone you'll both be happy to see there without any mixed emotions?|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	Obviously she is married and is probably happy with her life. Don't let jealousy affect your life. All my ex's are my friends and will attend my wedding. I still love them all, as friends, and if my fiance wasn't cool with it, then he simply wouldn't be the right man for me to marry. Trust is a very important thing. Believe me, she is not intrested in your man, and i'm sure he is not intrested in her either.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	They don't talk on a regular basis, to me this suggests that they are not close friends and unless you are planning a really massive affair then that eliminates her from the guest list. If it does come up, out her name on a secondary guest list- you know the one you use for filling up spaces left by those that couldn't make it from the first round of invites. And get to know her, she's still friends wih your fiance so theres a good chance you might actually like her and become friends with her yourself. I get along quite well with my fiances ex even though I still don't get what he saw in her!|`|G1boIrFuaa	If she's married, I'd say its ok.  He's probably just nervous that you'll be worked up about her being there, but since he was at hers, I'd say its not a problem.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	Not a good idea sweetie unless you want to start divorce proceedings very very early.|`|7CKipTZOaa	If everyone is on good terms, but if the idea bothers you let him know. A girl my fiancee was with will be coming to our reception and the way I see it, its our wedding but I understand where your coming from. I'm also inviting a friend who I'm quite close to that I dated for a while. We both have only eyes for eachother now. All the best for your big day|`|3N3IXFfhaa	well my boyfriend has the same hting. and my answer is NO NO NO & NO WAY! dont do it honey. just cuz she is married doesnt mean anything. and dont do it especially if you will be uncomfortable. its your day not hers. he shouldnt want to invite her anyway. good luck and congrarts|`|sMUiGFPraa	I won't even read the whole thing. HELL NO! Why would he want his high school sweetheart at your wedding? Not to mention how that might make her feel as well as you. I am sure her ex's wedding isn't on her things to do list.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	seems like you feel uneasy about it.  If you are not comfortable you should talk to him about it.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I would say that's a big, fat NO.|`|7xMy4jmFaa	Well I thought right away no, but Im not in your shoes. If she is happily married and I say happily for a reason then its probably safe. But its your day and if you think it will cause you stress then I would say no. If|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	What's the big deal?    If they are on good terms and she clearly doesn't still have feelings for him, then there should be no reason why she shouldn't be counted as one of his "friends" just because they once had a relationship...in HS no less.|`|ScHW4842aa	I cannot believe that you even are considdering allowing this. You  are  nuts.|`|w4kEwcpdaa	What the hell. I know you ain't asking that girl if you do you might not be saying i do.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	I don't think it's a good idea to invite her.  She's not a friend of yours, and she's more of an acquaintance to him.  He might feel obligated to invite her b/c she invited him to hers, but you can tell him that it's not necessary to have a quid pro quo here.  One reason her wedding was likely expensive is b/c she invited people she didn't need to like her ex-bf.  I think you should prune her off the wedding list so as not to drive up costs.    FWIW, my husband and I did invite my most recent ex-boyfriend to our wedding but that's because he and my husband are very good friends.  You are not friends with his ex, so it's not necessary nor a good idea to invite her.|`|nqINitkmaa	Shes married, hes getting married, they are just friends, I don't see a problem with it.|`|w1necKzYaa	HELL NO i would not invite her and if has a problem with it too damn bad!
0Sn50ouNaa	Be completely honest with her, because if you feel something deep toward one another, things should be said, not hidden...|`|VhdRfsD1aa	Shoot...  forget about the beach   if i were u i would totally do that...  a girl like that is not trustworthy   she doesnt deserve to be treated good   u should move on to a better one   i know its hard to do that   but once u get over it   everything will heal   and you will be refreshed. :]|`|gXlT2cBkaa	Ask her where you stand with her  and what this other guy means to her
jt4PVBKkaa	lover of crackers?  Who feels sweaty?  who needs his blankie?  Resident of the creepy people?  i wonder what day it is?  i see a bird?  i hear a chicken clucking?  who enjoys eating cheese?        that was a weird question
5DJzp6bMaa	Get a Divorce|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You can't make someone stay if they want to go. You can't fix her pain. You can be a friend and walk with her as she goes through this trial in her life.|`|lN5d688gaa	let him go and you will survive.

I married a wonderful lady who knew in advance that I had a business with my ex wife. She didn't seem to care one bit until we married. Then all the sudden she wanted me to open up another business, add her to my will immediately to prove I loved her, add her to my 401 to prove I loved her. I could go on and what was a happy moment has now turned into the marriage from you know where. No communication and very sad time for all of us. People change when they get married. I am not saying I did anything wrong either but I have changed so much to make her feel secure that I finally threw in the towel. Most people will be shocked to here this because they see us out in public but in the house, she breaks dishes ETC. Be with your friend and remind her that you are available for her anytime, anywhere. That's what friends are for.|`|AA10436595	It takes two people to have a marriage.  It only takes one to want out.  As hard as it may be, think of it this way.  Would you really want to be with someone who didn't want to be with you?
HH90Eghaaa	Because you are holding on to your hate! So hes always on your mind!    Best approch is to go out and meet new people! One good way to do this is to join a club/ gym or organization! Its a great way to meet people who share similar interests as you!|`|3ctchU2faa	Now that you've let it off of your chest, let the anger go.  You are a strong person and you can move on from him. Get out and live your life instead of capital letter yelling here, and go be a single girl :)|`|r8owV9esaa	hope it made you feel better..skrew him!|`|dcovK6oqaa	perhaps you should date other guys so you can forget him and if you can't talk to some one.|`|AdTnizwOaa	Ah..yeah I can relate,  i wanna forget about this guy so badly but i catch myself ...falling for him? :[ I had a crush on this guy for a year and then he got a girlfriend..it really hurt... but i want to forget it ..forget him but i can't.    Your version seems to be a little more upsetting and advanced, (from your little squabble up there..) Okay, as much as you hate him, you are still going to like him..because we have this thing called a heart that actually is still mending ...yeah sucks right? We wanna move on but we can't. Well, as dumb as this might seem the only way that's gonna make you stop going insane with yourself is if...(ready for this?) you talk to him. Tell him whatever he did to you it hurt, and if he's being a real a** about it, SCREAM IN HIS FACE. =P (or something along those lines..)|`|tI0rkxeuaa	All my life everyone told me that hate was just the flip side of love and of cause, being a teenager (at the time) I thought that they were all idiots.    Now that I'm an adult I actually understand what they meant.  Love and hate are connected - strongly.  Usually, the strength with which you loved someone is how much you hate them when things go pear shaped.  The only problem is that because hate is such a strong emotion it can control you just as much as love can.    That is why when you hate someone passionately, you think about them almost as much as when you loved them.  Sometimes even more - weird, I know.  But that's love/hate for you.    The best thing you can do is just try to move on.  Every time you think about this guy force yourself to think about something else, eventually you can train yourself to think about him less and less.    Trust me, it really does work.  Or do what I did, some time ago, every time I thought about this particular person I'd eat something that I really didn't like the taste of.  I know it sounds crazy, but after a while my body started to associate that taste with thoughts of that person and I stopped thinking about them altogether.|`|AA10313295	You go Girlie-friend....

5DJzp6bMaa	Watch Some porn and Use Lube|`|aHjXZEzoaa	first of all, congratulations on waiting!  secondly, congratulations on your upcoming wedding!  thirdly, i really don't think it will hurt you too much...make sure he "prepares" you, relax and enjoy!    GOOD LUCK!!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Lube, lots of foreplay and love.|`|hs793CCxaa	It doesn't have to hurt.     Use lots of lube (KY Jelly or similar) and get him to play lots with you first. Your genitals are designed for sex (among other things) and will relax when stimulated (played with).      Try to relax as much as possible, which will loosen you down there, so you accept him more easily when he enter you.    Relax - it's supposed to be fun. Good luck.    Edit:    If you are really concerned, over the next few days, use your fingers to get yourself used to something going in and out down there - just use lots of lube and don't do it so often that it gets sore from over use. Lay off a couple of days before the Wedding.    Edit again:    Ignore Jojo below - jerk!|`|GvaaTnExaa	gurl woo ....lol that **** is going to hurt and you will not enjoy it at all....its the 1st time soo yah be looking foward to nothing but some pain and a lil light bleeding from when he pop's the cheery ....but on the other hand once you start to do it more often you'll love it =) have fun with it thoe and just let him keep going even if its hurting cause you needa get looser in order to get the good feeling|`|AA11967247	i dont know why people say that "sex hurts the first time", it doesnt.  it may, however, be uncomfortable and hurt if your uptight and that happens to people years into their sexual encounters. your an adult and it would be very likely any hymen breaking has already happened, sports, feminine products and such will do that.  your 23, i would suspect that your well ready to actually have and desire sex, your not going to have a problem.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Just don't think about it. It is such an amazing feeling that once he's in you, every worry will leave your mind.|`|afSqgYBZaa	If you are truly comfortable with him then you should be fine. Just try not to be nervous - that may make it more painful.    It would be best if you were just relaxed, that way you have no muscle tension - being nervous will can cause your muscles to tighten and may make entry more painful. Just know your own body and don't try to rush it, take your time!!    You will be fine, if you really trust him and are really comfortable with him, you will be fine. And don't be frightened if there is a little bleeding, that will be normal for most women!    Good luck and congratulations on the upcoming nuptials!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	LUBE.  Take your time and lots and lots of foreplay.    Are you on birth control?  Congratulations on waiting! That is so beautiful and I admire that so very much.  It does not always hurt either.

Good luck and have lots of fun.|`|AA10413046	Do NOT worry about not knowing what you are doing.  Believe me, he doesn't care about that.  He is marrying you, that means he LOVES you.  If you have any questions ask him about it.  Communicating will make it less awkward, as for the pain well I don't know.
1IM9ys3gaa	wow .__. !  you know what you should do ? just be friends with them, you shouldnt be so mean to them. i mean once i was actually similar to your friends, i used to follow people around and start to be really obsessed with them, but when they told me i changed. there's two things you can do, and please trust me on this:  1. you can either tell them, not on msn or on the phone or something, in PERSON ! tell them that you do like them, except sometimes they act a bit annoying and you dont like it when they follow you ..  2. deal with it ! i mean if they like you so much, you shouldn't be really mean to them or something. Just be friends with them, and maybe they'd get bored of following you around or leave you.  trust me on this, people started telling me how annoying i was, and then i just stopped, and if they wouldnt have told me i would have just stopped following them because i'll get the point, you know .|`|NHD3Hf7Raa	are they really your friends? but, i guess what you should do is get another friend to be with you when your with them. it'll give you someone to balance them. and then you can complain to that friend because they'll understand, and you'll feel better.|`|9NniKJcEaa	Explain to them that they need to leave u alone and they also need to get a life... Tell them that u hate it when people trail after u. if that doesn't work then ignore them, until they get the point. Hope I helped.
hG8uzuMGaa	you should start talking to your friend more often.

Q6akazbZaa	girl, all i can tell u is to get a DNA, but it's sad that u both waited this long, but yes u can still get child support,  but i mean it will more likely go to the child now instead of u, but the best thing to do is to request a DNA in or doing court, to clear up things then he'll have no choice in the matter but to do what he needs to, and that's getting to know his child and paying child support
AVShSjzpaa	Wow this is tough I've been through some very difficult situation in my life as well, I'm 26 and have seen more than most people see in 3 lifetimes, so Id likely be able to help you sort out your feeling if you have msn or yahoo email me at wannasettle26@yahoo.ca and send me your user name and I really believe I can help you sort through this and I can think of lots of advice to give ect, please give me a try I truely know how hurt you are and really want to help show you the light (by that I dont mean god I wont get religious dont worry lol) but seriously I've seen alot and can relate to you.
PRUXtYh5aa	If all you have done is normal sex go to a store, buy some good water based lubricant and anal toys.  Most men like anal.  Just make sure you don't go too big.  Lots of lubricant and take your time.  Make sure you are completely ready before he enters.  Read up on it a bit.  Most women don't enjoy this but that is usually because they can't relax and the guy moves to fast.  Slow.  Unless he is the rare guy who doesn't like this, it will knock his socks off.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Go into the adult shop, and if there is a woman working there, just go up to her and tell her what you just said on here.  She will be very happy to show you some things to get you started.  Have fun!|`|u1uECuFNaa	adamandeve.com    Try vibrators and feathers and the edible powder.   :)|`|5DJzp6bMaa	bondage Gear and a Video Camera|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	there is alot of fun stuff at those shops it is all up to what you are willing to try|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Go to an adult store, and buy a vibrator that appeals to you.  Those stores will have many other things, and depending on your level of curiosity, buy a few and just try them for the fun of it.  If I get more specific or graphic, I'm gonna be toast here.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Get some lingerie and go to the sex shops and see what would appeal to him.  If you've never done things like this before chances are he just probally isn't into freaky things.  So, don't go too overboard.
u7o75zipaa	Well.. you did sound a little jealous, and like you were feeling sorry for yourself.    It's hard to tell what he thought, but it's definately possible he thought that. That's how it came across to me anyway.|`|yo30g3pPaa	He invited you. He either 1. felt bad for leaving you out there or 2. likes you and wants to spend quality time.   INo one can tell you what HE thought.|`|bf1Wsfq0aa	ouch   very trinagly  hmmmmm
oPPjGcJVaa	hi, well if you keep waiting he might as well never do the first move... so well dont do it yourself but.. well idk if this is all guys but personally i like a lot when girls flirt a lot... just show him more attention and seem very interested in him... if you dont get results.. then either be flirtier, or you make thi first move...|`|3Go9k05Zaa	Be comfortable around him, and he will be comfortable around you. Let him break out of his shell on his own. Don't force anything.|`|igkbUflbaa	What is this, the 1850s'. If you like him and you think that he likes you then, yes, make the first move.|`|OsbodPySaa	YES make the first move.  If want it, go get it.|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	why would it be weird? would a girl think it's weird that a guy made the first move? no! so it shouldn't be weird the other way around.    make the first move. it will build up his confidence with you.|`|dFCZCB6Faa	ummm sure|`|iwWN9mUvaa	well if you know he likes you then yes, i always like thje guys to make the first move though even on dates, but guys always want you to so ya...
MDpZFQTJaa	It's never going to work with anybody else until you get over the guy you 'love'. If you can't have him, it's time to move on!  Personally, I believe you can love more than one person.. (I'm in a weird situation right now, and I'm doing just that. There's this guy I loved - I STILL love - but circumstance won't allow me to be with him, so I've accepted that I love him and now I'm dating somebody else.)  Try to accept that you love him but you can't have him, or just act on impulse. (:   You can't make yourself like somebody. I think their needs to be some sort of attraction that's not 'forced'.   Good luck. ;3|`|COmp4sIuaa	You'll be attracted to other guys if you get over the guy you're in love with. It's called a rebound. Get the other guy out of your head.|`|AXJPQgcZaa	this happened to me like 2 months ago!  i tried so hard to like him but i just couldn't  so i told him i think we should see other people and i know that hurt him a lot cause he like me for about a year. but i just could like him he was more a friend then a boyfriend to me!|`|YvZKd1ycaa	i tried that once...i thought i would eventually like him, but it didn't work.  we went out 4 three and a half months, and he was crazy about me but i just didn't like him so i ended it.  but idk, it might work 4 u, but it's ok if it doesn't, you'll find someone someday, and i no ur tired of waiting 4 someday and u want some1 now, but u can't forcefully get the rite guy, u just gotta hope someday you'll find him.  and remember, someday is also any day:)|`|56BbQHXEaa	well thats a stupid thing to do.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Honestly, I think you'd be doing any guy you hook up with right now a huge disservice, because he won't be getting all of you.  If you're not attracted enough to a guy to make you forget about this other guy, that won't change any time soon, and this guy will always be second.  You'll even resent him for not being the other guy.  When you FINALLY get other this guy you're in love with, you'll know, and that's when you'll be ready to move on.|`|okeqhoLPaa	Lovely, wait for him...      He will come if you wait, and if he doesnt, it wasnt meant to be.    But no relationship will ever compare. you will always long for him in your heart.|`|e37915438eb5444cea4bd13f32d5cf79aa	Lot's of people do.  Dating to some people is a way of passing the time. Once you get to know these guys you may just find you like them after all.|`|h3daojzsaa	I tried this a few years ago, I tend to be a rather shy, and unconfident person and I thought maybe I should take this rare shot at a girlfriend. It ended up being a terrible experience, and I really regret it the girl ended up freaking out and basically stalking me for a year.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	you shouldnt make yourself like anyone. it is like being married to someone your parents arranged for you when you were like 4. it wont end up the way you want it to. i think you should start dating, but dont really get involved with people that you are not attracted to just because you are tired of being lonely. i dont know about you, but i would hate to have to play that roll for the rest of my life. you want companionship, and showing someone that you are attracted to them when you are not, is not the way to persue it. it wont give you what you want. so, i think you should start dating, do one of those online things where you get to know them then you meet and talk for a while. or have your friends or you can, set up a date for yourself. but dont get involved with someone if you are not attracted to everything about them. or at least attracted to the important things
zxQT3Uo5aa	You will appear over anxious-not good.  She didn't give you the number to blow it up!  Her response is the greatest indication of how to play this so, wait.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	LOL, you are not pathetic, relax. LOL You have a crush, and I'm sure she likes you to. I would keep trying, and even call her just so you can hear her voice. Maybe after a while though I would back off some, and give her some space. Maybe she's in shock that you like her. Don't worry, I'm sure it's all good. Good luck. :)|`|EdidZdtlaa	lolz text her and be like how come i never see you in school or something like that.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Ha hit her.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	why don't you text her saying hey i didn't see you today what classes do you have maybe i can meet you during passing period sometime then it can come regular.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Stalk her until she realizes she's being stalked. :o    Then tell her she's beautiful.  :]|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	hit her|`|bf1Wsfq0aa	do both  txt n then look|`|OpOm35gJaa	ask her where her locker is. So you can make it apart of your route to class.|`|O64njs0eaa	You're not pathetic, just give it time. She might be nervous to text you too soo you never know and if you get the vibe she's not that into you, then move on to someone else. 'There's plenty of fish in the sea'|`|L44LBa2Xaa	....  If you both attend the same school, why can't you just simply text her asking if her if she wants to met you somewhere before next class starts, or at the end of the school day near her/your locker, or you can ask her to see her in the morning if your both too busy during the day.    Don't try looking for her, that's so much work.  Esp the fact that you have her number, can text and you are in the same school...!|`|TM09z7teaa	try and find her to see if she still feels the same way about you.  and try texting her. But just once. if she doesnt reply, dont keep on going. you'll seem like a freak.|`|ssT6J7ifaa	i would wait to see if you see her tomorrow or you might just text her and be like "i didnt see you at school are you ok?"|`|bCYYYcgHaa	ummm well just txt her saying were where you but dont like get all over her, she mite just want to take a break or something, idkkk  okayy well hoped i help:)|`|ojtqdScPaa	Text her. Ask her if she wants to get some coffee with you. Chicks love cafes!
AA10030524	A good mother would not allow her son to give up everything for her...but some wives would ask it of their husband.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Your mom will always love you no matter what.  divorce happens all the time  you have to defend your wife   you have to defend your mom.  so you are caught in the middle.  So love your mom and love your wife and dont' allow them to pit you against the other one.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	You should NEVER turn your back on your mother but once you take a wife she should come before all others and you should forsake her for no one.|`|4j7qchZyaa	ur mother obviously  whoever says there wife is an asshole and needs to be shot  cause like its ur MA for Christ sake|`|COmp4sIuaa	I would never be able to answer that. Two different kinds of love.|`|HBM1qu0Saa	Of course you love both! Helping someone does not mean you have to choose to love them or not.    You gave a sacred vow to take care of your wife. That is your duty and your legal obligation|`|AA10436595	Love is the one thing that the more love you give, the more you have.  No man should have to make an "either-or" decision and no woman worth her salt would ever expect him to.|`|185855d94f08cdc1a05e5ff48efc7a27aa	i would give more up to my wife cause i love her my mom has been nothing but a drama queen and i was raised by my step mom|`|YdjX5fOWaa	Your wife.  Emerson said, "There is no family as important as the one you will have."  I completely agree with that.  This is a person who has volunteered to spend their life with you without obligation, who will have your children and be with you no matter what. Not that your mother's love isn't strong and wonderful, but your mother isn't going to be your life partner.|`|AA11387335	Why do you have to give up? explain?
DjircW6waa	Are you serious?  He's a player.  Stay with him if you want, but I guarantee this will happen again and again and again.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Didn't read it, but from the title I will give you this advice: If you think he is cheating, then he probably is. Trust your instincts.|`|bZud91iuaa	Look, if the guy can't give you his full attention then he doesn't want the type of relationship you're after.  He's hedging his bets and lining things up on the side in case you two have trouble.  It's Called CYA, cover your A--.  In this case listen to your friends.  That saying about you can't see the forest for the trees?  In other words you don't want to see what everyone else does.  And if you've been seeing each other for about a year and you had trouble starting 8 months ago then you really have only had a relationship for 4 months.  Be an adult and dump the guy.  There are a lot of fish in the sea and you don't need this shark.|`|dgoZCrt0aa	Break up with him. He dosen't love you trust me. Love don't work that way. You prabably love him a lot but what's the point he dosen't make you happy like you want to. If he really loved you he wouldn't be talking to other girls. He's not worth it.|`|5gFjfCGgaa	I think he just wants his cake and to eat it too.  This reminds me of my first love, i wanted it to work out so bad also.  But he doesnt sound very true to you.  He shouldnt even be talking with other girls while he is with you at all.  Thats just flirtation that leads way further with him.  And you both have to want to work it out, not just you. If he truly wants to be with you, then set terms and what you will and will not accept and hope that he will adhere to it.  But it doesnt sound very promising. I would just advise to move on, it hurts, but its better than getting in way more with your feelings and then getting hurt...the sooner the better.
700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	don't worry about it. why should it matter?  don't let it get to you.|`|5YMkieeXaa	NAH. who gives..|`|42N6I9tKaa	same thing....  dont be embarassed|`|X061o2Lzaa	No! If they truly are your family, they won't care. You have clothes, a roof over your head, food, and water. You should be happy and proud you have all that when some people don't.|`|Cix6mHOaaa	I don't think you have to be embarrassed about that. If they start bragging, kindly ask them to stop. If they keep doing that, walk away. YOU HAVE CONTROL TOO! Don't be afraid.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Why on earth would you be embarrassed about that?|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	You call that a problem?

IdlaZQ8Jaa	well... You haven't broken the camera, nagged your parents about their LifeStyle or deleted any of their photos. So if it is about that I would admit to using the camera. and deny viewing anything that would be inappropriate.    when she talks to you about it affirm and reaffirm that your goal is to take your pictures, upload, them and delete them as soon as possible because you are afraid of them(your parents) accidentally coming home and catching you using the camera, so you don't go through any of the files other than your own.    EDIT: she hasn't told you anything about what she wants to talk to you about so keep an open mind and play stupid until she makes a dirrect accusation.|`|4KOuL7mZaa	ok so either your mom wants to talk to you about the camera or the condoms........  ok first about the camera, i dont think that she should yell at you about the camera cuz it sounds to me that you were using it 4 a good cause. but about the condoms. why do you have them? your mom probably just wants to know whats going on with you? cuz my friends asked this one girl the same thing. i wouldnt worry about it.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	Best rule of thumb when cornered, don't lie.  Just own it and be honest.  If she asks if you used the camera, say you did and explain what you used it for.  If she asks about the condoms, be honest.  You'll feel better in the long run for it.  Look, parent's get mad, they also get over it.  There's no reason to walk on egg shells forever over something so silly as using their camera and them having private pictures on it or you practicing safe sex.  We're all human, right?|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Be honest with whatever it is. Breaking a trust is bad enough so dont add to it. Youre 18 and old enough to work and buy your own camera. Violating someone else's privacy is not good. I doubt you'd like someone invading yours. Even if they didnt find out youre using it you should stop and go buy your own.  If you are honest with her and sorry you have no reason to feel nervous. Only if you lie should you feel nervous.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Sweetheart, you're busted!    You will not convince her that the condoms are for making interesting water balloons.  I suspect she is much more concerned about them than the camera and what you have been doing with it.    Additionally, no one will believe you were using the camera for "school projects".  Are you unaware of the fact that sending expllicit pictures over the internet is a serious offense?  You can be arrested for that and at 18 you could be incarcerated..    You don't want to know what discipline I would use if I were your Mom.    Suffice to say you would not be able to take photographs of anything and  the computer would be unavailable to you.    You are expected to  have attained some maturity by age 18.  It seems you have not.        For your own well-being, you should not indulge in  activities that are socially unacceptable and possibly illegal.    About your Mom and Step Dad:  As long as you live in her/their home, you must adhere to their rules.  They have a right and a duty to protect you - even from yourself.  Remember:  A FAMILY IS NOT A DEMOCRACY !!!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well if that's what it's about, just explain to them that yes, you've been going behind their backs and using it...FOR SCHOOL. Tell them that you do NOT want to see any weird pictures that they take and you don't get the camera to look at them! Apologize to them for going behind their backs but explain to them calmly - no yelling or getting frustrated, if you can help that - that you need access to a digital camera for your school stuff sometimes and that if they'd get you your own camera or at least your own memory card, they wouldn't have to worry about you seeing their private stuff.     I don't know what the big deal about the camera is, myself...Digital cameras have memory cards that are easily removed and changed, and the cards aren't that expensive. You can get them wicked cheap on Ebay. If they don't want you seeing their nude photos they should take out the damn memory card and let you use your own in the camera.    ETA: About the condoms...you can just tell your Mom that you really dont like talking to her about this stuff, but that you just keep them so you're prepared if and when something requiring one happens. Tell her that you don't want to catch anything or get a girl pregnant. Hopefully she'll be glad that you're being careful...
CA9OFT4Waa	i think it will just give you two one more thing that you two can relate to each other about, if you ask me, its a good thing that he shared that with you because now you have someone to relate to about something very personal. Enjoy it, its rare that you find someone that can relate in ways that most people cant, and i look up to you guys for not rushing into a relationship. Good luck with everything!|`|hAz30eGVaa	Trust your gut on this one.    If you feel a pull towards him, but think its just not right, leave it as friends. Sometimes friends is better than having a messed up relationship.    Not saying it will be messed up, but it sounds like you both already have a lot of baggage. No point in throwing a relationship ontop of that.    But only you know whats best for you.  Good luck|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	You cannot base a relationship over the fact that both your siblings tried to kill you!    I don`t follow your reasoning  - what has that got to do with the price of bread?    Many successful  relationships don`t even have a lot in common  - sometimes `opposites attract`.   You either like each other and get along, or you don`t.  I think you are analysing too much.|`|k1CdyMH8aa	I think it is always a good thing to know where a person is coming from when they have a problem but I don't know if your situation is something to base a relationship on.  If the two of you enjoy spending time together and you both try to make a relationship work then you will be fine.  Just remember that there is more to a relationship than just having things in common.|`|louKDMngaa	if anything, i see this making ur current relationship, even stronger! one, you both have shared similar situations and he knows he can come to you if he ever needs it AND you'll be able to go to him if you ever need anything. having such similar lives will give you more of an advantage because most other girls wont know how to deal with it and for you to have been there, you will..it wont ruin your furture relationship because he knows he can trust you enough to tell you anything and he also knows that you wont judge him..|`|wqobLdhuaa	As long as you are safe now .

Understand that older siblings are nothing to do with your personal relationships unless you are underage and living dangerously.  Don't worry too much, hm?  Chin up!|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I recommend that you both quit pissing off your crazy siblings so they won't want to kill you...
Q6akazbZaa	girl don't worry about what other people have to say, i mean if it aint one thing it'll be another, your not going to get through life without anyone saying at lest on bad thing about u, me personally i would just ignore it or make fun of it, like when you both are together and someone is saying things, just grab him and kiss him, or something like that, or mock them like, man its just too many haters in this world and brush it right off, but if u let them get to u its gonna make them enjoy it, don't let them see u being brought down by what they have to say, let them see u with the, oh please, and who cares/ what ever hater attitude, they will be pissed and leave it alone, but people r always gonna have something to say, all u can do is ignore it and brush it off|`|AA10620879	Unfortunately it is not only society but the community you probably live in. Different parts of the country are prone to more bias than other parts. There will always be people of different races to cause problems because they are afraid of change or the unknown or do not like races to mix. I lived in Hawaii and my son may have white in him but he pulls more to his dad side with Hawaiian and Filipino. When I moved back to the mainland than I started getting the comments and remarks. My son took it with a gain of salt. You have to learn to overlook the ignorance of others. At least try to have pity on them as they have no clue what they are missing out of in not knowing you and your boy friend personally. Life is too short to live the way others think we should live. Remember there are people out there that would rather stay in darkness all their lives than go out into the light because it is unkown or it would mean changing.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	People hate for many reasons and they win if you become emotionally distraught or angry. You can turn the negative into a positive with the outlook that you are so important to their little worlds that they must make comments....these are the same people who relish the "gossip" sheets on the stars, so you are in good company when it comes to hearing stupid rhetoric by shallow thinkers.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	The things they say, says more about THEM than it does about you.  The are bigoted and mean sprited ugly little people.  Just live your life.  Mike is proof that there are good kind and loving people out there and those are the kind of people you want to surround your self with.   Prejudice and ugliness is part of what you will come up against when you are in an interracial relationship.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	Im sorry for all the hurtful comments I had the same thing happen to me but Im white and my husband is native but everyone thinks he is african american It use to bother me to when women would say white women always taking all the good "black" guys but then I realized that our love for each other was strong enough that i didnt even care about what they had to say anymore even my mothers boyfriend was a racist and I have nothing to do with my mother anymore because you cant help who you fall in love with and as long as your love for each other is strong then you have nothing to worry about there just jealous because you and him look good together and they wish they had that there just have insecurities in them selves. ok good luck and just keep doing what your doing

He's probably just as excited about this as you are.|`|zDeFibxzaa	good going,you kicked him out and broke his heart, instead of getting him help a long time ago.he shouldnt abuse you,but everyone is different.im not blaming anyone.but only you know what you need,if you have took all you can stand and just never could work it out,then its for the best to get it over with and move on,sure it hurts,you will always feel something for ones you care for.but you need to figure out the big picture and stick to what your gut tells you|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Nothing like creating drama, is there? Hey, you got what you wanted, now you will have to live with it. Sorry.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I will give you my prayers. When you think of the good things, remember the bad. Remember that the emotional abuse is probably WHY you are starting to regret your decision. And most of all, remember your kids... :(|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Separate for now.  Hopefully, he'll get help.  I have a hunch that he has something else besides ADHD here.  He should get checked for an anxiety disorder as well.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Don't allow guilt to get the better of you.  If the relationship hasn't worked so far, it may not ever work.    You could put your relationship on "hiatus" and ask him to seek counseling and perhaps medication.  Just be clear to him that if he doesn't do something about his disorder, you can't be with him.    Good luck.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	You two are both so young and immature to have married.  Tell him he needs to go to therapy to control his anger and then you both need marriage counseling.  Also, ADHD has nothing to do with anger.  My husband has ADHD and he has no anger problems what so ever.  We actually fight because he never gets mad at anything.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	I think this is good. You are not getting a divorce, you are separating. This gives both sides the opportunity to find themselves and see if they really want to get back together. You need to see what happens and if he is still a jerk during the separation, well then you made a wise choice.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	Good luck..  this what you wanted now it wil not be easy..  but you will pull through be stronge..  i know you will have a brighter future without him..  abuse of any kind is not good specialy for the kids....
511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	You need to try Hi, get that out, and the other words will form. I promise, but you have to get over the initial fright.|`|hb1H5XAyaa	go up to her, say "hey, my name is _________ whats up?"|`|pLCLtbtFaa	I feel that way with a guy at my school.. shhh.  It's so annoying! I can't ever talk to him because I don't even like making eye contact with him when I do talk to him (which is only when he starts talking to me). Sometimes I wish I didn't like him so that I could actually communicate with him easily. I feel the same way you do- you're not alone. :[|`|cTo5zrF7aa	just go up to her and be like "hey, i'm ____ whats up?"  trust me, i know it sounds way to generic and dumb, but it honestly is the best way to go.|`|T4wiqMRWaa	Hey, you're both 13 so find some common interests e.g. video games, e.t.c dont just talk about football e.t.c. wait a little you're only 13! take ur time!|`|AA12186207	Gosh I wish I was 13 again. Look go up to her and talk about church stuff. Great ice breaker.    Or throw a pick up line at her.    haha|`|Wbo0PEZaaa	tell her:  you: "*****, what that smell like"  her: "hey baby wana come **** me silly in the confession booth?"  you: "damn right *****, you know it"    dont worry it works for me every time|`|EdidZdtlaa	then get to meet her. make the first move. just go up to her and say hi.|`|ldbS2ddFaa	Compliment her, smile, and keep it simple and sweet.|`|ioBUzPVraa	aww youre so cute!!|`|UVncUmpNaa	Juss face your jitters lol. and go ask her for her  .|`|pRo4YyoZaa	well go meet her. every time she looks at you just look at her and smile and maybe wave. she probably like you.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Start simple.  Introduce yourself. More than likely she'll introduce herself .........you can ask her what school she goes too, what kind of things does she like to do........go to movies, hang out at the mall, ect.  Just be yourself and let the conversation go naturally.|`|g8bgfY0Aaa	Start by saying hi. The words will probably flow from there. If your mind goes blank, compliment her. It works (:    Help muchh?  http://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/in...|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	say either hi or hey to start then maybe you should add on a how are you doing? or whats up?|`|I2gat01haa	you should just talk to her.  shes obviously staring at you for a reason|`|VM9KZ0CVaa	Try complimenting her, calling her "dear" at the end of a sentence, asking her how she likes the weather (or something similar), etc.|`|neK9cdemaa	uhhhhh just talk to her? be yourself and she will prolly like you! kay kay hope i helped.|`|oA6UOlKdaa	come on you need to go after her because you are a boy|`|XXf4JHd5aa	Go casual. Just talk to her about movies and things, but don't go boring. You can flirt a bit-but not too much-don't want to freak her out! Just be yourself and I'm sure she'll like you!|`|ARBdyEwlaa	Awhh :] how cute!  Just relax and smile at her. She might even come up to you! But if she doesn't, just say "Hey, I've never met you before. I know almost everyone in the church except for you, so I thought I'd say hi." and the conversation will flow after that. Good luck!|`|49RABlM4aa	Simply say "Hey." If she doesn't say anything back, it's probably because she was startled. Don't give up if she ignores you. Odds are she'll reply, though. You guys have something in common by going to the same church, and I'll bet you could start a conversation with her about school. Who knows? After a week or so you may end up going home with her email address or cell phone number. Best of luck!|`|rUEvI0VPaa	you should try smiling at her, if she smiles back then next time you're close enough to talk, say hi and introduce yourself. ask how she liked the service or what school she goes to or if she is a member of the church. do you have a youth group at your church? maybe you could meet her through that. if she's looking at you she's probably interested. girls are shy, so go for it!|`|uGVUMXS4aa	lol are u sure shes not just looking at u in a weird way?? jkjk im sure ur cute! .. and um just try smiling at her and shell hopefuly start the convo... uuu or like when u have to do the hand shake say hey nice seeing u again! ull knw if shes interested|`|n17Wm6Vtaa	Just go up to her and say hi my name is (say your name lol) and just ask her some general questions to start conversation and to get to know her a little ask her how long shes been going to your church where she goes to school what her interests are hobbies, find out things she likes to do and im sure she'll ask you the same so maybe once you get to know her a little more then maybe you can ask her if she wants to hang out sometime, hope this helped, dont be nervous cause girls get nervous too. good luck|`|LBWLhIRgaa	you should walk by her and dro something, then pretend u dont know where it went, and if she likes yoou maybe she will pick it up for u  then say thankks, and be like: ive seen u arround what school u go to?  and hopefully things will flowww:P  good luck!|`|MXuqo5vUaa	find a mutual friend and get introduced or just introduce yourself. if she is in the youth group join it and make yourself known to her as a friend at first. stay friends for awhile then ask her out to the movies.|`|UhtKYwhuaa	Go up to her like you're gonna say something,then start stuttering really bad, whether on purpose or not. Hopefully she's into you and will think it's cute, then she'll start the conversation.     ps: what are you doing tryin to hook up in church? sinful whippersnapper...|`|PBDXgNBgaa	church..oooooo..yea. idk about that. me personally i wouldn;t date a girl that goes to my church. b/c if we have a fight or break up then what. we have to see each other that sunday. if you like her then i'd keep ot as close friends go to the mall and shii like that but i wouldnt date her|`|Uxdiv3fdaa	You are an idiot. How about you walk up to her and introduce yourself to her.  Hi my name is "whatever your name is"  Then you must tell her immediately that you like her and you stare at her. This makes girls instantly fall in love with you. She probably likes you too.    Learn french, the language of romantics. Show up at her house with 57 white roses and 1 red rose and tell her she is the red rose amongst many whites. This will take no bravery. Also tell her red is your favorite color, and it is an erotic color. This will make her blush to match the rose. Point this out.  To kiss her see wikihow "how to kiss"    It will fulfill you and you can stop looking at Pamela Anderson online.|`|hhrMwnMAaa	Just go over and introduce yourself! everytime you get nervous just breathe inhale and exhale! Tell yourself that you can do it because you can!   Best Wishes|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Well, with church it makes things more difficult because you have to watch aht you say I think that you could try doing the classic "walk by and bump into her and say im sorry" then start a converstion like so I am...., whats your name....and go from there!  Good Luck!|`|qrHUoUVQaa	Just start it off by saying Hi then next time you see her you can ask her if she had a good time at church then what school does she go to, her name and take it off from there.  good luck!|`|1K3Lqnclaa	Well, Maybe You can just go up to her and say hi and talk to her about some things that you like and if she doesn't say anything back then you should just talk about the church or something like that. =]      Good Luck! =]|`|ORaAPCrsaa	be friends at her. and when you think that she has a crush on you, or something that he likes you. then go for it.|`|AA10655022	just goto her and say you know my life is incomplete without u and i cant stand it.i love you and i wanna spend rest of my life with u|`|uff3kOoFaa	introduce yourself, first of all. second, start a conversation about like her interests or something. whether or not she likes sports, if so, what kind? what is she interested in? what does she do for fun? try to learn things about her from her. show her you are interested. talk to her like you would talk to any other person. :)|`|VZPtCkweaa	plan out something you want to say to her. start with something simple: how about. . . HI! don't scare her though, that would be a problem. and smile! but not a scary smile. once you see how it is to talk to her, you'll be able to say more to her.    GOOD LUCK!|`|pK5az6aKaa	just have some fun : smile slowly walk up to her and say..." hi my name is ____________" And shake her hand. the conversation will go smoothly if you just stay calm and keep her interested. If you dont go up to her and make a move then she''ll think your not interested and move on. Smile....:)|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I talk to girls a lot and I would have to say first of all just looking at them a bit helps a lot. Then you can go over and slowly make conversation. For example: "Hey. What's your name? I've seen you around many times before, but have never asked. My name is (your name here)." This usually works pretty well... I hope it helped...  Please tell me how it worked out!!!
CA9OFT4Waa	It could be because she might not of told her friends about you and if some random guy walks up to her lunch table and says hi her friends are going to ask questions and she might become embarrassed so i say thats not a very good idea.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	If you do it with confidence...no...if you look really nervous while doing it and sound nervous...yes|`|7RQDM1HGaa	not at all  but this guy just casually said hi to me  then he started following me  then he asked my friends if he could hack my computer      it was freaking weird|`|afSqgYBZaa	Maybe don't "walk right up to her", but if you see her in the hall or in the lunch room and you happen to walk by her then say hello. She will take a notice in you eventually, but just be cool about it and don't be pushy!|`|D5NkT1dUaa	no its not at all|`|eHfEh85zaa	with confidence no  best answer  short and simmple and right|`|N9DW9tpPaa	cofience without facts is arrogants so go be arrogant andwomen will love it. confdence which i've always had hasn't gotten me very far. that's why i know most women are small minded about dating. guess what. the nice guy that's insecure and nervous. will do more nice things for you and be a more valuable asset in the future then any arrogant jerk will. but women want you to just basicly be hot when men are shund for chosing the same way.|`|NiG85hAPaa	No that's not creepy. There are much creepier things you can do.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	dont say hi..pull her aside and ask her if she wants to sit alone with you and eat lunch. thats the G thing to do. she sees that you appreciate her "lunch time" and it gives you time to talk|`|ye6IiFr7aa	No not at all. its very nice. if you want to impress her. ask her do you mind if i sit here for a moment? or something like that. she wont be creeped out. ask her about the upcoming dances or something. talk to her privatley pass notes to her during classes (dont get in trouble tho)! just be really cool to her. make her feel special and pretty and nice comment her clothes, hair, etc.|`|HJYe1Oh6aa	OMG!!!  that's soo creepy i can't believe they haven't called security on you or something  weirdo|`|Oj1eYTyBaa	No, it's not really creepy. Actually take it to your advantage because most guys can barely be around the girl they like. But do be warned; if your going to say hi or hey to the girl, do it with confidence. =]|`|8xPWd35maa	That's not creepy.  I mean, it might be a little disturbing for a 5th grader or something, but anyone older than that would probably think it was a nice thing to do.  It shows you aren't embarassed to talk to her around her friends, which is usually a problem with boy/girl relationships/friendships etc.|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	no but don't do it daily and also on your first time just walk by her table and look straight at her and smile and walk away also ( don't try too hard) but make it so that she understands that it was meant for her. then she will feel like it  is her little secret that she can tell anyone or keep it too her self and it will make her so happy she will melt with joy!!|`|zNqYuYjgaa	nah not really its pretty normal  but try to talk to her 1 on 1 and not around people sometimes it goes a long way trust me|`|9120dc418a017a1bdb6aae2ce3dfc8caaa	No, that is not creepy, try it and find out for yourself!|`|xRCbJRGDaa	no, not unless, you start a convo, if you just go and say hi, maybe    get talkin'
NHD3Hf7Raa	give her a few days of space, then talk to her again. if it's the same as before, have other friends secretly talk to her to see what the problem is. if she really doesn't care anymore, then it is what it is.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's not that long.  Ask her if she has something going on with her life.  If she treats you with disrespect and etc, then you should just let it go.  Caring someone is very important for friendship.
2P70M5XLaa	Okay, give this a try:    Since you talk a lot on MSN, one day, when you're having one of those loooooooong conversations, casually ask him if he has a new girlfriend. Then if he says he does, tell him she must be a very lucky girl and that you miss your time together... If he says he doesn't, than say you're a lucky girl because maybe you still have feelings for him, and take it from there :)    Hope this helps!  xoxo|`|HJYe1Oh6aa	there is no way  sorry|`|Y8RrUwktaa	tell him that u are in love with other boy and see his reaction towards it, or tell him some stories of people who have splite and came back again.    i hope thats will help|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	in conversation simply say at the right moment that    you still have feelings for him    this is simple and nicely put without comeing on to strong.|`|h06EoMYiaa	Flash him your titties.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Ask him if he ever misses the way things were and feel the situation out.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	say it when yall are F.U.C.K.I.N.G..lls..thats the best way|`|9SfUqf05aa	Don't come on too strong. That's a turn off and it will weird him off. If you both have text, then text him and say hey whats up every couple of days. Then start talking more...and if you're in school, say hi to him in the hallway. Become his friend again, and if you focus on what you want (HIM!) then you'll get it if you do it right. DONT FORGET TO FLIRT!!!!    If you have any other questions, ask me! I've been through that before...and made it out alive =P    -Sammi 
5DJzp6bMaa	Forgive them or Get a Divorce its Not Rocket Science|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Dump her. She doesn't have it in her to be honest or faithful. Fight for custody of your children. They don't need to think that their mother's behavior is acceptable.  She's a serial cheater and you won't change her. I wish you and your children the best though.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	1. Get a divorce,get custody of the kids and tell her to get out asap.    2. You did not give alot of details about the woman so if she is some billionaire and that you are a lowlife bartender in some bar ( since she is dictate to you like that she got something) then i suggest that u stay around for a while, wire her up,get her on record to admit her deeds and get that for the court and u might end up with couple of millions.    I'm assuming she is "NOBODY" so you can skip number two and in that case look only number 1.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	It is very hard to give your trust to someone who lied on top of lies especially that you did forgave her so it kind of makes her think it'd be easy to hide you things in the future. 5 men is a lot. This ain't a 1 mistake thing but 5? Is everything going alright in your sex life? Maybe it's hard taking care of the 3 children. Does she work or she's a stay at home mom? Am not saying that she's not getting enough attention and am not saying she doesn't get enough caring from you, you gave her more love than a lot of men could give to a cheating spouse.   Try to find the reason behind her cheating, is she doing it just for the thrill of the sex or because she's trying to fill up an emotional empty space?  She doesn't seem to regret a lot from what you said and you don't even share the same ideas of cheating. For her being with a woman isn't cheating. Personally, for me it is cheating too.  She seem to like to experiment in the bedroom, try to spice things up although i know that ti seems unfair that the efforts should come from your side after all that she done. She has to show regret and make efforts to win your trust back. If she doesn't seem to be doing anything and taking you for granted, kids or not, this is adultery and she doesn't realise it. You deserve a happy life with a woman that will be yours at 100%.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Hmmm. Exactly what does she think constitutes cheating?     I share your fears. For me, cheating is a deal-breaker, for all the obvious reasons. Good luck, you sound like a great guy. You deserve better.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	She is never going to stop cheating. Save yourself and your children a lot of future heartache, and tell her to get lost. File for divorce as soon as you can, and try for full custody of the kids.    I am so sorry hun, but she's just no good. And if she loved you, she wouldn't have been out sleeping with a basketball team's worth of men.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	I think more problems are ahead.  She has a PATTERN of cheating, and this is a big deal.  She took the quick, easy way out - she told you what you wanted to hear, not I'm guessing she'll do behind your back what she wants to do.  There is no reason for you assume I'm right, but trust your own heart.  If she is playing games, you'll be able to detect that.  If she loves you and is proud of being faithful to the family, that'll show, too.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Okay. So you married a nymphomaniac.     You will very, very likely come across many more instances of this woman cheating on you. You can try therapy, but she sounds like the type of person who uses sex as a way of affirming her desirability.     You can try therapy, but I'm afraid she'll be out in the field, while you're at home playing sucker.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	I agree with that. You either forgive and resent her as well as not trust her or you get a divorce. What she is doing is wrong. When you say I want to stay, why should you not stay. Sounds like you are the father to these kids while your wife is out getting nailed by who knows who. That is not a good parent.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	She doesn't even sound remorseful. For this to work she needs to, at the very least, be sorry. And you must also be able to entirely put your trust in her again. If you try counseling and that does not work, divorce may be your best option with her. What a woman!|`|encb0jc2aa	cuckold|`|GHd84xipaa	it sounds like if you allow this to continue even with a woman,she's not got to stop at that.have you though about swing?i sounds like that maybe what she wants you to do.other then that i would say it's time to go separate ways and take the kids with you.good luck.|`|3frK2iHaaa	Once a cheater always a cheater,,just get out from there.....)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Thats a pattern of cheating, I would not stay with her, she will do it again.  My husband cheated on me ( he swears it was only once) when I was pregnant with number 3 and although I knew about it the time it happened ( just call it womans intuiton) I didnt confront him until almost a year later. I just wasnt ready to be a single mom of three little kids. We talked about it and I decided at that point to stay with him and move on but I told him also that I will never ever forgive him again and although I would not want to be a single mom I wont be a doormat for him either.   She has no respect for you or your marriage. Either get in good couseling or just walk out. You deserve better|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Get out of the relationship.   FIVE?  OH, MY!  One I can barely understand..five is just sick.   She will seek out more............after a while.|`|HynN4MM1aa	Good advice Cravin!|`|an1EMiFkaa	Im with Cravin on this one...Forgive or move on. It will do neither of you any good to continue on if there is no trust.|`|6tpDvSQPaa	I Love cravins answers direct and to the point lol|`|qYZkeB8maa	Run now.  Your kids will be hurt more by being in this situation.  Its obvious she rather lead an alternative lifestyle than be a faithful wife and hold the family together.  Make sure you are gathering evidence of her cheating for divorce court because things will come out better in your favor.|`|7bf74d32e94d2654d289c709b1b924c8aa	In these times of HIV and Aids prevalency.  She had the nerve to cheat on you.  You sound like a nice guy.  But, at this point, I would suggest professional counseling if you want to save your marriage.  Because, even if she says she won't do it again.  You still have the right to deal with your feelings.  Maybe try your church or seek help with a professional marriage counselor.  Even if she does not want to go, you go.  You deserve better.  You have been betrayed.  And, might I add.  I don't think the cheater deserves to be able to get out of going to counseling if they were the source of the offense.  She acted out, it's her moral responsibility if she wants the marriage.  Good luck!|`|vXubuAqzaa	i agree with cravin|`|jrHVRqvBaa	I  have been cheated on for the last 5 years and I do understand how it feels and am so proud that a guy is the faithful one. There is still hope that not all men are unfaithful.    Try marriage counseling. I was able to get the truth out of my husband as we had to discuss openly with another party involved    Try to find out the reasons why she wanted to cheat on you- was it she was unhappy, wanted more attention, lack self confidence etc. I may cheat if I did not get enough attention from my husband and suspected he was also cheating on me.    Also, if you take her back, give her a consequence. My counselor advised that you must do this or leave room for another mistake as she knows that she will be forgiven.    Lastly, my prayers have assisted me. I can firmly declare that the reason why I was able to get everthing out in the open because I prayed to God to help and reveal the situation. With trust in Him, a series of events unwinded  itself only to reveal what he was doing and how much he has cheated on me. God has  been good to  me but you've got to wait.    Lastly, if you want to build the relationship because there was a breakdown in communication, you need to start there. Talk, talk, talk and openly. Find out what happened thoughout the years that caused this. Spend time with each other.    Good luck and the May the Lord guide you.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Game playing.    Get a divorce. Simple!

Why should he propose when he has everything he wants without actually being committed? I'm not saying he is committed... it's just that when you are engaged and getting married, that's even more committed. What's happening now is probably exactly where he wants it... close enough to being committed, but if he breaks up with you it'll be okay because there's not really a ring involved.|`|bcZSIphUaa	I went through the same thing. My boyfriend told me that he had started paying off my engagement ring over a year ago. He kept telling me that we would be engaged by my birthday (October) last year, then definitely by Christmas last yearbut it kept taking longer than expected. This was because my boyfriend was putting LOTS of effort into my ring. He started paying it off and organised for a jeweller to go to get my diamond from Antwerp (which took months) he then designed it and has been working with the jeweller to get it perfect for months! Not to mention how long it actually takes to pay a ring off (my boyfriend is paying around $10,000!). Now thats a commitment. ITs taken him over a year to pay for it!    Anyway, its nearly ready (yes Im still waiting!). We are going on a holiday in a couple of weeks and I know that he is going to propose whilst we are on this holiday so I havent got long to wait now! I think its cute that your boyfriend has told you that he is paying the ring off. My boyfriend was the same. You just have to be patient! Im so excited and your time will come soon too : )|`|K1xNKSYxaa	Sounds fishy to me.  How far away did you move?  I'd give it six more months and then, perhaps hit the road.|`|fCS6oecCaa	don't force someone into marriage,, it will, happen because you MADE him do it. and it will end up in divorce.|`|gb9ERmHPaa	Give him the night of his life, he is probably having second thoughts.  Go crazy though do things you wouldn't normally do.  At the very end kiss him on the cheek and tell him you love him.  It will make him feel better about being a one-woman kind of guy.|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	Well he told you he is paying on your ring (i'm assuming you hassled him about it), which kind of ruined the surprise anyway of a proposal. So perhaps he is just waiting for the right moment to propose to you how he wants to and still be able to surprise you.     2.5 years is not that long of a time, just be patient.It isn't like you have been waiting for 4+ years or anything.    By harassing him into marrying you it may make him change his mind and not even want to marry you. Many of my husbands friend's gf's did that and now their men aren't even sure if they want to marry these women anymore because of that, same goes with having children. Just relax.|`|QjHqiNZiaa	tELL HIM WHAT'S UP AND THAT YOU WOULD FEEL BETTER KNOWING THAT YOU WILL BE WITH EACH OTHER FOR TH REST OF YOUR LIVES.....sMILE AND TELL HIM THAT YOU LOVE HIM AND YOU NEED ASSURANCE|`|3eI0UFDiaa	its a big step in someones life. dont push it. just wait all things happen in good time. and plus if its not meant to be it wont. you made a big move for him. and if he is serious he will. maybe he is paying for the ring. just hang in there girl.|`|ldbS2ddFaa	No one will be able to answer this for you. Only him.|`|AA10962298	Tell him from now on you are cutting him off until your wedding night. It will force him to make a decision, one way or the other.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	You screwed up when you moved in. He has all the benefits of marriage without the commitment. Why would he bother to marry you?  I suggest that you move out and on. How could you trust him now?|`|afSqgYBZaa	Just be patient, don't force him into proposing. Let him do it on his time, and you don't wanna fix something that ain't broke.|`|mPSTNmPSaa	Well, first of all you told Him when you wanted him to propose, not cool. And if he says he's paying the ring off, let him. You don't know how much the ring is, or how much he pays monthly. Maybe it's a bad *** rock!!! It just seems like your making a lot of demands about the way things should be done, and by when!!!  Chill out, and stop trying to force things to happen. They will, and just because they don't happen in your time, doesn't mean they won't happen. But, if it's that worrisome, then you need to decide if it's worth hanging around for. And if marriage is that important, and he seems unlikely to propose, then move on!! Good Luck!!!|`|AA10436595	You've made some major life changes for him.  What has he done for you?  Why would he want to get married when he's already getting all he wants.  You need to tell him straight up that you are ready to get married.  You understand that he may not want that and that he certainly has the right to feel that way.  However, unless and until he is ready, you are leaving and he is not to contact you any way any time.  Tell him that IF he is ever ready to marry you, he may contact you one time.  If you are still free and if you are still interested in him, you can discuss it then.  Then leave!|`|1yov0JF9aa	why should he, you have not given him a reason to ask.|`|uWJWz068aa	Just no....Im no.... Yes no? FO sure.|`|2YmzqL1baa	I have beem in your situation. You really need to have a serious talk with him and tell him to cut the crap and tell the truth.|`|vKDwaqPraa	i think you should just be patient, he'll pop the question pretty soon. just don't worry about it or it will seem like forever till he asks|`|vdaukbPzaa	You shouldn't be making such commitments until you are at least engaged. if you are having premaritial sex then that could be another reason why he hasn't proposed. he has the balls, he just doesn't have the balls|`|w20XpzpMaa	Why don't you propose to him instead?|`|MuKd0RAUaa	If you love the guy, why does it matter if you're married or not? If you pressure him into marriage, he'll probably resent you for rushing into this lifelong commitment. I say take it slow. Let him do it at his own pace. Good luck.|`|F6jBrNmuaa	You should just start a conversation about rings to reming him.|`|5Xu2eYiFaa	dont concentrate so much on the fact that you arent engaged. be happy and content that he watned you to move with him and that he wants to be engaged.  give him time and itl hapen|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	I'll tell you now, when you give ultimatums, that is not a good sign. I also don't know the two of you so I cannot accurately give advice, but I would never move with someone I wasn't engaged to.    My boyfriend had a job offer and Germany and asked me would I consider moving, and to move out of the country with some guy who in reality I'm just "dating" even though we lived together, I told him no.     I don't feel comfortable making that kind of a commitment if he can't make the other kind.     To be fair, maybe he wants to pay for your ring and then ask you, but I think its a little tacky to tell you that. Wheres the surprise and romance. Sounds a bit like an excuse to keep you quiet. Do not make ultimatums, live your life for you until there is a ring.|`|KFj0RfEUaa	well he res what you do if you have been with you for this long and, if he loves you he will propose but you should start thinking of new options because if he is leading you on your on your wy to Heart ache think about that.|`|fpbRv3Otaa	Why not be completely honest with him, I'm sure he will propose. You're 24, that's plenty young and you have plenty of time for marriage. This relationship will turn into marriage, I'm positive.  Tell him you want to get married, just talk about it, why not be honest? why not be forwarD? You've done enough for him, you deserve to be able to atleast discuss it with him.  Rings take a while to pay, months and months..perhaps he's waiting to buy you a really nice one? He's already said he will, if for some reason something is making him wait..then just talk about it and don't be afraid.  Have some faith, it'll happen.|`|TFpWtEZMaa	Just make plans to move out and after you are all set, tell him that is not right to live together with out being married and then just go, no matter if he proposes.   If he started paying on your ring, he must assume that the two of you are engaged but have him make it plain and clear by having him ask. Also you can talk to his Mom and/or Dad or grandparents about this. I bet your parents or grand parents are not happy that you live with a man that you are not married to.  Is this guy your best friend also? Does he seem to need you? I don't mean need you for income or sex only, but does he need you for companionship also?|`|m13CCGc1aa	What is with the marriage obsession everyone has?  If you have already moved in with him then you are likely not concerned with going to hell because you are living in sin.    If he is paying on your ring, it is only a matter of time before he proposes.      I think it is kind of rude, but you could ask for him to show you the ring or show you the payment stub so that you are for sure that he is really paying on it.    If he's not ready to propose, pushing him toward it is not going to help.  If you push him into getting married before he is ready, he is just going to resent you.  If you are that unhappy where you are living or need more of a commitment then he is willing to give, then all you can do is move on.|`|207dFmdHaa	if you cant talk about marriage and get a commitment, then how can you trust and spend the rest of your life with this guy....move back home, get a job and continue with your life, I said your life, if he really wants to marry you he will come get you...if he is really into you, he wont let you go, don't tell him you are leaving and then he gives you a ring and you are engaged for 5 years, if he gives you the ring pick the date that day....don't let him string you along any longer|`|uui0ZaG5aa	After three months me and my now husband of 16 years (17years dating) knew we wanted to marry.  We announced it at six months and married exactly one year to the day of our first date.  IF YOU KNOW...YOU KNOW!  It is not just a woman thing.  Men know, they are made of flesh and blood and feelings just as we are and they know if this is the girl for me by the third or sixth month.  If after two years you don't know a person well enough to marry them....SOMETHINGS UP---He or She just isn't all that into you, or they WOULD HAVE gooped you up!  They would have made certain that you were theirs and only theirs and going to stay theirs taking no risk.  You already gave your ages and obviously your not facing college or lack of career/job as a hang up or at least lets hope not.  As I said, when you know...you know.  If he has any hang ups and uncertainty about the future...well, you are his future and it would be from some uncertainty in the relationship or with you.  A man doesn't commit to his girlfriend because he hates his boss or co workers or....his car or shoes--one has nothing to do with the other and has nothing to do with his LIVING RELATIONSHIP or lack of them.  It would be the person he is in the relationship with that he would have to have the problem with.  At age 30...men are mentally grown up and established enough to know...what they want or don't want.      In reading other peoples comments they all say don't push, don't push.  Well, that is true, but the fact remains, after two years it should be a none issue and you shouldn't have any uncertainties and have to feel the need to ultimatums.         As I said in the beggining, i have been married sixteen years and now my husband seems hell bent on getting me a nicer and bigger ring, has always wanted me to have a very nice ring, however, he got what he could, because the actual marriage and having me in his home as his WIFE was priority one.  An engagement ring isn't like a wedding dress, where you shouldn't see it until the wedding day.  Ask to go see the thing he is paying for--after all you are getting married and it is your money too!!!  You really should be apart of the 'picking out' process.  It is your finger the ring has to sit on.  So you have your options opened to you and the best thing for you to do now.....is sit down with him, show him that you have asked this question on line and not keep this behind his back.  Own up to this and let this be your starting line into the conversation and asking him...."ARE YOU REALLY ALL THAT INTO ME?  IF NOT...LETS STOP WAISTING EACH OTHERS VALUED TIME AND MONEY'
SXh0FDHzaa	wow there are many reasons y he broke up with u.    1. wen someone hangs up on you and you dont call back they may feel as if u dont care about them.    2. Jeleousy is a powerful thing. Being jeleous is both good and bad..but mostly bad because jeleously bring out the worse in people    3. Cheating is a hugee no no.!  even when you guys are on a "break" that probably hurt him big time    4. Spending time together is also important because if you never get to at least look into the eyes of the one you love, there may b a loss of "spark/flame" between the two of you    5. WOW! he walkd 5 MILES FOR YOU.!   well i can most definitly understand both sides clearly and u were both in a bad situation at the time. it ok. it happens to  many.    6. Maybe since you show all of these signs he may get the feeling like ur not serious about u guys relationship            for future reference:  when u get a new relationship..dont make it anything like the past..make it better.   make an effort to see him once in a while..maybe every weekend. and dont b jeleous. it may b hard at first but the truth is that if you really trust and care about that person you have nothing to b jeleous about. also DONT CHEAT.!  FOR NOTHING.!  NOT EVEN ON A STINKIN BREAK.!  and also if he hangs up..call back.whether its when hes mad or just joking because it a great way to show you care|`|JuRtPdiVaa	Wow...

1YDpRGocaa	Well its very likey she isnt even mad at you but is upset about something else and is taking it out on you. My mom has done this since my parents split when i was 11 and im 16 now. Just take a deep breath and remember it probably has nothing to do with you if you want to talk to her about it wait till she is in a good mood then just be calm and polite and hope she dosen't explode! I warn you this dosent always work but when it does it really helps i hope it works out for you! Me and my ma still have an up and down relationship and im sorry you are going through this i just keep promising myself not to be like her and remember how she made me feel so i will never do that to my kids! hope this helps!!!!|`|C6d4ndMOaa	Probably stressed and taking it out on you.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Ask her the f* is her problem.    You have to stand up for yourself.    Tell her you're treating her like crap and it's not fair.|`|AA10822361	she might have pms (premenstrual syndrome) or may be upset that the house is up for sale  try to stay out of her way for a while|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Sounds like your Mom has some problems she is not dealing with very well and you are the closest person to take out her frustrations on. sorry that you have to be the scape goat dear. just chill out and try to be helpful till she mellows out some.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	I am a Mom and sometimes us Moms get overwhelmed by things and lash out at the ones we love...the most. She sounds stressed about the sale of the house and all.I am NOT defending her, believe me, and when I yell at my kids, afterward, I feel like kicking my self in the rear. Just try to keep things in order and straighten up until the house is sold. Show her you are on her side and understand. Tell you love her, but not to yell at you. Her saying you are not normal, was not a nice thing though and it seems she is looking for things to channel her stress and anger out on, which is wrong, because you are just a kid, but just try to help her by keeping things straightened up until that house is sold. You are all under stress right now...moving is not a fun thing at all for anyone.  Good luck, Sweetie and hang in there. It will get better.|`|x6rHjPIIaa	Sounds like she might be Bi-Polar :( My mom was and she acted the same way.|`|fusIwst4aa	Maybe something is bothering her, and she has no one to take it out on..., don't listen to her|`|2Yj4jTqhaa	What's the question?    It sounds like every other teenage girl~mother relationship. She's going to yell at you a lot, and you're going to shut her out a lot.
2vaGZ4eDaa	I think you get to do whatever you want to.  I mean, if the hyphenated thing is supposed to keep going, when will it end?  There isn't room to fill out a check for all the names a person might need.   Also, there are the kids to ponder, too...a single last name might be easier for them to understand.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	May this be the biggest problem you ever have to work out.|`|K1xNKSYxaa	Whatever you want it to be.  Personally, I'd ask him to change it to where we'd have the same last name but that can't/won't be done in many cases.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	This is why the hyphenated name thing was stupid.     I would just take his father's last name and move on from there. Time to bury this nonsense.     Good Luck!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Do whatever you want. One of my friends is married to a man with a hyphenated name. She kept her own name.|`|IvMPh09baa	Why don't you just be really unique and make the whole name hyphenated... try this:    Kelly-Joe Kristen-Joseph-Jones... that will be your whole name.. just combine all of your  names and be done with it.|`|2pDKXnkZaa	you can use what ever you want honey. you can use you last name as you middle or your middle as your last name. so sure, you can take only part of the name that is fine.
yT3ZNEROaa	Best advice is BE YOURSELF.  You should never change to be something your not.  Its kind of like lying.  Be true to yourself and you will never be boring. As long as your happy who cares what others think.|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	You can't make yourself be random. It seems like every single person thinks they're "crazy" and "random" and "weird", when actually, they're just causing themselves to be even more average.    Just relax and loosen up. You can't change who you are, but you can become a better you. Don't be afraid to speak out or do something silly because you don't know what others will think. Don't worry about others' opinions, don't even think about it. Just put yourself out there. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. (:|`|HikylB4Taa	Normal is not normal, do what makes u feel good! Who cares what other people think!|`|iMGeSGdcaa	just be yourself...you aren't dull or boring...just have more self confidence, try doing something different to boost your self esteem!    :D  smile!        |`|P68rfGiyaa	ok i think you should ignore what people think and just be yourself dont change yourself for anyone. you can try different sports if you want to be more well rouded or join a club but dont change yourself for other.s|`|ts4Dg5TDaa	You shouldn't try to change yourself for your friends or to fit in. Stay the way you are. If you feel as if you only act "normal" cause you are afriad of what people will think just stop caring.

I wouldn't change though. Its kinda like being a designated driver. People look to you for help and guidance even if your not the most fun person in the world. All I have to say is that if five people go to a party and get drunk, there is no one to drive them home and bad things could happen. But that's just my point of view. Hope this helps.|`|Run7dyraaa	What's normal?|`|CnM2U1bXaa	http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com/|`|4r0Cyih5aa	Be yourself, baby. Go crazy honey.

LOVE YOURSELF AND OTHERS AND LAUGH MORE : )|`|2Yj4jTqhaa	I hate the way people think they're different because they're fun and random.    Right now, everyone's "random", so that's the normal. Try pulling that next time someone calls you "normal".    Some people are just more outgoing than others. Try to catch on to conversations, and just say whatever comes to mind. Don't think about it.|`|AA12223669	I don't know what you're like so I don't know how to tell you to be different. Although I can tell you how to be a bit more random.    Every Sunday, get the Sunday newspaper and go to the Calendar section. In the back, there will be listings of local concerts and such and tell your friends you're going to it and that they should come. If you don't have anyone to go with, still go! It's important to start doing things on your own to gain confidence. You'll hear about more random fun things through the grapevine.    If you want to be seen as differently, maybe a little edgier I would suggest a haircut. One that is edgy and a little punked out. Get a pomade from the hair section to help exaggerate your chuckly layers and buy some new make up. Wear more eyeliner and shop at different places. Take someone whom you really admire and model yourself after them. If you like the girl that seems totally confident and independent, try to be more like her. Wear the shoes that you think will give you the personality you want. If you can't afford new clothes, rip up some old ones and try to "invent" a new style for yourself. Find out the hip music that people listen to (not the Jonas Bros) and start listening, memorize the lyrics and try to learn of as many bands as possible. The more you know, the hipper you'll appear.|`|4qhWiL8zaa	If you have to go out of your way to be "cute" and "random", then you're going to be even worse. People will appreciate you a LOT more if you're boring and being yourself, rather than being fun and random and it being a fake act. You're probably not even that boring, or maybe your friends don't know that you are interested in the same things that they are since you don't vocalize your opinions. Try speaking your mind a bit more, but don't go out of your way to be someone that you aren't. A poser is the worst.|`|yql9cGBtaa	its not hard believe me im used to be normal but now im the random dude and i even found out im funny =)    alrite my solution is to step out of your comfort zone and do stuff you usually wouldn't do with confidence. but don't become a rebel and draw a limit. thats all i hav to say!|`|5g0sWGIwaa	Alcohol , as long as you are of  age|`|AA10453556	Try to develop a good sense of humor.

She just sounds mad, and most likely not at you but at your dad's lifestyle before her.  I'd sit down and talk to her and your dad, if he's still around.  Explain to her why it's important for you to have connections with these siblings and find out why it bothers her so much.  You can also consult a family counselor to help you.  Most schools have a counselor that can give you some advice or even sit down with you and your mom.  Don't worry, I know your mom loves you!
oL6roNSUaa	ive walked into the wrong class but didn't even realize it until the pledge of allegiance :)  your not alone|`|PBe2qbXNaa	No....but it is a good laugh....sleep earlier.|`|a6QK1oQFaa	omg yes!  just today i felt so stupid because wanted to stop a bus that wasnt even in service....and i put my hand out thinking he would stop...and all the people in the bus stop thought i was crzy...lol  yeah..human beings make stupid mistakes..and move on :)|`|4qhWiL8zaa	I wouldn't even worry about it. I don't even stand up for the pledge at my school, i just continue playing on my phone or doing whatever. People look at me like i'm insane or a heathen. They don't know where I'm from (a military base, where they NEVER said the pledge) or who I am, so they have no right to judge. Don't worry about what people think. They might mess with you about it for a while, but who cares? They'll forget about it pretty quickly.|`|CC9yXfONaa	yup. Stared at sumones boobs when I was zoning out and thinking about what was for lunch|`|MuKd0RAUaa	Don't worry about it. This kind of things happens to all of us. Have a good laugh about it and move on. No one is going to remember it.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	Just laugh it off. Make a joke out of it. I had something like that. I got mad at this one person and started chasing that person. I fell on the ground and a lot of people saw. I laughed with them and the person I was chasing helped me up. I just started talking talking to him. We laughed at my mistake.=)|`|fYRrVgxfaa	no|`|8qfo3FvYaa	I do stupid stuff like that all the time.  LOL  Once i fell into a hue mud puddle at school and had to go the rest of the day covered in mud.  I ripped my pants in gym once and that was one of the worst days in my life.  I went into the wrong liturature class and stayed for the entire time and everyone was wondering why i was there.  Im the middle of class i started laughing really loud at something that happened the day before.
GmghrL4Iaa	i suggest you talk to your grandfather first and make sure he even said those things in the first place.   you can never really trust anyone , who knows maybe your friend Steph was lying..    if it turns out that he did say that, ask friends if you could stay over their house until you find an apartment suitable for yourself.
yT3ZNEROaa	You go girl.  Be full of yourself-Go for it! Sounds like people are trying to bring you back down to wearing black cover up clothes.  Be true to yourself, and as long as your not putting others down to make up for the last couple years your perfectly fine.|`|lbVrTc1Xaa	Its ok, and people are just hating. You deserve it. Enjoy it while you can because theres always miserable days ahead in life.|`|4pJ4y0GCaa	great  change|`|P68rfGiyaa	ok i have this problem with people saying im spoilt you sould say "if you think im full of it ok but im just gonna keep being who i am and if you dont like that im sorry" if there really your friend they will accept you. you can also make a joke out of it like "im full of bologna" or something like that and you can tone it down a little around them.|`|5e6f827c10807a358ec8c468a0da0047aa	i think u should enjoy life while ur at it. dont worry what ur friends say well maybe u are but your trying to enjoy life.
CA9OFT4Waa	i would stop texting him because after awhile it will look like your obsessed with him, just talk to him in person and ask to hang out, become his friend and then see if there is anything there. maybe he hasnt really come out to anyone yet and its new for him, you dont know. so just give him time, and maybe you will have to be the one that makes all the first moves but if he likes you things will turn around, but it takes time, so dont rush anything.|`|qZcd1OjNaa	Get closer to him, dont txt him. he might end up txting you and missing you. dont screw it up like i did, i told the girl i like thru txt on accident, ruined my chance and friendship.|`|j45q4B6Eaa	hes probably not gay? and he knows you are so hes avoiding you? i know when i dont reply to a text im avoiding/ignoring them|`|iaiNBkqGaa	well i may be straight and a girl but maybe just look for aigns drop just tiny hints if hes not gay or if hes jus not interested move on. don be freaked ther will be more out there.|`|fAlFgx6Zaa	I'd stop texting him.  A lot of people text me through text,   and get to know me that way,  but they're too intimidated to talk to me in the real world.  they even ask me out through text!  you should start talking to him,   and becoming friends with him first.  hang out, chill, whatever.  then, after he gets to know you, he can make his decision.  good luck (: !
DNX9Wproaa	I've come to a conclusion. I think that it is that you may be too independent for a guy. You know how guys like to be the hero and want to everything for their girl, like Josh does for me most of the time. Also they may see you intimidating and maybe even too mature for them, that is why some people may to refer to you as a *****. I love you dearly, and you know you are not ugly, you are beautiful. You just either need to step out to a guy, or just wait for a guy to come. It'll happen eventually, most likely when you don't expect it. Besides you and me both know that there is so much issues you are dealing with for you to handle a boy right now. And also, you don't need a boy you need a man. Trust me, one day, you'll get him, and everything will be perfect. You'll run off and live a happy ever after.    |`|O61k4AUmaa	i'm with you sugarz|`|g8bgfY0Aaa	I don't have a boyfriend either.. but 7 guys like me. It's horrible.

I have the same problem sadly..  *huge sigh*  I think you are pretty cute the guys in high school go for..easy girls(slutty) so don't worry about it ok?  I don't have a boyfriend right now ethier...  but I wouldn't want to get with some loser guy who only want one thing.  have some good morals and respect(for your self deviantly important!) and you'll find the right guy!|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	yeah; i think ur gorgeous i guesse you have to wait and take risk ask out a guy you like i'm pretty sure they will say yess (:|`|oPPjGcJVaa	ok you are not ugly..   idk.. well maybe just you need to flirt more or something.. i like it when girls are flirty, i pay them more attention than normal.. and might have something with tghem..|`|STSsThW7aa	You're very pretty! And have amazing eyes! (:    This is an oldie forward I got in a text, it really said something to me.  ....here it is....  Girls are like apples.   The best ones are at the very top of the tree.  The boys are too lazy to climb up and take them.  They are also afraid to fall and get hurt.  So they settle for the rotten ones on the ground that are easy.  The best apples feel upset.  When really they are amazing.  You just have to wait for the brave enough boy to come along.  He will be the right one (:    I loved that, sorry if it's corny. But I think it's true in a way [:|`|UhtKYwhuaa	No Homo: You aren't ugly you're actually very cute!  its probably because you, to me, look too innocent to handle. Slut it up a bit, i don't know, put on some heels and a miniskirt and walk to the grocery store, do something crazy and outrageous.|`|HGtX5iQgaa	your fine. dont fish for compliments and stop being insecure. just put yourself in more positions to meet guys and dont be a slut, but dont be shy :)|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	talk to me. im 17    http://www.myspace.com/wut_it_do_357|`|KBPyP13Iaa	maybe if someone likes you there just afraid to ask|`|jzdUA2Xkaa	I've found that a lot of girls overlook many guys that could be great companions. It's happened to be that sometimes i see a girl and think 'god she is beautiful' but she doesn't really pay attention to me or anyone else for that matter. I'm not saying pick any guy up, but do give guys a chance to approach you and show interest in them, many great guys lack confidence not love.|`|o2J1RbnVaa	you are not ugly) but anyways even ugly ppl have bf's and gf's) Just be a cool girl, be yourself! Be funny and lovely)|`|KRDF9A6Uaa	WOW even I would ask u out that is strange no boyfriend and u look like that. Damn u got real nice eyes to u should talk to guys more and once u found some1 u like hang out with that person more and when u feel the time is rite which u will ask that person out. Don't wrry just keep lookin theres some1 out there 4 everyone|`|SnYyUMJ2aa	I think it's the guys problem, not you! They could be intimidated of you, because you're probably really smart and can think for yourself.  Guys like to be the knight in shinning armor for girls, and when a girl seems to be fine on her own, then they don't bother.   Or you could come on too strong.  Either way, you're not the only girl that is having this issue! (me as well!)  So just put yourself out there and make friends. Who knows? Maybe your next best guy friend will be your next best boy friend!|`|N2BAdOXEaa	There is nothing wrong with your looks, you are one that would make a mon look twice, but you need a great personality to get a guy interested or be more out going for one to pursue you.    It wouldn't hurt for you to make the first move on a guy. Good luck with your choices.|`|ORaAPCrsaa	you're not ugly. maybe "mr. right" is not around. you just have to wait him. :)|`|3YpVVRWpaa	WOW.Look at you.  you are pretty and you eyes OMG.  im surprises why you doent have any but when grils are cute and pretty as you are we guys think the girls are out of there leuge and also they think that you already have a BF they tend to back off.  best thing is to act single.tell you GFs to tell tthere BFs about you situation.    but i wouldnt be worried its just a mattre of time you be swept of your feet by your dream guy.
sp80uzmLaa	Maybe she is shy IDK ask her
HynN4MM1aa	I think Billy Bob is more your type.|`|iehpDiZ8aa	Its not fair to have someone pick for you. You need to decide which one you would rather be with and which one makes you happy|`|zKUUWqeTaa	you really shouldnt judge people for their names...  that's just low on soooo many levels.    You need to know about their personality, to see if their really a good person.  not by their names....      : ]|`|KWl605JTaa	wow how shallow picking a guy by his name?  or even asking other people to choose for you    they deserve better than you.|`|IM9bk1YMaa	You need to explaiiiin!!    Like, you need to say what you see in the guys and how they act.    No one can give you an answer otherwise. =]    xx|`|bSHhWXfPaa	WTH? why choose the guy you liek by names.. i THINK thats stupidd. you should follow what your heart want and not by other opinions on names. if u can choose then break it down. who do you think will be best wit you? who would do this who would do that? who has the personality that you like best? ask questions to yourself. follow you heart |`|anaaY9DRaa	nah. Billy Bob doesn't quite cut it. what about Who The Crap Are These People? he's nice.|`|uTni4vOQaa	Nice simple John    Or.......  try all of them x
yT3ZNEROaa	Well she probably collects things for examples frogs or angels.  So I would get her one of those for her b-day.  Valentines day is a day for lovers so you really don't have to get her anything.  You could do a card, or a card and candy.  I'm not sure if your intentions are to be more than just close friends.|`|3AAtPzSaaa	well you guys arent  going out so i dont think that an actual present for valentines day is necessary.. unless your looking for more then just friendship.. if she doesnt have a boyfriend maybe go get somthing to eat for dinner or lunch other wise leave her with her bf for valentines.   for her birthday that really depends on how much you want to spend. high price range of about A$200 would recommend a tiffany and co. necelace/ bracelet. theres a beautiful long chain with a small hart on it saying plz return to tif. and co. (or somthing similar) and the braalet has the sam but thicker chain.... (u can get circles rather then hearts as well for either)  lower price range would be some cds of her fav. artists, fav movie dvds, book, perfume (the new gucci envy 2 is awsome!!)  i find clothes a little hard because of taste/size.  a ticket to an upcoming concert shed  like, if shes into sports maybe a sports game (soccer)....  theres so much really.....|`|euwI5KiHaa	Get her a funny card or something  Or give her candy (but not romantic candy like chocolate)  candy like skittles or something|`|CFU77qCbaa	Get her earrings or if she doesn't have her ears pierced, give her a bracelet or something for her birthday. And for her Valentine Day gift, write a note and give her a box of candy (small pack.) And give her a make-up set lol. Good luck!|`|x8c4pbJWaa	Okay, since she is your FRIEND, you'll want to stick with non-romantic type gifts. The best gifts for this situation are Albums, DVD's & Books, Gift Certificates & Girl Stuff (Like lotion gift-sets from Bath & Body Works or Victoria's Secret). Heart-shaped candy still works as long as there's no "BE MINE" type print on it.     And, same goes for her birthday. Plus, flowers CAN be given for a birthday... my friend always gets me wild flowers - since roses are considered romantic, you'll want to stick to wildflowers or orchids, basically anything but roses.. She'll be happy with anything.
wl85WhsTaa	well if he's not taking your hints that you don't feel the same way he feels for you then you just gotta verbally say it. Hey (whatever guys name is), I'm sorry but I don't like you the same way you like me, I still wanna be friends if you do but I'm just not wanting a boyfriend right now.......I tried to be blunt and soft at the same time :)|`|BNBKVpz2aa	Tell him "I appreciate you're kindness, youre a nice kid but I only like you as a friend" Idk lol|`|cg5Ka4g2aa	burp in his face.|`|AcPhAx0aaa	you just have to flat out say that you dont want to be in a relationship with him, and that you just want to be friends. its better to be honest than to lead him on for a long time.|`|5e6f827c10807a358ec8c468a0da0047aa	just tell him straight out.. hes a 5th grade ~-~|`|oVtvjSVJaa	Just tell him straight up.

REDO|`|k8socvTVaa	that is very inappropriate for them to say...however u handled the situation poorly...instead u should of told them that u r not dating them therefore they should mind there own business and get a man of there own...instead of worrying about her man.....then u walk out.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	The important thing is what they did after you left them alone and wanting eachother....ahmmm|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Yes, you over reacted.    It's better to laugh it off and reply to her friends saying: "Don't you think that advise would have been much more useful to my wife before we got married???"|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	lmao yes a little ,i hope your makeup  didnt fall out of your bag i hate when that happens|`|EyCeBkUaaa	Beat their asses with your sparkle baton and give them horrible hair cuts!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	That wasn't funny, if it was supposed to be.|`|C0i3t4graa	Evidentlt they didn't know that pink bags are in for all macho men.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	When I was a teen I was in a similar situation and didnt understand what the point was. Well now I do. What I wish I had done was study real hard and pick out an exciting fun career for myself. Think of things you want to do when youre an adult and on your own. Like being an adventurer or discovering the cure for cancer or a million other things. Do research on all the possibilities of what you can do. There are jobs where you can travel a lot, or work for a university doing research. Explore your options and then focus on how to get to that point. Get good grades and go to college and become whatever you wanna be. If you concentrate on your future and not worry about the rest most things will fall into place. In college you will make friends with people who are like yourself, people with the same interests.  So my advice is to make goals on what excites you in life and start working on them now. These problems you are having now will eventually fall away and you will be in more control of your life very soon.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	Well, I know that you don't feel as though you have anyone to talk to, and that's really hard.  But you need to find someone to talk to.  If you don't feel comfortable going to a school counselor then why not call a teen hotline?  There are some really good ones!    http://teenlineonline.org/teens/ is one that is a peer hotline.  You can call or chat with someone on line.  No matter what you do, please find someone to talk to... I grew up in a similar way and ya know what - I made it through and I'm sure glad I did.  Just hang in there!|`|Z0e9BekNaa	Hang in there your life sounds similar to mine, I have a 14 yr old daughter that sounds just like you. Your young yet and hopefully your life will get better as you get older, you can change things before you know it go to college and get a high paying job, car whatever!!!  Don't worry so much about the outside, you seem like a great person. Try religion and prayer if all else fails the Lord Jesus if anyone knows your pain and loves you more than anyone. Take care, jenny|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	im in the same positon as you, i honestly don't know what to say. you can apply to a college or something, or find a job

I simply treated the "new" kids the same - and now that they're all grown, it has worked out just fine.  Would I do it aver again?  You bet'cha!|`|GHd84xipaa	well i am in marriage where the step kids are (37 & 34) they are both in mature and think the world owes them everything.their mother won't let them grow up.so with my experience no it's not worth it.they are both free loaders too.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	I have been a step dad in 2 marriages, since I dont have kids of my own. I had to feel my way through it, I treated the kids like they were my own, assumed debt with them that I will be paying a long time but it was worth it to me. I lived it, we used to fish, ride motorcycles and 4 wheelers together, vacations with kids are a blast,boating, hiking, baseball and football was cool too.. kinda hard to make the games sometimes since I work 60 or more hrs a week,, was late to games a lot, but still showed up....I lovedit.. am currently a step dad to a 18 year old and we work on her car, shop for cool stuff. we ride together on dirt bikes, talk a lot and go for coffee when she needs a mans viewpoint on some issues that she doesnt want to talk about with her mom.. we sometimes cook special meals together,,, her mom loves the relationship we all have as well..it is worth it if all are willing to put effort into it|`|ehAG30Yvaa	What exactly do you mean by "not worth it"? I am a step mom and my husband is a step dad since we both had a son from previous relationships when we got married. There have definitely been times when it's been difficult to be a step parent for both of us but we have a wonderful family with 2 amazing boys and wouldn't trade it for the world! It's definitely not for everybody so if you feel that it's not worth it, make sure you marry someone with no kids.|`|AA10240928	It's not that bad.  The stepson is 21 and is respectful and stays out of trouble.  I pay for school tuition, rent, insurance and other expenses, so it's an expensive responsibility.    If he were my son, I would probably be more strict.  As it is, his mother is very protective.  Probably too protective for his own good.  But it's not a big deal since he is mostly a well behaved young man that is pursuing an education.    Is it worth it?  I guess for me it is.  Although we're related by marriage, I still consider him my family and that pretty much says it all.   Would I feel differently if I had kids of my own?  I don't know.  I would hope that I would treat them all the same.|`|z2lKqIODaa	I am a stepfather. We are both on our second marriage. I have one from my first and she has two from her first, and we are about to have one together.     It can be very challanging, but very worth it. it is always nice to know that you have made an impact on thier lives.    Just watch out for the ex that plays games.
yT3ZNEROaa	Its an expression that is telling you that I love you more than you think I do.  The person may feel that they love you more than you love them, they may be hurt by that.|`|CFU77qCbaa	It's that " I love you so much more than you know. ", haha something like that.

Instead, find some really fun hobbies you enjoy.  This will give you something to do while you're waiting for the boyfriend, and it will make you more interesting to guys.|`|ucfbktFfaa	well theres actually been a study done about girls wearing less clothing being more attractive to guys but...that could very well just be sexual attraction and to much cleavage or skin showing would give the wrong idea....start up an interesting conversation with a guy you like. guys like girls who laugh at their jokes and think they are funny...and always smile, that definitely makes anyone more attractive. good luck hunny!|`|1hinQlz2aa	shave your head and join a cult      OR      get set up with one of your Friends Friend      =)        I want a girlfriend but im ugly|`|ORTMJq0Saa	I I kan be ur bf vezpr13@yahoo.com search for me on myspace    Guys always like notice girls when they dress trampy but are not trampy|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Smile at them.

Gh0qq0s5aa	First of all congratulations on being clean for 9 months.  You should talk to your brother first before blowing the whistle.  Chances are he won't want to hear it but try talking to him first.  If you get nowhere with the talk then you have to tell.  You are doing the right thing because you know first hand what kind of life he's heading for.  Good Luck!

9VhR1XwOaa	You're not in the wrong here.  First off, friends are always supposed to come first.  If his girlfriend was harassing you then he, as a best friend, should have been the first to defend you.  Also, it doesn't seem as if he cares about you as much as you care for him if he's allowing his girlfriend to chose what he says and does with you.  You're concern with him says a lot about who you are.   In the end, all you can do is reason with him.  Sit him down once and for all and tell him how you feel about the situation.  If he is the true friend that you trust him to be then he will listen to what you're saying and take it to heart.  If he pushes away instead of listening, then he's not worth your time hun.  Also, just to toss this in there, everyone has been hurt in the past by one thing or another. That's why we have friends, people to run to when the hurt becomes too much to handle alone.  If he doesn't view you in that way then does he really value you as a person?  Think about it love.    I hope this is helpful  Good luck :)|`|oVtvjSVJaa	Dude, I'm gonna tell you straight up. You need to let her go even if you know her boyfriend is a complete and utter jack... If you hold on any longer, down the road you'll be forced to let her go and the breaking of your heart will only hurt more. Trust me when I say to give her up.
Q1MI6L96aa	It sounds like you have a solid plan for a roof over your head, which is vital. The second part to this is a steady income, since you will need to "pay" your way...even in this situation with family reaching out to you. The best way to say "goodbye" is saying, "goodbye." As you describe things, your mother is not owed a long conversation on this situation....you are an adult and have decided to set a course for the rest of your life. If she can't accept that, then there would be one adult trying to explain things....and that would not be her.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Move out now.|`|u6QOopINaa	Well your question is kinda confusing....first you said that your mom hates you but later u said that it would be hard for my mom.....If she hates you which is hard to believe but if thats the case then figure out what exactly are their feelings and evaluate your options....as moving out on your own is not very easy too!|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	start saving money now then get a very good job then you will be rich and can move into a big house  sounds good doesn't it?|`|GHd84xipaa	sounds like you have a plan to move in with your cousin.now are you working so you paid them for staying there or are you planing on free loading on them?you are 19,so it's time to go out on your own.i really don't see the problem here.tell your mother that you are leaving,she will probably throw you a going away party.
AA10299338	How old is she? Did she grow up poor, sorry, just because you are her grand child does not mean she has to give you anything, its hard to understand, but maybe she is trying to teach you how to save for hard times. Who knows why she is the way she is.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	My opinion is that your are a spoiled brat. Your grandmother bought the tickets, she won the Coach bag. She doesn't owe it to you to give the bag to you. My guess is your bad attitude comes through loud and clear to everyone. If you were sweet and nice to her all your life, I would think your grandmother would be happy to give you the bag since you are such a nice granddaughter. You don't deserve a thing as far as I'm concerned. Think about this. You are in the wrong.|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	thats a long question
fkH2VnFUaa	I don't have much interest in sex toys either. At first it was fun to try but the human touch really can't be replaced or improved upon - unless the improvement is in the skill of the human touch!    I have no interest in some positions that once worked. I think that as I have gotten comfortable with my own sexuality I have given myself permission to just enjoy the sensations of my own body - and know and say what I like and what I don't really care for. I'm a pleaser so it was a leap to focus on myself and be okay with it being all about me for a time.    I tried for a long long time to get really good at what my husband really loves - oral. But he never finishes so I have learned to move to what I know works for him before things go south. I am definitely losing interest in that because there is never a reward and it makes me feel bad!|`|EcCLlRtTaa	SWINGING/PARTNER SWAPPING ORGY    At first, changing partners was fun. You know, the exciting moments when you get to have a taste with new p u s s i e s, and you get to see your beloved one reaching her climax with another guy? Yeah, they pretty much blew your head off. Mutual cheating on the spot. It seems to be addictive.    But as me and my partner realized how our LOVE and AFFECTIONS start to fall apart, we kinda felt sad about it. After days of quarreling and unperformed duties and obligations we came to our senses how wrong it was.     I mean, what about the love? Do we just have to keep on focusing on our sexual fantasies and forget about our more meaningful obligations to each other? Our plans for our future. What will become of us if we continued doing this? Everything that we built and started will soon lose its value.    We gave the lifestyle up and rediscovered that sex the classic way is much more satisfying and exciting after all.|`|u7Q6tUhIaa	I was married 25 years and find in my sexual journies we tried toys as well as role play, fantasy etc. It isnt that you lose interest really. It's that you continually strive to keep things unpredictable and ever changing. Mutual masterbation while you talk about fantasies brings alot of things undone to the forefront.|`|dSpLfZFnaa	Getting screwed by the State.|`|wAJbnHGjaa	Backdoor.

We did it once-it was less than thrilling for me and too thrilling for him.  I told him if we get married we can do it occasionally because I believe in compromise, but it doesn't interest me at all.    And oral sex =-\  I'm working on this one...|`|AA10743159	I don't think it's the sexual activity, that makes one lose interest, mainly because what ever you try for the first time, is always a big kinky and exciting, but it all wears out after a while. Unless you find something you both really enjoy.  Once you have done something, say using toys, or anal or oral sex, once you have experienced the thrill, it's never that exciting again.   Especially if you have done it a lot. Then you usually have to go and try something a bit more kinkier, to get the same thrill.|`|PRUXtYh5aa	I haven't lost "interest" in much of anything.  I still desire to do most of what we used to, with a few exceptions:  porn - we don't need that anymore, oral while driving, public settings, maybe shouldn't do threesomes since married (don't really think about it). She has much less interest in sex than she used to (she was experimental and wanted it all the time until we had kids), but she says she is no longer interested in certain things that she did when younger.  Hers are - May do again for her husband but not now:  certain role playing, anal, outdoors, get back into lingerie. Enjoyed in youth, but no longer interested:  threesomes, women, porn, public locations, the car thing, toys that are too large or too deep, shaving, food and drink.
buCSvGB4aa	I think you should go outside of the circle so you don't complicate your friendship and your relationship. If he has an interest in your friend thats a red flag that he may go behind your back if you did have a romance together.

wAJbnHGjaa	Sometimes porn can cause you to look for a higher level to get excited. I think that sex is 99% mental anyway (sorry ladies). My wife has had trouble (as have I) with having orgasms occasionally. However, when we tease each other through texts or we tell each other about who we flirted with at work, WE EXPLODE! Also, try something different like riding him on an office chair (that was great). Make yourselves into the porn stars and you will attack each other. Also,  use your vibrator when you have sex if you need to orgasm again. Sometimes you just need extra help. Let him talk dirty to you as you use it.|`|INkafu0uaa	yes is true it a mind not only bodies maybe your brains tired of all the extra activates!|`|AA11914352	with me and my husband is the oposite he is a sex freak he watches porn everytime i dont want to have sex wish is like 2 days a week that i dont want it, but i dont think thats why you dont get an orgasm, i think you guys should have more foreplay.|`|54LoXZzpaa	Yea i get like that too, you get used too DIY,  its gets better for me after a few times. But... my hubby is in the NAVY and is away longer than that. Try masturbating while having sex with him, you should reach it, works for me :)|`|uNehLjVDaa	well sort of...the less u orgasm on ur own the more likely you will be horny for later.|`|IvMPh09baa	I think your husband is smoking crack.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	no thats not true  but i did hear that porn destroys your sex life  SO STOP WATCHING IT!|`|vwcDdNfcaa	i dont think so your body may be getting use to it so turn around and tell him he just needs to be better in bed.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Perhaps.  You are used to one type of excitement and may be that's why it is difficult.  You just need to work with your husband and tell him what he should do during sex.  He seems to be a co-operative type person.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	That is NOT true.    A published medical article actually said that masturbation helps a woman to better understand how to be pleasured so to achieve an orgasm.    It's not your masturbation.      I suspect that you are not communicating and/or guiding your hubby on how to best pleasure you so that you can achieve an orgasm.    Of course, if you've started to fancy the physique of all those hung dudes in the porn, it may be more of a psychological reason.|`|uvzuk10Eaa	add some toys into your love making and dress up in sexy clothes show abit of cleavage|`|j6pqXCh9aa	To put is simply yes. Because you pleasure yourself your body has gotten used to that particular type of stimulating  and will only respond to that type of stimulation. try not masturbating for awhile and see how that works for you and your husband. Good Luck|`|qUmZCJ79aa	Yes|`|RdHED7Yhaa	No way its not because of you. Its because he can not bring out the freak in you.  MILDRED is my leader.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I think he needs to watch a educational sex video so he can learn how to get you off. it is very common for a woman to have a hard time getting off without oral stimulation.|`|AA10743159	Yes it can cause a problem, when you masturbate too often. And now when you make love, it's just not the same. So in effect, you have taught your body how to orgasm in a different way, and when he makes love, it's not the same.   You can always help yourself to orgasm while with your husband, if you want to orgasm with him. Or explain to him, what does make you orgasm. Lots of women, rub their clitoris when making love, and it helps them get an orgasm. So give that a try, next time, and see if that helps. If not, then you may have to cut back on the masturbating times.|`|AA11080047	i disagree with your husband. am a guy and i know you need loads of foreplay and consideration when your  with your wife or love one. women need time to get in to a rhythm no t just wham  good night thanks very much sort of thing.
6kJCmxT7aa	If he was just telling you a dream then it probably didn't mean anything. If you don't think of him that way then leave it alone. People dream about crazzy stuff. Unless he said outright that he liked you, treat it the way he said it. It was just a dream, not a fantasy.|`|00nXfQBHaa	If he has a playing history, don't go for him. Tell him that you're happy with your guy and he should stick to his.|`|71VRvldJaa	I personally think he's making it up about the dream!  If you've got a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend, he shouldn't be saying things like that to you. Sometimes questions or comments don't warrant an answer and I think this is one of those times.

I've seen it first hand.Everyone grieves differently. Have you been offered bereavement counseling?There is no timetable for grief.. The local library may have have a bereavement group or check your community listings. Your local hospice may be able to help with bereavement.(you didn't have to be a patient). My sincerest condolences to you and your family.|`|YiDXYsXtaa	awww i am sooo sorry! im only 13 but i know how it feels to loose sum1 u luv maybe u culd (if u hav any family near ur grandma in europe) c if they dont mind helping her at all.... also maybe u culd try to bring her here and live in a retirment home or live in a retirement home there... idk but maybe try sumthing like that????.....|`|2XNVys7Eaa	That is terrible!Don't think about all of the good things that your dad did with you.It just makes it worse and makes you sad.Find all of the good things you like to do with the rest of your family and friends.Try something new to get your mind off of it.Hey,maybe you might even make more friends!I hope for the best for you!I have your family in my prayers.Hope I helped!|`|zQIatfySaa	I am so sorry for your families loss.  I lost my mother when I was 30 I wasnt as young as you are but I can symphathize with your grief.  My grandmother was 88 when my mom died.  We just tried to comfort her all we could and to be there for her anyway we could.  I will be honest it was very hard on her, she never got over my mothers death, and as a parent I understand her loss, we expect to lose our parents as some point in time.  Some of us lose ours earlier than others, but one thing we never expect to do is lose our children.  No matter what the age of the child it is un natural to bury our own children.    Does she have any family and friends in europe.  Maybe you could find her a  place to live her in the US where you can be available to her but not have her living with you.  I would try to find someway for her to stay close to your family but be in her own living space.  God Bless You All.|`|8FuwpE56aa	last april, when i was 13, my dad died from a massive heart attack. i never thought id lose him so early either. the main thing that helped my was my faith. i prayed and read the bible for comfort. if you aren't religious, try talking to a counselor or therapist. look for a support group with people your age who have lost parents. worry about yourself first because if you are in a bad condition, you won't be able to help your grandmother adequately. have her talk o people that she trusts and maybe you could go visit her. she probably won't die from sadness. just be as calm as possible and realize that it will take lots of time. i hope this helps!!    good luck!!|`|w3oVzM2Zaa	Hi im so sorry about your dad.I relate to you alot.My mom passed away a few weeks ago from a heart attack im also like you young(im 20) It was so unexpected.She was so young & my best friend.

She asks where my mom is.But when we tell her she just spoke to her she goes right I did. It is very hard to deal with this.Take it one day at a time.I think you should try to call ur grandma maybe talk a little bit w/ her everyday she will feel really good & u mite feel good yourself.This must be very hard for you im sorry he died that way.I really wish you the best! He really raised a great kid! feel free to contact me.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Write to your European Grandma and tell her what you said here. Tell her how much you loved your Dad and how much you miss him. She will be glad to hear from you. Make a point to write her every week. Maybe send a picture of your Dad and you. You are all in shock and it really helps to talk about your Dad and it would be good to talk about him to your Grandma, too.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I understand what it is like for your grandmother my son died when he just turned 20 & no matter what age a "child" leaves it is never acceptable for a mother.

There is a book called Stephan lives & I had looked at that before my son died & I knew I could ask him to give me signs. I don't have a clue as to what to tell you. People told me to watch Touched By An Angel & it helped because they deal with life, real life like what you are living with. You will see how petty things are now. It is a journey.

I am so sorry.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	What is it you expect strangers on the internet to do?|`|fYTpDEjjaa	i duno. my dad passed away too and i just got really heavy into drugs. i think the way you should handle it is to talk about how you feel about it with loved ones and dont keep things bottled up inside. dont be afraid to cry because it could make you feel better. listen to music and tell storys that remind you of him with your family. thats what our family did.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	I'm sorry for your loss.  I'm sure this has devastated all of you.  I had a thought while reading your question and that was; since you are 19, why don't you go stay with your dad's mom in Europe?  I'm sure having you around will help her cope with losing her son and it will help you too, more than you know.     Good luck to you and all you family.

They don't see through your eyes they only see themselves having a relationship with their brother. So just back off and hope you honey gives you the attention you need. If not join in with them. You might have fun. Family time is family time. Your time together is your time together. As long as he is willing to give you that then you should happy with that. It has to be enough sometime.

They do not have the greatest lifestyle, but they are well taken care of, and they always have everything they need, and I am still in college.Its harder I must admit, but it is really worth it, because when I finish school, and can afford vacations, then they will be old enough to enjoy them.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's a stupid thing to do and cruel to the child.

It's materialistic now, buying expensive things for each other and that's not what it's supposed to be about|`|igkbUflbaa	Only if it happens to me; so no.|`|YTSJR9V1aa	depends on your age, situation and how long youve been together........        but no, its not essential.|`|AA10286634	Hmmmmm let me think.

(Would be nice!!) But not esssential!|`|LZaYblWFaa	Yes and no.    I hate the holiday lol buuut i know on this day lots of people are rubbing boots.lol    and no because love isnt all about sex.|`|QnhSASjBaa	Valentines Day is about being with the person you love. I'm not gonna be here to tell you not to do it, but it really is NOT an essential part of Valentines Day, or even a relationship (outside of marriage) for that matter.     But who ever listens to me...I'm the super Christian dood who's waiting til marriage.|`|QgVxJyARaa	i think sharing the day together and letting your partner know how much you love them is the most important part. I think its important for the guy to do something special for his lady to like roses,chocolates etc.|`|gkefBmnGaa	I don't think its essential, but if you're with the right guy on that day such as I will be....I don't know as if I will get away with not wanting to do it on Valentine's Day. It's going to be our 1 yr and 4 month too =]|`|0128ace84ef892d02fe82e156e193d12aa	No Valentines day is really just a day that couples tell how much they love each other. I don't think you need to have sex to tell someone how much you love them. I mean I understand that people think that you need to have sex to let someone know that you love them but you really don't. I guess its all up to how that person feels about their relationship as far as if you need to have sex on Valentines day.|`|RC5L6AEhaa	no|`|5J8OZAJFaa	if your lucky|`|ysAlWzEvaa	It doesn't have to be. You can find other ways to "fulfill" your lovers needs other than sex but there's no doubt that it ends the day won a good note.|`|ZbmBVpw9aa	ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!!!! Are you not going to? It is important because it marks your sexual activity level for the rest of the year!|`|yq9lgYGDaa	It is definately NOT essential for anything.  Love isn't proved from having sex and if you think otherwise, I hate to be rash, but then I'd have to say you don't know what true love is.|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	Valentines day is about romance.  Romance is much deeper than sex its more emotional.  If you really want the day to be special  create a memory.  Make the day something that won't soon be forgotten,   Example would be breakfast in bed,  candle lit bath,  massage,  have your fortunes told.|`|IO5wDOnxaa	only for a guy hon :)|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	No another day another record sales for hallmark and throrntons and interflora.  If i want sex all i have to do is get my missus a 15 p freddo frog.|`|IfwpibHqaa	for the guys it is babe thats why some of us get valentine card and gifts lol xx|`|838VJJGvaa	Depends on who you are.  I think sex would be great on Valentine's Day, but I'm too young.|`|gHmgBfwxaa	yeah.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	not necessarily  but it probably makes the day a whole lot better|`|7RQDM1HGaa	Absolutely not. Sex is wrong unless you are married.
mpB2agPBaa	do something romantic for her like buy her flowers or chocolate, girls are a sucker for those.|`|FUFD3MhQaa	Figure out time travel|`|mzIfJIQVaa	tell her and ask her what is wrong and why she doesnt like you anymore and i noticed you said "we" dont care about each other that means "you" dont either|`|i7o1zE8Saa	i don't think u can|`|Jve6H4lVaa	You said it yourself. You don't care about each other anymore. If it gets to that point, it's time to break up, or take a break. think it over. then talk about it. see what you've learned. are you better off being friends, or an item?|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Hang out with her and ask her! However you can't MAKE someone like you I wish that you could though!|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	Go all out to show her how much you care about her. Do the biggest thing you can think of.        Figure out a way to leave a flower in every class she goes to during the day, like have someone in each class put it on her desk before she gets in there - for EVERY period|`|180rE9rGaa	grow a bigger penis|`|au9MvNQDaa	give her attention and make her feel like she is the only person in the world that matters to you.  talk to her about this!|`|cBJfldtEaa	do the same things u did orginally like do stuff that shows u really care|`|JEo50kzyaa	suprize her with somthing like flowers or candy or tell her if she dosnt like u then ull kick her in the vigina|`|AA11714191	In the beginning you acted like a boyfriend, then you started to act like a friend.  Start acting like you did in the beginning.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	For now hang-out with her a lot, and chill with her at the movies. Be the nicest damn thing she's ever laid eyes on. Like after you kiss her tell her that she's really beautiful.    Then come Valentines' Day... get her a Teddy Bear holding flowers and a box of chocolates. Then she'll be all over you like a sting ray on Steve Irwin.|`|QYvKXqYUaa	take her to a movie and then out to dinner.while u two r u dinner tell her u like her and u want to get back with her because u always think about her and u love her!|`|QrSFskUpaa	why dont you guys care about each other again? you have to analyze what went wrong and then work on it.|`|KeAwdFIyaa	be more fun|`|BGZ4QBrRaa	get a nice penis and dont smell|`|uuHDQr1paa	I don't even like you and I don't even know you.

If it was more than just a physical attraction there is always hope. Just be real, ask her what went wrong, tell her how you feel.|`|9lCulhIsaa	Talk to her. Maybe you have to settle somethings that have not been settled yet. If she wants to be with you than she will but do not try to force her to like you and do not force yourself to like her. If she doesn't want to be with you at the end, move on. She will not be worth the wait. Trust Me!!|`|qso2kC89aa	win her back. like for example flirt w/ her as if you guys had just met. Tell her she's pretty, compliment her. And be nice to her; and don't push her to anything she doesn't want to do. If you ask her out, and she's sort of busy, don't push her. Don't do anything that might make her upset. Remember you're trying to win her back.|`|zkHwRCm3aa	try and talk to her about the distance you feel growing between the two of you, and let her know how sad you would be without her. kiss her hand, tell her you love her.don't get too mushy girls usually shy away from that. Tell her no matter how far apart you grow, you will always care for her. sometimes girls grow distant if they feel their partner is beginning to get bored, or not showing enough of their feelings. or maybe you show too much. a happy medium is always best. good luck with your girl!|`|I0JpDUuaaa	Well if you really like this girl, you should tell her how you feel. And maybe she still feels the same way, but if she says that she doesn't maybe you should consider moving on because there is know way you can change a girls mind when she has her mind set. Or you could consider penis enhancements... its really your choice. :)|`|BHfP4uWiaa	start being very very nice to her and buy her some jewelery then say have i ever told u how beautiful you are then tell her you are the most beautiful person to me and i really mean it|`|pFMu3jLMaa	Well if you aren't broken up yet the feelings are still there--atleast for now. Spend more time with more. Show the same you showed when you started dating.Obviously something happened in your relationship to distance you from each other. It's okay to take time off but if you don't want to stop not caring. Be yourself and show her you're still the same guy you were when your relationship started, that should do it.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	You should show and tell her how much you really care about her. Do all the things you used to do for her in the beginning, just spice it up a bit more. Do something romantic like take her on a drive to the park and dance under the stars. Tell her how much she truely means to you and compliment her on her beauty a lot (but don't over do it and be cheesy).     If that doesn't work, then maybe you two just need a little time off...I mean, the saying "you don't know what you got till it's gone" is totally true. You seem like a nice guy to care about her enough to win back all of her affection and there aren't a lot of nice guys out there anymore. Chances are, she'll come running back :)    Good luck :)|`|U36GI9FUaa	What ever you do don't panic in front of her because girls don't like that. i had this happen to me too, and I fixed it. O.K. talk about what she likes because if she doesn't like what you are talking about she will break up because you don't have much in common. Here is the plan make her happy than you will be happy.|`|wvdTr3mRaa	Are you sure she doesn't care about you? She could just be really busy and occupied. Maybe talk to her and ask her what's going on. Don't be harsh, but in a gentle way and if she agrees that you guys have lost touch, get together somewhere quiet where you can bond with each other and see why you guys fell in love in the first place. Good luck |`|0L2Un19raa	do something random for to show how much you care about her. buy the chick flowers.|`|pdycD4msaa	dude, its possible you two are growing apart. Im not trying to be mean but blunt and honest, if u really were in love or really cared, u wouldn't have let you two just drift apart. Otherwise, another suggestion, take a break.  If you two are growing apart, or she is just losing interest, straight up, its time to move on.|`|15f69430ae1d19fa7fa1746abfdc9bfdaa	Hang out in front of her house.....It's best if you have several beers before you go. It makes you more charming.|`|CpoPZaQTaa	maybe she isnt convinced enough that u still love her.  go out on a romantic date, show her u still care for her.  when she belives you she might return the same feelings for you.|`|m0XWJfJdaa	dude, there are pills to make your dick larger?!?!  Daaaaaang     Anyway, uhmm, maybe she's seeing someone else, but she didnt want to cheat on you.   IF she's not maybe she just doesn't want to be with you.    Or you can get her flowers, or a purse..shirt.....pen.....book....makeup....  Wow, you would look gay after this! xD   (No offense to gay ppl, yalz are awesome!)
WQWA7L5zaa	Maybe there's a problem with the responsibility of contraception. If she's taking the pill she may resent you for leaving the responsibility entirely on her. You need to probe gently to find out what is the matter. It's not normal that a young woman is not interested in sex. She's trying to tell you something by showing no interest in sex. Or she's testing you to see how much you care to understand her problems.    Some women are unable to open up unless someone is very gentle and very patient with them.|`|yZMx8gw4aa	it gets no better that`s why men cheat|`|IN1X1CVGaa	girls dont always love it as much as guys  and after a while you just get sick of it  so that could be why she doesnt want it as much|`|EOr8VoEVaa	try being more romantic  take her out to a wonderful dinner  or make dinner at home by candel light  no one would be able to resist|`|SSM8aV5Uaa	TIE HER UP AND DO HER ITLL MAKE HER FEEL SEXY [DONT RAPE HER THO LOL]|`|IM9bk1YMaa	Some people don't enjoy sex as much as others. My sister doesnt like it. but, thats normal. Dont beg her, but maby hint her into things and try and be more romantic. =] If she doesnt want it, get over it. Im sure there will be occasions when she wants it.     Im like, SOOO CLEVER XD|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Seek couples counseling.    Don't marry her with this problem unresolved, or you will not have a satisfying marriage.
XGZBEdAWaa	I was 15 and it hurt a little bit but I had no real idea what I was doing and the sex was just terrible ( I laugh about it when I think about it now ). But sex is a learning process and the more that you do it the better you will get at it, I wouldn't go back and change anything even if I could.|`|plBXp91Daa	It depends some women feel little bit pain and some not. It is something you've to experience for your self. I was 19 years old when i lose my virginity and i didn't had much pain.|`|IM9bk1YMaa	Apparently it hurts a bit the first few of times. Thats normal.     I havnt had sex so, I cant give an opinion XD    xx|`|1jk3D9f8aa	i was like 13.     it didn't hurt for me, it just took a couple times before it was completely "comfortable." but i've had friends that said it hurt...i don't believe them ;)|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes it does hurt the first time. i did it at a young age and it didn't turn out too good. I suggest that you do wait until you are a little older if i were you unless you are older. It can hurt physically and emotionally so be careful and make sure the time is right ok.|`|SSM8aV5Uaa	i was 15;; yea it hurt so bad it made me cry|`|YQqYcMjVaa	I was 14 (yes too young) you should wait until your in a stable, loving and trustworthy relationship before you even think about being sexually active! Your virginity is important and you only get it once. Wait for someone who you love and they love you and make it special! Whwn I lost mine, many years ago now, It hurt for about 2 seconds, and it's a bit uncomftable the next few times you have sex but it gets alot better. Hope this helps :-) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|mw7975jeaa	I was 16. I didn't hurt too much at all for me. I think that if you jump from making out to the next level then it will hurt more. However, if you are fingered a lot before then it probably wont hurt as much. Just don't be hasty, only do it when you're ready.

LCAzlHhEaa	I grew up Catholic and my husband converted to Catholicism before we even met.  After we got engaged I called my church to see what dates where available; after we picked a date then we had to go to pre-marriage counseling.  We went once a month for six months before the wedding.  In addition to the counseling with the priest that will marry you; you will also need to complete a pre-cana course. This course varies from a weekend retreat to a day camp depending on what your parish offers.  The pre-cana has to be completed before you are married and you will have to prove completion by providing a certificate to your priest from the pre-cana course.    After all that is done then you are ready to marry in a Catholic Church.  Since you live 7 hours away I would see if the priest would allow you to take the counseling with a local priest; however some priest will not allow that so it's all up to the discretion of the priest at your home parish.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Someone needs to call the priest at the church where you want to be married and see  1.  If it's possible to get you through the dioscean required marriage preparation in 5 months  2.  Whether the church is available on the date you want|`|wMWfCjBpaa	YES YOU CAN! You two will have to complete marriage preparation classes soon though. On average it takes about 4 months to do, meeting once a week. Some parishes offer it on a weekend, some do it in six months, it varies on the director of the class. Call around.    If you haven't spoken to the church yet, get ready to answer some serious questions. One of you must be a Catholic in good standing with the faith to get married in the church, which she already is. The whole sex, living together, and other issues will come up. Basically, are you living a good christian lifestyle? Living what the Bible teaches. If so, you're more than ready to go! If not, make those changes for the next five months.     Start planning now! CONGRATS!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	The first thing you need to do is call churches and see who has openings around the time you want.  Planning a wedding in 5 months will be a LOT of work.  Especially since you are going with a catholic church you will be forced into pre-marital classes which just adds to the stuff you have to do.  So good luck. I hope you guys can have the wedding of your dreams.|`|kqxrBiE4aa	Yeah u can definitely make it happen but it is really cutting it close. My fiance and I are planning it for august and our priest said they usually need 6 to 7 months in advance. In order to marry at a church you need to complete precan sessions( don't ask!) and some questionnaire. As far as the church, u should check to see if they have a website, many churches do, it will normally give you step by step information. Good luck!|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	My brother and his fiance were engaged in September and married first week of Feb. in a Catholic church.  And he's not even Catholic.    Just call the priest at the church where you want to be married and see if that is something he can accommodate.    If he can't, I'm sure you will find a priest that can.    They kept the wedding fairly simple and chose a reception site that didn't require a lot of decorating.      No worries.

How would she know if you were cheating anyway? That's ridiculous...and ridiculous for him to believe her.  =/    I think he might be a little naive and immature if he believes her.|`|AA11126544	Have a blood test done once the baby is born.|`|L06tXG2Jaa	Yea, get a paternity test.  If you can't afford one call Maury.  Good luck.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	If your boyfriend is man enough to have unprotected sex and a baby is the result, he is man enough to stand up to his mother and tell her to butt out.  If he is not, you need to rethink your parental options.      If you are a gluten for punishment then stay in this relationship and for the next 9 months or so you will be trying to prove the child paternity to the father and to his mother.  Then what?  You proved it.  She will never admit that she was wrong.  She will always say you are a tramp.  Always.      Then you will have to take the boy to court and I'm sure his mother will tag along, and try and get child support from someone who is not working or probably will never hold down a decent job.  Tons of money, tons of time off from work to appear in court, tons of phone calls trying to get that back child support etc. . . and I haven't even mentioned child visitation issues.      You might consider adoption.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	do a paternity test after the baby is born and resolve this matter|`|Ikd9cppcaa	If you want a relationship with this guy, you need to be nice to his Mom. There are paternity tests after the baby is born. Don't get in a battle with his Mom because your boyfriend will have visiting rights to his baby, too. And it's the Mom that will be caring for your baby. Just tell them both that he is the father. You will have to wait until after the baby is born to prove it. Good luck and it sounds as if you will need it.|`|tao83sDxaa	dna will tell the truth.|`|0GZ7OIVsaa	DNA test.|`|ScHW4842aa	Ask him to bear with you .    Sit  him down and  tell him that you would not do that to him. and that you can see why his mother is acting this way.     tell him that you will get a  paternity test done after  it  is  born.
EJwLM8D9aa	This is a tough question. From the law's perspective (not the personal view of the police you dealt with specifically), neither act was justified. Indeed, since the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, police have the right to arrest a person suspected of abusing his significant other without the compliance of the potential victim. You and your husband, then, had full prerogative to call the police even if your sister was against the idea. In choosing to act violently himself, your husband performed in a vigilante manner, which is itself illegal, despite questions of morality.    That being said, questions of morality play a big part in a situation like this. What it means for a person to enact violence against another--without the buttress of the law behind him or her--is extremely personal. From your husband's perspective, your brother-in-law performed an act that was so horrendous to him he (apparently) couldn't fathom not taking action himself--punishing the offender with a kind of eye for an eye justice. Was it wrong? Again, this depends on your own definition of morality, which, as the plethora of answers above me demonstrates, varies greatly among people. I personally would like to believe I would have the control to call the police in that situation--to make sure this man could never do that to my sister again. But then again, if my sister were to show up at my house, covered in bruises--cowering and bloody--I'm not sure I would be able to handle seeing my own extremely independent and strong sister rendered meek and afraid by a man who claims to love her. Despite everything I know is right from the perspective of the law, I might not be able to stop myself from landing at least one punch. Even so, that doesn't make my (theoretical) action "right" or "justifiable." It does, however, make it understandable.|`|7dMaEG7Eaa	your sister's husband... you need to give us more detail about him (was he alcoholic, drug abuser, etc.)    why did your sister get bruises?    well, i think it  wasn't a great choice... using violence to solve problems... but i'm just worried about the future, not the present. Now your sister is stuck with a bill... and must work with her husband to forget about this incident.|`|3wzxsvxAaa	nah i dont think so|`|Wt81sGW5aa	if he beat your sister he deserves it|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	I have to agree with you. Violence is never the answer, no matter what they did. If he wanted to handle it with class, he should have just called the police and got the man arrested.|`|QHx95iZDaa	your sisters husband got what he deserved.|`|utcnajvsaa	While I normally would agree with violence solves nothing, some lessons do have to be learned the hard way. Now your sister's husband feels the pain he put your sister in. It may have been to a greater extent, but at least your husband got the message through his head: Don't put your hands on a woman if you're going to hurt her. Really, if I were your sister, I'd leave this guy.|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Heck yes that was justified.  Props to your husband, but a trained boxer may or may not have been a little overkill.  Good work anyway, though.|`|Mbx4Aty7aa	It is never justified.  The only thing that happened is your husband stooped to the level of your brother in law.  What did that solve?  Are things better now? - I doubt it.  They're probably worse.    Revenge is NEVER the answer!|`|8te6mUHIaa	meee ;)  yer husband had the right .  your sister was beaten up first .  anyhow, how can you not go with your husband or sister? x;|`|bxxwhP04aa	I believe there ought to have been a better way to handle this. Violence is not the answer in this situation.  Calling the police before your husband took matters in his own hands should have been done.  The police would have arrested your sister's husband.  And no violence done.|`|KB007gFYaa	a man should never hit a woman|`|t92F9YwTaa	it was  comepletely justified unless your sister was cheating on him.|`|9lCulhIsaa	No it was not justified. They both should have suffered consequences.  Violence is not the answer.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You need to support your husband, no matter what you think.  Even though in the real world he'd be in jail.  And could still end up there if the other guy decides to press charges or take him to civil court to make him pay the hospital bill.|`|QrSFskUpaa	I can understand that your husband did that. But it is between your sister and her husband. Your husband is lucky that the police was on his side.|`|PzbRJrTKaa	your husband did good'.! your sisters husband has no right to put his hand on a female'.!|`|XsYMMZ9Paa	Well, maybe not in the eyes of some.  A human being has no right to harm another human being lest they have a good reason. So, because your sister's husband beat her, your husband did have somewhat of a right to punish your sister's husband. Especially if he left her bruised and the such.   It does sound a bit extreme what your husband did to injure him THAT badly, but the man DID hurt the person he'd sworn to love.   So, yeah, in a sense it is justified of what your husband did.   Of course, to put him in hospital needing 20 stitches...is a bit much.|`|wrs4kLReaa	violence is never ok. but he had it coming, he will think twice before he puts his hands on her again.|`|L06tXG2Jaa	I think he got what he deserved.  You just don't decide one night to leave bruises on your Wife.  Abuse starts gradually and I suspect this has been going on for some time.  Abuse will only continue to get worse over time unless she leaves, dies or they both get counseling.
aRDXTWIDaa	two words: pysical contact brush his hair back, pull a piece of "lint" off his shirt, give em a "friendly hug" etc|`|TliiyvnKaa	Talk to him, and make physical contact like touching his hand. Smiling and looking shyly into his eyes...God ima professional!:)|`|OVOjwnPZaa	omg dana's a lint picker. hahahaha.     hahaha i know who this is about=] idk hun. no idea what to tell you. wish i could be of more help.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	smile and say hi and just step on the back of his heels and laugh and act like you didnt do it|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You can do it once in every other day.|`|hqBkLu40aa	The number one way to flirt without being "slutty" is to simply use your eye's and smile. by using your eyes I don't mean undressing him with them....|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Be a little interested. and act mature while flirting or else you going to seem like you're in 6th grade! flirty eyes is my favorite one! but do what comes natural. Good Luck!|`|b8WLu1kbaa	When you flirt all you got to do this    Tell a boy he has nice hair or nice shoes or nice anything tell them your name and walk away     works every time for me|`|1hinQlz2aa	Only flirt with one person and don't do it so often. If you do it too much, it will seem like your throwing yourself at a guy. =)|`|E859HitSaa	Don't.|`|qIk5AdYeaa	act a little to 'friendly'    help me?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|skZcJ3k3aa	Tease the boys.  Instead of going all the way  just give a little and  leave him wanting more form  your kiss x]]  Works everytime  As soon as you can tell hes  really into it...  Push Him Away|`|66jX06Onaa	Smile gently, speak softly, dress like a lady, and be sweet. That is the 'lady' way to flirt.|`|uvzuk10Eaa	if you want to get someones attention just be yourself and if he is attracted to you he will talk to you if he is not then your not supposed to be with him|`|4CINI0fsaa	its all about smiling :) look at him then smile when he looks back|`|7HBTvg8Caa	You can smile and wave, and act really happy to see whoever it is. Hug them, giggle at their jokes, compliment them, find little ways to touch his arm...
NEw5dsJlaa	Maybe you should let her rest in peace since she gave you such enormous generosity.  I'd put the money towards bettering myself.. Taking a class or enrolling in college. You could pick up a hobby like photography and buy some professional equipment, start a business, or just throw it in the bank for an emergency fund. A car is a good investment, if you need one, but I wouldn't buy new. Seeing that you're being so flippant about a large sum of money, you're probably spoiled and completely unaware of the current economic turmoil.|`|3mAgM405aa	LP's response is right on.  Use the inheritance to improve your education so you can make your grandmother proud.  Show some respect for her especially since she has passed away.  Isn't about time for you to grow up and become kinder and more forgiving as you become more mature... more charitable.  Remember your grandmother could have left you with just $1.00, so she really didn't carry any bad feelings towards you as she approached her dying days!    Good luck!|`|sCr2iTczaa	NO. Even though you dislike your grandmother i think you should use the money on something use full... maybe house payments, bills, you could also get that car you say you want. Why would you waste 20,000 on waste less stuff. Come on man. The economy in struggling and you just want to blow all your money away. Be responsible with your money don't waste it on sex if you can get that for free.
RQD7Z0eXaa	Talk to your friend about it.  That is really the only way to get your point across to him that you don't want your friendship to end.  If he doesn't want to hear what you have to say, then that's his problem, but it would be a real shame to lose a good friendship like the one you two had.|`|AQ3QqA5daa	Stop calling him and see if he likes it!    Dude he's using you at the mo as he got "new" friends or summat. Chill out with your mates and let him deal with things his way until he calls you.|`|PBe2qbXNaa	Good luck....this is your choice....you talk to him already....the only thing you can do is decide what you really want.....continue to talk to him or give up?  its going to be a hard choice. again Good luck|`|R0jKoq6Kaa	yeah, you probably should say something to him. i mean, you guys have been best friends for a long time and, that's really precious. ask him what's wrong, does he still want to be your friend. or maybe he found one of your flaw really unacceptable? because that's what I was acting like to MY BEST FRIEND when i found one of her flaws really, really, really, really unacceptable . . . . just try to talk to him and, well, tell him if he see some of your flaws, that you can change, and something like that.    good luck!|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	It's totally up to you whether you talk to him about this. It sounds like he's got in with other people and is trying to impress them, therefore leaving you on the back burner.     It's completely understandable that you feel this way, I would too. It appears he's using you at the moment, only seeing you for when he needs something from you. You could explain how you're feeling, as he might have got so caught up with other people that he's forgotten how much fun you guys used to have. On the other hand, maybe he wants to have more friends other than you.     The best way is to talk to him and find out if he's aware of what is happening. Good luck.
qmEitkZ2aa	when you wake up and real life is better than your dreams   :)|`|GhETSRdUaa	You just know.    I think being in love is when there's 2039203920392039 things wrong with that person, but you're just as accepting of them, and you couldn't care less. I think it's when Brad Pitt, or the Jonas brothers, can walk by, and you won't even desire them in the least bit as long as you're with that person.|`|AA11334468	You listen to a love song and think of them or do something you usually do by yourself and know it would be so much better with them there|`|OBuzcIDbaa	If you have to ask, then you're not.  If you truly love someone, you would be willing to sacrifice your own happiness for his. If you wouldn't, you don't love him.  A lot of people think they're in love because they are lusting after someone. That's not love. It's good if you have that too, but alone it's not love.|`|wvdTr3mRaa	When your in love you'd do anything for that person. You'd sacrifice yourself for them. There wouldn't be one flaw you could find with that person because to you they'd be absolutely perfect in every way. That one person would be able to either crush your heart or make it warm. When you're in love you just know. |`|Mfi2lCxpaa	when all you do is think of them all day dream about them at night and everylove song reminds you of them my sweet lori makes me feel this way|`|0128ace84ef892d02fe82e156e193d12aa	Well most people are saying you wouldn't be asking this question but that's the truth. But when you're really in love you know. You get this feeling when you're around them like nothing can go wrong. You just all around feel like you're on top of the world.|`|vWnVopWyaa	you'd just know. you wouldn't have doubts and you would not ask anyone if they knew how they knew. Trust your heart and gutt.|`|TqfpkTtwaa	u kinda just kno... except if ur in high school, (usually lesser than a senior) then its just teenager lust... usually not love... Love USUALLY happens after highschool, or sometimes in your senior year of highschool. if saying the person you love's name is kinda awkward sometimes, butterflies in your stomach, you just want to walk up to them and tell them but at the same time you feel like you will never be able to tell them, then thats pretty close to love. but DONT trick yourself into thinking you love them. It may not make sense now but if you think about it people trick themselves by askin themselves "do i really love them?" (which is the first sign of NOT being in love) and then they are just like "ppsshh of course i do" (which is the second sign). so yea u'll probly feel it. just dont mistake it for lust. Usually lust happens when you see them and you are just like (eh mah gawd.....i looove him.......). true love takes place when you get to know the person. So if you dont know the person you love, its probly lust, so try talkin and stuff or just kinda say "Hi" a few times to start things off. Love will just happen, thats all there really is to it. dont search frantically for it because it will find you|`|Fvh6y6chaa	When you're around him, you feel nervous and happy at the same time. And sometimes you get lost in you're mind just looking at him and you get butterflies in you're stomach.

rywgn8HLaa	If you feel close with this girl then you should definitely ask her to be a bridesmaid. If you think she is going to be reliable, helpful and will keep you calm then you should include her in the wedding party.   Just ask her - and tell her that she doesn't have to say yes because you understand she doesn't know anyone and lives a few hours away, but you would love to include her.   I am in my friends wedding in August. Her bridesmaids didn't know one another, but they are nice people and have been very easy to communicate with. I'm sure that your bridesmaids will be welcoming to this girl if you decide to have her in your wedding party.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	If you want her as a bridesmaid, then ask her.|`|YgggHhwuaa	If it is someone that you think you will be life long friends with, then I say make her a maid. If it is someone who you are friends with but don't know the longevity of the friendship, then just invite her.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If you feel close enough to want her to be one of your bridesmaids, then ask her.  None of my bridesmaids knew each other.  Actually, and none of the groomsmen knew each other either.    Just because someone is in your wedding party, it doesn't mean they have to be close friends with everyone else in your wedding party.        If she is shy and uncomfortable around people that she doesn't know, either she can decline, or you can invite her to spend the weekend at your house and over the course of the weekend, she can meet some of your friends and family.|`|fTpk7ospaa	i think you should ask her to be a bridesmaid. if she wants to she will say yes. if she feels uncomfortable not knowing the other bridesmaids then she will turn it down. And besides they will bond over knowing you and being bridesmaids on your special day. so go for it.|`|AA10975867	Ask yourself these questions: If she was the one getting married, do I know her well enough and like her well enough to spend $$ to go to an out-of-town wedding, to spend $$ on a dress and shoes and hair plus a gift, to spend $$ on helping throw a shower for her. If you feel in your heart that YOU would be willing and happy to spend almost $1000 if you were HER bridesmaid, then - and only then - ask her to be your bridesmaid. Being invited to your wedding is really enough.|`|2Wq1LCgnaa	I think you should tell her that you would like her to be one, but if she thinks she'll feel uncomfortable or just plain doesn't want to, then that's her decision!|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I would ask her to be a bridesmaid; that means a lot. She might feel left out if you didn't ask her when y'all have become close and she is just a guest at your wedding. She isn't going to know anyone there or at the reception or whatever anyway. If she says that she would kind of feel uncomfortable or something, at least you asked and you can tell her that you understand.  Don't go into the explanation that you understand if she doesn't want to do it since she won't know anyone when you ask her. That might make her more uncomfortable. Chances are that she will be able to talk to the other girls and your family and get along just fine. Ask her!

0tKNkAMuaa	First off I'm very sorry, I've been in this situation many times, and it hurts when your friends misjudge you. You should try your best to talk to her. At school ask if you can talk to her privately, then ask her if she is mad at you, and your sorry for what ever you did. Explain to her what you thought, and that you really want to be best friends again. Try to call her home phone if she wouldn't pick up her cell phone and do the same thing. I would try my best to stay in contact with her, cause you obviously care about her, and want to stay bffs. I hope she excepts what you are saying! *best of luck!*|`|PBe2qbXNaa	lol......typical problem....i think smile will help|`|f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	Simple.  Talk to her.

7HVsVspOaa	I have found that "Congregational" churches are more likely to rent their space than churches that belong to major religions. This makes perfect sense as they are self supporting. Sometimes they want to ok the ceremony to ensure it is within their beliefs, or at least nothing they consider sacrilegious. In my area there are also historical sites that happen to be churches and Unitarian fellowships.    Good luck and happy planning!|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.      I'm a church secretary (Lutheran Church), so here is what I know......    First of all, you will probably have a hard time getting a church.  You can't just "rent" a church (like you do a reception venue).  Yes, most churches/pastors DO want you to not only be that faith, but also be a registered member of that particular parish.    You can call around and ask, but it will be hard.  Also, most churches don't let you bring in your own officiant.  I can tell you that will be a definite no-no.  The officiant at that particular church will be the one to do the wedding.    It probably would be best for you to be married in a chapel.  Yes, there ARE chapels that you can rent.  They are for the sole purpose of having couples rent them for weddings.  Look online using Google and type in "wedding chapels in [your city, state]" and see what comes up.     You can also be married at many other places (non-religious) such as a garden, park, etc.  Then, you don't have to worry about the officiant.  Obviously, it will be OK to have your own officiant.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I don't know about other churches, but I know my church would be willing to rent out their chapel for something like that.  It's a Unitarian Universalist one.  You can always try calling up different churches in the area and asking.|`|m13CCGc1aa	I'm pretty positive that most churches (Catholic churches anyway) will require that you are that religion in order to get married there.    If you are going to get married at a Catholic church, both people will need to be Catholic.  They will likely make you take Catholic pre-marriage counseling and will likely require both of you to have been confirmed in the Catholic faith.|`|8ygky5g4aa	A lot of churches do require you to be a member, not just that religion, but a lot of non denominational churches and Unitarian churches do rent their church for outside weddings.    Just find some non denominational or Unitarian churches in your area, go check them out and then give the church office a call to find out if you can reserve the church or what their requirements are to be married there.    Good luck!|`|zaSyEcnqaa	You need to contact different churches and ask. They are all different. My finance and I attend a non-denominational church that is not conducive to ceremonies at the sanctuary since it seats 5000 and it very modern and huge    We are marrying in a Baptist church with our own pastor. I actually had several churches in town offer their churches for a fee.  But I also had many churches tell me no.     The Baptist church knows our pastor well and was very reasonable in price and has no restrictions for us. It is a blessing.   (but no center aisle- so I will be coming down a diagonal side aisle) You should just use your church.
Ikd9cppcaa	No. It means she eats a lot of foods that cause gas.|`|gwyMH4NSaa	Maybe she has major gas, or her boyfriend has a huge *$ %|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	OMG! I do anal and my farts are not sloppy|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	what kind of question is this?|`|1D2UiAJeaa	i believe that is something that is not yet proven.
M5oMYc9Laa	My son now 30, grew up not knowing his father and has only recently become acquainted with him.  He has had issues with drug addiction, anger, depression and been in trouble with the law.  I had no idea when he was a child that he was so angry.  I thought that a loving parent was all he needed but that was not the case.  Get counseling for your son right away!  Abandonment is a very bad for a young child to have to experience and he will be very, very angry.  It could potentially mess his life up.  He will need a positive MALE role model to try to help ease some of his pain.    You also will need all the support you can get to help him cope.  One day my son came home from school with a father's day card he was forced to make for a school project.  It broke my heart.  I know you love your son and will do all you can for him but don't forget about yourself.  You will need help and healing too.|`|4WjB4tHjaa	That's what happened to my Dad.  It affects me today because I don't socialize with guys as much as I would if my Dad was there to be there for me.  Just support him as much as you can and he might forget about it.|`|AA12223669	There is no way to know. He will probably be affected by this his entire life. Different reasons for leaving will give him a different perspective.    If his father passed away, and you always made the father out to be a hero, your son would grow up with confidence that his father is watching out for him and he'll grow into a good man.    If his father is a scumbag and left and you made it clear that his father isn't a good person, he'll likely go through teen angst.     It's all about his perspective. I think it's important to be honest with your son about his father's reasons for leaving, without putting too much personal opinion in there. If the man was a good father, tell your son that. But if he was a lousy husband, there is no need to divulge that personal information.    The least amount of hate your son has for his father is best, even if he isn't a good man - thats your sons job to find out in time.|`|BHGAAAJVaa	Well I remember that when my parents got divorced it was an on and off thing for me.  Half the time I was being with my dad and half the time I was with my mom.      Your son will probably be a little lonesome without his daddy.  After all having a dad is a large impact on one child's life.  It was on mine.  All the memories I have of him is him being an idiot.  Just make sure you have a fun time with your son but never let him get out of control when he's older because mid teen is when a lot of the trouble starts.  Good luck to you.|`|E3Lheqoeaa	Well, the same thing happened to me and I turned out ok. I had a step-dad from a fairly early age too, so that helped a bit. If you've got a more specific question, feel free to send an e-mail.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	he will be confused, is he close with him?|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	take your son out and about and let him meet people, don't keep him alone and do the best you can for him|`|k8socvTVaa	yes this could effect ur child because it is proven the most children without a male influence can turn out a bad child...however u could change that by telling him the truth...when he ask u about his father don't tell him that daddy will come back when u know he won't because ur going to give him that feeling that his father will be back and when he finally grows and accept the fact that his father is not coming back then he will believe that its his fault....so tell him the truth and don't lie|`|IN1X1CVGaa	it will affect him a lot  my dad said bye the morning before he left  and left while i was in kindergarten  i cried for idk how long  it killed me  a dads a big part in a kids life  i didnt know why he was gone, and wouldnt come back  and i felt like he didnt want me anymore :/|`|Q1MI6L96aa	You need to get a good support system - friends and family - around him and answer every question he has about this situation. It can have psychological consequences that may not outwardly appear until years later.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	It will only affect him if you continually remind him about his father leaving. Treat it as if the father died. Say nothing bad about him since he may drift back into your son's life later. Otherwise, you will be the one your son dislikes for saying bad things about his dad.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	it will affect him alot kinda like me|`|gwyMH4NSaa	Well he will never have a male companion to take him to sports games, or show him how to play. This happened to my aunt, and she had to play the role of both the mother AND the father. It was challenging but if you have family, you will get through it. Also, if he his around too many woman, he may grow up to be metro-sexual, which is when a man acts gay, but is really straight. They act feminine because there was no male to show him the way males act.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Theres really no way to know. It is a private thought at that age that he is feeling or will feel in the future. Young kids brains function differently at each age, each age from birth has its own realities and understandings. The less said by you the less pain for the child. The more he sees you crying, yuo on the phone countless times recanting the ex leaving, over and over, that would not be good for him. Its not about him knowing your a good mom, so he needs no words to assist what he knows. If it was me, at first I would say that dad went to work far away, and hope dad comes around soon, and when he leaves let that be the good bye remembered. Sorry its happened. I hope you can cope enuogh to not try to gain stregnth from your son eyes. I only say this as, as a witness to many many many divorces and seperations, even the absolute best moms out there, forget easily what is age appropriate. We all seem to think that more the more our childs speak and increase thier vocabulary, that they understand too what they are hearing, and it is completely not true. Realize too that sometimes the missing parent, the child holds in more esteem than the parent that is right there in thier face showing them love and caring for them, and this too is true. Since the small child cannot see for themself that the missing parent is "ok", they often fear the worst, secretly. My youngest counselor in school clued me into her behavior change and was able to coat out of her, what I was not able too. My ex had relocated and I went and picked him up weekly for awhile to help my kids cope more. We as parents, cant be inside our kids minds so we say the least we can, so that we have no words to regreat later on.
rApLHbmWaa	I believe in the saying, "A dog is a mans best friend!" They listen when you talk and lick your tears away when you cry... They are always there for you whether you are pretty, ugly, black, white, rich, or poor!  They actually set a great example for us humans!  It would be ok if you cry over your dog for the rest of your life and that wouldn't mean that you have problems! Some times when things are going good in our life we tend to forget the bad for a little while! Maybe it is just now hitting you, or maybe you are struggling with something in your life.. school, home, whatever it may be and it is bringing out your emotions because you don't have your true friend (your dog) beside of you while you are growing up and experiencing different things in life!  If it is something that stresses you out just do whatever you have to do to make it a positive thing... take his pictures and make a video about him that everyone can see on youtube, or decorated his grave sight in order to feel a bit of that connection you had with her back then.  And it may even be time for a new companion it you don't already have one!  Good luck with everything and god bless you through it all!|`|2pDKXnkZaa	No your dog was a special part of your family so it's fine to be upset.|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	your still thinking of your dog and it will take time for you to get over this
SHdrYV0Naa	in my opinion no i wouldn't feel weird, however it does depending on the situation like are you guys dancing or just being silly in the case i would feel a lil surprised but would just go with the flow.  If she is a flirty type and trying to get you excited in so many words and trying to be sneaky then everything is good don't worry.  I'm pretty sure she likes it.    P.s how old are you guys?  this could also determin how she feels|`|1nkehxC0aa	personaly i would start laughing  it would be funny not weird  4 me at least.  dnt trip man|`|fc4U6217aa	Dude!!!Go for it man...wip it out and slam her!!!HAHAHA
71VRvldJaa	If he asks a stupid question like that, give him a stupid answer back!  Tell him  you don't like it because it would look better with 2 eyes!|`|iehpDiZ8aa	Well its a weird topic to be talking about in the first place but I guess you should tell the truth or if you aren't comfortable telling him, then just say that you don't want to discuss this|`|SHdrYV0Naa	what ever you do don't lie!  if you have to say something harsh try to soften it up.  ex.  i like it because you **** good, instead of that say i like it because you know how to make me feel good and loved.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	tell him the truth! haha  i tell my boyfriend the truth  all the reasons why i do|`|IM9bk1YMaa	I'd say what I think. but, if its harsh, then, I'd say it in a nice way. :S    I dont really know sorry.    take care xx
CFU77qCbaa	If she's not your best friend, don't get her nothing.|`|sp80uzmLaa	money$$$|`|pg5r8kuxaa	bake her , her fave cookie or brownie or something but do it from scratch means more... put it in a cute container or something and yes give her a card. money is also very good
iehpDiZ8aa	Well tell them that you want time to hang out with your friend or just simply tell them that you are not interested in them and only want to be their friends|`|uTni4vOQaa	3 u lucky beeatch  Stop complaining.....
700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	he could've just been really nice. some guys are just gentlemenly like that. rare, but still true. if you really want to know if he likes you, you have to get closer & explore into your relationship a bit. [i just sounded like a fortune cookie]|`|CA9OFT4Waa	you have to look at his track record, does he normally do nice things for girls that he isnt really good friends with? i wouldnt think too much into it, but you should send him a quick text saying thank you for helping you find your way, and just make small talk, because the worst that could happen is you two become better friends instead of developing a relationship.|`|O8pPNMm8aa	honestly.......most guys wuldnt really do that for a chik unless he was really into her|`|ucfbktFfaa	i agree....i think he likes you.|`|SXh0FDHzaa	sounds like he is majorly into you    most guys wuld have like gave you map quest directions haha  but this guy went out of his way (and gas) to come get yoyu    i think u are both the perfect match =]    good luck=]|`|kC1xE1tgaa	in my point of view, i think he was just being a gentleman. i think you're the one that likes him lol but still i hope this helps.|`|a2Humrleaa	sounds like he likes you...guys dont really do things like that just for the hell of it anymore. good luck =]|`|iyRczu0eaa	He likes you..at least as a friend. BUt Im thinkin he sees it as more considering he went out of his way to help you...|`|ySvWezDdaa	i don't want to burst your bubble, but he may just be a gentleman.  keep watching for more signs though, maybe he really likes you!! i know my brother's like that, if he knew a girl was lost, especially at night, he would go help her out, and it doesn't mean he's interested in her necessarily.  so like i said, don't jump to conclusions because most guys today are NOT gentlemen and so maybe he really does like you after all.  just keep your eyes open and good luck!!|`|cdXMQai8aa	He sounds gay to me. It sounded like a Nice thing to do, not a flirty thing.|`|GhbFkt8Iaa	awww how cute sounds like he like you! come on what guy would ever do that just to be nice?|`|sDNrVaWSaa	i think he probably likes you because guys are really into football so if he left just to pick you up then he's probably interested. good luck with him! ;]|`|Ak6HLE5oaa	umm i thynk he was doing it to be nice so dnt get yur hopes up!!!
JWCUUxlkaa	The age difference sounds a little iffy considering he's a legal adult and you're still considered a child by law most likely until you are 16 unless your state says differently. If you do form a relationship, just don't involve yourselves in sexual activity, or he could end up in prison for statuary rape.  On a higher note, I'd say if you really like this guy, go for it. The 45 minute distance seems alot, but if you have good communication though, it's likely the relationship can last.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I thought you didn't want your parents thinking it was anything more than just friends.  If he cares about you, he'll respect their wishes.|`|1hinQlz2aa	WAIT TILL YOU ARE 18 IF YOU GO OUT WITH HIM OR ELSE HE WILL BE ARRESTED|`|QYvKXqYUaa	well...first of all i'm a girl!  i think he likes u cause if a boy ask for my phone number that usually means he like me and u talk to him everyday defiantly he likes u u should ask him if he likes anyone.
EYLSyeajaa	ugh. thats why dating older works better for me. im still a teenager & dont have a need to 'relive my youth' with a younger dude.. huh. but older guys are more likely to pressure you into sleeping with them.. then again younger guys sometimes lack the maturity..     sorry, kay rant over ;]     ahh, undefined relationships. been there, done that. those are the less serious ones that you just kick back & have fun with.. until the golden day he introduces you as his gf..     maybe hes too young, shy, or self-conscious.. theres no way to know other than to ask him. but keep it light-hearted, guys dont like getting the relationship talk too early, seems clingy..    you dont really have to do anything more elaborate than 'hey do you want to go to prom with me ?' thats fine. but if you want to go with something more memorable..    (a) write your date info on small slips of paper (time, place, date, type of dress, etc.) then slip each one into a different balloon. inflate the balloons & tie them together with ribbon or make a bouquet out of them. deliver them to his house, classroom, or work.    (b) borrow your kid brothers remote control car [or buy one] & tape the invite to it. deliver it to him. [you could bring it to school & bump it against his feet/make it jump out of his locker]    (c) wrap the invite in aluminum foil & bake it in a cake. put a clue in writing [frosting] on the cake so he eats it quickly & finds it..    im immensely proud of you for reading all of this ! haha ;]    best of luck,  have fun at prom & dont get your tongue stuck on the ice sculpture ! :D .. even though it looks wicked awesome !|`|5TgTKrVwaa	how young is he, dont date him, he might be immature    plus go to college.      you will find tons of guys. mature and immature|`|CnM2U1bXaa	http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com/|`|7pdDEGsXaa	Well first of all, i would say depending on far away the prom is he will prolly ask you. if its coming up soon, i would just ask him striaght up! and you need to ask if you are exclusive becuase if not you dont want to find out later, sooner than later is always better!|`|aRDXTWIDaa	asking a gut out is always tricky, but you just gotta buck up and a nike would say "just do it!".  I'm sure he really likes you and no matter what happens you can fix it. no reason to obsess or worry it'ss all b fine in the end. :)|`|ndW3nWWHaa	If you're having commitment issues, let him ejaculate on your face. If a girl let me bust a nut in her face at that age, I would have married them!    As far as prom goes, let him ejaculate on your face. He'll probably say yes to anything after that!    Hope this helps!|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	just say it! and you shoudl ask him out!|`|2thQbeAYaa	just ask him straight up. if he's not a little kid or anything it really shouldn't be a problem.|`|VajrBj7Saa	If you are a senior, I'd advise not to get too emotionally attached because you may be leaving him for college in the future. But if you want to ask him to prom, you should definitely go for it.
xmWxafHSaa	Don't try to turn it into more then what it is.   If things happen naturally for the two of you to move into a bf/gf relationship, then let it.  But I wouldn't push it into a relationship or fight to keep it just as friends.  Let the relationship lead itself.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Because it seems likely that you like him in a way in which you think of him as more than just a friend. Same thing here. But, it is common at our school. But our school is also nutso sometimes.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	i have the same prob?? but if you think it would be a good relationship you should talk to him about it :D|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If you value this friendship, just stay the same.  However, if you have any feelings for him, tell him (when the time is right)|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	haha omg the same thing has happened to me. my friends kept saying i liked my best guy friend, and i was like no way. and then after that i totally started liking him alot. but its awkward now, because i like him, but i don't know how he feels about me, and i feel like if we became something more it would ruin our friendship in the end. and he is my best guy friend ever. if that helps you any.|`|EdidZdtlaa	people always mistake that im going out with some of my guy friend because of the way we act to each other. but i wouldnt want to ruin my friendship with any of them to become more than friends. i just tell my other friends that no i dont like him or them and i might have to keep repeating it but eventually they get the point. i cant tell you what to do but i wouldnt push it if its not ment to be pushed you know?|`|5hM9bI1Naa	He may feel the same way about you but u should just stay best friends cause if y'all get into a boyfriend/girlfriend thing drama will happen and when y'all break up y'all my not want to be friends no more|`|iaiNBkqGaa	were in the same boat but i dont care what they think if you like him try it if it doesnt work stay friends you wont kno for sure until you find out.|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	you should thatd be chill thats what me and my gf did 16 years old been dating since 12|`|AN9PdKmgaa	the best relationships start out as friends.But before you make that jump to bf gf remember if he doesn't feel that way about you it could forever change what you have now|`|sDNrVaWSaa	i think you should wait until you are sure how you feel about him. if you keep feeling like you like him then talk to him about it. if you wanna stay friends then just do that. your friends probably think you like him cause you flirt with him but oh well. good luck :]|`|rpU209Xfaa	i know!  my bff is a guy and people think i like him just cause we talk all the time and we hang out...  i mean a guy friend is just like a girl friend...  just cause he is a guy doesn't mean that i like him or you like him...  its just a lot of crap and people just want something to talk about but they need to get a life of their own and stay out of ours!!!  i m so tired of nosey people who are low lives that need to get a life.......  and my friends need to understand that i don't like him like they think i do!  lol|`|pnVExgy6aa	My best friend is a guy. And yeah we flirt. We talk all the time. But his other friends Hate me. They think we like eachother. Everyone thinks a guy likes a girl or a girl likes a guy even if they just talk. BANG they like each other. Its just so stupid. They need to get over it. They probably just do that cause they wish they had a guy best friend. Truthfully i like my guy best friend. And i hope something does happen. .  Girls are mean!!! lolthats y girls should always have a guy bestfriend. Don't be scared to hang out with him. Just cause your friends think u like him doesn't mean u can't hang out with him. Be strong! show them that u can have a guy best friend. I hope this helps. I have the same problems|`|aRDXTWIDaa	it's up to you. you can try to take it farther, or you can just ignore it wen ppl make jokes about you guys.  your friends will get over it eventually, right now it just sounds like they're a wee bit immature.  Maybe you should ask him the same your'e asking us, maybe he secretly likes you.  It's your choice. hope this helped a lil bit. :)|`|hNW7Rbe0aa	well i think that y'all should just continues to be good best friends, because this seems like it will turn out to be one of those types of relationships, where your just like best friends, then like out of know where, your together, without actually having to ask someone out or anything, it just kinda happens..you know.. that would be so cute..    that has always been the way that i want my relationship to start..its so cute.    =]]|`|1rVGT9goaa	i think u should become more:)  you'll still also be frends& more:)|`|LOgGGuRqaa	umm they probably think u guys are going out cuz u spend a lot of time with him.....|`|lWqiZ0BNaa	because they probably don't know him. just tell them, and have him tell them also, that you are not bf and gf. i have a friend like that to, except that he lives in another state and i can onl talk to him on the phone. we talk, laugh, and figh a little (mostly "the midget argument") and we like alot of the same things.|`|Uq9Tgq3Vaa	well....if you really like him go for it but yur risking your friendship cause what if you guys breakup it may harm you friendship...but it might go the other way and if you guys do break up you may still be bffs!:)|`|hKvTI0qlaa	Be careful. Sometimes our best friend, makes our worst lover. If the two of you are happy being friends, you should let it stay that way right now. because the minute you begin sharing your feelings with each other, everything will change. So I say, enjoy life right now.... just the way it is.|`|YORoyQlPaa	haha this question got my attention.  this girl at my school was best friends with a guy and seriously, he knows EVERYTHING about her. and she is like his sister!!(i bet you he even knows her bra size, not joking). and i think they have flirted a couple of time and always seem like they are having a good time. and guess what? they ended up being a couple after a year. and they are still together now after one n a half years :) she is one of my best friends and im really happy for her! so i think you may consider that, if you really think you like him that way. but if you dont, then dont try giving him the wrong message because he may like you back and you may hurt his feeling and wnt be best buds. just take everything slow and see how it works out. i wouldnt flirt with him too much if i ddnt like him. and the second thing to do is maybe talk to him about it IF you realize that you actually kind of like him!    gd luck.xoxo|`|IQfaj1BGaa	well if you flirt with eachother it kinda means that you two like eachother    i say more|`|CtCaVVHVaa	i think you should become more,|`|hbPGe6Hxaa	ha! some one whos in same situation as me.  i have a guy best friend and i love him more than anything in the whole world, but people are convinced that i am IN LOVE with him, when i'm not, im in love with him as a best friend he means everything to me i'd jump off a cliff to make him happy, but thats because i love him to death, but people do give me alot of sht about it, like omg you love him, omg you like him blah blah, and past boyfriends have broken up with me because they thought i liked him.  There's nothing wrong with having a guy best friend, having a best friend of the opposite sex is much better i think because you'll always have things to talk about e.g: Guys things and girls things.    and to the answer to your question, you are best friends, don't ruin it by experimenting wether you should have something going on, friendship is much more important than a relationship. unless your really really sure you like him, then try something,  otherwise try not to ruin it, you'll regret it. :)|`|QYvKXqYUaa	if u really like him more than a friend and he like u more than a friend then u should  go with him.but if u only like him as a friend and he like u as a friend u should just stay best friends|`|iMqpElSNaa	He's you BEST FRIEND! who cares what they say? you deserve to be freinds or more w/ who ever you want!|`|tl1oiDbZaa	You have to do what your heart is telling you, but if it is really bugging you that badly then talk it over with him. Let's just say one of your girl friends likes to talk and she tells your guy friend (boy friend is a little to "date-like") that you may like him he may get the wrong impression. If you want to make it something more, then go for it.     I have a few guy friends myself, but they are my boyfriend's (my date) friends and I work with one of them. Also, I work at a grocery store so most of my co-workers are really cute guys about my age so I get teased a lot. Anyway, sorry about that, sometimes I get asked if I am going out with/like the guys from work.     As I said before, just talk it over with your guy friend. If you want to make it something more go for it, but be warned that going out and if you two break up can destroy the friendship so I would think carefully and discuss it with him. If you don't want to go out with him, then I'd tell your friends that you two are just friends.|`|6BVKaacTaa	friendship is the most important thing you could ever have.  if youre not positive you have more feelings for him, don't tell him you do. Trust me, you don't want to loose a best friend especially if youre not even sure you like him. So wait a little longer, and if you're feelings grow for him, then let him know.|`|ZN12wK9iaa	You know what, as a matter of fact, there are rumors going on right now about me and my guy friend. Just because we always talk doesn't mean you guys are dating..personally I think that guys do not carry ANY kind of drama with them but at the same time ignore anybody who tries to say that you like him because you know what?? They're not in your heart so they cant tell you how to feel! They are not in your heart so the least you can do is just ignore them. And if you guys do go further, just remember this, if you guys ever break up, it's never going to be the same. So just remeber what I said and ignore them!|`|FU3n5CSBaa	Friend first - then lovers. A recipe for success.|`|JSCxJynpaa	if you don't like him... why do you flirt with him?|`|BWgV2xSZaa	If you dont like him or anything then you shouldnt create a relationship with him. The theory still stands that friends of opposite genders cannot be friends for long.|`|9GfGRIGDaa	take some time and figure out if ur feelings for him are true, also think about whether he will like u back, and if this will screw up ur friendship|`|8MS22doEaa	omg i have the same issue. My guy friend  is like a brother and is always there for me and we talk about everything together. Everyone thinks we like each other and i was wondering the same thing. turns out he did like me. He asked me out and we seem to be going really good. You should try going out with him if he asks you. You get nervous and shy at first because you think about what other people will say but don't mind them. your choice|`|FxpE8ivMaa	guys an girls can't "just be friends" without having some attraction to one another sooner or later. its true, and if you dont believe me, well then you're gonna find out for yourself. they could be the most hideous thing to walk the earth. it doesnt matter.|`|H4f2dXVLaa	Going further can ruin a friendship.|`|qso2kC89aa	Go for it. Tell him how you really feel.|`|yt4DyhPOaa	do whatever you feel comfortable with! staying friends is great. going out could ruin EVERYTHING you have though.    EXAMPLE: i went out with my best guy friend earlier this year. he was so sweet, he was my bestfriend and i didnt want us to even be well, not friends! then we went out, and broke up. he hasnt looked at me since. ive basically lost one of my closest friends and i have to deal with it every single day     but do what you want.|`|M7rH2QWEaa	Drop some hints first, find out if he likes you.  Ask what kind of girls he likes, etc.I had this same situation recently and it blew up in my face big time.  She's no longer my friend and we haven't talked since.  Sucks cause she was the best friend I've ever had - and I fell for her - thus, the problem.
Pn99lZ73aa	shes not being controling.  idc if its my life.  my bestfriend IS my life.  she knows whats best for me, she wants me happy  and i keep letting her down.  idc if i wasnt supposed to answer.  dont give up, dont stop being my friend.  ik i was happy, and i let him ruin it.  dont worry. ill fix it.   i promise.  i do need a friend right now.  UK what im going through.  you understand better than anyone.  ik u want him out of my life.  i do too.  he keeps guilting me. and wont let me be happy.        ill have it fixed by tonight.  please dont leave me.      PEOPLE TELL HER NOT TO LEAVE ME =(|`|PBe2qbXNaa	she needs a friend right now.....just talk to her more....time will heal|`|esJpBtEdaa	givve uppp|`|MhvwRwNKaa	Let her make her own mistakes. And if she continues to ignore you then dump her as well. You don't need to be treated like that. Your just being a good friend.|`|P68rfGiyaa	okay i have a friend whos ignoring me cause of her bf i think you should tell her how you feel and if she dont liten dont talk to her and wait to see what she does but you have to understand that it is her life with her boyfriend and even though your her best friend she dosnt HAVE to listen to you|`|f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	Sounds like you two are having some issues.  First off, if she wants to date this guy, that's her choice; let her.  If you want to point out some of the things you've noticed about him that you don't like, then do it, but make sure its true and there is proof to back it up. Don't bug her about it though. No girl is going to ditch her boyfriend just because her best friend doesn't like him.    On the subject of her not telling you things, maybe there is a reason, like the fact she knows you don't like her ex.  Just talk to her about it. That's the best thing to do. Don't get all up in her face, just talk to her about wha'ts bothering you.    (:|`|CrjU3eWYaa	Maybe give a little bit of space. And try just ignoreing that ex. Its her life, let her deal with that. Only give your advice when its wanted.|`|KWl605JTaa	no. i honestly think your over-reacting. it was right of you to help your friend get rid of her ex. but i think it's time to give her a little bit of space. that doesn't mean stop being her friend, she probably needs a good friend.|`|ordtRfOvaa	I have the same problem. you cant help someone if they don't want to help themselves. It took me a while and a backstabbing friend moving into my house to understand it. shes not worth your time and effort i know it may sound mean but if she wont heed your warning do you honestly think she truly ever listened to you in the first place|`|AA10394452	Look, you're being too controlling over your friend. Let her do as she wishes and you do as you wish. Maybe she hates your bf or some other friend or family member but puts up with it because she loves you.|`|VMxqr5iWaa	Don't give up on her! This has happened to me before and I was going to give up also. You just have to be there for her support and a shoulder to cry on when she needs it. I know how hard it is to sit and there and watch your friend get treated like **** but, you have tried what all you can do. So just be there for her if she is really your best friend you wont walk away from her.|`|pg5r8kuxaa	well obviously she might not want u mad so shes avoiding the whole thing  don't dump her as a friend because of a guy that's silly  if she was ur true best friend u wouldn't even think of that  listen i know its hard to put up with him but its not like he will be there forever... and u 2 possibly could be don't let some guy ruin ur friendship.  there is  nothing u can really do to make her see what u see about this guy if he really is that bad in time things between them will fall apart and ull still have ur friend and he will be alone.|`|83a3dgKmaa	Maybe.she doesn't realize what she's doing just give her some time obviously she she's mad. you just need to stay out of her hair and her ex's, lay off for a little your being to controlling, it's not really your buissness. Just go hang out with your other friends and when she realizes how mean her ex is to her she'll be back to you and everything will be normal, just don't give up on her, it's what a friend should do.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Unfortunately, you can give all the advice you want, but it is worth nothing if friends decide not to take it.  They do not have to take the advice.  It is a matter of choice.    Friendship, too, is a matter of choice.  You have to be aware of what you can tolerate and what you cannot.  Do you still love your friend, no matter who her bf is?  Do you still want to spend time with her and be supportive even when you don't agree with her decisions?      The more pressure you put on her to leave the bf, the more she is going to cling to him.  He is already possessive and controlling and you are acting just like he is.  Do what I say....or else.    When you talk to her like that, it makes it easier for her to go back with him because she perceives that you are both talking to her in the same manner, even though it is entirely different.  You are speaking from a loving, caring place, and he is not.  (At least, this is your opinion.)    Being her friend is going to mean keeping your mouth shut and smiling a lot when she talks about bf.      You have choices to make about your friendship.  Leave it, go back to it, or change it.  Changing it might mean that you are not there every minute to listen to her when she calls and complains.  You might try changing the subject when she complains about the bf's behavior.  You might try spending some time with other friends and making an agreement that when you are with her that you don't talk about the guys.      This is a tough position to be in.  Just think the situation through before making your decision.  Good luck.|`|SLfA0BBlaa	friends are for life.    just be there.    talk to her before she does something stupid.|`|RsXUjuUMaa	you need toooooooooo decide  coz its easy for us to say but only u will know whats right coz we dont know the exact sitiation and how deep freinds u r only u wud kno da answer good luckkkk
zyKQPLqQaa	I think a better question is - are you healthy and are you happy. Your weight depends on your bone structure. You may be small-boned.  If you're super active, bike and swim you seem to have enough energy.  If you're eating protein, vegetables and fruits (not just junk food or fast food) and exercising you should be healthy. Have you had a physical lately? If you're in good health I wouldn't worry about being too skinny. Many models were very skinny when they were young and now they're making the big bucks. The best revenge is living well.    I don't think people should eat more or less to please other people. They will criticize for almost any reason or no reason. I remember when I lost weight after my daughter was born.  People kept telling me "don't loose too much."  I think they just didn't want me to be thinner than they were. Thank you criticizers for sharing and ignore them. Be happy with yourself as you are.|`|9CCtt077aa	Yeah, you are underweight. Doesn't sound pretty. Sorry.|`|ex5hVYKxaa	Your not TOO skinny but yes you are skinny. I have a Friend who's 4 months older than me and is 11 and weighs like 59 lbs maybe 60. Shes like you. not too skinny like anorexic but skinny.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	oh. my. god. i'm 5'4, and i'm... 30 pounds heavier, and everyone tells me i'm the "ideal weight" and i've never felt fat in my life.|`|7B0qFbWBaa	92 lbs is a little light for a 15 year old|`|W50zzBQoaa	gain some weight. thats obvious you didnt even need to put this on here. the average size for a healthy girl of 5"3 is like 120 pounds or somthing like that not under 100. trust me.    unlesssssssss you have a really smalll bnody structure. like if your not big boned.     but gain a little weight. yourboobs will get bigger and you'll get some more curves. ;]|`|kW371HVMaa	yeah ur skinny better start eatin some protein and get some boobs! im 13 and i have bigger ones than u!|`|Tf19RETiaa	yea thats rather thin, but if your really active then its no big deal.  im 5'3 too|`|VjmTK6uZaa	WOw hun you need to eat some candy|`|PxfFBsMQaa	holy, **** yeah your too skinny. THATS NOT HEALTHY!|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	wtf 41kg! yes thats too skinny.|`|eHrvVMZjaa	Your pretty normal|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'd need to see a picture to really judge, but from the sound of it, I think it wouldn't hurt you to gain a little weight.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well if your 5'3 and weight 92 pounds then that alone says your too skinny. You know that you didn't have to look for opinions? Just search "BMI" on google which is your body mass index, that would have told you that your way underweight. Your BMI is 16.3... a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, anything below 18.5 is considered under weight. It's not really about honesty though lol..it's a fact that you are underweight. hope that helped.|`|C90bta8Saa	your 15 and sound healthy!|`|zhrGiQsKaa	92lbs? your a stick, put some meat on your bones at least 10lbs. I am not trying to be mean, i just am being honest.|`|vKDwaqPraa	nope thats actually pretty good. my friend its like 5 feet and weighs about 86 pounds.|`|AA10447831	You could gain 10   and be fine and a bit curvier too|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	NO UR NOT 2 SKINNY.

You're suppose to be around 110-120|`|Uxdiv3fdaa	You are so f-ing skinny. Eat otherwise you'll be anorexic (sounds like you already are)    EAT SOME RICE KRISPIE TREATS  THEY ARE SO GOOD  also drink Arizona Iced Tea    Its so good. Also something smothered in chocolate. Like strawberries.  Stop hanging out with other anorexic friends. Hang out with fat girls until you are a proper weight then ditch those mofos.|`|oL6roNSUaa	as long as your healthy why does it matter? im skinny but i dont let it get to me, many people literally kill themselves to be thin.|`|i9ST2JBwaa	i'm 16   5'2"  32 full b  24 waist  93 lbs    you're basically the same as me.  you probably look super skinny because you're flat chested.  in my case i don't look as thin as i am.|`|8te6mUHIaa	umm . yer bmi is way underweight  but its okay . its good to look skinny x;|`|pbPe614Raa	your just active.it probably just runs in your family,but u should be greatful to be petite,cause thats whats you are.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	gross, 92 pounds?  most guys like meat  fatten up! :D|`|rNdun1V7aa	yes and you know your skinny so shut up about it.|`|twL8cs4uaa	Does it matter...if your happy with YOUR body then thats all that matters.|`|ORaAPCrsaa	not really :)|`|8xPWd35maa	I understand you're active and I think that all that's important is that you are happy with yourself.   If you were to gain weight, you'd probably become a little curvier, which would probably not be a bad thing.  Either way, if it's a problem, I'm sure your parents or a guidance counselor would do something.  Don't worry.|`|STB7HLZ6aa	you're fat.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	skinny not tooo skinny|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	long story short two points|`|47LJn3dzaa	Yup...better put on a few.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	no. your fine!|`|JHe0kJdgaa	im a guy and you sound normal|`|G3emC90haa	my god.  i love jesus's comment.|`|JiLhX0Jiaa	92 is pretty small....but idk if i could say it's "too skinny" or not.|`|PwnRqFP3aa	yes, 92 lbs is a bit underweight for a 15 year old, even on a small frame|`|aiBzKyjlaa	as long as you eating well you'll be fine|`|LlMS9NsSaa	Nope.|`|ZswFuTBRaa	kinda. eat more|`|pkUGWcevaa	maybe a little. try a couple fried tweenkies|`|gjDcdTcDaa	Skinny! im 32 a and 12 and a weigh about 98 !|`|uvzuk10Eaa	pretty sure of yourself why do you need other ppl to tell you what you look like have a look in the mirror and if your worryd about it see a doctor|`|XP36zr63aa	its skinny, but more like healthy skinny, not anorexic.|`|0KVbh5Qqaa	wtf....get some meat on yourself man...  nobody wants to date a skeleton|`|2F9EcT7Haa	you're fine.|`|xwjKz3oEaa	i think your small but it really depends on your build chances are you'll grow more but yea you are a tand on the skinny side|`|k3Ijyqu5aa	your ok but it wouldnt hurt to gain some weight|`|lFlPWFwYaa	uhmm i would say just to u kno b hotter for the guys u should REALLY put on about 10 or 15 pounds  dont worry itll all go to yer boobs|`|4CINI0fsaa	you are very skinny but dont try to put on a few pounds try to gain muscle instead to stay fit|`|eSoU2C3Waa	that's close to me except i'm 5' 4'' and weigh 112, i would say nope your perfect the way you are.|`|xSlS9Ad1aa	No you aren't it would matter how much u eat so if u dont eat alot like not anything or something like that it would matter but if u eat good and healty then your good|`|7kfCH85naa	you're perfectly fine.its MUCH better to be overweight rather than underweight(which you definitely aren't!)so dont worry,when you come back for a class reunion in 20 years everyone will have gained 60 pounds except for you.|`|jGzIMKF3aa	no your fine i'm 5'5 and 100 so you should be good|`|CZ3LE4yhaa	Your really thin and I think you should gain weight. I have the same issue as you are I'm 95 pounds 5'3 and 17 years old lol. You should go to your doctor to see if your eating right and getting enough protein, Sugar, ect... I did and they said that I was all fine but maybe for you, your missing something? The weight number isn't really that important, its wither or not your eating right amounts of food each day.|`|OYcB4rvraa	Yeha a little skinny|`|UE0mKPSUaa	um, acutlly i think you are okay. im only 71 pounds and im 13. im really skinney too. its so annoying isnt it? everyone always says "oh you'll get there" blah blah blah.   but no, i think you are good. :)|`|WSV0kjERaa	Technically you are underweight. Your BMI is 16.3 and anything below 18.5 is considered underweight. Ask your doctor if there is any type of protein bar or somethin that will help you gain a little weight.

sEzrs3Uyaa	Deffinately love.  Its amazing what you can do with little or no money.  Then years down the road when you have money you can remenise about what you will then call the good old days and you will remember how you got to where you are now.  You will never truley appreciate the good times unless you have a few bumps in the road.|`|QZrpywcraa	love because its the closest thing we have to magic. its so hard to explain the feeling but once you experience it,its worth more than all the money in the world. to find the one that was made for you.|`|ymMa6Pmiaa	Money can't buy happiness and true love.|`|BvuSJNO3aa	love for me too. who needs money if you have no one to share it with i rather be happy and know it won't run out one day:D|`|838VJJGvaa	Lovez.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Definitely love because money doesn't buy happiness.|`|EdidZdtlaa	love all the way|`|aRDXTWIDaa	LOVE!!! every time :)|`|BWgV2xSZaa	In the words of The Beatles: "Cant buy me looooove, everybody tells me so, cant buy me looooove, no no no nooooo!"|`|wFWytGlxaa	Money.    I'm a very independent person. If I don't find love, it really isn't a bother to me. Money will buy financial security, make sure you will not be in the poor house working dead end jobs 'till the day you die. Look at the economy for instance.    Just my 2 cents!|`|DCcrLTcZaa	Love definetly|`|PCpC4iS1aa	money money money money money brings happiness|`|22XoBiZ3aa	LOVE...OR IF GOT MONEY, YOU CAN ALWAYS BUY A HOOKER...HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE "PRETTY WOMAN"?|`|iWnxwVMMaa	no  question about it..LOVE!! i dont care about money..sure its nice and well you do need it..but love is the true and cant be bought..|`|f150f01d84493e10842994ccc28e9d6eaa	Love love love love.

"and also"  it's easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle then it is for a rich man to get in the gates of heaven
aRDXTWIDaa	that's a problem even i have trouble with, though it's common knowledge that everyone has a little rythem.  You can just sway or bounce to the beat and it won't matter to your date or friends cuz at prom everyone's so happy so noone's going to give a **** aboout your dancing and ppl will laugh with you about it afterward.  what ever happen's it's all right, dancing's overrated anyway ;)|`|2thQbeAYaa	usually at proms you freak dance, which is also known as twerking, grinding, etc. lots of kids in high school know it, and it's a very sexually provacative way of dancing. for guys, just put your hands on the girls's hips as she sways her hips in front of you, putting her butt to your crotch...yeah.    dancing is all about self-expression. just dance how you think it should be done, don't give a d amn about others's opinions!|`|FG4hKNUyaa	ok who cares if u can dance (most guys cnt) if u act confident nd act like u dont care then otha ppl wont care either... so dont go insane wit crazy moves but just dance regular nd u will b fine trust me ( i learned this from experience nd if someone says somethin act like u dont care just laugh at urself lol)|`|ZswFuTBRaa	just slow dance with girls. thats cool. all you have to do is move back and forth...|`|cdXMQai8aa	Guys that dance... thats just weaird, to me anyways.|`|yC4REA3waa	do what feels natural you just need to let loose
fHGuhjM4aa	well if you guys talk or whatever try to let him know your intrestead by smiling and trying to catch his eye, but when you smile do it with an i like you kinda thing...  and long distant relationships can work, my sister has a boyfriend who lives in England and they still manage to make it work, hes coming back down here in April i think...  hope this helps :)|`|QYvKXqYUaa	ask him if he like any girls if he say no tell him that u like him nd if he want to go with u.if he say yes tell him that i really like u!|`|mzIfJIQVaa	well that happened to me and it is really just best to move on because long distance relationships are the most complicated things in the world|`|kW371HVMaa	text/IM|`|JHe0kJdgaa	how r u suposed to talk 2 him|`|1hinQlz2aa	send hate mail to him and in the end mark you name as    Love  -(your name here)
CA9OFT4Waa	he wants to take back his statement about not liking you, good luck!|`|oYF3nIbsaa	Ok well please don't get excited because it might not happen but he is probably going to ask you out and give you a little kiss! Ohemgee i dont even know you but im excited for you! I was so excited when my boyfriend asked me out. But just remember|`|m6xvhlJqaa	hes goijg to ask you out!!!|`|uFJXz1x3aa	hes probably gonna ask you out and give u a kiss or something, but be careful not to get your hopes up.. cuz if it dosent happen, youll be crushed :[|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	maybe he wants to give you a hug and then ask you out ?|`|AA10913583	he wants to ask you out|`|JHe0kJdgaa	hes asking you out duhhhhhhhh|`|4CINI0fsaa	hes going to ask you out for sure but act suprised lol|`|AN9PdKmgaa	he just wants a booty call forget him he doesn't like you just what he thinks you will give him|`|hKvTI0qlaa	I think he wants to share with you how we really feel about you. If he has the GALLS to tell you he doesnt like you, that means he doesnt have a problem telling you how he really feel. Besides, when you chose to still remain his friend after tell you think he doesnt like you, that showed him that you are not so emotional and are a strong person. That is what guys are looking for.
oVtvjSVJaa	When she says she's not the one to mess with, you should say "then do somethin' then since your so high and mighty, do it!" and say it with attitude. She says she's tough but it might all be just talk. Or you could say "well what are YOU gonna do?" You need to stick up for yourself.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	err that's not bullying...i think you got the concept wrong.  ignore that bunch of people and stop trying to create tension between you by talkin with just your friends and not talking AND looking at them. You're only looking for troubles by doing that|`|Q6akazbZaa	stick up for yourself, and try talking to them to squash it, because really its not worth getting kick out of school, or getting into a huge scary fight, just try to talk to them about the whole thing and let it go,
kFEx2Bx0aa	Straight up. Tell them you're tired of lying and that they should not be weirded out by you.  Your the same person you've always been!  If you're not into any of them tell them, but don't make it seem like they're not good enough for you... And tell them weather or not you want this to be public knowledge:) Good Luck|`|Rr0ph7zTaa	Look, it's simple. If you're so sick of them always asking what guys you're into and all that stuff, then you'd tell them! I know it's a very scary thing but it will lift so much weight of your shoulders. You wont have to hide who you are, you won't have to listen to them ask about guys anymore... And if you are afraid they may judge you, make fun of you- or anything like that, they aren't your true friends. Maybe, sit down your closest friend and just let it all out. Hope this helped.|`|qW7aSBI2aa	Clearly your too young or immature to really even know anything. I've got a feeling that this "Lesbianism" is really just you, acting out against daddy and mommy for not giving you that new sports car or the diamond necklace, as are most cases.|`|B9Jn2YGhaa	i think you should tell them altogether in your group i have seen that if you only tell one person then all the other girls eventually find out and it willl be  awkard tell them that you have something serious to tell them and that  to be really calm and that you need them to be understanding|`|xFJk2QO1aa	Uh im not really sure because im in to guys but i would say to first asure them your just friends and them give them clues and if they figure it out ask them if they would please axept you for the way you are.|`|3Y7RJu3taa	If I were you, I'd wait until the next time they ask you about what guy you like, and then say something like "I'm actually not sure I'm into guys." see how they react.  I'd be careful because even if you are really close with your friends, this topic could get awkward.  If this information is no big deal to them, you know they're good friends, but if it is, it doesn't neccessarily mean they're bad friends, its just a difficult thing for them to understand, and it may take time.  Good Luck!|`|tS2BpqTiaa	ask them if they have ever felt what you feel  and tell them that you don't want them to freak out because you don't like them(hopefully). and then just spill the beans and tell them that you prefer girls, or that you go both ways.  if they are your true friends then they won't care.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Just hang out with your girl friends and make no announcement in high school. Save this for college. If you announce that you feel you are a lesbian, most time high school girls aren't prepared mentally to handle it. You may find yourself with no friends because they will be afraid to be hanging out with a lesbian and be labeled the same. Just wait until college to make your announcement.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Well if you want to bring major attention, possible gossip begining in school, less friends is possible too, being taunghted, then go ahead and say something. If it sounds better to have friends and be spared the gossip etc then put up with the occassional question about guys. If it was me, I never had to tell anyone my choice to be heterosexual, so I really do not understand why people feel they need to make some announcement and alter their live in their social life, and then get to hear them complain that their friends are losers etc and be alone at home. The ifs and whens and whats, is what starts the begining of needing alot of therapy in the gay community. The loss of privacy, the start of possible problems with friends and family, get to be too much. Once you say it, you have to live with the problems. Or you can keep your personal feelings to yourself and occasionally think about tellign people and get through that and continue on.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Just come out and say it.  So many girls are bi or lez nowadays that it's getting old.|`|qZcd1OjNaa	If they really were yourr friend  they wouldnt mind it, im bi and told my friends. they accept me, only real friends do that. dont be ashamed, i was but it wasnt a big deal, oh and dont tell your parents. hoped this helped :)|`|ZgNPIlWFaa	omg i have sort of the same delima. I am bi. I love guys but girls are fun too. I haven't told my close friends yet i am too scared. So if you get any good advice please let me know. thanks..|`|1ZT39UkWaa	just come out with it. if your nervous tell your closest friend and ask her//him how they feel about it, and how you should tell the rest.  a while ago one of my close mates came out  it was a bit of a shock to the girls lik but we made a joke about it and now we regularly hang out with her and her gf- who are amazing ppl    if they really care about you, the'll support you. they might be a bit shocked but this is normal  don't worry!    good luck!|`|vLJKNkNLaa	http://gaylife.about.com/od/comingout/ss...|`|dXtzLcIwaa	....................?|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Just come ot and tel them.  If they are really your friends they will understand and be supportive.  If they start acting different towards you then you know it's time to get new friends with the same interests.  Do not be ashamed of who you are.  Be true to yourself first and foremost otherwise you will be false to everyone else.  Good Luck!|`|t8gHU5Glaa	Ask what they would do if you were gay. If they say anything bad then tell them anyways. But, after they answer just be like 'Well, I am'.

I was in the same situation before & it turned out that 4 girls in my group had actually been with women before. They didn't take it seriously at all. Just, one night when you're out, bring it up. If they're down to earth people they wont think anything of it. |`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	Keep in mind, you may lose of friends over this. Ive been there and done that. They might not feel as great as you will getting this off you chest.     Be honest, and upfront. Decide if you want to tell them as a group or 1 at a time. But if you tell them 1 at a time, the phone tree will happen. I hope it all goes well and would love to hear the end result.     Good luck.|`|9VhR1XwOaa	Any true friend will accept you for who you are.  Simply sit them down and explain to them how you are feeling.  You'll be a bit more comfortable once the truth is out there.  They may not know how to respond at first, but if they're your real friends, then they'll let you know that you're all still friends no matter what and that it doesn't bother them.  They should love you all the same hun.  Don't hide who you are.  Best of luck :)|`|0Snb72lvaa	yea it is getting old it use to be surprising now a days it's not even that important anymore|`|ONZ4QhDIaa	Just tell eh! If they're real friends the'll still like you.|`|wJXUb1y1aa	Drop them hints to say that you aren't into guys before just flat out saying it. See how they react and if you are comfortable with the reaction, just come out and say it. If they are your friends they should accept you for who you are.    Good luck :)|`|9lluYdSVaa	next time they ask u who ur into just tell them that u like girls more and they just need to shut up|`|a8xY9rRgaa	You just need to come out and say it slowly so they understand and if they really your friends they will accept you. So Good Luck.
AA10975867	Uh, your new guy named Dan is NOT the "perfect gentleman" or else he would not be so low class as to date an engaged woman - especially someone who is engaged to a guy who is risking his life to protect scumbags like "Dan".  Favorite book characters with impeccable manners usually resemble men of the "Elton John persuasion" anyway! Get your head out of the clouds, go and see his family, confess what you've done, beg their forgiveness and ask them to softly convey the message to him. At least THEIR LOVE is true! Poor guy. Better he finds out now though instead of marrying you and then having you cheat.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Wait until your fiancee gets home and break things off then.    Keep your romance with "Dan the GentleMAN" quiet so word doesn't get back to your finacee about it.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Noone can help you, thats your decision to make. Either way you have to admit you cheated, that might settle the deal for you and your fiancee, plus a real gentleman doesn't start a relationship with someone who is engaged or in anotehr relationship, sorry.|`|6L9jJnchaa	You need some serious help.

Your mom works her butt off for you, and all you can think of, is how embarrassing it is for you?

That's what intelligent people do.  Be grateful she wants to take care of you and provide for you.
nZXJrAAjaa	I just read an article about child custody and some tips on how to win your child. It states there;     Child Custody laws describe the responsibility of guardianship over a child. In cases of divorce where children are involved, a court must rule on a child custodial arrangement as one of the terms of the divorce. Divorcing parents are free to reach agreement on an acceptable custody arrangement, however, in the minority of cases where parents dispute some aspect of the custody arrangements, the court will examine the family, the child, and the qualities or misdemeanors of either parent, before delivering a legally binding judgment intended to put the well-being of the child first. It is usually far preferable to reach a settlement outside of court, putting less strain on affected children, and being cheaper for the parents to avoid litigation.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It might, it depends if he has been the one caring for her and how she's doing under his care.  Shared custody is always best.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Probation for a class C? That's saying you got a speeding ticket and the judge put you on probation. Seems like dad isn't the only one lying...    Yes it can hurt your case. Where's your proof that Dad is incapable of caring for an infant? Do you have hard evidence that he does not know how to change a diaper, feed a bottle, burp, play with, comfort, put to sleep, and many of the other things entailed in parenting an infant other than your word?    If you do not have this evidence, your claims are baseless and moot in a court of law. If your being on probation is for a drug or other serious offense, why would a judge place a child in your custody to raise and you can't get your own life straight?    Please answer my questions.

Safe area for the reason of safety you never know how he might react.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You go with Bob.

Also, to spare his feelings, you could lie and tell Bob that this Gary did something suuuper nice for you or your family & so you kinda "have to" go with him to the prom.

Seriously though don't ditch a anybody at a dance espeacially prom!
GqhtePhgaa	Maybe you should just try smiling in an all-knowing, wry manner, chuckling softly to yourself, shaking your head subtly and confidently and then walking away.  That will drive them crazy.  If they persist and actually chase you (stupid fools), turn quickly with a shot to the adam's apple.  That will shut them up and make them think for a long time to come.
6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	I am very sorry to hear of your stressful situation. That is a terrible situation you and your brother are living under. I do not know what age you can go to Family Court in your state/district/county and file  a report against your father and his abuse. You CAN also go or CALL :Child Protective Services (CPS) and file a report in your county. It will be investigated and appropriate measures will be taken. Nobody should live in those conditions...no one! Is your father a substance abuser?  You all need counseling, too, including  your mother. She should not allow your father to treat you as such, either.   Please get help asap...call Child Protective Services tomorrow. Be strong and remember you are doing the right thing, believe me.   May God bless you and your brother.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You are 17 and soon you will be out of the house. Make sure your grades are good and plan to leave for college. Everyone comes from some kind of dysfunctional family. You only make it a big deal if you let it. I think you should consider that probably your Dad was more of a sperm donor than a Dad. My guess is this is the way he was treated and has no idea what he's doing is wrong. Make sure you don't repeat this by treating your kids the way you were treated or finding a man as abusive as your Dad to marry either.|`|4KOuL7mZaa	i'd go with theropy or jus tsit down and talk to him about it.|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	my dad is very annoying, i can understand what you have to go through. be strong, your father is so wrong|`|KWl605JTaa	you need to set you and your brother up for therapy.  if your brother doesn't notice, he'll act how your father is when he is older.  i don't know much about this, but my best advice is therapy. not that your bad, just so you and your brother can know someone is there for you. because there is.  i hope the best for you. really.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	It is possible that your parents are abusive and/or neglectful.    However, when one has OCD and/or GAD, it is common to over react and misinterpret.    I suggest you discuss these problems with your therapist.  If you don't have one, seek help from the physician who prescribed medications for your disorders.|`|un8qNuQNaa	Talk to a counselor or something.  Get him help, that is just horrible.  He is so totally abusing you guys verbally and it's probably cause of his parents.|`|6J2NqXX0aa	your father should not be treating you like this at all. if i were you, i would go to a guidance counselor, maybe attend a group that other kids join/attend, because their family relationship.......maybe you and your brother can join a group for kids like you, who have a family relationship, like this, and maybe you can discuss it, with them. maybe you can feel better that way, or make your father attend some of these "parent counselors groups" and maybe your father can get some tips, and maybe that will help. i would if i were you, talk to a guidance counselor,  its probably the best way to go, and attending groups-meetings, that has like i said, earlier, other kids like you, and you can discuss your family relationship if you want, and they can help you out. maybe give you some tips.,.etc.

2afVnStxaa	Dude, you cheated on her WHILE you were with her, so what is the big deal that she is having sex with a guy after you and she were broke up. First she wants you, so the sex she is getting now must be lacking somehow, or she wouldn't want you back in the first place. Get over yourself, and stop having a double standard. If you want to be back with her then take her back, if not then don't, but don't make it about her having sex with someone else because you did it while you were with her which caused the problems in the first place. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.|`|Ak6HLE5oaa	ohkmi wud not get bak wit her!! u ssound like u deserve better than that!! find sumone who will do u better!! she sounds nasty anyways!! u deserve better and there are better out there!! gud luck!|`|VBrE8tO9aa	If you dont feel anything for her I would'nt bother getting with her again, and also if she just broke up 2.5 weeks ago and she's already gotten with another guy physically it doesnt really seem like she was into you that much. Unless you just want to mess with her which would be really messed up.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Be her friend for now on.  Comfort her.|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	you cheated on her? LOSER! GTFO!|`|g74UgST7aa	no... move on = the healthy response    Yes take her back and have her do all your darkest fantasies.  Make her crawl on her belly like a reptile and be your sex slave.  No one says that you're going to get married, right?  = another healthy response ( & one I have chosen in the past)|`|uFJXz1x3aa	wowww dude i would say go back to her, but then i think you shouldnt because she might be doing the guy behind your back if you get back with her...sooo i dont think you should
skZcJ3k3aa	That sounds like what shes saying. She might have had a little mix up and knew that you were a person she could talk to in her time of need. I guess you just dont realize what you have until they are gone :[ Thats what happened with me and my oyfriend but we got back together [now] and I couldnt be more happier. We finally realized how much we wanted to be with each other. But for your situation its MAJOR points when a girl can trust and confide in you. Thats some major props right there and thats a good chance that she wants you back. A girl always wants someone she can talk too.|`|SXh0FDHzaa	dont fall for it.      she really doesnt know exactly what she wants.  but if she really want you..youll know in time  until then try to get your mind of her by occuping urself with other things.|`|hKvTI0qlaa	Some will probably say, leave her alone, that she doesnt deserve you. I say, she has the right to choose who she wants to be with. And sometimes this means getting with someone else in order to find out that the person we left, is our soul mate. And another thing, it's hard coming back to the person you left for someone else. If she found the NERVE to come back and say what she said, you should probably listen to her.     Now, I'm not telling you to be a fool. You cant just walk off and hurt a person and then think you can just come back like she did. It's alright to miss her, but I would give her some more time to think about what she really wants. You cant keep getting in the line of fire. This means, dont run back to her. She left you, let her do all the work right now. Besides, she is the one trying to discover where she belongs.|`|EntUO9vRaa	don't talk 2 her and look at her or anything keep ur mind on other things like games and other stuff watch she will come back 2 u|`|DFw8TSmMaa	I'm in a similar situation. In your case however, I think she might be leaning on you for emotional support after having problems with her new boyfriend. And it's good that you didnt talk to her, that was perfect.     What I suggest is wait for her to ask you to meet up or something like that. And when you guys talk you can feel her out and see what exactly she wants from you. Let her dictate the conversation and follow her lead.     Don't bring up your guys past. Let her do that. When her true intentions come out, and you'll know when they do, then you can go on from there. If she's talking about her new bf that may be a bad sign because it signals she wants YOUR help to fix things with HIM, which is obviously not what you want.    Most importanty: Don't let her know you want her back so badly!!! Remember, she contacted YOU.|`|zpp9FDjIaa	she obviously is bored with her current boyfriend. you need to tell her to choose between the two of you. after you tell her that, stop talking to her and looking at her. keep your mind focused on other things, like schoolwork.|`|7260c9120059c7fb296cfba63b174bb1aa	give her another chance, maybe u guys should get 2gether again cuz it sounds like ur still not over each other. if u break up this time then itll b waaay easier 2 get over her n if u dont, well im happy 4 u then =) lol|`|49f6cbd2686a9cc3b76dbadb4c520e99aa	maybe she is confused about who she wants to be with. And i think by talking to you it will get her to know that she likes you because i know that if i was talking to an ex and i had a boyfriend i  would kinda want the ex back if i wrote a txt like that to him. so i would think she either wants to give you another chance and see how it works. Or maybe she did get into a fight who knows. Just think did she do that to you when you guys where together to one of her other ex's? If so if that happened then maybe it was out of anger but who knows her as well as you. You can answer that question for yourself. Good luck i wish you the best.|`|IAUDaQx9aa	the only thing i can tell u is that if she's is still in love with you and if you do really love her, i'm not talking about some lingerie feelings, you should try to get her back. love is about forgiveness after all.  hope this will help|`|CL1a2AXKaa	Hmmm not sure what you can really do in this situation.|`|N3U7xWAPaa	she probly finds comfort in you and you are most likely a very good friend of hers . she wants to have your opionon on  your thoughts of her. she may have been a little confused about this new boy  since she was dating you for one year . she justt wants try and be with other ppl , too help get her mind off u most  likely it will all depend on how fast she got together with this new person they  might of gotten in a fight but most lkely she just is confused about her feelings just like you ! . as for time .. i was in the same sit with my Ex. but i learned finally that we cant make someone want us but at the same time its hard to control your own feelings . and dont shut her out , unless you want her out . keep being a good friend . and hang out with your budds or go see a movie . or go to a dance hopefully that will keep your mind of her .     gooood luckkk ,|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	maybe she doesn't know what she wants and she knows that it was a mistake to break up with you she wants to get back together.|`|qLJnCj0Naa	She doesn't know if she still wants you or her new bf!  Tell her to make up her mind! otherwise shes just playing with the both of  you!
zpp9FDjIaa	confront him.|`|kW371HVMaa	confront! capricorns like to pick at you! im a libra too and we just like to even out the peace. confront and he will stop|`|IQfaj1BGaa	what does their sign have to do with it?
66jX06Onaa	You sound like you have integrity and good character, and that is a huge turn on to a woman looking for a serious relationship. If you stick with your plan, you will have a better chance to find a woman worth marrying.     Once we get physical in a relationship it's difficult to see the flaws in the other person. If you plan to marry and have a family, you need to see that a woman also has good character and integrity, and that you work well together.     I would go even one step further - don't be intimate with a woman until you find out from an older, wise and respected woman (like your mom or aunt) what they think of her. If they see serious flaws, don't get any closer to her! Women 'read' women, and men 'read' men much more clearly than a man can read a woman and vise versa.    As for experience in sex, it's really overrated. You can read a book on methods of intimacy or watch a movie and learn more. A good woman wants a man who cares about her, shows affection and takes good care to keep the relationship fun and fresh. The sex is something fun you can learn together, because it's going to be different from person to person. What you experience together won't ever be the same as what she has experienced (or you have experienced) with anyone else.|`|5lblfKCcaa	personally i prefer going out w/ virgins cuz i know i wont get used  i'm in no way a virgin but being in a long stable relationship b4 doing any thing is important to me as well & should be important to other people & if any girl doesnt want you becuz of that then trust me your better off w/ out them cuz they've got some messed up values  dont worry you'll find the right person & when you do it will be great|`|7Xx8VERWaa	Id find that not a turn off..

Its cool that your choosing to wait :)|`|lEignX9Vaa	20 is still young! If you said 30 it would be different, but 20 is no biggy. Try to find a girl with the same values as you, someone who wants to wait for a serious commitment. You should have no trouble finding one!    As for us non-virgins, well, I would not be turned off at all.|`|akL3tUnmaa	I personally see it as kind of a good thing. You are obviously a good guy who doesn't use girls. I cannot tell you how many girls would kill to have a guy like that. If girls say that it is a turnoff then they are not good enough for you. To be rejected because you want to wait for the right person is crazy. Stick to your guns and wait for the right girl. She will come.|`|UzRdgOetaa	It's a great thing! it shows how awesome you are for waiting fo rthe right person. most girls who prefer to have a virgin. i know i would, along with many of my friends. so don't do anything you don't want to do unless you are sure you are ready, beacuse girls will still be all over you.|`|W3qILaLMaa	I think that it's a really good thing! I didn't lose my virginity until I was almost 20! I've been with the same guy for 2 years! I think that it means that you're disciplined and you don't have to have sex to prove anything!|`|0zHj2nZqaa	If you want to wait then thats what you need to do! I'm sure you will find someone amazing that will respect your ways. Stay strong, you will be happy soon!|`|HeOwMaxaaa	YES it IS a turn off. But you sound hot.|`|F8D0l0sRaa	aw well i wouldnt find it to be a turn off   in a way it could be a very good thing cuz it would be your  not like 95% of guys but most girls hear about how  many ppl a guy has been with normally get turn off...  i wouldnt want you to rush into anything you knew you werent ready for|`|ZN12wK9iaa	That's not a turnoff at all. Waiting just shows that you respect yourself and whoever you've ever gone out with. First off all, congratulations for being so respectuful. Do you know how hard it is to find a guy like you?? I mean your tall and everything AND you're a virgin. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's a turnoff because it's really not. Again, congratulations and I hope you find the perfect woman.

The only thing that I personally would be scared of is, if the guy (the virgin) and I have sex and he likes it so much, we break up so he can sew his oats. lol|`|8xPWd35maa	I really think that a girl would be lucky to find a 20 year old virgin college student.  I think that, at least I would feel embarassed because you were a virgin and waited and I didn't.  I really think that if you bothered to wait, then you should really keep searching until you find a girl who also bothered to wait.   It will mean so much for both of you.  Good for you!|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	no!!! turn on!!!     theyve gotta lose it somehow. why not do it when you;re in love?!|`|PcGvS4Xuaa	This is coming from a fellow virgin... NOT a turnoff. End of story.    edit: It doesn't sound like you're a virgin because you can't get girls, so don't worry about it. I think a lot of women will really respect you a LOT more because you can make that level of decision that most guys won't even touch. Personally, I'm waiting for marriage, but I think there are still merits to not being promiscuous. I think you'll find that the majority of people answering will agree with me when I say you are a rare find.|`|T8CHurVaaa	Hell yeah.   (small penis)|`|E859HitSaa	I'd say that's a good thing mate.|`|zpp9FDjIaa	not at all. it's a turn-on. it means that a guy is serious and isn't going to just give it up to anyone.|`|1hinQlz2aa	DANNNNNGGGG MAN! You are freakin tall!      and Girls tell me its a good thing.....|`|uvzuk10Eaa	good for you i admire you for holding on to it. Any girl who is not willing to respect your wishes is not worth the effort the right one will come along|`|6OIK5RsQaa	good question..well for me and not for everyone..I think your doing the right thing..thats a very good thing to be doing..wait for her some girls think virgin guys are fun lol..most girls will dump u or not date you at all if u had sex..I'm like that i'm a virgin and i'm waiting for a virgin guy..guys that have sex before marriage to me makes me mad and jealous for some reason..and it makes them seem like all they want from me is sex..if u wait it will be better..    trust me I talked to a lot of guys who had sex and I wish I could find one who didn't..I hate guys like that=)    much luck!|`|bKenpcoiaa	Being a virgin is a good thing. Don't do it until you're married.  Its actually a turn ON to most girls.  Hope you find the right girl. Good luck and God Bless!|`|4CINI0fsaa	its not a turnoff for me i think its a good thing it shows you are mature and you dont use girls for sex|`|40xNl5gnaa	If a chick won't date yuu because yuu are a virgin, then i don't think she is one that yuu would want to be in a serious relationship with in the first place.    Virgin guys are cute.. shows they are piggs.|`|Nul9hp7Zaa	no its not a turnoff.  and yes you are tall and intimidating.  im rather scared right now.  lol jk  no but seriously i am    hope i helped.|`|cb5522ea5bac3ee4d8f1779895290ac6aa	Not in my book.  & I for 1 AM a virgin so I'd be nice to share a cool experience with someone.  But some girls are bitches and are just looking for sex, so you just have to see who's right for you.|`|tl1oiDbZaa	Hellz no! Just don't tell her unless you feel comfortable having sex. I'm a 15 year old and my fiancee and I are going to stay virgins until we are married (I don't wanna hear how we are too young because I am merely telling this gentleman that it is okay). All in all, it depends on the girl. If she doesn't mind and is willing to give you pointers (sorry if this is embarrassing) take the opportunity while it is knocking.|`|qdaD5vELaa	i don't believe so. if you were to date a girl and all they wanted was sex, and they couldn't wait for you...then they are obviously not ready for a serious, committed relationship. you just have to be aware of who you are dating and do not let anyone have you do something you don't want to do, and vis-versus. and don't have your first time be with a drunk girl, you want it to be special, i think that the best idea is for both you and a future partner to wait until you are committed.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	My husband was a virgin when we got together and i was not and that has never been an issue for me because he wanted to wait until it meant something more than just physical needs and from my point of view it's nice because i never feel like I'm being compared and he's the best I've ever had because he didn't have preconceived ideas to overcome about how things should be done
AA10197672	Yup, either that or he had a few drinks before he opened up to ya. A lot of guys are scared of opening up and getting hurt at the end. So it will take some time.....|`|L8kSyfThaa	Why would a woman ?....its still in there and that wall is far to tall to climb......|`|P9wE9XZlaa	Yes they tend to do that every now and again....  ignore it and DONT  fall for it...|`|2fG6NpUkaa	cuz guys are pigs! they act like them they smell like them and sometimes they may eat like them! Guys are all around pigs! they get what they want and move on!|`|dSpLfZFnaa	It's called romance, the potential for heroic achievement, and the exotic.  Probably remembered he was married.|`|0ylm04PWaa	I think men get can intimidated or insecure about opening up their emotions to a woman. Here is one that takes the cake: Recently I flirted with one guy in a car who enjoyed it at first, then he burst out crying (yes crying!) and took out several bushes in his getaway (drive through lol). I posted an ad looking for him which he responded by giving me a youtube address.  I offered him friendship, literally a chance to get to know one another. He liked to write poetry, which I like. He wrote one about me then immediately after I posted a kind video reply to him, he goes and just closed out his youtube account and vanished on me again. Major insecurity issues there, and I bet that is what happened in your case.|`|tManvxfQaa	you said it INsecurity !!!|`|m81dfyOYaa	He'd probably had a few drinks and it lowered his inhibitions. Sober and in the light of day he realized it wasn't a good idea.|`|IvMPh09baa	because he's a complete tool.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Nervous Break Down|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You say that there was no sex involved - that might just be your answer. He may have been trying to get it and it didn't work, and now he doesn't want you to think that he meant any of it. If a man did that to me, I'd assume that's what had gone on.    In any case, I don't think that it's worth overthinking. If he "Took it all back the next day" then he lied when he "opened up" so I suggest finding a friend who isn't such a waste of time.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Maybe you violated a certain ethos about that person. Not even knowing it.    MotherOfAllChickens: Very interesting story. Hmmmm. Indeed. Musta been hella ugly ROFLMAO.
5DJzp6bMaa	Only For Very Insecure People|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If the cheater has a history of cheating, it is unlikely he/she will change short of a "Come to Jesus" event in his/her life. It is possible for cheaters to change their ways, but I wouldn't put my money on it.|`|tManvxfQaa	no...|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	In every single instance I know of, the cheater was a repeater.  There are no second chances in my book.|`|IvMPh09baa	I don't know... let's go check the dictionary and rule book for ALL cheaters.... surely there has to be something in writing that guarantees all cheaters do it again, right?  I mean everybody says it so it must be true... let's go find that Cheaters Bible... !! Wooohoo!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Trust is everything in a relationship when that is gone it never works.|`|AA10447831	IMO, yes. ONce you've crossed that line, why not do it again?|`|AA10197672	It really depends. Some ppl learn from their mistakes and when they get a second chance they use it wisely. However, somre are just idiots, and no matter how many chances u give them, they will always disapoint ya. Id say if you love him a lot, you give him another chance however explain that ths is his last chance and he should not expect you to forgive him if he cheats again. And see how things go, keep close eye on him...|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	that has been my experience,, been cheated on once too many times, have had more than my share of women too.it is definitely easier to cheat a second time,, once a line has been crossed once, it is easier to cross that line again|`|dRj9FoHzaa	I think we should look at the cause of why people cheat.  As long as the source that caused this behavior does not change, the person will most likely cheat again.   Otherwise, I do believe in second chance.|`|I814g6ZBaa	People can do something terribly wrong.  They can have regret and remorse.  They can make the choice to never do the wrong thing again ever; then not do it .    This applies to much more than INFIDELITY.    People around them can either have the GRACE to forgive them or not; their choice.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I'd apply the 80/20 rule.    80% of those who have cheated once only has a 20% chance of being rehabilitated.    80% of the remaining 20% has a 80% chance of becoming habitual cheaters.    20% of rehabilitated cheaters has a 80% chance of relapses.    I hope this answered your question.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	Yes, its true and they never change or do they want to.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	IT DEPENDS ...    If the person is sincere to change....|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	With the person he cheated on, yes. I believe that a person can cheat in one relationship, learn from their mistakes and never cheat in a future relationship. However, if I was the one that had been cheated on, there wouldn't be any second chance. But if he felt remorse about what he did to me, I think he CAN be faithful in future relationships. He would just have real, true, heartfelt remorse, though. Not just say "Yeah, I'm sorry. Can we go have sex now?". To be honest though, if I knew I was dating someone who had cheated in a previous relationship, I don't think I would be able to pursue a romantic relationship with that person because I would always be wondering "Has he REALLY changed?".|`|CCYTGHdyaa	No, if you really love someone, you will not cheat on them.   If your not really in love, then you will always be looking for someone who can make you happier.|`|FSVGnFkdaa	i say NO. i cheated once and never did it again...|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I think it is a matter if knowing why you cheated in the first place and then addressing that issue within yourself...I believe if you are honest and openminded enough to examine your motives truthfully then you will gain the insight needed to not repeat this in your next relationship.     Sometimes people get married and stay because of various reasons besides love...and then they meet someone along the way that reminds them how important love is and sparks that flame inside of them again....and then they are forced to first confront what is lacking in the marriage...and  only then can they can then decide to make the committment to repair their marriage or pursue another path.     I believe sometimes God puts a person on your path to give you a wake up call...sometimes it is Destiny redirecting your life because you will serve God better if you leave the path you are on...and sometimes you just fall for someone and know you can't let the opportunity pass you by....sometimes there are things we do not understand and are not meant for us to understand...so, no..that is not always the case.    and unfortunately YES there are the ones that fit perfectly into the  once a cheater is always a cheater box.|`|qVJxlWRpaa	It depends on the person but a lot of the time I would say yes! my husband of 14 years "loved me" and coming up on 10 years ago he did. We worked through it then he did it again last April I filed for divorce while he came and went 3 times the whole time lying there was nobody else when there was. We have not talked in over a month and one of the last conversations we had he admitted to another one that I never knew about in the first year we were married. He also admitted to cheating on his ex before me and since he came and went 3 times to my house he was technicaly cheating on me and his new girl that lives in Canada and he was with somebody else in the time he was with both of us. He turned it into one big ugly mess.|`|AA10278288	Absolutely
sIV2SFFGaa	i was sorely tempted to do that at my brother's wedding. his girl was a total moron, and i couldn't stand her, and i knew, for sure, that they weren't gonna last.    instead, i started a secret pool on how many months till divorce. i know, it's rotten and horrible, and i should have sucked it up and just ignored it and let them be, but i just couldn't stand it.    i sort of wish i had said something though, because i did end up winning the pool. they both had serious anger issues, and could never quit fighting long enough to do anything worthwhile.|`|S9jyc95jaa	Talk to your brother about your concerns privately, in a mature fashion.  There's just no reason to be so theatrical about it, like waiting until the day and then humiliating your brother in front of everyone he knows.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Nothing would happen.  You 'hating' this woman is not a legitimate reason to prevent the marriage from proceeding.    All that would be accomplished is that you would look like a colossal and immature idiot, your parents would be mad, your brother would be mad and any hope for a relationship with your sister-in-law would be ruined.|`|Lwved4teaa	thats horrible to ruin ANYONES biggest day of their lives like that!  you have to actually have a legit reason.  i can understand the situation you are in but u need to talk to your brother BEFORE the wedding.  dont expect him to change his mind just because of your opinion... especially last minute.  but interrupting the ceremony is just selfish and evil|`|uQosyhrSaa	GO 4 IT=D  that should be funnnn=]|`|c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	I would talk to your brother BEFORE the wedding and tell him why you think his fiancee is unfit to marry him.  If you spoke up at the wedding, you'd be on the bad side of both of them.|`|NvW6voPJaa	You would be a fool to do this.    You need a LEGAL reason for the objection, such as......she is already legally married; she is a felon; etc.    You can't object simply because you don't like her.      Leave it go.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	you have to have a valid reason.|`|YgggHhwuaa	Before doing that i would talk to him. Ultimately he is making the choice and unfortunately you will just look bad if you did it at the wedding.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Your brother would hate you and you would probably be kicked out. If you don't want to support his wedding, then don't go, but quite frankly, it is his choice if he wants to marry her or not, not yours.|`|AA10975867	Go finish your homework. Only a silly child would talk like that. "I hate her" is something an immature petulant little kid says when they are throwing a temper tantrum. They aren't even getting married and all you can do is hang around and think of childish pranks to pull. Grow up!|`|6L9jJnchaa	Make sure you get it on tape.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Lol, I'd love to know what would happen...let us know if you ever do it!|`|m13CCGc1aa	If he wants to marry her then for you to stand up in the middle of their wedding would be mean and selfish.    He is marrying her and it has nothing to do with you.  Both of them will be angry with you.  They are likely spending a ton of money on their wedding and if you ruin it, you will sabotage your relationship with both of them.|`|XfjAwH7Haa	you'd be very selfish, unless you knew your brother was going to die if he married her than its wrong. Just because you don't like her, doesnt mean your bro doesnt love her and that she doesnt love him back. Don't do it, don't be so self involved and decide for your bro what you think is right for him, let him decide.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	They will only stop it if you can show LEGAL reasons for the marriage being false.  Such as she is married to someone else and hasn't divorced yet.  If your brother marries her tell him your concerns before the wedding not AT the wedding. if it bugs you THAT much then don't show up.  What you want to do is very immature and could cause your entire family to turn on you.

All you have to do is prove her unfit and that you would provide a better environment for the children than her.  I would suggest a private investigator and document everything that you can prove without a reasonable doubt.  If there are things like her locking the kids out and leaving them home alone going on.  Tell the children to call the police when she leaves them alone like that to go party or when they are locked out because of her drinking.  I would suggest that you talk to your lawyer about the matter and if he/she isn't willing to go for full then you go to a lawyer that will.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	The best thing for you to do, is to get a lawyer asap, and start making a case. Its not impossible for you to get full custody. Lots of Dads have custody these day, and no matter what you think, Dads are getting fairer results.    Get as much information as possible, and start making a affadavit of events.    Keep in mind that given the older kids ages, they will probably get a say in where they want to live.    It will be a fight ......but worth every bit, to have your children in a safe environment.    Good Luck....|`|9463fac7b3034dd922bb76c0276e71c6aa	You have to be able to prove your claims to the court, if the children were locked out of the house as claimed, DSS would have removed the children for child endangerment. (I worked for Dept of Families and Children) But the worker has to have the same proof that the judge would have. The courts see fathers and mother making claims against the other everyday in court as to abuse, physical sexual or otherwise. Most of the judges assume it is just another parent trying to get out of paying child support or getting back at the other parent,using the court as a war zone to do so.  Rarely will they change the person that has primary custody, without proof that the other parent is unfit.   So your best bet would be to contact the person with DSS, find out what the investigation reveled, possibly have them summons to court.They will have talked to neighbors, teachers and other possible witnesses.   Have your children write letters to the court about what happened. (Again, risky because parents coach kids into saying things that are not true, and the courts know it)    I know this is heart wrenching, and I go through it as well with my ex. We have shared custody. Their are times I would like to choke him, for medical neglect of my daughter, and unfortunately the best I can do, is during my time get her to treatment she needs.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	With all these issues you are better served to take this matter into court rather than detail in your question..matters of custody and parenting issues need to be addressed in front of a judge..providing all needed documentation to prove your case|`|hvwp2bcVaa	I hope 100%...I am really sorry that the babies have to go through all of this...my heart weeps for them
1m9988e1aa	just sit down with them and talk to them they are your family and evetually they will come around or they may just accept it when you tell them. and if you are wearing your sisters clothes chances are they may already know even if you havent been caught. i agree with you though on the fact that girls can wear anytihng they want and its ok but a guy cant wear a dress and heels. its just not right and not fair.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	You need to make them understand or they'll think you're crazy and need psychiatric treatment.    Here is how you could make it okay:    Say, "Mom, you know there used to be a time when girls couldn't wear trousers, and society thought that girls who did were trying to act like men.  Society thought these girls were a threat to femininity.  Do you think it was a good thing that women challenged society and earned the right to wear pants, and other men's clothing?"    She will say that she is glad that girls can wear anything they find comfortable.    Then say that you think men should challenge society and be able to wear anything they want too.  Men need to challenge society and free themselves from the tyranny of trousers.  Ask her if she will help you with your freedom mission.  Tell her you want to see if you can get comfortable in them and will only wear them inside the house.  Maybe you'll be brave enough to wear them in public, but you're not comfortable with that for now.      I bet she will let you test yourself out, and she may even offer a few suggestions.  Oh, yes, you will have to assure her that you are 100% straight and have no interest in changing your gender at all.|`|6L9jJnchaa	My best guy friend is a crossdresser.  He has not told his family, but he has very close friends like me that accept him for who he is.  I suggest you find some friends like that if you are not ready to tell your family yet.

x8c4pbJWaa	Alot of girls smell really good because we take good care of ourselves. We lotion our bodies with strawberry scented lotions, we always make sure our breath is good, we wear perfume, make sure we use good hair products that make our hair smell clean.. etc. You get the idea. We girls love to pamper ourselves & men love when we do it.    Also, you're a boy, you are actually programmed to be attracted to the smell of a girls "pheromones" -- it's part of the human mating ritual. Haha!    Needless to say, there is nothing wrong with you.|`|DGigWUXgaa	cuz were not guys...|`|VALxlwYSaa	Well of course you should know everyone has their own smell lol.   But mostly because girls like fruity shampoo's and things. I for one have been told, even though I don't wear perfume, that I smell good all the time.   I always thought a lot of guys smelt good too! Like I know you say they sweat more, which is gross, but some colognes and shampoo's guys use are like... amazing. :D   Axe, old spice, and Irish spring are my favorite :P|`|cb5WcNHsaa	STUPID QUESTION BECAUSE WE ACTUALL TAKE BATHS AND NOT WEAR COLOGNE AND THEN LIE THAT YOU DID TAKE A BATH|`|az3pEbglaa	aha[; this question made me laugh. it's cute. well.............    girls love to look and smell good. so we always take baths, [i bathe twice a day..some people don't]. we also use scented soaps and oh yeah. THE SHAMPOO. always smells good. when a girl has nice long hair, and they bed over [like you explained]. it's bound to be noticed. but yeah, we always use scented deoderant, eprfume, body mist/spray etc.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	No you are not weird.

9VhR1XwOaa	It depends on why she left you.  if she broke up with you because she was unhappy with the relationship or another serious then chances are that she's not coming back.    However, if she left you for someone else, then there's always a chance. I'm sorry to say that it's not a very good chance, but it can happen.   Usually, if you want her, you have to make an effort to get her back as well.  Don't expect her to come runnning hun  I'm sorry to hear about your situation  Feel better and good luck :)|`|E859HitSaa	If you were right. Yet don't count on it.|`|f6071008fb25bb51e007d7ff78a9e0f8aa	Your name seems to fit - Mr. Emotional.    Move on - there are many girls out there and at your young age you need to experience life with many more before you think you've found love.  Remember the good feelings you had in that relationship and move on. By moving one and meeting other young girls, you give yourself a chance to enjoy a variety of gilrs and find your one true-love.    Slow down and enjoy as many ladies as possible before settling down with one - you're too young to fret over once lost love.|`|sc6VBAmzaa	It could happen. You could rekindle the the fire you two had in the future. I knew this guy whose first love left him 2years ago and comes back and cries and askes to get back together because she made the wrong mistake. Now they are getting married in 3months. And my current bf had an ex that kept going back to him, but she was using him during that time. If its meant to be, then it will happen. Good Luck!

Firstly, i would tell myself never to go with another woman's boyfriend again, then i would get some self-respect, then i would kick him in the nuts and tell him i never wanted to see his pathetic, cheating, disrespectful face again.    I'm sure that you are worth a lot more than that.  Good luck to you.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	So he playing both sides of the fence. this problem ant hard,,DUMP HIM AND DON'T TAKE HIM BACK PERIOD EVEN AS A FREIND.. go find a man that wants what you want .. and really loves you..|`|oxRYyWKHaa	Dating in the work place is bad and it can complicate the job . Worse if he wants to be an major *** he can tell all the guys your easy . But as for your problem here is your answer .   (1) He is still in love with the ex and ever time she whistles he will go running .   (2) Every time she thinks he has someone else she is going to whistle just to get him away from you and keep that leash as tight as possible .   (3) He is a man and can't help himself . Just drop him and move on if he starts to make trouble tell him you will tell the ex about your dating him while he was with her . That should put him in his place .|`|wFWytGlxaa	I was in the same situation not too long ago.    Now he wants to be friends. Why? Because I kicked him to the curb and his best friend reported to him that he saw me "out and about with other guys." Men want what they cannot have. But that person whom he cannot have. Do you get the picture? Next time this guy wants to come back and apologize for all the things he has done to you -- you will accept the apology but will not, I repeat WILL NOT, hop back into bed with him. You will be his "friend" first and foremost -- nothing more nothing less. Go out and have fun, let it sink to him that he had a good thing but he screwed that up.    Good Luck!|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Sounds like he dosent know what he wants, but I would bet my money on that, it was is ex that has finished with him, and hes just using you in between the breaks ups.

7cjqT33Baa	Your Mom doesn't sound like the healthiest person. The suicide thing is a sign of a really unbalanced person.  That is something she has to deal with on her own. You have a choice to follow in her footsteps and turn out the same way as her or to take it and look at it as an example of what not to be and focus your energies on bettering yourself, not battling her.  As long as you are under her roof, she'll treat you how she wants and make all the rules.  Why if you want to live with your Dad aren't you?  It sounds like it might be the best choice right now.  Your Mom is responsible for her own life and actions.  It's not fair for her to emotionally manipulate you the way that she is.  Stress, even in your age, is so harmful on our bodies and our spirits.  If you are being a brat, just stop it and not give her that kind of fuel for the attacks. No yelling, no name calling, no drama etc. If you can't communicate in a healthy way with her, don't communicate.  I would do what she said to do and then retreat from her as much as possible.  It won't be long until you are an adult and can pay your own way and live on your own.  I know from experience how hard it can be to have a Mom that doesn't support you.  But also realize that there are a lot of things that go on in an adults life that you are too young to fully understand.  You might be being a little hard on her when you call her names like you do.  You don't know all the details.|`|3m8JgWj1aa	you need to print this entire thing out that you just wrote and call your old counselor and read it to her. also show your dad how you feel and tell your mom you want to go back to the counselor and instead have her walk in with you and have your dad there and sort of have an intervention where she ends up seeing the counselor instead of you because THIS is serious. and if you really need to talk to her boyfriend|`|vQ8NPLzLaa	take time out on your own, avoid your mother|`|6J2NqXX0aa	i agree with the first 2 people who answered your question. good luck, and hope i helped.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	She sounds weird and bizarre and if shes always pulling stuff then yes ending the friendship is wise. Who knows what she might pull on you eventually.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	You are perfectly correct to end your friendship.   Believe me after you have been raped no matter what the circumstances there is no way you would want to keep contact with the alleged rapist.   She obviously concocted this story so she could keep her current boyfriend (who has now dumped her), in case he found out she got drunk & fooled around with this other guy.    I get very frustrated with girls who cry 'rape' when it obviously wasn't. Not only has she betrayed & lied to you she has done the same to her now Ex boyfriend.       If she is always in 'bizarre' situations, then I think she is a "Drama Queen"  Stay away from her & don't be drawn into her web of lies & deceit.  Take care & good on you to realise her B/S.|`|HZMAWOHZaa	I don't think you should have ended the relationship you have with her completely. Even if she does lie a lot, don't just forget about her.    But personally it sounds like it could go either way. Maybe it wasn't rape, maybe she was willing but didn't want it to sound too bad when she told you?|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	What ever happened was not rape.  Rape is a very serious and devastating thing and your friend should not make up stories.  If she is talking to a guy who she claims raped her she is either a liar or in need of serious psychiatric help.  You were not wrong to end the friendship especially if you felt uncomfortable.
1IU0QCquaa	I'm wondering if you got married too soon after your son's death.|`|AA11190264	sweetie, you have to do some soul searching. think of what good for you. think of what makes you happy. if your marriage is not working out; seek counseling before you make the decision to leave and go with your heart. your love for your husband has taken a differnt form. the kind that is not what it was. over 14 years, you just have to give him that choice; just can't cut it off dry. there are more steps involve to reach your contentment. heart to heart talk and a marriage counseling are your steps

kgdoO6ygaa	Catch her when she's not with her friends.  She only is surrounded by your friends when your there because she just might like you two but she wants to have protection i guess.  if you can't catch her you should ask her to talk to you "alone"   then once you've got her face to face,  just tell her full force.  online isn't a very good way to go,  it makes you look like you have no guts.  so just make the right decision and tell her how you feel in person. plus it makes the girl feel a lot more special.    hope i helped. ;)|`|ELVAZMY4aa	She blocked you on msn?  Do you know why she blocked you?    I don't know how old the two of you are.  Are you both in high school?  Work together?  I have a feeling she's not that into you.

That's just a gut feeling I have.|`|uNKJBh2oaa	Okay...i just helped a friend with this a couple months ago...they have been going out ever since....    ...first tell her there is something u really have to tell her and get of ur shoulders....then tell her she doesn't have to agree...just for her to think about it...that u don't know if u came on too hard flirting and stuff....or if she thought it was too much....but you really like her...and you would like to get to know her more....if she doesn't say anything to u when u say that...tell her u will give her some space and time to think...she will think u really respect her....by saying that....then ur hooked...|`|6c36e0c036abc0f6c5fe7dd5164c8bf0aa	Don't tell her how you feel. Just ask her out on dates. Be really sweet, but don;'t be too obvious. If she feels uncomfortable with going out with you alone, just take her out on a group outing. If she avoids you when you try to be alone with her, she doesn't have any interest in you. Be agressive, but don't scare her away.    If you have a hard time saying things in person, write a letter, don't do it online. A letter is more intimate and actually shows that you took time to write something yourself. Be really sweet to her in ways only you know you can. If she gets grossed out or shows no interest, just move on because she doesn't see anything in you to like. Get off that online tip and start talking on the phone. Keep conversations sweet and short, otherwise if you prolong things she'll get bored. Be the first one to hang up when the conversation is going great. She'll be left with wanting more.|`|YkD1OT9Gaa	im sorri but she doesnt like you obiviously...  but she might change her mind if you tell her in person,  and ask her if u can go somewhere alone and just talk 2 her, tell her   tht its important, and if she says no she wont go w/u somewhwere in private, then whisper it into her ear...  tht 'd be cute:)|`|UbZ8z16Maa	Tell her how you feel|`|UzdWZSTWaa	If she blocked you, that should be a sign she is not interested.

Confidence is sexy to women, at least to most. And rarely talking to her face to face doesn't show that you blew your chance with her, just that you never had one.

sr7jX2wYaa	Yes  it  is a bad idea  to date  someone 16 or 177 when you are 13/14.   If  you ex is the 16/17 year old, no don't tell him, if he  is you age go ahead & let him know, he may still have  feelings  for you too*|`|aRDXTWIDaa	um..... idk what to tell you about the first one. it's a little weird but if you really love him, then the matters of the heart triumph over all.  As for question two, let it be, let fate decide.|`|AA12378278	well i don't think its bad because im 14 and my boyfriend just turned 18  but the fact that you think you were IN love with your ex is a problem  we're too young to be IN love  loving someone and being IN love with someone are two completely different things  but if you still like him i think you should tell him and see how he feels|`|V4nP6jAMaa	First question:  it depends on the guy  like if they have a bad past  dont even waste your time  but i mean if there really sweet  and treat you REALLY well then  no i wouldnt consider it bad..  Second question:  theres a reason hes your ex  and if you still have feelings for  him then yes you should probably tell  him; you'll feel better after and if he  totally ignores you or like doesnt care  that you still have feelings for him  then just move on  Hope that helps(:|`|l87SLSwgaa	All good if your 13/14 going out with 17/18yr old. Not OK if your 17/18 going out with 13/14 yr old. Eeew|`|2ja54L20aa	uhmm, love, it's illegal...  well, it's not illegal to DATE, but kissing, anything sexual w/e, that's def. illegal.  sorryyy :(((
QkmoNX2Qaa	Just say  oh... I'm sorry.. I wont do it anymore then.  Don't sulk about it. Coz otherwise she'll think that ur immature.    Don't worry about it okay.    :)  x|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	She was probably annoyed by something else and took it out on you. For real - I take out my frustrations on people a lot. She probably just let that build up and said it harsher than she meant it. Let her calm down, apologize and say you don't mean to. Don't get angry with her back because it will just get worse!|`|YTSJR9V1aa	you say :    "it's you're. not your"  haha, just kidding.    she could have easily just been frustrated that day.  granted, it was bitchy and you should tell her that you think it was unnecessary.  sometimes, people are just in bad moods and cannot tolerate stuff they normally can.  ask her if she's ok.|`|YvZKd1ycaa	well, ouch.  was she pmsing, or r u seriously annoying? i guess if she doesn't like ur personality, she shouldn't have agreed 2 go out w/ u in the 1st place|`|1hinQlz2aa	tell her she is ugly, punch her in the face, then cry home|`|i9ST2JBwaa	she wants to be independent, let her be and learn for herself.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Fart in the phone and hang-up.|`|IkdB22IXaa	You are probably annoying.|`|akL3tUnmaa	Tell her it's over! She sounds rude and demeaning.|`|S318F1ocaa	She found someone who is "cooler" and less vocal to be with and she no longer likes you.|`|0n2tpS1oaa	ahaha.  but seriously, ask her why...and go from there. lol dont get insecure about it or anything. she's gonna not like SOMETHING|`|320b2762f5cd39e51c805fc8b1bb91bbaa	STOP DOING THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ANNOYES HER.... THAT IS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP HER...|`|uuHDQr1paa	My girlfriend called me a hipster doofus.|`|E3ue1nWAaa	Maybe all it is is a sign to say back off a little.  The reason she delivered it so harshly is probably because the tension had been building for awhile and she just snapped.  Just don't be so uptight about her attitude.  And if it's that bad that you always mention it to her, maybe you should just dump her.  Hope my advice has helped. =D|`|PSZEw34Kaa	MABEY YOU GUYS CAN MEET HALF WAY :)    no offense, but try cutting down on critizing, and she could take a chill pill :)  hope it helps, and gud luck bro|`|nKKi1hANaa	tell her to get lost|`|AA12220250	she doesnt like u as in a relationship then. dump her.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	. . . sorry? wow. she is bitchay.|`|AA11289793	Well just tell her that you are sorry that you act that way and that you can't help it you just like to try and understand her and help her understand herself, and that you are sorry and you will try to stop doing it since it bothers her so much...|`|QrSFskUpaa	just tell her that she is also annoying|`|N8hNdlNnaa	I want you to look deep in to your heart, is she really your girlfriend and are you really annoying, oh really you just don't know|`|CtCaVVHVaa	treat her like ****,  she will love you.|`|sc6VBAmzaa	Oo wow, okay that would honestly annoy me too if you keep making comments on her attitude. It could cause her some self esteem issues in the future. But then again I understand your point of view because youwant her to be aware of her attitude I guess. I wish my bf would let me know sometimes to help me out. Just try not to teach her things all the time and let her discover them, with you or on her own. Good Luck.|`|fgaruS74aa	HADOKEN!!!!!!!|`|61L9P2tQaa	hahhahaha.. trust me we have all heard that type of ****... but the downside is annoying is usually something u dont wana be with ur gf. once a gf finds u annoying it means that there is more to it.. im not saying cheating or anything i mean she mite be feeling distant or something along those lines|`|ApnV9ePZaa	Dump Her?
PzbRJrTKaa	well my best friend is like my sister i am always aht her house, and we are always doing things together'.! i lovee her, and everybody sayes we look just a like, so we call each other twins'.!|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	Someone you can tell anything to and they wont think any different about you, and they will help you out of anything. Someone you talk to everyday and visit every weekend|`|BOQxPnjCaa	they are people who i am willing to give up my life for and i kno they will do the same  && they will do anything to make me smile  && fight for me even if there parents dont agree im a good person  they are more then a best friend   there my sister|brother & i love them like my own self  there my life & i would be empty without them|`|lcgIGkq5aa	People you can turn to for anything and they are always there for you no matter what and they always make you laugh and you like spending time with them|`|8Y9EogN0aa	someone who can be themselves around each other. be there when you need it most. someone who can lift you up when you are down. a person you can trust and rely on. also have similar interests. you can have several good buddies, but you may only have only 2 life-long friends throughout your life.|`|b5c63e5c4444118f0dd91401617ff8b0aa	lol its just kiddy stuff lol|`|3vx1oE7Zaa	It means encouraging them to use complete sentences, proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar.|`|f6071008fb25bb51e007d7ff78a9e0f8aa	As you get older, usually, your Best Friend list gets smaller.    For me, at age 44, a Best Friend is someone I can talk to about almost anything and still be loved and accepted. A Best Friend is someone that is always available but not always needed.|`|J6OhuXJhaa	it means a person who is always there for you and if you get into a fight you know they wont tell all your secrets and you have known them and their parents for ever and it feels like yall are sisters or brother and sister what ever|`|K9KKnnKyaa	best friends are someone you can tell anything, and share anything with!

Hope S  Kara S  Alice K|`|JtvP6vjvaa	I believe there is no best friends only people you have a good relationship with, someone who would lie to you, steal from you, or keep anything from you. And when you say your my "best friend" other friends get jealous almost. So I only have friends.|`|RQD7Z0eXaa	They mean having someone that is almost impossible to stay in a fight with for over a day.  A best friend means having someone to go to no matter what problem you are having.  Personally, I love the saying...A good friend is someone that would bail you out of jail.  A best friend is someone who would be right next to you in jail saying, "Oh fcuk, we messed up big time."  A best friend to me is someone you can randomly hug without them being confused as to why you hugged them.  A best friend is someone you can be totally weird with without caring what anyone else thinks.  Basically, a best friend is like a sister or brother you aren't related to.  Me and my best friend go to overnight camp together so to me a best friend is someone who when you haven't seen each other in forever will run into your arms screaminhg your name because you have missed each other so much over the winter.|`|dae8fb1369e00f3992a22f0805c2e292aa	well let's see... best friends to me mean exactly this:      they are the ones you don't have to talk to everyday, who understand why you didn't take their advice to not call him/her or why you keep going back to him/her after he/she breaks your heart, the ones who call you at 4 am to let you know they're drunk, who listen when they've heard the same story a thousand times, the ones who call just to say hi, & whether you're dancing on the table or passed out drunk, they'll turn and say, that's my best friend.|`|3LIW9PhNaa	Best friend are people who you trust and know they will always be there 4 you no matter what.|`|59xjQCLIaa	someone that u have to talk to everyday, that when something happens u have to tell them|`|3167dd75002e885197d080779fdd90a8aa	Someone who doesn't stab you in the back, or put you down. However, if they do that your liable to get through it. Some best friends have fights that draw them closer, some don't. I think its a perspective thing. A best friend is someone you can trust, someone who will stick up for you, and keep you from making a wrong decision.  Don't put all your trust in a best friend though, you never know what could happen! Best friends are supposed to always be there, help you out when you need it. A best friend is someone you can count on, and you know they won't let you down(thats not to say that if they do they're unreliable though).  **EDIT**  Oh yea, and someone that accepts you for who you are, and no matter how long they've known you they still deal with craziness or whatever other odd quirks a person might have.|`|j19Flj1Paa	you people? what do you mean... you people?
AA11080047	you can tell her but i think to know avail shes love struck|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	I'd stay right out of it, let her work it out for herself otherwise she might blame you for any repercussions.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If you tell her, her heart will get broken.  For now, I think you should stay out of it because you don't want to get involved with this.|`|6J2NqXX0aa	maybe try and explain to the guy, that your friend is in love with him. and ask the guy if he can just hang out with your friend for a while, maybe that will help your friend.|`|tS2BpqTiaa	you should tell her that she should'nt be wasting her time liking a guy who does'nt like her back. tell her the honest truth, that's what friend's are for. and if she gets mad at you then oh well, you know you're not lying to her so you should'nt feel bad about anything.|`|ZITL8kSiaa	The best thing to do is just stay out of her business.. not trying to sound mean or anything.. let her find out on her own.|`|JtvP6vjvaa	If she loves this dude then tell her to ask him out, and if he says he DOESN'T like her, she will figure it out from herself and if she was a good friend she wouldn't blame you if she gets rejected and it will help her in the future to ask guys out.
wEzY0VPIaa	if you are serious about killing yourself you need to see a doctor. if your were just exaggerating then you shouldn't joke that way and know that if you two were meant to be it would work out.
NEw5dsJlaa	Gay guys are almost always overwhelmingly sexy to me, i feel your pain. I think it is the mix between them knowing better than anyone what makes a man attractive, and the subconscious wanting something you can't have. Take a good look at your husband and appreciate his commitment to you, that is something that an openly gay man would not be able to give you. Try not to fantasize about this gay guy, instead try spicing it up with your man, buying him clothes or a hair cut to make him seem more "beautiful".|`|vUETXZUhaa	no you should make sex with him and stop him from being gay|`|HIMwyeZqaa	Sounds like you want to toy with cheating but you want to take it very slow.  You think since he has described himself as gay that he would not move too fast for sex with a girl.  You can say that you would not cheat now but that could change as your relationship with Joe changes.  Would you consider it cool for your husband and a self described lesbian to be flirting.  The homosexual life style is very heavy on sex, especially male homosexuals|`|XGZBEdAWaa	Honestly you feel that way because joe is safe. Since he's gay nothing will ever happen between the two of you so you don't really have to worry about it...  Unless of course you see him as a challenge.  Some women find it a turn on to see if they have what it takes to make a gay guy go straight even if it's for one brief moment. So which of these categories do you fall into?|`|daoFR48xaa	looks like u have a pretty big problem. U love ur husband.....but u have a crush on ur gay friend............honestly ur gay friend is GAY......i must admit that some gay guys r flipping sexy......but he is obviously not interested in women. U just need 2 forget bout that whole little section of u guy life. MOVE ON.......U R MARRIED....HE IS GAY......IT IS NOT GUNNA HAPPEN. And if by some chance it does....then u need 2 feel really guilty.
CoKAaPYqaa	Well....lets just say if ya stick it in... and cant tell that you stuck your weenie into anything.... that pretty much tells you that shes NOT.    If you have to almost pry the hole open with clamps then she probably is. You cant just go by if she bleeds after sex , bcuz I didnt my first time having sex. So i donno if my cherry didnt get popped and he was too small or what. Because years later i bled pretty bad during sex and... he was huge. So shes either tight or shes loosey|`|pFS2LZGKaa	You can't tell.. some girls bleed during their first sexual intercourse,  some girls don't and some feel the pain but some don't  Girls can lie to you so watch out|`|m5NV1GBUaa	Ask her, and if you trust she most likley will be honest.|`|SSM8aV5Uaa	UMM ASK H3R YOU CANT TELL BY JUST LOOKING AT HER|`|wEzY0VPIaa	you can't. you need to ask. she wont lie
eb8493f8405a86443a46ce36449c9353aa	i agree with you you put in your fair share so you should get the respect do.|`|m13CCGc1aa	No matter how much cleaning you do, the house is his and your mother's.  If you don't like the way they run things, move out.  If you are paying them rent then you should have space of your own that they shouldn't enter without your prior approval--just like any other landlord tenant relationship.|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	I agree. You have to live there too.|`|BNXmmscmaa	well its his house.You don't pay the bills.how would you like it if you fell asleep some were and someone didn't like that because they just didn't and who wants to be waken up when there comfortable if he wasn't he would have gone to bed by himself, right yeah so just give hi m his room because your Very  lucky he is letting you stay in his house so i suggest if he snores to loud by these things that go over your nose and you wont here one sound.trust me they relay do work!
rApLHbmWaa	I have previously had this same problem and it is very hard to deal with but the main thing is that there is nothing you can do or say that will make her be the same person that she was. Don't say anything to her that will regret... Which there was a lot of things that my mother said that hurt my feelings, but you just have to take it and go on...  Just realize that she is not being civil and even though she is doing crazy things everyone else should stick together and not let her tear your nerves all to pieces.. Sad to say, but if she just up and says she's leaving one day you should just let her go!  We let My Mom know that we didn't approve of the way she was acting and if just make her blow up one day and decided she didn't want to live anymore and all kinds of things that was really really difficult to imagine coming from her!  Once everyone lightened up on her she then became another completely different different person who was definitely not christian acting and not deppressed either.... Just weird...  It is actually still going on and i have learned that you have to let her go and do whatever she wants to do without saying anything and if she says things to you that are really hurtful... you have to kinda avoid her!  Anyway point being... she is going to do what she is going to do or be who she is going to be and everyone else just needs to stick together and be strong!  Good Luck and god Bless you. I know these are really hard times but remember that it is not your fault and don't ever blame it ono yourself.|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	Maybe your mum is having a personal crisis and she may need someone to talk to. You could sit down with her and tell her that you noticed a change in her and ask her of she wants to talk about how she is feeling. If this doesn't help then perhaps you could turn to your family and band together to talk (not confront) your mother about her behaviour. You could also try to do little things for your mum to let her know that you care (helping around the house, pick her flowers, make dinner one night). Good luck :)|`|66jX06Onaa	Your mom may benefit from counseling. If she benefits, your family will benefit. Encourage your dad to talk to her about seeing her doctor and getting a recommendation for a counselor.    Women go through a lot of changes as they get older. There is a chance that your mom is starting menopause - even if she's in her 30s. In any case, she should get in to see her doctor so this can be looked into.|`|QXLO2fzIaa	Has anyone tried to talk to her? She sounds like she's very defensive and maybe needs someone to tell her that she's being that way. I would just talk to her and let her know how her actions/attitude makes you feel. It doesn't sound like it could get any worse.|`|HtZBATJNaa	sounds like my own mother. god help you. i totally understand how you feel. all i can say is be patient with her, shes your mum and we should respect and love our mums no matter what. as shes extra sensitive, try to treat her nicely and remeber that shes paranoid and woudn't take any kind of jokes. try helping her with house work, give her a massage, etc so that she feels special. if that doesn't work then confront her, talk to her calmly explain how you feel exactly and i hope she will understand you. just try and be senstive to her feelings.     good luck|`|1oJ1qokjaa	sounds like she's going through a really tough time.  and its very frusterating when you and the rest of your family is trying to be upbeat but she's pessimistic. it can definately bring you down.  i know how that is.  i think the best thing you can do is be there for her. give her a hug. tell her just how much you appreciate and love her.  how much she is needed. tell her that you miss the old her and if there is something that has really been bothering her, she can tell you.  help her. just be there.  talk it out. she will feel better with a stable support system. dont say you know how she feels but say i know this must be hard. tell her that if she needs any help, you will try your best to do whatever she needs.  just help her figure out things. you can feel that everything will be okay but nothing will get better if she's stressing out. if you guys stay positive, things have to work out.  itll atleast make the situation a little brighter and youd appreciate if she tried her best to stay strong. right now, im dealing with a stressed out mom who doesnt seem to give a care about a lotta things and it helps to talk it out.  shes stressed and needs someone to lean on. be that person for your mom and things have to start to get a little better atleast. good luck =]
bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	Be yourself and be friendly. You want people to like you because of who you are not who you want them to think you are. You will be discovered by the bestest friends in time. But you will never know who they are untill you are older and grow up. So just try and make the best of it while you can. Remember to pick and choose the people in your life carefully.

Once you're in, you're with people that have a common interest and hopefully this will open the doors of conversation and friendship.     However, you have to be willing to open your mouth and talk.|`|AA11047177	dont worry,    it takes more than a week to get socialize wiht strangers and to become frnds, just do what you have to do, and be a normal person, and sure evryone will come towards you|`|LYVDtbFZaa	As a shy-ish person I understand it when you say that you can't just start talking to them, but start with one person, maybe one that you sit next to, and just talk to them about school; their other classes; and then gradually move into other topics. it will get easier trust me
sEFmjAJkaa	So.    When will we all see you Two on "THE Maury Show"?      for a FREE DNA test???    I bet soon!|`|66jX06Onaa	Give him time. You can't blame him for being angry. Stop contacting him for a month.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I don't blame him, that's a pretty immature thing to do.

Now he has no choice but to wait for the DNA test because who knows if what you are saying is true or not.|`|wrs4kLReaa	he probably is hurt. and i'm sure he is questioning if he is the father or not.

You should be ashamed.|`|ZEYkDuxCaa	I wouldn't talk too you either, now he will always ask is this child really mine or someone else's.  It won't matter if you told him you were just made he will always wonder in the back of his head.

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Don't let guilt get in the way of your future. It is completely natural for kids to move out, go to school, and work on a future. It's the way it is meant to be!  Your mom has the other kids to keep her company, but she will appreciate your visiting as often as you can. Go for your out-of-town education, I'm sure it's what SHE would want!|`|LnKxArPgaa	I know its hard but you should do what is best for you and your future.  There is no need to feel guilty.  Just visit and keep in contact with your mom as much as possible.|`|3BrOSZujaa	You are an adult you have rights do what you think is right but be kind.|`|IvMPh09baa	ok, glad to help.    but first quesiton, why is this in marriage and divorce?|`|AA10822361	go  it will be a good experience for you|`|fUhosu5Raa	i would go.. your mother needs to realize that her children are eventually going to grow up and move out and do there own things.. i would do it... being on your own helps|`|b8WLu1kbaa	don't go|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	Leave now or you never will. You need to learn to be your own person.|`|UECCsRKvaa	Whatever you think is best for you. Do you REALLY want to go to this college or could you settle for a different one in your town?|`|P9wE9XZlaa	follow your heart...i m same only child in different city  my mom still making me feel guilty..  but i have become stuborn heheheheh|`|1jk3D9f8aa	"should i stay or should i go!" doo doo doo!    (haha, sorry, that's a good song.)    anyways, i say you go. yur mom already had time to grow up and have her own life. now you need to grow, and to do that you need space. ever kid/parent has to let go and create distance. that way you know how to live on your own :)    don't worry. goodbyes aren't always forever.    plus, absence makes the heart grow stronger.|`|DtrdTV87aa	If you stay then you might regret that too. I say do what's going to make you happy. You have to live for you. Go start your Independence|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Just go to that University out of town but making sure you can come home often to visit your mom.|`|jZGdb1bqaa	If you want to go to a university in another town then go. If you don't and you let your mum hold you back you will end up regretting it for the rest of your life..and you only get one chance at life. Don't feel guilty although i know its hard, i can kind of relate because my older brother has recently moved out and moved to Australia with his new family and my mum finds that really difficult. The thing is is im applying to a uni over in australia too and my mum is going to be heartbroken. But we can't live for our parents. There comes a point in time where they have to let us go and let us be our own people. Just go out there and make her proud. She had a life before you, she can have a life without you.|`|vGiXqViXaa	whatever your heart tells you|`|NV3eIjLcaa	What does this have to do with her?|`|uvzuk10Eaa	your an adult who needs to make and adult decision your mum will be fine and so will you i say move be happy and live your life|`|g5CEwzsSaa	go dont be bossed around go be independent|`|GhETSRdUaa	I say that you should go. It's not like you can't visit a ton, or anything.    Do what YOU want, don't hold yourself back for others.|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	wtf, you type like caca. I would advise NO COLLEGE go back to the first grade and learn how to talk!|`|QrSFskUpaa	tell her one day or another you have to leave and right now it is the best time because it is for a good reason: school. Tell her you will call her and visit her when you can.|`|AA11319441	With spelling and grammar like this, I wouldn't worry about being "at university" very long.         Just as a point of fact....because it drives me apeshit when I see it...WE are all Americans here, and we say "Going To College".  We do not say "going to University", or going to "Uni".   That's retarded.  Knock it off.  If you want to talk like that, leave North America.|`|RYDwwTITaa	Follow your heart for one. And besides, university is a decision that will affect the REST OF YOUR LIFE. And at one point or another, you'll have to move out, and your mother will have to deal with an empty nest. But despite her being sad about it, i'm sure that she will be extremely proud that her children are out in the real world, making something of their lives.|`|cPIYUWxyaa	i think u should stay.|`|qdGZMGdkaa	Go. If there is one decision you will regret for the rest of your life, it will be staying close to home. If you do stay you may end up resenting your mom in the long run which is the last thing your mom would ever want. I go to a University 45 minutes from home and I regret being this close to home. I was the last one of my siblings to leave home and still haven't really left because I am only 45 minutes away. I think that if you want to go to another town go for it. Don't underestimate your mothers strength. It will be hard for her at first, but if she knew you had any doubt in your mind because of her, she would not want that. Go! |`|7Msk7HhKaa	I think the best way to look at this is as a test. You can either do what you think is best for you, or you can stay and do what's best for others. Either decision will have it's own benefits. I will, say though, that you would be better off to stay. It shows that you are both responsible and can think for yourself, since you made your own decision to put others first. Plus, you will always have another chance to become more independent, when the time comes.That, in itself, is being independent as well.
Nm4xYBhvaa	STOP!  Don't say or think anything about him  Just yet....  until you figure out if his actually has someone  ask him even if the conversation it kinda   awkward, you deserve to know!  But if he doesn't go out with him  and enjoy yourself...  But if he does take a load off.....  tell him your not gonna be whit him if he has someone else  don't sell yourself short for anyone!!  :]|`|ARCURrPhaa	You have a lot to learn about males. He wants to get laid!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Stay away from him he cannot be trusted.|`|IvMPh09baa	Isn't there a teenie-bopper section this question would be better in.|`|S318F1ocaa	he's a man. men want many women. all women. all the time. perhaps you could be that someone special amongst many?|`|AA11319441	Go over to singles and dating, kid.  This is for the adults.  We don't want to hear your teeny bopper drama here.
29i2Oo8Xaa	Not at all! You guys are bgf, not bfs. i doesnt matter if u have a bf or not.|`|vGHExDOzaa	Tell your bf to drop it and introduce them so he knows what is going on and if it was me i would say i will delete as soon as all your female friend numbers are gone and then leave it but still talk to your friend and yes most of my homework convos last 30min bc they have to explain it in detail cause i zone out|`|XGZBEdAWaa	Your boyfriend is over reacting, tell him there is nothing wrong with having a guys number on your phone, it's not like he's an old boyfriend or anything.  If your boyfriend has lots of girls numbers ask him why the double standard? tell him if he wants you to erase your friends number the he has to erase all of the girls numbers you don't approve of on his phone.|`|daoFR48xaa	If he has female friends then u should b able 2 have guy friends. There is no reason with that.
hMbvWc7naa	Of course you did the right thing. You were only trying to protect the girl you love. I think that it was actually really sweet for you to do that. Even though your detention is longer than that bullies, just loo down on him for lying and cheating by not serving a longer time than what you have to endure. Talk to the girl next time and say how you feel.    I hope that this really helped!!! > . |`|ZyjqjNn5aa	Just by reading the question, I was like "Wow, this kid is smart!"  I have punched a lot of kids...but im a girl. I only smack or punch people if they are annoying or messing with my friends, or being mean to me.  I'm Asian too. People make a lot of jokes because of my heritage. So, I do whats right.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	hell yeah you did the right thing!  fight for your woman!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think you did the right thing, man and I admired your courage.  This boy has no right to do that and to me, it looked like you proved that you care about this girl.|`|AA11100368	damn straight|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Yes you did! Bravo young man!    If there was any justice in the world, you'd be sent home with a ribbon!    The reason there are men who abuse and hurt women is because there aren't enough of us good ones who will stop them. Courage and morality must always be exercised when the immoral attempt to control others.    You stepped in and did that boy a big favor. For the cost of a little nosebleed and some embarrassment, you've corrected his actions and taught him to be careful with what he says to women.    Now, there are all kinds of nonsense you'll be likely to hear in the next few days. You teachers, your counselors, maybe even your parents are going to try to make you ashamed of what you did.    DON'T BELIEVE THEM!    What you did was both justified and correct. Cracking that jerk in the face showed you have your priorities straight.    You weren't afraid for yourself (or at least more than you were concerned for the girl)  You weren't afraid of the school (screw em....where the hell were they?)  You recognized that this girl needed your protection (selflessness)  And you recognized that this kid didn't need another lecture (too many in schools) but that he needed to FEEL like he was making this girl FEEL (overpowered and helpless)    So, stick to your guns. Don't be worried about reprisals. And if, tomorrow, you see this senario again, punch that kid in the nose too!    Good Luck! Good Job!|`|AA10471659	Yes and no. Yes the a** got what he was asking for, But, Some people are afraid of depressed people on drugs. They think you will flip out and hurt someone, now do you see?. You should talk to her and tell her that He had no right to treat Her like that, and you were not real angry except he went too far. Hey 8th graders fight more than any other class It's the hormones that make you touchy about fools with big mouths. Just tell her you were not out of control. you just wanted to stop his big mouth. I'm on anti-depressants, and know that you don't get that mad at people, but there is that image to overcome.|`|6t76bgS3aa	Yeah man, undoubdtedly.  That's awesome!  Way to go|`|1hinQlz2aa	Awesome !|`|YvZKd1ycaa	well, i would have appreciated it.  idk about her, i'm not shy or anything, but that's better than just standing there watching|`|NqMmvvgVaa	It's great that you stuck up for her. But you could have dealt with it by just talking to the guy, instead of showing you have a violent side. I bet she was flattered, but some girls might be turned off by seeing the violent side.|`|hnwMC1XQaa	yes you did. good job :)|`|ep8iy5YNaa	omg your so sweet! yes you did the right thing! Never mistreat a woman,nor stand around and let it be done. im sure she really appriciated what you did for her. On behave of all the girls you are a hero! well done!|`|N9HMovQ9aa	I really,really,really admire you I mean screw "violence is not the answer" that was amazing. You stood up for her and gave the boy what was was coming at him. People may say that you should have just talked to him, but what would that do!! Good job i i will pray for you....and that girl ;) if you know what i mean  luvs ya!  -ME|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	hell yeah! you fu.cking rule dude!!!!! I wish a guy would have stood up for me when i had bullies on me!    Rock on, she'll remember that, I promise you!|`|ZllkWRIOaa	you did the right thing but that dumas is just..|`|pCYyzYklaa	hell yea-simple as that|`|mDJInjEaaa	ha omg yes i am a gurl and if someone wld have done that for me i wld have loved him lol|`|ELVAZMY4aa	I think he deserved to get slugged!|`|BWgV2xSZaa	Yes you did. What else would you have done? Say "Stop it?" He would've provoked a fight. Hats off to you.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Yes!    I am of Chinese descent and have had many times, as a child, been racially harassed in school. I'm so proud of you for standing up for what's what. Sure you did get a detention, but think of it this way -- you're a good person in my book. I'm sure in her eyes you are a VERY GOOD PERSON. No person should be made to do someones homework, I don't care who he/she is. Ugh, whatever. He is a loser, you are a good person.    Good Luck!|`|VALxlwYSaa	Yes and no.   By sticking up for her you showed that you really care about her and you think she's special enough to punch someone in the face for :D     But you have to watch that sometimes, even if the guy was a jerk, the girl could get scared by your outburst.     Next time comfort her and tell the guy off. Only get physical if he does first.     Me, personally. I would have hit the guy myself. But, when you see her next you should talk to her and tell her your sorry about what happened. If she asks why tell her because it wasn't like you to get so worked up but you hated to see her hurt.     Good luck :D     P.S Good hit x]|`|HeOwMaxaaa	WOHOOO NICE! that was so great and manly of you!  that was really sweet.. that asshole guy deserved it!    P.S  your sexy...|`|38yInS5caa	Hell yeah! I Would've done the same thing!    Seriously though, maybe you could've handled it differently. Don't provoke him, try to stay calm ask him to stop. Since obviously he's too much of a jerk to stop, then he'll most likely make the first move. Since there were many witness' around you can then punch him in the face (maybe not the best choice but I would've! That dude was a jack ***!). If you get detention, get some students that witnessed what happened and you'll have it straightened out in no time.    As for the girl. Since she was being bullied by this kid, you probably did the right thing. She seemed shy and might've even been impressed by what you did. Surely she knows how much courage it took for you to punch him. Try to talk to her about it. See what happened.|`|NUvu9vMDaa	i would say so, but violence is never the answer. you did the right thing by taking action because the bullying may have become worse.|`|FxpE8ivMaa	good man. he learnt his lesson. if he pulls **** like that again bust him in the face, its 8th, do it while your still a minor. Nice going kid!|`|CpoPZaQTaa	i think you did the right thing.  if i were the girl i would feel safe around you.  also, give her time to start getting used to being around you.  if everything fails. maybe u guys aren't meant for each other.|`|U36GI9FUaa	you did fine bro keep that up making sure your girl is safe is awesome also i had the same problem except instead of detention i was in the trash can.so you think you could teach me to punch that hard.|`|AA11289793	Yeah! I wish I had the courage to do something like that when I was younger! She is defiantly going to notice you now!    Your detention is longer because you were the one that initiated the violence, so you would expect that because teachers are only doing their job and they have to be seen as not having a bias towards one student or another.    Just try talking to her now and see if she is okay after the other day...|`|2XNVys7Eaa	OH YEAH!Way to go dude!That boy sounded like a b*tch.Nice!Fight for your lady!Who cares about detention!?|`|caArlzCvaa	lol wow,    i hope that taught him a lesson, but u would of reported him instead.    or would of told the girl to report him becuase he was trying to forcce her to do his work.|`|uSatToqdaa	well honestly i think it was pretty brave, but you should also try to control your anger. i'm sure she appreciate you defending her, but you also could have just walked away and made sure she knew that what the other kid said wasn't true. that kid's just young and immature and probably needed some spanking when he was younger, but you shouldn't feel too badly about it. i don't know what i would have done if iwere in your shoes but next time just try to walk away.|`|5PcMA84Zaa	Your a great guy who has compassion!!!|`|wWzO9xARaa	That was really nice of you to stick up for her like that.|`|DeObHL9Oaa	You go boy! Standing up for the chica that you like, its so sweet, hope you are happy with her!      with |`|j7f6C4Bcaa	I think you did the right thing, but maybe next time you should express what you think without violence. But i think that guy deserves it, because he went too far.    Good job for standing up for the girl, it is clear that she can't defend herself   100%  and is lucky to have someone to help her through it.|`|qeS8A6hXaa	Thats badass. nice going. He deserved, and you did the right thing|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Whoop whoop! I always say that if someone made fun of someone i know i'd stand up to them and do some pretty bad things but i never have the courage to and you did so 10 thumbs up for you...never mind make that 2 i got thumbs and fingers miixed up or is it 8 since thumbs are different? lol i should ask that question. anyways good job!|`|TXNjM1qDaa	HAAAAAAAA!! =) lol that's good for him!! You did the correct thing. You taught him a lesson to stop being a jerk! i'm proud..i mean yeah you got detention but it will be over and you got the idea of correcting the idiot! WAY TO GO!!|`|VYMxtHpoaa	That... was beautiful. |`|oJNYLa8Iaa	This stuff is one of the things I hate MOST about school.  You punched him in the face for a good reason!  He was calling her racist things and everything.  He's a total ******* idiot.    How could teachers say you did the wrong thing?  Wait; did you tell them what he said an stuff to make you punch him in the face?  Well; idk; But if you did and you're detention is longer than his; than that is fucked up.      You did the rightt thing.  ((:
RC5L6AEhaa	if you are going to break up with her then just break up with her|`|f2hfuMKFaa	Dick in a box!!!|`|RAVTTlO4aa	make a card for valentines day...|`|ewQDWKp0aa	1.Be friendly.  2. Make sure they like you.|`|AA10286634	Most guys break up before Valentine's day so they don't have to worry about a gift.  If you must, make sure it's breakable.  One of those blown glass sculptures from the county fair would be nice.|`|49f6cbd2686a9cc3b76dbadb4c520e99aa	ok well if you want to be nice then i say then get her a present then but since she doesn't like Chocolate then get her something she does like. But i'll help you with that question later on but first i want to know when are you planing to break up with her? sorry but just asking. Anywho well get her a teddy bear get her something like take her out to the movies or something nice.|`|SSM8aV5Uaa	G3T H3R A T3DDy B3AR|`|GhETSRdUaa	Teddy bears and roses never ever fail.    Go to the dollar store, and pick her something out from there.|`|6OIK5RsQaa	ok...if your breaking up with her not a good idea! she will be even more hurt...and might throw it in your face...|`|yGq981mGaa	GIVER HER THE AXE|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Don't lead her on by getting her a present. If you're going to break up with her, just do it. It's less painful that way.|`|Q7WC6R0saa	ok so chocolate is out of the picture. well usually when you give someone a gift for valentines day that means you like her/love her. But if you are planning to break up with her. do it before valentines day. but not like the day before.  But if you want to give her something. Give her something you made or wrote. because that means you took time to make her something that shows you care. or wrote something which means the same thing. but yea good luck with your break up(if you do break up).|`|WDPYV5SRaa	get her a stuffed animal and tie a ribbon around it's neck saying something like "I want you to know that I value you as a person, as well as a good friend. I don't think we're right for each other in ways beyond friendship, but I hope we can continue a casual relationship."    or something.. idk. that sounded kind of lame. sorry.|`|CpoPZaQTaa	try getting her some flowers.  maybe even write her a poem.  You can take her out for dinner,or movies.  if this doesn't help try asking one of you buddies.  or you can ask one of her friends.  hope this helped :)|`|ApnV9ePZaa	Pink/Red Roses + A Plushy Of Her Favorite Animal! :D|`|TfzzhYUXaa	Don't get her anything. DUH!|`|H5iSiuVbaa	honestly i think you should break up with her before valentine's day. but be sweet about it! you know, let her down gently, if that's really possible.|`|9f76528c25ee8989980872c5f0d0892caa	get her a cute stuffed animal. and btw the worst gift u could give her would b to break up with her b4 valentines day.|`|TbSsvzRqaa	if your going to break up with her then break up but if you dont get her a rose for valentines day get her only 1 rose|`|23JV37Ptaa	check ebay!    keep in mind that it needs to be here by valentines day so get the shipping close by.  also, look for something you know she likes like jewelryy... or you could just get some roses.  my boyfriend and i have been strong for almost three years and he has pleased me with roses... and heisn'tt the richest guy... do some research for a goof florist!!!|`|hxNnKKAuaa	ok well first of all, that situation sucks  second, get her a stuffed animal or something, not too big or lovey dovey or anything cus then she'll think you're really interested in her  and third, do NOT break up with her on valentines day  dunno if that helps lol but i tried!|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	Wow, well you could get two movie tickets ( that new movie new in town)  and a card, and see if she invites you. And if she doesn't invite you then just move on because she just might not be worth it.|`|TQwhJSpraa	by her a single red rose kiss her on the cheek and then tell her she's beautiful but we've drifted apart :)    chessy i know but it just might work :3|`|NMihu3kgaa	Get her some flowers and a card. That is simple but thoughtful. But why would you want to get her anything? That would be like leading her on to think that you like her because you are getting her something. If you know that you are going to break up with her just do it now before valentines. The longer you wait the harder it is going to be.|`|1Bd3oWE9aa	well i think its really sweet that you care about her... even though she's not your type... as far as the gift goes... you could get a teddy bear and let it represent the 'friendship' you two will always have...    you seem like you are going to give someone a lovely bf when you're find her...    good luck dear...|`|IHT1QGzoaa	Girls are very sensitive and i've been in a position similar to this    But you have to be confident with your self if you don't want to hurt her feelings to bad. So here's what you do.    On valentines day get her a nice card that explains your feelings in a nice manner why you want to break up with her.     Then get her a box of chocolate's in a heart box and say take this as my final gift to you as you open this heart I want you to open up your heart to accepting us being just friends and seeing new people    works every time|`|SRFfaKbCaa	I think the longer she's with you the closer she'll feel for you and it'll be harder on her if you wait..I think you shouldnt' lead her on and tell her NOW and this way she can spend Valentines Day with someone who wants to be with her and you can spend it with someone you care for..then again I believe people should wait before clinging onto another|`|lqgxr5o7aa	Well i think that if you are planning on breaking up with her, you probably shouldn't get her anything for Valentine's Day because that would just confuse her and make things sooo much harder.  trust me.  but if you really do want to get her something, i would say something like her favorite movie or a nice shirt would be a suitable gift.  you definitely don't want to get her anything like a stuffed animal or chocolates or anything because if she's not confused by the fact that you're buying her anything at all after breaking up with her, buying something sweet like that would definitely confuse the heck out of her!  so just try to keep it general.  but i think that if you care about her enough to still buy her a present for valentines day, maybe you should give it a little time.  you obviously have SOME feelings for her.  and you haven't been together all that long so you could get to know her even better and find out that you really do care for her even more than you had originally thought!  if she's acting different then that probably means she is just nervous or really shy.  wait until she gets to be completely comfortable around you and starts to act like herself and not be shy.  you'll know when she is completely comfortable around you because she will at times act like a complete idiot in front of you because she knows that you are not judging her.  even if she says she is comfortable, she may not be so just wait it out.  you never know, something great could come from this!!!    good luck!!  hope this helped!(:|`|JQgXCGddaa	Have you picked a bad month to break up with her. I suggest not giving her anything because that just seems a little hypocritical of you. Personally if a guy broke up with me around this time then I would've just throw the gifts on him or not even want it because what's the point? Valentines day is suppose to be a day for liking to be around that special someone and a good gift which is kinda like a thank you but obviously you don't so break up soon to get it over with and don't give her anything.
GWRP3vLQaa	You need to get some counseling to deal with all of your losses and grief and find out why you don't feel as though you deserve to be happy. Your bf sounds like a keeper, and you should do everything you can to make sure that you can keep on being happy. I think you BOTH deserve it!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	You are very fortunate to have found a man that actually cares for you this much.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	OKAY you have posted this question before..  honey just go for this lovely guy he is for you  grab the chance dont think and ..start a new life..|`|IvMPh09baa	this was too long to read.    but to answer your first question... not as perfect as me. :)|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Looks like he is fully committed to you.  It's not a good thing.  You should not be 100% of his world and vice versa because this type of relationship would be too fragile like a glass house.   I am afraid that if you two for some reason don't get married, he will literally go crazy.  This is a relationship that requires a lot of care and work, mostly from you.  You have to be in the driver seat at all time.  In my opinion of course.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	Just remember nothing is guaranteed in life, so if he appears to you to  be the one for you, then maybe he is , then maybe not. Again life  is about taking a chance, and because no one can predict the future  then no one can say what will be.  In this instance go with your gut  feeling and if at the end it does not work out, then it is not the end of  the world and deal with it with support of the family and friend and keep  going forward, not matter what, good luck.|`|AA11319441	You ask this question WAY too much.  You sound neurotic.|`|7cjqT33Baa	It doesn't sound too perfect, it just sounds like a good relationship with a lot of potential.  It's kind of a red flag sign though that you broke up with him after a loss.  What is that about?  Have you had counseling for what your issue was then?  I don't understand how it was linked that you had to break up with him.  With all the loss you've experienced, it would seem like you'd want to focus on the here and now and appreciate what you have and just enjoy it.  It does sound like you have some issues you need to work out though.|`|RdHED7Yhaa	There are no perfect relationships but when you find someone that is in your corner even when you are acting like an a_ _ . I think you need to wake up and smell the roses and that what you have right now. MILDRED is my leader.|`|7Dd8CVf3aa	Okay.  Yes, you are oe of the luckiest girls in the WORLD!  Don't feel like you don't deserve it because you've obviously been through alot.  I don't know how to let him know you wan to marry him but seriously: you're 25 and you're asking about your boyfriend on YAHOO ANSWERS!!!!  Weird.  Any ways, I would kill to be you when I'm 25.  I'm sorry about your parents and brother and everything :'(|`|uvzuk10Eaa	just ask him already live a happy life together what you have is so beautiful and rare
ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	"Its better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all".  I say this man needs to be snatched up right now before some other woman comes along and steals him away.  You can't live your life being afraid that something bad is going to happen.  My husband is a retired cop who made it through his 25 years of service only to have a stroke 2 years after retirement.  He is doing okay, but will never be what he was before.  Does that change my love for him?  Nope.  I did need to get used to my "new" husband, but once I got over myself and learned to accept what happened, I was okay.  There is nothing wrong with being happy and you should not be afraid or scared.  Tell that man you want to marry him and do it at the first possible moment.  Live each day as if it were your last and don't look back.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i'm sorry for all of your losses. you've been through a lot for 25! just tell him that you're ready to get married. don't be worried about what COULD happen. enjoy this time you have with your boyfriend and loved ones. it's what life is all about.|`|pMsMx817aa	hmm  ive answered this question the last billion times you've asked this...|`|MWHJqVavaa	Do something really romantic for him, maybe for valentine's day. Just out of the park amazing! And you could always ask him to marry you, I don't know how you feel about that, but it is 2009. :) Good luck!|`|ICLekd2Vaa	after all hes done if you dont marry him ill divorce my great husband and demand this guys number!!
JbVyFcJjaa	If thet were really good friends, they wouldn't be ignoring you. Maybe one of them got mad at you, and she told the other ones to ignore you because SHE was mad and wanted to hurt your feelings. so try texting or calling on of them and simply ask why she/he is ignoring you, that is the only way you will be able to fix the problem. It hurts a lot to be ignored, try and make other friends, and then they will come crawling back to you if they see that you don't need them anymore.     Hope this helps!|`|PBe2qbXNaa	do you think they dont like you?......you can either improve yourself or find a new friend...|`|LYVDtbFZaa	Try talking to just one of them (pick the one who you think will e the most likely to forgive you for whatever it is you did-if you don't know ask) and if that doesn't work try giving them a cooling off period and try again, maybe once they calm down they will forgive you
RQD7Z0eXaa	Don't do anything.  Just relax and forget about it.  I know how hard that sounds, but really, what else can you do???  Move on, chill out, and forget about.  Like that song says..."Don't worry, be happy." :)|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	You dont need to explain to them, and if they ask you could say you were testing an experiment for science. or you needed to wear a diaper for something in school, and you were practicing and water spilled on you.|`|3LIW9PhNaa	WOW!!!!!!!!!! sorry. i would just let it go.
yhgRaBPXaa	I actually wore mine in the left and switched the band over when the ceremony was over. My mom gave me an heirloom ring to wear on my wedding day, so my right hand wasnt free. Its up to you what you want to do. No one will even notice.|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	It's not a dumb question if you haven't got married before how do you know what to do?   I wore mine on my right hand till after the ceremony & just before the photo's were taken.    Congrats. hope you have a lovely day.|`|PBdPD748aa	yep i was wondering the same thing lol im like how the hell does that work considering the wedding band goes on first!    well i just went to a cousins wedding recently and she wore it on her right ring finger at the ceremony, so he could slip her wedding ring on then they put the engagement ring back where its meant to be soon after :)|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i didnt. i was 8 months pregnant and it didnt fit, but i dont think its needed|`|2GfdpBKuaa	I had my mother hold it for me until after the wedding. Then put it on with my band.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	No, it's not dumb question.  It's a very common question.    There are 3 different things you can do:  1. wear it and the just invert the bands after the ceremony (since the wedding band goes closest to the heart, and under neath the engagement ring)  2.Wear it on the right hand during the ceremony and put it back on the left after.  3.  Hand it to your maid of honour during the ceremony and have her hold it until after.    I'm sure there are are a million other things you can do with it, but these are what I find to be the most common 3.  For me, I'll just put it on the other hand.  If I remember. lol.  I'm sure it'll be the last thing on my mind that day.|`|KT8RatG1aa	It is certainly correct to wear your engagement ring on your left hand, even through the ceremony.The wedding ring will be placed on your left ring finger in front of your engagement ring.  If your wedding ring is a diamond with a guard on it, your engagement ring would be worn on your right hand if you wish.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Yes, and then he put my wedding band on.  I wasn't allowed to wear that one until the wedding, obviously, lol.|`|NDEjwn6gaa	yes|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I did. I put it on my right hand third finger until the wedding ring was put on then I put it back on my left hand on top of my wedding ring.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I wore it on my right hand and switched it over to the left after the ceremony. I think many brides do this.|`|56vgx4ehaa	I am getting my rings sautered together so I will be without my engagement ring for a few days while that is happening. When I get my wedding band, it will have my engagement ring with it as well!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	There are different customs with people. Some only wear their ring on their right hand until you officially become married-then they move it to their left hand.    I think it's best to take it off-because it's supposed to be on top of the wedding ring.|`|cJCLNtc1aa	i wear mine on my right hand until we got married then i put it back on my left.    have fun and good luck|`|E7LQp6VRaa	I plan on wearing mine on my right ring finger until after the ceremony, at which time I will put it back on my left...

0Id85yiYaa	wine. you can get bottles for as low as $4 if you buy in bulk.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Non alcoholic sparkling drinks would be nice with hors oeuvre's.   Whilst eating you would normally have white or red wine on the table/s as not everyone wants to drink beer or water.  You generally have a sparkling wine for toasts too (can be either non alcoholic or alcoholic).  If you have ppl travelling from other areas it may seem a little strange just to serve beer & water.   Good luck|`|YgggHhwuaa	You could offer wine. Passing it will cut down on consumption too.|`|qybtMl3Jaa	Iced tea? and there are many flavors, you could offer one or two!|`|61L9P2tQaa	gatorade and juicy juice. damn thats the good stuff|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I'd say wine, or maybe just coffee or soda (if you don't want to be buying a lot of wine)  Since you have a keg that means the beer is in a glass. I think you are fine serving that with dinner.  It's not like there are going to be bottles.  That might not be so elegant. lol  I think you are good with beer, water and maybe some wine options.  If not wine,then definitely have coffee, tea or soda available.(not just for dinner but the whole night)  Offering people only water or beer is a little TOO laid back.  You need to give your guests a few options.  Or maybe some juice, apple, orange.  Not too expensive.  Good luck!|`|1BgdsSG2aa	For an inexpensive non-alcoholic option, I would suggest sparkling cider.  There are several different brands on the market, and an ever expanding choice of flavors.|`|4UUVrWXtaa	I think you should offer coffee and tea, you can also give them soft drinks (not soo fancy, but everyone drinks them), iced tea,  and Sparkling Cider can never go wrong, is non-alcoholic, and not so expensive..  Congratulations...  ohh if you are offering water..  lots of people like mineral like Pellegrino, but i don't know if is expensive..
oEYrC1Wsaa	It means that $65.00 is the total price you have to pay.  If the quote said exclusive you would have to add 22% service tax & the applicable sales tax whatever that is so the price would be more than $65.00.  Hope that helps.|`|qybtMl3Jaa	Inclusive does mean included!|`|PBdPD748aa	it means that the 22% service charge and tax is part of the $65 so you do not need to pay any extra    it is a package price so to speak|`|JtEBaOdjaa	the 22% is tax and the $65 is already including the tax.  Meaning it won't be added on top of that.|`|0Id85yiYaa	it means that tax is included in the price
bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	Sometimes with family you can only do so much. Your sister sounds like she needs help but you can't make her and your Mom or Dad can't either. So that leaves you where you are now. Not so great but it's not your problem. You can't save your family or your sister. Just live your life and hope your sister will see it's the better way to go. Try positive renforcement. Don't talk about her problems. I'm sure she knows what they are. Try and boost her confidence by the your confidence you have for her. Bring her opportunities that will improve her self-esstem and get her out there to live life and see what a great life you can have if you only try. Good luck.|`|6AvvxvAqaa	you can have your mom go to Alenon (spelling probably wrong)...it is for the addict's relatives/significant others, or yourself and sister, you might get ideas here...this might help your realize she is eanbling your father and in turn stop that and than get your sister help...just try talking to your sister little by little, not really prying or throwing any ideas at her just listen and make suggestions...relate it to something you have done in life or a problem you had...this way she feels equal becasue you had a simialr problem
fxH6T7vCaa	Depends on the person or how it makes them look, but I would rather have close together eyes, then really far apart eyes! I guess the aren't really that bad.|`|wvPDo4gXaa	no.. but mine are not ..|`|RC5L6AEhaa	i don't know it all depends if it goes with the rest of the face|`|F2jBt40Xaa	what|`|TYl7kmPeaa	only if its disproportional to the rest of the face|`|cb5522ea5bac3ee4d8f1779895290ac6aa	I don't really care.  It's what's on the inside that counts, well at least for me.|`|q2POh1dEaa	yes
AA10743159	If he doesn't reach out for  your hand, reach out to his hand with yours.  That way, it won't be on him, having to put himself out there, if he's shy. I am sure,  he will hold your hand, if it's offered to him.    As to the kissing on St.Valentine's Day, it's a day for lovers, which you two aren't as yet. So if you aren't comfortable kissing him yet, then just give him a hug and kiss on the cheek.|`|swJuTXcSaa	Check your pocketbook not missing.|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	Sounds like a good time. Grab his hand and kiss him.|`|vGHExDOzaa	Um girl if it was me i would tell him he can not kiss me till he holds my hand and shows interest in me and yes he is nervous but say what you want and you will get it|`|BM1GgcnMaa	i had the same problem, You need to make the first move on the hand holding thing because guys are really dense and don't catch hints as easily as you would like them to. as for the kissing thing if you don't feel ready than you need to talk to him about it and let him know how you feel. If you do feel ready you need to make that first kiss count. Good Luck.|`|OnmB1OEKaa	i think you should let him kiss you on valentines day  and its okay if he doesnt want to hold  ur hand yet never froce a person to do something they  dont want to. the right time for it will come soon
AA12198711	The definition of respect is the acknowledgment that someone or something has value. This gets to the point of the fact that while we may not always agree with someone or what they say, but we must always respect what it is that they say. How should you go about showing others respect? There are several simple things that go a long ways.    Make eye contact Make eye contact Be attentive to what they are saying. Make eye contact with them when they are talking and don't be day dreaming. Eye contact is the best way to show interest.    Be fair toward the other person. Many times we unfairly judge another person or their views and don't show them the respect they deserve.    Give them time to say what it is they want to say. One of the best ways to show no respect whatsoever is to rudely cut in while the other person is speaking. Allow them their time and you are likely to get yours as well.    Be sensitive to their thoughts and feelings. Just as you would want others to show some sensitivity toward the things you feel strongest about, you must do the same to others.

zzUgYFy4aa	your dream has nothing to do with SEX    you have a fear of losing control.. you are scared of something in your life that requires immediate attention
1ZT39UkWaa	My long term bf has behaved like that before    I was that horrified i was shocked into silence, but the best thing i did was to eventually sit down and explain to him how much the comments he made hurt.    Turns out my bf was feeling rather insecure about a comment someone had made in his family. Maybe you husband is the same, he might just be shaken up over something    hope everything goes okay!  x|`|IvMPh09baa	so you've hit your first argument after marriage...     trust me, there will be many many arguments... just blow this one off, say your sorry and move on.  Pick your battles... just let this one go.|`|0ylm04PWaa	You shouldn't be having trust issues like that so early on. Did your husband know about your friend? If not, then I could see why he might have acted that way.|`|7cjqT33Baa	he's feeling jealous, threatened and insecure.  It happens, especially when the relationship is still kind of new and things aren't established.  Just talk to him, say you married him, you love him.  That your friends are important to you, but he is your man and he has nothing to worry about.  But also don't let him start bullying you out of your other relationships.  It's important to keep those solid.  If you've reassured him and he still is acting that way, you guys really need to talk that out because it isn't healthy.  I wouldn't have a problem with my husband answering my mobile phone any more than I would my house phone.  What is there to hide?  What if he didn't want you talking to someone on his phone, that would seem kind of fishy.|`|saXJp2Ncaa	cool|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Your husband Sounds insecure and threatened by the friendship you share with Todd.  he may even be fearing that you and Todd are more than just friends or at least have the potential to be?  I would tell your husband that he should trust you and tell him firmly not answer YOUR mobile otherwise you will start answering his mobile.    If he starts getting too possessive then you will need to decide if being with him is worth it?
XulcYwOnaa	don't ask the teacher because that won't work. but yeah, you have a pretty big chance. in the beginning of last year, my future girlfriend was pretty quiet in class and i was a loud guy. my friend invited her to our lunch table and we started talking and we hit it off perfectly. and a year later, we're the most serious couple in our grade. so to answer your question in a short way, you got a good chance, just say something to him after calls or lunch or something.|`|A7nIADxgaa	Don't ever talk to a teacher about it. I know a friend of mine who did, and the teacher ended up asking the guy to give her a chance. No need to say she was humiliated. Try talking to him, can't go that bad.|`|vjnUENK0aa	maybe hes showing off to try to get your attention. lol|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	yeah, definitely ask for a seat change. If you feel really brave, ask if he likes you through a note.    Good Luck! :)|`|5E4t2xqNaa	You're trying to hard... stop making yourself so available to him - guys enjoy a challenge. Just say something to him... after class ends.|`|cl83KGQoaa	This probably doesn't help at all, but I LOVE shy girls!!!    I'm a very shy guy though
AA12250406	Ada.. Listen to me very carefully. After hearing how your husband is so controlling and how he doesn't have a job and treats you so bad and you putting up with it as well as you being the only one who works. Do yourself a great favor and get rid of this toxic waste of human flesh. KICK HIM OUT!! He doesn't deserve you!!  ANd you don't need someone like him!! GO back to Hans, He is the only one that has brought you so much joy. How long will you deny yourself of happiness and how long will you take this abuse. LEAVE HIM!! Hans is better as a friend,companion and lover from what you wrote about him. DO it for yourself! A married woman CAN have male friends and enjoy life, A married woman is NOT a doormat. Please listen to me and your family and friends....Leave this guy and find true happiness in your friends especially Hans for he has been with you all your life. Good luck my german friend. My wife also says for you to leave ahmed.    P.S As soon as you divorce him...don't let him stay at your house.|`|t0uIgY08aa	leave.... he has no respect for you|`|plBXp91Daa	Did you ever tried to talk with your husband about getting a job?So yes what did he said?And if you don't want to live with him anymore and your feeling for him is gone i would end the marriage and move on what he do that is his problem. Because he didn't care to search for a job or take care for you like a real man should do. And another thing.. if you going to divorce him i would take it slowly and don't jump into another relationship.|`|GmTs1BB1aa	if you're even questioning it then yeah|`|uvzuk10Eaa	stand up for yourself and tell your husband that you need to have your own time to do stuff he needs to help with the house work he has no job what does he do all day? i think there is an issue of trust here with him not trusting you he thinks you are sleeping around so you need to nip it in the bud now rather than later dont lose your freindships with hans fritz and otto they sound great|`|vwcDdNfcaa	screw that kick his butt out|`|9463fac7b3034dd922bb76c0276e71c6aa	Well it appears that he has reason to be upset about the other guys that you are "friends" with. So that is a valid point. You should respect your husband, these other men are helping your marriage fail.     As for the rest of it, if he is not a supportive partner to you in every way a husband should be, emotionally, spiritually and sexually then it is time to have a talk and let him know how unhappy you are, he might be as well. And he might very well choose to leave on his own or try to change his behavior. If he is not willing to hear your unhappiness or heartache then you might have to chalk this one up to being young and move on.|`|1a6a3af6da727166c63a917a0c6ce580aa	divorce him AND kick him out!|`|ubDQTBudaa	When your in a relationship with someone you suppose to compromise always . Don t leave your husband , try to work things out ........|`|AA11560508	I think you are more than sure of what you want to do. Divorce him, I just think you are looking for the reassurance so here it is. Divorce him and hook up with someone you really like.|`|kT5Bk0T8aa	in this life it take money to make it,thin to have control too I don't thank so,after marriage it don't look good to have mens friends it does kind of dis respectful,maybe if you lay some consquences on your husband about getting a job see if this will help|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	First off once you marry a man some of your old relationships( friends) you should be willing to let go. Especially if it makes you uncomfortable. When you marry you marry for better or worse. Second he ought to get a job talk to him let him know how you feel about it. Is it because you live in a small town and no one wants to hire him? He should be willing to let you hang out with your girlfriends on occasion. Now if you don't love him and you have doubt you prob shouldn't be with him. However you married him for some reason. Islamic men are controlling you should have know that from there culture. So are Russian men. Your male friends you can still be there friends but have them meet you at the pub when you work. They can order a drink and you can all chat and have a good time. with the exception of your ex He already told you he wants you in bed. You need to leave that alone. If the town gets wind you you might start being called a wh**re I am a man and get uncomfortable when a girl talks or hangs out with an ex. ( I also won't talk to my ex out of respect for her.) If you cant make it work tell him to leave get your friends to be there for support.Or protection if you are worried about that.
I814g6ZBaa	I like new purses... that should do the trick.  Thanks!!!  :)|`|hs793CCxaa	Stay away would be a good start.     She gets really annoyed with fleas like you.

dIxQ9rV5aa	Tell him that you don't even know who he is, and your heart isn't going love a complete stranger.  You need time to get to know him, and he should respect that.|`|vwcDdNfcaa	what is there to lose? it will be tuff but he is your birth father you dont have to love him but you do have to respect him enough to give him a chance. its not like he left once he found out hunny he just didnt know|`|utcnajvsaa	Your birth father probably expects you to be his "little girl" because he's your biological father. Clearly, you're your stepdad's little girl and that's perfectly okay. I think you should give your birth father a chance, but don't go too fast. Just start things slowly. If he hasn't been in your life until now, he shouldn't have this expectation.|`|jnfLQlvXaa	well... my friend had that problem...but she and her step-dad were already close... so she just said she didn't wanna see her dad cuz he's the one who betrayed her and her mom in the 1st place!
6J75ZxxHaa	I would wait until you guys are getting into the moment. Just warn her as the moment gets hotter, maybe when shirts start coming off. Hope everything goes well :]|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Make sure any woman you date has a big beaver.|`|J5Mevbz7aa	i think she'll notice when you..|`|N9HMovQ9aa	whoa never heard of a dilemma like that|`|ORTMJq0Saa	Go to the gym and that should solve ur problem|`|L44LBa2Xaa	Well, I hope you'd warn her.  But, if you just started to date this women, don't just go out of the blue and tell her what happened between your ex and the size of your penis until you get ready to go to the next level unless you just want her to think your in it for the sex.!  But if you guys end up talking about sex or/are starting to get freaky, then you should warn her at that point in time and not to put if off any longer    And I'm sorry to hear that you and her did break up for that reason|`|pQFENLOSaa	holly sh*t... um yes i guess|`|58EydBwwaa	Its called foreplay, honey. Lots and lots of foreplay. If a girl is turned on enough (preferably has an orgasm BEFORE sex) size won't be an issue.|`|JdG98dm0aa	First off dude you are the man to even admit that out in public. Second tell her and make sure she is ok with it before you do anything.|`|LGAIhRJ1aa	warn her tell her that you cant help it and yah dehh dahh. and if she still likes you good. =] good luck there.|`|zKZPpjtlaa	yes of course...if you really care about her then tell her!
A7nIADxgaa	Wait for them to break up, after that wait for a few weeks then tell her how you feel and ask her out. If it was long relationship you might wait a little more.|`|ITMUqdzOaa	chill man, a girl only needs one boy in her life at a time!!! give it time. see what happens.|`|58EydBwwaa	You can't love someone if they give you nothing in return. If she says she has a boyfriend she is not interested. Move on.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	if you're a teen, relationships never last that long.  when she's single go for it, until then you're going to have to love in silence. srry :(|`|2fG6NpUkaa	wait till she is done with him, give it some time. She may not want to jump right into another relash. so just go find another girl cuz ur wasting your time. you can always still be good friends with her. you just don't have to date her to love her....|`|J4brNd1Xaa	Just be yourself around her. You say you like her and she knows, so from there just be her friend, the best one you can be. She's bound to see the good in you at some point, if you love her as much as you say you do. Don't try too hard to break her relationship though, if you do you might end up wrecking any chance you could of had with her. Let her get to know you more, I'm sure she'll appreciate being loved for something apart from her looks.
IUSryVeeaa	Notice how you said "she seemed much more mature...." that is the thing here. In this day and age 16/17/18 year olds are applying make up like no tomorrow, trying to act the part of drinking at bars, all adult and basically just faking it till they make it. Once they make it, they can't handle the heat. This is what immaturity is. She is an attention seeker. Love is love and attention is attention. What is she asking you for? I believe it is the latter. I believe we have more than 1 love in this lifetime, so just accept that you did love her and care about her, but to be quite honest if the same care and love doesn't come in your direction, it is a no go zone. Girls at that age ARE just like that, we just deal with it. Wait till they grow up. 17 is at a mentality when it hasn't matured and it's the game playing time in our lives, we have all benn through it. Don't take it too seriously. I am now 22 and you grow up so much in the time from 17/18 to now even only after like 4 years. It just happens. It's how we're made. But if you don't want the game playing, find someone your own age.|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	bro she is 17 you 21 as you and everyone else can see she is very young    most 17 year olds and younger don't really know what they want and don't understan love     she is confuse   love is something someone feel by the way   if you did not know you know now and if she don't feel the love for you is because she don't love you           move on bro fine a girl your age|`|EdidZdtlaa	her maturity level needs get improved is what i have to say. also i dont think you should talk to her anymore if shes causing so much trouble in your life you know. anyone who causes trouble in your life you dont need them. unless its family you can work it out. but i wouldnt still talk to that person if i were you. even though i might have loved him i would have lost my cool really quick . you must have alot pf patience.|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	mature or not, you'd still go to jail for being with a minor.|`|6t76bgS3aa	Most of my exes would like me dead|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Sounds like she was tring to get you to commit or something when she broke up with you. I don't think she really wanted to lose you. She's just playing you with manipulation.|`|RqDgxhTHaa	o_o;;  Woww.  Tell her u've moved on and next time she calls. get mad, Like, really mad and shout at her. Girls get really creeped out when a guy shout at them. But after, they get grumpy and shout back. If u don;t wanna shout at girls then introduce her a new guy, like someone u know who wants girlfriend. But i really hope ur really moved on. When the girl is happy with another guy, and u still hasn't moved on, u get jealous. Oh, maybe she's jealous about u hanging with other girls. Although that's very imature. ha ha-  any how after that, look for new girlfriend who could help u get through(???) that.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	Girls are crazy that's why I don't date them. She 17 so she doesn't know much of anything so this crazy act she's putting isn't going away anytime soon. CUT HER LOOSE! Block her number and block her from your facebook or myspace b/c you don't need the added stress of an ex especially when she called it off. For the future try to date women and not girls.|`|67D1HgqVaa	well u cud get a restraining order if u want her away or u cud tell her straight up that u want her to stop and want to no wat she wants form u so i hope this helps i had a boyfriend and this same thing happent and i told him straight up and he finally stop after he told me that he really liked me so idk hope it helps|`|2XNVys7Eaa	whats her friggin' problem|`|rAQADfSvaa	Wow! This sounds like my past. Well, I'll tell you what you need to do, plain and simple. Lose her! Seriously. She broke up with you for a reason. Do you really want to hold on to someone that doesn't completely want you 100%? Someone that doubts that she's really that into you? I've been that girl, and I'll tell you - she feels an extraordinary amount of guilt for breaking your heart. The thing is, she doesn't know this is guilt, because it's deceiving and makes you feel like you really made a huge mistake and you need him back! Once she gets you back, the old feelings will set in again, and she'll be leaving. It's absolutely painful. I'd cut your ties with her now, once and for all. It's for your own best interest. Knowing that other girls are hanging off you are going to drive her NUTS! She'll get over it eventually..Trust me. Girls are complicated, don't stick with the ones that make it even more so. Good luck. Hopefully she'll truely grow up some day.
zzUgYFy4aa	no you should not text him.. that is STALKER LIKE    ask him for his number and then text him    do not be a weirdo
ppR5kH4Yaa	Contact the Cherokee tribe that issued the card.  Most DO issue replacements.|`|cer6YWt9aa	They usually do not reissue cards. My friend lost his also and his tribe sent him papers for proof. He located them locally on the internet, then went to the Indian hospital here and they were able to look him up and hook him up with what he needed. This was onlt about 3 weeks ago.  Best of luck!!
Mxq1NQJdaa	You have every right to call the police when he gets violent, regardless of who he is hitting.  If no one decides to press charges, they will release him but the offense has been documented.  Just keep calling the police when he gets physical.    In not doing anything, he believes there are no consequences for his behavior and that he is in charge of all the females in your houselhold.    Police dept can also put you into touch with an advocacy group....|`|AA10986891	WOW I know how you feel.

If your mother wants to live with an abusive man that is her choice but you shouldn't have to suffer for her weaknesses.|`|F0nkm4sTaa	DON'T PUT UP WITH THAT CRAP  You don't deserve that. Call the police straight away if he ever does it again|`|0udjgaoBaa	Your mom has low self esteem. You should try fixing her up and taking her out once she sees the different attention she may get the esteem that it takes to leave him....In regards to the hitting and what not Id call the cops on him every time annoymisly and have him arrested your mom will get tired of it and so will he. hope that helps.
dd6758a8f3576decb99f3b35a584b81eaa	Its understandable that you feel so low when your in that sort of situation, you just have to stay strong and remember that you're a good person, your boyfriend obviously loves you which shows you that you must be a likable person and that its your parents with the problem not you.  If you're have problems finding friends maybe ask your boyfriend to try and introduce you to some new people or as your parents don't let you out the house you could join facebook or something and try too reconnect some of your old friends or people at your college.  As for the parent situation, i dunno... you're just gonna have to try and ignore them and remember that you are a good person that doesn't deserve to be hurt by anyone, least of all by yourself!

otTslvAOaa	depends on how you mean stay in touch..... if they are now suppose to be your best friends.... calling you all the time.... forget it.    I hardly ever see the people who I preform weddings for afterwards.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah I've found married people just drop off the face of the earth.  it's even worse when they have kids.  married people don't hang out with singles for some reason, at least my married friends don't.  nor do they know any singles to introduce me to, just my luck.  I guess having a house, bills, job, in laws, husband and all these demands on your time makes you really busy but I don't get it because I'm an uber organized person.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	Sad, but, as we grow,sometimes people just don't stay in touch with one another. Some people use Christmas cards to keep in touch?  There may have been a 'common bond' that made you Friends to begin with but, not strong enough to 'stay' Friends.  I remember hearing my Parents say, "It's Strange the only time we see  old Friends is at Weddings or Funerals". Sad but, true.   Time goes on and people do Grow apart.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	there r ones whom think they r better then other don"t sweat it|`|woOeYFrEaa	Probably my worst experience with this was with a friend who got married.  I was a bridesmaid in her wedding and ended up needing to miss the rehearsal dinner because my dad was hospitalized.  I did make all the other wedding functions including the wedding even though I was worried sick about my dad.  She moved away right after the wedding and I never heard from her again.  I tried to stay in touch and shared the news that my dad had been diagnosed with cancer but I never got a reply from her over e-mail or otherwise.    I know she was busy with moving and ecstatic to be married, but it really hurt.|`|AA10211580	I attended my mom's cousins wedding 2 years ago and I tried to keep in touch with some of the relatives by email and they tried to reply but they seem so busy so I quit trying to keep in touch with them. I even tried to send the bride an email and christmas cards but she had moved after a year and so my christmas card came back to me.
18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Wow. this stinks.     But there's jolly nothing you can do about it.    So buy the dress you hate, get dolled up. Be gracious and kind and smile. Don't outdo the bride.    WHY? well, even though she deserves a good spanking and all that stuff, she is obviously the favorite and knows she can get away with her behavior.     And if you whine and fuss, all that will do is validate your lowly status in the family. So do what you need to do to maintain dignity - even if it's wearing a dress you hate and have to pay for.    Now then. Here's how you can upstage the bride - and the rest of your awful family.     Become a success.     Starting right now, make good grades. Study hard. Get a scholarship to a local 2-year nursing program and get your RN certificate. RN's make good money and they can go just about anywhere in the US and get a good job.    Once you get your RN license, move away from these horrible people as quickly and as far as you can. Oh, sure. Send cards and occasional letters. BUT DO NOT GO HOME for more than a couple of days - then beat it back to San Francisco - or Albuquerque or wherever your new home is.     Make friends there. Find a great guy who loves you for the loving caring woman you will become. Have a wonderful life.    And when your selfish sister has 5 children under 6, gets evicted because her husband is a womanizing, gambling drunk - just after she finds out that he has been keeping a mistress for the entire time they were married, you can think back and thank God there is justice in the world.     Ignore pleas for help from your beleagured parents who have bailed Sis out of a zillion problems because she can't stand on her own. Just tell them that is the price you pay for picking a favorite daughter and spoiling her like they did her.     Then you look at your wonderful, successful husband and tell him you are so glad he's in your life.|`|kDv1uC1raa	TRY TO GROW UP FOR JUST A DAY SINCE WEDDINGS ONLY COME ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND BIRTHDAYS HAPPEN EVERY YEAR!!! Maybe your parents have a surprise for you after, but if you acted like a spoiled little brat and I was your mother I would lock you in your damn room! You can celebrate your birthday the day before or after families make sacrifices to make each other happy... Sounds like you're a spoiled brat and need to  learn the world doesn't revolve around you!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Wow, aren't you nasty, spoiled, conceited little sister.  Pretty is as pretty does child.|`|N0k53aFzaa	Don't dress like a skank, because no one likes a skank.  Don't get too dolled up, because then it will look like you tried to hard.  Dress nice and look pretty like anyone would who is attending.    Sounds like your sisters is a little jealous, therefore taking it out on you the wrong way.  But don't make a big stink about it.  Because that will give her the satisfaction of knowing it bothers you.  I would pretend you don't care.  And once your wedding day comes, you can make it on her birthday if you really want.    Just don't make a scene or try to out do her, it will make no one other than you look bad.  It doesn't matter who the bride is or how much you don't like them, it is extrememly TACKY so try to outdo any bride.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Be the bigger person sweety, get the dress you like do your makeup nice and look pretty.

Might as well dress as your personality.|`|hwSBC3bZaa	i know most of these people are being totally rude but don't listen to them. i don't find you to be a spoiled brat at all. she could have chosen any day and she chose your special day as hers. you obviously had it first lol. i wouldn't try to outdo her but maybe u should talk to her about how u feel. and tell ur mom that if shes making you go then she has to pay for the dress. even legally she cant make you spend your money on anything that you don't want to since it belongs to her. the other girl was right too. try asking if u can celebrate ur birthday a few days before or after the wedding and tell them that it better be extra special. lol.    i know how you feel because my sis tried to destroy my 16th bday too. she convinced my mom to use the money that she was going to spend on my party on a new laptop that she broke on purpose. i ended up having tacos. hah. but seriously tell them how u feel and try to help them understand in any way you can.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	quit watching molly ringwald movies and do your homework.|`|4POGapREaa	As hard as it might be for a 16 yr old to do, just be the bigger person.  I understand that you think she's trying to cause drama with you, but you're not doing yourself any favors by reacting to it.  If you dress like a skank or try to outdo her, you WILL be embarrassed of yourself later on.  No ifs, ands, or butts about that one.  You can still have some class even if those around you have none.  It's not mandatory that you act like crap too.  Be bigger than that.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	im not even sure how to answer this....like, while it does suck that your sixteenth birthday is that day, its still completly crass and rude to try to upstage any bride.     i really dont know what to tell you....you say you have no choice in what to wear then why do you even ask us?|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Sounds like that 80's movie 'Sixteen Candles'.  Maybe if you watch it you'll get some ideas.  If this is a real question then do whatever you want since you are being forced to spend your own money.  Tell everyone it's your 16th birthday, wear a pretty dress, and ask for lots of presents from the wedding guests.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	You have a BAAAD attitude and I really hope you're a troll.  I'm not convinced this question is for real.      If you're not a bridesmaid, your sister has no say over the outfit you wear, other than not to wear something embarrassing or that shows her up.  If you decide for example to blow several thousand on a gorgeous wedding gown to show her up, YOU are the one who will look stupid.  If you wear a see-thru dress with a thong showing, again, YOU are the one who will look stupid.  Your plan to show her up will only backfire and call negative attention to yourself.    Wear a tasteful outfit and focus on something other than yourself that day.  You can celebrate your birthday on the other day of the weekend, or after the wedding if the wedding is in the daytime.|`|RDWVoc9Naa	ohhhh arent you just the brightest ray of sunshine !!!!      GROW UP.

Even though it might feel good to get a bit of revenge It's not really going to help your situation in the long run.      I have a younger sister and I would never even consider planning to have my wedding on her birthday. Especially her sweet 16th!  That wasn't really cool of your sister to do. But unfortunately it looks like this is going to happen whether you like it or not. You might as well try and have a good time.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Totally messed up. Look your absolute best, and tell everyone you meet that it's your birthday.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If you outdo her or dress like a skank, people will just think she has a sister who is either snotty or clueless.  It will reflect badly on you, not on her.  Could you see if your family would be willing to celebrate your birthday on another day, maybe a few days before or a few days after the wedding?|`|AA10975867	You are contradicting yourself. By the sound of your post, you are quite the self-centred, cranky little Miss. Your sister is the bride and she selected a dress. That's the bride's privilege. If the dresses are totally horrendous, people will talk about her poor taste - not about you. It probably isn't that bad, though, as your mother obviously approves as well. You hated it and will not cooperate so I can totally understand if they said "Fine, get your own dress and pay for it yourself!" That is how you talk to spoiled brats! If you dress like a skank, people will just talk about how bad you look, nothing to do with your sister. In fact, they will feel sorry for her for having such a rotten little brat for a sister and she will be loved even more. Why don't you try acting your age and behave yourself! Maybe if you behaved like a responsible, mature 16 year old, became cooperative and helpful, you would discover that the family really will be doing something special for your birthday - even if it's the next day! Wedding plans cause a lot of work, pressure, nervousness. Sisters who cause turmoil are not the most loved people! GROW UP!|`|jK9H6PHiaa	There is no way to upstage a bride. Dress your best and be classy about it people will a good side of you. Noone can upstage a bride, she has a glow to her, she's got the big white dress, and oh yeah its all about her.     If you dress skanky you will give people a reason to call you a whore to your face.     Believe me a 16th bday isn't that great. Maybe aim for 18 or 21 when you can atleast do something fun not sit around and drink club soda.     Grow up if you were my sister and acted this way you would be sitting home alone all buy yourself not trying to be a little ****.
iT3GOZwHaa	I'm sorry that happened to you. Since you were able to say no and leave, I don't think you can sue him or anything like that. However, you have a right to feel violated. If you think you can, you should talk to him about it and tell him how you feel. If that's out of the question, just stay away from him. Especially at parties/while drinking.|`|jfwmelYgaa	You could if you wanted...but that would be pretty harsh  to do to a guy that just wanted some action.|`|3zmC8AuDaa	Y'all were both drinking. Here is an equation to help you understand what happened.    Man+Beer=Stupid Horny Man  Horny Man+Drunk Girl=Opportunity to get laid.     You were making out with him and he tried for the next level. If he didn't pursue it, then he still respects you. You should respect him for that.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	Yes and buy a taser|`|rsAqrbsgaa	I think you just want that to happen to you.  Maybe you dreamed it.  It;s okay though, I dream like that sometimes too.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Just remember that He may have been drunk enough to try it but you were drunk enough to let it get that far.  I am not saying that it was your fault but I think you share in the guilt. You told him to stop and the situation was over with. If he had tried to force you to continue then yes you should press charges but from what you are telling us he did not.  It very well could be that you were giving him some indication that you were enjoying what was happening up to that point so he tried to take it to the next level.  You didn't want it to go there so you stopped it.  No crime.|`|AA12071655	You were both drunk, he made a pass, you stopped him, he took no for an answer and that was that. Your life is going to be full of such occurrences. Take some ownership: you were both drunk and you went with him to a secluded place. He wasn't sure of your intent so he tested the waters. No real harm, no real foul.    If a guy ever doesn't take no for an answer, THEN you have an issue.|`|AA11352641	I don't see where he committed a crime. Let go of it and just put it behind you.|`|F0nkm4sTaa	Just pretend that you were too drunk to remember|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Anything can happen when you are 'drunk'.  Keep in mind, he was also drunk.  He was into the moment and if you would have allowed it, he would have continued.  I don't know what you would expect.  You did make-out with him.......he was just pushing the ticket.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	You were both drunk and making out. No laws were broken, unless you or he are underage, and that would be for drinking. Just be smarter next time. There is no virtue in being drunk. Grow up and be responsible for yourselves. You are both at fault.
otTslvAOaa	get a couple of nice flower arrangements... for the sactuary.... in front of altar and pulpit.    use the churches candle abras, if they have them....... if not.... have a couple pedestals, along the back wall with smaller flower arrangements.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Ask what the church has that you could borrow.  You'd be shocked at what you might could borrow.  My church has tons of tables for events like this.  I used Christmas decorations to decorate the actual church.  It was an evening wedding and we have these tall candle...I don't know what to call it.  Poles that go on to the end of the pews that at the top have a hurricane glass and a candle.  I used those for my wedding.  They also had lots of glass hurricane globes they used for the windows that you could use as centerpieces.    Other things like marbles or candles for the table you could ask other brides.  I know for my wedding, I had 20 vases, tons of blue marbles, that I would have LOVED to loan to another bride or even rented for a cheap price.    Get flowers from Costco's/Sam's Club and arrange your own centerpieces.  I had their florist order the flowers for me and then I merely put 5-6 stems in each vase.  Another idea is to use glass bowls from your family and float one large flower in it.  A hydrangea or a sunflower works wonderfully.    Caterers can be cheaply as well.  Italian restaurants have family plates that feed 50.  BBQ is also a great cheap idea to feed a crowd.    Usually pavilions are easy to drape fabric from.  Get a bolt of sheer cloth at a fabric store and drape it around the pavilion.  Use some bright colors since it is outside.  You can also use a lot of natural items like leaves from trees or flowers grown in someone's yard.    Ask the church if they have previous brides that you could get recommendations on vendors from.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	The dollar stores have a lot of good items to help make things pretty, especially the big dollar stores.  You could make some of the decorations.  I'm sure there are tons of ideas online.  If you have any crafty friends you could ask them to help.|`|6s7g3X0maa	i am getting in may 2009 also and am on a budget. So we are getting married at a park. It will be cute though. We are getting married at an amphitheater where i get to walk over a tiny bridge and up onto a stage. then our reception is at a pavilion. I am going to be doing a lot of my shopping at dollar tree and stuff they have some good stuff there. also if you have a michael's in your town go there. It's a good place to go also hobby lobby. or try googling cheap wedding decorations|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	If you are a member of that church ask the ladies groups to help. You supply ribbon and such.    My friend searched threw the engagement announcements and called the brides-to-be. She asked to split the cost of some items and saved a bundle.    Also put a request on freecycle for decorations.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Honestly, don't worry about decorating the church-if anything, just a really beautiful floral arrangement for the altar. Your bridal party standing up there will "decorate" the church enough in photos. :)    For the pavilion, go online and find some cheap lanterns you can put candles in-that way, the lights won't get blown out. put tablecloths on the tables and you can tie the edges down with simple satin ribbons in bows, and then scatter some glittery confetti on the tables to catch the candlelight, and you could put the table number on really lovely scrapbook paper and put it in a dollar store picture frame. You could also do hanging lanterns (either paper or metal) from the roof of the pavilion, or string up some white rope/twinkle lights to illuminate the inside of the pavilion with gentle lighting, and run satin ribbons and tulle around the pavilion posts.     The thing that will make the whole thing really romantic will be the lighting and the mood you set in the space.|`|8cj6zRtsaa	Well,  It depends on how picky yuo are. But using fake flowers would save A LOT of money. What my fiancee are doing, is having real flowers for the bouquet, and the bridal party and such, but fake for decorations. Real ones die a couple days later anyways, and fake look just as nice in pictures.  Candles are also a cheapish, but pretty way to decorate. The lighting looks pretty.  And going to fabric stores and doing things (isle runner, toule, hanging decorations, etc) yourself would also help a lot.  Going buffet style is also cheaper, food wise. And if you want an open bar, I'd set a time limit ( 2 hours or so).|`|wOBZEFXFaa	Find out if the church has any other weddings that day or that weekend. Call the other brides and ask them if they want to split the cost of some of the decorations. Most people planning a wedding are on a budget and chances are they can use the savings just as much as you!|`|nQPJfR2baa	What i'm doing is skipping the florist but not the flowers. florists are expensive and can take a big chunk out of your budget. You can buy any type of flower in bulk at flowerwholesale.com and make all the arrangements yourself. for instructions on how to make the arrangements go to ehow.com and look for instructional videos, they have quite a few. You can also tie some pretty ribbon around the chairs or pews.|`|Wrxa4vK6aa	I second the idea of decorations from dollar stores - but don't limit yourself to the stuff in the wedding section. Sometimes you can get really great ideas just by looking around the craft or other sections.    Do you have something like a Big Lots (a close-out merchandise store) near you? I got great deals on some things at Big Lots.    Also, use tulle! Yes, some people overdo it and turn everything into a frou-frou nightmare, but it's cheap and can be used to great effect.    One really cost-saving measure you can take is to use your food in lieu of decoration. For example, if you have a clear punch bowl filled with a brightly colored punch, you don't really need any extra decoration on the drinks table. Same with the cake, if it has a lot of color. I've heard of people making their centerpieces out of wedding favors. You could fill vases with candy and do the same.    Whatever you do, good luck with it!|`|AA11790156	try these websites

ItUoK0Tlaa	There may be two answers to your questions:  The first is that is how guys are.  A lot of guys just don't see the importance of holidays.  Many guys will simply say that a birthday or Christmas is just another day.  Girls often see the sentimental value of these times.  But guys usually don't; that's why you always hear of them forgetting birthdays and anniversaries.  The other answer is that perhaps he just isn't that mature enough to be in a relationship of this magnitude at this point.  You do have the child to consider as well, but consider asking him what the deal is...and why he is slacking off so entirely in the romance department.  Asking why people do things (or don't) is the most surefire way to find out what the root of the problem is and to resolve it.|`|AA10986891	Eventhough Mr.grebanahs makes two valid points I think the answer is that he has taken you for granted. You mention that you have been together for over 4 years, you have a child together and I assume you have built some what of a life together. That has made him feel comfortable with you, he knows your heart is his, he knows you love him, he knows you will stick around for the good and the bad. So he let his guard down and knows that he does not need to make an effort to win your love.     It is incredible how many of us men make this mistake and end up lossing our wifes/gf's.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Can just give for the sake of giving.  When it is his birthday or your child's, make the biggest deal from your heart that you can.  Maybe in his family birthdays/holdays were not as significant as they are to you.  In that case, he can be teached if he is willing.      Can sit down with boyfriend, and designate an anniversary date.  He doesn't have to observe it, but you can.    Sometimes we expect people to behave in ways that they simply cannot or will not.  Has nothing to do with you but with them.  If it bothers you, you have to decide if this is something you can learn to live with.  he will change if he wants, but you certainly cannot change him.  But you can show him by 'giving'......|`|buCSvGB4aa	Just be glad you wake up beside him everyday and you share a child with him. Stop being materialistic and realize what you truly have.
otTslvAOaa	you have to ask yourself...... is this relationship worth staying and fighting for.      if yes.... then stay.    if no.... then leave.|`|94b8KImYaa	Most likely he was sorry, because he was caught. Leave him, be the strong woman you are.     Good luck to you|`|rcut6bhoaa	I would move on myself.  If he was truly sorry the first time, he would not have disrespected you after that.  Good Luck|`|4HoVVCenaa	The question is, what would give you the most opportunity for long term happiness, going or staying. He is probably not going to change, so you have to decide what you are going to do about it. I would try couples counseling first, but then?|`|XTBlOf9baa	Honey, I'm an infidelity couples counselor. I help couples recover from infidelity all the time. It can be done. However, I always caution clients to give one second and one last chance. That's it. You gave it to him, and he blew it. You made your feelings known, and he cheated on you again. You did your part by giving him a second chance to be the husband you deserve, but he did not do that. There is a difference between attempting to reconcile after infidelity, and letting a person walk all over you and cheat on you again and again. If he was really sorry, he would have ended this behavior the first time he got caught. Just walk away. You did everything you could do by trying to work it out with him one time. What he chose to do after that is all on him, but you can walk away with a clear conscience knowing you gave your marriage every chance you could. He's the one that blew those chances. Forgiving him now just sends the message that he can cheat on you and treat you like this and you'll forgive him time and time again.    P.S. This is coming from someone who adamantly believes that reconciliation is possible when you have a partner who is 100% apologetic, remorseful, and committed to doing what it takes to end the behavior and work on the marriage (couples counseling, individual counseling, giving up privacy, etc.). Sorry, but your husband just does not fall into that category. As much as I believe that infidelity can be recovered from within a marriage, I also know that only one last chance should be given, otherwise he'll just learn that he can treat you like that and he'll be forgiven.|`|wKzH60Xlaa	Two words: "Tough Love" by James Dobson.    Read the book, it will give you inspiration like it did for me.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	How many times are you going to bust him before it's enough for you leave?  It sounds like he will not be changing any time soon.  You kids deserve better, especially since he is teaching them how to be an adult.  And you deserve better for sure!|`|5k7BexD3aa	He did it--he was sorry.  He did it again...he was sorry again.  You have to decide how much YOU think your self worth is.  If it was me, the 2nd time would have done me in.  You deserve better than to be treated this way.    He was sorry that he got caught--otherwise he would have told you when it happened.    It's up to you if he does it to you again...he wouldn't be doing it to me that's for sure.|`|MkBWfaJlaa	sorry he got caught - for sure|`|1BGwGFQZaa	The Amount of Investment    Sounds like he has already divorced the Family. I would not tie this Man down any longer by being his faithful wife. I guess my question is why are you staying. Unhappy Mom=Unhappy children. You are already practically a single mother at this point.     I would not have another child with this Man. I would regroup and look for a support system your parents sibling etc. Move near the support system. At this point is not about his level of sorrow but his actions. He has a real messed up character. You are not supposed to wait around till he brings you some incurable disease.     Remember you have a Life too. Your concern should not be standing by your Man. You are standing next to a boy, someone that does not take Responisbility. Just Look at the amount of time that has been devoted to this question. This world is way too wrapped up in him and his needs what about those children. They need a Mom that is 100% complete.     Take Charge in 2009. The sky is the Limit. Be strategic Move and start from ground zero till God Brings you a Hero.|`|bgWfcplBaa	Trust is the most important component in any relationship.  You don't trust him because of his many indiscretions.  He also is clearly continuing a relationship outside of your marriage now.  You have to ask yourself what YOU want....what will make you happy?  If continuing to live with a man that lies to you is it, then you have your answer. Just remember you have 2 little sponges living in your home.  His example of running out on his wife to be with other women will show your son it is ok to treat women that way.  You staying with a man who lies and puts his family at risk will teach your daughter that behavior is acceptable in a marriage.  Do you want them to learn those lessons from this situation?  Not trying to be hard on you, but turning a blind eye to his actions threatens everyone's future happiness.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Stay with him and work it out.|`|5H9woJT0aa	Im sorry to say but you need to leave him and tell him that he wont be able to see the kids until he gets his act together.......GOOD LUCK!!!!!! he is such a looser ........When he comes home sit and talk to him if you guys come up with a plan give him until june (to get his act together if not leave HIM)!!!!|`|AA10766729	When does a strong woman become stupid?  When you allow this kind of crap to go on and on and on!      I was stupid: I had a 5 year marriage to a guy who had sex with anyone who'd stand still long enough. I  just keep trying to hold it together because I thought that was what a Navy wife did.  After the second STD he brought home, I'd had ENOUGH and filed for divorce.    What your breaking point is, is something you have to decide.      I'm older and wiser now, and if it were me, I'd have walked out after the first incident....never mind trying to work it out!  But that's me.    You have to decide at what point you have had enough.      Good luck trying to figure it out....it's never easy.|`|vFCva8R5aa	The greatest predictor of future behavior is past behavior, how many times do you want this to happen? If you stay with him, you will be dealing with his infidelity for the rest of your life, He WILL continue to do it.    he is definitely sorry he got caught AGAIN! He will then re-group and try a different strategy next time. .|`|RKhSRMlZaa	This guys says he loves you yet continues, throughout your marriage, to KEEP cheating on you.  One time is one thing.  But if he keeps on doing these things I honestly don't think it's worth it.  You're always going to be his second priority underneath all the booty he's getting elsewhere outside your home.      Your children need a father who loves and respects their mother.  If they grow up seeing how he manipulates everything so he can keep disrespecting you, they will think that it's okay to treat others like that.      I'm not going to tell you to leave, but I do know this:  I would never want my children to be around that kind of behavior.  And trust me, your kids know/will know a lot more than you think.  Kids are very intuitive.      You deserve someone who is not only committed to you and your kids but values and respects you as a woman, a mother, a wife, and a partner for life.  This "man" you describe as your husband does not embody ANY of those qualities.|`|Hh92sQQbaa	Girl well ones a cheater always a cheater it doesn't matter how much he tell you that he sorry and that he love you.He is never going to chang.Don't think about how much you love him,think about you and your kids cause he isn't worth it.Good luck.|`|AaZCmTGUaa	Is that the kind of father you want around your children? Your husband is going to have to pay child support for a long time to come. I'd wait until the third deployment is over, though. Get a general power of attorney so you can access his accounts and such. Put all the extra money away and just before the deployment ends send him the divorce papers. File for sole custody. Start over again.
otTslvAOaa	make the payments.... directly into her deposit account at the bank.... that way the bank gives you a receipt of the deposit amount.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Don't get a wage garnishee.  This just makes you look like you have bad credit.    Pay by cheque so you always have a record.  If she hasn't cashed it, and you have a record of it (cheque register), you have met your obligation.  And if the cheque has been lost, she also hasn't been paid, and you should still have the money in the bank to write another cheque.    The other option is to register your maintenance agreement with maintenance enforcement.  You would then submit payment to ME and they would issue payment to her.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	When I was strapped for cash and my ex hadn't made the support payment yet, we would meet at the clerk's office and he would sign it over to me directly rather than go through the child support division.  Or you can wire the money directly to her account.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Money Order For Her to Deposit. Keep the slip and write C-Support on them. Keep them in a safe place etc.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	cancel that uncashed check and write her a new one.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Why are you so worried about this? Has she had him in the Stocks out in the Town Square?     If the check isn't cashed the money is still in your account and you can give it to her at any time. No one would ever involve a child in Child Support payments, except I guess you.     You sound incredibly paranoid. If there's some reason for that you haven't mentioned, okay. If you're just like this all the time, you really ought to get some mental help. A psychiatrist can help you with medication for paranoia.    EDIT: I have an ex that I get along perfectly with. I'm married to a man who pays CS and I get along perfectly with his ex. I would never consider bringing any of our children into adult issues because it verges on abuse. I still don't understand why you're freaking out about this, and every two weeks my husband and I are in exactly the same position. You don't state any extraordinary reason that this woman can't be trusted. I said, if she'd done something underhanded maybe your feelings are justified. You decline to state some reason, so I'm led to believe the problem is with you.  Only you know for sure, but if she hasn't done anything, maybe you should relax.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Do an online transfer directly from your account to hers.|`|svzGz9STaa	If your bank offers online bill pay, you could set it up to pay her every month so that you could prove, via the bill pay records, that a check was indeed sent. Otherwise, ask her if you can direct deposit the CS check into her checking account.    My ex once held onto a check for 9 months before she cashed it. Guess she's really hard up for money like she says, eh?
zRvt68ZYaa	If you want to get back in school, then consider an inexpensive community college to start with and stay the heck out of bars.    The navy is also an option, but it doesn't sound like you're too excited about this.    Your future and your relationship with this girl are two different things. A broken heart and I'm sorry about this; however, you should make your life decisions based on what's best for you and try to move on from worrying about that girl. Good luck!|`|Ze7oFNHBaa	Don't go to the navy, just get a good paying job!

SiniSj1eaa	??? why would there need to be a consequence? did he commit a crime?    edit:    I didnt watch the show..but thanks for that answer below.    I dont care what they said about this country..thats whats so awesome about living here. You CAN say what you want...|`|dItZAwI2aa	windmill...we live in a great country here called the USA, love it or leave it...obviously the way these people talked about the USA and its people they don't love it and need to leave it and i believe those are the consequences that are being discussed...    if u didn't see anything wrong with the way these people talked, acted etc then i must ask where your commitments lie with regards to America.|`|XZi4UJgGaa	Sure, there are consequences. He is probably suffering them right now. I didn't watch the show, and I only heard about it on YA. All those insulted audience members know his address (cuz it's online), calling his phone number, emailing him threats, emailing his workplace, and emailing his wife. Plus his wife helps ppl. who have weight issues (she has a website), and her husband is calling the other wife fat and uneducated.   Hello, the arrogant British guy shared his disgust for Americans on national tv. I don't know about legal consequences, but duh!, he is probably paying the price for it now from every insulted person who saw the show. Idiotic to think this guy is not being threatened right now. Common sense people. If he was doing this in private and nobody knew about it, then there wouldn't be any consequences. You can imagine how all the hatred and threats are going to affect him, his family, his home, and his job. Doesn't this family have to walk out the door sometimes? Fowler must have been too intelligent and educated for his own good to not realize the consequences of his televised behavior on Wife Swap.
otTslvAOaa	that might depend on the state you live in..... talk to your lawyer.|`|AA11796667	Yes until he graduates and depends on your state child support laws if he attend college.|`|7foornMVaa	You need to check your support order decree.   Most support ends when the child is 18 but some put in the support order that if the child remains a full time student then it can go until they are 21 or until they finish school.|`|rcut6bhoaa	If he is still in high school or even home schooled, you will receive it.  Sorry, but I don't know of any state ( there may be, but none that I know of) that allows past the 18 year mark or out of high school.    If there was something previously in an agreement that states otherwise, such as the other person paying for college or other higher education, then yes.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	These people ALWAYS answer this WRONG!    It depends where you live, and the support laws that govorn your state, and what the ORDER states.    In Illinois where I live, it stop at 18 or graduation of high school, whichever happens LAST.    MOST states DO not cover college aged kids but THEN AGAIN, check with the state, and read the ORDER.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	It depends on your local law. Where I live, support continues until 19 no matter what, and ends at 19 unless they go to college. At which point they get college expenses, but parents do not get child support.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	you'll receive child support until the child is out of school.    I know a friend of mine who her father was paying child support. He had to continue to pay it even when she went to college.|`|kXmsT70zaa	That depends on your child support agreement.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Your child support order should address this.  If it simply states until they are 18, then it stops at 18.|`|yFw20pJXaa	Depends on your state but usually yes and if the child goes to college and remains in YOUR home then support still has to be paid,  go to your states website and look for child support guidelines and/or rules you can get alot of info there ;)|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Check with your lawyer or check your child support papers and divorce papers.  Some states say it ends the day the child turns 18, some go through the end of the school year and other states have changed to age 19.    I know 2 years ago when my nephew turned 18 in February, it stopped right then.  That boy had flunked a year and didn't get out of school until he was 19 yrs 4 months old.  He received no support for the extra year.  The child support order specified no support after age 18.|`|D1J6ZYmmaa	it depends. my dad is paying back pay in child support and I am 26yrs old...  sooo    it can happen|`|EENUWAP7aa	This is what my fellow Veteran buddy did. When his daughter turned 18 yrs old. He contniued to send child support except this time it came adressed to his daughter only and she was the only one that could cash the check and Momma got ticked off.    What comes around goes around.    By the way once they hit 18...its over jack.|`|yhO62JALaa	Yes. Unless it's stated in your support and if the child is working it could effect it.
VSVQHKwKaa	Look darlin,    You don't feel loved because you're not acting loving. Your man isn't going to respond to your threats (yes, threats) forever. Who would?     You're DEMANDING attention, DEMANDING internet behavior (and it wasn't porn, or else you'd say porn), DEMANDING that he make you happy.    But even if he did capitulate...that's what it would be....capitulation.     Your man is on the computer because the computer doesn't nag him. It doesn't whine and complain. It doesn't pout in bed or second guess him.    What it DOES do is provide him with entertainment, it rewards him with high scores or level advancement, it connects him to other people who are interested in his ideas, and it provides him with additional information.    It's his DUTY to put up with you and to provide for you....no matter how nasty you are or how little love you give him.     But that doesn't mean he has to like it. That's why you're seeing less and less of him.    Now that you've made this mess....you feel guilty and want to run away from it.     Crazy!    So here is what I want you to do:    1. I want you to compliment your husband. I want you to speak to him in a soft, warm voice. I want you to whisper things in his ear, even if it's just "Please bring milk home".     2. I want you to never demand another thing from your husband. I want you to ASK for things. Instead of "YOU NEVER SPEND TIME WITH MEEE!!"....I want you to say "Honey, could you please give me a hug and a kiss...I really need one right now." or "I really need you to take off all your clothes and meet me in the bedroom."    You'll get much more of what you want with honey than with vinegar.     3. I want you to recognize that YOU HAVE THE POWER IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.     Yep...I said it. You have the power.    You have the power to make him feel strong, loved, cared for, responsible, happy, successful, and devoted.    You also have the power to make him feel weak, neglected, unimportant, sad, a failure, and dispensible.     And that is why you're unhappy.    So, meet him at the door today with a kiss and a grin and a big hug. Ask him for hugs and cuddles without worry or reservation. If he sits down in front of the computer....just tell him you're going to bed and what you plan on doing to him once he comes to bed. Then go put on something naughty and relax. If he doesn't come in till 3 am...he'll still see you all decked out in lace and realize that he missed quite a treat. He won't miss his rendezvous again.     Try that for a few weeks and let us know if you feel any better.    Good Luck!    YOU HAVE THE POWER!!|`|ev33OxJbaa	Most women go through this feeling, your raising children and do much for your family. Men do not understand that is very hard work. Your man is addicted to porn and the computer is a hook. It is worse than watching TV all the time.  You need some marriage counseling and get re connected. You have lost communication with each other. Find a baby sitter and plan a night out for just you two. Marriage is hard work and you just cannot run away. Maybe get a baby sitter and go see some friends, go out for a visit, let him take care of the kids while you go out and enjoy yourself. Seek some answers in a quiet time to yourself.|`|njgF24Tbaa	MARITAL COUNSELING    If he works and you don't work, check out the computer if it's not password protected and see his internet browsing history.|`|u7f0QB37aa	You are suffering from depression and you are married to a porn freak|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Don't stay in a marriage when you are unhappy.  I did that and it was a big mistake.|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	There is something he is doing on the computer that you don't know about and one day with out him knowing you need to stand somewhere he can't see you and watch what he is going on and see if he is doing something or not that you don't like. That what I would do if I was you because it sounds to me that he is doing it when you go to bed so he feels that you won't know about it because you are in bed so that's when you act like you are going to bed one night and watch what he is doing on the computer and it sounds to me that he would save the computer before he would save you and the boys.|`|bgWfcplBaa	Yep...been there...only it is me on the computer all the time. My husband is a nice guy, but I am so unhappy and want out all the time.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe I should be crucified for wanting out.  All I can say is that is how I feel, and our feeling aren't wrong.  It is what makes us who we are.  I will get out. I just got out of nursing school, and plan on leaving as soon as I get a few paychecks.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I think you should find someone to watch your kids and plan a nice weekend away with your husband.  Sounds like the two of you really need to reconnect.  Make sure the place has things for the two of you to do and no computers!|`|jswDLpJzaa	wow... I think I would switch marital situations with you in a heartbeat. I wish my problems were as easy to deal with as that. Try seeking some counseling. I hope you can save your marriage, but still. that seems like a walk in the park compared to what I deal with daily. good luck.|`|svg71dazaa	I posted the same type of question a few days ago. Sometimes marriage is hard as is, never mind the extra dramas that creep in. I would also be upset if my husband was on the internet 24/7. You have needs and so does he so chat to him about it. We often shut up for too long and then burst all out one day. Try communicate to him and explain that you want to leave and that you bored. I did that and it helped us work out a lot of the drama we had.|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	one thing you could do is suggest moving the PC to a more "public" place...then check out his reaction. if he's not doing anything wrong, then he'll be cool with it. chances are he's doing something that he shouldn't, if you really want to find out, check his browser history, unless he erases it everytime he's done. there are still other ways to find out...ask any computer geek to help you if you don't know.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	You answered  your question with your question:    MARRIAGE IS A TRAP CONCEIVED BY THE CHURCH TO CONTROL PEOPLE.
AA10986891	That he won't take or return your calls is a clear sign that he is struggling to get over you. He is avoiding you cause he is afraid that any contact with you might destroy any little progress he accomplished to let you go and he fears that if he talks to you he might ask you to get back together with him.    The angrier he is at you, the harder the time he is letting you go.|`|AO5WtlwZaa	Hello!  I see you care about him very much! The best thing to do right now is to wait for him to come back to you!

I hope this helps!      ~Anastasia~|`|qeQVyLW7aa	the only way to get over someone is not being around them and not talking to them. if your son is old enough to understand tell him the situation. don't think about him all the time. get out and do more to get your mind off of him.

No comment. Don't seem too confident right now.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well I don't see how you can be Emo when your funny with a good sense of humour? Usually emos are always depressed and emotional, always looking at the negative side of life..but other than that nah your fine you just gotta find someone you like, if you think emo girls are pretty then go for it. It's got nothing to do with the way you look, i've seen way uglier guys with girlfriends haha..good luck bro.|`|qLJnCj0Naa	Maybe you give off  the wrong impression! lol!  But you're not bad lol!

But dude just be you, you know I know it sounds cliche? lol Oh and to get onto my advice, stop trying to look for a girl it doesn't work the way you want it to. Believe me I looked and never found but then I stopped and found haha. If you look for someone you'll find the sexual aspect no problem aha ;) but if your going for an actual relationship dont look for a specific group or what other people say just stop trying if you meet a girl you think is cool give it a shot stick with it and maybe a spark or somehthing will pop up.|`|dFmZhtpvaa	the peircing.  emo is ok i guess just  well i don't get how they don't like you!!!!! your HOTT! just start hangin out with them and get out there it will all come in time!!!!

Who doesn't like a guy with a sense of humor i think that's what all girls are looking for. and emo is not a bad thing. everyone thinks emo is all black and piercings and don't wanna talk to anyone. but this is not ur case. and emo means emotional i think ppl just use it out of context.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	You're really cute, so I don't see why you  haven't had a girlfriend yet. Lol.    Try to be a little more outgoing and show that you are interested in girls. Try to act as if you're SOMEWHAT better than others, and it will imply that you are very sure of yourself, but NOT full of yourself. Girls will notice this, trust me. A lotta girls look for a "bad boy", but I feel that being a sincere, good looking guy seals the deal. Just be yourself, and a little more outgoing, and you WILL be noticed!    Good luck!|`|Q0xB1aAXaa	You're really cute.  Hang out with girls at your school;  just be really sociable.   Your local mall could be a score on the "emo girls"  Just be yourself.

So just be open, initiate conversation with girls you would be intrested in.    Talk about yourself, be funny, be different.  Ask about her, compliment, flirt a little.    You sound GREAT,so I'm sure if you actually follow these tips you'll have a girlfriend in no time :D|`|Kx1NoXXMaa	i dont understand y u never had a girlfriend cuz ur sexxy|`|8tMTyPomaa	if u want my opinion   wen i first look at ur pic i thought u were gay  maybe because the piercing  take it off and that may help u wen the girl        i dont get y ur having problem    ur pretty hot   i would date u|`|Go830lTeaa	i really dont get y people are so pesstamist about how others dress/look....first of all EMO is not from how u dress its from the inside emotion.    ok.. just be nice and understanding to all girls, make them get that feeling that u really do care... a lot of girls like guys who understands and would support them. let them feel open to you and see how everything goes.     dont care wat anyone says just do wat u think u should... follow ur heart|`|KACY7vGGaa	Who cares if your a virgin I am to and I am 22yrs guys are asses no offense but you should find the right one even if I was not a virgin I would so dig one.

How to meet a gal that is easy its the matter of fact men don't give us time to show how we are. you can women anywhere.|`|UfyYRyBmaa	Emo scene people have alot of beef with everyone..sorry I just have stuff against them, so childish. Anyways. You're pretty cute...just lose the lip ring lol if anything get an eyebrow piercing, those are sexy on a guy, or nipple ring...get an earring, I love men with earrings and it's so common now.   The best way to meet ladies is through friends honestly becuase rarely you ever get a girl through random talking on the bus. Or school...school actually lol   Just be yourself..try to joke around abit, luagh and ask her about herself and her life.   You might never have had a girlfriend cuase you're too picky or something cuase I thought it was weird I didn't have a boyfriend for past 4 years but then now that I do, I look back and realize how many guys tried to get me but I flat out rejected them cuase they weren't my type..|`|q74VPVCeaa	emo is hot (: but i would label you more as edgy. maybe you should try barnes & noble or starbucks, some place like that. good luck!
NKuUBpUQaa	i dont think so|`|mAZi1eH7aa	As a fantasy it is not abnormal at all. However, the reality never is as good as the fantasy. You should keep that in mind. Besides, as a fantasy you can have things as you want. As a reality, you have to see her for the rest of your life, good or bad. So have your fun, but choose wisely.

Males, on average, think about sex every 7 seconds.    Each day, there are over 120 million sexual intercourse taking place all over the world.    Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England - but only in tropical fish stores. (But of course!)    There are men in Guam whose job is to travel the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay them for the privilege of having sex for the 1st time.    Sex burns 360 calories per hour!    Male and female rats may have sex twenty times a day.    22% of American women aged 20 gave birth while in their teens. In Switzerland and Japan, only 2% did so.    For every normal webpage, there are five porn pages.    The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is decapitation.    Turkeys can reproduce without having sex. Its called parthenogenesis.    In india it is cheaper to have sex with a prostitue than buy a condom!    Formicophilia is the fetish for having small insects crawl on your genitals. Gross!!|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Sex is a big part in any relationship, and I think you would have to be a very very strong couple to get by without having no sex at all in a relationship . Though saying that I wouldnt say its the be all and end all either. There just has to be some sort of happy medium :)|`|IfwpibHqaa	no love is then sex comes 2nd x|`|b2WGvF18aa	LOVE is more important than anything!!!!!!|`|M2JNgbI1aa	well it can last long without it,  as long as you both respect eachother  and if he truly loves you or she truly loves  you she understands
iNFE3utOaa	I know lots of ways to make money online for free such as building websites (blogger is free), putting google or yahoo ads on them, then sending people to them using youtube videos etc. If you want to know more ways let me know, I explain it to people but I feel Im wasting my time if people arent interested. A job is less work and pays more though to be honest, but if you want to stay in school and have no options, it helps.      THANKS FOR THE THUMBS DOWN. SEE WHAT I MEAN.  HOW IS BUILDING A WEBSITE ANY DIFFERENT THEN YAHOO PUTTING THOSE ADS OVER THERE AND MAKING MONEY OFF THEIR VISITORS? people are too negative and sceptical and think everything is a scam instead of stopping for a minute, thinking about what someone is saying, and analyzing it. Too quick to judge something when they see the words "make money online"...that equals Scam to these people no matter what.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	dropping out of school will make her feel worse.  Stay in school, get good grades, make the honor roll etc. . . from that, you should be able to get some scholarships to attend some local community college for now.  Get your core subjects down and then transfer to a larger college.  Make something of yourself.  Do something that will help you with future careers not jobs.  This way you will be able to assist your mother financially if she needs it.  Right, continue to be supportive and help out around the house as much as you can.  Try to always be upbeat and cry in your pillow if you have to.    You're a sweet girl for seeing your mother's hardship and caring so much.  I'm sure you are and will be her pride and joy.|`|fej0YYxjaa	From what you said you have done everything that you can to help her.  You are still a kid and you shouldn't have to take on the responsibilities of an adult.  One thing you could say to her that might make her take a sigh of relief is "I appreciate all that you are doing for the family and although things may not be perfect, I know that you are doing the best (and more) that you can do."  I am sure that she appreciates all that you are doing to help around the house, every little bit helps.      You mentioned dropping out of school, I would highly recommend that you do not do that.  It is possible to go to school and hold down a job, I used to work Monday- Friday from after school until at least 7 and then go to my second job (also worked full days on the weekends).  It seems that you (and the rest of our country) are having trouble finding work, I know that in my school system they had a work-study type thing where students went to school for part days and worked the rest of the day.  I would suggest talking to an administrator in your school that you feel comfortable with (you can obviously share as much of your story to them as you want or tell them whatever they want) and see if they have some sort of program that is similar to that.  They also might have local jobs that they can recommend to you.      Keep your head up! I know that it is tough, I came from a rough childhood but the lessons that I learned from having to be responsible and have values makes it slightly bearable.  You are doing your best and you should smile about that.
otTslvAOaa	try yellow or gold..... that should go with red and black.|`|hkwBR1moaa	gold or white|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations:    Really, I wouldn't worry about another color.  I am assuming that you will be wearing white or ivory?  Use that as the third color.  Just my opinion......    Centerpieces:  What do you like/want?  What is your budget?  You can't go wrong with a vase of flowers and some votive around it.  Or...just a bowl with some floating candles set on a mirror tile always looks nice.    Favors:  I prefer anything edible.  Just a few Hershey Kisses tied in some tulle and wrapped in a silk ribbon is nice.  OR....you can put some candies in a colored organza bag like these:    http://www.weddingsforless.com/wedding-s...    Hope this helps!|`|AA11790156	try this website lots of ideas|`|Eu0kPJ5Iaa	You could do Lt. pink to have a softer color with the deep red and black to balance it out. You could get tall vases and put water in them and red and pink roses in the vase one of each and a floating candle on top then do votive candles around the vase and spread black diamond accents around centerpiece. Or use a black candelabra and put candles in it and use pink and red flowers around it. For favors I am doing a candy bar and the candy will be my colors. Hope this helps you congrats!|`|AA10784932	i think ivory would look great w/ those two colors and ivory is easy to find in wedding stuff.  take a look on ebay in their wedding stuff, even if you don't buy anything they have some good ideas for homemade stuff.. im making almost everything for my wedding. good luck!|`|Ye0lgbwiaa	How about silver/ platinum?   A friend of mine is using similar colors and doing an Asian theme.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Beige or Gold as an accent color. The deep red and black should be the main colors and the third color should be used on a few things.

It's not because they are good-looking, rich, kind, trustworthy, loving ... it should be that they are "helpful."  Think about the concept of "helpfulness," not "hurtfulness," and sooner or later you'll reach the same conclusion that it's worthwhile to look for someone who is "helpful."

Maybe instead of going to him ALL the time for your problems you could try going to a friend? And if its very personal maybe you can go to your boyfriend but try not to make an all the time thing, you know?        hope i helped a little bit? haha x]
ovDqPtg8aa	oh man not another one!!  i have seen a few questions likethis, and this was a best answer plus some of my ideas.      *if he looks at your lips (DEAD giveaway)  *if he tries to make his muscles look huge! lol  *his pupils are dialated!  *he plays with his hair alot   *he hates the guys you flirt with  *calls you non stop  * If you turn around and you catch him looking at you,  * If he starts acting nicer when you're around him,  * If he says "yes" to all the things you ask him to do,  * If he treats you differently than others,  * If he tries to sit next to you at work, in class, at lunch, or play on a team with you during Gym/Recess  * If he looks at you a lot every time you smile or laugh,  * If he acts immaturely around you, like poking, teasing or playful flirting,  * If he seems to always want to hang out with you,  * If he gets closer with a body part, or if he tries to touch you (e.g. when you touch him he might touch you back)  * If you catch him peeking at you and he smiles,  * If he tries to make you laugh,  * If he tries to copy you,  * If he tries to keep you in view for as long as possible or tends to look around and stop when he finds you,  * If he subtly looks at you but makes it look like he is looking at the girl next to him,  * If he constantly calls you and uses an excuse -such as What was the homework?  * If he goes out of his way to talk to you (e.g. if he goes to the other side of your school to talk to you because he knows you have a class there),  * If you see him staring at something by turning his head 90 degrees and when you look at him he smiles and turns away, when this happens, check his pupils, he might have actually been staring at you  * If he invites you to his birthday party or any kind of party,  * If you flirt with a friend of his when he can see, and he looks jealous or automatically flirts back, (but don't flirt with them just to find out if he likes you)  * If he talks to you and wants to know how you're doing,  * If he is nicer or tries to talk to your friends,  * If he asks about you to your friends when you're not around,  * If he asks you to dance with him at the dance. Note: He may be trying to be nice because he thinks you like him. But if you are at a middle school dance, he's probably too vain and self centered of a fraidy cat, so he probably likes you.  * If he walks past you and tries to look cool so you can glance at him  * If a guy tries to show you things he got that are somewhat expensive (e.g. a cellphone) or he tries to impress you,  * If you notice when he gets out of class and starts to walk a little slower than usual, then he's trying to give you the opportunity to talk to him!  * If he always talks to you there's a great chance that he likes you.  * If he feels so awful letting you down that he lies.  * If he would do anything to spend more time talking to you (e.g. if he talks/texts to you until 2:30 in the morning).  * If you realize that he ignores you when your looking but when you look out of the corner of your eye, he turns back around to look back at you,  * If he's talking to his friends and nodding like he's paying attention but you realize he's not, he's actually been staring at you the whole time!  * If he walks down the hallway (at school) and he "accidentally" bumps/touches you, if he moves your chair or pulls your hair etc.  * If he ignores you almost completely. For example, when you call his name he does nothing, but when your friend does, he pays attention. This is because he might be embarrassed or not sure how to approach you. Be careful, though, he might ignore because he just flat-out doesn't like you!    if you like him, turn on teh charm! lol. I love being a girl!  just don't make it obvious.   give him a perky smile and just joke around with him alot.   just treat him as you would your best guy friend i guess, that's what i do.   don't make it akward for him though!|`|838VJJGvaa	Yeah.

wAJbnHGjaa	When you love someone, it's tough to let them go, even when they hurt you. You can't know what it feels like until it happens to you. Many guys (and ladies) say that they would dump a cheater, but if you have a family and a history, you don't always throw in the towel without a fight.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I think you are both better off divorced.|`|kT5Bk0T8aa	it's nothing like trust and faith,which is hard to find|`|0afWMIoKaa	I think he really loves you.

If you are asking if I support the marriage of a twelve year old girl, of course not, she is a child.|`|R71NpXKKaa	OMG my daughter is 12 years old.

qyhbnZqjaa	yes, your eating dinner at a restaurant, and your date doesn't talk at all, and just stares at you, mean while your listening to the exciting conversation in the tables next to you, because your so bored, and they start to notice your staring at them, and your date and you haven't talked the entire time, and you start to feel like a freak..
84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Aw, I'm sorry your family is being like this!! That's horrible. =( I think it's awesome that you're still wanting to do this though. I know if you just went out and eloped, you would regret it.. I know I would. A wedding is really important for the bride. I don't understand why people would rather just elope. I know it'd be cheaper, but you don't have the great memories of the wedding.  If you still want to do your wedding in your hometown, I would take a weekend or two off and go to the wedding venues and vendors, flower places, etc. and get it done. You could look online and do some research before you do everything so you don't go there and waste your time trying to find places.  This is a pretty good website: http://www.weddingchannel.com/  You can also use whitepages.com and find venues in your area.    Good luck and I hope your family will support you more.|`|4POGapREaa	That's exactly why I always confront everything head on.  Some people just don't verbalize to you when they're unhappy & then they all start talking to each other & getting on the bandwagon & before you know it, they're all upset & you're totally perplexed.  I hate that.    In any case, I seriously would elope if I were you.  Your family doesn't sound thrilled about your wedding anyway so why put yourself through all of the stress, the details, the cost, etc. for people who aren't even on your side?  I live in CA & planned my Hawaii wedding completely over the phone & the internet.  What it really sounds like is that you need a wedding planner if you can't be there but it would be expensive.  You can call vendors & explain the situation to them.  I'm sure they wouldn't mind emailing you photos, price lists, etc.  You'll just have to trust that they're reliable since you can't meet them in person.  It's not ideal, but in my experience, everyone I ran into was totally on the up & up during my original planning.|`|oI9Z8XhXaa	Keep the wedding where it is, but hire a wedding planner from that area as well. That way they can deal with the numbers, looking at venues, and whatever else all while keeping the stress and details from your family. You would be suprised at how cheap you can get some wedding planners. Most customize their services to your needs so that you actually save money.|`|nqINitkmaa	I am from Michigan and I am planning my wedding in california. I found vendors online and then I set a weekend to go and pick a venue, and to meet with all the vendors, it was a very very long two days for my fiance and I but we got it all done. I would suggest doing it that way, you can meet with them and book them in person then correspond through e-mail with them about everything else. Its not that difficult and I don't have help from anyone. You can do it!!|`|AA11790156	Go to this website they will give you all the local vendors for the area your looking at|`|0AShsMsoaa	i am so sorry. i think it is kind and very charming of you to want to do this.  i dont understand their meanness, but, maybe they feel they will disappoint you and that you are better at them at doing this kind of thing.  my own mom would not help me with mine cause she had never done one and i did events all the time, i just visited the city i married in, because i too did my wedding from 400 miles away, and took a weekend,  visited my vendors and venues, and wrapped it all up.  also, google can help you with any numbers you might need.  also switchboard.com|`|sGP6s7uraa	Ah, stress.  It does so much in so little time.  I think your family was unaware as to how much WORK went in to planning a wedding.  My fiance has more time off for work so he's helping planning and consulting with vendors and what not.  His finger is part of the planning, he's not just my gopher LOL... But he is starting to realize what all ACTUALLY is involved in planning a wedding.  Even a simple one.  If you want your wedding in your hometown, so be it.  Just know that it will be harder because you will be so far away and most of your family will not want to help. Do you have any friends?  Recruit them as bridesmaids and "helpers" if need be.  Just remember to thank them and give them proper recognition.  Get your numbers and go for it.  Calling and emailing are a big help.  I made transactions primarily over the internet (I live about 2 hours away from the town I'm moving to and getting married in).  That's all I can give you about planning. I don't live anywhere near West Virginia.  Just google "popular wedding venues, west virginia" or "salons, west virginia" or "florists, west virginia" and you should get some really good hits.  From there, all you have to do is call.  Best of luck!|`|woOeYFrEaa	Probably your best bet would be to arrange a couple 3-4 day weekends so you can just travel there and knock it out.  I got married in my hometown but I got the majority of my wedding planned when I was on vacation for a week--just hit all my vendors and got it locked in.    Plus, I'd just ask your family what happened and why they feel like you were asking for too much help.    So sorry this is happening to you.  Just hang in there!|`|NyRBCufpaa	I can't give you and explanation for why your family has suddenly had a change of heart but I think that if you want your wedding to be in your hometown then do so. But if you are only doing that to make it easier on your family to be able to go then I think that you should have your wedding where ever you would like to. It's your wedding it's not meant to be planned to please other people.|`|hkwBR1moaa	That sounds weird... Something obviously happened.  Your best bet is to straight out ask.  If you can't get any answers out of them, then maybe your bridesmaids can help.  Or what about your fiance's family.  If that won't work, all I can suggest is that you use online resources.  Can you visit your hometown at any point and try to make all kinds of appointments on the same day.  I wish you luck and keep us updated!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Go to a bridal expo.  Find one thing like a photographer or the reception hall.  They usually have lots of ideas.  My reception hall had a list of all vendors who had catered things there before.  A photographer gave me a list of 5 or 6 cake people.  Put something on Craigs List.  Ask brides who they recently used.  Ask around from high school friends to see if they have gotten married and who they used.    Maybe you are being demanding with all your questions.  Maybe you were needing a lot of support.  You don't really need them to get you numbers as you have a yellow pages but you will need someone willing to send you pictures over emails and be willing to make a couple trips back to meet with those vendors.  If that's impossible hire a wedding planner.  She will have her own vendor contacts and be willing to meet with them.    Compose a book of things you like--flower arrangements you like, cakes you like the look of.  Then you can give this notebook to the planner and she'll have an idea of your taste.  I bought a 3 ring binder and filled it with those clear pages that you slide papers in the top.  I divided it into sections for Bridesmaid Hair Flowers and put pictures of bridesmaids dresses in, flower arrangements I like, etc.  Then when each was selected I cleaned out the book's section and just had one picture in the Bridesmaid section of the dress.
GjW3oov1aa	i think he still cares but might be afraid of commitment. i know this is really hard for you especially mentally. keep doing what your doing but do for yourself as well.Go out let him know you're not just waiting for him. be good to yourself.|`|DO2acM2Vaa	you should just meet up with him and ask him point blank what he thinks of you. whether or not he has any feelings toward you and what they are if any|`|3HhhHWd4aa	No, he does not care.
b2f05254ed10a5821d8b08c2f268ba89aa	wat do u mean u talk to him like other couples do? i have friebnds that i talk to like they r my bfs but they r just good guy friends. maybe ur reading him wrong
Mxq1NQJdaa	Of course it is......it would be abnormal if he did not!!
lblSUpYFaa	My wife gets turned on by women too.  I think that some women have underlying sexual fantasies about women.  While she has never acted on her desires, we have our best sex after she has been turned on by a friend of hers that she fantasizes about.  Funny...her friend has no idea.    Use your imagination and have fun with it...we do.|`|qyhbnZqjaa	because women are sexy, we can't help it|`|bLzChr3Yaa	Women are beautiful and can be enjoyed by both sexes. However, just because you find them attractive doesn't mean you have to have sex with them. As an adult you should be able to control your urges.  If you husband just one day found another woman pretty and went ahead and had sex with her, would that be OK?  Use your head not you pelvic area.
RcAofGkIaa	You're growing up...that's good, and asking yourself some tough questions, so here goes; yes, being young is a time to enjoy yourself, but NOT at the expense of your future.  Learning to discipline yourself is something you're going to have to come to grips with if you ever want to mature.  Probably up until now, you've had your parents set a lot of rules for you.  Now is the time that you need to begin to learn to "parent" yourself.  You make it sound like the choice is between having fun or valuing your education, it's not.  It is learning that SOME fun is good, but to basically waste time, while you have the opportunity to learn things in school that will help you in the future is very self-destructive.  I'm glad you're pretty and popular, but here's a big question...so what?  So, it means life is easier for you, pleasanter for you, and you've done nothing to earn this, you were born that way. You need to learn to respect yourself for things you've EARNED, like good grades, like preparing for your own life, like studying where there is so much empty fun to be had.  If you feel that school is taking over your teenage/having fun life, you've got some re-assessing to do.  It may help you to have a tutor to get you into the habit of studying, talk to your folks.  But the first person you need to have a talk with is yourself.  What is your life going to be?  I truly wish you luck.|`|KDst9z5Naa	You need to learn balance in your life. School needs a dedicated amount of time to study and do school work per day and then socialize. Also , see if you can get a study hall to get work done . You need a organizer and stick with its daily goals .|`|gQloDbGDaa	look at it this was: in two years you can get you GED and you wont have to worry about school. yay!|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	You still have 4 years to enjoy the teenage life you don't need to bring yourself down now think about it because you still have a long time before you become an adult trust me I was like you and I got over it and I'm 20 years old now and I'm still enjoying life after my teenage years and I finished high school. And you can do the same thing don't put yourself down and don't let it get to you. You need to make some room on the weekends for when you want to do what you want. You are only 15 teen and you sound like you are worrying more about your social life trust me it is always going to be like that for you because you are popular. So start doing good on your school work.|`|fjmWhYsJaa	well i think i know what you're talking about, I've been to a similar situation but at the end i found out that I'm just frustrated because I'm not doing that good at school as i used to do. What you can do is slow down a little bit, take a break even a day or two from school work and do the things that you want/love to do, reward yourself! at the end of that day try to organize yourself and try to have a fresh start all over again. Organize yourself, plan on the things that you think you need to work up on in order to balance between fun/friends and school.  School is just a part of teenage life and believe it or not you'll gonna need whatever your learning now in the near future regardless on the field that you will choose whether an actress or a writer even a basketball star!. It's not taking over your life in fact almost all teenagers go at the  same situation like where you at now, you just have to deal with it and find ways to get over with it  I hope this will help ^_^|`|rSzvXjiqaa	Hi again,  I totally understand!    Here is my story:  I used to live in Winnipeg, MB.  I am a religious jew, and i wanted to go to a jewish school, but there isnt a jewish religious highschool in Winnipeg.    So before i went in to grade 9, i convinced my parents to let me move to Israel and learn there.  It took a long time, but i succeeded.  I live with a wonderful family who deosnt take any money from my family and take great care of me.  I even have my own room which they painted purple before i moved in!  Anyways, grade9 isnt an easy year, especially in a different language which i didnt speak.  On top of it all i missed my family.  I am the oldest of 6 kids so i really missed them...  I had to work really hard, even when i just wanted to go out with my friends...i got a lot of help and after 3 and a half months i spoke Hebrew fluently (i am really good with languages) and schoolwork got easier.  By the end of grade 9 i was doing really well.  But going into grade10 was even worse...harder and with more exams and tests.  I started missing out with friends and having fun.  when everyone else was going out or having a party i was at home doing homework.  The only thing that helped me was making a balance.  NEVER say "ill do it tomrrow."  homework will build up when you do that.  do it and get iit overwith, and then you can have fun.  Its hard, but trust me, its worth the effort, i just got my report card and it as really good, and then i went to an -end-of-term party with my friends! =] see, you can make a balance...  Good luck and have fun!  =]

b7dzGmTHaa	you guys could go walk at the beach and talk things out, umm you could also go to the library or the park, you could also just hang out during the day like go to the different shops and stuff and get to know each other, maybe go to a skating ringer or whatever their called or just go to each others house|`|vUPnEcUuaa	well if you like him and you know he likes you what is there to rush it was already presented to you so go ahead and then go from there.|`|BWPtZkIDaa	if u wanna talk dont take him 2 da movies!!!!  take him out 2 eat (alone)  ask him wat kinda food he likes  good luck :D|`|HKaMsKltaa	movies bc u can talk and go to a movie were there is no kids or older people more like ur age and sit in the back and when no one is looking u can make out and stuff and then go to a dinner and go to a movie that u both don't really want to see!!! so u can focuse on each other not the movie!!! hope  i helped:)|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	Personally i think that you should go out to dinner (to talk and get to know each other a little more) then try to go somewhere where your alone but not exactly alone, like a concert or like a fair type of place where there are people there but you can still have your alone date. Then maybe end the night with like coffe or something to end the night, Hope i helped   -Joe|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	Depending on where you live  you could go for a walk, visit a museum.

dIxQ9rV5aa	Your parents don't want you to become like the people who behaved arrogantly toward them, when they were younger.  They got enough arrogance from other people, without getting it from their daughter too.    Unfortunately, we don't know your parents, so we don't know what it might take to convince them that you wouldn't become like that.    If arrogant people traumatized them when they were young, it may be impossible.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	To be successful in any argument, you have to directly address your opponents points.    They say they are snobby - ask them if they think you are snobby and if they think just by joining cheer leading, you will become a snob. Tell them you think they did a good job with you and you don't think you're going to treat anyone any differently just because you're joining cheer leading.    Always get in trouble - tell them so do all sorts of kids.  Jocks, nerds, goths... kids get in trouble regardless of their social group.  They should have faith they raised you right and able to make good choices.    Expensive - well, if you need their help then you're sort of stuck.  You could offer to work off the expenses around the house or pay for some of it via baby sitting etc.    Cheer leading is a great activity for young women.  It teaches discipline, teamwork, leadership and it's athletic which is important in any young person's life.|`|j7XHvaoYaa	cheerleading wont TURN YOU INTO a snobby person duh. lol, it is very acrobatic!!!!!! and not expensve|`|fSJn0gQLaa	First make sure your parents can actually afford it, you do not want to put stress on them for something that might cause them financial hard ship.    If that is not an issue, just get some facts together and tell them why you really want to be a cheerleader. Cheerleaders don't really get in trouble, but the snobby aspect you can tell them is due to developing more self-esteem which is a good thing.    Also you can tell them it is exercise and good for your health and keeping you active.|`|jnfLQlvXaa	Well, hon. I used to be a cheerleader... It was very fun i must say... but not all cheerleaders are snobs. I used to be one and ended up being goth... just tell them that you'll be ok and not all cheerleaders are snobby!|`|PGJKLZCVaa	Cheerleading is so much fun! I have done it before. Tell them its not all about being slutty and cheering for boys. Show them varsitywired.com where cheerleaders compete. Keeps you in shape, healthy, and focused on keeping up your grades in school.  When i did cheerleading, no one was snotty or rude just to be, we became sisters with lifetime friendships. its great for you to do!|`|DuVTqpBbaa	you should tell them that high school cheerleaders can get scholarships & cheerleaders are only snobby if you go into snobby. usually if your in it for the game not the popularity then you'll be good.|`|hzbUVANiaa	You can tell them that you've always wanted to do cheerleading and that it will really help you around school.   :]  :]
AA10743159	I would say no way, unless that Notary Public has authorization from the State  to marry people.  Those two licenses are totally different. Although I suspect, that there are those who have them both. I would hope your sister, checked up on that before they god "married".  In most wedding ceremonies, the minister or whomever is conducting the ceremony, usually states, "By the Power invested in me, by the State of North Carolina, I now pronounce you man and wife"  Your sister, should check up on that issue, as later on down the line, there could be legal ramifications, if it turns out, the Notary Public, had no authority to conduct weddings.|`|kT5Bk0T8aa	yes|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	true|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	No they do not. you have to be married by someone licensed to marry. If the notary is Licensed then yes. But more times not. Judge, priest, Ships captain. Or alternative religious leader who is recognized. Did they sign wedding certificate and did they register them at city hall. They must register it at city hall to be legal.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Not in California they don't. I have never heard of that.
sfCnE2O4aa	Hi Jenny,    Being a Daddy and having a daughter your exact age, I can tell you that meeting a boy is a bigger deal for the Daddy than it is for the daughter.  It's like a right of passage for us Daddy's into old-man-hood.  :)    What I would look for, if I were to let my daughter out of my sight, which I don't, is whether or not the boy seemed intelligent.  No Daddy wants to turn his baby girl loose with an idiot.  And we Daddy's know this boy our daughter is meeting is NOT likely to be the man she chooses to marry, so we put it into perspective and just hope the kid is smart, respectful, clean-cut (within reason) and an all around good kid.    There really is no reason to be nervous.  Your father is probably more nervous than you and your friend are.    I answered your Military question from the other day.  I hope you took the time to watch the movie I pointed you to.  The Addendum version is the one I'd really hope you watched.  It is so important so you can make an informed decision on joining the armed services.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	He is there to meet your parents.  Let your parents take the lead.  Ask your parents if they want to play a game like scrabble or something when he is there.  If they say no, then tell them that the conversation will be up to them to start because you and your boyfriend are nervous.  Just be honest.      I'm sure your parents will be cool with him.  And may I say, it's nice to see that young men are still meeting the parents prior to dates.  That's awesome.|`|jnfLQlvXaa	Well, hon. Just let them talk... Don't be nervous cuz then they will think you are hiding something from them!
n53HeORBaa	well it really sucks if someone important in your life just left and you have no contact whatsoever but as they say "it is better to miss someone quietly than tell them that you miss them and get no response at all"   better keep that memories for now, try to re open your communication lines who knows that is what you need to feel better, maybe he is waiting for you to talk to him again, you can never tell until you give it a shot so go for it just be ready for whatever the relates of your actions it might be good or bad but at least you gave it a go|`|p640gH9vaa	I do!|`|ORN59idwaa	Where did he go? Did he stop talking to you, or did he leave the city?    If it's the first one, then try to talk to him more.  If it's the second one, do the same! Call him and ask what's been going on. This will lead into a long discussion. Wait a day or two, and call him back with updates on your life.    Yes this recently happened to me. We got into a big fight, and it just felt like there's a hole in my heart. But we got back together, after I decided to have a talk with him.
