Now I've isolated the phone function to a tiny little unit that I can hold to my head and even make calls from.

I don't know, cool or uncool???

20090202151548AAdZ1xP	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Do you know where I can find boots like these?	 http://www.target.com/Mossimo-Kamryn-Tal...       I only re-posted this because last time my link didn't work, and I want more people to be able to see it.       But anyways, I'm looking for boots like the ones above. Not the same exact ones at a different store, but similar ones at a different store. I would like them to be around the same price and available at a store, not just online.       The reason why I don't want them from Target, is because if you read those reviews, you'll see that they aren't the best quality. But I really like them.       Oh and I'm pretty sure it's possible to get better quality shoes for the same price. If I got to the right store.       So please don't answer with something like "If you want better quality, then you need to pay a higher price." Thanks. Please leave links if you can and store names. Thank you.

20090202153555AA8jQ76	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Easter outfit? 10 points to best answer.?	Can some one please make me an easter outfit.... I really want a dress and want to look cute for easter. i am 14, tall, have brown hair and green eyes. I like almost any thing. I especially love the colors pink, green, white, baby blue, navy blue, and white. I love almost any store, but my favs are delias, forever 21, charlote ruse, american eagle, and pac sun (but that wouldn't really have anything dressy enough for easter). Also since it is for church, if you could find a sweater or something to keep it a little modest. I also love accessories :D Thanks so much and 10 points to best answer.

20090202163729AAile4o	Beauty & Style;Hair	What kind of hairstyle should I have (guy)?	Right now I have longish hair.  It looks pretty much exactly like Anakin from episode 3 of Star Wars except shorter.  I just put product in it and mess it up.  I kinda like the messy look, but I wanted to know what other people think.  Do you like Anakin's hair from episode 3?      And if you don't, what kind of hairstyle should I get?  Now before you suggest, know that short hair doesn't work for me.  People have said this.  There are actually a few reasons for this.  For one, I have a long nose.  I also have a square jaw and an inclining forehead (more than most people). Plus, I can't grow actual sideburns in front of the ears, and if I have long hair I can just put that over the ears, but if I have short hair there isn't any hair (or sideburns) in front of my ears.      One short hairstyle that worked ok was to put stuff in it and mess it up, so it would be spiky and messy.        And again...my hair is like Anakin's...so if it's short, then it looks strait, but as it gets longer it gets wavy and then it starts to curl.      But let me know if my current Anakin hairstyle works.  I know I don't have a picture, but it pretty much just looks like Anakin's.  Do you think his hair looks good?

I want to get a Brazilian wax, and although I've been doing my own bikini waxes sporadically throughout my life, I've never gotten it all taken off before.      I am hesitant mainly because my skin is really sensitive. The first (and only) time I got a professional bikini wax, the lady pushed too hard on my skin I guess and I ended up with a huge bruise (It wasn't even a sketchy place or anything!) So ever since I've done them myself.      So I'm scared my skin like won't be able to handle it. Has anyone ever had a major problem with getting Brazilian waxes? Do you know if some people's skin just can't handle it? Or will I be fine if I take some Tylenol and have a glass of wine (kidding... kind of)?

Now I don't have time at night to do the whole clip-pin thing to my hair so I need something simple. This maybe impossible but worth asking.

20090202165819AANnTQJ	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Skin tight clothing (but no cleavage) on people with big breasts?	The typical bottoms: jeans, skirts, pants.    I'm just wondering about the top. I think that anyone who is not quite thin shouldn't wear skin tight clothing because it is verrrry unflattering. I think that tight tops look almost vulgar on heavier people. Loose tops and blouses are so much more flattering and look much prettier.      And on thin girls, tight clothing looks almost natural and not obvious that it's skin tight. They have the option, for the most part, of wearing tight aaaand loose tops without looking vulgar.      However, I am very lean and thin on the stomach but I have pretty large breasts. Is it still okay for me to wear tight tops? They would still be classy and show no cleavage... but still tight, therefore it doooes emphasize my boobs compared to looser tops and blouses.      What do you think? I just don't want to look the least bit vulgar, yet I don't like loose tops and blouses and, with my larger breasts, it doesn't flatter me so much unless I wear a belt or tuck it in.      Any opinions/advice would be very helpful.   By the way, I DID NOT mean to offend anyone by asking this question.      Thank you!

I just want my bangs back to that length.      I'm using Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths 2 in 1 right now.   Will that help my bangs grow longer?      Or is there any other shampoos/conditioners (or any kinda of hair product) that'll make my bangs back to that length in the second picture?      My hair grows a little faster than average,    Soooo.   Basically my two questions are -      How long will it take to grow my bangs out while using hair growth products.   AND.

Here is a link to the ring and details.       http://www.beaverbrooks.co.uk/index.cfm?...       Unfortunately me and my fiance split up and she gave me the ring back. I have had it all cleaned etc so it is basically brand new.      Theres no chance me and her will get back together so I have decided to sell it and put the money towards a holiday to clear my head.      Does anyone have any idea how much I would be able to sell the ring for (Approx)? Or would it be better to hold onto it?   Thanks.

I recently got my hair cut, it just barely rests on my shoulders (It used to be in the middle of my back) so I'm not all that creative when it comes to shorter hair styles. The girl who cut it put quite a few layers in it and a lot of texture. I typically just straighten it or put it in a pony tail, and I'm wanting something a little different. Does anyone know some good hair styles that would go with my length of hair? Video tutorials would be great!

Gross orange-looking girls who over fake tan (yes im talking to you) are so outdated dont you think? A lot more celebrities are rocking a more natural look, or even turning to a paler complexion. My prediction is pale will be the new tan very soon.   Same with big boobs. Theyre not trendy like how they used to be. Most stars now have smaller breasts, or a more natural look.   im glad that fake trashy looking style is starting to go arent you?

20090202203350AA8MqDQ	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	How much do you pay for tattoos?	Now, I have seen people answering questions saying they pay $75 or even $60 an hour for tattoo work, and I am having a super hard time figuring this out.  I've never talked to a tattoo artist who charged less than $125 an hour!      I live in Georgia, and I'm not sure if it's because I go to more well known, accomplished artists and studios, but if anybody can show me the portfolio of someone who charges $75-$100 an hour, I would be mad interested to see it.      I'm not saying the artists some of you have been talking about are bad, necessarily, but I really can't grasp prices that cheap!  Please don't just make stuff up, and if you could let me know at least the name of the shop you went to and either got a tattoo or asked about prices, that'd be sweet.

I know it doesn't fit in this category but please read it: I really need advise!    okay so i have this friend (best friend). and there was this guy (lets call him steve) that like always talked to her all the time. then around new years I started talking to Steve. when i say talking i mean texting. so anyway, we were texting each-other 24 seven. then Steve finally straight up told us he liked us BOTH! so he asked out my friend. she said no (for the eighth time). he was crushed. now they rarely talk and i guess Steve likes me now. I'm not sure if i like him or not. I'm thinking that even if i did like him, it wouldn't work out cause he really really liked my best friend (enough to ask her out eight times!) okay so i don't know if i should move on or i should wait to see if something happens in our relationship. what should i do?     if you have any questions I'll answer them in an edit. thank you guys so much!!

Please dont say more wishes cause well that's pretty much what all of us would wish for.       ok so here is my wishes...   #1 I wish that all men would be happy with only having one woman to love   #2 I wish that woman would respect their bodies more and stop feeling like they should advertise themselves in order to be seen because girls who put pictures of their bodies on line and wear skimpy clothes in public gives real woman a bad name. You dont need to wear nothing to be beautiful.   #3 I wish that life will grant everyone more happiness than sadness.         I made these wishes because i hate seeing my friends hurt by guys who cheats. I was always very spoilt and hated for it but i understand why and i think everyone should have the chance to enjoy what i have. I also feel sad for girls who do bad things for attention. I dont understand why being under the spotlight is so important im so sick of the attention and being the most talked about girl in a room honestly i wouldn't wish that upon anyone. Oh and see i respect myself and still have lots of friends, still have a fiance and are very happy maybe everyone can try a bit more and love and respect themselves more.

My legs would be smooth for less than a day and then I could start to feel the hair coming in and my legs would feel prickly. I tried Nads cold wax and an epilator and although they both remove the hair my legs still don't feel smooth. If I keep waxing will this go away with time? Or is there something better I could be using? Obviously my hair is very coarse and stubborn...my skin is also quite sensitive I should mention.    Thanks

20090202193714AA8GHrM	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Swimwear, speedos and haters?	I'm a late 30's guy. I'm slim, athletic, 6 feet tall, very clean cut, never treat women like objects and since I was a little boy, always dreamed of getting married.  I grew up with SUCH strong romantic feelings for women.  At puberty, I began to be self aware.  I began to notice how, in tight jeans, you could see a bulge.  I felt sexy, but wasn't into ego trips or being lustful.        Then it happened.  In my late teens, I became aware of the fact that guys in high school and college (and elsewhere), were wearing these ultra revealing things called speedos.  Here's the key thing;  I noticed they were wearing these things that looked like underwear and showed more detail of the male sex organ than you see in an R rated movie....in non-sexual situations, in front of females.  Instantly, this said to me that I can forget feeling sexy and good about myself sexually, because guys can wear these tiny revealing speedos in front of women (and young women, who are supposedly interested in guys and sex), and they become oblivious.  This is especially true of female swimmers.  What's worse, the females who see athletic guys in speedos, are not only indifferent, but they laugh or think it's gross.     For 20 years...20 summers, I've worn speedos to the beach, keeping it from anyone who knows me, to TRY and see reactions from women out of the corner of my eye.  I look online, go to chat rooms, read articles, and ask female acquaintances who are not wise as to why I'm asking, and the consensus is what I feared....women are oblivious, grossed out, or thin it's funny.      Now, I know you'll want to doll out advice like "Forget what others think", or "Women just aren't visual".  But the bottom line is I have felt UTTERLY devistated for 20 years.  I just got married.  Despite what my wife says, I don't believe her.  She "is" female, and females feel as I described.  So, I don't want to have sex at all, because it's like living a lie.  I KNOW that women like sex only for closeness, to feel good, to please their guy and they enjoy the male organ in those respects, and only as it offers them a reflection of their own attractiveness when it's aroused.  But do women find a bulge or what's underneath intrinsically sexy or a turn on when its attached to a fit guy?  No.     Go to voyforums, or Yahoo singles discussions or countless other message boards, where I changed my name and/or age to try to discuss this to maybe get female responses to change my mind.  I was blasted from all sides by female speedo haters.  Imagine a GUY telling women he finds long board shorts more attractive on them than bikinis?  Absurd.  Yet, women say they prefer board shorts.     I can't LOOK at a picture of a swim meet, where guys are in speedos and females are there too (swimmers), because I know I've read and heard directly how after a while they don't even notice the guys bulges.     Please note that I'm leaving out lots of info, and please know I'm 6 feet tall, about 175 pounds, very athletic, not hairy, and am "normal" down there.  Besides, it's not about me, it's about women, who I grew up having such strong feelings for, and their attitude towards guys in general.     An article in a young women's magazine, a few years ago, BY a female, was about the movie Swimfan.  In her article, she mentioned being on the set on a day when guys weren't in speedos, but followed by writing "..don't be grossed out ladies, it's for their roles".  Even in ARTICLES it's a given that the more of us that shows, the grosser we are.      This summer, I'll be secretly out there again on a New England beach, walking in speedos, hoping to see SOME look or overhear SOME comment that might help change my mind about how I feel women think of us.        Whoever reads this, I will tell you that 20 years of my life has been ruined!  You have no idea.  I showed a girl in college once (when I was in college), a pic of the yearbook swim team...just casually to see her reaction.  I was HOPING she'd go "Oh my gosh..I can't believe guys wear those.  They show so much".  Or..."Oh wow...we girls LOVE looking at this page", or something.  Instead, she saw the guys in speedos and went "Eww, arent they ugly in those?"  I could go on with countless experiences like that.  I guess if I didn't have such romantic feelings for women, I wouldn't care.  But I do, and have been UTTERLY devistated for years.      I'm a Christian, but now look at porn every night, engage in disgusting chat, and even want guys to look at me just to get some sense of reassurance that guys and guy's bulges are sexually attractive.  Sounds crazy, but I'm not.  I'm popular, and a class clown type.  But crushed inside.  All these years, and I feel this is ruling my life, and I feel utterly hurt by women.  Any positive or hopeful comments, I'm leerogers27@yahoo.com

We can wear shorts, destroyed jeans, flip flops, shorts & we can wear piercings and color our hair an unnatural color.   I'm not really interested in the piercings and unnatural hair color thing but what do you think would be a cute outfit to wear?   I'm in the north, so shorts probably would be the best pick. I'm thinking destroyed jeans, flip flops, and a cute top. What do you guys think?   Any cute ideas? Polyvore outfits? Let me know, I found a pair of jeans with holes in NWT for about $20 so I think I'll purchase them since I don't own any destroyed jeans that currently fit me.   Thanks<3

20090202131732AAKFS85	Beauty & Style;Hair	Dying brown hair red...not with box dye?	Not gonna lie, I'm pretty amazing at dying hair and foiling and all that jazz, and I've dyed my hair lots of colors black, blonde, tons of shades of brown....but never ever red cuz it'd look horrid on me (tan, dark brown eyebrows)....but my friend really wants to go red again, and wants me to dye her hair. We've been looking at what kind of red she wants...and I'm hoping that someone can help me with what base/level to use. I usually use the stuff at sally's.   I'm not even sure what color developer to use when dying hair red. Her hair is a medium brown color with some thin blonde highlights.  This might sound like something to leave to the professionals, but honestly I've been dying my hair for about 8 years...and I've gotten really good at dying it and foiling my own hair...i foil other peoples hair and everything...so I'm not like way out of my league here.      Okay so something like one of these is the color we are trying to achieve:    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v352/m...     http://www.digital-photo.com.au/gallery/...     http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v352/m...          her hair right now is kind of like this::    http://evilbeetgossip.film.com/wp-conten...    medium brown with some blonde in it      She wants to have it like ^ that pic but where theres brown, have it red instead. I wanna do very very thin highlights on top but chunky ones underneath...just not sure what to do for the red. I know the reds I put aren't all the same shade but I'm jw about what level and base I should be using and what volume of developer...
