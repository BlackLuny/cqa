0maJCeLCaa	yes :)
doz7RIoeaa	PETA IS pathetic so what do you expect?     After sex, people want to eat. How many ham or cheese or ham and cheese sandwiches were made after people had sex? Gallons of milk drunk? PETA didn't seem to realize that.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	I would love to run peta. I would make some serious adjustments.     I would certainly change how the company markets vegetarianism. there are so many other ways to get people to consider vegetarianism other than pestering people and sending out peta memebers in leaf bikinis.    like for example, making a delicous vegan dish, and handing out free samples and vegetarian brochures to passers by.|`|DauMaNUjaa	PETA knew the commercial wouldn't get onto the superbowl, they did it on purpose. Now people hear about the "banned PETA commercial" go to their WEBSITE and watch it. PETA hopes that they will look around a little bit more on the website. This was their plan all along. They don't have to pay for airtime, and get people on their website. They did it last year as well.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Peta is playing itself out of the market.  People are disgusted with their antics.  They are doing more damage to animals then good.  It became a cult of fanatics.    Support the Humane Society.|`|jezA7yqtaa	They should be ashamed!  What does "sex" have to do with vegetarism?   They went to far this time.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Lol, yes it was pretty stupid! What I think is stupider is they accepted Paris Hilton's "sexy" commercial but not PETA's. Plus, PETA knew they wouldn't accept it, and knew it'd give it even more publicity|`|1c76b6914c5a81657e108fb7a9d57143aa	I'm a vegetarian. Its true vegetarians do have better sex ;)   Just kidding. Well, not really. Anyway, its pretty raunchy. I think they actually wanted it to get banned. Think about it, they didn't have to pay for their commercial to be on television yet its getting all this press. People are curious why it got banned so they go and watch it and PETA gets a ton of media attention.  Their not forcing their views on anyone. Their making a commercial about their opinion on vegetarianism.|`|AA12334360	PETA cannot afford to buy a superbowl advert.    So, what they do is make one that cannot be shown so they get just as much publicity about it without having to pay any advertising bill.    Questions, comments and even insults all add fuel to thier publicity fire and they love it. Simply put, you have done what they wanted you to do by spreading the word. Yahoo search engine now picks up your question and raises the profile even more.    PETA are irrelavent to me, i don't know why so many people get hung up about moaning about them. Either do something about them, or don't. But moaning about them is exactly what they want - publicity for free.    The message that "veggies have better sex" is irelavent. Thats not thier aim. Their aim is to raise awareness of PETA and get people to visit thier website for more information - they suceeded ( with your help ! )    I wold put your energy into positive organisations and ignore PETA.    If you are concerned about farm animal welfare may i suggest you look at VIVA ?|`|AA10438532	i don't agree with peta's message. if you want to be a vegan that's cool but don't try to force your views on me. i do think the add was brilliant tho. they knew it would be banned but all the news programs were running it and talking about it so they got the message to millions without the cost of the tv ad.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	lol. You have to admit, it's kind of funny. And it's kinda hitting the nail on the head with the whole "Audience" thing - during a super bowl? Millions of angry, adrenaline pumped men? And then these 3 hot ladies pop up with vegetables... Atleast PETA are trying!     On a more serious note though, it was kinda of cheesy, silly and perverted in a sense. I mean, come on PETA, do something a bit classy for once. =/.    If I was a straight meat-eating male, then I don't think I would turn to vegetarianism as soon as I saw that add - it would've made me laugh...

jFO2lBrUaa	The cake might take a little longer too cook due to it being gluten free, it doesn't have the same consistency as normal cake mix due to the flour being different. Just make sure to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn - I recently discovered that Dove's farm now make a gluten free self raising flour, and I've been using that too make cakes with, all you do is use it like normal flour, and it's less expensive than cake mix too, so if you can get it I'd recommend that over a the pre-mix packets!    Most frosting's are gluten free but you have to be really careful, as some do have gluten in them, to bulk them out a little. It's probably safest to buy one that is branded gluten free, that way you won't run the risk of making your mother in law ill!    Good luck with the cake and happy birthday to your mother in law!|`|aFK7yD4xaa	Haha. Yes, manufacturers love to "add value" by saying something is "whatever free" even if it is normally that way! Otoh, at least you didn't have to check the ingredients label. Reminds me of a time when I was in a supermarket behind a couple of women. One picked up a loaf of bread and said "This one says it's suitable for vegetarians" and the other one said "Oh! Well we had better buy that one, then" - ever seen meat products in a loaf of bread?    Anyhoo. Gluten free mixes tend to take up more liquid than others, so I guess it will be ok. Doubtless you will know by now. It may take longer to cook, as well, depending on the mix. Hope you will say what brand it was and how it turned out. A lot of gluten free stuff is not very good, so all data is useful.|`|ixOE0onnaa	oh the cake huh? that's so good. but mix them eww

287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Here are two recipes: a hot pilaf and a cool summer tabbouleh salad.    Bulgur Pilaf  Ingredients:  1 cup of unprepared bulgur  2 cups of chicken stock  ? can of tomato paste (optional)  ? cup olive oil  salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste  Preparation:  1. In a covered skillet, heat the olive oil until hot, but not burning.    2. Add the dry bulgur and gently toast the kernels until the oil is absorbed  but not so long as the bulgur begins to burn.    3. Add the chicken stock and the tomato paste (if desired) and bring to a boil.    4. Cover the skillet tightly, reduce the heat and cook as you would rice  on a low heat, until all the liquid is absorbed, and the bulgur is softened  but NOT too mushy.    5. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Fluff a bit with a fork, and serve hot.    NOTE: Adding vegetables, like chopped onions of scallions, sweet peppers, minced carrots, mushrooms, peas, celery and chopped potatoes  and/or herbs like chopped parsley or even mint, makes this a complete meal. This is also excellent to serve with Tass Kebab or Shish Kebab.    Tabbouleh  Ingredients:  1 cup of unprepared bulgur  About a quart of salted water  ? cup EACH of finely chopped parsley, mint, cucumbers, scallions, and tomatoes  About 1/8  ? cup of lemon juice (to taste)  About ? - ? cup of extra virgin olive oil (to taste)  Salt and pepper to taste  Preparation:  1. In a deep bowl, place the dry bulgur and pour the salted water over it. Cover and let it stand for AT LEAST an hour  or until the bulgur has softened and can be easily chewed. Usually, the water will be absorbed. If the liquid is absorbed, and the bulgur is still crunchy, simply add more water and let it stand a bit longer.    2. Take the soaked bulgur up by the fistful and tightly squeeze the grains to remove ALL the excess water, placing each fistful in a clean bowl. (If you dont get all the excess water, the finished product will be soggy).    3. Add the chopped herbs and vegetables to the bowl, along with the olive oil and the lemon juice. Season and mix well  the salad will be more or less lemony and dressed with olive oil, according to your taste  but as the salad sits and chills, the oil and lemon will be more absorbed.    4. Chill and serve. If the salad looks too dry, feel free to add a bit more olive oil over the top before coming to the table.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	you can cook it up as a very nutritious whole grain hot cereal  make tabbouli  add some cooked bulgur to your next batch of chili or sloppy joes to stretch the meat|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	We use Bulgur all the time    My wife is Lebanese    Over the course of a month, we make Lentils and Wheat, tabouleh,  and Kibby (Ground Lamb or Beef with Wheat)    I also make a bulgur pilaf|`|XHnpraaxaa	Do a web search and sure you will get many ideas.

AA10025824	If it was that small of a bottle it would be less alcohol than taking most cold medicines.

That is the equivalent of one bar drink of alcohol and it was split among how ever many pina coladas were served. The amount of alcohol per drink was very small, so you probably wouldn't notice much or any effect from it.|`|5whQgw8Zaa	small bottles are good for like 1-2 people at least good enough to get them drunk.|`|JRpD7Yu5aa	Its unlikely that someone would feel effects from half a shot of alcohol.

dkAsJRboaa	I'm in college, so the days i do cook the easiest things are    pasta- with either marinara sauce or alfredo. and i add either chicken(boiled), ground beef or shrimp(the ones that come cooked), and if i have some cheese i put some over it and melt it in the microwave.    rice- white or stew with any meat    mashed potatoes with oven chicken and i buy the McCormick gravy its really fast.    there's lots of other thing you can do really fast, one tip: if you have a recipe you can skip most of the secondary ingredients so it will be faster, another tip: if you are going to cook something that's frozen take it out of the fridge in the morning so it will be thawed when you get back and therefore easier to cook|`|SUs4rN49aa	Cooking food in college really isn't that time consuming. Stir fry is super fast to make, boil 5 minute rice and pick up a bag of ready to eat vegetables, fry them up in a frying pan add soy sauce and garlic.   Spaghetti, pretty easy. Chili, soups, stew.. all can be made. Mashed potatoes, vegetables, a portion of protein.   In college, you will just have to work around your schedule, if you have classes until 5pm or so, just prepare some foods before you start class.. like peel potatoes in the morning and then put them in the fridge in water when you are ready to prepare supper.|`|U5gixzszaa	well u probeley have a cafeteria there
AwAw0uiKaa	It's never a smart idea to leave chicken, raw or cooked, in a fridge. Freezing it lasts longer.

pIlIEgqoaa	Covering with foil is a steaming effect assuming you have about 1 inch of liquid in the baking dish. I would reduce the temperature to prevent scorching and the risk of the peppers collapsing. Placing the pepper lid on top during the cooking process assists.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Do you have a large lid or a small cookie sheet that you could cover it with?  I just finished my unstuffed pepper soup and it was so so good.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It should be ok.  The foil keeps the moisture in and helps steam the pepper (I assume you have water in the bottom of the pan).  You could also put them into a big casserole dish that has a lid though|`|B2duikyaaa	it'l be fine to leave uncovered.|`|4DBGRU8Kaa	Not a problem if you microwave the empty peppers first until they start to feel tender.

Peel, mince and crush garlic. Add to skillet when the chiles begin to turn color; do not allow garlic to brown. Add quartered onions, cooking only until slightly translucent (this takes the "bite" off).

Two Pepper Salsa: Green or red bell peppers, quartered and seeded, may be added when all ingredients are transferred to food processor, if desired.    Roast Garlic Chile Salsa: To make a roast garlic version, dip an entire head of unpeeled garlic in olive oil and wrap it in aluminum foil. Roast in oven for 40 minutes at 350F.

2zHq2XIMaa	They are both terrible for your health and teeth.    Coke is bad because it has way too much sugar and caffeine in it.    Diet coke is bad because they replace the sugar with sweeteners and the name is misleading as it actually stimulates your appetite causing you to want to eat more.      Coca cola would be bankrupt long ago if people had asked more questions about what they were putting into their bodies.|`|mH5jEhbHaa	They both are bad for you.Because they both have corn syrup in them.Juice is the best way to go.|`|6e34f1c3efbd3d63fb5b79e4334e8388aa	Oh it's so hard to decide.    The Coke has high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). There are many studies which show that it links to diabetes and rapid weight gain, unlike natural sugars which are metabolized differently than HFCS. If that's not bad enough, now it contains Mercury! (see link below from USA Today).    Diet Coke of course contains aspartame. This chemical sweetener has proved to cause major neurological damages with long term use. It's said to be linked to Alzheimer's. I could go on...    Either one in an aluminum can will have traces of aluminum as an added bonus. Aluminum has also been found to cause neurological damage as well.     Which is worse? You tell me. The choice is clear, drink water!|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	People hate sugar (coke) but I distrust chemical sweeteners in diet drinks. Nobody knows the long term effects of these substances. Sugar, it's simple honest and I understand it. I'd go for sugar every time.  Moderation in everything is the key. No one thing is the enemy.

AA10137828	Put coarse sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper on a plate.    Pat each side of the steak into that to give a good coating.    Put the steak on the pre heated, very hot griddle (use a bit of olive oil first) and leave alone for four minutes.    Turn over for another four minutes.    Put two tablespoons of butter in the pan and cook each side another minute.    Remove the steaks, add two cups of red wine to pan to de glaze it. Allow this to reduce to about 1/2 it's volume then ladle over the steaks.    No A1 or other stuff will be needed!|`|XHnpraaxaa	Grease the grill and heat it on a fairly high heat than toss the meat on it and cook it the way you like it.  I do about 6 minutes per side.

The defining characteristics of Westphalian pumpernickel are coarse rye flourrye mealand an exceedingly long baking period. The long slow baking is what gives pumpernickel its characteristic dark color. The bread can emerge from the oven deep brown, even black. Like most all-rye breads, pumpernickel is traditionally made with a sourdough starter; the acid preserves the bread structure by inactivating the highly active rye amylases.    Only cheaters and lazy people add cocoa powder, brown sugar, coffee or molasses to obtain the dark brown color.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpernicke...|`|hYohgOcAaa	its bread, has no seeds inside or out, its black brown (u now dark)  its good with butter, ummm.....it has a weird tasty feeling when u eat it... its good but i find white, freanch or semolina bread way better

If they are smoking Marlboro Reds, thinking that those are a macho brand, you can let them know that those were originally introduced by Phillip Morris as a ladies cigarette for the ladies market.    American Spirit has another advantage over almost every other kind of cigarette: they are composed of nothing but pure tobacco.  There are no additives, no flavor-enhancers, no nicotine-tweakers, or any other of the 4,000 FDA-approved chemicals that are allowed to be introduced into the tobacco of US cigarette manufacturers.  Marlboro Lights alone has 101 different chemicals added to its formula.  So with American Spirit, you are addicted ONLY to nicotine, and not to any of these other added chemicals or to the effects some of these chemicals they are designed to have on your body's absorbtion of nicotine.|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	i like them|`|o68zqSZkaa	I have smoked natural spirit for ages.

Only an insecure and really depressed, person who is obviously acting out and need attention would say that. You are turning 13 and I think that you should invite all your close friends over, put on a CD of your top 25 fav. songs. Do some karaoke, maybe a murder mystery game party, do a carnival themed party and give tickets and numbered ticket prizes. Have a dance off, if its early enough...have a "Man hunt" with a list of objects, play the balloon pop game ( where you have a team of boys vs girls and you have a bin of balloons and you run to the end and sit on a balloon and pop it and run back...etc.) Break out the Wii ( if you have one) do a "Medival Intrigue" or a "Medival Madness Party" , or do the basic jenga, twister, and monoploly games.

0ujpiBTCaa	Read "Dominion"! A great take on this topic.    Jesus lived in a very different time than we do. Death is not evil, eating meat is not immoral. Causing terrible suffering and death for our own enjoyment only, that is immoral in my view. People in His time ate what was available.   You do not need to eat meat. So, when you say, "I think I will have a hamburger. It is okay that this animal was kept captive, suffered and died just so I can enjoy this burger" it is VERY different than Jesus catching and eating a fish.    Also, Adam and Eve were vegetarian until their fall. I think this speaks to God's view on things.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	in my opinion, it is not a sin to eat meat. i believe the bible can be interpreted either way when it comes to eating meat. at first god clearly says that all creatures are meant to eat all green plants. but once sin was created later in the bible it says what meats are clean and what are unclean to eat. also there is a verse that says not to judge a man by his diet or some along those lines.     the only way i can think of my veganism being tied in with my religion is that my religion is quaker, meaning i have been raised with more pacifist views, i hate violence the less of it better. by eating meat or any dairy products im supporting unnecessary violence. it is something that i refuse to support. i also believe that gods creatures should be treated with respect which factory farms do not do.    and about meat tasting good, i bet cannibals could say the same.|`|7E2kGw2naa	Not everyone takes the bible literally.    "Also, if meat is not meant to be consumed, then why did God make it taste good and give us good nourishment?"

I am also a vegetarian, and a strong believer as well.     Not everything that is pleasurable is necessarily good and holy, per say. God created animals and humans, and it's true that we humans rein over the animals. I believe however, that if we are above animals, we should also be above animals in our morals.     God is above us, and you don't see HIM eating people. Animals were given many similarities to humans, such as feelings, emotions, families. I don't think humans should destroy lives if there is healthier, easier and friendlier alternatives.     By the way... humans taste good too, and we don't kill them and eat them ;)|`|NNiN0tK0aa	The early texts about Jesus (which are mostly ignored or covered up by the Church) say Jesus belonged to a religious sect called the Nazarenes.  The Nazarenes were a group of Essenes.  They practised vegetarianism but not veganism - they drank raw goats milk.  And used pure diets and fasting and other natural healing methods to treat people with diseases.  The Church claims "Jesus the Nazarene" means Jesus of Nazareth but there was no such place as Nazareth.  Christians named the present day Nazareth, as Nazareth, because there wasn't one.    The don't want you to know that Jesus followers were the Nazarenes, not the Christians....who were the followers of Paul.  They also don't want you to know Jesus was vegetarian because then they would have to be....and most people don't want to be.  The miracle of the loaves and the fishes was probably a parable, or symbolic.  2 Fishes was the symbol of Nazareanism.  The followers of Paul adopted the Cross as their symbol.    Bread was a symbol of knowledge, fish were a symbol of wisdom/inspiration/prophecy.  Jesus fed their minds and their souls.|`|dBVtmrpIaa	Who is Jesus?|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	I am not a Christian but I did read the old testament in my literature class and adam and eve did not eat meat until he ate the apple -- sin was created.    the bible can't be used as a source for everything.

hImPK5peaa	it's for the 2.5 oz packages    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Battle Creek, MI  February 2, 2009 -- As a result of the expansion of Peanut Corporation of Americas recall to include all peanut ingredients produced in their Blakely, Georgia facility since Jan. 1, 2007, Kellogg Company has issued a voluntary nationwide recall for the following products:    Keebler? Soft Batch Homestyle Chocolate Chunk Cookies and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, 2.5-ounce size only, with a Best If Used Before date prior to June 30, 2009 (06 30 9), with the following UPC codes: 3010032708, 3010037899.   Special K Protein? Meal Bar Honey Almond variety only, 6-count and 8-count packages, with a Best If Used Before date prior to February 1, 2010 (FEB 01 2010), with the following UPC codes: 3800039778, 3800039935, 3800039931.    No other Special K? products are part of this recall. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection to the above products.   Although these products do not contain any peanut ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America, they were produced at another companys facility on the same line as products that were made for other companies using potentially contaminated PCA ingredients. For that reason, this voluntary recall is being issued out of an abundance of caution.     Also as a result of Peanut Corporation of Americas expanded recall, the January 16, 2009 Kellogg Company recall of Austin? and Keebler? Peanut Butter Sandwich Crackers and select snack-size packs of Famous Amos? Peanut Butter Cookies and Keebler? Soft Batch Homestyle Peanut Butter Cookies is now expanded to include all code dates.  Retailers had previously been advised to remove all of these products from store shelves, regardless of code date, so the vast majority of these recalled products are no longer in the marketplace, but consumers having any of these products in their homes are urged to destroy them.      Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Website at http://www.cdc.gov.      Consumers who have purchased the recalled products are urged to destroy them. Consumers with questions or who would like a refund may contact 877-869-5633. Consumers with questions or concerns about their health should contact their doctor.

Cooking Directions  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Put a kettle of water on to heat for the water bath. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Wrap the outside bottom of the pan with a double thickness of foil.  To prepare crust: Blend crumbs, sugar, oil and coffee in a small bowl with a fork or your fingertips. Press into the bottom of the pan.  To prepare filling: Puree cottage cheese in a food processor until very smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides. Add cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cocoa and cornstarch. Process until smooth. Add egg, egg whites, coffee, vanilla, salt and chocolate and blend well. Pour into the crust-lined pan.  Place the cheesecake in a roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come 1/2 inch up the side of the springform pan.  Bake the cheesecake until the edges are set but the center still jiggles, about 50 minutes. Turn off the oven. Spray a knife with cooking spray and run it around the edge of the pan. Let stand in the oven, with the door ajar, for 1 hour. Transfer from the water bath to a wire rack; remove foil. Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Refrigerate, uncovered, until chilled.  Before serving, garnish the cheesecake with chocolate-covered coffee beans, if using.   Yield: 16 servings    Oh my gosh!

Preheat oven to 350F.  Place unwrapped hard candies in a heavy plastic bag,.  Place the bag inside folded towel and crush candies into small chunks with a meat tenderizing mallet or small hammer.  Remove candy wrappers and put crushed candy in a small bowl.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and wipe it with a VERY VERY THIN layer of veg oil.  Place cookie cutters on foil, at least 2 to 3 inches apart.  Divide crushed candies evenly among cutters, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp per lollipop. (Candy layer should be 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.)(Optional - Add small decorative candies, such as cookie sprinkles, or edible candied flower petals to crushed candies. If using flower petals, make sure they are covered with a layer of the crushed candy.)  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes or until candies are completely melted.  Cool for 30 seconds.  Remove cookie cutters with tongs, allowing melted candy to spread just slightly.  Quickly attach a stick to base of each lollipop (twist the stick to cover lollipop end with melted candy).  Cool completely.  Peel foil from lollipops.    Lick away!

So she said she was turning vegetarian, is it really your responsibility to "tell her off"? I'm sure she's well aware she's eating dead animals, otherwise, why would she eat them? Perhaps she was merely seeking attention; and she was sure new "fad" she was adopting would bring it to her. Well, it caught your attention, didn't it?     I don't think you're being very mature at all. How can anyone say: "I don't really like her that much anyways, so I should go and tell her what she's doing is wrong by her own standards". Grow up mate. And I doubt she's lived off meat for ever. God forbid should my mother feed my T-Bone steaks when I was 1 year old, or even a foetus! :)|`|i2jNoGIKaa	maybe she was starting tomorrow?

Cut the squash evenly in half. Scoop out the seeds and discard them. Stab the squash all over with a fork, being careful not to pierce the outside of the skin. Roll some of the meat into a ball that would fit nicely where the seeds were at. Put the meat into the little bowl in the squash. Put squash in the middle of a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap tightly. Cook at about 425. Squash will be done when you stick a fork into the squash and it slides in and out easily. When finished, I prefer to eat the meat by itself. Then I throw some butter into the squash "bowl" and start mixing the squash with the butter inside the skin. I don't recommend eating the skin.

Drain the noodles and cut into 3-inch lengths. Divide the noodles among individual bowls and ladle the soup over the top.    Tip: You can find cellophane and rice noodles in the Asian-food aisle of most supermarkets.

Yield: Makes 4 servings             Chickpea Hot Pot Recipe    Leftovers are going to thicken up ovenight - thin with a bit of water/stock while reheating, and adjust for seasoning again.

Taste, and add salt if necessary. Serve garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and red onions.    Serves 4 - 6.
WK0CS26Yaa	taste, price and alcohol volume Other than that there really isn't any difference at all|`|CUD2Vmy3aa	Beer has less alcohol and takes more to get you smashed. Other liquers are stronger and dont take as much to get you smashed because they have a higher percent of alchohol in them. You can still get pretty hammered with beer but since your drinking more liquid you might throw up/ have to piss more.|`|AA10276489	http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...|`|HghbvVZgaa	Beer is created by the fermentation of hops    Most Liquors are created by the distilling of potatoes (for vodka),   grapes (for brandies and cognacs)

wVJ1jAyJaa	Turkish tea is no different than other black teas.  It's preparation is different, that's all.  If you do not have any allergies to black tea, then, no, it will not have a bad effect on you.  However, some Turks like to drink their teas "strong", if I were you, I'd begin with it's lighter version. Because when drunk late at night, strong tea can cause sleeplessness.  If someone serves you tea in Turkey, just tell them to prepare it "light" (it's Turkish is "a??k ?ay"/light tea)|`|4Pk6VNftaa	I don't see why it would...

AA10740562	Why does everyone here have multiple thumbs down on their answers? It seems to me you screwed up by adding too much pepper, and with that, there isn't much you can do that won't affect the overall taste of the soup. Everything may calm down too much pepper, but would add another flavor altogether. It won't be the same as if the right amount of pepper was added. I agree with the first answer. Make more soup the same way you made your original too peppery soup, but without the pepper. (I assume you mean the ground black pepper) then mix some of the soup with too much pepper with some without the pepper. Another negative review? Then go get a life!|`|XHnpraaxaa	Add more stock or try adding more veggies.  I love pepper so it would not be to much ever for me.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	taking spices out is always a difficult thing...    perhaps try, taking out half the broth and adding some fresh water..with fresh bullion and let it simmer...|`|TiUkZEUiaa	feed the sinky with half of a soup and top it up with another stock mind the pepper if still fail just add more paper so that you will remember the next time you do it.,|`|6dhPV3Cbaa	Adding a potato to foods while they're cooking can take out excess spiciness.  I would think it would also work for pepper.  Also, adding a bit of sugar may help to neutralize the pepper.|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	I had to research this one a bit (a potato will help with too much salt, sugar will balance some things out, including the acidity of tomatoes, etc. ... but not pepper).  Here is what I found, and it makes total sense.  Hope it helps ;)      "Q:  Can a cook repair a soup or stew if too much hot pepper or other spice has been added?    A:  A dollop of sour cream or yogurt can mellow the spicy flavor. Adding a can of sweet corn also can help."    NOTE:  I often add corn to my soups, and it is delicious!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Read on ~ your question is addressed:    "SOUP OR STEW TOO SALTY (read on ~ this does apply)    Make sure you never measure seasonings right over the pot or bowl. It's just too easy for your hand to slip, the cat to run under your legs, or someone to startle you. If it's already happened, we used to think that adding a raw cut up potato added to the soup would absorb much of the additional salt, but recent research has disproven this. Really the only way to diminish the salt is to add more of the other ingredients to the soup; in other words, add more of every ingredient except the salt. This is also the only way to fix recipes when you've added too much hot sauce, Tabasco, cayenne pepper, or chilies. "    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Unless you make another batch and add, this is my next recommendation, and the best way to look at it is that you have pre-made a starter for a future dish (which sucks, but at least it is not a total loss). :    "treat the mistake as a product and use the flaw as a strength. Your soup has lots of nice leeks and potatoes and cream, but way too much pepper? Theres a whole family of recipes for things like chicken casserole which call for a can of cream soup. (Classically, they call for chicken velout or bchamel, but your mom used Campbells Cream Of Mushroom. Listen to Mom. After all, who added all that pepper?) You make the same thing, but instead of canned soup youre going to use a wonderful home-made stock that just happens to have been pre-seasoned. Youd be adding a lot of salt and pepper anyway; just add less pepper."|`|AA10529146	Make a huger thing of chicken soup and leave out the pepper, then mix the two together.|`|PyjqMVqqaa	you want to even it out,so chicken soup is stock which stock is mostly made up of water. So add water until the soup is right for you. If u added veggies to your soup it's just about being able to even it out.|`|VoWoclF1aa	Try adding a bit more broth and a dash of sugar(or more).    I also suggest you pour a small bowl of it, and test each idea that way. Then you wont totally destroy your soup.|`|D0ks36f0aa	add more broth or water.  :D  i've had the same problem.
5zNwBQZHaa	I know there are some cookbooks out there that cover this time period - Most of the Central and Western states have cookbooks dedicated to the 'pioneer' days.      Are you trying to get a recipe from any particular area?  I just assumed you meant in the United States, so I could be wrong.    If you are looking for recipes from the US in the 1800's - check out this website from Texas: http://www.fortunecity.com/millennium/ba...    Of the recipes I can think of that were staples of that time period - in the American west - chili and cornbread comes first to mind.  Also beef  jerky and bean or pea soups.      Game was still common place - so just about any small game would do - like rabbit or squirrel.      Is this for a class?  I hope you find what you need.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Have you tried a web search?  A computer is great for looking for stuff like this.  It is to late for me to be looking up stuff but if you need an answer that would be the way to go.

f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	What a good idea! I too am looking to do something quite challenging for Lent this year, but since I'm already vegan, meat will not be my substance of abstinence. lol.     Okay. First I'd suggest that you pick up some vegetarian cookbooks from the library. They have tons of meal ideas and many of them have a vegetarian food pyramid. This will give you a good idea about how much of each food group to eat.     Next, brainstorm some of your favorite meals and then specifically look for vegetarian-version recipes. That will also help in your journey - comfort foods are always helpful.    As far as protein is concerned, just know that the Standard American Diet contains too much protein because of the amount of animals and animal by-products that are consumed. Our bodies don't need nearly as much protein as we do certain vitamins, minerals and of course fibre.   Some great sources of protein are: beans, nuts, seeds, tofu, quinoa and various whole grains.   Best of luck to you!|`|AA12334360	protien on a veggie diet is not a problem    may i suggest you read this short article as i think it will help you:  http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html    There is nothing i can add to that expert commentary from the veggie society.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	why in the heck do people worry so much about protein. Countless protein questions are starting to make me wanna bite someone's head off.     Fruits,veggies,beans,and whole grains should have everything you need. A multivitamin is wise too, but your already taking one so your set in that area.|`|AA12031316	Protein is not hard to get, although most people think it is.  The protein from plant based foods is actually more easily assimilated.  You can get adequate protein from beans, nuts, seeds, legumes, pulses, lentils, whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, oat groats, millet, flax, teff, spelt, etc)  Quinoa is a great source of complete protein. If you keep your diet well balanced, there should be no need for supplements at all.   Most vitamins pass through your system undigested and are a waste of money-you can get perfect nutrition just though eating a good mix of healthy (preferably organic) foods.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	There is just tonnes of products out there to substitute for meat! Soy protein in fact has more protein per kcal than beef does! So if you're worried about protein, here's just a few suggestions:      Soy milk, tofu, mock meats (mock bacon, burgers, sausages etc - found in the cold health food section of supermarkets and in some freezers)...  Nuts, lentils and beans.  Eggs and dairy  If you're only turning off meat for Lent, a decrease in protein won't be noticeable. But don't forget about Iron, zinc and B12 (most likely included in your multivitamin)...  Good luck! It'll be really rewarding, trust me...|`|5X8SvT38aa	You can eat eggs, dairy, beans, peas, seeds, and nuts. They will give you more then enough protein. Search vegetarian recopies on Google.
5zNwBQZHaa	Will you be making sauce for this or do you have some from the store.  If you are making your own sauce - Oregano is the most common spice found in pizza sauce, followed by Thyme - we use both.    I'm a big fan of spicy pizza - so a few drops of hot sauce goes a long way!    I like pineapple pizza - but I agree pineapple doesn't belong on every pizza.  But when I make it I put pizza sauce down and add pineapple and red pepper flakes - that is all that it takes to make me happy :)    Sun dried tomatoes are great on pizza, too - the kind in oil chopped up coarse.    I have never been a fan of salad veggies like broccoli and cauliflower on a pizza - it just doesn't seem like pizza to me - but go ahead and try them if you want.      Hope you end up with a great pizza!|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Make your own sauce (chop up some big italian tomatoes and simmer in a pan until soft, then add herbs like oregano, parsely, thyme or basil and a swirl of olive oil) and put that on the pizza base and top with the aforementioned vegies! I just think the homemade sauce goes a long way on a pizza!|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	Throw in some pepperonis. And olives. And chives.    GUILTY PLEASURES! DO IT DO IT!|`|M5HyStReaa	you don't have to have a tomato sauce base - they don't on Italy and often don't have cheese either.    Slice whatever topping you want (all or some of them that you have). Sprinkle with oregano and basil (fresh or dried) and plenty of black pepper.    drizzle copiously with olive oil and cook for standard pizza time

Just make sure you change your ice water when  it gets cloudy.|`|t0vuwuGXaa	The reason it's called a candy thermometer is because it can register and handle the high heats required for candy making.    Never use a medicinal thermometer for cooking!  It will break.    Look for a video on epicurious.com or youtube for fudgemaking.  It's easier to see what to look for then to describe it.|`|XFuw5Hcyaa	I think candy is very finicky and if you are going to be upset at possibly wasting the ingredients or you plan to make these in the future you should buy one... they can be found for $10-$15.     Otherwise, yes you can do one of the other methods but they usually require a more experienced candy maker to know what's right. My suggestion if you decide not to buy a thermometer is you look up some youtube videos on how to test and when it's "done".|`|XHnpraaxaa	Just do a soft ball test.  This question has been asked many times.|`|zawmsUO1aa	You can do the soft ball test, but it's an iffy proposition. Nothing is worse than buying the ingredients and spending all that time on candy or fudge, only to have it fail.    http://baking911.com/candy/fudge.htm    If you're feeling brave - go for it. The worst thing that could happen is that it doesn't set up and the end result is a gloppy syrup that has the consistency of sweetned sand.     Good luck with that.

SjDVMh3Uaa	I think it makes them feel important. I have noticed this also. I used to drink Bud then for years my favorite was Miller Genuine Draft and then I drank Busch simply because it tasted okay and was less expensive than Bud. I have drank the more Expensive Guinness Extra Stout for a couple of years and prefer the dark full flavored beer, but the other beers like Bud and coors are not crap, it is just a matter of taste     Now about the only beer I wills ay is crap is Milwaukee's Best. To me and this is just me that is an alcoholics beer.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	The megabrews are brewed with rice and maize, rather than all barley. This results in a thinner, cheaper, less tasty beer. If that's what you like, that's what you should drink.

Maybe not openly, but for a light pilsner, Budweiser is OK. Miller and similar are fair, Coors is... not particularly good. Opinions vary. Etc.    The problems, however, are legion. Most beer drinkers only know Bud or one of the awful "Light" varieties and think that it constitutes -b-e-e-r- as an entire product universe. It's like thinking McDonalds is the only way to make a hamburger. So it saturated the market and pushes out a lot of decent smaller beers. Then it flooded the market with the drek that passes off as "lite beer", which is why the rest of the world all but gave up on drinking American beer.    So yes, beer lovers look down on the industry that Bud has created, and they look down on the really watery light beer that Bud & kin shovel out and flood the airwaves with commercials for. And most Bud drinkers will never try a glass of something like Porter or Stout or Bock and they think such beer is "fruity" or unAmerican.    /rant.|`|D7BmQk0raa	I like Bud too.

Just because some person likes a particular beer more than the rest doesn't make it any better. Everyone has different taste buds too, so, everyone perceives taste differently. For example, most people like and even love cheesecake... I personally can't stand it. I think it tastes rotten and has a disgusting texture. But, just because I say plain old boxed chocolate cake is better than cheesecake doesn't mean it actually is.    Oh and by the way, I'm with you on the Bud thing. I prefer Bud Light in the can over any other beer out there.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	people say that because they don't use top-quality ingredients, and are made with "refreshment" in mind, rather than being a really flavorful beer.  they are made in massive quantities, in an industrial process that divorces the "brewer" from the end product.  this can mean the brewer is less invested in the outcome, leading to a lower-quality product|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	It's a matter of taste.  If you like Bud and Coors, they're fine.  People call everything "crap" that they don't like.  ( my father is great for that).  Drink what you like and ignore the comments.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Coors, Miller, Bud, etc., are inoffensive.  They appeal to most people.  They're relatively cheap.      Kinda like white zinfandel in wines.  It's not great but not terrible, so most people find it OK to drink.    I personally think Bud (and white zinfandel) are nauseatingly sweet.  Coors has a nasty aftertaste, Coors Light, might as well drink water ... Miller isn't terrible.    There are a lot of beers out there, and some of the mass-produced ones aren't bad.  I like Rolling Rock and Yuengling (though Yuengling is better as draft than bottle).      One of the best ones I've had is Dortmunder Gold (Great Lakes Brewery).|`|VYWaL2graa	If you want to taste what beer is without "all the extra flavor added" then you want to try something that follows the reinheitsgebot (german purity law). By law, they can only use barley, hops, water. American beers are horrible because so much rice & corn is used in them.|`|PU4RRduXaa	i personally like budweiser too . but i would choose a newcastle over anything .|`|grdjrg1Uaa	nahh bro those are good beer. keystone is crappy beer yet i love keystone haha. no you know what a crappy beer is. moosehead or something it tastes like skunk its nasty as ****.|`|zw9QlYXfaa	The brewers of the beers you speak of do in fact use cheap and inferior ingredients. They mass produce beers that are less flavorful than those produced by smaller breweries. That being said, the average American beer drinker prefers light lager beer which doesn't require the highest quality ingredients to produce. Also, don't be fooled into believing that "imported" means better. Foreign brewers mass produce their products too, and are much less strict about the way their products are stored and handled before they make it to the consumer. Mega brewers, both foreign and domestic, spend their money on advertising, not high quality ingredients.  I hate to hear beer snobs put down mega- beer drinkers, but I also hate it when a Bud or Miller drinker says that all micros and imports are "skunky". They are not. Be open minded and you may discover a whole new world of great beers you enjoy.
829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Depends when you ate them.   It's believed, that eating food( especially greasy and fatty foods) before going to sleep, can cause nightmares( because your tummy is working hard at digesting these foods while your sleeping).  There has been studies done which seem to support it and I know that if I fall asleep after a meal, I don't sleep well.  But, I don't think they've quite proved it to be a fact.  That's why they always say not to eat anything heavy 2 or 3 hours before going to sleep.|`|XHnpraaxaa	I never had any problem with them.  Never knew anyone food causes nightmares.|`|AA12031316	They give me nightmares just thinking about them.
