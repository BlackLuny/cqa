AA11452852	There aren't many cities without AT&T coverage, at least not cities worthy of the name.  One place that has no AT&T service is Juneau, Alaska.  There is also hardly any service in most of Nevada (outside of Las Vegas and Reno), and in the northern parts of Maine and New Hampshire.  They have a coverage map where you can see their service areas.   http://www.wireless.att.com/coverageview...    But if you are trying to come up with a story to tell them that will let you get out of the cancellation fee, forget it. They will ask you for your new address, and they will probably mail you a letter there.  If it is returned undeliverable, they will figure it out.  They are not stupid.      I guess this is not what you wanted to hear, but I hope it helps.  Good luck!!
zSjBHNSFaa	There are some great websites that allow you to trade books, CD's, DVD's etc. See my profile for link to titletrader, SwapaDVD and paperbackswap. This allows you to get rid of an item you no longer want and get something you do want in return. Titletrader is awesome because you can trade books, dvd's, cd's, games and vhs tapes. So if you get rid of a book you may be able to get a dvd in exchange. Paperbackswap is only for books. SwapaDVD is only for DVDs. All three sites are great!

I work for as a proofreader for an advertising/printing company in the Troy, Michigan area.  We employ many graphic artists, including one that teaches graphic design at Specs Howard, to create and design the ads for our customers and our office is generally pretty casual.  We're actually quite busy right now and splitting our staff into two shifts- I'll be working afternoons starting next week.  If you are interested, feel free to shoot me an e-mail and I'll talk to my boss on your behalf.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	Don't know anyone, sorry.    BUT...try the local tv stations (WDIV, PBS-detroit), they usually have intern positions available, or see if your school counselor can help get you into one of them.

I know the public tv channels (like your local community channel, or local high school tv channel) are pretty good about letting kids do this too...just get ahold of them.     good luck

Do not stop and back up, as it is unsafe. However, payment for the toll is still required.

AA11452852	Sorry, but no one here will do your assignment for you. However, I can tell you that Ida B. Wells-Barnett and Booker T. Washington had very different approaches.  You might even say they were the complete opposite of one another.     So read a least a little about these two African-American leaders, and I think their differences will be very clear.

utbfT0APaa	VIAGRA is prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).    Important safety information     Don't take VIAGRA if you take nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, as this may cause a sudden, unsafe drop in blood pressure.    Discuss your general health status with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough to engage in sexual activity. If you experience chest pain, nausea, or any other discomforts during sex, seek immediate medical help.    As with any ED tablet, in the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.    If you are older than age 65, or have serious liver or kidney problems, your doctor may start you at the lowest dose (25 mg) of VIAGRA. If you are taking protease inhibitors, such as for the treatment of HIV, your doctor may recommend a 25-mg dose and may limit you to a maximum single dose of 25 mg of VIAGRA in a 48-hour period.|`|nnBAnBOlaa	It helps impotent men achieve and maintain and erection.|`|5exiXAQbaa	Viagra is a tablet to get you a hard/fat to make your dick hard lol|`|SvzKyWGXaa	UM, LOL.

xhLfOcG2aa	It's really dependent on what you want to buy.    Personally, I wind up shopping at like, 2-3 different places to get our household's groceries:    --I go to a bread store outlet for bread and other snack goods; 4 loaves of bread for $3 is cheaper than any grocery store I know of.  --I have a membership to Sam's Club for bulk items like frozen chicken breast and ground beef.  --Safeway is conveniently-located where I live, so I usually pick up odds 'n' ends there - milk and oddball stuff that I need for meals.  --Fresh And Easy is an awesome place for fresh produce and meat, as well as fairly cheap high quality premade food.  --Places like Sunflower Market or Sprout's is great for cheap and super-fresh produce and fruit.|`|V675pNwiaa	Frys|`|E3tWPVEqaa	At Globe|`|T6nmD3X9aa	try the supermarket, they usually have food there|`|cwsYM2F4aa	I live in AZ.

Other than that, I'm happy with their food quality and they have a lot of things (in particular, Hispanic foods) that other stores don't carry.  I recommend it.|`|AvYycLOTaa	I think it depends on what youre looking for.     If you are looking for organic produce then head over to whole foods or sunflower, its great quality but you will have to pay the price.    if youre only cooking for one person fresh and easy has good deals, but not alot to choose from.    Personally, I shop at Frys, I think their food is fresher and of higher quality with a lower price tag than the farmers markets.

I just called someone that still works there.  They sent the W-2s to the stores this year.  They should have mailed them out by now, but I worked for company for a long time and I can tell you they are as a company rather lazy and unorganized so I would recommend calling the actual store you worked at and asking them if they still have it there or if they have mailed it.  If they have mailed it and you have still not received it you can call the benefit line at 1-800-Winn-Ben.|`|olMoJiYmaa	w2s were sent to stores,(unless you dont work there anymore, than im not sure) get the human resources number and find out exactly where yours is|`|koJ3bdYTaa	Because the deadline fell on a Saturday, the actual legal deadline was Monday Feb 02.    You can recreate your W2 with your last pay stub.  Get your paystub, and call the IRS at (800) 829-1040 for help in obtaining the missing form.  By alerting the IRS to the fact that you have no recourse, they will remind your boss that you need your W2.    If you file based on the information in your last paystub, and then you get your W2 (finally) and it's different, then you have to refile.  So it's worth waiting as long as you can for this to be resolved.    This process is outlined in the website referenced below.
AA10834046	They can't be messing with you on a W2.  Were you on the books the whole time?  Were you working as a contractor?  You say you earned over $20,000.

Call them and tell them it's wrong.  It you don't want to speak with them, you need to file your tax return with the correct wages.  I believe you can report the error to social security adminstration and they will contact the employer.

NzHtbpfJaa	Unless you want to do hard manual labour you won't get excellent pay at your age...    However, remember you do get paid more on weekends, public holidays etc.... My son worked at Coles - started at $7.70 (approx) the minimum wage for Qld, but working Sundays you can get over $10 an hour ....    You also get a staff discount card if you work for the Coles/Kmart group, which you mum can even use on her food shopping (that will make her happy) plus you get cheaper movie tickets through work etc...    All my sons mates applied online for jobs for Coles and Kmart and got called up for interviews and was working within a month, so don't let these online application forms put you off.    You can also try places like Subway, Mcdonalds, KFC, any fast food joints.    Supermarkets such as Woolworths, IGA, Bi-lo.     Department stores such as Target, K-Mart. Big W, Office works    Game shops, ebgames, Video/DVD rental stores ...    Hardware such as Bunnings, Mitre 10..
