My...ex... did that to me he told me he loved me and that he wanted to be with me forever then out of the blue he moved to LA now we're so far apart we're in different time zones...Maybe you should try calling/texting them and just ask (try not to be too direct) why they never told you...you never know maybe it was too hard for them to let you go.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	I would be hurt! Hope you get over it though like gump said Sh^t happens!|`|WiSlOcBraa	then that would ******* suck|`|I4xL5eooaa	The question is do you believe he was sincere? i assume this person lived there for a while and you knew each other, if that was the case, then there is a high possibility that he wasn't lying. Have you ever stopped to think about the fact that he might have been trying to tell you but just couldn't? Have you ever thought of the fact that he might have told you at that time knowing that he was leaving because he was afraid of how you might react?Did you even give him a reply?This should teach you that in life every moment counts, who knows, it might even be that perfect moment you will never forget.

XNaEyYqtaa	You might be shy and lonely  that's kindof how one of my best friends was before I met him and now we are both completley crazy together! I'm sure you are an amazing person and someone wants to be your friend! You just need to put yourself out there a little bit more. :)|`|YQJnO0RXaa	Well when you meet someone new, one thing you can do is smile when they look at you, it makes them feel a little bit more comfortable around you. You can always ask for like a pen or something, it can be anything small. Because when you do this, a lot of times the other person starts talking to you first, but if they do make sure you don't give them straight answers like "yes" or "no" because they may feel like you don't want to talk to them. Good luck!|`|S0w7ZNQKaa	Find someone you want to make friend of yours. Then try to help or support him/her at the time when it is required.

If he thinks she's a negative influence; well, there may be reasons.  I have a friend that is EXTREMELY negative...and it wasn't until recently that I realized how she has monopolized the relationships that I've had...and consequently always been there to help me after they've failed but I never realized how much she enjoyed watching them fail.   I don't think it's fair of your husband to give you an ultimatum...but I think it would be extremely selfish of you to not try to see his point...because if you guys get a divorce and you see his point of view later; there may be no going back.|`|CCCWGJCHaa	ultimatims are never good, however, you should take his comment into consideration. think about how you act when you are with your friend: what kinds of things do you say and do? are you really acting differently, or is he actually out of line? ask him to give you some examples, and really take a good hard look. sometimes people dont realize how bad a person is for them because they are too close to the situation. I'm in your boyfriends position with my boyfriend: his friend is a terrible influence on him. but instead of giving my lover an ultimatim (sp), I explained to him how i feel he acts when his friend is around, and said that while i wont tell him not to hang out with that friend, he knows that if his friend is there i will not be.|`|dbQHlp85aa	If people outside of any relationship are telling you that one single person or a group of people isn't good for you then you should probably do some serious re-evaluating of the situation. She really might not be a good friend to you but I would ask him to quantify that statement. when he says it, does he give examples?<br>  <br>  However, I don't think that there should be any ultimatums.. EVER.. that seems very controlling. <br>  <br>  But if he means a lot to you then you might  have to see it from his side.. is marriage with this man possible?<br>  <br>  I would tell him that you don't do ultimatums very well and you don't want to break up with him but you don't want him telling you what to do either. <br>  <br>  But I would talk to him and figure out what it is about this particular grind that he doesn't like. Does she like to take you out to the bar and get smashed? Does she do drugs? Does she use you? Is she bringing as much to the table as you are? If any of these are possible than you should re-evaluate your friendship with her.|`|8y2oHjlwaa	dont give up your friends for some stupid guy.<br>  if you two break up you will have no one to turn too.<br>  and you miss soooo much with your friends.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	friends > dating|`|wck4MHREaa	Roger Ebert, in his review of "Zack and Miri Make a Porno" (it'll make sense in a minute, trust me), wrote this line:<br>  <br>  "...a good friend is so much harder to come by than a (bleep)"<br>  <br>  I'll let you know right now, unless your friend is truly a bad person and you can see it yourself, you should probably stick with your buddy, since guys come and go, but it is truly so much harder to find a good friend in this world.|`|479460cc8a083eaa121c7c4f99e95066aa	Your bf sounds like he wants to control your life and that your gf is in the way of his ability to control you. Look at the actions that you do while with the friend. See if you think you do act stupid around her and if she is a bad influence on you but do not dump the gf before you evaluate yourself.|`|QhT9MjEoaa	Screw that! No guy should ever give you an ultimatium! Boyfriends come and go, you'll regret dumping your friend for him.  You need girlfriends in your life that you can act stupid with.  I'm sorry but you should dump your boyfriend, you'll come across one that will accept her.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	let him go. what will he ask you to give up next? you've only been w/him a year, there are many more men. friends are hard to come by, or at least good ones whom you can trust.|`|bqlvntzEaa	tell ur friend. see what she thinks. if u cant be with someone cuz ur friend that sucks. stop acting stupid when ur around her. tell her she should too|`|89owZt6Haa	sounds controlling.  bet he's controlling in other areas...if you really think it over.  not good.|`|JizwgEiYaa	chickz b4 dickz|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	tell him bye|`|I1I5ljLiaa	When men try to get friends out of your life, it is usually the first sign of an abusive relationship. I know what its like to have a man around who can be great around kids, but if he's making you choose than I think he should be the one to leave your life. There are bigger fish out there, and I know that one day you will find him when you least expect it. Also, do not try dating services. They typically don't work. Remember, don't give up if it's worth having than fight for it! Girl Power!|`|AA11054585	A boyfriend or girlfriend should never come between friends.  Having said that - you can tell a lot about your boyfriend or girlfriend from what their friends are like.  If you really do act like an idiot when your friend is around then maybe your boyfriend should take it as a sign that he should be thinking about dumping you!|`|xnULbpgqaa	if he's not willing to handle your friends, he isn't someone you need to be with.<br>  <br>  people always act stupid with the people they are closest to. if you and this guy furthered your relationship, you'd be silly around him, too. he needs to get over himself.

I have been a member for years...|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Leave it alone.   If they come to you, then fine, get involved, but otherwise let them work it out.   Your husband made the mistake by talking to his brother en law.   He should have talked to his sister.   You do not cross the line to the other family members unless asked.   As for his mother, I would share nothing with her that I would not want spread around.   She is not a friend and you all need to just be polite and say no more than needed towards her.   But if you and your husband feel that she needs to be talked too, then your husband should do the talking.   Only because she is from his family.   If the issues are with your family then you do the talking.   This helps keep the peace between the families.   Your husband crossed the line when he talked to his brother en law.   That is why there is tension.  Even though his intentions were good.   Good luck.|`|YFAPpzngaa	In most cases it is advisable to confront the problem head on.  In this case, both you and your husband should have a discussion with his mom and let her know that, although you both love her very much, you would appreciate if she would leave you guys out when it comes to interfamily gossip.<br>  At the same time, as long as you are both compatible with your husbands sisters family, then form and strengthen that relationship and respect that relationship within it's limits.<br>  If, in the future your mother-in-law starts up with her gossip, just remind her of your wishes.  Unless she has absolutely no respect for you or your boundaries, it shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 reminders before she knows not to discuss family gossip with you.  Be moderately patient with her, but firm in your convictions. Good luck!|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Next time she tries to run her mouth change the conversation, if she doesn't get the hint then hang the phone up. When she calls back and ask why then you have her attention- you tell her in no uncertain terms you and your husband are not interested in listening to all that quack talk! Marriages are hard work if your always worried about someone elses what do you think will happen to your own?|`|OnFdcvwbaa	Its time for a family meeting.Your sister n law should know how your mother n law is running around telling her business. And let her know that she is the route of all the problems with yall. And your sister n law an her husband need counseling.|`|dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	I think your family "talks" too much.  Next time your mother-in-law starts to tell you something about someone else, politely tell her you don't want to take part in gossiping.  Tell her if there is something you can do to help then you will do it, but if all she is going to do is talk about someone behind their back you don't want to be involved. <br>  <br>  You and your husband need to get your lives out of others peoples drama.  If you and your husband aren't part of the problem or aren't part of the answer to the problem don't listen or get involved.  <br>  <br>  As far as the current problem, stay out of it.  If someone wants to talk to your husband they can call him, not you.<br>  <br>  Have a great life with your husband and stay away from the drama.|`|KZDkJyjFaa	What can i say that you dont already know<br>  <br>  Tell her i dont want to hear about it<br>  <br>  Tell hubby dont get involved and repeat what is said<br>  <br>  and when the mother in law starts - just say<br>  <br>  "Well how about those Mets"<br>  <br>  (Family phrase used when it is time to change the subject matter)
Al70bH3Iaa	Chill girl! well parents are always going to say nasty things about you. Eseciallyw hen your asian and you are not getting married. But things are changing and they are overly eager ( although it is true that it;s hard to find a really good guy that you know well to get married to) So if you think on their side, your bf is a good catch because they dont need to look around and go through the worrisome ( is thas a word) procedure of proposals.<br>  <br>  What has your bf got in mind? Does he want to get married soon? whats his opinion, you should talk it out with him as well. Maybe then you can tell your parents well look here i'm definitely getting married but not right now because if i get pregnant i won;t be bale to study etc. etc. They might understand if you give in your opinion.<br>  <br>  Be glad they like your bf, he's probably a really nice guy to date you for three years. My parents are trying to get me married off to someone else all because they didnt like my bf who thye didnt even know!<br>  <br>  You need to show them that you are in control of your life and you know what your doing ( i hope you are ;) ) but yes careers are important in this day and age, but not all asians think like us. So get a steady ground and talk to them!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|cDTG6kg1aa	tell them that you are going to finish studying first whether they like it or not. stand firm!|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	stand up|`|leQFak3Oaa	First of all, if you live with them, I would try to move out asap. Then you can live your own life, talk to them if you want and worry about your studies. If you don't live with with them, you need to break free and stop letting them put you down.  Surround yourself with supportive people.  If they say rude things to you say "Im sorry you feel that  way" and the walk out...don't take it.  And obviously the guy you are with is not for you.  I think you will free liberated when you break up with him and break away from the parents.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Wow. They are pretty adament about you getting married, eh? First of all, I'm sorry. That's got to be frustrating beyond belief! And on top of it, all their pressure is probably making you NOT want to marry your boyfriend even more, right? it's fantastic that you are focusing on your school and getting a career first. Most parents would be thrilled that their daughter is doing that, seriously! Plus, when you do that sort of thing first, you are more financially ready to be married and have children, if you choose to do so. <br>  <br>  Maybe after school is over, the best thing for you to do is find a job out of the area, in a different state, even. Away from your parents. You need to focus on you, and what you want and what makes you happy. If you do what your parents want you to do, you are going to resent them for it forever, eventually. I'm guessing that you love your parents very much, and maybe moving away would be hard for you? I think it would be best for you.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	Move to another country.
AA12299134	Music is always a good one.  EVERYBODY on the planet likes music.  If you are out socialising, ask her what her plans are for the night.  If she is out with somebody else, make a comment about her companions (nicely) and break the ice that way.<br>  <br>  Girls love chatting about their own lives, so see if you can make a nice, genuine comment about something she has (phone, jewellery, handbag etc) and start a conversation that way.  Girls LOVE compliments, provided that you are being genuine when you give them.  <br>  <br>  Hobbies are also a good way.  They get to talk about themselves, and you come across as interested and interesting, and not a random lecher.  Jackpot!<br>  <br>  A couple of things about how you approach the girl.  Be confident, but also listen to her in an interested way - avoid talking about yourself all the time.  Ask her leading questions so that she gets to talk about herself.  Don't be rude or arroagnt, just have a bit of male confidence.  Try not to saturate her with conversation.  Chat to her for a while, and then move on to something else.  If you want, you can come back to her later, but the chances are that if you have made a good impression, she will come and start talking to you in good time.  <br>  <br>  Leave some stuff to her imagination.  Girls look at the bigger picture (whereas men look at breasts) so if you are interesting/interested enough to gee-up her imagination and her curiosity, she will come to you wanting to know more.     Good luck.|`|zNkqZbE8aa	ask her what type of music she likes. has she seen any bands live. <br>  ask her about films. <br>  talk to her like you would to anyone else.

Make sure you get her involved in the conversation- keep her attention. Um, here are some routines that can help out as well:<br>  <br>  Search basic palm reading on the internet; it'll give you a chance to (at least) seem mysterious and knowledgeable about a girl's fortune (and it's safe to say that a lot of girls like having their fortune told), and you can also establish physical contact (which if you play your cards right, you can escalate from there)<br>  <br>  Search: The Cube routine= this is another personality routine in which you are able to tell what kind of man she like, what her dreams and hopes are, etc.<br>  <br>  Play like you're not interested in her looks and semi-insult her; for example, if you do a palm reading type thing, take her hand, then let go and say something like "Ew, your palms are all clammy!" or "Wow, you have big hands, like a man!"- but make it playful so that she'll be embarrassed but not insulted.<br>  <br>  Oh and there's also the other type of flirting- touching, dropping hints in speech, etc. I can't really help with that though.|`|DwTTt628aa	hi just ask her what music, films etc does she like and ask her about her family and tell her about yours then when the ice is broke tell her you like her eyes, smile that worked for me i now have been with my boyfriend for 3 years i am engaged and have two kids (hope that hasnt put you off ha ha )|`|a59ef2d6e344a5e9aa6f055a0dfa92f1aa	their family..like how many brothers and sisters they have, their favorite movies, favorite music, where they grew up, what they do for a living, what type of guy she usually dates..<br>  <br>  idk hope this helps : )|`|VJRqSueSaa	Music, Fashion,holidays.Ask lots of questions you think the girls like to talk about .

Even if he isn't meaning to, this guy is completely manipulating you and treating you like a yo-yo. If he cared more about you he would be honest and straight with you and let you go until he could get himself together. He cares about himself more than you or his girlfriend because he is putting himself and his feelings before either one of you.<br>  <br>  Don't put up with this garbage and let yourself be hurt/ treated this way. Do you really want a guy this spineless, fickle, and who keeps on playing games with your feelings? Don't you really deserve better than that? As long as you put up with this, he will continue to do this over and over again. He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. This is one of those cases where "if you love something set it free". Let him go and tell him you can't have anything to do with him until he can make up his mind. This will force him to grow up and stop playing with you. If he doesn't come back, he clearly isn't worth it. If he does, he will appreciate you and respect you more. This is the only way to truly get what you want. It all comes down to two questions: why do you care more about this guy than yourself and why are you allowing yourself to be treated in a way that clearly makes you feel miserable?|`|msgHpgteaa	If you want the honest answer then brace your self for it. I have friends that have been in the same predicament, and have seen only one viable solution.<br>  <br>  Stop all contact with him. The poor baby is confused, right? He doesnt want to leave his girlfriend or alternatively he doesnt want to commit to you. If he liked you more than his girlfriend and risked losing you - he would have left her/lost contact with her by now.  Or, he doesnt think that he risks losing you. Why? because sweetheart your always there for him when he needs you. I know its hard (trust me i went through the same ****) but until you act like your moving on - he'll realise that you'll get snapped up straight away and he'll have to decide one way or another.<br>  <br>  Do you not think your better than this? Than being compared and shouted at by his 'other' woman? All things happen for a reason - and by him going back to his girl he showed you that he's not the right one for you. Imagine you could be in a relationship where you were the only woman, and uncomparable. What this guy is doing is mean - he wants the attention you give him, and whatever his girlfriend is giving him. I know you like the guy, but i really do not think his intentions are good.|`|8561fe0c5f5e506d723b08ec7c42e4e1aa	wow it seems like you have it hard, but girl it seems like he's playing with you a little, you need to tell him that he can't have two girls in his life unless it's his mom, or sis and if you don't wanna go down that road you can simple play back, pretend to be talking to a next guy and trust me there is nothing that a guy hate more than ----is to know that there is another guy looking his girl, and you can't hid your feelings or you'll be stuck where you are now....|`|JWp9PMyRaa	Yeah, I think you should let him go....He cant have the best of both worlds...Hes into someone else...for your emotional concern, Id say move on..<br>  <br>  Seems like hes torn between the both of you..and if hes not mature to resolve the situation..and its obvious hes not man enough for you...<br>  <br>  Just let him go..<br>  <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER MINE|`|n5fZo5njaa	seems to me like he's torn in two. he wants both of you.<br>  So you have to make him choose, if he chooses you then lucky you, if not then go find another guy.

Selfish:  go back just a few years with a list of winning lottery numbers.<br>  <br>  Twin Towers, a few minutes before impact:  activate the nearest fire-alarm of the building that I was in and then call in a bomb threat to the other building.<br>  <br>  Obviously there are a great many things about my life that I wish had gone differently.  Some are genetic to include ADD, asthma and allergies; obviously no control over those.  Some are environmental to include an absent father, an alcoholic mother and several especially *viscous* bullies in junior high & high school; not much control over any of that either.  Some are bad choices that I made to include choices that I made acting on incorrect or incomplete information.<br>  <br>  There are a "ka-zillion" historical things that I wish that I could change most of which boils down to man's inhumanity to his fellow man.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	I would change the election results from November.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	selfishly?

Sure the guys will have sex with you but nobodys gonna take you home to Mom. Somebody should take you to the clinic though.|`|wk52iEDTaa	um, thats a freaking victoria's secret model..idiot|`|crHL63Ftaa	oaky looky here trick ur not hot u look like a fat granny in a spedo and sagging **** so try that on for size u two ton pounded *****|`|n5fZo5njaa	its an edited picture. so im sure that's not you.<br>  Only graphic artists like me can do editing like that, i could probably do better though haha.<br>  <br>  lol u must be a 12 year old kid
2uoRjf32aa	it seems like he is in love with his current girlfriend who definitely feels threatened by u or simply doesn't like u and hes getting a lot of pressure from her. the best advice i can give is that your guy-friend is a coward he shouldn't change his behavior towards you because of whom is dating he should be able to tell his girlfriend that you are his friend and he will keep talking to you but since he seems to be ignoring you ignore him back move on with your life don't waste time sms him since u already know he doesn't want to talk to u..u can find other better friends out There but don't be surprised when comes running back to you once his current relationship has ended.i know that it hurts a lot to lose a friend that you like a lot but be strong the pain will pass away<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|JDltTREfaa	Why didn't he reply?  Because you were rude and he doesn't want to fight or argue with you.  His actions made it clear that he was choosing his girlfriend over you.  <br>  <br>  I understand that he wasn't a good friend to you.  (Guys tend to think with a very specific part of their bodies - so his actions are understandable.)  But you weren't a very good friend to him, wouldn't you agree?  If you had been a real friend, you would have sent him a message that you understood that maybe his girlfriend wasn't comfortable with you.  You could have said something like "I don't want to cause any waves in your relationship because I'm your friend and wish you the best" without including the stuff about deleting his contact information!<br>  <br>  Do you really think this relationship with the girlfriend is going to last?  Of course not.  Frankly, if you had been kind and understanding (and left your friendship open to him) you would have shown him that not all girls are emotional, irrational, jealous lunatics and that might have encouraged him to bail out of that relationship sooner. If you hadn't gotten your feelings hurt and attacked him, he almost certainly would have come slinking back with an apology for treating you like dirt.  You'll probably still get the apology . . . but it'll take longer and you might not be as close.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Who gives a sh*t why he didn't reply? He obviously is so whipped by his girl that he can't maintain a healthy FRIENDSHIP with another female because of HER insecurities. Let him be. It's HIS loss. When that girlfriend of his loses him all his friends, then he'll be wishing he'd kept you as a friend. When he grows some balls, then you should worry about why he didn't respond, but it doesn't seem likely that he will any time soon, so just move on and count it as a loss. There are more males that will be glad to be your friend without letting their childish jealous girlfriends ruin it.  Good luck.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Jealous girlfriend has him you know what whooped maybe???? Sorry for teh loss of your friend.|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	what|`|gbOGWFkbaa	this is a sad truth and hard to hear but that guy loves his girlfriend more that anyone else in his life and coz she has some grudge against you or maybe u ca call that jealousy against you & she must have told him this so to keep her happy he is ignoring you..on the other hand you are really a very good friend that you have clarified the things and have left them alone to lead their life...when the guy actually realizes that he misses u're presence in his life then he will come to you & if he doesn't come back u may say that he never in life cared about you ...harsh but true fact|`|iSayo0kwaa	If this guy is a friend, a true friend, a friend that cares about your feelings he would not do that to you. He should come right out and tell you what you did wrong or why he needs to avoid you.<br>  He probably doesn't want to fight with his girlfriend and she is obviously the one in control of their relationship. <br>  Just be cool and act like you don't mind that he doesn't talk to you. <br>  Be happy and smile etc..<br>  He will come around again. If he doesn't then so what? Find a better friend. One who cares about you !
kGBli717aa	Don't bother telling him that you don't like her, just tell him about how she beats you. If he doesn't act on that information; he is a wimp and a bad father as he is choosing her over you. <br>  If it's bad, call Child Protective Services, they will intervene and they almost always take the kid's word over the parent, especially a step parent as this is a common problem. <br>  See if you can live with you mother or a relative, as CPS may decide to place you in a different home; they have a lot of power in these situations..<br>  Good luck and I hope your father does the right thing and throws her out.
cDTG6kg1aa	I think that you should get him on his own without her and show him the bruises and be very sincere and if he ignores him tell him you call the police then do if he continues to do nothing. If you cannot get him on his own then you could phone him. while he is at work.
oopg697aaa	Just say bye bye to him and walk if he still wants you he will come back.....we humans are like house flies the more you try to catch them the further they run but if you leave them alone they will come and sit on your nose....think about what i said...:) <br>  <br>  Oh he wants sex too but no point giving it to him if he is going to be a jerk anyways...:)|`|v96pYAg1aa	He is saying he doesn't deserve u tell him different and give him a huge hug and kiss|`|08y217Rdaa	It all sounds like a lack of trust on his side. He just can't get certain things through his thick skull. He does think that you dig out someone else while he is away, that's why you got those calls and pics back then.Insecurities and low self-esteem spawn many kinds of thoughts, there are no room for feelings then. Just like you wrote here: he does not believe all the things you tell him. Go figure.
AdoY6wKZaa	Those nasty things he said to his friends should have told you that it's over with and finished. You might have screwed up in the relationship, but he shouldn't talk about you to his buddies. He's a miserable guy and you should now leave him alone and not communicate with him anymore. He'll keep hurting you.|`|Ez9NB86Iaa	You are in the wrong|`|xZI6noJiaa	You guys have a history together, so he'll always feel something. But obviously how you handled the relationship must have been really bad, because it sounds like he's not even willing to give you a chance to show you could be different. Stop waiting around for him because it sounds like you screwed up bad enough he's never gonna trust you.|`|XtZxAyZSaa	he only likes your feelings|`|0ii4V9bEaa	if you love him, fight for him|`|gLek6XTuaa	means that he still hasnt let go and heas hanging onto the past. have a word with him tell him you want the truth and to stop messing about.<br>  <br>  you obviously still have feelings too for him so tell him that. tell him you miss the old times and your now willing to carry on with the relationshop and will take it seriously. tell him you have grown up. <br>  <br>  you need to ask yourself do you want this? if not then stop kissing him and let him and yourself both move on. you also need to ask yourself if your ready and if your not going to flirt with other guys.<br>  <br>  all the best i hope it works out <br>  <br>  <br>  xxx|`|e5fAauX0aa	ok, well like he said, he will always feel something....but the fact that the first try on the relationship didnt work out for whatever you did, he might be hesitant to get back with you and try to avoid getting hurt.<br>  <br>  but if you really like him, fight for him and prove to him you have changed or will change. [:|`|LIjCihQ7aa	he hasn't moved on completly but he wants to. you need to let him know that your sorry for the pain you've caused him and that your willing to change. let him know that your not gonna be waiting for him to forgive you. its now or never.|`|i8hfnvq6aa	he misses you but then he remembers wat you did and he must of felt very deeply for you cuz he probly still hurting every time you bring it up i say just go wit the flow you never no wat might be coming around the corner keep your head up....|`|GsRpZJX5aa	loook you messed up the relationship <br>  thats ur fault he shouldnt treat you like crap but it<br>  sounds like he still has resentment towards you.<br>  so move on|`|hjS7HA7daa	i'm sorry i don't know :S|`|AA0MuMt3aa	I think it means that he was too hurt in your relationship now, and he's moved on from it, but he'll always feel something in the way that he's learnt from it, and it's affected because he might find it more difficult to be in a serious relationship now.<br>  I think you should move on from it, and don't wait. He means that he doesn't want to be with you because it hurt him, and he'll feel the pain but also the experience and he'll move on from it.<br>  Don't be sad and don't wait. Just keep going with life.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
gRXy66dOaa	1st of all, fix your grammer<br>  <br>  I dont think it means that she likes you<br>  <br>  I have girls everyday that tells me that " good-bye love" its just a friendly good'bye|`|vj2ScX6Paa	maybe she likes him and is hoping to get you to tell him but doesn't know how to ask you to do it...and don't want to hurt your feelings

Jn7bt3JTaa	I think your mother has issues that have nothing to do with you. She seems to be attempting to alleviate any guilt feelings by telling you. She probably realized she said too much already and that is whey she won;t tell you anymore.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself this question: Is knowing the "Truth" about my mothers past going to enrich my future in any way? <br>  <br>  She probably was having a weak moment when she told you that and I would be surprised if she already regret saying as much as she did.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Most women give their babies up for adoption because, they were raped,the dad isn't around,their too young,have no money..i think it's something you need to know, i know you have alot of unanswered questions.My advice would be to take her back out to eat and talk to her and get the closure that you need.Hopefully she'll open up.Good luck.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Maybe she has been feeling guilty about the way she has always treated you and thought that would give you some sort of explanation.  If she gave you that much information she should have gone ahead and answered all your questions for you as well.  That is very selfish of her to pick and choose what information you get to have now that it is out in the open.  She really should have never told you any of it at all.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	She really shouldn't have told you that, especially since she is now not talking anymore about it. It's a little psycho and weird. Not sure why she was going to give you up. She was in her 30s when she had you....not like she was a teenager or anything. She needs counseling, not you. So, it's not you, it's her.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	yeah, that's screwed up. She waited this long only to tell you part of the story?   I'd start writing down some questions.  Maybe she's not sure who your dad is.  Weirder things have happened.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	wow that's weird i am sorry|`|pdbc4souaa	Walk away from it. She didn't give you away. She's trying to make amends. At some point in the future she may have enough serenity to fill in the details. Be grateful for what you have.<br>  <br>  She raised you in such a manner that you failed to learn to write an English sentence or use a shift key. That offends me as a reader and someone you are asking for help, because it indicates that you are not respecting us.|`|e9vcseLlaa	Maybe because kids are so sensetive now maybe she didnt feel like she should when you were an adult. Im really really sorry. YOur mom is 50 and still might be going through the menapores. Which they sorta get confused about at that stage.  She does love you. SO much. Else she would of put you into care or something if she didnt want you. But she does and she loves you. I'd ask her and maybe make her see a shrink. Im really sorry tho xx|`|sNvF6KPbaa	she didnt like your dad, and didnt want you around as a reminder.  but then when you were around she had that memory of him and detatched herself.  assuming you had a dif dad then the other kids in your family.

Good Luck!|`|z2EVwBokaa	I think that if she told you that is because she wanted you to know. So...the good thing out of this was her honesty. As for the rest, there may be a lot of reasons why she couldn't handle another baby, but we all make mistakes, and the nature of the choice wasn't easy so, I'd put myself in her shoes and try to understand why she did what she did.|`|j8i4kSEDaa	My mother told me about a year ago that the only reason she's married to my jerk of a father was because she got pregnant with me and was forced to marry him, she blames me. <br>  <br>  I figure it's a form of release, for the guilt, that she feels. thats certainly something she shouldn't have told you now, but I suppose you're old enough to handle it. She probably just wants to get it off her chest.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	That's rough.  You are the youngest.  Maybe she wasn't ready for another child financially or mentally at the time.  She looked at it as a burden? Hey, look on the bright side...your mom has loved you for 21 years.  She felt you are old enough and mature enough to share that with you.  Don't take it to heart.  It hurts no doubt.  She trusts you with something that was very hard decision for her.|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	is it possible your relationship with your mom wasnt always so good. she may be getting this off her chest. i wouldnt worry about it. dont bring it up to often. but do tell her you need to talk to her about it.<br>  good luck :D|`|t8swfyD4aa	some people just want to control everything and the way they control people around them is to hurt them.

bXF1gDTcaa	disassociate yourself from her. it's not worth your time to argue and bicker, but i wouldn't take it out of her child. he/she is still part of the family too and won't necessarily end up like the rude, gold digging mother. don't worry, she'll get hers. just be the bigger person. what matters is having the family that does love you and that you care about.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Don't buy into her drama.

How is he showing any kind of responsibility or setting an example by doing the things he is doing?  You need to try and catch him at a time when he is sober if that's at all possible and explain to him that you have decided to move back to your moms cuz he is not being a father to you and has let his addictions take over his life.  Don't be concerned with what he thinks if he is any kind of father he will take this as a wake up call and get some help for his problems if not then it's not your problem to worry about. Go to your moms where you will be safe and have a parent there who puts your needs first.

Let him know that you do not think any less of him but that he must stop and get some help before you do.Let him know that he can talk/communicate to you, and that he is your father and you love him very, very much,no matter what.But he must stop because he is hurting himself and hurting you to see this.<br>  <br>    As far as hurting his feelings are concerned I would let him know his behavior and neglect have hurt your feelings.I know you worry about him,but he should also worry about you and your well being.Lastly, if he does not change if you can go back home with your mother that just might be what you will have to do.
S4QBvAaGaa	If it's not the cat meowing(60% of the time-she just don't care bout' nobody!), then the urge sets in to use the bathroom shortly after I wake. I honestly never wake up with goals in mind, those set in after about 15 min.<br>  Also, to me, it's not as if there was a reason to live, there's living and there's non-living and since I'm stuck here until death, I might as well do something with my life. I choose to pursue my positive interests and the happiness of others and that occupies whatever block of reason or purpose that was ever(or never) missing and compliments my time nicely.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|mrysAOpGaa	my kids.  My kids make my life worth living, they make me want to pursue my goals and dreams, and when im feeling down and defeated, all i have to do is see their smile or watch them play and it gives me that push.|`|r3O9XCSBaa	Im worried about your questions. Are you asking for your own help or are you just genually curious?|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	Night mares that is what wakes me up ruins my whole day
37M3dkkRaa	when the hell did people start giving things different names? just do what stimulates your girlfriend, try different things and just go with it...don't worry about "the swirly thing"
GVfHXICWaa	Stop talking to him. Let him chase you otherwise he's going to think your annoying and desperate. You seem like your very interested but let him return the interest|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Don't message him anymore unless he does first.|`|nv7Cofm5aa	You aren't stalking him at all. You're showing a big interest in who he is and feel compelled to get to know him more. Perfectly normal. Your actions are saying, "HEY! I'm over here and I would really really like to get to know you!" <br>  <br>  Before you 'assume' anything,even if you felt he was standoffish.... perhaps you should 'stop worrying' about what he thinks. You are too focused on how you 'present' yourself and that is perfectly normal. We all do that because we want to put on a good impression. But what is the point of putting on a good impression if he isn't putting one for you? That tells you something about people but it doesn't mean they 'don't like you'. You just don't know unless you ask. So ASSUME NOTHING. EXPECT NOTHING. And try NOT to get carried away or TOO INFATUATED. <br>  <br>  You're own worst enemy is you... so it's all about controlling yourself. Not an easy thing to do because we are human and feel the need to 'enjoy' certain people. We want to be desired, accepted, and admired for who we are. <br>  <br>  Remember this, 'his actions' tell you more about himself. So focus on his actions and how he responds to you. It'll tell you a lot about this person. Perhaps he might be interested in someone else. He might be focused on school. Who knows. Just ask.|`|e5fAauX0aa	well it depends on how you asked him where he lived and if it sounded ike a stalker, but if you dont wanna come off as a stalker...just maybe give a day or 2 of space between the both of you. so he doesnt think you are a stalker [:|`|4VIjILk1aa	You probably need to back off alittle. It doesn't sound like your stalking him but give him his space. Wait for him to talk to you. It might of freaked him out so wait for him to say something.|`|giDhTBoAaa	Well that's not stalking at all, as long as he doesn't try to avoid you.
szVvf7Nkaa	You can take him to court. Tell him if you don't have your stuff in a week that you plan to take him to court. In the meantime go to the police and ask them if you can make a report on this. Or if you have guts to go to his place but have someone with you like your dad, an uncle or a brother. But don’t let this ride for too long.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Do you have any friends living in his town? May be they can stop by his place and collect your stuff and mail it to you. If not then you have only two ways, either depend on him to send it to you or make a trip up North.|`|dbQHlp85aa	get a couple of your best gal pals and plan a road trip up there with a lot of empty duffle bags and go get your stuff.|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	did you GOOGLE and see if you can find his new address  and phone?  wheres he work? can you call his parents or sister? sounds like he just threw it in the dumpster so if you want you can send a letter   PO might FWD it and say i'm filing a  small claims  against you , maybe Judge judy will make it LIVE , so mail me my stuff or i will persue this?   my lawyer will take on this case?  <br>  love you too? <br>  <br>   hope something helps?|`|L0Hz227xaa	Well there is 2 options. This is a suck situation. First you can either forget the stuff and move on becasue there from the pass and he may have gotton rid of them, or you can file a police report to have him give them back, or allow you to go get them. Honestly i wouldnt waste my time, its not worth it. It wasting more of your time than his.|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	Go get your stuff.  Even if you have to stop by the police station and take a few of them with you to his house.  You are entitled to have your things.|`|n2P9vD1eaa	Contact the police. I believe (not having done research, but knowing the law fairly well) that that could constitute as stolen property. They can find him, get in contact with him, and get you your stuff back. If you have proof of them belonging to you, it would be good to get that out, and have ready to present to the officers.|`|CGlDAvkAaa	Go back up there when you know he's going to be there and pick your stuff up. If it's things you really don't need, then leave them and move on. He obviously isn't making any effort to get them to you.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Chances are that your stuff has been tossed out or burned by now, Dont make the trip unless you know for sure that he still has it.|`|0CKwjdKSaa	I recommend you to move on, cos he is not gonna mail them to you if he already has not.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Buy new stuff. Posession is 9/10ths of the law. If he's had it this long, nothing you can really do.|`|EYt8H5N2aa	I will call the police or take it upon myself to go up there and beat his tail. Im sorry but I would be heated!|`|YrBnLhDZaa	DAMN..that hard but you should report him to the police so that you could retrieve your things|`|FgRiw5CLaa	well it dosent sound like hes a nice person but you could look him up on people finder.com and see his new phone number|`|hxEylk59aa	well if you want your stuff back then go get them back...<br>  <br>  but if i were you i would just FORGET the past, leave it there with him or just burn them...<br>  <br>  just forget the past...<br>  <br>  but if you want to get them back then go talk to someone...talk to his friends, or family, or the police or even his mom....
vYeS5mYnaa	probably not... but i might get the procedure for myself :)...<br>  my son is intact. and my boyfriend. i think its more common in our culture now.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	what a stupid question.  as if boys dont get hair down there too!<br>  <br>  what would be great is if they give male infants something that prevents them from going bald, losing their ability to have an erection and preventing them from being jerks and asking stupid idiotic questions.  :)  <br>  <br>  now wouldnt that be appealing?|`|0udjgaoBaa	Yep! If they find something I want it too..|`|mMBzpldbaa	actually i think i would. and i would also get a baby boy circumcised. no question about it. i wish my parents could have prevented me from growing pubic hair, would stop me spending all of five minutes every day shaving it bald :)<br>  <br>  haha, pubes are for the old and the ape fetishists.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	What a retarded question. <br>  Pubic hair is there for a reason.|`|p3ptELZ2aa	No, it should be their choice.|`|lCyHJDeAaa	I absolutely would never choose this, nor do I support male circumcision. It's unfortunate that our society believes that painful procedures are necessary to look good. Pubic hair is a part of our body, so is a man's foreskin. We shouldn't have to change it according to ridiculous standards.|`|cDTG6kg1aa	no i would not have it done. it is her choice and being super hygeinic will not make her happier.
n2P9vD1eaa	It sounds to me like your not going to be able to. So you have a choice to make and a couple of options to choose from.<br>  <br>  1. Stay the course, fall in love, and watch as he finds other women.<br>  2. Stay the course, fall in love, and try to show him that you're the girl for him, that he shouldn't live without you.<br>  3. Tell him that you can't do what he's asking. Tell him that if you can't be together like that, then you need time apart, to keep yourself from getting hurt. If he can't understand that, he doesn't deserve you in any way.<br>  <br>  My personal recommendation is number three. It will be better for you, and there's always the chance that it will make him realize that he wants you in his life more than he realized. It sounds like he thinks he's got you no matter what, and if you show him thats not true, its possible he'll take you a bit more seriously. Good luck!|`|dbQHlp85aa	STOP SLEEPING WITH HIM?!? ARE YOU STUPID?!?<br>  <br>  You're giving him everything he needs with out the commitment.. why would he be with you when you give him every thing he wants without the work. <br>  <br>  He's treating  you like his doormat.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	The only way you can stop from falling in love with this guy is to stay away from him. His message was clear that you should not get attached to  him. And if you continue to see him then you are going to get hurt.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Stay away for awhile and get things straightened out or u stop doing what ur doing with him otherwise u will get close to him alot more close and it will hurt in the end or the other alternative u just ask him out and say u love him to it sounds like u love him too so I would confess before its too late otherwise it will hurt more|`|OM9mp4Hjaa	just try by telin him how u feel about the relationship yu and him have and dat yall bein bff should go 2 da next level not sayin yall should get marred but just expressin how u feel and if yu cant tell him den write it down or text him or email him just let him kno soon|`|Cadyoy2Vaa	i agree. it will be hard to get out of the friend zone|`|rz4sjxWBaa	sounds like he wants to have his cake n eat it too<br>  <br>  he loves that he has someone stable in his life that he can come to n know that he can always get the love n attention he wants but he also loves that he can explore other options<br>  <br>   n by going along with it by acting like his gf n falling for the whole "oh well we can act like lovers but dont get attached" BS ur letting him have the upperhand n get the best of both worlds-not kool<br>  <br>  dont try to fool yourself of course ur going to get attached n b jealous when hes around other girls thats normal n completely understandable i mean who wouldnt i know i would<br>  <br>  but if hes really ur best friend like u say u need to sit him down n tell him how ur feeling n that u want a commitment(cuz that is what u want right?) n if he doesnt agree than stop acting like ur his gf<br>  <br>   im not saying that its easy cuz i know from experience its not but y is he gunna buy the cow when he can get the milk for free(im not calling u fat by the cow thing its a metaphor ok lol ;D)<br>  <br>  hopefully if u do that he c what he lost n miss u n make some sort of commitment to restore ur relationship to what it once was<br>  <br>  or u could beat him at his own game n make him jealous back which would b fun n make u feel more in control n hopefully even that will make him want to commit for fear another guy will get u before he does|`|2DlC4lTAaa	well i know how you feel because i use to be just like that and i was in a situation just like that but the thing is we had gone out and then we broke up and now we just friend but if i was yuo just stay his friend and just tell him how you really feel|`|z2EVwBokaa	It's really hard to do that, because you have no control of what you feel... You're hurting yourself by thinking it and him telling you not to.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	stop spending every night with him. treat him like a best friend and nothing more. bear in mind when u are around him that he doesn't think of u as girlfriend material.|`|DabYmHt7aa	you cant choose who you fall for and dont it happens just tell him how you feel that with help|`|AA10495187	see him less, hang out with other guys.|`|mtiWHg5aaa	maybe if you make him jealous... then he would want you to be his girlfriend.|`|ulUBv22eaa	who knows u got cuaght in the freind zone so ur screwed|`|hZWspEJ4aa	he is a playboy keep distance.these are there ways to attract girls being sweet and caring and use the girls thats why he is using you as well as other girls|`|N6tTbsa4aa	Hang out with other guys and see if it makes him jealous if it does then maybe he does have feeling for you|`|tZY7sty2aa	My humble suggestion is that you should probably just tell this  guy that you like him. I know he told you not to get attached, but he will continue to hurt you and make you feel jealous until you fix the problem. I can't say would be able to NOT fall in love with someone. It looks like you are in love with this guy and the only option is to tell him and get it out of the way. If he likes you too, then it will probably work out. If not, then you should probably get out of the friendship because you two want different things. It wouldn't be good if you wanted to date and he didn't. <br>  <br>  Just tell him. :)

4NcshCDvaa	And how old is he?<br>  That will help me answer this.<br>  <br>  You havent been talking all that long. I know it probably seems like forever...but....<br>  If you guys argue all the time just over the computer..how much worse is it going to be in person? Or even on the phone?<br>  <br>  Do you want to meet him or not?<br>  I would suggest talking to your mother about it. I know it probably seems hard...but if you dont talk toher and you really want to talk to him or meet him..your mom is going to have to know sometime. <br>  <br>  How far away do you live?<br>  <br>  I would talk to a family member...your mom or someone else in your family you are close with...and try to set up a meeting in a public spot or a park or something. If they meet him too they willl feel more conifdent and will feel less awkward about you meeting him online. <br>  <br>  If you really think you love him or like him...That is what you should do. <br>  <br>  I would talk to him on the phone for a while first though.
MvisyrRVaa	DO NOT disown him or do anything Extreme. I myself am gay, and I lived in a Christian household as well. I constantly feared if I let my parents or friends know then my life would end. If you Truly want to know about this issue, then calmly discuss it. He may get over excited and defensive about the conversation BUT YOU MUST KEEP YOUR COOL! it is a very embarrassing question to be asked if you were taught that, that type of life style is bad. If you do find out he is gay then take time to learn about homosexuality and everything that goes with it. You will be surprised that there is more to homosexuality then just 2 guys being together. Also do not push religion into this either, if you push religion on it, your going to push your son away from you. I wish you luck in your findings.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I would ask him about it but don't be condescending. Just let hem know your aware of it. He's going to freak because you invaded his privacy though.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	He's curious, it's natural. I know you don't approve of it, but if it's really bothering you try and ask him about his feelings, tell him not to worry, but you would like to disscuss something, you're not going to judge him but as his mother you would just like to know. Don't criticise him or make him feel ashamed or embarassed when you talk about his feelings. But if you don't wanna talk about it, just be patient, wait a few long months and check if the gay porn is there in the history, even though you shouldn't have really been checking his history in the first place.|`|t8swfyD4aa	Did you ask your son why it was on there? Its been my experience that there's only one reason that young boys look at gay porn. I think you should ask him and what ever you do, remind your son that you love him. theres a movie i wish you could see its called prayers for bobby.  I grew up with a gay uncle who was in the closet to everyone but me and a few of my cousins. We grew up in a "christian" home also. of course there were no computers back then, but i remember he hid porn mags and stuff like that. His mother didnt know untill he was well into his 20's because of the fact that she had said that all gay people were going to hell and things like that.  My uncle almost killed himself because of the way my family treated him. Let me tell you something, it is hard having someone gay in your family. Espically if you see them rejected and in pain. My uncle is the nicest person you will ever meet in your life. He has the broadest understanding and the most excepting mind set of our whole family. I thank God everyday that his suicide attempt was not successuful. The world is a better place for having him in it.  Ask your son could be the gay porn was sent to him as a joke, or by accident.  I wish you good luck and God bless.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Sounds like he is curious.And he is most likely gay or bi.Just keep loving him.Don't bring it up.Because it might bring up trust issues.I mean, you must have trusted him in the first place, to have his own computer.<br>  I know you don't like it or tolerate it,but still love him.And try and install your values in him.So if he does venture off away from what he was brought up with,he can always come back to the faith.|`|0udjgaoBaa	It doesnt matter what religion you are if hes gay hes gay. Maybe hes curious. How old is he? All you can really do is make sure that he protects himself and be an open ear for him...He may be so confused and scared right now and have no one to talk to.Be his friend for a little while.|`|mrysAOpGaa	he's going to be mad that you looked through his computer because that's kind of over-stepping his privacy rights.  But, i would let him know that you are aware of what he was looking at and tell him you are concerned.  You need to respect his needs, he may be confused and i know it goes against your religion, but it may be what makes him happy.  Dont let him know you are dissapointed in him, dont disown him, but express how you feel, ask him what he is feeling, talk to him about it because he may need all of the support and guidance he can get rather than being judged.|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	ok. 1st you should accsept him not matter if he is gay bi or what. acsept him tho i understand it is aginst the bible. but it may be possible that he is at the age to where he is curious.<br>  i would band that on his computer. he will come to you asking and act as if you dont understand.. if you want to be secretive.<br>  i think you should suppport him tho.<br>  ask god what he would do. this may be planned or something.<br>  wait it out and if it gets to the point where you cant stand it email me<br>  <br>  scooter311425@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  ill reply.|`|Ux8ei5i5aa	Im assuming you are the mother? I would have a trusted adult man talk to him. Maybe his father or an uncle. It very well may be just curiosity.I dont think it means he is gay. Just try to get to the bottom of it before you freak out. He is not going to be happy that you were snooping through his stuff....but  you are his parent and he is going to have to accept that. Good luck....   :~)|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Oh dear! Every Christian parent's worst nightmare. The only thing you can do is to sit him down and discuss it. You have a right to discuss it with him. Don't lose your cool, stay calm and tell him you love him no matter what, then start praying for him.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Do you feed him, clothe him, look after his overall welfare.

Remember, it's not his happiness that matters, its whether or not he goes to he goes to hell for his sins. Also, bring him to church to confess his sins before it's too late. God may take him tommorow, it's up to you as a good christian to save his soul.|`|c18076d5fbdf157f07bd18b41ea3b167aa	How old is your son?<br>  <br>  Just because your beliefs on a certain thing are headed in one direction doesn't mean your child's has to be as well.  It's great to share God with your family and your children, but if your child is possibly homosexual, then you shouldn't try to restrict him from being so.  Some things just happen and restrction upon something he is will make him very unhappy.  Also he may try to hide it from you if you decide to place restrictions on it anyhow.  It's not like he's doing drugs or something.<br>  <br>  If it's such a concern to you, then you could approach him and talk to him about the given situation.  Just don't tell him "he can't do it, it's wrong and immoral."  That's not right at all.|`|zTVVDRkdaa	I hate you mom!
KWYOetbiaa	he wants your *** as well.|`|xZI6noJiaa	He probably laughed cuz he was shocked that you came right out and said it. That being said, telling a guy that out right does more harm than good. Yes it's important to respect yourself and set boundries, but telling your crush that you think all men are dogs will make him not even want to pursue you. He hasn't done anything wrong yet so why should he have to prove that he's not like other guys?<br>  When a guy says to me that his ex was a psycho- I walk away. What she did to him isn't my problem, let someone else 'fix' him.|`|FObM9Mvnaa	Look honey ! Im a married man with kids ( a little girl)  and i'll tell you the same as I'll tell her all young men want one thing.You know what that is .

I would be questioning to myself why do ALL guys want you for sex. What kind of self image are you putting out there that they aren't taking you so seriously? I mean the truth of the matter is that guys tend to want to bang most things in sight but if you keep on getting the same type of guy all of the time then I would seriously question how you are presenting yourself to them and/or the type of guys you tend to go for. If this guy really likes you he will respect you and not try to force you into anything. On second thought he probably thought you were somewhat full of yourself only because you said ALL guys wanted you for your ****. Best of luck and hope this guy is finally the one you've been looking for.|`|FgRiw5CLaa	well it sounds to me like he was laughing at it like being scarsactic like haha really wow but like i wouldn sweat it cuz its like hes saying he dosent care|`|m2PywmHBaa	im not sure what he thought... only he does<br>  but what it sounds lyk is that he thought that he cant believe they would do that to you|`|tZY7sty2aa	I think that's all she good at.

AA10351134	Your dress is very romantic, classic, sort of southern aristocracy. Your fiance's idea of neutral vest and tie is a good one (ivory, champagne, latte, platinum ... any of these will work), but pass on the red bridesmaids gowns and go for a warm rose or pale pink that speaks to the lace in your gown. The red and pink roses will be beautiful. Basically, your ideas are all good, just skip the red in your bridal party attire, it's too harsh here.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I definitley think a deep red on them.

jIsAIwCgaa	No its not a sin!  Your parents are probably just old fashioned. But its not fair for them to be prejudice against anyone for not believing the same details of Jesus' life took place... Or not believing her interpretation of the word. Talk to them and make them realize that THEY are being sinners by judging and and being prejudice|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	First off God suppose to come before everybody and everything!<br>  I don't think it is a sin for you to talk to someone that is not a christian unless they're someone who doesn't believe in God!<br>  But, if you think about that its still judging someone and not loving them!<br>  So, i think if you have feelings for that person, you should continue to talk to them!<br>  You're suppose to be happy no matter what, life is full of decisions and you only have one life to live to LIVE IT UP!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Not a sin, but if you're a strict Christian then you are probably not compatible with a non-Christian anyway.|`|bVROvLNSaa	The issue is being 'unequally yoked'.  The Bible says in  Corinthians 6:14 (New International Version)<br>   14Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?<br>  <br>  You parents are concerned for your purity and for your soul.  <br>  <br>  You are right when you say that the Bible says we are not to judge one another, but it also says that you will know them by their fruits (actions).  Not too many non-Christian young women and girls respect their bodies or their parents from what I have seen.  You would be wise to steer clear of them.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you do more research on this, and respect and obey your parents wishes while you are living under their roof.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Parents can make their minor child do anything they want within reason. That's to answer your last question.<br>  <br>  The Bible does say that you should not be unequally yoked with a spouse. Since the whole idea of dating is to build at least a committed romantic relationship, this applies as well. You're not judging someone by not dating them.<br>  <br>  On that- the Bible is very clear- the type of judgment we are prevented from is whether they re going to heaven or not. We are in fact responsible for judging people's actions.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	its not a sin but u should listen to them!!! someone not christian isnt gonna draw you to God they will draw u away! the bible says dont be unequally yoked since its not specific you should apply it to every area of relationships whether friends or relationships who you date is who you will marry eventually-if you date unsaved ppl you will fall in love with an unsaved person now that is going against the unequally yoked thing therefore sin!|`|afeNK6oSaa	It does say in the bible not to be "yoked" with non-believers, I think paul touched on that subject a bit, but advised that he was not under the direction of the Christ Holy Spirit.  He said to live your life in such the Christian manner that your love and modesty may been seen in the partner and could persuade them eventually. (which ABSOLUTELY can be done...) <br>  <br>  read your bible, check out biblegateway.com for ways to search for those things in scripture.<br>  <br>  But he said specifically not to be yoked with disbelievers, more specifically those who do, persist in and glory in, evil.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Isn't it a sin to disobey your parents?  To answer your question directly no, mind your parents.
dw440Lylaa	Bummer..........it's his problem, you just have to deal with the consequences.<br>  <br>  Be as nice as you can..........and ignore everything he does.<br>  <br>  You're really not in a position to "do" anything........until someone is willing to hear your side of the story, (when their ready, they'll ask), it's impossible to prove something that never happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  I find it ironic that it's perfectly OK for him to be with someone else, but not OK for you, (even though you're not...)...........no double standard here.<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|c5UAa65qaa	You're right; it's none of his business what (or who) you decide to do now that the two of you are broken up.  Ignore him.  As for your "friends," it's up to you whether or not to confront them (has your "inside source" tried to defend you at all, or is she just passing this drama along?), but it might be a good idea to just make plans with people you trust until this all blows over.|`|2YKUepLjaa	He broke up with YOU.  He has no right to be angry even if you did go and sleep with this guy.  He has no control over you and he gave you your freedom the second he broke up with you.  If these people were your friends they would ask you about this and ask if it was true.  Your ex is probably thinking it's unfair that you moved on first, but this was all his choice.  These people are not worth your time or energy.  They can choose what they want to believe but you know the truth and if any of them finally get the courage to talk to you about it, show them your confidence and tell them it isn't true.<br>  <br>  You are allowed to move on.  You aren't dating anyone.<br>  Go be with this guy (who clearly is treating you better than any of them), and cut those other people out of your life.<br>  <br>  I realise this is easier said than done, but I hope you can do it for your sake.  Nobody needs friends that don't even trust them.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|AA10266072	Just ignore him.  He's acting like a kid and so are your "friends."  At your age friends shouldn't be doing things like that.  If they do then they're not your friends.<br>  <br>  Also if he's 24 then he has some serious growing up to do.  I'm 25 and I wouldn't even think of doing something that childish.  Just go hang out with the other guy and have fun.  All your ex is trying to do is make you think about him and as you can see... It's working!|`|n2P9vD1eaa	First and foremost - forget him! He's your ex, an ***, and doesn't deserve the time of day from you. From the sound of it your friends aren't really your friends, and you need to leave them behind. Go with this new guy, have fun, and try to find some people that are worth hanging out with. People who ditch you for some some numb f*** who doesn't know how to treat a women, or thinks about her constantly after breaking up with her (and don't doubt for a second that he doesn't, if that was the case, he wouldn't have given a damn that you were with this new guy), hoping to make her jealous. Just leave that part of your life behind, and get on with the new, happier one! Good luck!|`|rE0Zyopaaa	Sounds like you are not over him yet. If it is over then do not worry about what he thinks. Go to another party and have fun. Show him that you can enjoy yourself without him. <br>  <br>  Dont worry about what he thinks. He if starts rumors then just start some about him. You sound young so go out have fun and dont worry about him.|`|0CKwjdKSaa	Stop playing this childish games. Are you 16 or what?|`|NhORuqjzaa	hun guys suck they all need to grow up... you were being adult about it and moving on if him and ur friends wanna be immature children about then find new friends.... keep ur head up and ur chin in the air dont let pathetic ppl llike them bring u down to their lvl <3 best of luck
YbrVjVJzaa	I definitely wouldn't say you're in the friend zone.<br>  For one thing, she said that you guys "won't call it anything" so that means that she's developing feelings for you, but is unsure, like you said, just got out of a relationship, maybe too fast to get into another one.<br>  next time you guys go out, just tell her that "it's a date whenever you're ready to call it a date."<br>  that way she knows for sure you're interested in her. (i'm assuming that since you are posting this question...)<br>  and more like you're on a one way ticket to becoming something more as long as you take action and keep going out with her, openly flirting with her, etc.<br>  good luck! :D|`|KGAfoVzcaa	She is still in a delicate place right now, and it's important to let her know that you understand and respect that, but you also have to make sure she knows that you are indeed interested in being MORE than friends, otherwise, when she's ready to date, you guys might be so close, she'll see you as a brother and find it weird to be more than that.<br>  Just take it slow, but make it known you're feeling her and see if she is definitely feeling you.|`|NeJZOZ52aa	there is nothing wrong with being in the friend zone...i think that friends is the first step to dating. because when your dating someone you talk to them all the time you hang out frequently and you tell them many secret things so if you are in the friend zone or not...that is where i think you need to get first. then slowly start with some flirting|`|tkFMTz60aa	Well first of all, you already know that she recently gotten out of a relationship. That's a good sign that you are on the friendship path. Just be upfront with her that you think she needs time to heal and that you don't want to be the stepping stone for her.|`|m2PywmHBaa	Jus give her some time be friends with her right now and wen she is ready to date she will come to you its hard coming out of a relationship lyk that its really hard on you so just give her some time and everything will work out|`|y6Fnx4zWaa	The only thing you can really do is be respectful, and talk too her about it.|`|bEaJHY1uaa	i dont think she is ready... so yea your in the friends zone babe... and if she says its nothing then its nothing she would tell you if she wanted more|`|xnULbpgqaa	kiss her cheek or something. if she recoils, give up for now. if she seems to think it was cute or she goes for more, well.. there's your answer.|`|IA9MvEaJaa	start makin moves!|`|UHQGlOPlaa	DON'T BE THE REBOUND!!!!!!. move on and find other girls|`|gvxGhhBxaa	ur in it dude tough luck|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Give her time to think, she just got out of an long relationship and maybe got hurt really bad so she's taking her time...but it sounds like she like you and if you really like her you'd wait on her.|`|mC838ZbLaa	yea you are really sounding like the rebound guy but not the type she wants to date|`|hXFndli2aa	well it sounds like she is interested, but like you said she just got out of a year + relationship and maybe she wants to take things slowly with you to get to know...its good to take things slowly cuz that way you get to know her more and then you can decide to whether you still like her or not.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	you need to make a move and find out. the longer you wait, the closer you are to the friend zone. next time you go out, kiss her on the check or something or just flirt. Don't be just a friend... be a date.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	I think you're just her rebound for right now and there's no much you can do to avoid being just her friend when she's done rebounding|`|0udjgaoBaa	dont act too eager and be confident. Just be cool women like that.|`|gKhR0sgLaa	You can avoid it by being less of a friend, and more of a guy. Flirt with her more, don't go shopping with her for clothes, and don't be like one of her girlfriends.<br>  <br>  Show her that you are great, and show her what you have to offer.<br>  <br>  If she needs time to ease out of her relationship, give her that time.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Honesty is going to be your best policy. You should have said its a date and not hanging out when she asked you. Try tell her its a date next time (if you want it to be something more meaningful than just friends). <br>  <br>  If she rejects you, then she will never be interested anyway, regardless of whether she just came out of a serious relationship or not. Girls usually know what they want. <br>  <br>  BUT if you are just looking for sex from her and nothing else, then do her a favor and move yourself on.|`|dUeDmb7raa	yes you are entering the dreaded "friend zone"<br>  <br>  <br>  you gotta fix the situation, and fast<br>  <br>  <br>  next time you see her, make a move<br>  <br>  <br>  remember you dont have to be dating her to get in her pants|`|fniHoVyaaa	take her a nice quite dinner, and a movie. No "day dates" or you will be in the Friend zone, after you WOO her then you may go on day dates.|`|0VbAMZccaa	why wouldnt you want to be in the friend zone? Do you want her to dump you and stop being your friend?|`|ddf8df78e38155f197807599013a70c1aa	ask her on a date.|`|yoVF60ORaa	wish i knew, i got practically the same problem dude|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	Seriously, I don't believe there's such a thing as 'friend zone'.  The first time I went out with my gf, we had no spark whatsoever, just friends.  Went out a few times, nothing.  But after 6 months, we talked and started dating, things were better and better.  We just celebrated our 7th Valentine's day together.<br>  <br>  This girl you like just got out of a relationship, she may not be ready for a new one yet.  It is a good thing for you, you get the time and space to know each other before making the commitment.  When she feels ready, you will be the first man she sees.  Just hang out with her whenever you get a chance.  Don't listen to those who ask you to make the move.  If you push and she is not ready, she will feel uncomfortable and awkward around you.  You will be out of the game immediately.  You have only one shot, so be patient.
ZlYmbAVQaa	Do something hand made, that really shows you're sorry and you put a lot of effort into what you have made.<br>  <br>  You could make a card or write a letter or something to apologise.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	when she comes home take her to a room and sit down with her quietly and tell her you are sorry and see what she says and put your little sister to bed for her so she doesn't have to do it iron your clothes for school tomorrow and your sisters and maybe she will forgive you|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Make her a card saying I'm sorry <br>  <br>  And then sign a pass that she can use anytime for when she wants you to do something. It'll be cute.|`|RhI0ndT2aa	Honey, when she comes home, give hera big hug and tell her you are sorry again. It's one of those things, where we all snap at each other from time to time.  It happens, just learn that it is easily fixed. Your mom knows this too, and was perhaps just having a bad moment. She may be feeling just as bad as you right now.  Hug and make up. Then put it behind you both. xxx|`|t8swfyD4aa	i know its a pain in the butt to babysit younger siblings, but your mom does do alot for you.  It sounds like she got mad because you made her feel guilty.  All you can do is appologize and really mean it. she will be  mad for a while but eventually she will forgive you. good luck.|`|zm3Kv7Qtaa	dont worry.. parents have moments just like you have your moments... but now you know how she feels when its the other way around. you'll all be back to normal soon an its family, you've said your sorry, later, make a cuppa when she comes in and be normal.. It'l be forgotten about.|`|RLoilwCNaa	I like the card ideas. Don't worry about it, parents get cross sometimes, but a homemade card would be perfect.|`|c2f510c6fde1149e390927bc7646d4c9aa	Saying sorry again is the biggest thing.  And show her you mean it. (which is what you're trying to do i know)<br>  Give her a hug and maybe show her you understand what she does for you.  Maybe by doing a few of her chores to give her some time off, maybe by sitting with your sister so she can have some "me time". <br>  As a mum i know its not about the flowers or the gifts, the gift of time is precious and looking after your sister so she can go phone a friend/have a bath/read a book or even all 3 will mean so much to her.<br>  <br>  You might find she feels a bit guilty as well for taking her 1/2 hour a week.  Its 30 minutes but mums and dads hate to feel as though they are "putting on" their kids and she may have just had her worst feelings come to life.<br>  <br>  She knows you love her whatever<br>  xxx
El4XqmVZaa	My boyfriend's 21st birthday is actually this Sunday.  I asked him what he wanted and well, his response was "alcohol."  I am also nineteen so therefore I cannot buy him alcohol.  But I have the feeling I will end up giving him at least some money so he can buy some himself.  <br>  <br>  I was also thinking of buying him a video game because he is obsessed with his 360.  So you could buy him something like that; movie, video game, or anything else that he has hinted about.<br>  <br>  Also, my boyfriend and I have a lot of inside jokes and little nicknames for each other.  So, I think I might buy him something that may remind him of one of our jokes/nicknames.  For example: I call him my pooh bear so I was thinking of either getting him a really big stuff Pooh or go to Build-a-Bear and make him a customized teddy and name him Pooh.<br>  <br>  Little cute things like that I am sure your boyfriend will truly appreciate.  Otherwise just go with your instinct! You will think of something!<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope this helped a little!|`|wFN8bVqsaa	its his 21..so a flask with his name engraved on it, or a nice bottle of liquor (that is if he is a drinker)
bn38G3QGaa	for one, don't go shopping alone, and do NOT trust older men. Be polite, but walk away if they try to talk to you, or if u feel uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  When i was your age, i seemed to have the same thing. I think its just a bad judgment of age, on a guys part. Lucky for me i had a friend who was a little bit older then me and she was very loud. So she made sure i was safe.<br>  <br>  One time she had an older man looking at her while she was out shopping with her mom. And she couldn't get him to stop starring at her... So she decided to make a scene while he was looking at her, picking her nose! Guess it was really funny!<br>  <br>  Best thing, just stay away from men like that, and make it known that ur not interested. Hope everything goes well|`|PrpLmZoRaa	alright....that's shocking....after i saw the picture, i thought....she can't be 13.....you are at least 20|`|U0WMFNC3aa	Wow! you look a lot OLDER wow i wouldn't even glance at you in that kind of way, not that your unattractive, you look good,but i would think your a lot older than me.  i'm only 15. =)|`|ZHDYHHMQaa	id say pretend to like one and sue there ***!! for rape!
2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	I think your way is fine it's how my husband and I did it. Let your mom do her thing too.It can't hurt and it's a good gesture. It's not like her letter is really introducing themselves since it's just a letter..Congrats and good luck!|`|29I8PWrxaa	My fiance's parents and mine haven't met yet either even though we've been together more than two years.  His family lives across the country from us, and my parents live about five hours away from us ... so it just hasn't worked out that they've met.  We are planning on having a dinner at our house for them to meet each other.  His parents are flying down to stay with my fiance and I at our house for a week, and my parents are going to drive up for one night to have dinner and do the introductions.  That's just the way we are doing things - not sure of the "proper etiquette" on this situation if that's what you are asking for, but personally I think either way is fine.  If your mother wants to send a card and call your fiancee's parents first then I think that's just fine.  Then you can have a dinner for them to meet in person where you can start talking wedding details and have them really get to know each other.|`|L44LBa2Xaa	Having dinner at your apartment sounds fine. <br>  You should do it both.<br>  Have your parents and her parents introduce themselves if they want too.<br>  But formally introduce them together in your apartment.|`|d3icrU62aa	No i think the couple should do it...and over dinner they could also discuss the wedding prep too (if they'll be taking part in it).|`|sgw7xzxBaa	I think the best way to have them meet is to have both sets of parents over for dinner at your place. You don't want to make it seem like an interview. Most are comfortable in a home setting rather than public. Just make it fun and laid back. Maybe a nice BBQ or something outdoors.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	You write: I think my fiance and I should arrange a dinner at our apartment<br>  <br>  I think that is a lovely idea.  I agree with you.|`|8g51eBf1aa	You and your fiance should make dinner for both of your parents. I think that would be the best way for them to meet.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	dinner is best<br>  a nice public restaraunt<br>  not a private home|`|1ayfDeaoaa	Do both.|`|DeQY98MYaa	i think u should take them out for dinner and dessert so they can get to know each other|`|hkwBR1moaa	I think a dinner at your place would be appropriate.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	That's not a bad idea-the card. Or give them a call and have them over for dinner in the house or something at a resturant. Have they met before? Are they okay with you getting married?
wck4MHREaa	Ok, I should retire from answering these questions soon, but here goes. First off, sorry other answer-ers, but just telling her how you feel is a terrible idea. More often than not it just complicates matters, and consider yourself lucky if your friendship withstands this, let alone if anything goes back to normal with this girl.<br>  <br>  Assess if she's really worth it and if it's worth ruining the friendship for. Try getting with 10 other girls first, and if you still think about her, try the following.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't like you for who you are RIGHT NOW, then you need to change stuff about yourself so that she notices a different you. Buy some new clothes, try out a new hairstyle and talk to different, random people often (practice your social skills) so that you can come out as a confident, suave, sophisticated new guy. Oh and most importantly- cut out all contact with this girl; maybe not all contact, but drastically reduce how many times you talk/hang out, etc. Be unavailable to her, be just out of her reach so that she'll miss you a little bit.<br>  <br>  You need her to see you as a different person than you were before- she needs to see you in another light, so that maybe, just maybe, she might consider you as "more than a friend".<br>  <br>  This is not an all-purpose solution though; you can somehow change into Casanova overnight and she still wouldn't have feelings for you. Unfortunately if that happens, you need to give it up, because she just won't change how she feels about you.|`|g0IKBAf9aa	You have to be straight forward and tell her.|`|6CPFRnGraa	Go up to her, look her straight in the eyes and tell her how you feel. After that, the ball is on her side of the court.
KcXFs6Fzaa	Haha yes... and i found all sorts of "treasures" like womans clothes, rings, you name it i found it, and Yes i am glad i did. Its a completely insecure thing to doi agree, and i was definatly insecure about the relationship, but if your insecure and feel the need i feel you guys are together right? so he shouldnt have anything to hide anyways? So just do it secretly, but dont ever tell him that you did it unless you find something really unexplainable!!! But since he caught you just explain the situation, and next time if you feel the need to do it just dont get caught ;) Everybody has or will do it, i dont care what anyone says!!|`|CGlDAvkAaa	What made you start to distrust him? The only reason a girl goes through a guys stuff is if 1. she's insecure about the relationship or 2. she has a reason to believe that she isn't good enough anymore. you have to respect the privacy of others. you wouldn't want him to go through your stuff would you? You can change what you did, but be assured, if he does have anything, you won't find it cause he'll put in in another place not in the apt/house/ETC where you'll look to find it.|`|NeJZOZ52aa	you need to confront him with what ever is bothering you**the reason ur going through his stuff** Because you might not want to admit it but you do it because for some reason you dont trust him. So talk about it cause it could be alot worse|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Fishing for stuff is one thing.Don't ever let them know what you find.<br>  But if you find stuff on accident that is a whole different perspective.<br>  If it's something that is dishonest to your relationship,lose the jerk!|`|6q86rICnaa	No, but that's cuz I really respect privacy and if I guy ever went through my stuff I would be pissed, if there's no trust anymore, just end it.|`|2lx4cgYPaa	i have dumped every girl who i have ever caught going through my stuff.<br>  quickest way to the dog house.|`|U0WMFNC3aa	If he finds out there is a very good possibility he will be your ex.|`|KWYOetbiaa	wowww, you lack values, people have a right to privacy.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	do not go through our stuff...|`|bNllesmMaa	I'm not the most trusting of people, when it comes to relationships.  I've been left alone in my boyfriends bedrooms, and left with the stuff.  But never once have I ever gone through any of there stuff, even when I have had doubts about if there being honest with things.|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	Sometimes it's better to not know  what is in his stuff.  I found out the hard way.  I went thru my b/f wallet and found a condom.  I can not get pregnant, so his excuse was he found it and was going to give it to his nephew!  BS!  I may be crazy but I am not insane!<br>   If you dont want to know the answer to a question, don't ask!  If you don't get what you want to hear, you will worry yourself sick over it!|`|AA10266072	My ex ALWAYS went through my stuff.  If I left her alone in my room she would start going through my phone, my computer, MySpace, Facebook, email, etc.  It was pretty stupid.  In the end it just boiled down to the fact that she didn't trust me.  That's why now... she's my ex.<br>  <br>  So don't make snooping a habit.|`|PyjZVn28aa	girlllllllll...too many times....sometimes iam sucessfull other times iam not...|`|JyEoCBrJaa	i think every girl has done this at one point in time?? except i ended up with a lousy excuse, and left the relationship.
iKD1JUg1aa	she know how you feel about her so stop wasting your time on her...tell her that if she doesnt leave him that your not going to just sit around and watch her get treated like that your going to leave her alone maybe shell realize what she is losing over him...and if she doesnt move on your young and there area alot of fish in the sea you can find one that appreciates you more.....|`|bXF1gDTcaa	sounds like she's playing with you. saying what she needs to to keep you around for when she's off again with the jerky boyfriend. to get over her, you'll probably need space, but at the same time you'll still wanna be her friend, make sure she's safe and stuff still. be there for her, but keep your distance unless she approaches you. this will either help you move on or possibly make her realize you're who she really needs.|`|Ux8ei5i5aa	If she is getting abused and she is 15 you should let someone know...like her parents! Obviously she is unstable or she wouldnt be in this type of relationship. Maybe it is best you be there for her as a friend right now. Who knows what the future may bring.|`|AA12198711	Then be a friend. <br>  <br>  A friend is sometimes more valuable to a person th=an the one they think is their boyfriend.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Bide your time until shes ready for you.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	It's nothing much you can do, don't put yourself in that position to get hurt because she keeps running back to him and it seems to me that she's playing with your emotions. She seems really lost and confused and don't know what or who she wants, just back away and wait for them to completely be over with or find someone new any girl would be lucky to have you, you sound like a really great guy.Good luck
YrBnLhDZaa	wow..well it seems like he wants you 2 get to know him more as a person and maybe the movies symbolizes who he is and what he is about and what he likes.He sounds either shy or he doesnt express himself alot or maybe he isnt open..best advice is to talk to him and try and make him open up and ask questions because communication is the key 2 a relationship.but i dont kno about the feeling if he doesnt express gimself how can you know if feeling are being developed????..he just has 2 open up and not alot of guys open up..sooo good luck if anything email me at ashley.s.cadet@gmail.com|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	Ok girl, I'm confused, too.  Do you guys DO stuff together?  Do you talk a lot?  <br>  I would think it's safe to say that if you're hanging out together doing stuff, just the two of you, he's got a thing for you and he's not looking to be best friends.  And in that case, he's giving you his favorite movies to watch because he likes them and wants to share a bit of himself with you.  Guys open up in weird ways.......  Go with it and see where it leads. =)|`|32Ckn6Pvaa	He may very well like you. Maybe he's just not like all the other guys you've dated and he actually wants to get to know you on a personal level. He could be shy or maybe this is his way of flirting. Have you tried flirting with him to see what he does? Maybe give it a try and see how he reacts...<br>  <br>  My boyfriend (well now fiance) never really flirted with me when we first started out. He wasnt trying to get into my pants so he was trying to make an effort to get to know me. Maybe this is what your man is trying to do.|`|LETd2hQwaa	Hey, I'm 24 and I have a simple solution. <br>  <br>  GUYS are SIMPLE. With that said, just ask him what's up with him.

"You want me, huh?" lol--- kidding. Seriously though, it sounds like he's interested but just trying to get to know you better and see if you're really what he wants. He's showing you a side of him that he hopes interests you. I'd say he is interested, just not very direct in his approach. Also he's still searching for himself and has to make sure he's ready for what he maybe looking to get into with you.

Your not quite an adult and yet you are not a child. This is the time where most teenagers get depressed and sometimes suicidal. You need to talk to someone either a family member, friend or even a guidance councilor at school. Do not keep pushing your feelings down, let them out.  I did the very same thing that you are doing now and I ended up having a mental breakdown. The best thing to do is to talk to someone you can trust.  I never that option and if I did I would not have had the breakdown. I hope this helps and good luck remember it will get better that I promise you.|`|AA10042205	I have gone through exactly what you are talking about.  I didn't do well in school, I hated it.  I prayed to god to take me to Heaven, and why did I have to live in America.  I was told I was a ugly kid, with bad acne.  I worried about things that really never came to pass.  If you can't talk to your parents, just walk into any church, and talk to a preacher that doesn't know you, if that would make you more comfortable.  But please ask a best friend or someone you really enjoy talking with.  I'm sure glad God didn't take me to Heaven when I begged him to.|`|njWh5Kobaa	I've been there done that. And i ended up in therapy. <br>  Something good to do is write in a journal every night before bed , if your not going to tell anyone, at least get your feelings out somewhere. <br>  Longer you spend depressed , the more time your letting your life pass you by.

Mostly in the woods but it progressed into mostly running by the time I was an adult. I ended up really pretty good at it and went on to college. By then I found myself and am pretty happy now. You can work out your problems on your own with a little hard work and determination. I'm guessing that you hate telling people how you feel is because you don't really know what to say. You could try finding a therapist to talk to they could coach you on what you need to say to get it out. But I think that finding something physically demanding will help you settle down. But it's not something you can do for a few minutes a day Im talking hours. Even if you take  up boxing or something. If you're in to the internet a lot start studying up on the economy and money. Money always makes people happy. Learn how to spend it so it'll make you more. Just relax and remember life isn't supposed to be easy. Keep your head up and things will work out. You'll be tested a lot just push through.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  Who knows maybe you'll be in the olympics or a millionaire someday because you learned how to focus that engery into something more postive for yourself.|`|lzYgTtN6aa	I know you might not like this but for me, yahoo answers helps a lot. People you don't know, will never have to see and can't judge you can give you advice and you don't even have to speak to them face to face. Don't let youself get overly depressed and I know this is hard but every teenager feels like this at some point in life whether it's for a long or short period.<br>      If you don't feel like this would help you, you should find someone who you really trust and know will listen to you and tell them. Even if you don't feel comfortable saying it to their face, write it down and give it to them in the form of a letter. But make sure you trust them completely because if not, the letter could get into the hands of someone else. Good luck and try cheer up. We're all here for you! =)|`|19ILDxBsaa	well, i don't know how you'd feel about this but insurances cover therapists and things like that.  I work at an insurance company and it's unreal how many teens go see therapists.  it's really unhealthy to not talk about things and having someone outside of your group of friends or family to tell everything to, it helpss like you wouldn't believe.  <br>  <br>  I'd really suggest calling your insurance company and asking for a list of therapists in your area that you can go to.  Soooo many teens do it, it's completely normal and really good for you.|`|srNze5uIaa	I will tell you what I personally do: I talk with a friend on the internet. There is anonymat, so you are protected, you can be sincere, and the people out there can help you.<br>  <br>  Or go out as much as you can, try to find something you love and it will keep your brain occupied, especially that depression usually has a time periode, it will pass if there is a stimulus, ... so, at worse, be patient.|`|LRwQEnLnaa	Tell a close friend or family member or you could tell someone you hardly know because in that way you won't feel like they know about your personal life.

Go with it!  <br>  And just so you know, I had a strange conversation with my 9 year old last night discussing just this.  He asked why it is that seriously hot women will marry big fat ugly guys.  Well, I had to explain to him that once women reach a certain maturity level they no longer seek outer appearance. They seek the true nature of a guy in his sense of humor, his attitude, his level of caring and intelligence and a bunch of other good "inside" junk.  We are able to find out best friends and lovers in the strangest shells, but we'll never notice becasue they'll be perfect in our eyes because of what we found INSIDE.

Make sure you are familiar with the "Four Cs" of diamond quality before purchasing. The 2-carat stones in this price range often have one or more of the following: visible inclusions (flaws), mediocre color quality ("faint yellow"), and/or a lower grade "cut" (which affects the "brilliance" of the diamond). <br>  <br>  The sterling silver band would probably cost you $150.00|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Anywhere in between <br>  <br>  $50.00-$110.00|`|uAhqtWuyaa	Depends were u go .025--.50 it can cost u up to 2000 just depends and the ring in silver no more than 150.

Also get an STD test to be safe sometimes you get stuff and never know about it so.... oh that boy you think about he's such a loser to be doing stuff like that!|`|LOVCVuu5aa	Go to your doctor who can refer you to see a counsellor. Talking to someone about things like this makes you feel so much better you wouldn't believe, and these people are there to help, its there job so you might as well use them! :) They wont judge you at all, they are there to listen and give you guidance.<br>  <br>  If you trust your boyfriend then tell him, or maybe you'll feel more comfortable telling him after you've seen a counsellor.

They'll be able to help you on your psychological issues.<br>  <br>  But as for dealing with your issues right now, just try to do things to get your mind off of it and talk to people about it.  It'll make you feel better about things in the long run.  Old memories are never easy to get rid of.

He wouldn't blush when you looked at him and when his friends said anything for no reason. He is probably just really shy and is scared to ask you out. So just stay friends with him and see what happens. In fact maybe you should ask him to see a movie or go get a bite to eat.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	i think he likes u but u shouldn't push it. he sounds like one of those shy boys that u have to be subtle with. u have to make the first move on him, but not too big a leap. if u need more help, u should go to google.com and type in what u want to know.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|USuUMIlHaa	this happened to me,and we still haven't resolved the situation and it massively affected our friendship.<br>  find time for him every day and just carry on like that.<br>  he knows how you feel,and you know howw he feels.<br>  If you're confident enough,ask him out!|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Aww how cute!

Yea he definitely likes you...go with the flow. Try not to tell your friends too much as you can see their teasing you guys over it which can makes matters worse. You like him and its definitely obvious he likes you. Maybe pull him aside and chit chat with him when your or his friends aren't around Good Luck!<br>  p.s. He wont approach you because he is SHY and its probably hard to talk to you...which somewhat stinks because you want to know how he is feeling but thats just how it is...i use to hate that but there is really nothing to do but to maybe pull him aside and talk with him while others especially your friends ARE NOT AROUND that sometimes makes it worse...stay calm and collective ...everything will fall into place

atJOyPlwaa	be straight out about it..she'll be pretty shocked id imagine in the first place<br>  tell her from the heart how you feel, you dont want to lose her to cancer like a lot of people do due to smoking. <br>  it is initally down to her and stress could have brought this on in the first place but hearing your opinion im sure she will take it into consideration.<br>  dont expect too much too soon, its not easy giving up!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	She is an adult, you are a child. She doesn't have to answer to you. You are to respect her. If she chooses to, so be it. She shouldn't have to keep it a secret though. <br>  Also, she's under alot of stress with you're grandma dying. If you decide to harass her, you'll only make it worse. <br>  So just let her go. <br>  If my sister and I acted that way toward my father, we would have got the belt. Consider yourself lucky.|`|xHvnGjCKaa	Tell your mum how you feel along with your sister. And ask her if she's ok as well.

Say that you know she can do it, she is a strong person and did it before. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, tell her you love her but ultimately she has to decide to do it, or she will never be completely free.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	Your mum is probably under a lot of stress because of your grandmother's condition. Smoking can help with stress but ultimately it's very bad for your health. <br>  My advice would be to leave your mum until the situation with your grandmother has been resolved and then try to ask her to stop.<br>  Ja.

AA11101806	you might as well just start seeing the other guy and tell your current boyfriend about it when he has the time.

zDhTTGlxaa	They say that guys are interested in things and women interested in people. So if this is true....ask a guy WHAT he is interested in first...<br>  What about his car, does he like old cars, does he have a favourite or a first car he remembers and cherished.<br>  What does he do..though don't dwell on this one because he may really hate his job, but this could give you the opportunity to be a 'sympathetic' ear. if he is in to it he may go into quite lengthy detail.<br>  Economics or more like ask if he knows good sources for deals on anything from household stuff to clothing, if he goes really mad on the clothing and looks like a 'peacock' run....no woman should have to put up with a vain fashion obsessed man, unless it is his trade in which case fashion becomes a good point to talk about. <br>  Skills. give him a chance to show off...what can he do? DIY, football, what?<br>  Now move on to people...who does he like in TV and Film? does he have a favourite statesperson, (without getting too political)<br>  How about his family/ does he have children from a previous marriage? most will say this is NOT the thing to talk about..why? If this person is a good man he will not want to hide from you if you both want the relationship to progress, if he does want to lie, what is he hidding? he may well breathe a sigh of relief that you have interest in a family and are not afraid to ask. <br>  These questions will prompt their own relevant questions, you will not memorise 10! use these to kick off the sort of questionning that a good conversation should consist off.....and relax be yourself.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Aww congrats for getting back on the scene. <br>  <br>  However.. you want to go out on a date.. not an interview. The best way to start conversations is talk about things that interest you...<br>  <br>  "Oh my gosh, guess what I saw on the news today..."<br>  <br>  That's the best way to get a conversation going AND you find out where he stands on things like religion, politics, current events.. that kind of stuff..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|aiRn2lQGaa	I would ask the important questions. Ask him things that are important for you in a relationship like religious beliefs, where he stands morally on certain things, and of course the typical flirting. it may seem straight forward but there's no use in wasting your time|`|KG6E8br0aa	What he does for a living<br>  does he have children<br>  what interest him<br>  what does he look forward in a woman<br>   (try to see if you guys have something in common)<br>  sorry but i have to go :D hopefully it helps these are the questions to get a conversation going and then have funbut yeah im a guy :D bye|`|xIeW0zTHaa	This is a difficult scenario to size up, first of all on a first date you don't want to tell too much information to someone too soon and I am sure he feels the same, unless you just know in your heart that this is going to be a long term or lead to marriage, There are some critical aspects of his life that you may like to know; Does he have a girlfriend? How long did his last relationship last?, and why did it break up? what do you expect from your date? What kind of family problems does he have( children, ex-wife, money, drugs, diseases) Are you employed or financially stable or ableto support yourself.|`|7En0G0oqaa	u can start the conversation by asking about his intrests and telling about ur intrests then landing over to fav 's of his and ur's ten telling and talking about his fav things and telling about ur fav things and good music will help it lot i guess..........!!!!!!!!|`|CGlDAvkAaa	Why wouldn't you take things naturally? Let the guy take the lead. But let me ask you, what do you want to know about him? You could start there. Don't get too personal, but ask what he likes to do for fun? or what kind of  food he likes to eat. I wish you the best my friend, the dating world is crazy, new words and age differences that don't really matter any more.|`|e3VerZPYaa	what kind of music do you like? that can really tell a lot about a person

They were all ordered January 31st.  That's a little more than 5 months.  <br>  <br>  You have to keep in mind that dresses will take longer during certain times of the year.  Late winter tends to be when most brides start shopping because there are SOOOO many engagements between Christmas and Valentine's Day!|`|zSABr7praa	I picked mine out a year away from my wedding, let my bridesmaids know which one I wanted, then had the fitting at 8 months.  I let them each choose their favorite dress, then I picked my favorite from the bunch.  The way I look at it, they're paying for it..they're keeping it.. they should have something they can wear again.  Let them have SOME say in it.. and give notice so they have time to set money aside!|`|ODYrypwaaa	Once you found the right one! It takes 6 weeks to get the dresses in and then 6 weeks to get them altered.  Plus we used the wedding dress and the bridesmaid dress as a the feel of the wedding.  So if we bought formal dresses we had a formal wedding, but if we got short dresses it was more casual.|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Well, you can also at least give some time for your bridesmaids to lose a little weight before buying a dress LOL.<br>  <br>  4-6 months is usually the ideal time before the wedding, you have to have ample time to have it fitted and altered just in case.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would defninitly start looking now. Start with local places and the popular chain stores. I think you should have the dress you want, or getting close to it, 4 months before the wedding.|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I started looking at 8 months and everyone told me that I started "just in time". I thought I was starting early, but depending on how many girls you have, if any are out-of-state, and where you get the dresses from, it can never be too early....Just make sure that if you haven't picked out your colors yet you get a dress that comes in different colors. <br>  <br>  P.S. My girls are getting their dresses for $150 at Alfred Angelo, but some found the same dress, unwarn and unaltered on eBay for $19 - $40.|`|lw9w05vRaa	Typically at least 6-8 months before the wedding --- so that they can be made and shipped in time and then have time for your girls to get alterations.|`|8g51eBf1aa	6-8 months before. The earlier the better, especially if your getting married during a busy time [for weddings.] April-June is extremely busy for bridal shops.|`|aipChC3haa	4 months before.

QMAqzpKEaa	Yes, it is emotional black mail and a pathetic means to win a girl back when all else has failed. That would lead to a pathetic relationship, because the girl would, more than likely be with him because she feels sorry for him. He needs help. The girl should give him the number of a counselor or psychiatrist or tell his parents or siblings or close friends if she is majorly concerned.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	This is a trick to manipulate. It happens all the time actually. It's best to point them to a professional and not get involved with them.|`|4HoVVCenaa	This is emotional blackmail. The girl should refuse to accept such responsibility. The guy is sick.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	From what I've experienced people don't really talk about killing themselves , they fire off a few warning shots and then take their own life . If you are in this predicament then get out NOW  , don't feel guilty if he follows through with his threats , just think of whatyhe could have been capable of before he killed himself , it takes a lot of guts to kill yourself so what are you capable to achieve when alive  before walking off the edge of darkness .|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	who would want to be with someone so self-desturctive? the girlfriend should report her boyfriends suicidal thoughts to someone, family or professional ,ad get him medical help before he kills himself! and he shouldnt stay with him if it isnt working out.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	generally, it normally seems a lot worse than it actually is.|`|mrysAOpGaa	if he says that, that means he is trying to have control over you, because he knows that youre a good hearted caring person and dont want that to happen, so hes saying if you leave hell kill himself knowing you wont leave because of that.  It is deff. a control thing and hes winning.  If he is seriousl, you need to get him help, but you need to get out of the relationship, its unhealthy.  You cant stay with someone and be unhappy just because youre scared hell do something irrational. get away now hun, bcause hell only become more controling|`|mj52nmKtaa	I have a psychologist friend and my boyfriend's uncle is one too, so they once told me that people who tell you they are gonna do it, they aren't really. This guy has some serious issue and should seek help immediately before he actually does something stupid. He is completely obsessed and that's not healthy. Actually, my ex boyfriend done something similar to that sending me pictures of his wrists cut open and telling me he was going to kill himself, it's not a nice thing to say and then we're stuck to a relationship we don't want due to selfishness of the partner.|`|5MuTwO6naa	this guy as issue's beyond your relationship.if you are not happy then there is a reason for that.find someone who will be there for him when you break it off,a friend or relative maybe.don't be held over a barrel if you are not happy with this guy.if he finds a way and does commit suicide you have got to be believe it is not your fault.good luck.|`|CadIYXdXaa	It is an abusive relationship, as someone else said it is emotional blackmail and abuse.<br>  <br>  He needs psychiatric help and should seek it out right away. If he gets help there may be a way for them to save their relationship.|`|An2KCMnwaa	Relationships are no joke, people kill and die when they break up. It's better to repel someone by being a nu sense than to leave.|`|u8HYfTnyaa	that is mentally abusive. you should tell him that if he loves you, he should be willing to let you go.|`|AA10554882	That's emotional abuse.  No questions about it.|`|jWPF6QR6aa	sounds like a psycho to me, i wouldn't pay much attention to it.|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	I went through an abusive relationship with my boyfriend about 10 years ago, where he actually put a knife to my throat. I slaped a retraining order on his but so fast, his head started spinning. So yes, the realationship that you are in is abusive. If I were you, I would slap a restraining order on his but. To tell you the truth, if action is not taken and he winds up leaving you because he cannot get his way, 80% of the time they will come back, and it will be for the kill. You will have to go through the courts in your area to do this, but it will protect you and he will not be able to come 30ft. from you without being arrested. Hope this helps.|`|r3O9XCSBaa	I would say that would be just a way for you not to leave him. it sounds possessive and controlling. They guy sounds like he has separation issues. But if you do not want to be with this person then please do what you need to do. Maybe you should go to the sheriffs office and tell someone what he is going. If he is suicidal then he needs to get Professional help.|`|lfN4WuWzaa	Well the guy clearly needs mental help. If they say they are going to kill them self that's one step away from killing someone else. If I were them I would get out as soon as they can. If they can they should contact the proper individuals. ie school guidance councilor, or if they are in college the campus police or people from health and human services.|`|a4ff01aeb2a7fc2631439b2f01a02c27aa	It aint an emo blackmail....<br>  it has happened to me ...she left me and i lost my right leg...<br>  it doesnt mean i am sick......but i always remember her through out my life when i see my leg......Its just wat u ppl call is "TRUE LOVE"|`|5nAnWp3daa	if you stay out of pity not good for any of you and honestly get away from that nut.
0jUGSaZPaa	My sister always told me this.. (She works in Retail Credit Management | HSBC North America)<br>  Get about 5 credit cards.<br>  Use each of them every month, but in small amounts... Like gas, or a few things here and there... Maybe like $20-40 a month on each.<br>  Then, pay them off when the statement is due.<br>  It will help your credit score and not worry about "inactivity"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It's always good to have a credit card, but using your band card is good enough.

It's actually good to use it a few times as long as you pay it off-you don't have credit if you don't use it-get it?|`|R7b150Iyaa	You should use your cards interchangeably every month, for things like groceries, household items, and gas.  That way, they are being used and you can still afford to pay them off at the end of the month.  As far as low limits go, if you've had the cards for a while and are a good and loyal customer (and always pay your bills on time), call and ask for an increase.  They are more than likely to grant it.<br>  BTW, why is this in the weddings section?<br>  Good luck!|`|29I8PWrxaa	You might get more helpful responses to this in another section ... perhaps the Finance section.|`|d3icrU62aa	wrong section...maybe you should go to finance|`|12VQ4ETcaa	It looks better on your credit report if you close an account than if the company does.<br>  <br>  The downside to closing any account is that it takes that part of your credit history with it.  I would keep open the older accounts and close the newer ones.  I would also choose to close any store cards in favor of Visa or MasterCard that you can use anywhere.|`|8g51eBf1aa	Buy one thing on your credit card every 6 months. Then pay it off right away.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	If it is having a negative impact, then close them. It's obviously not helping you, so get rid of them. :)
pbrfZQ53aa	You are caught in the "Friend Zone". Its a nasty place where the girl talks, seemingly flirts, and likes you but ONLY as a friend. I say move on to other girls. Let her know shes missing out. If she ever matures enough to realize it then give her a chance, MAYBE, IF shes lucky.|`|KLZGmyL4aa	ur in the 7th GRADE and already have girl problems :/..wow!<br>  anyways, u should prob ask her if she likes u or not, like that u can get any doubts out of ur mind, who knows she might like u :)<br>  and if she says yes, then just go out, have fun, be yourself..|`|KjJFgBEIaa	Yes she is flirting and she might have a little thing for you so go for it!! haha just hang with her and become buds and just kinda tell her you kinda like her and want to know how she feels about you and if her to then hook up! but if not then just be buds and find another one... many fish in the sea! <br>  good luck|`|FXJqbNAtaa	well, i wouldn't make a move just yet considering that she already has a boyfriend. but keep talking to her and stuff, and if she really does like you, then eventually she'll dump him
ahjqc9Ifaa	He gave you up, made no contact, and doesn't want contact now. What part of "no" are you struggling to understand?<br>  <br>  Of course it's his loss (who could have no interest in their own child or grandkids?), but he's proven himself disinterested in you all your life, and your contacting him has not changed that.<br>  <br>  Let him go, move on, be happy this jerk is not in your life. Who needs it? Surround yourself with people who care.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I think that you have to let him go. He's obviously has some issues. Maybe too consumed in his career? I'm not sure what it is. It's not you, it's him, trust me. Don't go on thinking that you're not worthy of his love or anything like that. Something is wrong with him. You have a career and children and a life of your own that hasn't included him ever, so focus on that, and let him go since he obviously has issues of his own that you shouldn't be a part of.|`|t8swfyD4aa	im in the same boat as you are, with having never known my father, then finding him and then being rejected by him.  i think all you can do is move on and let him go.|`|lgPEAAHJaa	Thats really sad being rejected by your dad but your just have to move on.. hes not going to change his mind if hes never met you and your 28.. but still thats really upsetting xx|`|PK498w0Saa	Write to him telling him how much your children would like to have a real grandfather, and that it could change his life for the better. It wouldn't have to take him over, but a few new faces around the Sunday dinner table every so often should be a valuable thing. Say to him how hard you've been trying to find him and that you're disappointed that he's blanking you. Tell him you just want to talk to him, and he ought to give you at least that one thing after having a child and ignoring them their whole life. <br>  If you keep getting negative answers back after this then I would say stop asking, because eventually if you nag him it will cause upset for you and your children and it will be better for everyone emotionally if you just leave it.<br>  Good luck, I really hope you get through to him.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	I feel he needs to see you first, then his heart will change. Get into your car and go see him at his work and be nice. It's hard to reject somebody who arrives with a box of chocolates and a really nice card, leave it on his desk if he doesn't want to speak to you, but I think he will want to speak to you once you are there. <br>  <br>  Make sure you look your best and smell your best when you go. Expect rejection beforehand, so that in case there is more rejection, it won't be another disappointment.<br>  <br>  I also never met my father and I'm 42.|`|7i0r7DZoaa	You should tell him that for your whole life you have been searching for him and wondering where he is.So then when you get a letter back saying he doesn't want anything to do with you, explain how that made you feel. And mention your four lovely children, and tell him you have been searching for him for 10 whole years, and the stress and waste of time it has been.Also, tell him you are NOT after his money. Only his love, and you have (I assume) been longing for it all your life, and long to have a proper family and a (Biological) dad who loves you just like any other would. Say you two have missed out on a lot together, and even if he never wants to meet you, just keep writing to him. Keep writing to him countless letters telling him you love him even though you have never met, and wait until he gives in. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I REALLY hope you get to meet him. I have been with my real family all my life and can't imagine how sad it would be. I felt really sad for you when I read this, and nearly cryed! Good luck, and I cannot tell you how much I want you to meet him and have a GREAT life!|`|OI4gWVfNaa	This is truely sad. My husband has an 8 year old that the mother keeps from him and we can't afford to take her to court just yet but I am afraid she will disappear again like she did for five years and I fear that my step son will have to search for us when he gets older if we lose him again but I know my husband wants nothing more then do be in his life.<br>  <br>  If you father wants nothing to do with you and your children then it is his lose. some fathers don't realize how men need there fathers in there life. I wish you the best of luck and hopefully he wakes up and realizes we live one life and wants to be apart of y'alls life
sGP6s7uraa	Of course you can do it!  It's an awesome idea, too ;)  <br>  <br>  If your wedding is on a Saturday, I would make them either the Wednesday or Thursday before.  They'll stay fresher BUT you can also make them way ahead of time (like 2 or 3 months before the wedding day) and then freeze them.  Make sure you defrost in the refrigerator.|`|ODYrypwaaa	For a grooms cake you can do anything really.  If you want brownies get brownies.  Maybe have them individually wrapped.  Or get a icing bag and put your initials on it.  However, for the actual  "Cake"  more traditional is better otherwise that could look a little silly and cheap.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Brownies is a great idea! It's different and will be unique for your wedding! Way to think outside the box! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1181/1356631405_fe326bdfd4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1181/1356...</a>|`|2kl0vQjVaa	I would make them no more than a day or 2 before to ensure freshness.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	sure its your wedding and what ever you want is what should go. You could do brownies in shaped cake pans (round, hexagon..ETC) and then cover them with ganache or leave them plain.<br>  <br>  For my cousins wedding I made her a rice crispy wedding cake....so your options are limitless! <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  you could make them a few weeks ahead of time and freeze them, wrap them in plastic wrap and foil to prevent drying out and defrost in the fridge, <br>  or if you have time you could make them Thursday and wrap them and keep them in the fridge to prevent drying.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	For our groom's cake, my mom is making her famous chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter icing. Brownies are totally fine!|`|ow4Ec8eqaa	Go ahead do whatever you'd like.  It's good to be unique:)<br>  Best wishes!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah wedding cake sucks.  I don't know why people pay hundreds or thousands of bucks on wedding cakes because they're always dry and blech.  I think you should have pies or brownies as an option too, that's a good idea.  make brownie sundaes for everyone for dessert.  I would have a baker make the pan of brownies the day of the wedding, or the day before if it will stay fresh.  leave it up to them, they're professionals.  hvae it decorated with your wedding colors on top and then at the reception, slice it and serve with ice cream!  I'm a genius!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can serve whatever you want instead of cake. Most people love brownies. I wouldn't put them on a cupcake tier personally. Just use the silver platters that you can get at any party store. <br>  <br>  As far as when to make them, do it as late as possible to make sure that they are fresh and moist. Have your moms and bridesmaids help out so that it isn't so overwhelming for you on your own.
w7C363Ljaa	I just took my engagement ring off before the ceremony and put it back on right after....My friend had hers soldered together, I think she had it done about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks before the wedding. There's not a right or wrong way of doing it, just do it however you want, it's your wedding. Congratulations!|`|R7b150Iyaa	Yeah, soldering them together seems a bit weird.  What if you want to wear just your wedding band sometimes?  Let's say you ever travel to a not so safe country like Turkey or Egypt, you definitely wouldn't want to walk around with a flashy diamond but they won't let you stay in a hotel room together if you're not wearing a wedding ring.  Totally random scenario, lol, but there will be times in life where you won't need your engagement ring.<br>  <br>  I think I might just wear my engagement ring on my right hand and then put it on top of the wedding band after the ceremony?  It seems weird if he puts on the wedding band on top of my engagement ring, I feel like it'll be more special if we're both not wearing any rings on that finger prior to the wedding band.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!<br>  Good luck =)|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I thought it was common practice to have the rings soldered together before the ceremony.  That is what my jeweler said is the "usual" and it usually only takes one week, but they recommend giving an additional week to ensure nothing is wrong and it came out perfect.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I had mine soldered together before the ceremony, then gave the whole thing to the best man the night before at the rehearsal.It worked out best that way because then I didn't have to be without it afterward, and it always looks perfect- no twisting or turning around on my hand.|`|sGP6s7uraa	My w-ring will include my engagement ring (it's a diamond guard and the e-ring will slip between the bands).  Some women wear their e-ring on their right hand during the ceremony and then afterwards, if they want and if it looks good, they slip it onto their left.  It's up to you really.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I always thought you either wore the e-ring on your right hand or you didn't wear it at all that day.<br>  <br>  IF you were going to have them soldered together then it would make sense to do that before the wedding and have them put on as one.|`|B9fwuaSlaa	I haven't married yet but my mother had them soldered together about a week before the ceremony and didn't wear them again until during the ceremony. It looks really gorgeous together.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	My wife put hers on her right hand before the ceremony. After that you can solder them.Good luck!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I am getting my soldered together a couple weeks before the wedding. I think that is competely normal.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah just have the groom put it on top of your engagement ring and switch them later.  I never knew which ring goes first and which goes second, I don't think it matters.  but don't get them soldered until after the wedding.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Most people wear their engagement ring on their right hand during the ceremony, so the wedding band is placed closest to the heart.  The engagement ring is moved over to the left hand after the ceremony.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Most of my friends who got married this summer either wore their engagement ring on the opposite hand or just left it on it's usual finger, and then switched the order of the engagement and wedding rings on their finger after the ceremony. They especially wanted to have their engagement rings on for pictures before the wedding ceremony.<br>  <br>  If you think that any of your guests will be able to tell you have an engagement ring on during the ceremony, you are being way too optimistic about their vision. They won't be able to see a thing, and it won't look "weird."|`|gnCiGSjbaa	I Always thought that you were your engagement ring on the other hand until after the ceremony then put it back on the correct finger. Make sure the band is first.|`|KweMUxUdaa	My GF just got married and she had her rings soldered together before the wedding, it is not weird, it will just help so that you don't have both rings going in opposite directions on your finger all of the time|`|zSABr7praa	It took me 6 weeks to have my ring resized, I think 2 weeks would be pushing it.  <br>  <br>  I had my husband slip my band on top of my engagement ring.  I'm not such a fan of getting the rings soldered together.  My husband asked me not to because for a 10 or 20 year anniversary gift, he'd like to upgrade my ring, and it wouldn't be as special if he had to get another wedding band to go with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mine has diamonds across the entire band... 6 was appropriate.<br>  <br>  I didn't take offense!  I was just told by our jeweler that because it was a custom ring it would take longer.  I wasn't bothered by the length of time it took, I understand the privately owned jewelers can not complete jobs as quickly as the larger stores.
AA11938007	If she is interested she will let you know. I would go about my business and move on,|`|ayNhwPY3aa	Act normal. Be yourself. Be friendly. Maybe it is too soon for her to be in a relationship. Maybe she is not ready for one. Just try to keep it on simple terms and stay friendly. Do so, in a way that she will know the door is always open. Some guys just move too fast for some woman and that is why the men get told no. Take it slow.|`|YrMRlWzyaa	Maybe she's just catious which in my opinion is a smart thing for her to do. Don't avoid her, try talking to her and keeping it casual, after a while you'll feel more comfortable with each other and she might give you her number.|`|DsgQEeknaa	ever she didn't fancy you or she's playing a game........ or maybe she's<br>  not ready for love yet. if i was in your place i would walk away and wish she didn't exzist or wait and see if she will give you her number this time.

If you were sure that she liked you though, she might just be afraid of the whole guy hormone deal.  Try going on a date or something before asking again or try e-amil adress.  THis is coming froma girl.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	She's either not interested or she's already in a relationship. Just be normal around her.

Not your fault. You held high expectations so now it's time to let it go. First and foremost... let this be a lesson you've learned. Second... observe, carefully, why you thought she liked you. Could it be that you were 'oversexualizing' her behavior? That's where you need to becareful. Or could it be your infatuation that has made you totally blind to all of her 'get away from me' body language? <br>  <br>  Pick up signs from women. Practice practice and practice. Eye contact is something I would focus on the most. Glance once... if she glances again... and again... or keeps her gaze at you for more than 3-4 seconds. That's a green light. So smile.. and if she smiles... then there's your other green light. <br>  <br>  However, becareful.... by taking risks... you are putting them at risks... in other words... you are desperately 'hoping' that by going up to them... and asking them out... then they would say 'YES'. Even with all of those green lights... some women may not mean to interpret that as " Hey, I like you. Come over here."<br>  <br>  If they say no... take it seriously... then move on to the next woman. don't focus on one.... but focus on MANY! Good luck.|`|IwQa2zkEaa	Act normal and try to move on. She could be a player, shy, or even uninterested. Try to live your life and pretend like nothing happened. If you try to seem less interested, and she really does like you. her behaviour will change and it will be very obvious. <br>  <br>  Be careful with her though, she sounds like a heart breaker.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	If she refused to give you her number that's a pretty clear sign she's not interested. Sorry.|`|Khs7HBYmaa	I WOULD JUST ACT NORMAL SO SHE DOESNT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. LET HER DO THINGS IN HER OWN TIME.|`|cvVMJQRZaa	Move on to the next one.

Limos can be late, priest can be late, a brides maids strap could break, anything.  <br>  <br>  Getting ready for the wedding is an all day thing.  I got ready at my parents house, and had 3 stylist come to do mine, my mothers my m-i-l, and my bridesmaids hair and makeup.  We had a nice brunch, and spent the afternoon getting pretty.  Do not, I repeat, do not do any drinking.  I had a few glasses of champagne, and had to drink 4 redbulls at 4pm because I was getting sleepy.  We had the photographer there for the getting ready portion, but many people do not.<br>  If the ceremony starts at 6, it's not unlikely that it could start at 630..even 7.  Mine ran 45 minutes late because of the limos.  Then, generally, you take photos.. which can take about an hour.  Getting out of there in 15 minutes isn't going to happen.  <br>  <br>  Even if it's 15 minutes away, you need to allow atleast 45 minutes for your guest to get there, get a drink, enjoy the cheese and veggies (if you have them) mingle for a second, and find their seats.  We gave our guest an hour.  <br>  <br>  Try to relax, and not worry about the timing.. I had a strict schedule that completely fell apart, the wedding was amazing anyways.
LVlS4y7Caa	Well it's hard to identify, as I loved my mother more than life itself and she's gone from my life now...What I did?  I'd drive to where she lived, tell her to pack a bag and that I was taking her up the coast for a couple of days - just the two of us.  We'd stop wherever we wanted, have lunch, walk, visit shops, etc.  We did a great deal of talking...Those were some of the best years of my life - me as a young woman and having my Mom with me to travel and enjoy life.  She lived in LA - I in SF - so we'd go up the coast for a couple of days then she'd fly home.  We did this for 20 years...one of the best memories I'll treasure for the rest of my life...<br>  <br>  How lucky you are, that you have time to repair this relationship...how very lucky.  Because my dear, you don't want to leave this earth, or have her leave - without giving it a worthy chance.  This is I know to be fact.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|5273acbce6cb0af7de5c86b9a0097a92aa	maybe you can write down things you remember you did together in your childhood, like these significant moments, you know, and hand it to her!|`|2KC467tFaa	You could take her to a ballet or a nice play.|`|vYeS5mYnaa	yes! dont ask us, ask your mom what she wants.|`|0udjgaoBaa	What does your mom like to do? Maybe you guys could go to a spa together.|`|vvQBkzCtaa	dig up some Old pictures and make a scrap book sit back and go through them with her and remember the good times you did have . go for a walk if it is nice ,let her know how Special she is to you , and that you want a better relationship with her and you want to start with a clean slate now,the best gift you probably can give her is love ,and appreciation, and a good hug and a kiss on the cheek.all moms want to feel as if they did right by their children, and to know that they are still needed ,coming from a mom of six children . good luck. letters are always heart warming and she can reread them anytime to feel that warming feeling it gave her when she received it .
ee5MawLdaa	You want what you want. . . anyone heard of "Freedom of Speech" ?|`|idKfxUTkaa	Well that is how you are. There is nothing bad about it, I mean if you look at them and see they are hot, but they are like a ***. Then yea it could be bad for you. Swallow is weird way to say it, you just like hot guys. Your a Girl, and that's what girls do, well some girls. Just don't go out with an ***.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Women want their guy to have money too (in addition to looks).  So you want more than we do.  It is hard to hit the gym if you send all of your time trying to get rich too.|`|FMwckpMbaa	It's not shallow.<br>  You have to be attracted to someone in order to be with them.<br>  How else could you imagine being sexual with them?<br>  <br>  If in shape men is your thing, then go for it.<br>  <br>  I personally don't like guys to be that buff- but that is because that's what i prefer :)<br>  <br>  It's only shallow when you are with someone because of their looks only.<br>  It's not like only unattractive people deserve to be loved.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	First stop telling people that you are only interested in attractive people.  Second I don't think the double standard is OK so it is the people that you are talking to than think it is OK.  There is nothing wrong with being interested in people who are healthy and groom.  Personally I feel any obsession, food included is very boring.|`|td6WXhv4aa	You are not shallow there's nothing wrong with wanting to date someone you find physically attractive as long as your not being superficial about it and only like a guy because of his looks and don't care about other important things like his character and his heart.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	you might be right.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I feel exactly the same as you. Men are always looking out for a beautiful woman, and only settle for the plainer ones when they finally realise that they will never get what they want. I agree, the unattractive men still expect to be able to have their choice of women like they're hot studs or something. And you're right, we're shallow if we don't take an interest in them.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	It's a double standard. Think about all the tv shows that have the fat sometimes ugly husband and the pretty thin with theme, According to Jim, Still Standing, and King of Queens to name a few. Think about how men who sleep around are 'cool' but women who do it are sluts.<br>  <br>  I say go ahead and continue dating your sexy guy and don't worry about what anyone says. Anyone who calls you shallow is just insecure.|`|AA10266072	I think for both men and women it's only shallow if you talk about it.  Everybody wants someone who is good looking.  Nobody wants to date a "bucket of yuck."  The only thing is that if you talk about it, you sound shallow.|`|8q5SeYueaa	I believe if a person is shallow enough to want a good looking woman, he should not be a hypocrite when she rejects his ugly *** by calling her shallow.|`|JCdBSULraa	A woman's shallow if that's ALL she cares about.  So is a guy.   But I don't think either one is shallow if they just want that in addition to other more important things.|`|GfCRiueRaa	Hmm, you may be right... I might be going out on a limb here, but maybe it's because there are more good looking women than good looking men. Gotta cut us some slack, you know? hahaha.|`|d8yrvK4waa	It's okay both ways... <br>  <br>  SteveC|`|6e7898d5f2786d5d819edd5e8050845faa	Well call me Miss. Shallow|`|AA11803994	First of all, there is nothing wrong with wanting to be attracted to the man you want to date or marry....who wouldn't! That doesn't mean you are shallow. It means that you are looking for a man with similar interests in taking care of his body and his health.<br>  <br>  HOW you express this opinion may lead people to believe you are shallow!<br>  See example:<br>  There is a big difference between saying, "I am really attracted to men who take care of themselves by staying in shape and eating healthy" and "I can't imagine being married to anyone who doesn't look as hot as The Rock!" See the difference?<br>  <br>  If you are the kind of person who takes care of how you look and your health and you want someone who shares the same interest, there is nothing wrong with that. If you loved jogging and eating salads WHY IN THE WORLD would you say..."I'd love a man who hates health food, likes to sit on the couch and watch tv and hates any kind of exercise!" (unless you really do want someone like that - that is totally fine ;) )<br>  <br>  One other issue I'll bring up (and this may not be you at all) is if you don't take care of yourself and don't work out and then you are saying to people "I want a really hot man!"...Then I would say you are pretty shallow, too...lol<br>  <br>  I am not sure if someone called you shallow but next time they do tell them they need to go examine their own expectations because there is nothing wrong with yours. ;)|`|DozD8lTGaa	Erm, i would say that is shallow... either man or woman BUT, i say it myself :| so, i really cannot talk loool! i just like someone with nice looks, personality, body... and i hate it if they have a great personality and not the nicest looks (i call myself shallow) because, i shouldn't be so fussy.<br>  <br>  but, if they have a great personality then i usually go for them. so, i suppose i am not that fussy :)<br>  <br>  you never really get the 'dream' boy... and the nicest looking boys never seem to have the greatest personality (that's not all though) x<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and to 'Sexy Homer is Back' - i aint a money grabber. i would rather earn my own money, instead of expecting a man to pay it for me!!|`|YrMRlWzyaa	lol I think looks usually cloud everything that's important when it comes to dating. A good looking guy, dark hair, a chiseled jaw and brown eyes could be a rapist in his free time but a chubby guy could be the funniest or sweetest guy you've ever met. Having said that I don't think it's shallow of you have a preference, I just think sometimes by being that way you miss out on what you really want once you get past the looks. :D|`|oPy0n9nGaa	We all have an ideal as to what we are looking for.You have that right to be picky .I too only date small women with a nice figure.It shows me that they care about what they look like.They are happy go lucky women and I like someone like that.I keep myself in shape cause,I know that many women don't like a man with a big gut.|`|6CPFRnGraa	Welcome to humanity dear, people are hypocritical. I think it's quite dumb that girls are affected more by things like that than guys are. It really irks me. It's just fine to want a good looking guy. Don't listen to all those people. They are the shallow ones for not treating people equally. You aren't shallow. You're normal.|`|srNze5uIaa	I was wondering the same thing.<br>  Why women are prostitutes, but not the men who pay for them?<br>  why the women who lay the first night are seen as easy, but not the men they do it with.<br>  <br>  Double standards. A lot of things are ok for men, but not for women.|`|qegWdsNLaa	People call men shallow who say the same thing.  There was a thread here just today about a guy who didn't want to date a woman because he "didn't like her figure," and there were a trillion responses telling him that he's shallow.|`|Jd91RxNKaa	That's just the pure sport of the game. You want wat you can't have and but can get wat you don't want, lol|`|haWw3B8aaa	Date who you want.<br>  If you dated a fat rich guy then poor "in shape " guys would complain.<br>  There's always gonna be someone complaining.|`|DYBh8bo8aa	um that u are  ?um weird and i would do the same lol!!!!!!!!!|`|k7YMROOBaa	evryone thinks that but saying it is rude and hurts people its like you are saying they are not good enough|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Guys are shallow too .. but there is a double standard dont you know..
0ujpiBTCaa	Yikes. The answer she wants is "yes I own my own home"!<br>  <br>  Better put that delicately. If you are over age 19 most women will be pretty turned off by it...I would emphasize the fact that you are helping your parents, because saying it's cheaper to live with mommy and daddy is not gonna fly!<br>  <br>  Even if you didn't own, renting a place on your own is better than nothing. I couldn't have a relationship with someone who lived with their parents, haven't done that since I was 17.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I would say that "I don't think we're at that point for that discussion".|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	Having your own home and living as a self sufficient independent young adult is a big plus in terms of how women see you. If you live at home with your parents... very bad, you're a moma's boy and will not stand up for your girl friend/spouse in case of any disagreement with your parents.<br>  <br>  (Being practical, ie... saving money and living at home helping your folks, definitely does not impress the girls.)|`|AA10928214	Well, why would she want to know that unless she wants to know if you have money and assets. Also, I think normally you're parents are supposed to move into you're house and you take care of them if need be... not you go live with mommy.. but whatever you need to do.|`|71EwzPSlaa	whoa! good question lol...id say ya but the big thing is if you go to close the deal you gotta go to there place ...would be way weird if you took a chick home and she saw your parents lol not a good idea|`|km0F8AR6aa	Honesty is the best policy!|`|01kEv36Faa	Well apparantly you are uncomfortable with your living arrangement, even though you have justified living with your parents.  But it's a normal question to ask when getting to know someone.  It can tell alot about a person.  I would suggest to try and be more self confident about your choice of where you live.  You don't have to rationalize it to anyone else but your self.  Keep in mind however that there is the risk of a woman thinking you lack independence or motivation if you say its to not pay rent.  <br>  Or if you subconsciously feel that you should be living in your own home, rent something near your parents.  Spending money on rent is part of being a grown up<br>  You can always imply that your parents live with you and not the other way around.  Though not totally honest, its not really anyones business on a first or second date.
gPU1kUXbaa	you know how when you bang your elbow, and for a slight moment, around a couple of seconds your just like 'ahh holy crap!'<br>  then theres abit of after pain..<br>  well its like that(:<br>  lmao how bad was that explanation?<br>  umm i'm not sure, its not as sore as people make it out to be..<br>  <br>  x|`|gTfNdFAzaa	actually it didn't hurt. i was always told that sex for the first time hurts, but for me it didn't. i guess it just depends on the person you're having sex with. if they go slow and are gentle with you it wont hurt. for example, my husband was real gentle with me, therefor it didn't hurt.|`|2lx4cgYPaa	Ive heard it compared to like an ear piercing.

Just keep ur clothes on and make out or something.  It hurts like . . . well, more then I can compare it to anything else. <br>  BUT if u do do it (lol dodo <---- long story) make sure it is with the right guy...|`|EFlX4GYOaa	I haven't gotten over the emotional pain and it has been nearly 20 years.|`|0udjgaoBaa	It hurt like an ear piercing to me..and then I went numb down there. It was weird I didnt do it again for like 6 months after that.|`|AA10958272	If you're in love, and the guy is man that knows what he's doing -- and you're mentally prepared to give yourself & take the consequences (its done for making babies, you know). Then, there is no pain. It's simply a feeling you've never had, in the arms of the right and real man. It hurts, even years & years after your 1st time -- if the guy is just using you for exercise or a conquest. (That will happen, if you take this all lightly.)|`|i9MKTn26aa	I had zero pain the first time. I was ready. The less tense you are the better it will be.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	The first time was just a little uncomfortable, not painful. Make sure you are really ready and please use a condom!!!|`|Khs7HBYmaa	IF YOU EVER HAD A PAP YOU KNOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THAT IS. FOR ME IT WAS LIKE THAT. BUT I DIDNT HURT FOR LONG.|`|939486fd47e1ca3cefbbae1d7440046daa	Please this is the kind of stuff that should have been censored|`|LU7WB6Poaa	I didn't have any pain whatsoever when I had sex for the first time.|`|FQxUpc9baa	real bad cramps|`|B9fwuaSlaa	It's almost like a good pain honestly. It didn't hurt me that much.
0q5Z5zxIaa	i would say that she does like you. she's just being very shy with you and isn't sure if you like her too. i'd say that if you want her, you should start flirting with her so that she has a feeling that you like her. that way you two will start to talk more and your friendship will start to grow. everything will happen in time!<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|jsgKGtdBaa	I'm sorry...<br>  <br>  you must have mistaken us for people who cared.<br>  <br>  <br>  (P.S no one will reply seriously when you write a wall of text. Better luck next time.)
ee5MawLdaa	People cheat for all kinds of dumb reasons. Sometimes it revenge other times they just fall into temptation. Dont worry man, just be yourself. If the girl doesnt like you for who you are then she isnt worth ur time. :)|`|hoGpOrOUaa	erm... the fact that you just assume if you had a girlfriend she'd cheat and that you wouldn't blame them sounds like you have some confidence issues!<br>  <br>  personally, i don't cheat and you date someone for their personality not cheat on them because of it!|`|gf7vJTjBaa	no i would not cheat, because if i really care about my boyfriend then there is no way i would. and i think about every girl is like that.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	No!!!

Even if I was dating him for other reasons I would still not cheat on him.|`|Khs7HBYmaa	IT DOESNT DEPEND ON YOU IF A GIRL CHEATS ON YOU.

A further charge is likely to bemade by the owners of the building for the use of the premises. <br>  <br>  Cost of religious ceremony in the Church of England or Church in Wales – check fees with the vicar of the church in which you are planning to marry. <br>  <br>  Cost of religious ceremony at a building other than Church of England or Church in Wales - Unless the building has an Authorised Person, there will be a ￡40.00 fee for the Registrar and there may be further fees charged by the trustees of the building and the person who performs the ceremony. <br>  <br>  Cost of marriage certificate: ￡3.50|`|aGDdC82taa	i paid $500 for the church in Lima Peru|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I'm sure every church can be different, but mine is costing $550 in the US.
37M3dkkRaa	i'll tell you how this is with me... this one girl called my bf's brother to get his phone number about a year and a half ago, and she called his phone and he straight up told me about it so i called her back and told her he's mine, back off. well 6 months later she goes to his brothers house looking for him because she didn't know that he had moved in with me even though he lived here the first time when she called and i told her not to be messin with him cuz i already told her once to leave him alone and i told her if she done it again she'd have serious problems...well that got rid of that girl. then we went to one of his friends daughter's birthday party and his friends sister in law kept staring at him and like trying to flirt with him, and she started drinking alcohol to try to impress him or somethin, so i done the same thing...stupid b*tch couldn't even get one shot down, how's that gonna impress anyone? its not...then she tried doing it again at a bonfire and i told her to leave him the f*** alone or her face would be in the fire...so she backed off...<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm not jealous about it, but it pisses me off because i have to steadily repeat myself and i get tired of it, you don't mess with what's mine, it just takes a while for some girls to understand...so go ahead and find her and tell her to back off.<br>  <br>  <br>  *sorry the answer is so long*|`|htWw0OlCaa	I wouldn't be worried or flattered, I would be pissed.......|`|4tDTQOgNaa	At times it's good to feel flattered if a particular person or persons feels that your boyfriend is attracted but in this situation I would feel very concerned.

She's just going to get what she wants by any means necessary.

17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	Firstly, get yourself a back bone and don't be frightened to stand up against this girl. If she's your best friend then you should be able to say what you like to her and she will listen. Friends respect each other and accept criticism. <br>  <br>  Secondly, your friend should not be having sex at 14 years old, she's underage and risks pregnancy and STI's. So you're right, it isn't funny. <br>  <br>  Your best friend sounds like a show off and likes putting others down in front of others to embarrass them. Tell her to stop it and grow up.|`|9qVQNN7qaa	Laugh and say " hun.. that's getting old now... leave the girl alone.....

They can tell you don't love or even like them if you cheat, get drunk, take drugs, ignore them, go out with your friends and forget about them at home, put too many things before them, are tight with money, too controlling, disloyal, don't defend or protect them, lie, etc.|`|YzgCab38aa	nohow. They will never tell you because then you will stop putting<br>   out, paying the bills, cooking and cleaning. And they love nothing<br>   but their own tender selves. They can be with anybody, provided they<br>   just like the girl/woman. They use her, if something better comes<br>   along, they move on and like the other one, if not, they stay with<br>   the one they already like.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Your going to marry him not them. Don't worry about it. You don't want to go through life wondering "what if" if you broke up with him. Eventually they will accept him.|`|EFhhbS7Eaa	ask them why they feel this way... your family is always there to guide you <br>  <br>  kk|`|7i0r7DZoaa	You should sit them all down, and tell them that you love him so much, and if they don't know already tell them that you are pregnant. Tell them that they have not had enough time to get to know him,and they might find out what a nice, considerate person he is. (My mum and my dad's family didn't get along, but even though one lives in america and the other in England, they get along now!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps, good luck with the new arrival!
LBW8Rv35aa	Have you talked to your girl about it? That may be the best way to get the friend to back off a little bit. I imagine she (and your girl) might get a bit defensive if you say something to her, but if it comes from her friend (your girl) it might be taken better. If you have told your girl that this is bothering you and she has ignored it, maybe that's a clue as to how she defines this relationship. You're all just good buddies who hang out together. Have another talk with her so she understands how serious this is and how much it bothers you. Be calm, not threatening, but tell her you may need to just end it and move on if she can't respect your feelings and devote a little quality time to you.
foqCXKR3aa	Pros: <br>  Guy will want to be with you, girls will want to be like you.<br>  You could get into modeling if you wanted to.<br>  You won't have to try hard to look stunning like others do/need less make up.<br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  People might think of you stereotypically and think you are just a pretty face.<br>  Might get tired of being constantly hit on and having to reject al ot of guys.<br>  Might be hard to find true love as guys might not love you for who you are inside, but just what's on the outside.<br>  <br>  Just to name a few, but of course, overall what girl would choose not to be a sexy girl given the chance?|`|njWh5Kobaa	Being really attractive your going to get ALL the guys. And some people may dislike you for it.

It could also be that deep down he has a crush on you, guys tend to be dicks and be nasty when they like you at a young age because they can grow the balls to tell you they like you in a nice way.  dont stress sweetheart, hes just being an idiot|`|qroOTyrGaa	It depends, if your friend told you that then she shouldn't be telling you horrible things that her boyfriend said. Those are pretty hurtful things to have to tell your friend. But no matter what he says you know better.

ghbaAWOCaa	a dead convo on the phone...doesnt seem like a very good start. Normally it just happens...phone conversations dont end and you hve noe diea what youve been talking about. In the beginning cors its weird but a bit later it gets ok.until you reach a point your talking so much about absolutely nothng!<br>  <br>  How long ago did you start talkin to her on the phone?|`|UADLdXBtaa	I'm kind of the same way. Talking online is easier because you have time to think about what you want to say or you can multitask while you are talking to someone. Being on the phone is so immediate it's like you HAVE to say something or you might as well hang up. Online it's okay if you can't think of anything for a minute and you aren't rushed so things come easier. You can both be doing other things like listening to music or reading news or watching tv or whatever and it doesn't seem like the conversation is lacking. Maybe you should just stick to IM.|`|gxYXIpxKaa	Just tell her that you don’t know what to say…that you just wanna talk to her forever but don’t know what about…where to start.|`|0RI3LDX4aa	talk about stuff you have in common or even stuff about her, like so how's it going over there. girls love to talk about themselves. keep the conversation going ask questions but not too much. act like your on the computer and maybe even write down what you are going to say. hope it helps!|`|uCCyOYZ8aa	you're both nervous|`|pfUwosyDaa	ok well maybe it is just easier to say what you need with your fingers and in your head than to say them outloud... that could be also when you are on the computer no one else can hear it is just between you and her... so it isn't that yall are nervous it is just that it is like a special bond that yall share and want it to stay that way..try starting out saying what you are typing or even texting.. out loud to your self as you do it and maybe that will help with being able to talk on the phone more... just try it and see... an hang in there it wont be silent and akward for long..|`|iVNAuo88aa	same with me. you get lost on the phone cuz u dont no what to say but on the comp you have a lot to say. soo when its silent just say heyy hows your family or just ask her about her life

sXMGc90vaa	Get away from him. I know it's difficult, you seemed to be attached to him, but from what you told, I don't think he cares about you. It's gonna sound awful, but it looks like you're his "backup" for when he's lonely.<br>  It doesn't matter if he's nice to you when you're together: You deserve much better!! And you have to convince yourself of that, so you can leave him.|`|62TvIinPaa	It seems... He is confused. Talk to him face to face. I think he is worried about your relation's(if exists/ if to be made) future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|g2DaHVMmaa	dont waste your time w him.<br>  let him come to you when hes ready but dont be vonurable.

I mustve added the wrong Tom, sorry." and thatll be less embarrasing!|`|n5gfZqe4aa	You could go to the Wall Mart, and bumb into him or something by accident, start talking to him and then add him on Facebook when you get home.<br>  <br>  If he asks just say you recognised him from a friends account and call it fate.|`|ODgT8zgvaa	Hum well Im a very outgoing person so I wouldnt be able to go to long without telling him. I think the Facebook idea sounds okay. Stop by Wal-Mart a few more times. Don't be afraid to be who you are. Just be yourself and if he cant except that uh then he isnt worth it. I hope he turns out to be everything you are hoping for. Just don't fall to hard before actually knowing him personally. Guys might be all nice and goodlooking on the outside. But a completly different person on the inside.

1Mc6BOvKaa	I haven't had personal experience, but I am a Royal Mail employee and I used to work in the International Section.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, Royal Mail will handle human ashes, but only if wrapped very securely. This is essential for your own piece of mind also. <br>  Also ensure all paperwork is in order - you'll probably have to fill out a Customs Declaration (which you can label the contents as "human ashes") and make sure you put on a return address, just in case it can't be delivered to Australia for whatever reason (the Australian Post Office or Customs seems the most likely reason if this occurs).<br>  <br>  According to Australia Post's website ( <a href="http://www.auspost.com/internationalpost/information/prohibited_goods/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.auspost.com/internationalpost...</a> ), they'll handle buman ashes, just not in their express courier service. This shouldn't be a problem, as you will be using a Royal Mail service that Australia Post completes. You may like to use Royal Mail "International Signed For" just for extra piece of mind. The ashes may be too big for the "Airsure" service.
76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you're right, it's very tacky.  just on principle, I wouldn't get them a thing.  I'm going to do the same if it happens to me in the future, but to date no one I know has been gauche enough to come out and ask for cash for their wedding.  they should have put 'in lieu of gifts, please make a donation'.  THAT's what you should do!  give them a card and inside write a note that you made a donation in their name!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	*Asking* for a gift is always tacky. <br>  <br>  If you inquire what a couple wants as a gift, the answer can be "cash", and that's fine (you asked, they answered).|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Are they asking for cash for their shower or wedding?<br>  <br>  European tradition usually is you give a gift (from where the bride is registered) for the shower and usually you bring an envelope (money)as a wedding gift. That is understood so it is never been asked in writing on the invitations. <br>  <br>  I wouold stick to what you are comfortabel giving. If you have a gift that you know they will like and appreciate then give them that. Just becasue they asked everyone for cash doesn't mean everyone has to bring cash!|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I think it's rude to put that on an invitation. I would prefer money for my wedding as well, but I'm certainly not going to print that anywhere! I wouldn't feel right about it at all. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd go ahead and buy them something that's within your budget, OR a small cash gift that you can afford.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No it is not accepted nowadays and is rude and improper. Those people have no regard whatsoever for proper manners and they don't care who they insult in the process. There are plenty of folks who still know what proper manners are but they seem to be a vast minority on the boards here. It's not just cash gifts that the majority here deems to be appropriate and accepted when it is not in reality. There is a plethora of rude behavior that these same people say is acceptable which is not. <br>  <br>  They also don't seem to realize or care that the entire globe is in a recession and money just doesn't grow on trees.|`|zSABr7praa	We got a lot of money from our families for our wedding, primarily because we are a military family and the first year of our marriage was going to spent between 3 states while my husband was in training.  Dishes, furniture, and appliances really didn't work for us because we'd just have to store it anyways, as we'd be staying in furnished places.  I would NEVER, EVER ask for money as a gift.. registered at target and specifically did not register for anything over $50 because we felt it was presumptuous that someone would pay that.  It is VERY tacky.  A friend of mine recently put where they were registered on their "save the date" and my husband let her know how tacky he thought THAT was, I can't imagine getting something asking for money as a gift in the mail.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	that is totally wrong.... the wedding etiquette book says to never ask for gifts or money or include any o that info in your invites....<br>  <br>  maybe they didn't know..but usually when you get an invite you ask them if they are register...if they say they didn't register then you kinda assume they prefer money or you can get them something else..that is totally up to YOU...you can not invite people and tell them what to get you...you are not even obligated to get  them something from the registry/...that was just created for people that have no idea what to get..so they can use this as a guide..<br>  <br>  you should call them and ask them if they registered somewhere...and see what their answer is..|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I think it is disgusting!<br>  My fiance & I both owned our own homes, have combined our things, had alot of duplicates that were donated or given away and we still managed to find things we wanted and could use to put on our wedding registry.<br>  I think people are full of it if they claim they "have everything we need" but want to ask for cash.  If you truly don't need anything then you don't even need cash and your invite should have a nice line to say "no gifts please" instead of trying to reference gifts of cash.|`|sGP6s7uraa	On my registry there is an option to give a gift card but NEVER had I even dreamed of asking my guest for cash.  Cash is crass (that's the word of the week LOL).<br>  <br>  I think it's disrespectful, haughty and selfish to ask for cash.  If you can't get married on your own funding, then you need to reprioritize this lavish wedding your planning, ya know?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	This is how it has ALWAYS been. It's tradition to give gifts or money. So these people are rich and expect the best-not the nicest thing but you can at least give $100.00 and best wishes. If they don't like it, that's their fault.<br>  <br>  Well, it's slightly rude-they should be happy with what they get.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Gifts should never be mentioned in an invite period.  Especially when your guests are forking over money to go to a destination wedding!|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	while it's tacky IMHO it's getting to be quite the norm. people are registering for their mortgages, bank accounts honeymoons, photographers -- you name it!!!|`|QmG2v1quaa	If you hate the idea of couples telling you what they want for their wedding then you must be completely against bridal registrys?!?!<br>  <br>  I mean, really, what is the difference? So the couple already has everything they need. What's wrong with asking for cash? It would be like asking for thousands of dollars in formal china, or flat screen tvs, or a playstation 3. There is no difference!!<br>  <br>  If you're worried about the amount of money you can give them, well I'm sure they will appreciate any amount. I mean I'm sure they realize that not everyone is going to spend 100 dollars on them. That's why there are things like spatulas on bridal registrys. To give guests options as to what they want to spend. <br>  <br>  I really don't see what everyone is getting so pissed about!!|`|R7b150Iyaa	I think ASKING for money is horrible.  If someone asks where a couple is registered, you can say "we are not registered'" and they'll get the hint to give you money for your wedding.  However, in a lot of cultures (Jewish, Italian, Russian, Albanian and more) giving money on the wedding day is the completely accepted norm.  I live right outside of NYC, which is a largely Jewish and Italian-populated area, and never hear of anyone giving gifts for a wedding, it is always envelopes of money.  Money is always a lot more useful than a gift that can be exchanged or returned.  My wedding is April 17th, and I heard that even my grandparents are planning on giving us money (we have never mentioned wanting money or anything though).<br>  <br>  So to answer your question: giving money at weddings is perfectly acceptable, but ASKING for it is not.  If you feel that a gift would better express your congratulations to the couple, then by all means, get them a nice gift.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5qwW4GGAaa	im getting married in june and my family knows we have a very tiny budget so when they asked what we wanted as gifts or if people asked we said just house hold things for starting out on your own but if they couldnt decide money would help. but i would never dream of directly asking for money straight out on the invites|`|IuP0ryOMaa	Usually that means the couple is pretty much set on items they need for a happy life together, but dont have any money for a honeymoon, or a down payment on a house, or something like that.  <br>  <br>  I am sure they will graciously receive any gift given though.|`|eiYVlVNNaa	This isn't about them getting married its about people paying for their dream party, personally I wouldn't go and wouldn't bother responding either.|`|8g51eBf1aa	I totally agree. It's not even proper etiquette or anything. It's just rude and tacky!|`|b8bc0df3b725314ceaeaf729c6afe856aa	they can go as far as ask for 50.00 min?? for that they get the envelope with monopoly money please what people can afford or just don't invite them!!|`|f2RpmfFOaa	we never asked for anything from anyone and got more than we ever expected|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I think a lot of people have just come to expect a lot more from their wedding... and they've become a lot bolder in asking for it.  I don't agree with it at all... although I'm getting married in a few months, I wont' be upset if I don't get gifts from everyone or if they want to buy off the registry.  We are doing a registry-  I know that some people think that registries are bad taste, but we are inviting over 300 people!  If I don't give them some ideas of what we want, we will end up with 100 toasters, 100 engraved picture frames and 100... who knows what!  Some people really enjoy getting the couple something that they want and know that they will use.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, back to the asking for money thing.. totally tacky.

Cutting — using a sharp object to cut your own skin on purpose until it bleeds — is a form of self-injury. Guys sometimes self-injure by burning their skin with the lit end of a cigarette, a lighter, or a match. Their skin won't show cut marks, but it might show the small, round scars of a burn.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people turn to this behavior when they have problems or painful feelings and haven't found another way to cope or get relief.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, people who cut themselves don't talk about it or let others know they’re doing it. But sometimes they confide in a friend. Sometimes a friend might find out in another way.<br>  <br>  It can be upsetting to learn that a friend has been cutting. You might feel confused or scared. You may feel sad or sorry that your friend is hurting herself in this way. You might even be mad — or feel like your friend has been hiding something from you. You might wonder what to say, whether to say anything at all, or if there is anything you can do to help a friend who cuts.<br>  <br>  It can help you to know more about cutting, why some people do it, and how they can stop. Sharing this information with your friend can be a caring act, and it might help her or him take the first step toward healing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ways to Help<br>  Understanding why a friend may be cutting can help you be supportive. But what can you actually do to help your friend stop?<br>  <br>  The first thing is to be realistic about what you can achieve: As with any damaging behavior (such as alcoholism, drugs, or eating disorders), some people just may not be ready to acknowledge the problem and stop. So don't put too much pressure on yourself — your friend's problem could be a longstanding one that requires help from a professional therapist or counselor. Therapists who specialize in treating adolescents often are experienced in working with people who self-injure and can also help with other issues or emotional pain they might have.<br>  <br>  Here are some things that you can try to help a friend who cuts:<br>  <br>  Talk about it. You've asked your friend about the cuts and scratches — and maybe he or she changed the subject. Try again. Let your friend know that you won't judge and that you want to help if you can. If your friend still won't talk about it, just let him or her know the offer stands and you are open to talking anytime. Sometimes it helps to let a friend know that you care. Still, even though you do your best, your friend might not want to talk. <br>  Tell someone. If your friend asks you to keep the cutting a secret, say that you aren't sure you can because you care. Tell your friend that he or she deserves to feel better. Then tell an adult in a position to help, like your parents, a school psychologist or counselor, or a teacher or coach your friend is close to. Getting treatment may help your friend overcome the problem. Your friend may be mad at you at first. But studies show that 90% of those who self-injure are able to stop within a year of beginning treatment. <br>  <br>  Help your friend find resources. Try to help your friend find someone to talk to and a place to get treatment. There are also some good books and online support groups for teens who self-injure. Be careful, though: Although some websites offer useful suggestions about how to resist the urge to cut, the stories or pictures some people send in may actually trigger the urge to cut in those who read or see them. And some sites promote a sense of sisterhood or solidarity that might interfere with a person's getting help. There's nothing cool about cutting — beware of people or websites that suggest there is! <br>  Help your friend find alternatives to cutting. Some people find that the urge to self-injure passes if they squeeze an ice cube in their hand really hard, draw with a red marker on the body part they feel like cutting, take a walk with a friend (you!), rip up old newspapers, stroke their cat or dog, play loud music and dance, or find another distraction or outlet for their feelings. These strategies don't take the place of getting professional counseling, but they can help in the short run. For more ideas, click here. <br>  Acknowledge your friend's pain. Let friends who cut know that you get what they're going through by saying things like, "Your feelings must just overwhelm you sometimes. You've been through a lot — no wonder you hurt. I want to help you find a way to cope that won't hurt you anymore." Try to avoid statements that send the message you don't take your friend's pain seriously (such as "But you've got such a great life" or "Things aren't that bad," which can feel dismissive to a person who cuts). <br>  Be a good role model. Everyone experiences painful emotions like hurt, anger, loss, disappointment, guilt, or sadness. These emotions are part of being human. Coping with strong emotions — instead of dwelling on them and continuing to feel bad — involves a few key|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I don't pay any attention because that's what they seem to want.|`|HlOmfQBQaa	yeah, she is<br>  <br>  why dont u tell her you've had problems with it and ask her for help about it, maybe then she'll open up

urkNRr5Kaa	Well, from a guy's perspective it is something that I know I look forward to doing when I find the right girl, and I've thought it about since I was young about which way I would do it.  <br>  <br>  With that said, I think if you want to marry him you should do it.  There is no reason he has to do it, but maybe you could casually bring it up or see if him popping the question is important.  <br>  <br>  But, all that to say is that if you really love him and want to get married then by all means do it!!|`|OUkaCb5Waa	No, he should ask you.

AA11234058	Well, I can relate to this. I used to be in a similar situation. The home school thing, omg where do I begin. Home schooling is probably the worse thing for kids. It desocializes kids because they won't have to deal with everyday society. Not trying to be offensive or anything but I do not like people who home school their kids. I used to be in hs for about 4 years. And I hated every minute of it. You may want to ask your parents if you can go to regular school. <br>      Next is the christianity. Unfortunately, most of them are hypocrites. ESPECIALLY in the south. One of the reasons why I am the way I am. <br>     Now, how to deal with your family. This is a tough one because it's hard to deal with some1 like that when you are with them all the time. I would suggest going to a friend's house. Or better yet, go for a walk when the situation gets heated. Remember that no matter what happens, you have to be the bigger person.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	They may have no idea how you feel and what they do.

Remember when you have a family don't make the same mistakes they supposedly have.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  Talk to your counsellor at school that is what they are there for.<br>  Speak to your parents about them fighting all the time and it is affecting you.  Ask them to see a minister or better yet go and see a minister yourself.  I don't know where you live but in Canada their is student welfare and the government will place you in some other home.<br>  Your school should know about this.  Its time people start making an effort to get along as life is way to short.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	That is life, you sound really immature and uneducated though-so you will probably living w your parents for a very long time.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Stay away as much as possible|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Thats a tough situation. Try talking to them about how you feel. Be calm and non-confrontational, but honest. You may want to write drown what you would like to say so you can keep it straight. Some things you might want to consider: Is there another relative you might be able to live with for awhile? Perhaps you should ask to go to real school for a bit? Or at least get involved in outside activities, like sports or a drama club? If it's really so bad that you feel you are being abused, call child protective services, they will send someone over to check on the compliant and if they feel it is valid they will remove you and your brothers from the home.|`|ylg9ejceaa	We can not choose our families. Instead of making the situation worse and feeling miserable all the time. You need to emcrace them. Find things that you do love about them. I am sure theres SOMETHING good in them.. after all.. they did create YOU! Try to talk to your mom or dad (or both) about the fighting. Let them know that you are getting older and you'd appreciate the respect if they kept that more private or found better ways to communicate with each other. Maybe they can fight in there room with the door shut. The reality is, all couples fight. Times are tough right now and they are probably stressed. The only problem is they are allowing it to effect there kids. Try asking them to wait until you are asleep or suggest they go out together (alone) to discuss there issues. You could also offer to help. Ask if there is anything you can do for your parents to take some strain off there back. It could be the littlest thing. My 9 year old son asked me what he can do to help me around the house. And although there wasnt any one particular thing he could do at that moment, him coming to me and asking me that showed he cared, and that he noticed how much I truely do for our house hold. Your parents will respect you more if you come at them as a mature young woman. Try being thankful for having a 2 parent home. There are MANY MANY kids who would die for that. You may not realize it now, but you are very blessed. Try to make the most of it, and get what you can from them, as far as gaining knowlege. Take notice of there interactions and communicaion (or lack there of), and try to apply it to yourself and think of ways you would handle the situation differently. As you grow into an adult those tools will become valuable and make you a stronger woman in the end.<br>  As for the no friends thing, for starters.. you are calling yourself "weird'! You need to build your self esteem and dont worry if you are or are not "weird". Just be you and love yourself. People will be more attrackted towards you if you are pertraining a more confident role. Don't worry to much either. Being a teen ager is hard, for everyone. You are not weird and you are not alone in this! Just try to figure out who you are as a person and love yourself and be proud of where/who you came from. In time it will make you into who you are destin to be.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	First you said you do not have friends, then you go on to talk about how your parents act around them.  Do you have friends or not? <br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do really, just try to make the best of it.  <br>  Compared to ALOT of people you have a great life.  You have food and shelter... it may not be ideal.  But it could be a lot worse.  You just have to take one day at a time, start working and saving your money so when you can move out, you will be ready.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	Unfortunately the answer here is to keep your distance as often as possible, and you aren't uneducated don't listen to that person, they just have no empathy. I understand your situation but it seems that you will just have to stick this out the best that you can. If you need to talk you can email me :)|`|iVNAuo88aa	Im going through the same thing. Everyone yells and screems and you just wanna rip your head off. My older sister is obvoiusly  the perfect child cuz she does things and blames me and even when i explain to my parents that she did it they believe her and not me. I just ignore it and spend time with friends. You should go out and make more friends.|`|ep9XIeDTaa	get a job and be out of the house as much as possible. go exercise, join a youth group, find friends out of your home.|`|kSIbucMjaa	get emancipated =)|`|8ZBsR4Rpaa	try childline, 08001111|`|dD8CxaRhaa	First of all, don't act angry around them or they will like you even less.<br>  <br>  Is there any way you can go to an ordinary school? That would be better for you, as you will have more friends and you'll see your parents less since you'll be spending your day at school.<br>  When they are fighting try to get out of the house for a few hours.<br>  <br>  When they pick on you, tell them they're being unfair and unreasonable. Or if they get even angrier, ignore them.<br>  <br>  Tell someone in the family (someone you really trust) what's going on and how it bothers you. They might be able to talk to your parents.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|NSDIDr9Kaa	try and discuss your feelings with them|`|LA69leWAaa	Answering questions like this is always difficult - since your family is 'christian' have you considered talking with your pastor or priest?  With out knowing you and your family I don't think you will get real good advice this way.  Best I can say to you is that open and honest communication is the only way to start. Let them know how you feel.  If you are unable to talk to them try writing a letter.  I have raised two children, my son is now a mechanical engineer and my daughter has made some decisions/choices that have caused her difficulties. which has caused her to have a much slower start to her 'adult' life.  She's now 19, lives at home, and doesn't make enough money to get from paycheck to paycheck because of the choices she made.  We tried to keep the communication lines open but she shut down on us for a couple of years...I guess it was the "I know more than you do" stage.  She regrets the choices she made now and luckily it's not too late.  If you can't get beyond all of what makes you crazy try and figure out how you can live with it and remember the choices that you make now will effect your future.  You can not afford to mess with your education or your reputation.  Perhaps family counseling would help.  Don't give up on your family - they should always be there for you and be the best friends you can have.  Be careful what you wish for...it may come true and you will find it wasn't really what you wanted. Good luck and may the Lord keep you and your family safe, healthy and happy.
WMrNa3Doaa	Well, considering I'm bisexual,  I happen to have a very good opinion of them.  It's very irritating when people assume you aren't capable of a monogamous relationship though.  They seem to think that bisexuality means your bedroom is a revolving door of men and women.  I've had meaningful relationships with men and women, one at a time.|`|djUMvICoaa	That's an interesting question.  I like to feel that I'm O.K. with it as long as they do their own thing some place else.  Yet the thought of two women together is intriging, but when I remember that's without a guy, I get lost again.  I mean I'm sure every guy has had his fantasy of two women, but if you could only watch, well it would still be a turn on but somewhat of an ego blower if you couldn't join in ever.  Overall,it's still they don't bother me and I won't bother them.|`|dUeDmb7raa	i think the majority of them are actually straight but pretend to be bisexual so they can put that as their orientation on their myspace, all in an attempt to seek the attention that they so desperately crave<br>  <br>  <br>  if they actually were bisexual they wouldn't be flaunting it all over the internet, it would just be the way they are<br>  <br>  <br>  i bet real gays and bisexuals hate all the "trendy gays" out there|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	This is America!  We have the right to freedom of speech.  I don't think God intended for people to have sex w/the same gender.   But, like I said, we all have our own opinion, and are allowed to speak it.  That is why we live in the USA!|`|liHpJvVfaa	I think it is pretty normal because it helps you figure out what you like and want.|`|WwrCYF1kaa	Same as I think about anybody else. Just another person with their own life to live.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	I could watch bi-sexual girls for hours.|`|xZI6noJiaa	about bi's- don't really care. do what ya gotta do. If it works for ya, fine.|`|neJbYkJoaa	I think it's wrong.  Just because someone has a desire to do something does not make it right.  This society has gotten too carried away with what our "rights" are.  Just because someone prefers lemon pie over a lime pie does not mean that they are entitled to have "rights" because they have a preference for something.  Just as some people prefer to have 10 wives does not mean they have "rights " to marry 10 times, so just as a person has preference for a partner of same sex does not mean that they have a "right" to marry a person of the same sex.  Why should gay marriage be legalized and not polygamy or animal sex?  <br>  <br>  A person may not be able to help the fact that they are sexually attracted to someone, but just as having an affair is wrong so is having sex with multiple partners and partners of the same sex.|`|gC1918dJaa	girls doesnt bother me as much, idk why say im a typical guy if u want whatever but in guys thats disgusting.<br>  <br>  and i should of known u were an icp ******. **** u and everyone else who thinks they're cool because they listen to songs about killing and try to intimidate people because there's more of u then them because all of you are to ***** to fight on your own.|`|naUFdYJEaa	If they want to screw both guys and girls that's cool for them.I would never date one and that's just me.I like my men to be real men and have a preference for women.|`|n65bjVokaa	I don't agree with it, but I don't have a problem with it. If that's what people wanna do, it's a free country.|`|KSQ8y2Itaa	I hate faggots but l love lesibans.|`|NhORuqjzaa	<3 love them both <3 ya gotta and were not the confused ones you all are|`|xnULbpgqaa	gross. pick one.|`|ifUG4aEGaa	well i think that is a confusion because or you are gay or straight <br>  That's it|`|AA10873763	I'm jealous.<br>  They have twice the opportunities.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Being one, I think we're cool. I also think that anyone who says I'm confused or lying about my orientation is an asshole. Sexuality is a continuum, not a series of discrete boxes. Almost everyone is bisexual to a certain degree, even if it's such a small degree that they would never act on it. My being bisexual does not mean that I sleep with anything that moves nor does it mean I'm a manwhore, it simply means that I'd be open to dating someone of either gender.|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	I don't think there is such a thing.  A bisexual is person that goes both ways, am I right?  Here's some vital information for you:  When you are at a stop sign, is it possible to go left and right at the same time?  <br>  <br>  I don't dislike bisexuals or anything, that's just my belief.  If that make's them happy, then do what you do.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Confused.|`|pCEAIihqaa	Good for them, they get more pickings!|`|hzQDocWaaa	hmm it doesn;t bother me
37M3dkkRaa	yeah, actually. there has to be something out there that does, i just don't know what it could be?|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Not until you're starving.|`|FQxUpc9baa	no but that if u r w/ the right one  but i would say making love feels better then just sex|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Yes... Love.|`|n9HUANkiaa	not in this world|`|yb01tlviaa	love does|`|T1R6UZDOaa	Not that I can think of.  Not even food can top that.|`|KSQ8y2Itaa	Having sex with myself???|`|bySKI0ATaa	probably not
fKuvMPCiaa	You can't make someone like you. I guess you could join groups that he is in so that you'll see him more often but that's not a guarantee that he'll ever like you.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Try to be around him more often or you might email him and say that you had a good time the last time you saw him at (wherever it was) and say you wish that you could get together again.<br>  If that doesn't work have your mother tell his mother that you like him and that she would not mind if he were to date you.<br>  Good luck.|`|Plq0BGSgaa	flirt a little, girl!|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Get his number and call him. Talk to him on the phone, and if it gets any further and he likes you. He will ask you out. If guys like you they will make it happen, but if they don't they don't. Just be patient and be his friend for now. Until he is ready. Girls tend to speed things up, just go with the flow. Then after it gets more serious maybe go out with him on a date or whatever.|`|e6sJvRepaa	try to get to know him more, and when you're sure that you're really maybe then you can ask if he has a girlfriend, and if he doesn't why? and if he likes someone. if he does try to get to know more about what tipe of girl he likes|`|htpxHZTPaa	Try to flirt! lol that's the best way.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|y2nC8BUGaa	why not just tell him you like him and ask him out?|`|2281a1c4c2102f5d36cd742c8dea977faa	You cant make anyone like you. You just have to have time and see if in the end you makea love match. Id exchange emails or IMs and talk and get to know each other that way since you dont see each other that much. You already have a friendship bond it seems so it should be easy to get that. See if he has a MySpace and dont give up if hes not the guy for you. Eventually the right one does. Im 27 and just met mine.|`|SMLVM9Ysaa	Flirt with him but it has to be subtly not out there.than see if he flirts back. if he likes you he will flirt back. he will try to get close to you when you guys are next to each other and he will try or will touch you like on the arm, shoulder, play with your hair. and might even tease you. you have to remember guys are like little boys no matter what age they are.|`|9kvFuuh2aa	just tell him how you feel and maybe he either thinks of you the same, or he could consider thinking about you the same way<br>  <br>  and if it doesnt go the right way, and you're embarrassed, it won't matter because you don't see him too often.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	just try and get his number or his IM.<br>  that way, you can talk more and get to know each other better and it will be much easier for you to see if he likes you and if you like him properly.|`|wqZbkYpMaa	make a poster that says "i love you" go over to his house and show it to him. if that does not work, call his mom and tell her|`|9dvDlMdhaa	Well maybe you should continue talking to him. Invite him to go somewhere with a group of friends or by yourselves. Try talking on the phone with him too. That helps alot.|`|IZLjQUghaa	if you like him tell him.because either you tell him or someone else will.|`|ZXr1lEHLaa	Offer him a bj, he will like you for sure for that
22ojjhZhaa	Whatever you do, don't do the kissing and moving thing (unless its a peck kiss).  look her in the eye and move toward her mouth.  if she wants to kiss you she'll join in for the kiss.  then stop dancing and make out for a little bit (not too long thats just trashy).  if you're way taller than her, bend slightly but make sure to only kiss for a short time or else you'll look and feel awkward.|`|SMLVM9Ysaa	Ok. do not i repeat do not kiss her on the neck as the first kiss. that is a big no no. but make sure she wears heels that night. and when you are going in for the kiss go 90 percent  of the way. you can even go a little bit farther than 90 percent and if she wants to kiss you she will go the rest of the way.|`|n65bjVokaa	AWW...that's so sweet! I am a short girl (5'2") and most of the guys I date are like 6 ft. When my bf wanted to kiss me while we are dancing, he just does it. It's not difficult. She may be wearing heels so that might make her a bit taller. Good luck though!|`|tcGeDJtGaa	i think you should stop dancing lean in real slow take her hips lean over and get to her height and then plant one real soft|`|YQSItG06aa	As Will smith says-<br>  <br>  You go 90, she goes the other 10.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Bend down and plant your kiss on hers. IF it looks like she wants too if she gives you "the look" back off and continue dancing.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	bend your head down so that you are kind of resting on her shoulder... then kiss her neck, her cheek, and finally her lips!|`|wwRasDZLaa	Lots of possibilities depending on how much shorter she is.  Firstly, most ppl don't kiss on the mouth while dancing even if there is no height difference.  You might kiss her on the forehead or just wait til you are sitting when you peck her on the cheek.  Save the heavy mouth to mouth for when you 2 have some privacy.  You should be worrying about how to not step on her feet (don't laugh, I know a guy who stepped on a girl's toe and broke it and that ruined the prom for them).|`|PyjZVn28aa	hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...iam not too sure about kissing while you are dancing...but maybe after you can...when the song stopped.....i think doing it while dancing can make you a little dizzy and you can lose you concentration....|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	Make sure she wears a shoe with a heel, that'll help with the height situation.  Just make it smooth.  Look in her eyes and go for it.|`|imPqwNbFaa	go on u r knees and kiss her
7HSi9sQFaa	If you are going to be married to this man, you need to be able to trust him and most importantly when you feel uncomfortable about something be able to talk to him about it rationally without him making it into a fight and you apologizing just to get the fight over with. <br>  <br>  I understand that you truly care for him but the thing is, as you saw from my question that you answered, love truly does make us blind. And if something smells like a dog, barks like a dog, it probably has fleas like a dog. Take it from me and don't let your feelings for him overpower your better judgement for yourself. You deserve better than the treatment you are getting from him because it sounds to me like he's an extreme drain on your emotions right now and every girl deserves to be with a guy who appreciates all that she is and does to keep them happy and together.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Let him go and give him back his ring.  He is trying out his new lifestyle.  When and if he gets tired of it, he will come back to you.  If he doesn't, then your relationship wasn't meant to be.  It is a good thing, this is happening now and not when you were married.   Give him back his ring and tell him when he grows up, the you will re-consider it.  It will be a shock to him. but if the relationship was to be, he will come back to you.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	Well, I think that he sees all the freedom he has..<br>  Do i think shes cheating..no..but I do think he goes out....with friends..and probably acts differently than if you were there..<br>  <br>  My advice would be..if things get worse...just let him go..move on..he sounds like an @ss and i dont think any woman deserves that..|`|c2rTAk71aa	Red Flag CITY! of course he is. All guys under 21 are players. haha Cowards and PLAYERS! Move on girly. He totally is. He is just past the infatuation stage and instead is into the "pimpin it" stage.|`|DYBh8bo8aa	yes<br>  maybe hes cheating with someone at hooters maybe when he leaves u  should follow him!!!!!!!! that is ufair dont let him treat u like that|`|bn38G3QGaa	You need to find your self some girl friends and go out more often. Ur guy goes out, you should too. You both are seeing to much of each other and its going to drive you both apart. Your going to need to detach from each other and let one another breath. Have a girls night every week, go visit your family. You need to be strong on ur own. If he see's how he can do whatever he wants and ur always going to be there waiting, he will do whatever. I don't think he is cheating, but im sure as hell he's not treating you right. I was in the same boat, happy as can be when he was around. Then he would go out, never invite me, we would fight over stupid things, and id always end up saying sorry, just because i didnt want to loose him and i hated fighting. He didnt appriciate what he had and he just thought id always b there, no matter what he did... and i was....<br>  <br>  make ur self happy first. He will wanna be with u more if ur happy and going out more. Then it will mean more when u both finally get a chance to be together.<br>  <br>  I wish u all the best|`|77fe818c252176cc7d7797f0a4752e60aa	YES. But other than that, do you want to face what you're going through now after you get married to the man you seem invisible to? I don't think so.<br>  That's no way to treat the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with.<br>  Let him go. He's not worth the tears if he's gonna treat you that way.|`|ArzQb5efaa	for show he is i mean he's a jerk he basically is a drama king whta could he be doing when it seems he doesn't care about u|`|FlgTkLn0aa	YES|`|ZPRVx0Fpaa	Sounds like he doesn't care about your feelings at all. Stop calling him, see if he calls you. If he does call you, tell him you have to keep it short because you are going out. When he asks where? tell him its none of his business. Don't say sorry to him, he is being disrespectful. Do you honestly want to marry a guy who doesn't consider your feelings? He sounds selfish, and perhaps like he has lost interest. I would break it off and move on.<br>  <br>   BTW, Hooters is a place where men go to stare at womens "assets" , and bars are typically a place where singles go to hook up for a night... just keep that in mind..
LBW8Rv35aa	Sounds like this best friend is intimidated by her bestie's new friendship with you. She may be afraid of being left out somehow. Either shrug it off, or make efforts to befriend her as well. Ignoring it could escalate the problem into a you versus her situation and catch your new friend in the middle of an ugly spat. Making efforts to include her is probably the best approach. There are several ways to do this. For example, say hi to her and let her know she matters, and that you aren't trying to "steal" her best friend away. Try to include her in activities or events that you and her bestie go to.|`|zvw1tBvFaa	yeh i think so. But DON'T <br>  she should be able to have other friends<br>  she's being ridiculous <br>  dont take her away from her but dont just back off <br>  she can'ttell u who u can be friends with <br>  can she ? <br>  :)|`|T6EUvapRaa	Definitely. She doesn't want you involved.|`|ZPzeTIjIaa	Yes it is :(<br>  I had the same problem.<br>  But don't let that girl stop you from being that girl's friend. :)|`|1RElDeggaa	hmm maybe she jealous <br>  tht u r tryin to win her best frns<br>  best thin to talk to her|`|oK9WhUkiaa	i dont see anything wrong with expressing some kinda emotion towards a best friend. i have a best friend that i love to pieces. not in a sexual way lol, just as..'i love u loads as a friend' kinda way. theres nothing wrong with that. i dont understand what the big deal is here. <br>  if she's making it clear to u that she doesnt want u near her best friend then she's obviously intimidated by u and is feeling envious. she's probably worried that her best friend will replace u over her. talk to them both. dont let this girl control u tho. u are free to make friends with whoever u want. x|`|AA11899313	Maybe!  Maybe not!<br>  <br>  Maybe she just needs to talk about how / what she feels about another person.<br>  <br>  Question:  Why does it freak you out? ~ and what does 'freaking you out' mean, actually?<br>  <br>  Sash.
rQlsLZ9Baa	I'm getting married in October and I want my future husband to have the best bachelor party ever! I think the point of a bachelor party is to have every temptation. It won't be a "last tempation" because he'll have the same persuasions when he gets married. But I think women should step away and let their men have fun. If they don't trust them to behave themselves then maybe they should question if getting married is the right thing. <br>  <br>  With that said, if you don't trust that your friend will behave himself then, as a friend, you should make the call not to have his ex there. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|MQIDIOHKaa	no u TROLL :P<br>  Im sorry but NO !!<br>  :P<br>  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!<br>  That's a HORRIBLE idea !!!<br>  :P<br>  Keep AWAY from her :P|`|LU7WB6Poaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT.

dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, why didnt it work with you?  that's the issue actually.  just realize that your relationship sucked and move on.  whatever youre feeling is very normal.  im sure that his current gf worries just like you do and he probably feels the same.  when we have a past connection with someone, feelings arise.  just put it out of your mind as most people do and keep moving forward.  you dont feel that way all the time or you wouldnt be able to start a new relationship.  if he didnt have her, he'd have someone else.  just thank God that it's not you any longer, k?  :) peace|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Both. You want to make yourself believe you are over him. Sometimes it works but most of the time you get flashbacks (at the most random times) and they kill you inside. You don't want her to have him either because you want him. Maybe go out and find other guys that you really really like. Maybe he is better than the ex. Just try not to talk to him. After a while it usually ends out where you think is a jerk. That's where I am right now. Haha. Good luck.|`|htpxHZTPaa	I'm in a similar confused situation!<br>  <br>  I think you still have a little feelings for the guy. And i understand that you would be hurt by something like that...<br>  And yeah you have to say you know your jealous, i would be too.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|Plq0BGSgaa	it could be either<br>  <br>  <br>  1-you really still care and it upsets u knowing that could have been yall<br>  <br>  or <br>  2- if you cant have him you dont want anyone else to have.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  we women are crazy haha|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	You are the only one that can answer this question.|`|zmniQNRsaa	Horrible truth is if you loved someone then you can never truly be over them, this isn't to say that you cannot move on or ever love anyone else because it is just different. There will always be that feeling when you see them or hear about something like that. It is just one of those facts of life, him saying that just makes you think "well why not me?" irregardless of whether you want or wanted those things with him. Whats good though is that you have moved on, take the the hurting you feel as a good thing, it just reminds you that you are human and that you love.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|6nIXYGu6aa	Well I think your heart is split in three.  One part is to your current beu.  One is for family, and then a small little part is for your ex.  You like him a little, probably not enough to date again, but you care for his wellfair (you following?) and then he's with your enemy, you think they aren't great together.  You don't want him to get hurt.  Yet then a part of you, that still likes him thinks well maybe he still likes me too.  But sadly that is not the case.|`|iLIQIqvLaa	i think it's a little bit of both. it's a shitty situation, but you have to respect his decisions because ultimately you can't do anything about it.|`|RZr1Esi4aa	probably jealous|`|5pj6rmSraa	you dont want her to have him.|`|cvVMJQRZaa	Just let it go.|`|JwnHKTabaa	you don't want her to have him.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	u r immature<br>  get a life|`|I8va3Thlaa	I'm going through a similar situation. My ex girlfriend is now engaged to the guy she cheated on me with. We've only been broken up for 2 months now... but that's beside the point. I too was hurt when I found out. I think it's natural human emotion to be hurt when you get news like that. Even though you're over him and with somebody new, in the back of your mind you still have that little ounce of care for him. Hearing news like that makes it grow. It really gets at you, I know. Just give it a little while to sink in, you'll be fine. I promise =)|`|5fcvxZkfaa	Jewel, i think your not jealous, its the simple fact as when you heard what you heard i think you were shocked a whole lot because of the fact he never said that to you and its like he thinks shes better then you. Just stick to your partner and show him how well you could do with out him=) Then he'll think, "Wow, look at her...?". Good luck!|`|mpvjUx45aa	you still love him but your also jealous|`|nSqGHdiMaa	both you are jealous and not over him|`|0F8hauikaa	Probably just mostly jealous. I've been in a similar situation. My boyfriend and I had some issues and were "on a break". After a few weeks I found out he was interested in someone else. When I thought someone else wanted him and I might lose him forever, I sort of wanted him back. Funny how that works, human nature I guess. Of course in my case, I don't completely ever stop loving someone that I once loved, so you might still have some feelings left, too.

She probably never gave him a smack or any other type of punishment for bad behavior before either.<br>  <br>  Where is his father, if his father is alive and somewhere he should also be hauled into court and told to take control of his son.

If you want it to be small, you have to stick with that and say you just want close family and friends. It doesn't matter that they're paying for the wedding. It's nice of them to do that, but it's YOUR day, not theirs. A lot of parents don't understand this. Sure, they have a say in what they're paying for, flowers, decorations, food, etc., but not who you want to be there. That's your decision. You want to be comfortable and happy on your day and surrounded by people who love and appreciate you.

She's abusing other members of the family, or perhaps a better word would be neglectful to her obligations and duties...I think you and your mother and father need a little family counseling to let go of some anger and develop a REASONABLE plan to help your sister see the light...what you're thinking is not IT.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|cOce5YbRaa	I'm not sure where you live but I live in Texas and at our schools, they have a boot camp program for troubled teens. It isn't any fun either because I have seen what these men do with these kids. It is like you see on the movies where the Instructors are actually from the Army or have been in the Army and they get right in the kids faces and scream, holler, cuss, etc if they have to. They do not let these kids by with anything period. They are hard on these kids which these kids need it badly. If I was you and your Mom, the first place I would check is with the school your sister goes to. They can guide you in the right direction and help you in getting her into the boot camp. Where I live, a parent can't just put a troubled teen in a boot camp without other outside help like the school, police, etc.  I wish you and your Mom the best. I know how bad it can be. My step-daughter needs to be in one but her Dad won't do it. She has gotten physically violent with her Dad and me on numerous occasions besides all the cussings we take from her and other crap on nearly a daily basis. It is fixing to break me and her Dad up for good this time. I have already told him this and it is up to him on whether he gets her help or loses me. I have given him until this Sunday to make up his mind. If he doesn't get her help, I am packing all of their things and put it out on the front porch for him to pick up after he gets off work. I'm sorry you and your family have to deal with a troubled teenager, but it seems like now days, more than 90% of the teenagers have attitude issues among disrespect and no morals. I will be glad when it is all over and it is going to be for me by Monday morning if he doesn't get her help. It's a living nightmare and solid hel*!!  My best to you and your parents.|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	What about Paris Island, Paris Island is a Marine Boot Camp.|`|LkA7g9yUaa	You can look into Elk River Wilderness Challenge at www.thepinnacleschools.com.  It's a wilderness program rather than a boot camp but she will definitely learn to appreciate what she has and respect others. We focus on natural and logical consequences. In other words if she decides not to do a chore they won't "make" her do it. But she'll sit there until she decides to do it. The staff will bring her food to her, she'll sleep there (under supervision of course) until she decides to do it. <br>  <br>  It's an 8-10 week program AND the other added plus is accredited academic curriculum so she won't fall behind in school. <br>  <br>  If you look into other programs you can give us a call and we'll answer those questions too. I can also send you a sheet of questions you should ask when looking for a program. Most importantly, make sure the program is LICENSED!!!! I understand your frustrations with your sister but the top priority needs to be her safety. I'd be happy to send you the sheet regardless of if you're interested in Elk River.
EjyD1sXeaa	your mother knows you love her.<br>  you and your brother have to stand up to your Dad and confront him and get a doctor to visit and see the situation.<br>  she needs professional care<br>  if you can't convince your Dad, take the law into your own hands and take your mother to a hospice where your Dad can't find her
94C2U5FLaa	he said he wants to be your friend, he wants to be your friend!|`|0RI3LDX4aa	well there are other people who probably know about the incident so when he is around those other people he get cocky and dosent want them to get the wrong impression so he shys away from you, but when you aer alone there is nobody to see that he is talking to you so he dosent mind, its nothing against you hun|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that he doesn't know how he feels right now and give it time and see what happens.|`|srNze5uIaa	Maybe he thoughts that people would notice XD<br>  I don't know, but he may be building something in his head anytime you speak, and believe everybody heard you like he did.<br>  <br>  Anyway, yes, he is confusing, but if he said that you were just friends, then don't try to see something that maybe does not exist, so that no matter what, you will avoid disappointement.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he likes you<br>  get a clue<br>  ask him out<br>  he is shy
m2PywmHBaa	take her on a date and dress up(not to much tho) and show her that you can be serious and that its not all fun and games|`|pbrfZQ53aa	It seems shes interested in someone else and is using this as a way to let you down easy. Move on and don't worry about it, she'll look back and realize she really missed out when she ends up with some jerk-off or Mr. TOO Serious|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	hmm dont feel bad.  youre inexperience, her inexperience with life and dating.  keep trying and not necessarily with her.  chalk it up to few experiences and learn from this one.  peace|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	It was only one date.

Move on, look for someone who likes you for who you are.  Plus you are young have fun quit stressin!|`|FQxUpc9baa	yes try to step it up for her|`|22ojjhZhaa	I would say ask her directly what she means by serious.  I can't think of any girl that wants a serious guy so maybe she means serious relationship-wise.  if thats the case, you seem like you are so tell her you are. if she wants a serious guy, she's a weirdo run the other way (just kidding!).  and if she doesn't have an answer, she probably just doesn't see you that way so find someone better.|`|QYahxUEWaa	Maybe if you tell her this..<br>  <br>  'm not just a clown, and that i really am interested in her and want to try again?<br>  <br>  <br>   TELL HER THAT .|`|BosXJUoFaa	by flashing your thing, that will convince her your serious

In that case, keep looking.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	If you are a hottie i'd dump him for a guy who is more financially stable, if you aren't then i guess you are stuck with the loser...lol|`|PyjZVn28aa	my bf is in so much CC deit that its unreal.when we started dating he quit his job before finding another..so he was using his CC to buy things....and last month he lost his job...so we had no money....for anything....the past weekend he just got a job and now he will be making good money if he can keep the job....i havent gotten any kind of gifts from him since christmas of 2007...nothing for my bday nothing for valentines day..cause he cant afford it...it kind of hurts but i understand....but i still stay with him..becuase he is a mechanic and i know we are just starting out and in the future it will get better....<br>  <br>  so if you really love him....you can help him save his money...maybe put some away in a separate account just incase for anything..|`|htpxHZTPaa	First off it took me a little minute to figure out you said "get rid" but anyway. If you only want him for his money and never gave a natural ratz ... about him then yeah go ahead.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|yb01tlviaa	are you kidding me?!  Youre thinking of dumping him because of his CREDIT SCORE?!  Wow, low.  Anyways, yes, leave him, as he deserves better.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Are you with him cuz you love him or for his credit? If you care for this guy you are not going to dump him cuz he has bad credit. Would you want to be judged on your credit as to whether a guy wanted to stay with you or not?  Seems pretty shallow. He can repair his credit in time as long as he is responsible enough to do that.|`|DibzbnVhaa	If you think love comes down to a credit score go ahead and drop him. A credit score of 550 simply means that he was probably late on few car payments and credit card payments or sometimes even an unpaid credit card account.|`|FQxUpc9baa	if u love him enough then stick around and help him rasie his score. but on the other hand if he doesn't care about his score then leave now cause that type never will care. and u will end up hurting your credit cause all debt will b n your name|`|44Sj3bsZaa	you should stay with him if you love him, his credit shouldnt effect how you feel about him and if it does then you obviously dont feel too strongly about him.|`|19ILDxBsaa	stick with him and help him build his credit up. <br>  <br>  besides, as long as one of you has good credit you'll be alright.|`|cvVMJQRZaa	Shows how much you really care, if you are willing to dump him because of his credit. Sounds like he should drop you.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Dump this loser before you get a credit score like his .|`|5nAnWp3daa	why would you get rid of someone becuase bad credit?|`|ayNhwPY3aa	Run. Any guy that has bad credit will eventually end up ruining yours. This is a very bad character trait on his part. He is very irresponsible. Move on. He will only hold you back in life. If you two ever had a kid together. . . just think. . if he can't even pay on his credit card bill. . .do you really think he would not miss any child support payments? This is a big red flag. You deserve better. He is a loser. <br>  <br>  Find yourself a REAL man, that is capable of standing on his own. Real men, don't need a woman to support them.|`|v4r1iFB7aa	550 is bad, but it's not worth breaking up with him over.  If you're even considering it you should let him go.  Credit is important, but it shouldn't make or break a relationship.  Make a pro con list and do some serious thinking about it.|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	We all make mistakes.  Especially when we are young and think we can conquor all we make financial mistakes that take time to reverse.  It's nothing to dump someone over.  If you like him you like him.  His credit score should not enter in to it in any way.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Take walks and enjoy the view. How about joining a parent activity group near you?|`|vvQBkzCtaa	reading ,make crafts out of house hold things toilet paper rolls paper yarn, etc.and you could sing play games make up stories, dance, kids love to help-, so teach her how to use the microwave , make toast, let her put the clothes in the dryer, let her vacume, she will most likely play with it a bit but who cares, she could dust,let her dress up in your old clothes and shoes and jewlry , and put makeup on her and do her hair and let her do yours too have fun,|`|7i0r7DZoaa	You could go on walks every day, to the park, or the swimming pool (You could sit by the side.) She could meet up with her friends as well. Oh yeah!!! Try to see if there is a tumble tots playgroup near you because my sister went, and she said it was sooooo fun!

AA10351134	Have you looked at the sites that do candy by color? Because candy warehouse (for example) has pages of candy in silver, much less white. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of a retro candy buffet or just doing the stuff you love, but you should also be able to find the colors you want.<br>  <br>  Of course you can always knock together "mismatched" candies by tying coordinating ribbons around the containers, putting up signs in your colors, laying a runner underneath the display, etc.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Well, if you can't find candy in those colors, why not focus on wrappers?

bn38G3QGaa	girly, high school is a big deal to him. Its a big deal, especially ur first year. Keep talking to him, but dont be pushy. He will come around, once the excitement and stress goes away of being a high schooler. Its also difficult to date someone younger then you. He will be changing a LOT over the next few years, and if u stick by him, he will have a spcial soft spot for you. Trust me. I know everyone hates waiting, but its the best advice i can give u. Just be who u are with him, and he will come around. Good luck!!!|`|JVCZOL8yaa	you're 13.... what are you doing. atleast wait till highschool... maybe when you're in high school he'll admit that he has feelings for you.. until then.. just wait, he's probably scared himself.. you're just a kid to him right now|`|Qf3mHHkcaa	i think you should just be friends. he is older than you.|`|jI2dusqFaa	how many guys do u love????|`|mFGw6zoCaa	if he texts you everyday he obviously likes you! x x
M2QPCeN5aa	I have the same problem it drives me insane we broke up and yet i still like him.  I think it will just take time.  He is a total jerk and i want him out of my life even tho i wish we were still dating.  Im confusing myself. haha  I am trying to forget about it but i cant so i would just wait and if he really wants u then he will come and get u back
EJWphb88aa	till u feel tat this man is worth making love to... there is no time limit..|`|ku5NPnkfaa	When your married if your not gonna do that then wait at least 6 months.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	About two months,but it really depends on you and that person's connection and if your confident and ready to do it.|`|koAaPXKQaa	We were together in high school then went our seperate ways then met again in university and waited 6months into this relationship. So altogether I guess we waited around 6years lol. We have been together for almost 3years now and we know that sex is not the most important thing in our relationship :)|`|Vk4mZi5Yaa	Well i waited 3 weeks into my relationship when i was 15 years old and i don't regret it at all, but it varies. I think there isn't a set time on how long you should wait, its just all about when you feel comfortable and you trust the person. <br>  <br>  But i suppose the older you are the shorter time you wait.<br>  <br>  x|`|JXrvbW7caa	I'm a virgin, so I would wait until I loved the guy. <br>  But if I wasn't a virgin, I would probably wait about a month.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	marriage|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	I'm gonna try to wait until I'm married. Or if I feel really comfortable with the person and I'm sure we're completely committed to each other. Probably not before a year, but it depends on the person.|`|derWVwf6aa	depends on how old you are.  i think its important to wait a while.... not until marriage persay.... but maybe 4-6 months.... it makes it so much better when you are really ready, and love the person.... plus the wait makes it better!|`|htpxHZTPaa	I say when i've 100% found the right guy, when i get married and when we are both ready.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|37M3dkkRaa	ALWAYS wait at least one month, maybe 2...depends on the guy, some guys will just use you and get what they want, then leave...never give it up fast.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I'm a christian and I believe you should wait until you are married.|`|AA12050428	Until you get married.|`|AA10857451	A couple of months.|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	i agree it depends when it feels right<br>  <br>  deffo not in the first couple of days lol or even in the first week or so|`|5MuTwO6naa	it is a tough question these days with so much sex thrown at us all the time.i guess these days a guy would respect a Lady's wishes he you waited a month or so.i know people who had sex on the first night and are still together years later but also know people who waited until they got married.so there is no wrong or right but like you said you'll know when the time is right.also you don't really need to go all the way whats wrong with just a bit of sexy fun.enjoy.|`|UKYDpztQaa	i really think it depends. like if you have been friends with the guy a while or even just talking than you dont need that extra time to get to know him. in this case id say a week or two if your comfortable with it and see a longer relationship with them. but if you havent known them too long and just started a relationship id give it a good month at least. it really depends on how well you know the person and what you want out of the relationship. its different with every guy|`|2SQ77DlXaa	around 3 months, depends on how long you've known the person for eg. if you've been friends for years and then become a couple just whenever you feel ready but if you've only recently met someone i'd wait a few months until you got to know them.|`|YANN4mXNaa	I always believe once you have their name is sufficient.<br>  I hate having to call someone darling in the morning because I have no idea what her name is.|`|71EwzPSlaa	i go with when the times right....if i had to put a specific time id say within the first month lol...cant be much longer than that otherwise i feel like im just wasting time|`|wyAbkG3oaa	I waited a month with my second boyfriend.

Sorry.:)|`|bEaJHY1uaa	ummm.... im guessing 3 months|`|qOLB6zYIaa	depending on how long u see each other 3 weeks? a month?|`|UmNCNNNwaa	first or secend time|`|5DkLNGd2aa	In my opinion it all depends on your age if your older sex is much more mundane therefore it will happen much quicker. I feel it also depends on where you see the relationship going if you see a long future i would suggest waiting around 6 months this can give you time to get used to each other and really if it's going to happen fall in love with the person. Myself and my girlfriend waited 4 months and that's simply because i rushed her into it and it is something i regret unfortunately. In all honesty really it doesn't matter how anyone replys you've already said it yourself you have to feel right about it and know that it's the right time that's pretty much as simple as it gets. Sorry if i wasn't much help haha but i tried|`|v4r1iFB7aa	Every one is different.  it depends on your age, beliefs, values, and your relationship.  I personally was 16 and in the relationship for 6 months, and wish i would have waited for the right one.  Wait longer than you think you should.  My husband and I knew each other for six years before we dated, but then had sex after only two dates.  You really do know when the right time is.  If you have to ask it's not time.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	Well, I am Christian and my religion's beliefs are after marriage but these days who can stand to wait that long?! I would say that you should wait until you feel comfortable and stable in the relationship, that way it won't ruin anything you already have.|`|yjliGiRmaa	well my man and i had sex a week after we started dating and we r still together we've been married for 7 year and we have three children together im only 26 1/2 yrs old and we still have great sex and can't have anymore kids that a really good thing do to the economy.|`|DibzbnVhaa	It really depends on your age, but usually a couple of months is reasonable.|`|q4GKwz8Saa	twos months but still **** happends you never know....i always wait two months..or take the girl to the hospital and check her out|`|IeLBIACaaa	depending on age.  if youre both young then longer.  if you in your mid 20s then 3-4 dates should be plenty.|`|RWiom35vaa	until marriage! then again i am religious|`|CxPO6FwYaa	30mins|`|T65zKsgiaa	6th date get in bed then!|`|OuT9fMiTaa	I guess u should wait untill u r married|`|G3AFxtzNaa	a month :)|`|1c7ae0c66371a47863c18796255b720caa	a few weeks
r3O9XCSBaa	Everyone is different. Bleed and some don't. But before you have sex you need to make sure it is with the right person. And if you are asking if you bleed then I don't think you are old enough to have it. Ask your mom or ask a doctor.
YzgCab38aa	they put out all the time, know all the tricks, and earn good money -<br>   what else a man needs? You know, they do not care about things like<br>   being "nice", "morals" and so on. Men usually stay with the mist<br>   convenient woman  they can get - the one who earns the most and put<br>   out the most. All other things do not matter. If they find a better<br>   deal, they will dump the stripper, using her profession as a pretext.<br>   If they can't find any better, they will stay on and turn the blind<br>   eye. They would not even mind her cheating, providing it brings money<br>   home.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Maybe it's just the guys your attractive to.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	Funnily enough strippers are people too and can be decent females. Most of them are independent too so how about you stop stereotyping and stop being bitter|`|37M3dkkRaa	my ex also dated a stripper, and left her for me because he said she had lousy sex and she wasnt as fun as he thought she would have been. so im guessing they're just looking for a good time, and as for the girl who said to stop stereotyping, no1 would stereotype if people wouldn't dance on a pole and take their clothes off...pretty much like prostitution with no sex, how disgusting is that?...and the only people i know who are/were strippers are all addicted to drugs and are lousy parents, not saying all of them are, but just the ones i know.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	There are two answers to this one.<br>  <br>  Strippers are women too. Some women do this to get money. And nothing else. They may meet some decent men out there and do leave the profession.<br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  Women who strip may have emotional problems. Or have low self esteem. Some men exploit them. And these women never really escape that world.<br>  <br>  I guess my final answer is that there are many men out there who are decent and would love to meet you. Keep looking. He may be closer than you think.|`|Rb087BsAaa	It's only dating...nothing long term.  It's the thrill of probably awesome sex and having sweet arm candy around.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Because they're wild and good in bed.<br>  Strippers are people, too!|`|lGByR3lcaa	Lol, as a living breathing stripper I can tell you that it's a myth that strippers are better in bed, I mean I suppose we *are* more sexually expressive which could be considered better, but not all of us replicate our stage tricks in the bedroom, just like not all McDonald's employees deep fry everything at home. Once we get outside the club we all have our own real world things to deal with, we're not all trick turning prostitutes. Guys may like strippers better on the first take because we express their fantasies better(it comes with the job), but a lot of us do make decent girlfriends because we *are* independent, we know how to manage our own money well, and we know better than to bring the drama home from work. Strippers are women too.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Because men are dogs and it's all about visual crap they don't think about how nice a girl is or what she has to offer to the relationship it's all about the way she looks good and how other guys will be gawking at her. They fail to realize that that chick has shown every guy in town something that should be sacred to their man which is her body...it shouldn't be out there for the whole world to see!!!! Men's brains are between their legs most of the time they are idiots!!!!|`|uAhqtWuyaa	Truthfully it's probably because they real good in bed.

Mainly, she just drives me completely and utterly insane, which is a little bit different. I think that you still have to take the same approach with it though.<br>  <br>  This is what I would do: be as nice as you possibly can for as long as you can handle it. This is what I have done for the past 4 years and it has seemed to work, until most recently, when I just decided that I'm not going to try anymore. If she wants to act like that, then fine. I'll just let her be immature and childish. Which is what your future mother in law is doing. So how dare she say that about you. It's EXTREMELY immature of her to act this way! <br>  <br>  Hold your head up high and take the high road. Show her that you are in fact not the immature one, she is. Do this as long as you can. If and when it starts to really take a toll on you and you just can't do it anymore, then don't. Do what you want. You can only try for so long until you're just exhausted of trying. At that time, you can then call HER out on it. This might be several years. I am finally getting to that point in my life where I can do that to my mother in law. Sometimes, you have to draw the line. But wait it out to see if it gets better.

LBW8Rv35aa	I think this depends on the type of cruise. If it is an adult oriented event, then the kids probably should not come. However, if it's just a normal, fun cruise, then why not? The kids can go swim in the pool or something while the adults be adults. As long as the parents know their children are capable of being well behaved and not being a nuisance to your gathering, I don't see it as a problem. However if the kids are very young and/or need constant supervision, I would consider asking the couple to make arrangements or stay home.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	no, i don't think it's a good idea. even if you bring your kids ans so do everyone else, you are putting a big crimp in your social time because when kids get tired or bored they get cranky and ruin not only your group but anybody who is within hearing distance. tell your friend that if she can't find someone to babysit you'll miss her. show her this answer maybe she'll see your point.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	No, its not acceptable.

Tell them as nicely as possible that it was agreed when you all started arranging the holiday that it was going to be a child-free break. What are they going to do? Sit in their cabin every night while the rest of the group go and enjoy themselves?? And then they're probably expect some of you to feel guilty and offer to watch to kids for a few of the nights so they can go out and enjoy themselves. Its not fair on anyone. If they haven't found a sitter then they should forfeit the holiday and go another time on their own.|`|fIq0qOePaa	i think it would be okay to have the kids on the trip with you guys , espically if they don't have a baby sitter . so they have to bring their children .

TlnTKyXxaa	In my opinion...While it is true that when you go out with someone you also spend time in their social circle, it does seem a little odd to take friends on a date. Were these occasions specified as dates? Try not to get too wound up about how you spend lunch, but if you want a normal date, you arrange to take her out somewhere, anywhere. But make the destination a surprise for her. A romantic dinner, some kind of activity you might do like rock climbing or a skating, preferably something at least one of you can do. Anything fun and/or romantic (i.e date-ish)<br>  <br>  All choices aside, just take her out somewhere. That way you're taking charge of the evening. And if she mentions contacting her mates to see if they can come, let her know that you want it to be a date, and not just hanging out.

They have no right to tell you you can't learn to drive, you're a fully grown adult.|`|8ztWRIHMaa	i have a good idea what you mean i would suggest stealing one of your church sister man lol just kidding... however i don't really have any idea just think positive and learn to drive|`|NTEuxMVmaa	If you waited this long than when you go to college you'll enjoy all you have missed out on.Since you've waited this long one year will zoom by.good luck|`|MIw3GCJyaa	Easy to say:  Be happy with yourself, for if you can't be, then how can anyone else be happy with you.<br>  <br>  Relax you have loads of time.|`|1NLuejtyaa	look for anybody who needs a room mate.<br>  move in with them and you will have thatr person as a friend who can get you connections to single guys or other friends|`|Grb85RJuaa	Find some company|`|yyIVrngcaa	you need to take on more hobbies! besides bible studies, I'd be bored with that...it's cool if you're into it though...chat more with online friends...get a pet...you'll think of something.|`|bIi0GSx5aa	I'm not sure about advice on human contact, but a chat room may help. It's not physical contact, but it passes time. <br>  Also what I do to pass the time is to look at places in my house and write a poem about an item I see. It may not be much, but it can be a productive pass time until you get to college.<br>  If you like drawing that could also help. I think that hobbies could keep you productive and pre-occupied until you go to college.<br>  I hope that this helps and I also hope that things get better for you.

AA10986891	It is probable that one of her new friends or all her new friends started that silly rumor and she won't tell you cause she wants to protect them.<br>  <br>  What you can do is let this go, distance your self a little from her. Keep in touch with her texts, IM, emails, etc. In a few months this thing would be forgotten and you will be friends again.|`|wdDYM7TJaa	If she's ignoring you, she isn't your real friend, and cares about this new girl more than your friendship with her.|`|SZKEydttaa	irk i had the same problem with several of my friends and just ask her about it and she what she says and if she doesnt say anything just walk away and find some in friends to kinda make her jealous and then a little while later ask about it agian and a true friend would tell u what is up.<br>  <br>  hope i helped....|`|XBANzskuaa	I would just tell her and explain it all to her. if she still doesn't want to believe u or be or friend or whatever then i would say hang with other ppl. hope it helped :) good luck
cP03k3cXaa	I hate my mother, she tried to kill me when I was 16 for being an hour late getting home from school. And what's worse is she has no criminal record for what she did to me or any of my siblings. Try living with that, your own mother that's supposed to love and support instead tries to kill you?|`|AA12198711	I use to think I did until I realized how it affected me more than the person I felt it toward. <br>  <br>  I decided then to feel sorrow for them because they were they way they were. <br>  <br>  Hate grows in you like mold does on a surface. If you let it get out of hand it is very hard to get rid of.<br>  <br>  It is my sister. She thinks she is better than anyone. Steals, lies and cheats to make herself look better to herself and others. Belittles people also. I hit 50 years old and decided I did not need to subject myself to her any longer or her ways.|`|AA10986891	Hate does not exist. Hate is just love disguised in anger.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	haha, you know your name is the title of a book? I read it recently...<br>  Anyway, back to your question.<br>  I think that you can't really HATE someone in your family. I mean, you may have your arguments and everything, but there are some good times that you have with each other. People stress out the word hate way too much, and that's where people start saying things to their family like, "I HATE YOU!"<br>  And really, you just can't hate your family. There's this built in love that you have with each other that's always going to be there no matter what.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	If you mean in laws as well-yes I do.<br>  My sister in law is a total nightmare-she belittles me at every opportunity.Just because she has a Degree and I don't she talks to me like one of her children.<br>  My husband's brothers wife is no better-she just stick her nose into everyone 's business-wether they like it or not.!<br>  I just want to get away from all of them-they make me sick!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	No one should hate anyone.

When I was 12 he came back into my life after she took me away from him and he promised he'd changed so she had an affair with him but he ruined everything in both of our lives and threatened to kill us if she got with any other man. He was so abusive and misses my birthdays and Christmas, etc. to this very day. He never even calls me. I see him on summers when he comes down to buy drugs from my next door neighbour and says "hi" to me. What a dad right?|`|AA11735670	yes  ....no  ..hard  Q  ..can  you  really  really  hate  a  member  of  your  family  ...even  if  they have  done  bad  by  you  ...think  not  ..others  may  hate  them  for  what  they  done  to  you  but   really  don't  think  can  answer  that  truthfully  think  have  things  done  and  said  but have  forgiven  but that's  me  cant  answer  for  others   .. but  think  others  may  have  worse  scenarios so  truthfully  depends  on  Why  ..they  hate   not  going  there  but  can  understand  why  ..|`|O6nBICcMaa	my mom. she only thinks negative stuff about me...like literally just negative...she never belives anything i say and she can be abusive sometimes...i guess im wrong for saying this but i cant control my feelings...=\|`|e3xzMnuHaa	i could never hate anyone especially a family member even thinking of that makes me feel absolutley sick|`|AA10377899	No.. Even if they were the evilest of the eveilest.. I think we must love our famly regardless of anything else.
Uj5kuzoJaa	That is really long...<br>  Tell the friend that you still like him because if she's willing to give him back to you then that says that she's not that into him either. Tell her and then tell the guy. WARNING the guy kinda sounds like a player. How will you trust him not to do the same thing to you when you guys are dating? Just a thought
geKBgvrQaa	okay first of all this girl gabby or whatever shes not your friend if she was your friend then she wouldn't have went back behind your back and went out with your ex. i say move on cause to me it just sounds like a continuing cycle and she said he said all trying to make someone jealous. obviously he wants you but hes gonna have to make the move. you just call him as a friend  one day and talk to him and kinda break the ice. cause i know its kinda of awkward at the moment when you two are together. i say move on but if you cant and you just have to have him let your friend and him know the truth and see what happens good luck :D
prU72N2Vaa	Go with three other two sound like losers
uxwSd0KLaa	He was polite with you ; period|`|nZjdi0wKaa	he has nothing to do <br>  or he has no one to  hang around with so he chosed you <br>  but you can choose him if you want no big deal|`|hb4UFSR3aa	He was trying to get your attention and  he wants to impress. So i say he was flirting but to make sure see if he talks to you allot and makes eye contact with you.|`|ld2anrdLaa	hes flirting :P no doubt about it XD read it as if you were someone else and you'd say the same thing :P if you like him go for it if not try staying away :P
Tf19RETiaa	i've always had that problem, im trying to practice by talking to new people but pretending their like an old friend so its easier to talk.<br>  good luck i kno its hard. =)
pYvuq2Gjaa	i think that there are people out of a persons league but only because everyone has different personalities and life-styles,not everyone is compatible with each other.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	Research shows that people tend to form relationships with someone of equal "attractiveness" so there is something to the "out of your leauge" concept. <br>  <br>  Often, someone may not be out of your leauge...meaning you are just as attractive as them, but due to poor self esteem, you don't think so.  Othertimes, someone has so much confidence and personality, they become much more attractive than their natural appearance.|`|UXUi83fWaa	i think it is more of a self esteem issue. ive noticed that attractive people tend to take care of themselves, like working out and stuff, thus making them attractive. i've figured that if you want something you should be able to give it. lol thats why i work out and eat healthy!!|`|AA11806027	most of you don't know the meaning of the word confidence,most of you say that nice guys have no confidence because they care about the women their with.what wrong with you women?|`|NuPwR75Jaa	I think its just self esteem/confidence issues .. if a not very pretty girl was really confident and has self esteem i think a fine lad could be interested in them or vise versa. (:|`|KcXFs6Fzaa	Robert Pattinson, haha!|`|FLPRFTccaa	everyone should love me  cause im a really really cute bunny wabbit.|`|zC1YoIbuaa	never think someone is "out of your league"|`|OGMJcikIaa	I think that people can be out of your league.  But I think that we have the ability to grow and join the others that are above our ranks with time.  It's like playing a sport, you wouldn't want to get thrown into the Olympics as a swimmer if you just learned how to swim...but with time and practice you can get there and compete with them.  At the same time, still hypothetically speaking, you could say the Olympic swimmers aren't in your league because you are the judge of what the ultimate league is in your life.  So in a way I guess you need the self esteem or self confidence to know that only you can judge what the league you are playing in happens to be and who you want to be playing with you in the field.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	A little bit of both.|`|PGanZdtmaa	it has a lot of self esteem/ confidence to do with it!|`|AA10743159	People are people after all, and no one is out of your league. But if you think they are, then, they will be. <br>  Like the old saying goes, "Shoot for the Star, and even if you don't get it, you may end up with the Moon".<br>  So it's all down to your own self esteem and confidence. If you are a confident person, you will be more willing to take that risk or that chance. You may fail, but you will have tried. Which would you rather regret, that you tried and failed, or that you didn't even try?|`|SFai2Eb9aa	sometimes that is true, and sometimes it isnt:[|`|Rb087BsAaa	yeah at first.  then you start talking and realize they are just another person.|`|ApXHcYVfaa	defintely both!
2vgbJhlRaa	guy1-just say i want to be friends and nothing more. dont patronize him with the "your a great guy, you will find someone" it hurts because he probably does like you alot. <br>  <br>  guy2&3- decide which one you like more because in the end it can only be one ya? so whichever one you like more go after him. it sounds like you like the 3rd guy more. just bring up the prom casually and hint that you would like him to take you...i.e "so prom his coming up.....are you gonna go?" lol best of luck

Uj5kuzoJaa	Decide on who you value more. Your friendship or the crush on that guy. Think of it this way. What if you ruin your friendship over this, and then it doesn't even work out between you and the guy? Friends will be there when you need them. You can't tell how long you might last with that guy. Don't take you friends guy. It's mean and hurtful. Try to find someone else to like.|`|4L1c8kF8aa	Ask yourself this......... Why would you want to sleep with a man that your best friend is ********............ get a life, and be for real tramp......
lNlL0Ag2aa	Lol of course it would tick him off, he wants you to be interested in him and not interested in someone else. Sure that he knows you two are just friends but he still hopes that you might change your mind and finally grow interested in him.
drI1vsJdaa	Maybe. But you do deserve better. That is really slutty that she'd do that. Be happy she's gone! You'll find your girl soon! Talk to some of the girls you like :P I bet they like you too!
f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	I'm going to be honest.<br>  <br>  I have thought about this same question.My husband and I have talked about it and he has told me if this is what I want to try.Then he would stand by me.He also said that he could just be there to watch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now after sitting here and really thinking about this.I have come to this.<br>  <br>  1.I wouldn't/couldn't break the vows that I made to my husband the day we got married.<br>  <br>  2.There are some many STD's and Aids.You really don't know who got it,until it's to late.<br>  <br>  3.I'm a proud mother to a 3 year old daughter and 1 year old son.How would that make me look to them if they would find out about this.I know it wouldn't be now or soon,but down the road they hear about it.I want to set examples for my children and be a good role model and parent to them.Showing them the right things in life,instead of the wrong.<br>  <br>  4.Is this showing any kind of respect to my husband,marriage or familyor Myself by doing this.No,it's not.In the end,it may or may not cause problems,but I'm not going to take the chance and ruin a HAPPY HOME And HAPPY MARRIAGE.<br>  <br>  5.What's MINE is MINE and I don't like to share with any one.<br>  <br>  Now all is said,This little fantasy is going to be just that.A fantasy that will never happen but just be a mere imagine in our heads of what could be.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Hahaha Allison... LOL You crack me up. Glad I clicked on the question.<br>  <br>  The reason why I haven't actively pursued a 3some in real life is that I'm actually very reserved as a person, and it would feel awkward to me to bring another woman/couple into the bedroom, be it with my husband or with someone else.

Although I'm not really sure what it takes to bully someone...<br>  <br>  I've never understood how us girls ( not all of course ) can just form a gang and start abusing another girl. As I said in your other question, it was whilst I was living abroad - in my early teenage years - that I experienced this.....they ganged up against me and made me feel like trash.<br>  <br>  I could never bring myself to bully someone else...I'm just not that kind of person.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't let those little bitches get you down xx|`|QQdOpG2xaa	uhmm yes, she was making fun of my friends acne, so i called her fat,<br>  we are actually very close friends now,<br>  this was a few years ago, and I do not speak like that anymore,|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HONEY,,I LIVE BY THE CODE...""WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND"""AND KARMA WILL EVENTULLY THROW LOTS OF BAD LUCK TO ALL BULLIES,,,,,PEACE
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	I hear wedding bells...|`|xF6e9LcJaa	i believe he does yes!|`|rHY7ESOgaa	if hes always looken at you i would say he is very into you just go for it and flirt back you just might be in with a chance with this boy
pVnUhYLQaa	Umm... Yes?|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	pillow talk is an art. enjoy it while it lasts.|`|GoABmevnaa	It's hard to really say because other things besides what he said can be considered intimate... for example, the way he touches you and holds you, and whether he lets you enjoy the sex too instead of only worrying about himself.<br>  Some guys like to talk dirty during sex, but you'll be able to tell if it was intimate or not.<br>  My boyfriend used to talk during sex alot and it would make me frustrated because I would only be concentrated on what he was saying instead of the sex... and one say I told him not to talk (just joking around) and it was the best sex we've ever had... that day we made love. and I didn't have to question it, I just knew.
GLBWe3A9aa	Yup|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Don't get your hopes up.  <br>  <br>  A player will cheat on you eventually.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Yes, it can happen... but it doesn't happen very often.|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Im 16 and i have already experienced this. I used to be a player and get in bed with tons of girls but then i met one girl who i just fell in love with for some reason and completely changed me now i dont try and get with girls cause i only like one. So yes we can change like that and have feelings for one girl|`|EyaqiWPwaa	um....depends if shes making him sandwiches all the time....i think mostly that guys who eat multiple sandwiches have to find the best one to eat on a consistant basis|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Its called having an open relationship.<br>  but make sure she knows.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes, and that will be the one that you can never ever get.
VSVQHKwKaa	I think Valerie X response just illustrates the real problem.<br>  <br>  Women ( the bad ones anyway) get this ridiculous notion that sex is some kind of big "sacrifice" they make to their husbands.<br>  <br>  And if the husband is not, in their mind, up to snuff, then the solution is to hold back sex until he gets better.<br>  <br>  Despite the fact that this almost never works (or not for very long) it does make the woman feel powerful and in control.<br>  <br>  Now in a dating situation, the woman feels a need to have commitment. She's willing to trade sex to feel committed to.<br>  <br>  Once marriage, the ultimate commitment, comes into play, she no longer wishes to trade sex for commitment and the sex supply steadily drops.<br>  <br>  Note that this is not all women, and certainly no mark of a good wife.<br>  <br>  Rather than seeking control by starving a man to death, women should attempt to seek control by becoming the source of intimacy, love, pleasure, and devotion.<br>  <br>  A woman who gives her man lots of love is building him up as a man. This means that whenever he feels down, he goes to her for comfort. And any threat to that comfort and intimacy becomes an obstical that he is willing to overcome and solve. <br>  <br>  And that's the correct equation for marriage (as you've outlined above).<br>  <br>  What this DOESN"T do...is allow women a sense of smug satisfaction when they're displeased with their men.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, because marriage is becoming a futile insitution (no-fault divorces, welfare state, custody laws, social workers, allimony, ect) this is no longer holding up.<br>  <br>  Men are going elsewhere for their comfort and pleasure (drugs, booze, internet porno, video games, gambling, and adultury).<br>  <br>  So a very common senario is this:<br>  <br>  1. Man disappoints woman.<br>  2. Woman witholds sex from man<br>  3. Man seeks alternate source of comfort.<br>  4. Woman becomes more disappointed in man.<br>  5. Repeat.<br>  <br>  And you're right...it's a road to hell. <br>  <br>  You know...I thought women ENJOYED sex. Why is this such an issue?<br>  <br>  Answer: Because when Ego is greater than commitment to the marriage, the marriage ends. <br>  <br>  Good Question.|`|RluCMVUSaa	Its a ploy... yeah dishes are nice and all of that but really we want bigger things after year five... then you have to start rationing your trade to have value, supply and demand you know. <br>  <br>  Besides that, do you really think that men wrote the code?  Look at what you men did with taxes... ladies make the trade law in the home... a couch is worth much head, the lawn a good lay... it is all there!|`|AA11501437	i'm behind ya, man - some men are the same way though.  seriously, nothing makes a crappy mood better, takes away stress, gets rid of headaches and insomnia, and revives us in the morning like a little roll in the hay.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	I don't trade sex for "dishes".<br>  <br>  SORRY!|`|NBDLUOkiaa	How in the he!! did I end up with Buzz? He doesn't have to hit a lick at a snake at home and I am so willing. How did I manage to pick one of the seemingly few guys in this world with so little sex drive? It is such a stress reliever and I have a lot of stress to be relieved!  I told my husband that I married him with the mind that I would have my own personal sex slave to avoid being a slut and he blasted that plan all to he!!<br>  <br>  Oh! Sorry I can't help you Mongo, I have my own code to crack!|`|yuBuNoPDaa	We're too busy. We're too tired. We're too stressed. Too much going on. Everything is great in my marriage so we don't have this problem. I wish we had more time but it is what it is.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	believe it or not..not all men's focus is stuck on sex.  That is only a part of a relationship.  When a couple is happy, they have god sex, and often.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	Maybe the problem is you, maybe you arent a good lover in bed? Cuz I am ready and willing to please my man at ALL times.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	All I have to say is - not in my house!  Thankfully sex has never been an issue for us...|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Aw Mongo:(<br>  <br>  Stop doing the dishes, or anything helpful for that matter, until you get laid.  And for the love of god TALK TO HER;)<br>  <br>  ?|`|Olz3goEaaa	At once or twice a month I would just assume she wants me to walk.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Opetke is brilliant! I agree that the majority of women that withhold sex do it for some sort of revenge / power trip and the average guy gets caught up in this trap.  And if a woman just says "I have my vibrator" then they can't b%tch when the sex-starved guy starts looking @ 'pron'.<br>  <br>  This kind of crap is manipulative and I don't tolerate these sorts of headgames.  If I'm bad in bed (and sure, I've had my 'off' days - I'm only human'), then next time be a bit more communicative.  Being good in bed is not some skill one learns by osmosis (as many people think).  If a woman tells me what she likes, I sure as hell won't forget. <br>  <br>  It boils down to basic communication - which we all need to get a little better at.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Ha ha.  In our most recent marriage counseling session, I said that my wife was good with money, and if she came home wearing a fur coat and nothing underneath, I sure wouldn't be thinking about the cost of the coat.<br>  <br>  The counselor seemed to be impressed with my financial gratitude.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	"That one girl" summed it up. I agree with her. Relationships are about give and take, sex isn't a bartering tool. You should be doing your equal share of housework anyway man it's not 1950 now. You and your wife need to talk more.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	You have to find a partner that wants as much sex as you do, everyone is different guys and gals, some want it everyday, some want it once a month, others don't really want it all!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Only men with tiny you know whats have this issue.|`|kbz5S3waaa	so, i'm the horny one in my relationship with my husband. It's always about sex with me, but he just snobbishly looks at me and continues with what he's doing...|`|RwYIhCg8aa	My heart goes out to you, it does only because I'm living in the same HELL.  Seems when you start to get laid, SO DO I!  DAMN THAT WOMAN, DON'T MAKE ME CALL HER!  (Just kidding about the calling part).<br>  <br>  But it really phucken pisses me off that some of the men that answered your question NEVER acknowledge THAT IT WORKS BOTH WAYS!  Men can hold out too, and use excuses as to why they are not putting out, and it has nothing to do with being bad in bed in my case, my husband hears angels sing when we have sex!  But he also uses it as a pawn in a game, telling me things like "If you did this, I'd do that" and STILL doesn't give it up when I meet HIS needs, each and every time.  So, as far as this blame game on the women is concerned, MEN, GO PHUCC YOURSELVES!  <br>  <br>  Now lets see who won't be putting out tonight!
hdEaEbfsaa	well as a guy it sounds to me that he sees somethingg in you that he hasn't in anyone else. he likes you.  he likes your inner beauty andouterr. you have to think about how he said it.  If he said it in a cool or kinda sounded like he was making fun of you then he wanted to hear that he was right. if he said it in a normal kinda way then he was praising u and he respects u for it and that draws him closer to you.  the best thing to do is confront him about the conversation.<br>  <br>  good luck hope this helps. let me know if you don't mind|`|hnCDmgyEaa	Because he thinks very highly of you.|`|AD5cue8Waa	well that doesnt make sense. how are you going to find that perfect guy if you dont date? he probly said that cuz he is trying to convince you to start dating. and he wants to be lucky #1. date HIM
vXa7IeDiaa	Hate is such a strong word..You could of stated why you hate them..<br>  <br>  I can feel you tho..I can't stand my family..I love my mom but she lectures to much..I love my dad but i hate that he is a drunk..I love my sister but i hate that she is 35 years old with 5 kids and still acts like a teenager...<br>  <br>  Its sad that you can't choose your own family..but try and study hard if your in school so you can go to a college far away from them..or get a job so you can move out..good luck|`|PTObqYcMaa	oh man i hear ya loud and clear! ignore them thats what i do! if they call u and try to talk to you, listen to music or somethin and pretend to file ur nails lol thats what i do|`|oopg697aaa	walk out ...but you need them to financially support you don't you...lol|`|1iXvphNYaa	What do you want most out of all this?|`|0udjgaoBaa	I still hate my family and im 29..I kill them with kindness and do better than all of them.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	I think that you should find a counselor to talk to about it because you may or may not have good reason. I mean if they are harming you in some way then its understandable and you need advice about how you should deal with it. But if you are just mad that you dont get your way or something similar to this, then you still need advice about how to handle your frustration. Teenagers go through this sometimes but you are hating everyone, not just your parents so i say seek some Professional help maybe someone at your school can tell you where to go to get it.|`|7jlSKRXBaa	how old r u ?<br>   n y do u nt like them ? <br>   think about u cant hate ur family there ur life they will always be there ur stupid if u hate ur familyy sos but u really are|`|794eeb906c2eeff6ec45d9217ea0ebaeaa	First, calm down.<br>  See some of the reason they don't like him<br>  If it's senseless stuff don't worry because you are dating him not THEM!|`|CJdsTmZRaa	don't do this...<br>  u have just blocked the way...<br>  open it<br>  lets see wht happens after talkin in positive manner<br>  u cannot deny that the are ur family,,,,,<br>  remember they gave birth to u|`|iJbslaQNaa	think about it|`|ZD9jZb9uaa	get to know them bettter :P|`|cvNHRSR4aa	kill the family<br>  bury the bodies in the backyard<br>  and no one will never know
zCE0slQ5aa	Unless a person is blind or communicating over a telephone or the internet; Initial attraction is solely based on Physical Appearance and Individual Vibes. The physical senses are the first to pick-up chemical output between mammals. The fact that we are one of the most fundamentally alert and intelligent creatures on the planet introduces the factor of personal choice above and beyond our instinctive mammal traits. Some people are aroused more by personality than physical appearance. Here in lies the ability of a relationship to grow in time. One needs to know what is inside themselves, how they feel, and what they desire. Measure and weigh what is exceedingly important compared to what is less important. Listen to your first instincts. These are the natural vibes and precursors being set off in your brain. They usually occur before you know it. What is important to you should mimic what is important to your partner. What drives you toward someone? What draws people to you? Extensive dating can offer good insight into what you may be looking for in someone.|`|PGanZdtmaa	personality. looks will fade and soon you'll only be left with personality plus why would you want to go out with some one who's a stuck up jerk? and you're relationship will probably last longer if you don't pick on looks alone. don't get me wrong looks are grand and all but its not everything!|`|HQKuzxulaa	Personality, with my eyes closed.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	They are both important.  I am not going to date a hot guy with zero personality, but I'm not going to date a fun person that I don't find attractive.  You have to take it in equal parts, although personality is always going to triumph.  You can fall for someone that makes you laugh; you can't really fall for someone who is a complete moron, lol.|`|Ra9byn6paa	for me personality for sure<br>  <br>  who cares about what the person looks like if they are mean and rude and don't care about you? i think that personality is really the biggest thing that matters in a person.<br>  <br>  btw i love the song "to be with you" :)|`|FROfw46Yaa	Personality. Hands down. If a guy doesn't have the right personality, it doesn't matter what he looks like. Plus, I think people's looks change once you get to know them.|`|BQXg09m9aa	It has to be a perfect mix of both!|`|85YtzzKraa	Honestly it's both. Unfortunately he can't be below average but he can be average looking! And he should have an awesome personality! Funny and smart! Well spoken and well dressed! These are my requirements! I'm shallow! And it's really bad!|`|tZES73R0aa	Personality! You can be drop dead gorgeas and have the worst personality in the world! guys like a girl that is pretty and has a great personality.|`|FOIPNMvjaa	Personality, but good looks wouldn't hurt. :)|`|vtafeEIJaa	wisdom|`|7xBa7Pi8aa	Personality with decent looks...looks change and its the personality that you have to deal with every day|`|3vnayfR7aa	Personality.<br>  <br>  Looks fade with time. But their personality can always still make you laugh and smile :)|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	looks|`|4NZtFNC1aa	Personality, most definatly.<br>  Looks are somewhat important..but who would want a good looking guy that treats you like sure crap?<br>  I would rather have a guy that doesn't look as good as everyone else, but they would give me the would if they could. ;)|`|gSBz4gaaaa	Personality,been out with very good looking boys,too much competition.|`|wcuba7UEaa	personality, you cant just sit there and stare at someone for the rest of your life, that would get boring
fCKKUtG6aa	i think he kinda likes u but i wouldnt ask him. get closer to him. <br>  if he doesnt like u bac in tht gf/bf way then he definitely thinks of u as a close friend if he's gonna comfort u when ur crying and upset. i dont think he would do tht to just any girl. so u should feel special.|`|4IhXjUpFaa	I think he does like you i mean if he didn't like you then why would he try to comfort you and act happy when he sees you?<br>  does he ever glance at you(look at you and when you look at him he turns away)?If he does he LIKES you!!!|`|CbKsrDX1aa	i would say that he has some feelings for you but idk if there like "your a really good friend and i dont want to lose u" kinda feelings or if there "i really want to be in a relationship with u" kinda feelings. i guess maybe u could just kinda flirt with him in a non joking kinda way, or u could just bring up a hypathetical situation in a conversation like all my friends have a date to movie night and ur sad that u have no one to go with even tho u like this guy, and if he asks about this guy in a "o no she likes someone else" kinda way then u can then just say "but idk if he would go with me" and hint twards him coming with u..... but if he asks about this guy just start telling him about u feel about him(but dont say its u) just tell him "i like this guy and it sucks that we dont go to the same school, and we r really good friends, and i think he might like me but im not sure" and just say whats on ur mind.<br>  he might be one of those guys that just need a little push.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	i thhink he does lyk u a little............n he prob wants 2 c u happy not sad........he was there for u wen ur down so he actin lyk a really gud friend.....but if he hasnt put his arm around n-e other girl that makes u special n he mite lyk u....mite......he could also b just a good friend....<br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry there is a possibilty but its kinda hard 2 make it out...gud luck|`|DozD8lTGaa	Hmm, maybe he thinks you are a good friend... and you helped him out so he done you the favour. you never know though, talk to him about it . x
v3Y0Wij8aa	Love is all about taking risks...and if you do not take the chance she may be telling you the truth you will never know what could have been. It is ok to be a little unsure, and a little afraid, you both sound young, and this will be an experience for both of you to learn how to trust. She sounds a little afraid herself if she asked you if you would cheat on her. Getting played is awful...but that would be shame on her not you. Be your self..and if she is not the one..well she will be along at some point.
7e4jxj3Daa	In bed only.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	only when you want to get laid|`|nJKP7gJGaa	YEs but only in private... you cant just be out flirting and having sex with everything|`|YWdNTZU3aa	i am not homosexual|`|MvY0rlQIaa	yes, but not to other guy's. just them|`|p2HIPtsSaa	yes
OsmHJkFgaa	not exactly, alot of guys flip their hair all the time.. its just a way of  trying to look good... but if he is watching you and when you look at him and he does it, its possible he does..|`|yMibT1Kvaa	He's a fag.|`|Rb087BsAaa	could mean he's a transvestite|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	he wants to have sex now|`|GfCRiueRaa	Hahaha! The only time I flip my hair is when it's getting in my eyes. Guys don't generally flip their hair at girls they like. That's more of a girl thing. d:|`|sEryEzoyaa	haha i would like to know cause this one guy i have a crush on does that a lot when he is around me :) i find it cute tho...|`|24r0kVmyaa	i dont know. none of the guys i know have hair long enough to flip. but anyway, his hair could just be in his eyes|`|FLPRFTccaa	no it means he has got stupidly long hair which needs cutting. or he was spazzing out.
GrBH30vfaa	No, men's best friend is THE GIRL who got the diamond !|`|OXtYMoVLaa	A dog supposedly|`|3lYBFgqwaa	His dick<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its true|`|aNJhRxvHaa	Dogs! :)|`|AA12060117	sports, of course!|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Dogs are man's best friend or so they say|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	his dog|`|MB0ARQiJaa	lol SEX!|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Boys best friends are girls and boys enemies are diamonds.|`|tylml4Vvaa	his dog.|`|pVaZty4Maa	his dog lol, thats what everyone says
Ilq7WEM5aa	Yeah i think so. It's definitely true in my case. My first love was when i was 12, and we've remained real good friends and I believe i'll always love him no matter where i am in my life or who i'm with =) x|`|TrmGBloHaa	yes very ture and u can never forget your 1st love.|`|AA11989999	I don't even remember who that might have been. I fondly remember my first sex though, and I'd not mind seeing her again.|`|GoABmevnaa	To a certain extent yes,especially if they were your first kiss, sexual experience, etc. but if this first love happened at a young age I believe the older you get the more it should be "only a bittersweet memory" type of thing.  It's great to have memories like your first love, but as you get older and find somebody else your first love shouldn't effect you in anyway if that makes sense.
NxBYuOzbaa	Well, technically, you would be a virgin as your cherry would not be popped. <br>  <br>  I may sound "preachy" (not sure that's even a word, but you get me, I hope), but there's more to virginity than just sex. I think that if you want to wait for the right guy, then you should give him not only your body, but you heart and soul as well. You're virginity is a sort of purity that is not just broken by vaginal sex. I belive that having any type of sex (vaginal, anal, and oral sex) would mean your not a virgin, but that's just me. <br>  <br>  Also, there are two things you can do (and both will help you out):<br>  <br>  1. Don't do it, I'm pretty sure whoever the lucky man you marry is, will be more than happy to have anal sex with you.<br>  <br>  2. Do it, and experience things before mariage, then when you do get married, you'll have experience and you'll be able to share them with your hubby.<br>  <br>  I, myself waited, and I am very proud to say so, but sometimes I wish I would have tried SOMETHING before my hubby, not because I'm not satisfied, but because I wish I could do more for him, I mean when we got married I had NO CLUE what to do! I didn't know how to lay how to move, or NOTHING.<br>  <br>  Just think it out... and ask yourself these two questions: <br>  <br>  1. Will the man you marry consider you a virgin if he finds out you've had anal sex (remember, you don't know who or how this guy is yet because you don't know if you've met him)?<br>  <br>  2. Will YOU stop at anal sex, maybe after you do it you want to experience more?|`|ndZiyvWRaa	-I- would still consider you a virgin but a lot of people may not. Everyone has different views on what virginity actually counts as...<br>  <br>  Also, it shoudn't really matter. Are you worried that when you tell the world you have had anal, they're going to think you're not a virgin?|`|NXUqT45Daa	thoughts precede action. if one does not consider oneself virgin in thoughts ,succeeding actions are inconsequential. you are the best person to answer this question..for  you know your thoughts better..|`|GllB4mPZaa	Ho ..Ha ...Ha ...,,,ha...good question.Legally yes.Technically...No.Morally...u,know better.|`|DP9HbnrXaa	techniqally... you would still be a virgin because you havnt had it up the 'lady bit' and broken your hymen.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Unless a guy sticks his pen*s into your vagina... YOU ARE STILL A V*RGIN!!!|`|Nnk45e3Faa	dont worrie,your still a virgin................|`|bxlF3MEiaa	dont do it..it doesnt feel good...trust me.|`|hbcITsIbaa	Thats not so uncommon anymore.  I think its a pretty gray area.  Technically your a vigin but technically yoru having sex. I think its a good Idea I wish I had thought of it...|`|SGjhNidDaa	No, you wouldnt be a virgin.|`|JXrvbW7caa	Yes, you're still a virgin but you've already had "sex".|`|BbT3DCHvaa	I think you're a virgin until you have vaginal intercourse, so I would say yes.  And if you are getting someone online make sure they don't have any STD's or anything because it is easier to get them that way.|`|AA11097612	You would still be considered a virgin as far as vaginal sex goes but not a sexual virgin.|`|AA11289793	No thats defiantly 4th base stuff, so you wouldn't be a virgin anymore, but if you feel the need to experiment then go for it!|`|KJAKihaCaa	i do that. I call myself a virgin. cause technically you're still "in tact"
ai2qq3J2aa	who ever this gurl is dont trust her again cuz u said that gurl say she was kiddin maybe she went nd tlod ur friend that  she told u then maybe ur friend say go tell ur were kiddin
A7nIADxgaa	Yeah he might like you.<br>  <br>  It could have been that he's a good protective friend, but since you don't talk that much it's probably not that.
q1pwHXrMaa	He likes you....so now he is trying to distance himself because he doesn't want to have feels for someone he can't be with. <br>  <br>  Maybe he thinks by being abrasive it will make you not want to talk to him and therefor let the feelings between the two of you fade (not that I am implying that you have feeling other then friendship for him).<br>  <br>  What you need to do is be honest and straight forward with him. Let me know that you really value his friendship and find out if he's ok.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Zg2jwVpqaa	3 words..........HE LIKES YOU !!<br>  its obvious he is very unhappy at the fact that you are with your husband and not with him.He wanted to be the man in your lyf.and with u to being best frends (male & female)...... its not unormal for someone to grow feelings for other person.I wonder how long he has carried this anger round for tho ??<br>  Be straight up wid him no beating around the bush make sure he gets the message.but not to harsh that it effects ya frendship.He is becoming further away from you because, he is trying to avoid the feelings he has since u cnt be with him|`|DibzbnVhaa	Perhaps he wanted to be more than just friends and his mad about the fact that you are with him, that could be why he is trowing it in your face.<br>  He sounds like he had enough of the friendship and he does not consider it as valuable anymore.|`|1p67dpa9aa	it was probobly a misunderstanding... give him a call or meet him for lunch or somthing and tell him that you dont understand.... ask what happened, and be gentle... maybe he likes you? maybe he thought you did not want to hang out with him anymore so he"s ignoring you? maybe your "husdand" said somthing to him behind your back.... who knows?<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|YtDp0wjdaa	he is tellin u that he isnt married 2u and to back off some.|`|htWw0OlCaa	He might be starting to like you more than just a friend and wants more from you. Its probably getting to him that you are married to your husband and not being with him. I hope it all works out. Best wishes
feb5fa8fdcca36e21a7134de8b8fbc9faa	Sounds like to me your best friend probably had feelings for you and it finally pushed him over the edge but hey maybe it's something different; I'm just stating my thought.

They must be so desparate that they have to manipulate a girl of 16 to go out with them.  A sixteen year old clearly does not have the maturity level to handle 19 year old issues.<br>  <br>  Sorry, anyone eighteen and over who goes out with someone younger than 18 is not only desparate and sick, they are termed a pedophile in the eyes of the law.  Thankfully, most people do not need the government to make laws like this, how pathetic.|`|5bqKLMg0aa	Different states have different laws.
n6sMy0Ndaa	Time doesn't solve getting over someone. I was dating a lad for 2 and a half years and i split up with him last January. I'm still not completely over him but it's getting a lot better as I am happy with my partner now. It does take time but meeting new people and dating new people can make you happy. <br>  <br>  x|`|mtmBpFLZaa	Definitely yes, the first step of forgetting your ex is to date, and try to have fun and be busy.<br>  <br>  ask him what he's doing after school, when he says he doesn't know or 'nothing'. say "then you should take me out". <br>  good luck hope it works out for you|`|sPUOcQ21aa	i think its best if you take some time off and have some you time cuz tehn the next guy you date will be a rebound. and no one wants to be a rebound and thats not fair to the guy you're gonna date.|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	Dont use this guy as a crutch to get over your last. This would be called rebound.<br>  <br>  It is better to go on your own for awhile then date again later. <br>  <br>  How would the guy feel if he knew you were using him to get over another guy?
JyAlM18kaa	I'm having one of those days today.  Just want to hide, but unfortunately can't.

Either that, or I put on my IPod, close my eyes, and blast some music and just try to forget about everything and calm down.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	I ask my boyfriend for a hug, tell him what's wrong, and try not to dwell on it.  <br>  <br>  Although sometimes, crawling into bed and hiding until the next day is good sometimes too...|`|JkC7nj7laa	talk to my close friends i know i can trust about it, im having one of those days today =(
kGBli717aa	It's best to stay away as much as you can until you get over her. You are just going to torture yourself, it's hard on you any which way, but if you keep hanging out, these feelings will go on that much longer. Plus, if her boyfriend picks up on it, you're screwed. After a few weeks, you'll be over her (hopefully) then you can resume the friendship.|`|A7nIADxgaa	what else? Taking the time to forget her.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, I think you should tell her how you feel. Not only you might have a chance, but if she turns you off, you'll know she doesn't feel the same way and it should be easier to stop liking her. At least, it did for me once.
TkPJYlaMaa	Tell him how you feel|`|vtafeEIJaa	Thanks that people cares about you by looking at you.|`|B4RABc3saa	Well, rejection does suck. Still, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

If he stares at you for a longer time and doesn't look away, throw in a cute smile or even say "hi" to him and he will like the confidence you have. Some day's he may even say "hi" to you or look at you and smile back and may talk to you. Confidence is the key, also body language really does matter as well. Standing with your arms crossed, looking mad and not relaxed, chewing gum, and standing weird does kind of throws a guy off. <br>  <br>  I need to get back to cooking, if you have any more questions, please feel free to email me.

W0XoDxJraa	Oh hun, I know what you mean exactly. I've experienced it too and I didn't like it either- you really are not alone. Just think- these girls he is looking at are likely to be going home to their boyfriend who may be looking at other girls too! And then of course guys with girlfriends are going to be looking at YOU.<br>  <br>  I ended up bringing the topic up with my boyfriend in a non-challenging, mature way and simply, calmly asked him why he did. He told me that of course he was going to look at other women, but it wasn't in the way I thought it was. He said he looked at them the same way he'd admire a beautiful scene or a portrait at a gallery. they are pretty to look at so he looks at them. men are visual creatures, but he assured me he looked at them for this reason and not because he wants to jump in bed with the lot of them. Think about when yuo look at guys... you just like the view, right? It's the same with men. They look a girl up and down, think "Nice", and forget about her in a second. It's you he loves, you who he is attracted to above anyone (which is why he's with you!) and you he looks at in a loving way and looks at more than anyone. I know it's hard to understand because as wemen we're paranoid men loko at women differently to how we look at men...but they really don't. Both are meaningless admiring glances. And admiration of what, exactly? It is the admiration of a body a human walks around in. It's like a christmas present. Sure, the wrapping may be nice and attractive, but inside may be as ugly as hell! Too much time is wasted on jealousy- trust me I know!!- but try not to think about it. When yuo experience negative thoughts, shove them out of your mind. Repeat in yuor mind that he, like every man in the universe, likes to look at pretty female bodies. But he doesn't have any feelings for them as women. He has feelings for you!!<br>  <br>  think about the saying "If he doesn't look once, he's not a man. If he looks more than twice, he's not a husband/boyfriend". It is completely natural and normal to look once, and you'd probably be surprised at how meaningless that look is. It really is just an admiring glance and is forgotten about in minutes.<br>  <br>  What I try to do, even when I'm out by myself, when I see a stunning woman, instead of feeling jealous and try to judge her for flaws, I tell her that she looks lovely. As well as replacing jealous feelings with kindness, I also make another feel good about themselves.<br>  <br>  I doubt there is a woman in the world who hasn't experienced what you have at least once. But realise this isn't just your boyfriend who does this, it's every single man. It's just how they're wired and something that they deal with, and doesn't impact our relationship with them. Even if you don't try to understand it, if you at least accept it it will allow you to be happier. If you never try and get over this, I don't think yuo'll ever be truly happy.<br>  <br>  Trust him. He'd look even if he was with angelina jolie. A man doesn't need to go out for a hamburger (another woman) if he has steak (you) at home. But he can still drive past mcdonalds. (glance at other woman but not have any interest in them because his appetitie and heart is full)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and look after yourself. I answered this in a lot of detail because trust me, i've experienced what you have. Seriously- don't think about it after. Because he won't! He'll soon be checking out the latest sports news or whatever. :)|`|ZmRsyr6qaa	it's sooo understandable to be jealous. it's so hurtful. but maybe you should try just talking to him about it. just be totally honest and tell him how much it hurts.|`|BKr3y30maa	I'm not going to bash you.  All I can advise you to do is to tell yourself each time "he chose to be with me".|`|A5FMFVVaaa	i would only give him 1 more chance hes human he\we all make mistakes if u catch him ever again i would dump his ***|`|SimAO1IUaa	ugh thats annoying. i once had a friend and her boyfriend would always be like "did you see that girl check me out?" or "oh that girl wanted me!" and he always made it obvious when checking out a girl. it annoyed her soo much but there really isnt anything for you to do to get rid of your jealousy besides knowing that its normal for a guy to look at other girls vice versa, but YOUR the girl that he is going home with at night not them. and you could always confront him about it too if that may help<br>  <br>  ohh ya and i forgot to mention maybe he does it on purpose to MAKE you jealous all guys do that sorta thing girls too. and when she confronted her bf about saying "why do you do that to make me mad?!" he told her bc he wanted to see if she really cared about him bc he didnt think she did because she acted like she didnt care!.... boys do weird things|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Whats the question.
Deb4iqbvaa	Well, think of this: Most people have one best friend because you cannot have two. Someone is always left out, someone is always jealous, or someone is trying to win over one of the other two people. <br>  <br>  3-ways are the same, I'd guess. If you guys plan to go outside your marriage together for sex, I'd suggest looking into swingers parties or something, but discuss what's acceptable. Like "we only do this once a month, the rest of the time is just about us." <br>  <br>  Not something I'd venture into, but I hope this helps!|`|JD07o1ysaa	3-WAYS often cause problems in relationships, usually due to jealousy issues or one partner wanting the third party more often.( which was your case) I do not advise bringing a third party into the bedroom whether it be a man or woman, black or white :)|`|gjaPNWbTaa	By the time we actually did that we had done several foursomes with other couples.

It's cuckhold Thursday Val.|`|1epjqrflaa	And THAT is why I think 3 way's are probably a bad idea....

61WgRcntaa	Okay,<br>  This kinda thing has happened to me before, i know how it makes you feel. The best thing you can do right now, is confront the girl who didn't invite you to her party. Try not to get angry or upset at what she says and remember to be honest. Ask her why she left you out, and tell her how upset you are feeling now. If she chooses not to answer, or not to sort things out then i'm sorry but it'll be hard for you to be friends with her again, especially if the only way you can be friends with her is if you apologies for more things just to make her feel better, even if they weren't really your fault.<br>  If this is really getting to you, which i think it is, then try to move on and forget about her, tell yourself it's her loss, and you've done nothing to deserve this. To be perfectly honest if she's going to be like this, then she's not worth being friends with because she doesn't exactly sound like a very good friend at all.<br>  Hope things get sorted out somehow.<br>  Try not to be too upset :)<br>  x|`|HbraP1cpaa	Don't worry about her, she's immature- and obviously NOT a true friend. Just ignore it, and get over it.
4i62SCfIaa	maybe the girls u hang out with consider you just as a friend and not boyfriend material..<br>  if u like a girl that u hang out with then u should flirt with her instead of just talking..<br>  and thats good that ur being yourself!!!<br>  i hope everything goes well<br>  and good luckk!|`|3AXlgGgUaa	Personally, i wouldn't date a guy who had a million and one mates for a few reasons:<br>  1 - it seems that he doesn't have time for a relationship.<br>  2 - it seems that he has no need for a realtionship.<br>  3 - if someone gets along with everyone and doesn't have preferences that if he likes me, it isn't very special because he likes everyone!|`|8GLfmUVOaa	you seem lovely :)<br>  just tell the one you like how you feel :D

I'm loud too lol|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Well if it's not fake we like it cuz it means you are enjoying it as much as we are.

ar7ynJB8aa	Don't meet this boy first of all since he's saying all these inappropriate things. You don't want to associate yourself with bad people they're only going to bring down your life. Step away and back up from the situation. Just tell him you're busy or you're not ready to meet anyone yet. Anything would work. He should understand or get the hint and out of your face. <br>  <br>  Btw "he seems really sweet" is a lot different from "he is really sweet". <br>  <br>  Just because he knows how to manipulate his words to woo you, I don't think you should fall for it. ANY guy can say that you're special to him and that you're pretty. Remember that.|`|SimAO1IUaa	yeah i think you should definitely turn him down. even if he does seem really nice. i once had a friend who was going out with this guy because at first even though he was in a gang, he was super nice to her, always buying what she wanted and saying things she wanted to here that sounded genuine at the time, but sooner or later, he tried to pimp her out and started beating her and all this other stuff. not saying thats what he'll do, but if hes in a gang, im sure you can do better. its not hot|`|PfQJoAwraa	just tell him that you like him as a friend that's all for now(give him some false hope)
cMyPQ90vaa	well if he really cared and respected you than he shouldn't have left you because of you not sleeping with him and you should text him and say happy b-day to show him your the better person. good luck:)|`|vXa7IeDiaa	Its his B-day he could be busy..Just FYI men don't change if he dumped you for not wanting to have sex..he's probably coming around to see if you are ready to have sex yet..He sounds like a jerk..I wouldn't stress to much off this situation..let him go..he couldn't get sex from you so he left and went to get it from someone who would..typical a$$hole..angela simmons (rev run's daughter) was in your situation if u watch the show (daddy's litle girls on MTV) she was going out with TK the skater..and angela simmons said he dumped her because she wanted to wait till marriage to have sex..she was hurt..but men like that are just a$$holes..4get about this guy and move on wait till he calls you..or textes you..don't act like your waiting to get back with him..act like u did when you guys weren't talkin to eachother.Good luck|`|jgU4g6kGaa	I wouldn't contact him...if he was so insensitive of you back then to break up with you cuz you wouldn't give him sex then why give a crap what he thinks!!! If he cared about you back then he would have stood by your decision not to have sex and wait till you were ready he just showed that he didn't care and only wanted sex! Don't waste your time with this kind of person what makes you think he has changed you are only setting yourself up for more pain.|`|u8HYfTnyaa	he will tell you its his birthday, the fact that you remebered says somthing about you. if he says somting about your birthday then you can wish him a  happy one. but still go to coffee and listen.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Don't even give him the time of day. He hurt you once, don't risk getting hurt again. He's an ex for a reason and in your case, a very good one. <br>  You can do better.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	he will want to get back together with you which is the only reason why he contacted you|`|LJik2RjRaa	Firstly I must say that your not going out with anyone since he basically dumped you is YOUR responsibility. (I'm not shouting just emphazising.) I learned that myself only by going through it.<br>  <br>  Regarding the current situation he said he'd call you so it's HIS responsiblility to call you.  If he didn't bother wishing you a happy birthday over the past 12 months then you've ZERO obligation to wish him one.  He appears to be playing it cool, as a guy I advise you to act exactly the same way.  Delete all of his texts excett the one where he said he'd call you.<br>  <br>  And find or at least look for someone new in the meantime.|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	go ahead and wish him a happy birthday. usually i'd say guys like that will never amount to anything and are slobs that just need to be left alone... but some people do change... you can give it a try and see how you feel after the coffee...|`|9tqlD4vcaa	i think you should wish him a happy birthday.<br>  but it sounds like he was an asshole when you guys broke up, and<br>  maybe he realizes that he was stupid to make that decision.<br>  i think you should give him a 2nd chance|`|EoPZnFZlaa	Text him a simple Happy Birthday message, nothing else, and wait and see if you hear from him.  If he's interested, he'll call (or text)|`|0eNowNixaa	call him and say happy birthday and ask about the coffee thing. hes probably thought about how stupid he was for breaking up with you.|`|Uz3ZFAwcaa	I would call him up and say happy b-day... u know if you still aren't totally pissed at him :P and just wait for another invite for coffee I Guess. LOL sorry if doesn't really help u. =]|`|AA12265821	em i don't like the sound of him u wouldnt have sex with him so he dumbed u ! leave it don't text him ! u may be Curious but maybe find out from a friend or something...<br>  xo|`|65285bc5a0732b7b1d291ce31a793279aa	Well you should have given him sex. Sex is an important part of a relationship. Even if you didn't enjoy it as much as you would have liked, you should have found a way to pleasure him. Wish him happy birthday and go on with your day.|`|SdktvzA3aa	I think he was either drunk or lonely when he called.  Sorry to say, but I have done this before when I was drunk.  He was in the moment and felt lonely so he called you. The day after he probably realized that he had no intentions of following through with it. If you are really interested in knowing the truth, text him happy birthday as a friend and see if he responds...but remember getting your hopes up may cause you more pain by someone who has hurt you already.|`|VqDSacJpaa	I wouldnt go to coffee with him, or talk to him at all.<br>  You broke up for a reason, he treated you really badly.  You can find, and it wont be hard, a guy who treats like like to should be treated.  Don't settle, and don't let him fool you or give him another chance to treat you badly.|`|NHo0wFbcaa	you could have just had sex with him. No im only joking. <br>  <br>  I would say with him a happy birthday and see if he wants to hang out for some coffee. You must still have feelings about him to even ask this question.|`|1Bto3sZeaa	The real question here is 'how did he hurt you'?  You said he split from you because you 'didn't give him sex'.  Honestly, this may be going too far in assuming the worst of him, but he may be asking you out [again] because he may not have a g/f now, and might figure, well... you know... that it is his b-day, and typically, usually, guys like sex as a gift.  Get where I'm going with this?  I hope for YOUR sake that isn't true in the least, let's hope not.  You never know though.<br>  <br>  Back to my original question.  How did he 'hurt' you?  Hopefully not physically, if so, then don't give him the time of day.  Don't communicate with him, move on (and hopefully he still will as well).  If it was just, typical arguments, nothing extreme, then maybe going out for coffee, like you said  to 'see what he has to say', might not be the worst thing in the world at this point for you.  Besides, you do sound interested in knowing.  Up to you... I hope you choose wisely.  I hope the best for your future, and you sounds nice so I'm sure you'll find a guy who will treat you the way you should be treated when the time is right for you.  Good luck!
fYAjV0GGaa	Well, that sounds like a good plan to me. Go for it, Girl!
QfJAO638aa	Of course that's a great thing, especially after soo long of being together...most couples sex life goes dry after a few yrs but I think is great that both of u still love each other and have a good sex life,,,I been with my bf for 2yrs and we still have sex everyday at least once, if were tired or more...and we love it... theres nothing wrong with have sex alot with the person you love and if anyone else tries to tell u diffrent is bc thier just jelous n they wish they had that...well congradulations on your marriage and sex life hope you guys keep up the good work!!<br>           Good luck!!<br>  ~*Diamind*|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...2 to 3 times a day sounds great to me too sweetie...but then I'm a high libido sex guy as well.<br>  It goes without saying really....if you have the need for what you deem more then usual frequency of sexual behavior?...who's anyone to tell you that it's too much seriously?<br>  So long as you make it to work...get the kids off and back from school...keep an orderly house for the most part.....go nuts darlin!<br>  It's a great stress reliever too!.....have fun!...keep it safe anyways...what else?...Enjoy!!!
YzgCab38aa	what did you do? you did not put out. He wanted and wants you for sex only. You refused, so now he is waiting for you either to go away for good or feel bad, pursue him and jump on him and put out and beg him to have you.

You said no.  Now he is on to the next conquest.<br>  <br>  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sounds to me like he is a typical teenage boy who just is looking for a warm place to put his ****.  Since you stuck to your morals, and turned him down, he's not interested.<br>  <br>  And next time someone tries to make you do things you don't particularly want to do, I'd walk away right there.  I acted like that at 14, and it got me brutally raped.  Just saying...|`|sXidfK5vaa	No he's playing a game! What he's trying to do is get you to have sex with him by making you feel like you disappointed him. If he is truly your Friend then he would be regardless if you had sex with him or not.

How would you feel if he treated you this way after sex?|`|zGthY1Jeaa	whats with all the little kids on this site?? *sigh* u got used, it isnt that hard to figure it out. u led on the guy, and hes pissed cuz he didnt get any. u sound kinda simple minded and dumb to<br>  do stuff just cus he told u to. <br>  sorry truth hurts. ur stupid.|`|udqWAyzAaa	Girl, you followed your gut instincts and that was the RIGHT thing to do. It's ok to be young and explore the opposite sex, but YOU know your limits and you should always respect them. If this guy was really a good friend, he would not be ignoring you or acting in any rude way towards you just b/c you said no to having sex. He just wants to get some, and if he is as young as you are and very sexually active..he will probably have an STD by 16...you don't want to go that route do you?<br>  Honestly I don't think saying anything to him will help, he sounds like a jerk. Just be your same friendly self and he will eventually see (with some time) that you are a respectable girl-and a good friend.
xXa3eQOeaa	He's an ALCHOHOLIC!! He always has been, he always will be!|`|DlCcFu1eaa	He's alcoholic. And it sounds like he has internalized anger issues as well. I'd stay clear.|`|SsfnitjXaa	To each his own.  Better than someone having 14 kids and no means support.  Personally I would not find this man you talk about attractive nor would I get it in my mind that I could play social worker and turn his life around and make him happier.  I would walk away from him and never look back.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	He does have issues. And he does drink too much.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Gosh! I would not even drive in front of these people's house.
3wKGTZvAaa	This is one of those situations where you have to deal with it. We all have preferences over things and those are very hard to change. One thing you can try is to do things that she likes?? I don't know who she is or who you are so I can't tell you exactly what to do.
2ij4wwjgaa	she wants u she jus playin hard 2 get|`|aNJhRxvHaa	No means no. Don't be confused by her body language, she could just be a very flirty person. Or, if she is attracted to you, she's still saying no which means she isn't at the point of wanting to pursue anything with you.  Give it time, and if she is interested in you, you'll have <br>  more and more signals.  But don't assume, because for the most part, when a girl says no... she really means no.
Kyk1ficCaa	tell your friends you dont love this person and it really harsh on him, then go up to the boy and tell him that your relationship doesnt feel rght and that you were pushed into the situation and that you didnt want to hurt his feelings so you went out with him and that now you  feel that its  wrong going out with him, when you dont really love him.<br>  hope this has hemped good luckk x|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I would leave.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	I would get out of it, you cant base a relationship on false feelings its not fair|`|G5GsVtBcaa	That happened to me. The guy really liked me and I didn't want to date him nor be mean. I waited it out. When one of the poepl in the relaionship isn't into it, it fizzles out quickly.|`|57LFRfqCaa	I don't understand how you could be pushed to go out with someone and not know at the time.|`|L9oND2BXaa	Just tell them that ur not looking for anyone right now. simple, yet effective.
H6GIYDdzaa	I'm searching for someone I like who likes me back.<br>  <br>  That's all that matters to me and if the relationship doesn't work out then I'm gonna cut it off and carry on until I find someone who is compatible with me.<br>  <br>  I think there is always a person out there who is nearly perfect for you, I don't believe in fate or destiny so that's not it what I mean is that they are compatible with your likes, dislikes and overall personality and look at life.<br>  <br>  If you don't find someone who is great for you then you will regret it later on, that's how I see it.|`|fYAjV0GGaa	I know what I'm looking for-if I settled for less, I would be lying to myself. I'm not looking for an endless list of qualities, but there's a certain feel to the realtionship that I want. <br>  I guess I'm in the middle. I'm prepared to search the whole ocean if I have to...but I think that if you know what you're looking for, it makes it easier to identify, and more desirable to hold onto.|`|dltzzsCraa	You don't have to narrow it down. You will know exactly what you want when you see it. ;) i liked your question though, was sweet :)|`|B9OwRPSpaa	i think it's fate or love at first sight.|`|VrydDAJiaa	i often ask myself the same question what if your wasting your time on a person that isnt right for you and so u miss the right one?! <br>  im not so sure of the answer, i just think i want to be happy, and i can do that by myself so i dont necessarly need a guy to make me happy, so i can lead my life following how happy i am, so the right guy will make me more happy. you shouldnt be looking for anyone, maybe it just happens if it happens. thats my conclusion anyways! id like to think my mr right has a flashing sign over his head telling me but i dont think he will so maybe the answer is to not look and rather than discarding people or in your case not thinking about certian things like you say, social and political views etc maybe they arent important to you but other people they will be so thats how u find people. just an idea! good luck :)
ee5MawLdaa	Sounds to me like she wants a break up. But you proly know that. Well how about you buy her roses and some chocolates to sweeten her up? Is there something that you can improve on? now would be a good idea. . .|`|6mVpfmR6aa	You're getting into the difficult part of the relationship.  You will need to talk to her about what is taking place, and see if she even knows what it is.  Also, I would stop using the word forever.|`|SGjhNidDaa	she might be having a change of heart. but if you really love her, she probably loves you too. just give her a little space, and be alittle less available. let her come to you instead of the other way around, and she'll miss you and come around.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	You're in my boat and I am in your position. You have two choices:<br>  1. Wait until someday, which may never come<br>  2. Break up<br>  <br>  I have been with my man for a year and a half and he still isn't sure. Being unsure, isn't the same as not ready. Unsure, you don't see a future with the person. Not ready, is when you are sure you found the one, you're just not ready to get married.|`|JJMa25NWaa	If things are getting distant, you need to sit down and talk to her about it. Tell her you've been noticing some different behaviors in her and are just curious what it's all about. Ask her what's going on, if something is going on with her life that she needs to vent about or something. I dunno, good luck though|`|euwbbibZaa	sit down and bring it up to her. If her thought of forever has changed maybe their is a friend or family member that just went though a bad breakup/divorce that had her bummed out. Just talk with her and get your thought and feelings out but keep calm.|`|AA11776857	Hey! well, me and my boyfriend(now fiance) have been together for one year too and he tells me that we'll be together forever and i believe it. When you mean "forever" are you talking about wanting to marry her? If so, you have to talk to her and find out exactly why she's been acting that way. Part of a relationship is about communication. It's my understanding that she isn't ready to commit herself yet! You just need to talk to her and get to the root of the problem and find out if there are any ideas on how to better you relationship.|`|cuNdAE3Daa	you need to talk to her about it, she might be starting to feel as if it isn't working out for her and you'll need to try and be understanding how ever much it might hurt. the main problem though is more likely to be that your relationship is at a halt and you don't really do anything new together.<br>  hope i helped<br>  xx mwah|`|OKI7iiaOaa	Yall need to talk. & also she might be getting bored of you or something she might try to pull away dont let her do that. Just set down with her and be sensitive and sya what all is on your mind.|`|ymrbr5craa	It seems like something happened to her or she did something that she feels guilty about. Maybe you should sit down with her and ask her what is happening because you want to help her.|`|0eNowNixaa	just talk about whats going on with her. maybe shes just stressed//has her "."// or there might be more to the story shes not telling you|`|xtd2h5JTaa	I think she might of met someone else|`|DYBh8bo8aa	i am a girl and maybe shes on her month or shs cheating on u u should look for someone else or if ya ll did it then she might be pregnant dude have u thought that she might also need her  space Hello but be Strong if u love her|`|PPwsaeUxaa	Maybe she's just not into you anymore, bro. I had a chick I was head over heels in love with dump me the day before my birthday! How's that for sticking it in and twisting it? After a bit of introspection i realized I may have been a bit too clingy or even cutesy-cute. She decided to move on. Not sure really what to tell you, except don't let it get you jaded.<br>  All I can suggest (not knowing that much about it really from the little you've said) is to try to communicate with her. Then again, no one that's ready to move on wants the person their leaving to be the clingy, "Why are you breaking up with me?" person.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Communicate.|`|cFoBxLDVaa	It sounds like me and my boyfriend. It sounds like she getting bored of you. Give her some space, take her on a date or do something special first than don't hang out for like 3 ta 4 days tell her your hanging with your friend and doing other stuff than after the days are up take her some where to eat or something to catch up see what shes been doing and just talk to her.
6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Heck no.  If mine would have taken that much interest I'd still be married.  She wouldn't even let me do it.|`|JCdBSULraa	Supposedly only about 5% of women can get off through penetration alone.   Almost all women have to help themselves.  If a guy has a problem with that, he's got to get over it.  Ideally the guy should be doing his best to help you get off though, most of us prefer not to finish first.<br>  <br>  As for the sex drive, your husband might be gay or have erectile problems, I get off 2-3 times a day, and I don't think that's unusual.  I'm 25, and I've been that way since I was 11.|`|GoABmevnaa	this definitely turns guys on. every guy i've messed around with thinks it's really hot when you touch yourself...  haha so no worries, your husband probably loves it!|`|TrmGBloHaa	it is a big turn off BTW
AD5cue8Waa	that is life. girls are just as dumb and immature as guys they just hide it better. yeah they date assholes all the time then they wine about being played and abused. its messed up i know but you cant change it. find a smarter girl.|`|AA10857451	I'm so with you on this one. Could they just for once make up their minds.|`|AA11806027	women today don't know what they want,they can't see a goodman that's right in their faces.|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	me i always stick to the nice guys, and it seems that i always have the wrong idea about them, bcuz they always turn out to be jerks :(|`|z2eEgDk4aa	they don't. "nice" guys just don't make the move fast enough, and she doesn't know what going on between them.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	because they seem to sweet talk them in
lNlL0Ag2aa	Well I'll be 20 soon, but Personally, I like girls who shows as much interest as possible. <br>  <br>  Guys get turned on when they see girls they are interested in who show that they're into them, it's one of the best feelings in the world for us. I'm sure you girls feel the same way to see a guy expressing interest in you also.<br>  <br>   Otherwise, if we don't notice a girl we like expressing any feelings towards us, we get disappointed and start thinking that she's interested in someone else.<br>  <br>  So I think your guy friends are trying to ruin the relationship out of their own envy by telling you not to let the guy know you're into him. Show as much as possible because it will turn a guy on to know that his girl is attracted to him and him only. <br>  <br>  Smile at him and stare into his eyes and have that bright, confident, "I wanna get what I want" personality.
vOODVZbNaa	Don't tell a complete lie...you will have to say he was kicked out but maybe don't tell the truth about why he was kicked out if it was his fault.<br>  If its his parents who are in the wrong tell the whole truth...your parents might be able to help even if they disagree to letting your friend stay.|`|G0SvGeOWaa	Ok if your parents are big talkers (meaning they like to talk to people alot) or they are good friends with his parents (duh dont do it then) you have to tell the truth.<br>  <br>  BUT IF NOT: yeah like that girl or whoever said, say his parents had a really bad fight and his dad got really mad and blamed him for the fights they've been having and kicked him out.  And if they ask why, then say idk, he doesnt like to talk about his parents...|`|ouUti34faa	How about the truth? If his behavior was to blame, do you really want him treating your parents like crap too, or even possibly you? When you start living with someone, that gives you a completely different perspective on things. If you're mother has half a brain she won't even consider it because of all the liability. If his parents wanted to, they could have her arrested for kidnapping, and since their son is under 18 and it's your word against theirs (unless there's paperwork), she could go to jail for that. Let him fend for himself or find some other dummy to take him in. Besides, I'm sure his parents will let him come back home. Most do.|`|XQa3CQJ0aa	The best thing to do is tell the truth although it may not work...<br>  <br>  Explain to your mum that:<br>  <br>  'Hes having some family issues just now and he's really starting to get stressed, he's just looking for a place to stay until everything in his home calms down, he has no where else to go and he will help out with the housework. He wont be any bother he just really needs some space to be away from the trouble that is going on at home...'<br>  <br>  Say something like that atleast your telling your mum half off the stuff that is achaully going on except from the fact that he got kicked out.<br>  <br>  I've used this excuse many times on my parents. I'm 16 and it always works because I am telling them the truth but not telling them 'exactly' that they got kicked out.<br>  <br>  In the end his parents will no doubtfully take him back their maybe mad at him for something he has done and kicked him out because of thier anger. It all takes time...hopefully things will work out x|`|Fuy0SYQRaa	Mike's parents will go to jail for abandoning him.|`|4E6rrI09aa	you can say his parents are going on vacation or they had a disagreement & he needs space or hide him in your closet (:
Uj5kuzoJaa	YEAH!!!!! Question is, do you swallow or spit. Only wimps spit it out!|`|nmk73mnGaa	im already with my dream guy, and yea i already do =]|`|iTf0l9Wlaa	yeah i give my boyfriend bj and theres nothing wrong with that. and he loves it|`|ooJC99gmaa	yes! i give my bf a bj alot. :)
DibzbnVhaa	Ask about his day or talk about how your day was, you could also find an online game that you would both enjoy playing, that should take some pressure off the conversation.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Say something about boobs sex or something that makes you sound sexy. He won't lose interest.lol|`|fdd4f52564cecf4c89be8850165a31b7aa	talk to him bout stuff that he likes and see if u can relate or even say u like the same things|`|LETd2hQwaa	Well its been my experience that talking to guys online will eventually head in that territory because guys are visual lovers. They like to see and touch what they have so... uhhh find a guy off line or (I REALLY DON'T WANNA TELL YOU TO MEET THIS GUY OFF LINE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE SITUATION AND THAT'S USUALLY NOT SAFE BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT).|`|PZ6uBiHEaa	Nothing, ignore him for a few days :D make him want you.|`|794eeb906c2eeff6ec45d9217ea0ebaeaa	trying new things
LpFKDXQFaa	first of all, sorry that your friend you thought you trusted told your crush you like him<br>  2nd you cant be so scared. act like hes your best friend. if you act really scared, hes gonna think your prude and thats deff not a turn on for guys. i guess you can try to make small talk with him like face to face, but another good idea if your to scared or nervous is next time you hang out with your "bestie" obv she has his number so text him....at first act like its your bestie talking but then randomly be like heyy its elizabeth on besties phone. then just start talking to him. maybe he will get your number and you can text him when ever. that way you guys will be more comfortable around each other. try to talk to him during school. also try to flirt with him a lot!!!!!!!! but just remeber.....DONT BE SCARED! just go with the flow and keep your cool! you will do fine!<br>  <br>  :)|`|Tmusgqbmaa	if u dnt no him, how u hav a crush on him? well anyways i would go up to him and just ask him out|`|seqEdwwnaa	if he doesnt know who you are...that means you guys havent ever talked before.....then how can you like him??|`|9YsIXUzJaa	danm girl get a diary|`|yI9pFCudaa	lol @ first answer :L|`|rRZA8nPTaa	be confident and just go ask him to go grab lunch or something|`|a2O4qDpnaa	Don't worry so much. Things like this either work or they don't but the only way for it to work is to be patient and give it time. Which is probably the last thing you want to do, but the best. Just say hi to him when you see him at school, he knows you now so he will say hi back, maybe sometime ask him what class he has next if he likes it or not what teacher he has, small talk. eventually maybe he will ask you some questions and you will get to know him, and he might start to like you and want to go out with you. Don't let him know that you are completely crazy about him, this will just scare him away no guy wants to hear that. Just chill out, relax, and take it slow like you are the coolest girl in the world and he would be crazy not to want you!|`|c1iopYwbaa	Well, i had an expeience like this before.. well just try to talk to him and get to know him by maybe when your "bestie" is talking to him and they are hanging out go over and join the conversation. But dont act to obsessive just talk to him every once in a while and just get to know eachother also your bestie doesnt sound like a bestie very much like my best friend would try to hook me up with the guy knowing that i liked him but okk. well i hope this helped . i bet you'll get the guy by no time !:]|`|mvVDeL5uaa	you should get to talk to the guy on your own. maybe you could walk up to him say hi and start a conversation ask him the stuff he like or hang out with him at lunch or maybe even in the classroom. when he notices you he will probably start talking to you everyday and then ask for his number or myspace or aim or email address so you can continue talking and ask him does he like you and then everything else will build up|`|xrULvzbOaa	It sounds like your friend isn't being much help. :( That is lame. But, I would just be yourself. As hard as it may be to be yourself around him, I think that is what you need to do.  Tell your friend to back off, because she isn't helping at all.  She's making it really awkward for you and him because she keeps dragging you over. Just say hi to him when you see him and don't act too excited to see him. Just a casual "hey, how's it goin" would suffice.  Do you have any classes with him? If you do you can talk to him in there.  Just get to know him through your casual conversation. It will take a while for you to make an impression on him, but don't get impatient. If he hardly knows you, don't jump straight to 'going out'. Get to be his friend first and then go from there. Maybe your friend could set up a double date with you and her and him and one of his friends... it would be less awkward that way and then you could get to know him more. Just go on a casual date or just go hang out before you jump to 'going out'.  If you're friends first, you wont freak him out by wanting to go out with him.|`|I2xILJtraa	just talk to him more and pretend that day never happened|`|vJ6GI7oIaa	Do you expect people to understand what you've just written? Dear God, that was painful. Take some extra English lessons - that might help. I'll take my head out of the noose now.
mJo35PwXaa	He likes u ask him out|`|dF5GtaHSaa	god come on<br>  just go talk to him and ask him y does he do that<br>  or just go and say that u like him too<br>  go tell him <br>  if u r wrong about him then it's ok we all get wrong signals|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	you sure he only does that to you?  maybe he could see that you like him from the look on your face.  next time stand in front of him and stare at him on purpose, then smile, then walk away.  he eye fu you, now you mind fu him.
kvmWDuOJaa	Yeah, he likes you! I doubt he would have initiated a conversation on Facebook if he wasn't interested in getting to know you, and with all the other things you have said it makes it really seem like he's into you!<br>  <br>  The nect step woul probably be flirting with him.<br>  Little things like making eye contact when you talk to him, getting a little closer to him (physically) than you usually would, meeting his eye from a distance then smiling and looking away, seeming like you have a genuine interest in what he is saying, etc, will make him think "wow, maybe she likes me". Doing that will make him even more interested and more determined to make a move and get to know you better.<br>  Check out sites like these for flirting tips:<br>  <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/flirting-tips-for-girls-how-to-flirt-with-a-guy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/flirting-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.links2love.com/teens_flirting_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.links2love.com/teens_flirting...</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Flirting-Tips-For-Girls---Top-10-Flirting-Tips-That-Really-Work!&id=914897" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Flirting-Tips-...</a><br>  Flirting him rather than just telling him you like him straight out will make him much more eager, and will be a lot more fun!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!

The best way to possibly figure out if he likes you is to become friends.  Not necessarily become the best of soulmates tomorrow, but slowly talk to him more and more.  I'm a guy, and I did that with a girl I liked, and it's going great.  Good luck!|`|JsSuqJqJaa	He likes you girl!
03GQ637Raa	First, do you have a neighbor or relative that can help with the food preparation?  If not, then the only other thing I can suggest is to buy some frozen dinners and canned dinners.<br>  Canned dinners would be canned ravioli, pork and beans, corn beef hash etc..  Buy some hot dogs, hamburgers and ready to eat chicken.  Always keep the heat from medium to low when cooking the hot dogs and hamburgers.  Then go out to eat if you all can afford to.  Don't be nervous.  Just be positive and think before you do or cook anything.  Get some lettuce, tomato, onion, green peppers, for salad.  Buy frozen vegetables.  If you have a microwave, just follow the instruction for heating and cooking items.  Oh yeah, don't forget the junk food smile!!  email me if you need some more help.|`|1t3Yre2Haa	:( never is too late to learn something

b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	I remember it was around 12:00 MIDNIGHT! And it was raining sonce 10:00 that night. Well I was just getting out of the car from going out to dinner and we were fooling around in the rain, jumping in puddles. Well my house wasn't that far so I started to run cuz I was soooo happy and he ran after me and when I got to my lawn it was ALL muddy and I slipped back and knocked him over. We fell on our sides and we stared at each other for about 1 min and stated laughing. Then we stared and he kissed me in pouring down rain.

We were outside talking and he was being really sweet, and he got in front of me and he had his hands on my sides, and he looked at me in the eyes, and kept talking && he said something funny, and i kind of giggled and i looked down, and then he took one of his hands and lifted up my chin and he just had this serious cute look on his face and kissed me, it was so sweet ;)<br>  I love him =D<br>  He's still my boyfriend now, we are now 16 and I will ALWAYS remember that night.|`|izueNNhuaa	First kiss was with my boyfriend when I was 12. I was just leaving from his house and we were walking along his street, delaying the time he would have to turn around and go back home. I saw a cat on the side of the street, and I bent down to stroke it. When I stood back up, he was closer than I expected. He leaned in for our usual simple peck on the check, but I smiled and held his eyes. Slowly, we both leaned in and kissed on the mouth. We parted our lips only slightly. We really had no idea what we were doing, but it was very sweet. I walked off, with a quick goodbye and had to force myself not to skip down the street, singing aloud.<br>  <br>  My best kiss was at a party. We'd started off by playing spin the bottle, but it quickly got out of hand. I ended up snogging this guy on a sofa. He was really good, and god, he knew how to use his hands. We made out for, like, 15 minutes before we realized everyone was staring at us and had stopped kissing. It was embarrassing, but we were both so amazed. I felt dizzy, actually. It was the first time a kiss had made me feel properly dizzy. And it was great.|`|WwOCNY27aa	it was at my cousins graduation party with a boy who was there and we hung out the whole day because we had previously met at a wedding since our families are like close and then we just ended up kissing(: and it was my first kiss and he's been my boyfriend for 8 months this friday(:|`|MmdWM51faa	my firsy kiss sucked but my second kiss was on a snowy day outside of school and we were going outside to the buses and he just kissed me we didnt go out but i liked him a lot <br>  he was aggressive and it was so sexy<br>  he took my head and kissed me!!!!!!!|`|11828c71068f8d346742bd68e2456376aa	AWWW My first kiss was actually under the moon on New Years.. it was awesome i will never forget it.. LOL it still gives me butterflies in my stomach :D aww the good ol days
34b40Vu3aa	C, but when she tells her dad she needs to make it very clear all the things she has heard, he needs to know how inappropriate his behavior is.  She should still tell her mom even if her dad doesn't.  All you can do is be supportive.  I recommend she talk to your school counselor as well.  They are professionals and it will help your friend to talk to someone that is only in it for your friend's welfare and protection.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	A) MYOB - you have no idea what your parents relationship is or isn't...<br>  <br>  B) Do it and suck it up kiddo - you'll be out of the house soon enough...<br>  <br>  C) MYOB - refer to A|`|nwcmRFNzaa	She needs to talk to her dad and tell him what she is worried about. It maybe she has taken things out of context, She is not involved in her parents relationsip and is unlikely to have an understanding of  it. Mind you I am not sure why she is reading her fathers text in the first place!|`|lyWSufFBaa	Tough situation. I know you want to be there for your friend but getting involved with her situation is only going to put stress on yourself.  Let her know you are there for her to talk to and whatever she decides to do (and the decision has to be hers) you will be there for her.  It's an adult situation so no child should ever have to put themselves in the mix of it.  If he is in fact cheating, eventually the truth will surface.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	you tell her to say nothing ,,,,,  and stay out  of parents things,, listen in to conversation,, texts   is she a spy at 14... she you cause more trouble than it worth ...
xXkoVL06aa	Well that's a tough situation..but based on what you've told..it sounds like he just has a way with words..maybe he only said those things because he wanted a fight from you. there's a chance that it didn't exactly reflect the way he feels. If he actually said "okay, i don't like you anymore" without emotion then he's not worth your time. someone who really likes you, should want you and only you and should be willing to fight for you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps : )|`|yuazwopdaa	your right sayin u dont wanna share cuz no one should have to share anyone forget him and get over it find someone new and respectable he is just tryin to play both of u two and it seems like its workin so just dont fall for his game he is a cheater and he dont care what ur feelings are as long as he has two girls posibly more i even bet he is braggin to all his lil' buddies too|`|VKbSyF2oaa	I think you should decide if you want to out with a guy that could possible cheat on you and flirt with other girls.
SDADmiARaa	I WOULD JUST GO ALONG WITH IT AND THEN IF U 2 R ALONE THEN JUST SAY HOW U FEEL|`|H6GIYDdzaa	You ignore it, if you don't actually like him then you shouldn't care.<br>  <br>  If you act like this then he is only going to get the wrong signals from you.
hXSSCFZIaa	The best thing to do is just tell them how you feel.  I hate it when people are like that too, especially when it's in front of kids.  It's so rude.  <br>  <br>  What you could have said about the cookie dough thing is "yeah, I would love to buy some, but I really can't afford it right now.  I'm sorry."  It's that simple!  Honest, to the point, but not rude.  The same with the flyer-ing thing.  You can just say "I'd love to help distribute flyers, but I'm not sure I'll have the time to put out very many." or "I don't think my husband's co-workers will be interested in that type of thing."  <br>  <br>  When your aunt and your other family members who do this to you are alone, or just when their kids are not around, you should tell them they shouldn't ask you to do things in front of their kids because then if you can't the kids might be disappointed.  If you feel comfortable doing so, you should come right out and tell them they shouldn't volunteer you to do things or assume you will do or buy something--especially in front of the kids.  Kindly tell them to please ASK in the future, NOT when the kids are standing right there if they want something out of you or from you.  Good luck.|`|PTshTOSUaa	its very inconsiderate. it seems like you have never stood up and said anything ever so you need to. or else the rest of your life is going to be like this.|`|seqEdwwnaa	grow a backbone...stand up and say how you feel about the whole situation....you do what you want to do...not what others are telling you to do|`|CeylRxK4aa	yuck - I Don't think it's ok - definitely inconsiderate.  Ok, since you haven't told these ppl off yet, i will assume you want to go the nice route:   the best thing is to be honest and tactful so as to not piss ppl off since you have to see them on a regular basis:  <br>  <br>  The cookie dough incident:  a good response "Hon, I would really like to support your cause, and I'm really glad you are involved, but we just can't do it right now"  - It's never rude to turn down a fundraiser if you can't afford it or can't use anything they are selling.<br>  <br>  The sing-o-gram incident:  Take the flyers, smile and say "I'll do my best."  <br>  <br>  The volunteer u babysitter:  I think this is really obnoxious, but if you want to be polite - stick to the truth "oh, I hadn't planned on anything like that, we're not really set-up for guests and have plans"  (they don't have to know your plan was with your TV and couch)<br>  <br>  ugh.  good luck!!!
seqEdwwnaa	stop it...if shes only in it because she feels bad for you...then thats the wrong way to become friends in the frist place|`|TqOsXq8Oaa	STOP THE FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE IF SHE BECAME YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE SHE FELT SORRY FOR YOU THAT'S NOT A REAL FRIEND|`|T5QUIDLlaa	u should 1st talk to her about the problem in ur relationship. <br>  try and fix it, but if she becomes mean and nasty to you dont bother being her friend anymore. <br>  no one deserves to be mean to <br>  dont be mean to her though. <br>  be calm|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	pity friends are nowhere near real friends and will usually stab you in the back when you need them the most. drop this leech and find another friend. they're not hard to find if you can get to know people.
I2c4i9Joaa	try and act tougher than me. i can't help but laugh and i love it.|`|JCdBSULraa	flirt and/or hug|`|2L6wM3aWaa	gargle my balls
dpOJwPJbaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  Just wear boxing gloves to bed.|`|4EWCegiRaa	When it comes to masturbation, I find it's a mind-over-matter type of thing.  Just like you have to fight your urge to punch a jerk in the face, drive your car 120 mph, and quit your job when you want to take a nap, you just have to put your mind to it.|`|Gdh0W0yLaa	I really suggest u join this site :<br>  <a href="http://stopmasturbating.wetpaint.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stopmasturbating.wetpaint.com/</a><br>  or at least have a read through it, especially the stories sections, but i urge u to join, its a growing site with people that want to stop.<br>  its hard to stop by urself, so why attack it alone?|`|Dsgpsbndaa	Maybe  your worried about something .... <br>  masturbation is also a good way to take out frustartion...<br>  so just find something else to occupy your time.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	That's awesome!|`|pVaZty4Maa	ewwww, u need counseling|`|dBo5kbRzaa	Thats kinda strange. Are you sure you weren't molested or anything cuz I can't see anyone doing that since 9 and not be mentally stable. You should talk to somebody. You have no shame if everybody sees you do that and the fact you cant do it discreetly says a lot. Talk to somebody a counselor or therapist.|`|4GpIlLCLaa	is  not gross, <br>  U Feel good when u do it, don't u so just carry on with it when u older and have a boyfriend u don't have to do it anymore<br>  <br>  and most of those people who say they don't do it ,  do it trust me|`|TmDabvoIaa	i feel your pain.<br>  it sounds horrid but speak to your doc for advice, he'll point you in the right direction to get help, dont feel bad tho, you cant help getting those thoughts.<br>  its an addiction.|`|r3O9XCSBaa	There is nothing wrong with masturbating. But it wrong to do it in class. Just make yourself wait until you go to the bathroom or go home.|`|1mvW2PHPaa	It is very good! look here <a href="http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/</a> and relax!!!|`|3WfNL41yaa	Get a partner, that helped my addiction x|`|TSoWL7SIaa	TWO WORDS- GET LAID!|`|uuh9VEhcaa	Eeew I bet you smell icky!|`|U0BMeOCGaa	ummm honestly, ask the nurse at school when she come for the sex lesson, and say it jokily but she shld answer sensibly. Otherwise got to your doctors, or think of something distusting when you want 2 masturabate.<br>  <br>  haha thats funny, sorry.|`|giLPAuHjaa	WHOOOOW! :L Ok I have never heard of a girl masturbating where ever she pleases and sounds kinda like somthing a boy would do or sombody that its sexually fustrated, maybe a trip to the doctors and their advice might be a big help! :)|`|Kc47dxxIaa	what the f**k?! go and see a Psychiatrist, it looks like you need big help!
q5Hd3lodaa	You should try slapping him then see who's boss, or maybe a he has a fork up his butt! Here's another, kick his butt. Okay just joking, he's probably just on the sensitive side, or probably has a bad day.|`|XQa3CQJ0aa	Im 16 and my best friend James acted exactly the same way. The reasons as to how I found this out was because:<br>  <br>  'He started crying all the time even in school and out of school and they were achaul tears!'<br>  'He started spending alot of his time locked inside his room and refused to talk to anybody even me!'<br>  'I started to try and break into the wall that he had built around himself and realised that he was very senstive but there was achaully something that had happened that was making him act this way... a reason that I can not repeat...'<br>  <br>  There must be a reason behind him crying mostly he is being very sensitive but something may have happened that is really hurting him and he is trying to get your attention by crying all the time...or maybe there is a possibility that he is gay and he doesn't know how to show it through himself...<br>  <br>  Talk to him and make sure he knows your there for him if there is achaully a problem, don't jump straight into asking her but built up to it by comforting him and telling him its ok he doesn't have to cry, and slowly progress to asking him if there is something that is making him cry...<br>  <br>  I hope things work out x|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Hey, I really want you to take him aside one day and try to see if you can help him by asking questions, I don't think it's normal to cry all the time, you should see what else is troubling him, maybe you can help him with good advice.|`|ditpL4YBaa	Possibly a medical issue, or maybe he is going through something that has nothing to do with you that is causing him to be so sensitive. <br>  <br>  You could try to apologize and perhaps he will tell you what is bothering him.|`|6wZ6tZtBaa	he's not gayy.<br>  he's probably just a little on the sensitive side.<br>   ;)|`|PxcEAoBMaa	I really don't want to be mean, but he might be gay.<br>  <br>  Still, there are sensitive guys out there that aren't gay. They are rarities though.|`|1rM65cQdaa	just because he cries doesn't mean he's gay.<br>  stupid bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i6WVPncnaa	Yes, the guy usually makes the first move.  Take some ignititive and make the first move.  I was shy too, but I liked this great guy and I asked him out.  He was too shy and now I live with him and are planning to be married in a couple of years (bad economy).  If I did not make the first move, we would not be together today.  If you like him so much, make the first move.  You never know unless you try.  Good luck.
vrIQNPZhaa	if u like him go for it, he does like u even if he can talk to but (i think u said) that his friend is bitching at u and saying mean things like "ur gunna be a loser for the rest of ur life" or something like that, do u really want to be with someone like that when their best friend talks to u like that
eybHcHz9aa	My boyfriend went on holliday with his (long term) ex present. She was his ex, so I trusted him.<br>  A) She dumped him, and B) he was with me...which told me two things.<br>  She didn't want him and that after three years it was safe to assume he was happy with me.<br>  He and his ex were friends for a reason, who am I to stomp on that? Especially since he's never given me any reason not to trust him.|`|E23s2wSNaa	wow i wish i had that much trust with my girlfriend, wow!!! thats crazy! ok ill calm down<br>  <br>  to be at ease, u should go out too! have some fun with ur friends! anything, spend the night at a friends house<br>  <br>  ---------------------------------<br>  <br>  or go with him, if he has a problem and gets angry with u or anything, than thats a problem, since my ex is coming back, i want to hang out with her, and i offered my girlfriend to come with me because i care about what she feels, from experiance like that i would think ur man would feel the same way i do if he cared|`|2vhXqnJzaa	He's a insensitive pig if you ask me, my hubby would have cancelled as he would have put my feelings first. Whether you can trust him not isn't the issue for me its the fact he clearly hasn't thought how this will make you feel.|`|GkPeIQ9Maa	Sadly, you will not be able too.. So.. What you can do is hang out with friends while he's away to keep yourself distracted until he comes back home..|`|JzdslIkDaa	If you are asking you are uneasy|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Why are you not going with him is what im wondering.|`|PY51kBTjaa	try and go with him. i would not feel easy if i was in your situation too!|`|nmC7qgtZaa	woohhh sirens going off there I wouldnt allow it unless you were there aswell|`|iAKIgFsoaa	Poor thing.Do NOT trust him. He is a man and has been with the ex. for some reason...|`|AA11114662	Crikey<br>  <br>  why would he even go on a holiday with his ex and not you???? she is trying to get him back|`|e6350c5a0d091ac21f7312543a652b22aa	why dont u go with him to keep a eye on him|`|UT2tv5N3aa	its all down to how much you trust your boyfriend and if you are asking this then not a lot so sit down and talk with him tell him how you feel maybe then you may feel better but you have to trust him otherwise there is no point of the relationship its what a good relationship is based on <br>  <br>  good luck|`|fox5a3ePaa	I would feel uneasy as well. I wouldnt allow this|`|EcQeNu3raa	The only thing you can do is trust that he wont do anything. Or go with him. If you can't go with him, Then find something else to do to occupy your time until he gets back. However, he should also make himself available when you call him, but don't go calling every hour. You sitting around worrying about it will not stop it from happening (if it were to), and will only stress you out.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	my bf wants to take a trip to cancun mexico... i told him he would go single and come back single because i was not going to accept this. i been with him for 3 years and he gets upset when i go to a club with my friends and he thinks its ok to go to cancun?! he must be kidding me. but i understand were your coming from...i would be upset and even try to go to the trip with him lol.|`|06O8FaOjaa	I WOULDNT TRUST HYM BECUS HS GNA BE IN A HOTEL WITH HS EX GF|`|YaB5bpv7aa	DUMP HIM
OZmn1n5qaa	Give it 15 minutes, you will like her again and want to have sex again, lol.|`|eUOmecaqaa	I got one word for yah bro... "shallow" LOL nah really I kinda know what you mean. But hey... I personnally only feel that way whenever I kinda "settle" yah know? try bagging someone you really got the hots for.|`|mvVDeL5uaa	that is a hard question to answer. probably because you lose interest fast or maybe you was just sexually interested in her.|`|VbMjHUDiaa	it might just be you had the sexuall erge at the time, but after, you found out your really not that attracted to her.|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Most of us guys are like that. I think it has something to do with built up hormones. After the release, we just want to be left alone.....or go round 2!|`|78zLeWLSaa	typical, they dump a load and forget your name|`|ppQbFWbWaa	'cause your a dickweed?|`|cmEi3CVqaa	you arn't ready for a relationship? don't make it a habit, you'll get a reputation.|`|VrydDAJiaa	because you dont pick the right girls to get with! maybe you should think more carefully about who your getting with and u wouldnt be in that situation! <br>  or you dont want a relationship? or you just want to get laid and dont consider the girls feelings? maybe you should think about your actions and what the girls want, try not to hurt people on purpose. remeber Karma- what goes around comes around!<br>  i hope you find a girl you like and not just before you ***! <br>  if you mean your just not interested straight after you *** then maybe its cause u wanna chill out, and have some time out. i that case you just need to find a girl that understands you!- although maybe thats the thing in both cases<br>  you need a girl that understands you and maybe u need to get a better understanding yourself of what you want.<br>  good luck :)|`|MxHRjPFHaa	its because thats all you want sex or a fun time....you want no relationship at this time...just pain fun and there's really nothing wrong with that at all as long as the female knows thats all you want|`|jlIiv0jTaa	Like the top guy said just move on in your life :)|`|258mrT2Paa	move on then.
KstuZJj8aa	yea, she'll prob do it again. and of someone cheats on you, it means that they don't have any respect for you (that is actually from a magazine, so its true), and even if she doesn't, she will always have wandering eyes which will just make u paranoid all the time. dump her!|`|tMxz63BDaa	i think she would cheat again if shes with the same guy<br>  but if shes with someone else she could change|`|37M3dkkRaa	no. i cheated on my ex with another guy and that was over 2 years ago, and i will NEVER do it again because it made me feel so bad, not a cool thing to do at all.|`|Kvajun9yaa	um maybe!|`|4E6rrI09aa	i had chances to cheat & one chance I could have easily taken but it's something I could never do when I'm in a relationship. I just COULDN'T  kiss that person because something stopped me inside (not that I wanted to cheat in the first place:) so if it's done once it could be done again..but maby people can change?|`|6iCOMx8laa	Once a cheat, always a cheat. I believe that goes for either gender. Everyone I know who has cheated has done it more than once.  I'd say 99%|`|0PkFuZMwaa	if she's not getting the attention she want oh yes she's going to keep cheating 95% sure for most anyway.|`|ye675T8aaa	yes if she did it the first time she wud do it again
9f44Wsz0aa	Both ways are find. If you are outgoing in social settings, then yeah, you have a good social life. Having good friends that you mingle with all the time is no different. If you are happy with meeting new people every time and that's it, then no problem with that. I think it  shows you have good social skills to do that. I don't have the guts to do that. I wish I could, because then I would probably have a social life. All my good friends are in other cities, therefore I don't talk to anyone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It takes time to find quality friends. Don't shy away from developing friendships, because then you will probably miss out on some very nice people that could turn out to be great friends. Just take your time as with any relationship and get to know people. You will know who to trust and who not to trust. But give each person you meet a benefit of a doubt. Just keep a watch on who can be potential friends. And the people who are shady, you can get rid of quickly. We can't avoid getting hurt in the world, you just have to know how to deal with it. Good luck.
37M3dkkRaa	i know im a girl, and one of my guy friends tried that crap one day and would NOT get off of me and i had to kick him in the nuts, hit him in the face and in the ribs...let's just say we're not friends anymore after that.|`|aGXankr2aa	Only if in a relationship - don't believe in friends with benefits.  I know some people that have made it work, but more in which its ruined the friendship.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	i'm not a guy... buuut yeah that'd ruin it.<br>  you can't just try to have sex with her if she's not flirty and you guys haven't even hooked up by just making out, she'd be pised.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Yes. and Yes.|`|UeUymAjwaa	its called **** buddies......obvioulsy one of u or both might get emotionally attached or feel jelous in the future.....dont do it unless you wanna date her.......but of course if she is a good friend I am sure u to can work it out as friends after the relationship is done|`|SQwyJQniaa	Most likely it'll mess up your relationship but having a sexy bestfriend can be a good thing because she most likely has friends, which is even better for you so take the L on this one girl and get with her friends.|`|618b763bcbdec675a22a2a35212b1e29aa	i would be trying to have sex with her,to hell with the best friend deal,go for it.|`|JyAlM18kaa	I'm not a guy, but if she's your best friend, then don't act like a dog.|`|utGddhnVaa	it'd be ruined if you just did it for sex I think. don't do it unless you want to make it a lasting relationship|`|AcARmgG1aa	dont doo itttt<br>  <br>  stay best friends, trust me, its much better. cos once deep feelings get involed its a lot harder in every aspect.
C8DOT8Y7aa	It's all about confidence! Maintain the attitude that she is lucky that you like her (make sure you are smiling, and in a nice way)--and if she doesn't see that she is lucky--well, there are plenty of girls who will. If you are not that confident, or you are shy, you should work on this dilemma by trying the ideas with some girls who are not your special crush. Learn the process with some nice girls who are friendly, and are not too scary. <br>  Work up to that special one when you have had some good results with this process (and feel like it). Having butterflies in your tummy, and a catch or shake in your voice is fine; just don't give up or fall back just because it makes you feel shaky: that is actually a sign that she is impressive to you--tell her that she impresses you if you want to. Be prepared to tell "what and why" you notice her (to show that you mean it)... <br>  Compliment her: Tell her she has a beautiful smile or beautiful eyes, but do not say something that is not true. And--don't say them one after the other! (It is highly recommended that you must talk about other things before complimenting or else it feels awkward) <br>  Girls like it when boys try to defend them when someone makes fun of them or threatens them. However, in other settings like a workplace or college, these things would rarely occur. <br>  In most cases, if you pick on her and pretend you hate her, then she will never like you. She'll think that you do not like her, so she won't like you. <br>  Girls feel at home when you talk to them honestly and openly, so try doing that. <br>  NEVER say to a girl that she is hot, it might make her very uncomfortable--like an object; say she is pretty or beautiful instead. <br>  Give her your phone number, MySpace, IM, etc. when you know each other well enough. <br>  If she asks if she looks bad or stupid, say no, NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK. Never pause and think though that makes her think your lying <br>  Don't talk about just boy stuff like the details about football or something else in which she's show no interest. But don't talk about really girlie stuff either or else she'll think you're gay. Try finding a neutral zone to talk about what kinds and why she likes movies, cars, foods, animals--see which ones of those she likes, ask "how" or "why not," etc.--and school, her friends (mostly) or straight music (not really weird stuff) or anything like that. Just let her set the pace and get her started and you listen closely. Listen twice as much as you talk. Show an interest in her interests--ask questions--like "who or what", when and where, "how or why"--but don't interrogate her like a spy--or like it is a fill-in-the-blank test. Be casual about it. Let it work, let if sorta flow naturally... from one thing to another. Ask about things that you like, but not to just argue! Don't be too picky (hard to get along with) or too silly (and don't grin too much...). Be more natural... relax a little, but lean toward her a little bit, and be open to her ideas, to show interest. <br>  When you have walked her to her destination, after you say goodbye, look into her eyes and smile. Look deep, but don't stare for too long.|`|Kyk1ficCaa	you could ask how her day has been so far, what class has she got next, there are plenty of questions you can ask. just relax and dont tense up cuz she will sense that and think your strange :] gd luck x
xrULvzbOaa	You can't tell him you've changed unless you actually have changed. You wanting to break them up kinda proves his point there! lol If you're jealous that he has a new girlfriend, he is right. Don't break them up, if he wants to be with you, he will make it happen. If he doesn't make it happen and you end up breaking him and his girlfriend up, he will only dislike you more. That will not make him like you. sorry, move on to someone who can handle your jealousy!! (which isn't many, so good luck!)|`|mgdkr6hvaa	this is what you do, let them break up on their own, then be there for him after his breakup, but not too there or he'll think you were jealous of his girlfriend and are just happy she's gone, which it kinda sounds like that from what your saying, and well if  your saying you wanna break them up, then that sounds like you still are jealous, but whatever, i'm not here to judge,  <br>  But don't try to break them up, it will problably make him sad if he likes her, and if he finds out it was your fault, you'll have no chance with him.<br>  Try just being good friends with him again.|`|4IHe4rPYaa	uh let him go. stalker.
4wXPHANBaa	Friends will always understand. Main thing here is what you want? Do you want to go wiht your crush or with this best friend. Talk to your friend and tell her the problem you are facing. She is doign this to make you happy, so she will understand and may be help you to make a decision.|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	Say yes to your crush and tell the one you got set up with that you appreciate the effort from your friend but you don't think it will work, and that you want to be just friends. Communication is the key.<br>  <br>          Good luck and hoped this helped!!!!
JSakTuOHaa	Well honestly you never truely do. there will always be that feeling but the pain dies. It may be slow death but eventually you'll think back to good memories of the two of you. <br>  I know how hard it is but i promise it gets easier. I know you've been told that probably a million times but its true..Just give it time!! I hope you get to feeling better.
FxIZUUY5aa	say hey<br>  ask how her days been<br>  what class does she have next<br>  which class did she just come from<br>  what are some interests of hers<br>  ask her if she wants to hang out over the weekend or something|`|u8HYfTnyaa	Dear SAD and CRUSED,<br>  You know that 7 months is a long time, you should wait after school one day and tell her that you have noticed and you feel the same way. it won;t be awkward at all infact, you'll just end up exchanging numbers and make her happy. but YOU have to make the move! then the rest will follow.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	If she loved you for years1538 can't wait. Today, Is mus th truth.  She  will   want a house with doors and always be close . So you  must make no jokes.|`|F0NfKljZaa	Just be who you really are that is the best that you can do.|`|ekfdyQxyaa	Just ask her what she's doing tonight? ask her out., then you guys can talk to each other.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Only you can tell if you love him or not. Just because you still want to be with him, doesn't mean that you're in love. It just means that you two had a connection. Maybe there was no closure at the end and that's what you're feeling right now. If you need to, call him up and tell him that you need to talk to him. Ask him the questions you need answered and see how you feel after. If he doesn't want a gf right now and you still want to be with him, then the only thing you can do is tell him that and that you'll be waiting for him.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Cutie I think your trying too hard.You just want a boyfiend. So don't get emotionally involved with guys.Relax and enjoy your youth.Your only young once.Have fun.He's not the only pebble on the beach.Guys are a dime a dozen.|`|L8ZoEQwSaa	Cutie, there are alot of awnsers to your questions but you jus have to go with your own flow. No one can define love for you. You jus have to accept that he doesnt' want a gf right now. You can still be friends and that can always get you somewhere. Maybe you jus need to anwser some of your questoin you have in your heart.|`|gH67ebMJaa	no, he should be older than you.
AA10874773	you'll know when your a little older|`|A57LMS5Qaa	yuck...lol. you'll know sooner or later....|`|91AI21yKaa	Blow jobs.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	This is all very rude stuff, trust me you don't want to know.
jMtXbezWaa	You can't help it, you are attracted to who you are attracted to and you can't make yourself like someone or not like someone. I, as I'm sure other white guys, have no problem dating a mixed girl...but I'm not going to date someone just cause they're mixed. It all depends on the girl.|`|TeFn37bfaa	it shouldn't matter what color they are, some guy will like you for who u are and not your color and you should do the same.
m6G2RRufaa	Well then its not God's Plan for ur life.... maybe he has a different plan for ur life.... God already knows ur future....dont try to go against his will.... Maybe u should try going to church lol  Oh and the bible also talks about being unequally yolked. NO MISSIONARY DATING! Just look it up in the BIBLE|`|ef1a3bb6ccdff9603ef2bf36bc8b9c16aa	well thats quite a situation... muslims are really strong in their faith in general soo talk to ur parents and especially her parents get their Complete approval and then discuss the plans... but make sure to form a good bond with her parents it could make or break the chance of u being with her...first make sure she loves u then talk to her family and if u two really love each other both ur parents will get over the religious differneces and have a life together! :)|`|1f1723cd661bdbdaf61c1b462a066d8daa	I'm kinda in the same situation, but I'm the girl.  Hah.  It's tough.|`|n01WYIl3aa	You could always just BOTH keep your thoughts && beliefs of your faith && go to the court house && get married by the Justice Of Peace && then everyone wins !!!|`|xHpWus5faa	jftmojexrmtkxdrmftkxrmft xdrftmkxdkotkxdoritgmdxrk t mxderktmxkodrkoko|`|iJVk625naa	i don t think her parents will agree.
viBopoGTaa	it could mean u like him. or there could b just some strong connection between u guys. doesnt hav to b luv.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	It means you are attracted to him.  They're called butterflies..you get them when you're nervous or excited.|`|658db430da6f9cc5ef79b212ae46b5a8aa	Try thinking about what it would be like dating him. <br>  I had almost the same thing in my school when we would be doing a project and i would have to support her or help her hold something. You never know how a couple meets. your prolly just getting butterflies because ether A. You like him B. (in the nicest way possible) your just not used to a boy touching your hands?<br>  Try to get closer it might be a strong connection|`|OsmHJkFgaa	it means you have feelings for him.. possibly love...
A7nIADxgaa	"A" guy said he didn't want to go further, I don't see the point of still liking him so get over it (but still be friends of course)<br>  <br>  So, I guess there's only "B" left. Get closer to him, it takes time. Maybe then you could push your luck. If it doesn't work out, who cares? You'll find someone else :)
zKjgWdqAaa	Happens to me all the time.  I tend to squirt when I have a big orgasm, so when I have sexy dreams, I sometimes wake up in a puddle.  It's a pain sometimes, but I wouldn't trade.  Any orgasm's a good orgasm, right?|`|15f7ff19d071ecb358aa9fd0ab080c17aa	Definitely.  When I've been sexually active, I often have "spontaneous orgasms," just walking down the street or sitting doing nothing.  It's fun, if sometimes disconcerting.  It happens all the time in my sleep, but only wakes me up when it's one of those 10 on the Richter scale orgasms.|`|jbGsNRh8aa	Well, not exactly.  Sometimes (well, a lot) I have very horny dreams that wake me up so turned on that I have to masturbate immediately or I feel like I'll explode.  It would be nice if I could just come in my sleep so I don't have to wake up.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Oh yes.  I had that happen when I was 15, sleeping on my mom's couch.  It shocked me, but it felt good, I have to admit.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Yes, and it's frustrating sometimes.  Especially when the alarm clock wakes me up, and I don't have enough time to properly end it.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...happens to men...and happens to women too assuredly.<br>  Certainly having a very vivid imaginative sexual dream can spark all sorts of physical reactions in just about anybody sweetie.....even you!<br>  Enjoy your dreams at night babe...get plastic sheets if it becomes too commen though!<br>  ...LOL!!!...enjoy!
BKr3y30maa	Yes, I believe all women do that. And if a woman denies it, she's lying.  I do that all the time, especially when it comes to comparing my breasts and hair.  Good question.|`|06O8FaOjaa	HELL YEA I DUE IM ALWAYS TALKIN SHYT TO MY BESTFRIEND ABOUT CUS SHE HAS DOUBLE D BOOBS BUT ITS PERFECTLY FINE CUS MY BABYDADDY LOVES THEM|`|RmVSz5j2aa	I do at times. It depends on my mood|`|p2HIPtsSaa	yes|`|37M3dkkRaa	yeah even though it does sound weird now that you pointed it out...but i don't think we just compare boobs, i think we compare everything...hair, makeup, clothes, and bodies...even boyfriends lmao.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	It means she is nosey.|`|0F8hauikaa	She wants to know if you're seeing someone new. She might just be curious but more than likely wants you back. The first break up rarely takes because once one has some time to reflect, they start missing the good times they had together and also may realize that there's nothing better out there.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Hmmmm....<br>  She could be either:<br>  <br>  Trying to find out if youve moved on <br>  <br>  Trying to find out if youre available<br>  <br>  Seeing how youre doing as she is caring/nosey<br>  <br>  Maybe she heard a rumour and was trying to find out goss???<br>  <br>  Or she could ust simply want you back...Wait to see if she starts texting you more. If shes constantly texting you and shesaid shes single she'll more than likely be doing it to find out if youre available for her :)|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	It could be.<br>  <br>  Could be she is having a hard time getting a new love life started and she was missing the "good times" with you.<br>  <br>  If you want her back in your life, a better answer would have been "its hard to replace the fun I'm used to having with you".<br>  <br>  There was a ? on Yahoo Answers 2 days ago, where someone said she knew of a couple where the girl and her ex continued to get together just for sex after they broke up.  She was wondering if this was weird.  Some peole writing Answers thought it was.  But its kinda like admitting - even thought I don't think you are right for me, I still enjoy our sessions together - and until someone comes along who can match that - do you have any free time?|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	It could. Or it could just be a segue into her telling you about he awesome new boyfriend to rub it in your face.... but then I'm a pessimist. her being interested in your love life is usually a sign she's interested in being a part of you love life...|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	Yep she wants to ride you like a train boy|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Well it depends whether she frequently texts you, and adds 4 kisses on the end. If she does then she could just be being friendly. But if it's unusual for her to text you, and put kisses on the end then it's likely she's trying to say something.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just clear it up with her and ask her whether she wants to get back together? Then it's up to you to tell her how you feel about that.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Not necessarily...it just means that she is curious as to whether you are dating someone at the moment.  Seems like she is looking for the green light as to whether she can pursue you or not or it could mean that she is just nosy!!!|`|Yj3W7Gipaa	Sounds like she's hoping you still could be friends but with benefits.  Play it cool.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://diecasttoycarstrucks.com/index.php?cPath=1" rel="nofollow">http://diecasttoycarstrucks.com/index.ph...</a><br>  diecast toy trucks|`|2AAhiwgnaa	She might not really want to get back together necessarily, but she wants to know because she is curious.|`|fYAjV0GGaa	No, it doesn't. Don't get too excited. Sometimes girls do just mean what they say. She's trying to figure out if you're ok, moving on, etc.|`|fox5a3ePaa	It certainly sounds like it|`|YANN4mXNaa	Don't ask us. Get in there - even if it's for fun only.|`|DBuXLzjLaa	no it doesnt mean that,she might want a ride though|`|qV2atz6waa	I have been doing intense studies on breakup because I just got out on a 2 year. <br>  <br>  okay dude, she is still interested, if she wasn't, she would not care at all about what you are doing and she would be with people.<br>  <br>  If you want to get her back you can't go running right to her.<br>  <br>  You got to let her miss you a lot and realize that she really wants you. If you don't let it seem like you don't care she will start getting panicky.<br>  <br>  If she wants to hang out make sure it's not on that day or the next day. Wait a little while like a week, because she will be thinking about you all week.<br>  <br>  Don't ask her about who she is seeing or about her life. yes it is hard to not do that but if you seem not interested she will be all over you.<br>  <br>  People want what they can't have.<br>  <br>  If you make it too easy she will probably break up with you later.<br>  <br>  Play it cool and pretend like you got stuff going on. Don't spend long periods on the phone with her, make them brief, kind of like you have something to do, you know?<br>  <br>  I swear this works.|`|ghbaAWOCaa	It implies something. Either that or she wants to see how to make her way around making you want her...even if she doesnt want you.<br>  I know..strange but meh..O_o..girls|`|6a7UKZVAaa	she loooooovess you  . <br>  stay away and be kind unless you want er back.

BYQ2kHPjaa	It doesn't really matter if your alone or not. When I'm saying goodbye to my boyfriend, I just quickly peck him on the lips while my friends are around.Or if he walks you back to your house or something kiss him then. Other than that, just organise something to do with him at the weekend and kiss him! Good luck xx|`|7THgBSvfaa	You should have a movie night at your house one day.. That way you are not at the movies and you are not in public..|`|JCdBSULraa	Well, it's gonna be difficult to jump straight to kissing.  You're going to have to start out with light signs of affection.  So when you run into him, or when you first meet him for a date, give him a brief hug, and when he's dropping you off, or you're otherwise leaving to end the night, give him a hug if he doesn't try to kiss you.  Keep it up and he'll find the courage and correct timing to kiss you.  (Or did you really want to be the one initiating the kiss?)|`|3yWAyps4aa	if i was you i would probably kiss him on the mouth
tyl9aSu9aa	I had a miscarriage of a baby I wasn't sure I really wanted (I managed to get pregnant while on birth control and we used condoms every time), and after, my boyfriend at the time and I broke up. <br>  <br>  He decided to move across the state to be closer to his family, and since we were doing the "still be friends" thing, I offered to help him move. <br>  <br>  I drove a truck full of his stuff down to his new place (five hours away). I was planning on sleeping on his couch, helping him do some unpacking, then coming home the next day.<br>  <br>  Imagine my surprise when I walked into his new apartment with a load of boxes (despite doctor's orders that I take it easy) and find candles lit, a bottle of champagne chilling, and red roses on the table.<br>  <br>  He got on his knee and showed me a ring - a really ugly ring. My ex boyfriend, who I'd broken up with.<br>  <br>  I was so overwrought, I threw up on his shoes.<br>  <br>  Moral of the story: don't propose to a girl who dumped you. Duh.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	To get the full effect I have to go back to sometime: I was in kindergarten and I had missed the bus for our Field trip to the local orchard so the school call home adn my dad came and got me. I was so up set that I wasn't going to get a pumpkin for Halloween....my dad took me to the orchard and we had a picnic lunch in the orchard and we got a pumpkin for me and one for each of my siblings and went home...it was to this day the best day I have ever had with my dad.<br>  It was early Oct 2006 and we (my now husband) were going to our local orchard/pumpkin patch to get pumpkins for Halloween and some fruit, it was a bit cool and sprinkling off and on. When we got there the rain had stopped the sun was shinning and there was a rainbow, it was beautiful. We were walking through the orchard to pick some apples and there was a picnic bench all set up for a picnic as we approached the table Geno got down on one knee and asked me to marry him, Of course I said yes! We got married the following Oct and used pumpkins from the patch as our center pieces.|`|qAqowtECaa	It was a beautifully stormy summers evening on new years eve. We are simple outdoors type of people. He walked me down to the beach at my family's holiday house (a VERY special place for me), thanked me for loving him so unconditionally, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. All this after a day a being spoilt by having all my meals and drinks brought to me, even a cup of tea after I woke up grumpy from my afternoon nap.<br>  It was simple, beautiful, real and utterly unforgettable. He made it completely our moment and managed to include my entire family too.<br>  I hope that every girl feels so sure about their future husband...;)|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Mine was very simple, but we are very simple people, so I would have known what was going on if he took me somewhere out of the ordinary. He proposed to me at our house one night after a long evening together. Yes, he got down on one knee and of course I said yes!
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	Try not to ask questions that can be answered with one word.  When you say "hello", she says "hello"; then you say "how are you?", she says "good";  then you say "what are you doing now?", she says "nothing".  It's going nowhere.<br>  <br>  Ask "why" questions.  She can't answer with only one word ... "because" ... then you reply "huh?"  She has to give you an answer.<br>  <br>  If she is that shy and has a hard time to respond, you lead her to the things you want to know with Yes/No questions.  Try this:  "Do you always pull your shirt up and down?" ... no ... "Do you do that only in front of me?" ... yes ... (this is a very good sign if she only does that in front of you, then you can go ahead and confirm) ... "Do you have a crush on someone in the school?"  ... yes ... "Is he a student or a teacher?" ... student ... "Is he in your gym class?" ... no ... "Is he wearing glasses?" ... no ... "Is he a good student?" ... yes ... "do you always stare at him?" ... yes ... "Is that me?" ... yes ... "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" ... yes ... "I wanted to say this for a very long time, ... ... ... I really really really like you."<br>  <br>  I am very curious to see how it goes.  Good luck.|`|dSrJwJDoaa	yea she likes you shes just scared shell say something stupid and then she think you wouldn't talk to her anymore because she said something stupid.|`|cKDBwNITaa	Aww that sounds cute. I think she likes you but i have also had friends that have one word answers sometimes when i text them and IM them also but she may be busy or something. Also shy is alot to do with it. Just ask her if everything is okay because she seems sad because she is only giving one word answers. Your being sweet and caring and also knowing whys he is only giving one word answers. good luck : )|`|d4ZtRg0Daa	Ok calm down! She probably likes you but she is scared to tell you because she is shy. Maybe you should find out a little more about her like her favorite music through somebody else and then talk about it on AIM. You can also keep talking to her and talking until she actually starts talking back! Maybe she doesn't like typing...  I dont really know but I wish you luck and hope everything works out!
bxlF3MEiaa	omg....|`|sCr2iTczaa	with a razor.... make it so it looks like a landing strip... shave it off on the sides. Im not surprised, most guys don't like wolf p*ssy. Or you can get it waxed.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	wow.. you need to shave more than your bakini line.<br>  it has to be the whole thing silly.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	Use a new razor and use lots of soap, also doing it in a shower may be easier.|`|258mrT2Paa	i could send you my instructional dvd.|`|Kvajun9yaa	WOW! um why don't you go get it waxed!|`|AA10605419	Wow, he's picky and forward!! But at least he knows what he wants. Just get some shaving cream and a regular razor. Go slowly around your vagina but be careful not to nick yourself because when you pee it burns. Also, you are going to have to keep this up because it itches like HELL when the hair begins to grow back.|`|yUIekpb6aa	get an intuition shaver for sensitive skin, and shave as much as u want off! its guaranteed that u wont cut urself. he will be pleasantly surprised, whether u shave it all the way or just touch it up!! good luck!|`|AA10612626	Wax it or Nair
Em5PSrUgaa	WOW! Okay girlfriend, so obviously you really dig this dude, and you're saying that even though you've tried dating other guys that it always comes back to this guy. You know that he knows that you're attracted to him, (everyone probably does), and so at this point there is no mystery. I suggest rationally and calmly talking to him face to face about how you feel. Explain that you've been into him for awhile now and you'd just like to know if there is any chance that you two could be more. I wouldn't suggest crying or yelling in this situation, just talking. And don't send a note, text, friend ...whatever...to ask him for you. <br>  You have to REALLY HEAR  whatever he tells you, which I'm going to be honest, it doesn't sound like he's that into you. If he says as much to your face then the best thing that you could do is "take it like a woman", and get over him once and for all. Game over. Move on. BUT if he wants to at least give you two a chance then YAY for you! <br>  Again, do yourself a favor and ask him point blank once and for all, then you'll know for certain if he's worth anymore of your precious time...  or not. Good luck!|`|edIUAbCxaa	so i assume you're in either middle school or high school?? trust me, you dont love him. if you just started talking to him, you dont love him. its called lust...ive been with my gf for about a year and i still dont love her. btw, boys are not confusing...i think its girls that are confusing.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	He's not interested in you. You can try to be friends. But nothing else is going to happen. The reason why he didn't really talk with you after you showed him you liked him more than a friend was because he felt awkward around you because he didn't have the same feelings. Now that time has passed he probably feels a little more at ease, but he still does not show any signs of interest. Even though it's hard you have to move on.|`|S6dM85fxaa	Because we are simple.  Girls are so darn focused on a bazillion things at once.  We could care less what Mary's shoes looked like, or how suzie's hair brushed against bobby's cheek in line.  Your overworked brain cannot comprehend how we can be so happy with so little cranial activity going on.
lGBbWsuSaa	Im guessing its the same reasons a girl would do it. They lie about the little things because they think it doesnt matter. But a lie is a lie lol. I wouldnt sweat it if it was something not important though. Not all guys lie..just like all girls dont either ; ]|`|idKfxUTkaa	Not all guy lie, and if you catch him. Well then bring him aside and tell him you know, and that you take lies as a turnoff to you. That way he knows and may change, or leave. It's up to you.|`|mDkrW9Odaa	lol. its not only guys who do it. its just people dont want others to think that they do things wrong. face it you dont want to own up to something if u do it wrong or he just doesint want to upset you.  well that's what he does.  i dont lie coz i know the world is much easier without it . but thats why people do it|`|258mrT2Paa	you catch him lying all the time, so just what have you done about it ?|`|2QS8j9aOaa	because they never get called on it.|`|sjZ8eOjtaa	Because they're jerks|`|sLmPf3i4aa	cause the lies walking in their bloods and they born with it<br>  but not all guys are the same you should know how to chose them right<br>  they look like angles but inside they are Big DEVIL <br>  but don't try to forgive him fast and let him know that he is wrong and try to treat him the same way he treat you and tell him|`|LETd2hQwaa	Guys lie. Its what they do. Yes, about stupid little things that wouldn't even matter if they told the truth. I don't know what to tell you about this one. I just call them out on lies and make them give me answers until I'm satisfied then I remember what they said then and bring it back up later to see if their answers match. Something I learned from watching Madea.|`|V0rr15amaa	I don't mean to be rude<br>  but..<br>  <br>  if all the men in your life a liars then maybe it's you.<br>  you are picking (or attracting) the wrong type of guys.<br>  <br>  I don't lie<br>  and I am raising my sons to always be honest.|`|aNJhRxvHaa	He's lying because he keeps getting away with it.  Yes, you may find out about it, but you forgive him and move on.  If he doesn't have to deal with any consequences for lying, he's going to keep doing it.

Lots of times guys will run around in circles and waste time on pointless things. Then 5 years later, they still haven’t improved as much as they should have.<br>  <br>  In this article I clear the dust off this issue and give you a clear, concise method for getting good with women as quickly as possible without wasting time doing pointless things.<br>  <br>  Warning: The steps below take work. It is not easy. This journey will probably be one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. It’s also one of the most rewarding things. Having an abundance of beautiful women in your life is pretty awesome. It can take a LONG time, and lots of hard work, but you know what? It’s worth it!<br>  <br>  If you want to get SCARY good with women, as quickly as possible, there are 3 main things that you have to focus on: Attitude/Mindset, Lifestyle, and Approaches<br>  <br>  Attitude/Mindset<br>  No matter how far along you are in terms of your success with women (or in any endeavor in life), you should always keep your “student mindset”. Just because I’ve been actively working on myself for 2 years doesn’t mean anything. I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m still a student of the game and still learning every day. ALWAYS BE LEARNING. Try out new stuff. If you feel that you are “above” something or someone then you’re on the wrong track. You can be more experienced, but you’re still a student, and you’re always learning and getting better. This attitude is deadly and will help you improve much faster than the chumps who feel like they “already made it”. Stay hungry, you’ll see the difference.<br>  <br>  Approaches<br>  You’ve got to approach women that you don’t know and talk to them. Start with “Hey I’m Sean (insert your name)” and smile. Soon you’ll learn how to hold conversations, then how to get physical, then how to tease, then how to go on dates, then how to get laid. Eventually you will be getting laid very very consistently. It’ll freak you out how easy this process is once you get it.<br>  <br>  What you should do: Go out 3 or more times a week and meet women. Some guys can handle going out 7 times, some can’t. Figure out what works for you. You’re best bet would be going to night clubs and bars because there you’ll find lots of women to practice on. If you blow it with one girl, you can turn around and talk to another one right away. If you’re not old enough to go to clubs and bars or if you just can’t do it, you have to find somewhere else with a lot of women. You can try malls or bookstores. Go out 4x a week and approach 10 girls each time. Make a custom plan to fit your schedule. The more women you talk to the faster you’ll improve, which brings me to my next point…<br>  <br>  Lifestyle<br>  Women should be part of your life. Get more girls who are friends. You’ll approach girls, get their numbers. If it doesn’t work out, keep in touch with them anyway. After a couple months you should have way more girls in your phone than guys.<br>  <br>  Note: At one point I had to make an excel spread sheet because I forgot which girl was which. This is common, you’ll get it too.<br>  <br>  If you have a sister, hang out with her. Surround yourself with as many women as possible. Old, young, fat, slim, funny lookin’, hot, etc… The point is to get you comfortable with the feminine energy. Women will begin to feel more safe and relaxed around you simply from the vibe that you project.<br>  <br>  If you: are always learning, doing your approaches consistently, and hanging out with lots of girls everyday, your results with women (and self confidence in general) will skyrocket. In a month, you’ll see a major improvement, in a year you won’t even recognize yourself.<br>  <br>  Take the plunge, you’ll be glad you did.
jBxW6ee9aa	Well I am used to that kind of thing because my dad is like that!! So I wouldn't have reacted in such a way. I would have just laughed it off and I would have told you a story of how my dad does things like that! =3  But you should just give her some time to think. She will come around. Hope this helps. I hope it works out for you guys.|`|QxQxVPnraa	Well if i was her i would have not freaked like that i would just have laughed and gotten you back somehow...<br>  <br>  but if you really like her you should just apologize and say your were acting immature and you will never do it again and alll the stufff|`|n6sMy0Ndaa	you're disgusting. I'd break up with you if i was her. That's just like telling her you don't care and you'll do whatever you like to her. farting in her face? that's disgusting it really is. grow up!|`|ZG6tDWOPaa	yeah she is over reacting just a little too much <br>  i would stop trying to contact her sooner or later she will wonder why u stopped and she will call u<br>  i would have just ignored it|`|uBssj3Znaa	you are ridiculous. don't be surprised if she breaks up with you. I know that is what I would have done.
69AGSFcZaa	Im a little baffled as to why you did ignore her. Why did you ignore her anyway? If she (and you) were single, then why not go for it?|`|RaVvl5OJaa	It's not a challenge anymore or maybe you really hurt the poor girls feelings...|`|JNcB7Ffbaa	She tries to get you back for it I do it all the time.
VrydDAJiaa	the best thing to do, is not ask for him back. the best feeling in the world is when u get over someone and then threy want you back and you say no.as for seeing him with another girl just think shes stuck with a guy who will probably make her feel as bad as you do now so good luck to her. i think the hardest thing is seeing your ex with another girl but youll deal with it and be fine, just show him you dont care even if you do! plus he didnt actually say hes seeing anyone else so maybe your overthinking ( i know its best to think the worst so u can be prepared tho) <br>  dont get back with this guy he hurt you and u dont wanna go thru the same thing aggain!  i hope you feel better soon, chin up and see your friends :D|`|SRZza0cWaa	awww.. i wish i knew the answer t that one.. am still in love with my EX..:'(|`|iwE1QRKdaa	Just find a new bf<br>  answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjn_Cz.YevtvDTIKdSCg_8gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223131151AAdGweq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

PLAY IT COOL! just like who said? oh yeah your best and most beautiful friend in the world! listen to jenny, listen to jenny, don`t be mad at jenny for being friends with tina!<br>  love u pick mine as best answer!|`|P240bUFxaa	The best thing to do is play it cool.  I know it gets hard when you really like someone and to act like you dont even notice them, but thats exactly what you need to do in this situation.  Act like its no big deal that hes so distant.  If hes smart he'll come back to you.  Guys always like to chase for some reason.  I hope I helped.
5JArHQ2Laa	You need to be honest with your friend.  Try to be nice about it, wait a while if you need to cool down.  Always speak with careful words, remember words and actions cannot be taken back very easily.  You want to try to be as mature about this as possible, even if she isnt. It always feels good to be the one to do the right thing, even if you don't think so at the time.|`|oFeNwMheaa	break it down to her gentle, go slow or just ignore her for a while and let her figure out why yur talking to her or spread rumors about what she did then you dont have to tell her and yet she still knows!|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Get someone else who she doesn't know to write your complaint about her down on a piece of paper (so she can't recognize the hand writing), then slip it into her bag or pocket.
WA65IQ0kaa	Hey<br>  <br>  In a girl i look for i good personality like bubbly n funny shes obviously got to be pretty and completely comfortable with herself in every not because of sex reasons but because i don't like to be around a girl who feels awkward around me if that makes sense she has to be confident to a certain point jus so that she doesn't mind kissing me in front of her m8s or my m8s but to be honest personality is the kay the other thing i like in a girl is for her to be blunt with me so if she has a problem with the way i do or say something i want her to tell me so that i can sort it out.<br>  <br>  the only thing is... that's jus me other dudes looks for other things
QwCsFKLQaa	the only way to help him is to re microwave him, its the only way to reverse the effects . <br>  <br>  <br>    then take him to get his national id card and micro chip or bar code tattoo. <br>  <br>    once you re microwave you should easily be able to brainwash him into believing in god the government or any other complete bucket of nonsense. .|`|PxcEAoBMaa	I think he may be on drugs.

Jlnlh17Oaa	Yes, ithink everyone on earth is beautiful in his or her own way. God made some people ugly on the outside, but with a lovely personality on the inside and others physically beautiful, but with a very mean personality. beauty is all around us!|`|TDfU9Zndaa	Beauty isn't all about the physical. There are things in life or in the environment that are ugly but no person in this world is U.G.L.Y God created every person they way he wanted them to look. Some maybe a little different looking on the outside  everyone is different no one is the same not even twins, triples, or multiples are different in their own way they may look alike or have similiar features. But at the end of the day your personality is what really makes you beautiful. People can be less appealing to your eye but not ugly. I believe the word ugly should be taken out of the dicitionary and everyone's vocabulary if used in the wrong context.|`|6Nq3HKjYaa	i agree with you, everyone in this world is beautiful in one way or another, everyones different, and beautiful in different ways, thats what makes us so special|`|NHoG9OBjaa	Absolutely, every one has their own redeeming qualities. Looks are not everything, sometimes personality can be the most attractive part of an individual.|`|djUMvICoaa	Once you get past the superficial stuff, everybody has the potential to be beautiful.  It's the bad habits that can cloud over the inner beauty of others.|`|N5q1osbCaa	Everyone is beautiful in their own way, no question about it.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	No, there are ALOT of people that have ugly personalities!|`|n7BIleRFaa	Yes in your own way...|`|PYQsv6eMaa	fu|`|FLPRFTccaa	what about you?|`|SRZza0cWaa	off course..x|`|pMDY89KQaa	yes everyone should try to be beautiful on the inside.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Yes. The ugly is only that persons personal opinion.|`|M63kq3AYaa	Osama Bin Laden, Ehud Olmert, Michael Jackson, Myra Hindley, need I go on?|`|FJswVeqbaa	everyone iis beautiful in thei own ways|`|7ko9czaaaa	its whats inside that counts,|`|FHjLB6v2aa	Absolutely.  I like to believe that the reason that maybe they weren't made outwardly beautiful is because they've got more beautiful inside themselves waiting for someone special to discover it.  Sometimes I'm even a tiny bit (the littlest bit) jealous.  Why? Because they know when someone really likes them for who they are... not just because of their looks.  I'm not trying to brag (because beauty is nothing to brag about), but you can say I'm pretty, and because of it, I can't always tell when a guy likes me because of who I am, or just because I'm another pretty face to have fun with.  So, as I was saying, yes... I absolutely do believe that every person is beautiful, even if they're not so attractive on the outside.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Not everyone can be beautiful but everyone can be kind. And when you get to know a nice person, you stop seeing the face and it's like you're talking to their very soul, whether they are attractive or not.<br>  Luckily, though, I'm the sex.|`|7xnMr6zVaa	i don't think any body is ugly because beauty something u have in your self u can be skinny,fat,short,tall,asia,mexican,and american the inner beauty matter more then outside beauty|`|uQZQTAAlaa	Yes everybody is beautiful in their own way.|`|eth48m7Iaa	there are no ugly people just differnet tastes. I also believe beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Hate to say this but no. If everyone in the world is beautiful doesn't the word "beautiful" lose its meaning|`|mpFuO5Ilaa	i dont either, i think everyone is unique. but i see people with a mean heart...ugly.|`|8EnlSE93aa	beauty is over-rated
xrULvzbOaa	Oh gosh. that is so lame. I'm sorry. It sounds like she really is not a good friend.  :( She should apologize, she shouldn't have even freaked you out like that. Even if she was kidding, its still stupid. You do NOT tell a guy that. lol I'm not just saying 'she is wrong' to make you feel better, but she is definitely wrong. Girls can be so stupid sometimes and if she is spreading rumors about you she really isn't a true friend. A true friend would feel bad for freaking you out, even if she was joking. If she was joking, she wouldn't have taken your peanuts. lol But, even if she was, she wouldn't be spreading rumors and things. she's only doing that because she knows you are right - and from what I've heard of her, she can't stand to be wrong.|`|0d5f73aab03f2fae4fe5060db324a6f7aa	this luks lyk she is bullying you, tell her off, n tell her nt to spread those rumuors. dont spread her rumours coz its nt worth it. if she dont then tel her she needs to get a lyf, somtyms guys dont even care abt guys periods|`|MTUHRMdZaa	To be honest girls kinda suck when it comes to friendship a lot! I mean I'm a girl too but they do. You have to be really careful with who you choose to be your close friends and better yet who you choose to tell your secrets to. I would just leave her alone for a little while. If she is going to be like that then you don't need her as a friend but if she comes and apologizes and actually means it then maybe forgive her but still be careful with what you tell her. Well I hope everything ends up good!|`|LS8LcuRaaa	You need to grow up. This is childish.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I had two daughters so I understand. Just one thought. She is not a safe person and you shouldn't share personal information with her again
XH2o1MM6aa	.You've behaved rather foolishly by you racial innuendo. All you can do now is wait till he cools down and accepts your apology.He will too.(forgive)|`|kGBli717aa	You better change your mind about having a Chinese name if you marry him. That alone is probably a deal breaker. He sounds proud of his heritage, show him you respect that and I think things will work out. Hell, send him flowers w/ a nice note; it couldn't hurt.
5N2lcQtjaa	It seems that he is pulled between two people he likes but he must pick one.  If Valerie is a popular girl then its understandable that if a guy dates a popular girl he gets attention from his peers.  But then he has a crush on you and really likes you but doesn't want to hurt you.  So he is drawn between popularity(valerie) and the crush of his life(you)|`|FiTaCjuXaa	He wants YOU to say those "words"|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	cookie has a great answer BTW ;)<br>  <br>  i totaly agree with the person above (cookie)<br>  <br>  he seems to be a a little confused also. I dont think he knows that you like him so maybe valerie is giving him a little bit more sign. <br>  <br>  I ve had this happen to me before ....it hurts i no but i jus had to keep quiet becasue if you confess to him he might reject you and that gets even worse <br>  <br>  or worse he can tell someone then it gets spread. If mark asks valerie out and they date....then valerie hears about you and mark..then you will be hurt, humiliated and sad.
JASJ6sxtaa	maybe you should give him space and see if he'll call you..maybe your smothering him and he's takin it for granted. if you leave him alone for a few days or dont be around him so long either he'll realize he does miss you or he'll realize thisis what he wanted..<br>  <br>  how does that saying go "If you love something let it go, if it comes back its yours if it dont it was never yours to begin with" <br>  <br>  ok so i jacked up the cute quote but you catch my drift..|`|t2syQ78Paa	it doesn't necessarily mean he's cheating,,maybe he's just regretting movin in (so far from his hometown). <br>  give him the space,,,if he stays,great,,if not,there's other fish in the sea. <br>  good-luck|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Cheating. I'd dump just for saying those things anyway. Who wants to be with someone so cold?
xGshAiXOaa	Yes, why wouldn't they have?  There's nothing left to wait for.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Absolutely yes, unless I suspected one of them of being gay and marrying as a cover up.  I would actually assume that they had had sex before marriage also to be honest.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Yes.<br>  If they haven't, there's a BIG problem.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	Yes|`|BMEMH7JLaa	YES|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I would assume yes....especially in today's world.  hell, it is almost safe to assume anymore that a couple that has been only dating for a month has already had sex.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I would assume that have had sex no matter what age they are. I would assume that even if they weren 't married.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	One would think so...|`|mzH7wV6maa	Yes I would have, what did they do on their Wedding Night? xx|`|LS8LcuRaaa	yes|`|PY160XO7aa	hope so|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I would assume so if they were married more than 24 hours!|`|JaNE0HKyaa	I would think they would have.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	I would assume they were having sex way before they were married.|`|qULxHALhaa	I would say yes, but it depends on them i guess~<br>  Some people dont seem to be as bothered by it :S<br>  But just cos other couples may have doesnt mean they have to follow lol|`|0M5XYROfaa	Yeah id definatly assume they had had sex together!|`|srNze5uIaa	Yes.|`|tlxG2q04aa	Yes.|`|tEy9hvebaa	I would assume a couple who have been married for 24 hours to have had sex multiple times!|`|YKQomDJMaa	Absolutely.  I'd put money on it.|`|MtXK9Ecnaa	ofcourse why not?|`|Iod5edCSaa	I would assume a couple married for more then 12 hours have had sex.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	That would be safe to assume, yes.|`|V6ZahAzvaa	Most people would, unless you have ever seen Sex and the City Charolette married a man and they haven't had sex for over a month... eventually they got a divorce though
89UOqaVNaa	You don't need a girlfriend until you are ready to think about getting married.<br>  <br>  People are not toys, arm candy, or ego boosters.<br>  <br>  Think about what qualities you like in girls, what would make a good wife and a good mother for your children. Wait to have sex and enjoy it with your virgin wife.<br>  <br>  Don't be in a rush to destroy your body and soul in the vicious free-for-all they call the dating game.<br>  <br>  Set your eyes on the real thing, a lasting relationship of love, commitment, genuine friendship, mutual care and understanding, shared goals and values, and someone you can really enjoy as a wife for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Just take a peek at the "Marriage & Divorce" page and find out how devastating all the sleeping around is to relationships. People just can't keep it together because people are only looking to fulfil their selfish desires without real care about the other person.
Zb7H4B3Xaa	In the medical sense, she is still a virgin.  She has not had intercourse.  In the experience realm, she is pretty experienced.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, it is a lame excuse.|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	she does'nt know what shes talking about. unless she has  had a penis in her vagina regardless if the guy came off or not she is a virgin still, plain and simple.|`|RqTC18NFaa	Just like you can't be half pregnant.  She is delusional. She probably means she's done oral but not intercourse.|`|258mrT2Paa	she could be half right.|`|cFoBxLDVaa	She's a fudgin retard. She has went as far as oral sex. Oral sex is no where near having sex. Her vagina has never had a cock in it making her 100% virgin but her mouth has had a cock in it or someone had there mouth on her V.|`|7N5GrBSlaa	Ha ha ha! What is everything? Oral sex is sex!<br>  She might as well have sex, anything inserted in the vagina except a tampon is questionable. Fingers, toes, tongues, vibrators, etc.<br>  No such thing as half!|`|OXtYMoVLaa	You can’t be half a virgin. That girl’s just in denial. She thinks having oral sex isn’t sex just because there’s no penetration. Any sexual behavior is sex. That girl’s a ******* idiot.|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	You're right, you can't be half a virgin, either you are or you aren't.|`|iPmP6DAHaa	Actually she is a virgin.|`|aNJhRxvHaa	She's stupid.  If you haven't had sex, you're a virgin. That's all there is to it.|`|HlJjl3Beaa	i have also done everything except sex...and i still consider myself a full virgin!!! cuz no dick has gone through my pussy...|`|G0mtkuDvaa	she is slow|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I see what she is saying.  She still has not done the traditional sex act, but she has done everything else including what Monica Lewinsky did.  Bill Clinton did not define that as sex.  Of course it depends on what the definition of "is" is.|`|Qe9EULsdaa	Rachel McAdams said that in "Mean Girls" lol. No, you need to have regular legit sex to be considered not a virgin.
hoGpOrOUaa	They can appriciate the qualities older women have more than older men can.<br>  <br>  The fact that older women are more mature and successful and know what they want emotionally.<br>  Also the fact that they are more sexually experienced and don't play games.|`|Ilq7WEM5aa	How young? Um i don't think so..<br>  I'm almost 18 and to be honest, i find guys my age really immature and mostly unable to have a serious relationship.. I like older guys. They make you feel safer and know how to treat a girl better than what a guy under his 20's can. It's all got to do with how mature they are, its pretty true that girls mature quicker than guys do, that's why most of us prefer older men..<br>  Just my opinion|`|Khs7HBYmaa	NO. I THINK OLDER MEN HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE AND THEY ARE NOT AS IMMATURE.|`|2ij4wwjgaa	in my own personal experiences, younger men usually try harder than older men...<br>  they have shown me more respect than the older guys<br>  but they are most of the time a little less mature<br>  but overall, the difference between them is very slight when it comes to treating you right...it depends on the guy

But in the end you don't really say goodbye its more like see you later. Even if you don't talk right after you break up you will eventually talk again.

Think back to when you were younger, as a kid, and wanting something so desperate for Christmas etc, and how you couldn't put it down, or stop playing with it.<br>  But eventually, you tire of it, and the same can happen to a relationship. That doesn't' mean, it wasn't worth it, or you didn't have fun, while it lasted, but that first feeling you had, never lasts.<br>  Keeping a relationship going, for years, takes lots of work, and effort. You just can't go along, assuming, things and people will never change, they do. It's all part of life.

You can see by its size that it passes as 1 carat to the naked eye, and ideal 1 carat is 7mmx5mm, 1 mm is the width of a credit card, mine the length is shy of a 1ct by less than 1/3 the width of a credit card.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ajediam.com/Sizes-of-Diamonds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajediam.com/Sizes-of-Diamonds...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.diamond.com/education/education.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.diamond.com/education/educati...</a><br>  go under carat to give you more info<br>  <br>  Because its a step cut, the clarity should higher, and recommendations are minimum VS2, though I wouldn't do less than VS1<br>  <a href="http://www.loveanddiamonds.com/learn/emerald-cut-diamonds-engagement-ring.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loveanddiamonds.com/learn/eme...</a><br>  <br>  her hand is very small, how do the rounds look with the emerald?<br>  <br>  I I checked, <a href="http://www.bluenile.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluenile.com</a> based upon the D/SI1 and diamonds 1.00-1.02ct, emerald and the prices were 4,226-4,908 with an average of 4,567.00.<br>  <br>  Prices for the setting and the band alot depends on if they are gold or platinum but this should add at least 1000 dollars to it, so overall from a price point you did do a good job|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	quit bragging boy!  it sounds lovely and i hope she loves it as much as you want her too. good luck!  <br>  she said she'd be happy with a ring with no diamond in it - but you are doing what you want - hmmm sorry doesn't sound like a caring fiance - sounds more like a bit of a show-off and controlling kinda guy.|`|7jA1FiY8aa	That's a lotta diamonds!  I think you'll get the reaction you're hoping for, providing you bought something with her style in mind.  My engagement ring is one stone, pear shaped, .75 ct.

Congrats!|`|MkErhX7Haa	Well the most important factors in determining a diamond's value are color, cut, and clarity, not carat weight.  You got it for $5,000 because the main diamond is clarity SI1, which means it has slight inclusions that are visible to the naked eye.  You would typically not want to buy a diamond that has visible flaws, but what is done is done, and only you can know what she wants.  I have a friend with a 2 carat diamond.  It has a big ol black streak through it, but she doesn't care, because she got the 2 carat diamond she wanted. Personally I'd rather have a smaller diamond that's near perfect.  Tiffany's has diamonds that are 1 carat that sell for $40,000 because they are so near perfect.|`|KcXFs6Fzaa	I used to manage a jewellery store, so i must say the quality and size of that diamond is pretty awsome, and i must also say the emerald cut is not only my favorite style of a cut for a diamond, but most other ladies too...if there man can offord em!!! Good job, and good luck!!!|`|qxTKH4c2aa	Wowie!  That sounds beautiful!  I don't want to burst your bubble though, have you already had it sized for her?  I only ask because a friend of mine also has tiny fingers and her ring had diamonds on the band as well and the jeweler had a hard time sizing her ring, the diamonds on the sides kept popping out :(
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	1.  there is nothing you can do about your best friend's GF.  She's going to feel what she's going to feel and if she can't be bothered to socialize with you and your BF with your best friend then that's her and your best friend's problem to deal with.  You are out of it, that has nothing to do with you really.  The two of them have to decide how they will handle the issue and you and she will just have to accept your best friend's final decision on that subject.<br>  <br>  2.  Actually, I like how your BF is handling the situation on his end.  You know how he feels but he understands that it is his issue to deal with and he's making an effort to avoid telling you that you have to choose between him and your best friend.  He understands intellectually there is nothing going on and he has nothing to worry about but emotionally he feels what he feels and it's insecurity but he's not making his problem your problem.<br>  <br>  So don't press your BF to talk about this if he isn't ready.  Just pay attention to him and let him know that if he has any issues, it's alright for him to speak up and tell you about them.<br>  <br>  I have found the best way to deal with exes who are now friends when you are romantically involved with someone else is to do the following:<br>  1.  never have any communication with the ex that your current is not aware of.<br>  <br>  2.  introduce your ex to your current and arrange for everyone to socialize together on occasion.  The current partner getting to know the ex and becoming a friend is a great way to defuse insecurities.  they get to see that the old relationship is really over and has moved on to something else and that there is no threat to them.  <br>  <br>  Do note: an ex who is unwilling to do this has just told you that he/she has ulterior motives for being your friend.  In that case, that's a red flag that it may be time to rethink the friendship, as in--do you want to go back to the ex and try again or are you over the ex and want to move forward with your current partner.<br>  <br>  3.  don't spend so much time with the ex that it seems you are dating the ex instead of the current partner.<br>  <br>  4.  Listen with open ears, mind, and heart to what your current partner's fears are concerning your friendship with the ex.  They will tell you what it is that you need to do to reassure them that there is nothing still going on between you and the ex.<br>  <br>  5.  date only people who are cool with you having an ex as a friend otherwise you may find yourself in a position where you are forced to choose between your current and your ex.<br>  <br>  6.  Most important of all.  Make sure all the old feelings of love are done and over with both of you before you try to maintain a friendship with the ex.  If one of you still carries a torch for the other then you haven't reached a place where it is safe for the two of you to be just friends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	This is just too much to digest but at the same time there can be a resolution in the matter. What you might have to do (which I know you don't want to do) is discontinue being friends with you former ex. 9 times out of 10 you can't really be friends with you ex based upon the fact that the both of you have history together. That can be a good and a bad thing. Then your current boyfriend has a problem with your ex, which I can't blame him. It comes across as if your holding on to your ex for comfort of some sort. If you are supposedly happy with your current boyfriend then you don't need the ex in your life as a friend. It's a reason why he is your ex. Plus trying to be friends with your ex's current girlfriend is a bad idea. There's no need for you to get to know or try to be friends with her. That's a mess waiting to happen. I know this maybe a lot to handle but at the same time it maybe for your good. Hope this is some help.|`|wRRU7xlkaa	Well, Get Ur Mate 2 Talk 2 His Gf And Talk 2 Ur Bf, Starting With:<br>  <br>  'Please Don't Change The Subject'<br>  <br>  But If Ur Bf Don't Understand, Sorry, But Hes Not The Right Guy For You.|`|LBW8Rv35aa	Your significant others are both really insecure. They don't necessarily "hate" either of you, but are intimidated by your closeness. All you can do is make sure that you each spend quality time with your significant other so they know they aren't second best. If it seems like one of them is vying for attention while you are spending time with your friend, take a break and let the other one go with his or her s.o. for a while. However, you shouldn't let them stop you guys from being friends. If they get too insanely jealous, you can either tell them to cut it out or to get lost. Some people have way too many issues for you to magically work through them. Depending on what happened to them, they may even need to seek counseling.
fFnfFROQaa	Well, next time you tell a girl that you like her, make sure you follow up with asking her on a date within 1-2 days after wards.<br>  <br>  You let her sit for a week, she may think you aren't serious or playing a joke on her.<br>  <br>  so what do i do?<br>  YOU GO UP AND TALK WITH HER<br>  <br>  how do i start a conversation with her?<br>  SAY HELLO, ASK HER HOW HAS SHE BEEN SINCE YOU LAST SPOKE TO EACH OTHER....REAL EASY ONE<br>  <br>  anything that i can say to break the ice? <br>  SAY HELLO....SUPER EASY ONE<br>  <br>  how do i get her to look at me in the eye and actually talk for a while without her friend coming in and interrupting<br>  YOU LOOK AT HER AND TALK WITH HER.<br>  YOU DO NOT DISS HER FRIEND (you lose points if you diss other people's friends), YOU ADDRESS THEM BOTH BY SAYING HELLO, THEN ASK TO SPEAK IN PRIVATE IF NEED BE.|`|IpwsYe2kaa	Just talk to her. Just hey what's up usually starts an easy converstaion. And if you like her, then tell her yourself.  <br>  <br>  About her friend interrupting, you'll just have to deal with that in a public setting. And I wouldn't be mean to her friend cuz that could make a girl lose interest if ther are close enough friends. Once you tell her you like her you could just ask her to go out with you somewhere, or if you're not wanting her friend to tell the world dont make it sound like your asking her out make it sound like just a hangout invite. Then you can talk to her in private without her friend interrupting|`|xCnpDF3daa	Compliment her.<br>  Tell her how beautiful she is.<br>  Then ask her if she would like to go out to the movies or something and tell her how you feel. thats how my boy friend did it.
6RzEI4MRaa	Haha, I'm having the same problem. Just be careful, I've learned to keep my distance. And if you don't like what he's doing, tell him. And if he doesn't respect that then yeah, he's probably a pervert.<br>  The guy I'm having the problem with calls me extremely sexy, but I've heard he's already gotten in some girl's pants. Ask around, find out what he's like. Don't just give into him, you don't want him to think your easy. You've got the power, use it.|`|ulI8Tx4paa	kick him in the balls
2KC467tFaa	Tell you love him, and you need him to be patient with you because you've never had an example of a positive male figure in your life. Tell him that you still have issues with trusting men, but you're trying really hard to work through this problem. Ask him to try to understand where you're coming from. Tell him his support would help you tremendously. I've had different experiences, but I've never had a strong, positive male in my life until my husband. He knows everything I've had to face. It's sometimes frustrating for him because he doesn't know how to help more, but he's wonderful about it. I promised him to keep talking to him and tell him what I need. I'm still working through issues, but I have his support, and things are getting much better. Your boyfriend will probably respect you more because he'll have a better understanding of everything you've been through, and you still found the courage to open up and talk to him about it. I wish you the best.|`|EBXvl6Foaa	I so sorry for what you have had to go through! I can't imagine being in your position. <br>  <br>  My best advice to you would be to sit your boyfriend down and tell him what happened. Let him know why you didnt tell him before so that he doesn't feel lied to. Let him know how important he is to you and that you wanted to know before your baby comes. <br>  <br>  As far as when. I would say as soon as possible. Find a time when you guys can talk for a while and can be alone with no distractions. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out, and I hope the best for the both of you and your baby!|`|BK2ammwzaa	If you like to read there's a really good book called 'the courage to heal' by Ellen Bass.  You could look for it in your local library.  You may also like to get some tips on 'disclosure' which is telling someone about your abuse.  Perhaps write down some phrases or words that might help make it easier like 'what I find helps me is when you...' things like that.<br>  It may also help if you both go to see a family therapist or rape crisis counsellor so that they can help keep things on track and help you both get what you need.  Healing takes its own time.  I wish you well on your journey.<br>  For more try the site below.

rgOPYV7naa	why is your best friend 12? and phone sex doesn't count. and it would be really immature to ruin someone's life because you're jealous of a twelve year old.|`|ouUti34faa	First off, it's w-h-o-r-e, and second, if he hasn't touched her, then there is nothing you can do except dump him and wait for the arrest story in the paper for when he does or tell her parents, which is what I would probably do. If your boyfriend is 18 and is interested in a 12 year old, then he has problems. You might want to mention it to your brother, but at that age relationships don't really mean anything. By the way, why are you even friends with a 12 year old anyway? Isn't she kind of young for you to have anything in common with?|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	Tell your boyfriend how old she really is.  If he stops, then let it be.  If he doesn't, then alert the cops.  It isn't fair to him if he doesn't actually know how old she is, no matter how much of a db he might be otherwise.  Think about it, if he got caught right now, he would get in a huge amount of trouble because some evil 12 year old lied to him.  He would be punished for being lied to!  That's not fair at all!  One of the worst loopholes in modern law.|`|MDpXUrRKaa	No, don't send him to jail. It's wrong of him to cheat, but he did not know she was twelve. In all honesty, if he has sex with you, that's illegal since you're a minor.<br>   Tell him what is happening. Then tell your best friend. Then break up with your bf. If he hits on your 12 year old friend, you have to tell an adult.|`|kvlnADyIaa	First off It's "whore" not "HORE!!!"<br>  Second, no, you shouldn't. <br>  Third, Phone sex isn't cheating. <br>  Fourth, If you think it is, look at it this way. Would you rather have them having sex? Or Phone sex?<br>  <br>  Overall, No, don't. That'd be a stupid decision.|`|6RzEI4MRaa	Chill. It's fine. Don't call the cops, you'll just embarrass yourself.<br>  Your boyfriend sounds like a creep if he likes a 12 year old. Dump him, he just sounds like a pervert and you don't need a guy like that.|`|GoABmevnaa	you should not get involved with this at all. Just stop talking to both of them and let karma get them back. You could tell her mom is you really wanted to do something, but it could cause a huge mess. Just keep out of it.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	you need a new best friend. there's no real reason to call the cops because nothing illegal was done. you need to set your man straight. he shouldn't be having phone sex with anyone but you if he can't do that then let him go|`|zlPGlNOMaa	Yes yes YES!!! That might as well be illeagal and you should be mad at your friend. Tell your brother to break up with her and call the police and take your boyfriend to a counseler.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	I dont think phone sex with a minor is illegal unless there was some kind of solicitation during the process.|`|x3TR3nj0aa	uhmm thats illegal hunn. <br>  and how could she pass for 16 when she is 12? <br>  little weird... <br>  and break up with him if he's cheating on you.|`|cYTAwen1aa	seriously? just let your bf have some fun every once in a while. b/c obviously your cant get the job done like your friend.|`|AA10624754	Wow! Tell ur boy friend and ur brother what they are doing! Don't send his A** To jail!|`|9LlqTePBaa	u mean whore and did he have sex with her or phone sex wow that b.s|`|5c52aa995c60e7a74645dc2f495b5785aa	get over it and move on.  lil kids shet....|`|wRRU7xlkaa	Dont.. Then Ur Bratty Friend Will Get What She Wants...|`|Dd6y8YDfaa	I'd call a halt to your relationship and warn them both that they shouldn't take what they're doing any further as it could end up with him going to prison. I'd tell him how old she is so he knows and he can't claim that he didn't know her age and if it carries on tell her parents.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye out for this girl she's obviously not mature enough to know what she's getting into.|`|jMtXbezWaa	Well if you're talking about the whole he is 18 thing, you have no room to talk because you are underage too. But if you are so concerned about it, just tell her parents...even though I don't know if phone sex is really something he can go to jail for. Real sex maybe...|`|2fn2GYhnaa	Try reasoning before you completely ruin his life.|`|OZmn1n5qaa	I would, send his @$$ to jail<br>  <br>  BTW, rock on, it's nice to see women getting back into rock/metal/etc|`|gxw7vAJQaa	I'm pretty sure 16 is the legal age, at least depends where you are. Just to inform some of you.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, I'm not sure 'phone sex' counts up to much, the cops couldn't do much other than wait and see or just scare them and all family involved..<br>  <br>  One thing is obvious to me would be to A) Stop seeing this person and referring to him as a 'bf' if he cheats on you, especially with your best friend, and doubly especially with someone so young.<br>  but also, B) I would say it's fair to also tell him how old your 'friend' is and that you know whats going on.<br>  <br>  When you tell him he may be disgusted by her and end it there, or be mad or uncaring towards you (that's when the cops should def know... if it continues, and to a much more real extent.)<br>  <br>  Also if he is disturber by your friend, but beg or pleads to you to try and forgive him... well I can only say, neither of these people sound like anyone i would want in my life.<br>  <br>  Take this as a good thing. A learning experience. Show yourself some value and respect and love yourself enough to choose better.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	hes a pedophile , def. call the cops|`|7585zXZIaa	yeah|`|9PfEKygaaa	you're 16, dating an 18 year old, and best friends with a 12 year old?<br>  <br>  and to anyone saying he's a pedofile, you don't know that, he's been misled, probably never saw the girl, but either way, she told him she was 16... he'd go to jail for dating you just as quickly... besides, he never did anything with her but talk on the phone.|`|SS87lbOCaa	HOW OLD ARE YOU? IF YOUR BEST FRIEND IS 12 AND YOUR BOYFRIEND IS 18? S L U T MUCH?|`|lyDzjMfcaa	That's f8cked up.|`|f2AWSb48aa	stfu|`|AA10874773	first of all, he'll have charges on him from you & her.  that means both you & your bf will have to go to court, be examined, be questioned, etc.  and remember, this is something that will be on his record for the rest of his life.  he'll have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life, no matter what he does for work or where he lives.  so think long & hard about what your doing.|`|bQ6LNgGbaa	holy crap, that's messed up.<br>  but since it was just phone sex i don't think you could get him in that much trouble unless you can prove that they did stuff more than just over the phone. I personally just think that you should tell your friends parents about this. but otherwise dump the bf and get a new best friend.|`|n8Db77zbaa	even if you took it to the cops, they wont have proof they were havig phone sex, and second, it wasnt physical.|`|7e8a79679077253ba19f7c7646511819aa	If it was only phone sex he wont go to jail. Just dump him, forget about him, and find a faithful guy.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Why is your best friend 12?  Do you think like a 12 yr old?  You should never send someone to jail for revenge but you should probably tell her parents that she's doing things like that.|`|NS57cIo1aa	wow, its rong that your boyfriend is cheating...but this is way more yur friends fault then his... she lied to him by 4 years..|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	LOL|`|MOALoKWdaa	play her own game. and dump ur bf

I am sure it will smooth over again.|`|EBXvl6Foaa	I definitely wouldn't recommend it! Just try and remember how you felt when your friend did that to you. <br>  <br>  If you feel bad about what you did, than try and leave a message on her phone explaining things and apologize. <br>  <br>  I hope things work out for you guys! <br>  Just remember that guys come and go all the time, but your true friends last forever. Don't give that up!|`|PdIRHRZgaa	you are growm for your age, and your also very nasty. EEEEWWWW|`|AA11235886	yeah i can tell u are 15..... immatureness... re-read what u wrote and think just a lil harder..... No wonder young girls of 12-17 are becoming pregnant with std's! OMG|`|r3O9XCSBaa	Your are way too young for this behavior (and your friends). sex is a major thing and have you ever thought about getting pregnant or getting a decease? It does not matter how much you know someone, you never know. Think before you do this type of stuff. And no offense at all, but if you are not careful (your friend too) but if you guys are acting like this taking each others bf's and sleeping with them, then you are going to get a bad rep started.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	Your question was is this bad and yes it is bad that you had sex with your friends boyfriend. <br>  <br>  So what if she did it to you?<br>  You should be more matture and be a better person than she was.<br>  The worst thing is that you expect her to talk to you when you apparently didn't talk to her "4 eva"|`|YrMRlWzyaa	You shouldn't be having sex! It's like it's a fashion or something, you don't know how much sex can affect you emotionally and mentally. You're not even old enough to begin to comprehend what you're doing.<br>  <br>  You and Tamara are not real friends, friends don't do things like that to each other.|`|SeblOwzGaa	you're both whores! grow up a little bit. its called waiting until your in love. thats what i did. you experience it with someone that would be there for you and still love you if something happened (i.e. getting PREGNANT!) sluts!|`|xYqqbBfDaa	you slut first making out is o k but sex is not a friends with Benifits type of thing also your to Slutty to like edward he my baby daddy haven't you noticed!!!!!!

z4c7zGKmaa	I've only baked cookies for one guy - My current bf.  And it was basically the same scenario as you - I told him one day that I was making cookies and he commented that he wanted some too.  I brought him cookies for our first date.<br>  <br>  To this day (over a year later), these are 'my' cookies despite the fact that his mother has stolen the recipe and makes them for him way more often than I do! lol|`|zzvDybEiaa	" The way to a man's HEART is through his stomach "<br>  <br>  To return the favor, Invite her out to lunch or dinner.|`|hnfTjH4paa	she was probably trying to be nice to you, she remembers you said something about it, so obviously she did it for you....who knows she probably likes you more that you think.
4Xv5NRsWaa	usually its a one shot thing; you have to wait for the perfect moment! its hard, but it's always there<br>  <br>  ask her out on a day you know you can have a chance to be with her alone, then build up the atmosphere by hugging her or embracing her close to you then tell her how shes really important to you, and thenn some sparks should fly :)|`|4eEkBfItaa	When you are hanging out alone, right before you say goodbye give her a hug. But instead of pulling completely away keep her in your arms. then look into her eyes and just ask her. ask her if it would be ok to kiss her. either that or just go for it. if she loves you like you say she does she will not deny you, maybe she is afraid of the awkward space before and after a kiss ( trust me there is awkward space ) so if the best thing for her is to surprise her go for it! <br>  Good luck =]|`|dltzzsCraa	When my boyfriend first kissed me he said "would it be okay if I kissed you?" it was soooo sweet, and it didnt' feel like he was presumptious because he asked. of course i wouldn't have minded if he didn't ask, but it just made it THAT much more sweet and made me feel like i could really trust him. I fell SO hard then and there :)<br>  whatever you decide, good luck! :)|`|8aZC3PSaaa	i think you should ask her on a romantic date like the movies and make it a good one you want to see and then in the middle of the movie go in for the kiss and after just act natural|`|QnQ39o4Raa	real easy...ok not so easy but still.<br>  When you guys hang out like at each others house or something give her a peck on the cheek and if she seems real cool with it then slowly go for her lips. Shell follow if she really wants to kiss you.<br>  super good luck buddy hope things go super great! :)|`|rJ3eRddfaa	just tell her to close her eyes and go for it. be creative dude!|`|MDpXUrRKaa	Wait for a moment when you are both really happy (not like laughing or anything!) and JUST DO IT. Be careful not to bump her or anything.<br>   Good luck to you!|`|Wa6pdoVfaa	Make sure u guys are on your own, dont hav friends around, it will only make u nervous. <br>  Go for a walk or somthin. When there is no one else around, just kiss!|`|rIFqv8nvaa	When your about to leave, say i love you babe, grab her gently, move in slow, close your eyes and kiss her! NO TOUNGUE first time!!!!! After say i love you again and walk away. Do not look back. Just keep walking. Enjoy!|`|3TQCwtxJaa	Just go for it! Girls love a guy that's spontaneous and believe me, she probably wants it just as much as you so but is in the same predicament. Somebody has got to move in first, why not you?!|`|oThluLJJaa	Sit close and tell her to close her eyes. Kiss her if it feels right but have a back up plan incase it doesn't. She might say "Why did I have to close my eyes?" if you didn't kiss her. So maybe bring a flower or something. Just an idea, good luck :)|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	Firstly, it's my girlfriend and I, not me and my girlfriend. Do you expect us to tell you how to kiss your girlfriend?|`|pxTsBlOMaa	just kiss her|`|VjehSWF3aa	awwww thats so cute,just tell her this "this my sound funny but... can i please kiss you i cant help it" its dorky but she'll feel srry for u n kiss you nah am jk it'll be cute
kjtlfHqbaa	i think you need to decide who you like better.<br>  make a pros and cons list for each of them...<br>  thats if your best friend likes you in the same way *and you have a choice*<br>  but, if you do fancy your best mate more than your b.f its not really fair to lead him on any more unless you think you could make it work...<br>  <br>  hopee helpedd?
kcbEWzYwaa	When my bf and I first met we became friends. After two years he is my best friend and I'm his. He tells me that everyday. Also after two years of dating we are finally getting married. Although its not until next year we are still best friends. <br>  <br>  I agree that it is very important to build a friendship along with a relationship.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	No, my husband is not my best friend.  He's my husband.  People always say that your spouse or SO should be your best friend.  Well then, if that's the case, I guess I don't need to have romantic relations with him!!<br>  <br>  "I mean...when you're with a guy/girl don't you need to have that same level of trust, fun, communication etc. that you have with your best friend?"<br>  I have MORE of all those things with my husband than my best friend.|`|XZlFLecLaa	YES! my boyfriend and I are best friends also! I trust him more than anyone! he knows everything about me and i know everything about him... we do everything together and never tire of eachothers company... <br>  hes my favorite person and id be lost without him!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	My husband is my best friend...just think...if you had some amazing news who would you share it with first???<br>  People who marry "just" a GF/BF find themselves a couple of years down the line with little in common, after clubbing and sex dry up you have to have something in common and a deep rooted friendship...there is an awful lot of middle and old age to get through...be a shame to be with someone who wasn't you best friend.<br>  You are lucky and should feel very flatted :D|`|mYjtC4Graa	mines not, i don't know..it's just I know we aren't going to last forever, and that would ruin any best friend relationship.<br>  I know my best guy friend will always be there for me though.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	She use to be.|`|uczuLDzXaa	I have the same relationship. Me and my boyfriend are best friends. We have known each other since 6th grade and have liked each other since then too. It's pretty cool that best friends like me and him end up in a great relationship. He is the best boyfriend i have ever had and the Best friend i could ever have. He is really sweet and i am honored to have him as a best friend and a boyfriend. This is how my boyfriend is my best friend as well|`|dYGLyVpzaa	I think its good to have both, I agree. My boyfriends not my best friend but hes certainly one of them - we tell each other almost everything and just do friend stuff some of the time :) just having a girlfriend isn't on the same level, I think its important to see your partner as your friend as well - my parents always say that they are each others best friends which is what I think it should be :) although I do think that you should have your own friends too, having time apart is v important!|`|WGebRhqyaa	i'm my bf's bestfriend & i'm his. people that dont just have thier girlfriend & have a girlfriend relationship w/them vs best friends..best friends you tell EVERYTHING to & you always hang out w/them, can confide in them & tell them anything. some guys just keep it at girlfriend that they DO have trust, fun & communications with but not the type you have w/your bf.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I am in love with my best friend... I am also married to him.  It is great having someone so close to you that there is no need to hide anything, even the littlest of things we share.  It was on our wedding day when my old best friend did not show up that I realized I married my best friend.  I could be with him 24/7 and still want more time together.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	My best friend was a male friend, but I haven't seen him in 47 years.  We both married and went our ways.  Shame that - it's much easier to keep in touch with a best friend of the same sex because a spouse doesn't see them as a threat.|`|HomUui9qaa	That's because the boy is in it for the physical side of it, idiots. I consider my girlfriend as my best friend aswell as we always have fun and I trust her with my life. Some boys don't see that...|`|gqvvXknQaa	My BF is my best friend. I share everything with him.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	This can be a good thing and a bad thing. Why?! My bf and i have been together for 3 years, i consider him my best friend and the best bf ive ever had. Hes been there for me in good moments, bad ones... and he has help me out in rough times. He knows me and who's what i like and what i dont like. I can tell him everything and we can either hang out at home or go out to a fancy place. I like having two in one. The bad thing- If ya brake up for any reason, lets say one of you cheats or things aren't working out as bf and gf basically there goes a friendship. You can keep on being friends but threes still going to be feelings. I went out with my ex for 2 years and i consider him my bff and bf we broke up and it didnt work out as friends. He wanted to hook up with me and when i had a problem and would ask him for help me was too busy sweet talking to me so he can get me back or get in my pants.... but all i can say its ENJOY IT.|`|JG7Dlnm3aa	i just recently went back out with my ex, and he's been my best guy-friend for the past year (he was new last year), friends, bf/gf, exs and everything! we have been friends even when he was dating a friend of mine! i really think of him as a best friend, on the guy side. sorry, i have to groups of best friends, guys and chicks, cuz being male/female they are in a slightly different catagory than the other group. XD.<br>  ?s ya!|`|Ovcy6yv7aa	Yea! defiantly we were only saying the other day how good we are as friends and we consider each other bestfriends, its a good feeling innit. that you dont have to 'try' around each other and share each others lifes with each other.             I do know someone who just has a girlfriend and just has her just to 'have a girlfriend' and you ask you ask yourself what the hell are they doing together!                  I hope you two spend the rest of your lives together!|`|GSEslPnTaa	Yes, my boyfriend is my best friend in the whole wide world.<br>  Dont get me wrong though, i have many many girl best friends and i would be lost with out them. Having your Boyfriend consider you his best friend to me means that you guys have a strong relationship and that you guys can trust eachother and be yourselves when around one another. <br>  good luck with your relationship :]|`|324919bc63ea3d75096ebc1a25e22647aa	some people don't know how to be best friends while they're dating.<br>  me and my boyfriend were really good friends for years before dating, and then when we started dating we still had that friendship, but it was different. we broke up (it was very dramatic, breaking up usually is), but now i really feel like there isn't anyone else i'd rather be with at any time. and he's my best friend.|`|WwOCNY27aa	my boyfriend is most definately my bestfriend. I can tell him anything or vent to him for hours and i know he'll always listen, we can just talk and enjoy each other and we always tell each other that we're each others best friends. we trust each other completely an we've been going 8 months strong(:|`|yyMRQkEmaa	DONT DATE YOUR BEST FRIEND UNLESS YOU KNOW IT WILL LAST FOREVER! <br>  <br>  i have been there before....We really liked each other and felt like we could just be ourselves around each other.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Notice Differences. Everyone operates differently, so while the following clues can be good hints, the most important indicator is whether or not your friend treats you differently from her or his other friends. Regardless of whether or not your friend treats you worse or better, any difference could be a hint they have a crush. <br>  Eye contact. See how long your friend looks you in the eye for. If it's longer than usual, he or she may be looking for something more than friendship. As they say, the eyes are the windows to the soul. <br>  Physical contact. Does he or she make excuses for holding on to you, touching your hand, giving you a hug? This is usually a sign that a person wants more than friendship. This shows he or she wants to get closer to you and to hold you when you're both comfortable with it. <br>  Facial expressions. If your friend blushes when talking to you, it's a hint that he or she likes you. Just the same for smiling. If he or she smiles at you every time you look over, there's usually something going on. <br>  Nervousness. If your friend gets nervous while talking to you, it's a sign that he or she likes you at least a little. <br>  Use friends as a clue. If his friends tease him when he's hanging out with you, he's told them something he doesn't want you to know. Which usually means he told them he had feelings for you- or something of the sort. (not always though I am a guy and whenever my friends "tease me" around girls I am talking to it is just on hunches) <br>  Cleans up. Does your friend start to look nicer when you two hang out? Perhaps he or she wants to look nice for you and wants to impress you. <br>  Teasing. If your friend begins to tease you in a joking manner, he or she might have a crush on you. For example, your friend could be acting sarcastic when he says "nice hair.", but take it as a compliment because he probably means it.
Ka4Ql5r8aa	idk i cant really tell|`|lyMMjVNgaa	haha yes she likes you :)
oDtuygT6aa	its probably because you have grown up with some of the guys from school.<br>  & people act alot different in classrooms than they do at walmart.|`|gqvvXknQaa	You just might be attracting a certain type of guy. Try creating a new look for yourself if you don't like the attention your getting|`|J7k4xJtoaa	Boys at school are different. More girls to look at plus their buddies are with them. They act different but they still look.
9U5GV6xmaa	I really don't want to hurt your feelings, but she sounds like she wants to go her own way. As a best friend, try and be there for her when she really screws up. She has met up with some dominant friends if she is listening to them. Good Luck, you sound like a keeper!|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Dude you are really in trouble.
mwEBrwlOaa	I disagree with most of the posters here. It is common for wife to suggest a threesome and it maybe she feels comfortable with you. In my situation there is a 7 year gap between our ages and she was the one who suggested having a threesome. From experience I can tell you there is a big difference between suggesting a threesome and actually having one. To have a threesome that works from my experience it requires talking and agreement. So she is interested at this point in time  in having one but she may change her mind as the two of you talk about it.  <br>  <br>  One point for you to consider is your wife bisexual or at least bi-curious? The reason for asking is her age and the type of threesome she wants. Usually, though not always, I have found if a woman suggests a threesome it is mfm unless she is bisexual. I wonder if she is trying to bring up the fact she is bisexual with you?  <br>  <br>  For you it will be important for you decide on your feelings about having a threesome and then communicate it to her. My advice to you is to talk with your wife and share your feelings with her.|`|wzAhxdpKaa	It might sound fun, but I would think long and hard before you actually get serious about doing it.  I've know people who had a great marriage and just wanted a little spice in the bedroom.  So, one partner talked the other into a threesome.  It ends up causing so many problems that cannot be repaired, it's the fastest way to a divorce I've seen.  Proceed with great caution.|`|buHzPMHZaa	It's a common fantasy for married women. Making the fantasy into reality is another matter.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	I wouldnt say it was 'normal' .......but that generation has a whole different view on sex.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I don't think its normal. <br>  I do see a lot of younger people on here that think its ok. Actually its really disturbing. I see so many younger people on here who are so casual about sex. I think that this is due to a lot of media making it seem like normal behavior. I think that this will lead to problems for them later in life, such as not being able to settle down in a committed relationship with one person. Kids just don't know any better, although im sure they will tell you they do.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	I've thrown so many fantasies at my husband I'm surprised his head doesn't pop clean off.  However, some of my fantasies are just that.  A fantasy.  I don't REALLY want to do it, but I really want to talk to him about it because it turns me on.  <br>  <br>  Since you have such an open dialog with your wife, ask her if she is serious OR if this is just a talk thing.|`|1epjqrflaa	I dont think its normal, but everyone is different. I may fantasize about having another  chic in bed with me and my man, but when the time came  I know I would kill the bitc*.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	its perfectly normal talk...|`|kbz5S3waaa	she might be testing you? Tell her she's all the woman you need. It's more acceptable these days, but i'd never do it (I'm 21)|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You know...I'm 29...so I'm at the midpoint between the two ages.<br>  <br>  And I'm becoming convinced that everyone under the current age of 25 is a little sex-pot. <br>  <br>  Seriously. Ten years ago, I would of have said it was a test. These days....I just don't know. <br>  <br>  Whatever the case, you can't go along with this.

kwgheTHEaa	You should tell your parents. Many parents only do this for the GOOD of their children, but maybe they didn't know that they were overworking you. They want the best future for you. (wow SAT study in 8th grade??).<br>  <br>  But you don't want to quit anything right? So why not keep a schedule. An hour of this, a half hour of that, leave two hours for free time. Try to balance everything out so that you are not overworked!|`|AA11185479	You have two choices: manage your time more efficiently, or remove some of your activities.<br>  <br>  If you're in the 8th grade, there is no need to study for the SAT yet!  You won't take the SAT for several more years, and if you're a good student in general you will score just fine with only a few months of dedicated preparation.  <br>  <br>  Look at the big picture.  The testing and the contest are both short-term goals.  They will be finished by a certain date.  The piano and violin are activities you can enjoy your entire life.  Even if you plan to make a career out of it, it won't matter if you reach the next level of proficiency next month, next year, or next decade.  So this is something you can postpone without harm.<br>  <br>  Have a calm talk with your parents and let them know that you are overloaded.  Tell them you would like to *postpone* (not quit) piano or violin or both for awhile so that you can focus on your academics.  Offer a specific schedule for when you will return to music.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	talk to your momma and/or dad and tell them about how your overloaded<br>  <br>  you definitely should NOT be taking the SAT's now- the earliest you need to do that is about 11th grade because in 8th grade, the stuff that is on the SATs, you haven't learned yet. if anything, you could study for the P-SAT's (pre-SATs).  [took my P-SATs when i was in 10th grade and will be taking my SATs in a little while, i'm in 12th grade, so there is deff. NO hurry to get your SATs done]<br>  also, if you enjoy writing, talk to them how you like to do things like that in your spare time or something like that<br>  <br>  in 8th grade, you shouldn't have that much to do, after all your more of a kid than anything else and what they are throwing on you is hard to handle with all the other stuff that an 8th grader goes thru

sEryEzoyaa	yes i m attracted to guys with longish hair!!! not the real long just the cute long that is popular now! they look sooo adorable!! lol guys with short hair can b cute too but all of the guys that i like have longish hair! lol|`|I5SypMlsaa	hair makes no difference if you are a chode<br>  <br>  How to Get Good with Women Quickly<br>  <br>  <br>  There’s a lot of ambiguity about the specific process that one must go through to go from chump to champ, in regards to women. Lots of times guys will run around in circles and waste time on pointless things. Then 5 years later, they still haven’t improved as much as they should have.<br>  <br>  In this article I clear the dust off this issue and give you a clear, concise method for getting good with women as quickly as possible without wasting time doing pointless things.<br>  <br>  Warning: The steps below take work. It is not easy. This journey will probably be one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. It’s also one of the most rewarding things. Having an abundance of beautiful women in your life is pretty awesome. It can take a LONG time, and lots of hard work, but you know what? It’s worth it!<br>  <br>  If you want to get SCARY good with women, as quickly as possible, there are 3 main things that you have to focus on: Attitude/Mindset, Lifestyle, and Approaches<br>  <br>  Attitude/Mindset<br>  No matter how far along you are in terms of your success with women (or in any endeavor in life), you should always keep your “student mindset”. Just because I’ve been actively working on myself for 2 years doesn’t mean anything. I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m still a student of the game and still learning every day. ALWAYS BE LEARNING. Try out new stuff. If you feel that you are “above” something or someone then you’re on the wrong track. You can be more experienced, but you’re still a student, and you’re always learning and getting better. This attitude is deadly and will help you improve much faster than the chumps who feel like they “already made it”. Stay hungry, you’ll see the difference.<br>  <br>  Approaches<br>  You’ve got to approach women that you don’t know and talk to them. Start with “Hey I’m Sean (insert your name)” and smile. Soon you’ll learn how to hold conversations, then how to get physical, then how to tease, then how to go on dates, then how to get laid. Eventually you will be getting laid very very consistently. It’ll freak you out how easy this process is once you get it.<br>  <br>  What you should do: Go out 3 or more times a week and meet women. Some guys can handle going out 7 times, some can’t. Figure out what works for you. You’re best bet would be going to night clubs and bars because there you’ll find lots of women to practice on. If you blow it with one girl, you can turn around and talk to another one right away. If you’re not old enough to go to clubs and bars or if you just can’t do it, you have to find somewhere else with a lot of women. You can try malls or bookstores. Go out 4x a week and approach 10 girls each time. Make a custom plan to fit your schedule. The more women you talk to the faster you’ll improve, which brings me to my next point…<br>  <br>  Lifestyle<br>  Women should be part of your life. Get more girls who are friends. You’ll approach girls, get their numbers. If it doesn’t work out, keep in touch with them anyway. After a couple months you should have way more girls in your phone than guys.<br>  <br>  Note: At one point I had to make an excel spread sheet because I forgot which girl was which. This is common, you’ll get it too.<br>  <br>  If you have a sister, hang out with her. Surround yourself with as many women as possible. Old, young, fat, slim, funny lookin’, hot, etc… The point is to get you comfortable with the feminine energy. Women will begin to feel more safe and relaxed around you simply from the vibe that you project.<br>  <br>  If you: are always learning, doing your approaches consistently, and hanging out with lots of girls everyday, your results with women (and self confidence in general) will skyrocket. In a month, you’ll see a major improvement, in a year you won’t even recognize yourself.<br>  <br>  Take the plunge, you’ll be glad you did.|`|lYIijzpQaa	I like short hair on men. Long hair either means they take longer to get ready than me (which is a problem), or they look metrosexual - and personally, I wouldn't want that guy as my boyfriend.|`|SayzCvX2aa	LONG HAIR is always good!!! :)
lQR9fYGhaa	aw =-)<br>  <br>  if you dont kiss on the first date,<br>  he'll be sure to ask you out again.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	How old are you. You may be a just a little to young to start dating,if so let it go for awhile. If you are of dating age all I can say is it takes maturity and practice to get over shyness. I know, I was painfully shy and the summer I graduated from High School I forced myself out of it because if I didn't I would never get more than 2 dates with a guy. Good luck.|`|AA11289793	That's normal and he sounds like a decentish guy seen as he wants to get to know you, and vice-versa. Just go for it, although don't expect too much you might have put him on a pedestal and he might not be what you thought...|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	it's way normal if he's your first. i agree with you wanting to get to know him first. if you just jump into a relationship without knowing the person, it can turn out badly. believe me, that's how it went with my first boyfriend.|`|iwE1QRKdaa	Yeah, that's perfectly normal.

It's normal. I don't know how old you are but it sounds like you are late teens or early 20s. I would say it is pretty normal to be nervous and scared but ask yourself a question: is it like NICE nervous and NICE scared? or do you really feel you would be in danger by going out with him on a date? If you are nervous and scared but still you feel happy about the fact that he asked you out then I would say what you are feeling is a positive thing, you just don't know how to handle it.<br>  <br>  My recommendation: accept going out on a date, but let him know that you want it to be a "friend" date, nothing more. Go and have some good fun together doing simple things like going to movies or bowling or going for an ice-cream. If he moves on too fast and wants to hold your hand or anything you don't feel comfortable with just let him know right away. The main goal of your date is to GET TO KNOW HIM a little bit more than you do now, NOT to start a relationship with him. It's going to be a start of a "closer" friendship, but nothing more than that. If you let him know that in advance and if you set that in your mind then you won't feel so nervous about having a BF on your first date. Dates are meant for get to know each other better. If things go well after a few dates then it would be kind of normal to start a "more formal" relationship, but there is no rule about it. You can go on dates with your crush 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 times and perhaps you will feel it's not the time to start a relationship. Your heart and intuition will determine when it's time to start something more formal. In the meantime, have fun (good, healthy and safe fun) on your date and take advantage of the opportunity to get to know your crush better as FRIENDS first.|`|6a7UKZVAaa	saaaaay yesss. <br>  just think that tons of people around the whole entire world have been in the same situation as you. and it doesn't matter what happends, just that you like this guy and he likes you and it's your first time !!<br>  =)|`|wnpcdfMWaa	You did the good thing by waiting to get to know him better and all you are feeling is normal.

Sometimes its fun to just expierence a new realationship.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	If the two are friends with each other stay away. Be very careful in what you pursue.

Being around a person like that helps you feel happier too.

However, quality boys/men are pretty broad-minded about what a girl looks like.<br>  <br>  With looks, it's not necessarily how slim a girl is or even how outstandingly pretty she is, but how well she carries off her shape and style, and what she is like to be with.  In my book, a slim or pretty girl who looks miserable or is a b!tch, is not nearly as attractive as a 'fat' or chubby girl who is loving, friendly, fun to be with and takes care of her appearance.  The latter would be much more likely to win me over.|`|yb01tlviaa	wide-spread legs.

JWSkzyQ7aa	Well, i can't actually say whether or not you can get him back. It sounds like with a little bit of time, and a sincere apology, the guy might put you back in his good graces, but wait... And here's some options i think would be good to do:<br>    #1. Call him and apologize for being all worked up about this "girl". Ask him if it's just better not to talk about it. If he accepts, *sigh of relief*.<br>   # 2. Give him about 4 days to recollect, call him, (email and texting aren't going to work, when u apologize, make sure he can hear your voice) <br>  <br>    Also, it's probably not a good idea to bring up girls all the time infront of your ex. If he brings up, than express yourself, but you can get him back, i think... but just don't repeat the texting thing. 'Kay?|`|gPeEdjmuaa	He is two-timing you.

So just talk to him about it and see  what he thinks =]|`|pOTigVYPaa	He's still your ex only he's playing you and the other girl.  You might really like him but it's obvious he doesn't really like you or he wouldn't be playing you.  Give him up and move on.

The two are mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  YOU seem to be the really good friend in this equation. If that is true, you deserve a really good friend too...so go and find one.<br>  <br>  Simply stop accompanying this persons everywhere. Next time she plans a holiday, have alternative plans, and follow through with *your* plans while she's off on her Holiday.<br>  <br>  So, stop being tarred with the same brush she is (because I can guarantee that since she is a selfish pain, you are likely her only friend, since no one likes her. Since you are with her, they think you are the same. <br>  <br>  Maybe if you actually go from friend to "once in a while acquaintance" ... and leave whenever she starts being nasty ... she'll actually realise what a you-know-what she's being and change. Probably not, but I've heard of more unlikley things happening, so it could happen!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

In the end, their results will vindicate him if he is innocent and that will be the end of it.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	yes. do not retaliate or respond to her. your fiance should ignore her as well. anything else would only lead her on and fuel the fire. just go on with life as if she does not exist.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	make sure you keep a diary of any event the you feel is relevent<br>  keep any court paper work including the one that got thrown out of court they are extreemly valuable.<br>  Do not be nasty towards this person it will only agrivate her more <br>  I any services come to see you regarding these false claims eg family services just be honest with them without being nasty towards any other parties also get some character referenced for keeps sake from people you may know eg teachers, police any one in law firm even a justice of the peace dont get them of family members & christian ministers they are held in high regards because they place there values very stong on families. these character references will be extreemly valuable.<br>  seek legal advice.<br>  Now this is extreemly important.<br>  If this becomes a court case dont do the foolish thing of being nasty in the court room just state the facts use yes or no answers unless asked to elaborate.<br>  Ignor all of her actions and false claims if she presents them to you or your partner or anyone else all she wants is to make you crack under pressure.<br>  Eventually people like family services will see that your family is very well balanced and she will get whats comming to her she will probably get fined for being a public nuisence|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	I would move.<br>  <br>  But if you can't do that, I suggest sue her.  You can get her for slander, false accusations, harassment, and emotional damages. I think she's quit then.|`|ph8IcueRaa	Lack of evidence is not the same as being found not guilty.  It sounds like there are more to these accusations than mere vindictiveness.
d29LsCccaa	just get one of your friends thats friends with one of his friends to tell him to meet you some where and ask him or get that friend to ask him : )
luBWSK3kaa	Tiffany, sometimes it turns out we make a connection of the heart at long distance, it does add extra challenges as contributors to my blog point out, but often results in a wonderful and long lasting relationship.<br>  <br>  My advice - if you feel for her, go for it!  Hell, I have wonderful relationships in five countries, all a very long way from here New Zealand (one is in Kamchatka, Russia!), Occasionally we get together and they all enhance my life.<br>  <br>  It may pay you to visit my blog and read a few of the posts and comments to gain a good understanding of how to move your relationship forward.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it!!|`|Ka4Ql5r8aa	why would you want to date some one in another country when you can date someone next door?
sCr2iTczaa	Because she is a b*tch and she has nothing else better to do with her time then be a home wrecker. She is probably just really jealous of you and wishes she could be as pretty or as cool as you. Don't worry about the haters trust me you need them. You know you need them, because the only reason they hate on you is because you are probably smart or really pretty maybe both it is possible, you are probably laid back and have a lot of friends and you probably have some thing they want. But really don't hate the Player hate the game the player plays. But of course they are retarded and don't know this. The next time they come up to you and say some smart **** like that tell her thank you smile politely and walk away. You can't let her know that she is getting to you. It will fuel the fire and you don't want to feed the fire fuel. PLus if you show her she doesn't bother you she will leave you alone eventually. and it will make her made lol.|`|stCqLSSoaa	your sentence really doesnt make sense.

HArqQa8Maa	Wow ....mine is on 19th march.....<br>  <br>  It is always hard to talk to an EX.....When you are completely out of his life then why you wanna wish him........Find another guy and live a happy life coz by nurturing feeling for your EX will hurt you, and your future boy friend......<br>  <br>  If you dumped him then it would hurt him if you wish......it will remind him of the good times you had together and i think that way he will get rude out of frustration......<br>  <br>  If he dumped you then get some dignity....dont be so silly. When a person dumped you ruthlessly then how can you generate feelings for him....<br>  <br>  Either way dont wish him.....|`|1tLmTjBxaa	if he reats rudely ,dont be disappointed..prepare yourself|`|GoABmevnaa	I definitely understand what your saying. I dated my ex-bf for 3 years and when we broke up I was devestated and wanted to do everything I could to talk to him still or be with him again, which was the problem. <br>  In order to get over him (if that's what you want) maybe it's best to just not talk to him for a while. It will be VERY hard, but it gets better over time... trust me. It took me 1.5 years later and a few relationships later and I'm completely over him. you will be too, but it just takes effort.|`|R0ncW2wNaa	first of all ask a question to u?what do you want?do u want to restart the relation?is it possible?what will u get with it?if u have closed a chapter then let it be closed.and if u still love him then will u accept him with all his good and bad?and if u r still confused,close ur eyes ask god give u a clue so u can find a solution.|`|KtCs2Ftxaa	hi baby when u thinked to wish him itself u still love him, never mind wat he says just move on and say ur wish to him , as a boy i say boys will never be rude when someone shows loves to them......<br>  so if u wish him on his b.day he will not be rude......|`|de4dJ0cxaa	WHAT U HAVE IN UR MIND & HEART DO THAT ......DON'T BE SCARED FOR ANYTHING.O.K DO IT.|`|5bT5VFgZaa	Okay, don't make such a big deal out of this. It's easier said then done, but just go up to him and tell him happy birthday. Or in the hallway, just walk by him and quickly say it so he cant be rude to you. If your that nervous that you cant tell the guy happy birthday then you need to work on your self confident. Trust me, it will all be okay. Its just two little words.|`|AA11339466	Wish him, suppose he goes rude, cut the phone line...<br>  <br>  To my understanding, he also misses you and he won't be rude. Call him yar, and do what ur heart says.|`|6c2ffa6f629502790dc24e46da38b327aa	well.<br>  i texted my ex on valentines day,  around dinner time. <br>  And we talked until 730 am.. and got back together.<br>  <br>  even if he does react rudely, you'll be on his mind for awhile.

Every one of us is different.  One piece of advice I can give you is to be confidant and don't try too hard.  If you get shot down by a girl don't let it crush you.  Figure it will happen a lot in life before you find THE ONE.  No matter what you NEED confidence.|`|lNqkzsdCaa	you can get into the things she is into.or try to make her notice you.|`|URusy62Iaa	look her in the eyes, and make her laugh.

Would you want some loopy obsessed psycho guy stalking you when you've made it clear you don't want him?<br>  <br>  Behavior like that is just asking for more rejection, if not a getting slapped with a restraining order!  If you're really that fixated, then maybe you should get professional counseling to help you break this unhealthy obsession for another person.|`|d698564bfbe2b2637c23d5d70d252414aa	Sorry, you can't force someone to love you. If he really doesn't return the feeling you're going to have to get over him, regardless of how in love you are.

FROfw46Yaa	19, F<br>  <br>  We want to feel loved and important, and we want to make our partner feel the same.

4EWCegiRaa	All relationships go through their ups and downs.  Maybe the problem isn't that he's bipolar, maybe it's just how you feel since you have depression and anxiety.  You have to remember... your opinion is biased because of your situation.<br>  <br>  Could he be more understanding?  Yes.<br>  Could he be less stressful?  Yes.<br>  Could it just be you?  Yes.<br>  <br>  Hang in there and take it one day at a time.  No need to rush into a break up or a non-break up.  You've only been fighting "lately", I think you should be concerned when you've been fighting "for a while".|`|FNVc83Hdaa	Maybe the two of you could try some type of couples counseling or therapy. If that doesn't work, then maybe go your separate ways.
783a8e4bcc7cfa46074ead476e24dee1aa	Take it slow, don't go straight into a relationship. If you give it time then it will give him enough time to get over his ex for sure. Until then continue to date him and talk to him. Try not to get too attached because there is a chance you are the rebound girl but from what you said it doesn't seem like you are.|`|MOALoKWdaa	it depends....if he goes back with his ex then yes your the rebound girl...let time pass, be patient with him. dont rush the relationship. be girl friend material to him get close but not to close and set your boundaries

As in, they don't really pay attention to them if they aren't interested. If he doesn't date boys then I think texting you means a definite YES!<br>  Hope I helped :-)|`|vVrEpmJqaa	He definetly likes you!|`|wRRU7xlkaa	He Loves You So Bad..!<br>  <br>  ASK HIM OUT!|`|gJPlY1ADaa	yea he definitely likes you....go for it.....ask him out
zChpODnnaa	K, if you like him, and you want to go out with him, tell people like your close friends and like tell them to tell him if he would go out with you and he'll say either yea or no or Idk, to your friend so atleast you know what he thinks, and don't let him make all the moves, make it kinda easy for him to get to you, cause I like girls that aren't scared to make moves and like get a lil flirtish so yea. <br>  But if you don't want to go out with him cause it'll ruin your relationship that that's probly the best thing to do but at the same time you can like be best of friends and almost seem like youre going out but not.<br>  Good luck ;P|`|64ad6a825c406631888459cff69ff10aaa	Yep|`|I8SjPyeBaa	maybe he said no cause he thought you didn't like him back.|`|q8pV5Ry2aa	yea

I think the best way to meet boys is through friends. Ask friends if they can hook you up with anybody or another great place to meet guys is at school sporting events, like basketball games.<br>  <br>  Just be confident and smile a lot. A guy isn't going to want to approach you if you appear standoffish. Good luck! =)|`|aSYENznYaa	call me ;P<br>  <br>  joke<br>  <br>  you need confidence....if it's something you don't have, anyway it's something you'll get with practice.<br>  <br>  to clarify what megan said (below): if you stand back you could come across as not interested<br>  <br>  but at least if you try to talk, even if you appear shy that's cute.|`|DP9HbnrXaa	you cud go to youth clubs or discos for under 18's. also you could meet fellas over bebo or msn kinda thing? get to know them n then meet up and see what happens..<br>  hope this helps!
YrMRlWzyaa	The only reason he's being nice is so he can get away with being racist towards you. Don't put up with it for even a day longer, you shouldn't have to defend what side of you is English and what side of you is Japanese. Always be proud of who you are and don't ever let anyone belittle your race...|`|IdNRyzXlaa	He is a non true friend...but i think u have caught that already. His true personallity is really the rascism kind. On the bus he is trying to act of a friend just in case others r around and get offended too, at least thats wut it sounds like. Also, does he have differ. friends on the bus and at school school???? Because if he does, that could be the prob. Maybe the boys at school think ur dumb, no offense- that could be wut they think, u know people??? And then friends on the bus that DO like u. Maybe its the way he is raised. If he says another comment dont say a mean comment back just go, "Dude, dont try showing off with those comments. Do u see any1 lookin at u when u say that??? No. So there is no point of saying it even if it doesnt hurt or bother me." Just walk away and that will leave him speechless. Try saying that next to where u school room is so u dont have to walk down the halls with him chasing u. And on the bus if he acts nice like move seats and tell him, "Woa, im not falling for that after wut u told me today(yesterday; other days). And get up and move. If other people see him they'lll wonder wut BAD thing the boy did. No matter wut, even if u have assigned seats, ask to change ur seat because of the boy that sits with u. Dont fall 4 it when he acts nice- its all an act even if he apoligizes he still has the ability to do it again. GOOD LUCK.
JsBk6NFSaa	because guys need to feel superior and they want to solve your problems. It makes him feel like a real man. To keep a happy relationship, I think you should just nod and let him lecture on... it will make him happy and it does'nt mean he thinks you are stupid or anything!|`|UI79JnJVaa	"He must be the 'Bread Winner' in the family."

There is nothing wrong with her asking questions. If you answer then just remember she's learning.<br>  <br>  But you did just refer to her as stupid, if you can't live with it then I would break up with her because it's obviously making you angry/ annoyed...|`|4E6rrI09aa	no offence but you're a bit stuck up, do you even love her? That's a question I would ask because I don't have a clue what the answer is!
iPNOVR6Gaa	If his coldness turned you cold, maybe if he showed you warmth it would warm you up too.  Tell him that if he wants you to start acting normal again, he needs to start treating you warmly.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Try spitting it out. He will understand.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	you need to tell him to shut the hell up, and listen to you.<br>  tell him that the only way it is gonna work is if he shuts the hell up and does eveything you tell him. tell him you have the right to cuss him out everyday, all day long. and he can not tell you a dam thing, and he needs to ask for forgiveness all the time and that he will never get it untill you put him though hell and misery like he has put you though and then, maybe, after a few months, you might be able to stand him long enough to give him another chance.|`|5gWDZVp6aa	i think you need to firstly forgive him for the pain that hes put you through as thats the reason as to way you are reacting to him this way, u put yourself out there and he rejected you. you need to tell him how your feeling and how much he really hurt you! ask him why he did act so cold?! you will make it if you both talk openly to one another!! talk talk talk is the key|`|89UOqaVNaa	Watch the movie "Fireproof" together. It really opened my eyes to what I was doing wrong in my marriage and helped a lot.<br>  <br>  Things are great now!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Sorry....read the initial part of the question and I haven't been able to concentrate since.  Darn dirty mind.  Gets me in trouble sometimes.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you feel that you can't talk to him or even look at him and you just want him to leave you the hell alone, I recommend talking to someone you can look at.  Go to a therapist for a few sessions alone and figure out why you can't bring yourself to look at him or talk to him.  Since you haven't explained what got you to this point, I can't really advise you on anything else.  And to be honest, I think some therapy to try and figure these things out would be benificial even if you did explain further.   <br>  <br>  After you figure out where you are at in your own mind......try to talk to your husband.  Try to fix things.  Try to communicate.  If you still can't, couples counseling.  Write him a letter to try to explain.  Do something, because by doing nothing, you are failing your marriage....|`|n5FtYIM3aa	Hmm...I actually went through the same thing with my ex husband.  I couldn't stand being around him, couldn't stand looking stand looking at him.  It got so bad that i was just looking for a fight.  We even tried marriage counseling and that didn't work.  It went to so far that i found any possible way to end our relationship....i cheated.  So honestly, before you continue to make yourself miserable you should separate and maybe you will find yourself missing him, and then only then will you be able to stand him..or in my case, i fell out of love with my ex....
YkLpqHJEaa	Eat her special chocolate bars. I did that to my ex girlfriend. She became really annoying, and refused to let me eat any of the food that she bought. So I ate her chocolate and she left me.|`|kdBhSqqfaa	Do little things that annoy her. Fart a lot in front of her. Make your nose whistle a lot. Be a gross guy around her, walk around in your boxers scratching yourself. She'll soon mend her ways!|`|nOowkd3aaa	well what if you set several alarms to go off in the middle of the night and then faked you were asleep so she has to get them. also if you share a bathroom leave toothpaste on the sink, makeup out, toilet seat open/shut(depending on which one she hates). turn music up while she tries to go to sleep and a small lamp on(tell her your studying and the music helps. I hope this helps!

hbvIZPrQaa	Your mom is right but what you are feeling are your emotions.  Your body is reacting to his. But what you are feeling is called infactuation.  Your mom is saying that you're too young for love because love is unconditional.  Meaning you love/accept the person no matter what.  No matter, what they look like, smell like, say, do,etc.  Love is not based on the physical.  Since you're only 14, you haven't come into your self yet and got to really know and love yourself before you can truly love someone else. Love is what your mom has for you, meaning no matter what you do, you could do anything to make her not love you.|`|rRZA8nPTaa	if every time you see ur bf do you get really happy like it was the first time seeing him. if so you are in love

sPQBluKEaa	if you're saying he's a player, he probably was leading me on. in eigth grade, i was in love with a player and i was very convinced that he liked me. after months of me thinking that he liked me and was flirting with me, i found out he was just leading me on. if you know he's a player, then just forget about it. think about someone else.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	well you said he's a player so personally i say don't go there, if u feel like he;s messing you around now then if u went out with him he wud still mess u around now. no one knows if he was messing you around, guys like that are complicated. and if he went out with ur mate, split with her and he says he regrets it, the he obvs likes or says he likes her and not you, my advice, just don't get involved, it's sounds lyk too much drama tbh!<br>  <br>  hope it helps x|`|yrxENGqbaa	No he is a player he likes all girls for a while then stops liking them don't go for it|`|JHUT3Sqtaa	move on. its going to be reallyyyyyy hard but it will be better for you in the long run(: Believe me, been there, done that!|`|xreWOKBYaa	if he is a player, he will never love any one woman.

qRM0r7eVaa	From having asked that question before I would, if your really worried..or just sit and down and tell him to tell you whats going on.<br>  When I asked my bf this he told me everything that was wrong and really opened up and we didnt break up.|`|PfQJoAwraa	never ask guys that.  that is one way to get them to dump you.  just make sure he knows you luv him kiss him, hug him, cuddle up to him.  guys just sometimes need a little break every once an awhile that's all just don't freak out.
Hk39AkNGaa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsIf you like him and you are confident, ask him out. <br>  The Clock Test: To see if a guy has been checking you out, abruptly look at the clock, then look at him really fast. If he followed your eyes to the clock, he was staring at you and was startled by your sudden movement that following your eyes is a reflex to them. <br>  If he seems comfortable talking to you about other girls, he probably does not like you in that way. Either that, or he is trying to make you jealous, which might mean that he likes you but doesn't reflect too well on his character. Or he could be trying to see if you like him. <br>  If his ex girlfriend hates you, she might be onto something!|`|RLthetaLaa	it looks like he does. just ask him for it.just like that|`|hft0zMK3aa	he likes you, and if youre friends then tell him you guys should hang out somtime then ask for his number
JMF4rZT8aa	that is a big load of cumm... the sex must have been good lol.  u might want to get him checked for stds|`|pe9502BAaa	I hope he doesn't have anything??? *** was not meant to be shot in your eyes so of course your eyes would be irritated give it a couple days and rinse them good and you should be fine. Don't forget to get checked for std's every month.
BAPFfYeAaa	in my opinion cheating is cheating, be it separated or not, she is still very much married to you and shudnt have slept around whether it was a man or a woman....im sure this changed ur relationship forever..try having this discussion with her and yes, mention ur children adn appeal to her emotions, ask her for a direct answer of whether or not you shud try to work things out or not..i hope you two work things out! bless!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	I personally wouldn't be able to handle that. Some guys think it's hot, but cheating is cheating regardless of whether it's hetero or homosexually. She's also leading a double life, which I would not be able to handle as well.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	The best thing to do is to leave the lying dyke as soon as possible and don't look back.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	invite her girlfriend to join the 2 of you!

Don't bother with her!
ESsQeH8Aaa	Actually,  it IS easy to do.<br>  <br>  But it isn't something that YOU can do for him.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend made a classical error in the relationship by asking about your past lovers/boyfriends/whatever ... when he really didn't want to know.   YOU errored by telling him the truth, but that's more like a rock and a hard place.  After all, what were you supposed to do,..... lie to him?<br>  <br>  Of course not,  but now you get to deal with all the jealousy and resentment he's putting out because of your honesty.<br>  <br>  Oh well.  What's done is done.   So what do you do about it?    Literally, .... nothing.  There is nothing you can say or do that is going to alleviate his feelings about your past.   If he is going to "get over it", then HE has to do it.<br>  <br>  You can ask him one thing that just might help him get over it.   2 things to know here.   1) You have to be ready and willing to terminate the relationship if it doesn't work.  and  2) ... It may not work. <br>  <br>  So, what is the thing you can ask him?    "Honey, are you willing to end our relationship over your inability to forget about MY past?"  <br>  <br>  If he says "No."  then he's on his way to forgetting about it.  (may take some time, but be patient)<br>  <br>  If he says "Yes."   Then you say, "what a considence,  so am I."<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, the jealousy and resentments he's feeling today are only going to get worse as time goes by.   So if things aren't going to have the hope of getting better, why should you continue investing energy in a lost cause?|`|aJTBF7opaa	sorry to say but sounds like its not going to last. He sounds like a very insecure guy, and by this he will only push you away by speaking negative all the time. I am a very blunt person so i would just tell him like it is. Kinda sound like you have, but tell him fighting over not loving???? when u say you do is no reason to fight, if he cant except the past is the past and that you do love him and think the world of him, all he will do is push you away. if he cant except it there is nothing that will change his mind hes just that type of guy.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Can he forgive your past indiscretions and move on with your relationship?<br>  That’s a tough question since there’s nothing really there for him to "forgive". You haven't done anything to him.<br>  <br>  The real question is… can he embrace the love that you have been blessed to partake in, or is this self created issue of his more important to him? Important enough for him to give up your love and move on?|`|3kAAU1DYaa	It sound like he needs therapy...and I say that in a good way. He will destroy any relationships he has because he can't stop analyzing the past. If you want to save the relationship then get stricter about him bringing it up anymore and ask him to talk to someone....this gives me a bad feeling..almost possessiveness like...|`|7z9eKO2maa	if he doesn't believe you then he doesn't deserve you... trust is a HUGE part of love, and if he doesn't trust you he doesn't love you... you can't see life without him because he's taking up so much of yours, if you step back and get him out of the way, you'll see the rest of your life right there, happier than ever... he's standing infront of you, a true lover should stand beside and walk with you down the road your life gives you. give him one last chance to believe you, then if he doesn't believe you you should break it off... don't tell him what the concequenses would be though ok? if you do he'll just say he's forgetting it so he'll still have a toy...<br>  good luck|`|hF6uZqWRaa	I bet is hard. This weekend I found some old letter from my bf ex... I wanted to read them but i rather not know. That was the past and now hes with me. He never talks about his past relationships, i do. I dont know why. I guess i like to be open and let him know everything about my life since we been together for such a long time (3 years). But sometimes he uses that against me and i constantly remind him that it was a long time ago and its the past and that i didnt know him at that time. Your just going to have to keep on telling him... ITS IN THE PAST...and hopefully one day he will click and get over what ever you did in your past. good luck. btw im 20 and my bf is 22.|`|0mbv4AHJaa	It's hard, that he is holding you accountable for simply living your life. I'm in the similar situation but it's with my ex, I want to get back together but he doesn't want to let go of the fact that I have had a life when I wasn't with him--besides the fact that he went to france and stayed with an old high school girlfriend. <br>  I don't know what to say. I don't think there's an answer-other than he just needs to grow up. As does my ex...just grow up and get over it, as it shows a different level of maturity if you can deal with the past of your partner<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -and another thing *what he doesn't know won't hurt him*<br>  if it's your past...he simply doesn't need to know it's none of his business

LS8LcuRaaa	" i do everything for him" That is exactly the problem! Guys don't like it when the girl does everything for them. Where is the excitement?? He needs to feel a little unsure about you, he needs to think about you and wonder what you're doing. You're always right there and do everything for him, so he becomes bored. Guys are hunters. They need excitement. Even when they're in a relationship they still need to feel that thrill. So, stop doing everything for him and concentrate on yourself for a bit. Go out with friends and don't initate contact all the time.. give him the chance to miss you. What's going to happen if you don't call him for a while? He'll wonder why you haven't called. Only then will he think about you and maybe pick up the phone.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	You need to sit down and talk to him. Ask him where do we stand? And where do you want this relationship to go? You both need to be on the same page. To me it looks like he's comfortable with the relationship so now he's all laid back about it. Maybe you need to back off so he can miss you. I know it's easier said than done. But you are very young you have nothing to loose, beside a deadbeat if he is one. Please don't do everything for this man, that is what he'll get used to and the expect from you all the time. He needs to step up to the plate too.|`|F4QbDttoaa	MOVE ON, relax it does not sound like he appreciates you anyways, and if afer 10 months things are cooling off, he might not be the one.  Starting college is a busy time and your young yet.  Spend some time on yourself and enjoy your friends for awhile.  Let time fly and enjoy life eventually he'll come around, or mabey you'll find someone you love more!  And just a word of advice you should never do more for a man than they do for you.  Someday you will find the one.  Thats the whole point of dating!|`|rJ3eRddfaa	like u said, u r afraid it's going to fall apart. maybe he feels the same way and doesn't know how to react. try talking with him and say what u have said here.|`|4Xv5NRsWaa	been there too..<br>  <br>  ask him. the best thing to do is to ask him, what's wrong, whats up with him. tell him that youve been feeling a little distant from him lately and ask him what's wrong. if he says its nothing without an explanation then something SHOULD be up and he just doesnt want to tell you. what i would do is to keep asking him; if it ends up that he seems to have a little problem, talk to him about it. reassure him that youre always there for him and make. him. talk. very important.<br>  <br>  as long as you both communicate, it wont fall apart. best of luck|`|jlUczlQZaa	Ten months is not really long for a relationship, usually the first 6-12 months are spent getting to know each other and you are both usually on your best behaviour.  It appears that maybe he is realizing that he is not as interested in continuing the relationship or maybe he is just comfortable in the relationship as it is without constantly having to see each other and the freedom to focus on his other interests.<br>  <br>  You should be able to talk to him about anything and I think you should tell him exactly what your feeling.  Focus on yourself and give him some space to see what he wants and re-evaluate what you want.  <br>  <br>  If it is meant to be you will come to a mutual decision about where you want your relationship to be when you go to college, either a break or a definite committment to continue it.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	possibly...|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	It sounds like he's trying to take things slow. It's a good sign for sure though. Why don't you sit down with him and ask him what he's thinking right now. Whatever he say's, try to be ok with it and just give him time to come around|`|WLsS5vxsaa	It sounds like might want to get back together.<br>  If you want the same thing here is a website you can check if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com</a>
uBssj3Znaa	He is obviously a douche bag, who doesn't plan on doing any of these things (Getting a job, car, place to live and so on) because she is allowing him to be this way with no repercussion. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't want him living off of her anymore she needs to tell that loser to take a hike but I guarantee he will just find some other woman to take care of him.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Sounds like he's got it made. He will live off her as long as she lets him.  Why would he leave?  A whole year and he doesn't have to pay any bills, buy food, clothes...nothing?  He's got it made...  I wouldn't leave either. I bet she even leaves her car for him to drive while she's at work.  She's stupid and tell her I said it!<br>  <br>  Tell her to get a backbone and kick him to the curb.  He's got somewhere he can go but why should he? There's no motivation to get his act together, everything is free at her house.|`|SimAO1IUaa	i definately thats its time for her to dump his ***! she can do way better, i understand if she feels bad for him but if he hasnt tried to even improve then sorry hes on his own! and he should definately care she pays for everything he should man up and hes using her for sure. with all the money she spends on him, think about how much clothes and stuff she could be buying on herself!|`|ElSx2Mu6aa	Don't let them take advantage of you not all men are that way, if they have a health issue or extenuating circumstance that is one thing but they should be able to take care of themselves as well as a family, you can help each other for a while but he needs to pull his own weight|`|4L1c8kF8aa	I think she should give him 2 trash bags, 1 bag for his color clothes, and 1 bag for whites clothes.. and lead his sorry, broke, and good for nothing a*s to the back door,.. because he have not paid enough bills to walk through the front door....... Good luck|`|M63kq3AYaa	1. Her fault for letting it happen and getting involved with a waster.<br>  2. Considering women have been doing that since the dawn of time, who are you to complain?|`|dcbf3f0dfa7ae0ae446bea315e760b58aa	You can't help/change anyone else.<br>  Best way to be a good friend to someone who is making bad choices is to make the correct choices in your own life, and be a strong, happy example.<br>  Women have their own reasons for choosing men, none of which is any of your business.<br>  Control and meditate on YOUR choices for yourself, only.|`|AA11370724	I really hate to see and hear of people getting done like that,bc years of their life is wasted on someone that is not worth her time,emotions,and money. She could be doing bad by herself,why do she need someone else to speed the process? She doesn'tneed thaspreadof stress in her life.Only if she spreaded her wings and get a new breathe of fresh air and concentrated on herself and what means the most to her,then she'll come out of that rutt and be the Angel in all it heavenly splender that she is soppose to be.|`|4xrvZGdRaa	Ok two bits of advice, 1) Why doesn't she think she's good enough to get a real man?  one who lives up to his responsabilites and not a little boy who is just looking to be taken care of.. and 2) Ask her if this is the husband she wants for the rest of her life?  He's never going to change, ever.  <br>  <br>  Men are like this because there are women like your friend who will date and marry them.  If every woman he liked kicked him to the curb because he was useless, he would change.  But since he apparantly has no end to the supply of women with low self esteem who will date him.  Why should he change ? <br>  <br>  Tell your friend not to feel sorry for him either, there will always be another sucker to take her spot when she kicks him out.  Harsh but true..
4IhXjUpFaa	um okay lets see you are 18 hes 21...wow(sarcasm) its just a 3 year difference<br>  i mean you only feel like that because you still live with your parents<br>  but your 18! you shouldn't feel childish..This girl i knew was just 13 and she was going out with this 22 year old guy that is almost a TEN year difference...so yea you shouldn't feel like a kid|`|pE5E5L5naa	it just is.  its your body's way of telling you to be careful.  There are alot of pretendencies we have and they sometimes subconscious.  they're good and they come and go based on the way you were brought up|`|lUO6wLGAaa	He's not out of your league at all.  It's normal to have that kind of feeling at the beginning of a relationship.  Try to talk to him again soon, and let him know you're interested.  And then see where things lead.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	if you're optimistic, it should all work out.
bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	That form of stimulation is foreplay.<br>  You need to talk to him about how far you are willing to go, or he will see it as a tease.<br>  Teasing a male can cause pain, which in slang has been called 'blue balls'.|`|kTHIZPy5aa	He wants your jeans off!|`|Ii5udGmJaa	yeah , he expects a hj ,  if not more , If you aren't willing to go father then that I would be very careful and not lead him on. Because he will be wanting more then just a hj . If you continue this you may be leading him on , and not be knowing it at the same time. While he thinks that your going to be giving him a little something , something.<br>  So be careful and if you have to , clarify things.<br>  <br>  good luck to you <br>  hope it helped.|`|BZg5TFlqaa	he just wants to fondle with you girl. hell only have sex if U says its OK. hes just wanting to pleasure u. if u dont like it tell him gently not to. hes not really expecting sex unless u give the go.|`|deO9AIChaa	he is trying to initiate masturbation!!!|`|7z9eKO2maa	he expects you to take off the pants next time you're alone... don't do it until you're COMPLETELY ready though ok?
GkPeIQ9Maa	If That Were Me This Is What I Would Of Done Being That I Completely Respect Myself And For My Beautiful Self Image Of HIGH SELF ESTEEM That I Have..<br>  <br>  I Would Of Gave Him A Very Dirty Look.. Then I Would Of Told Him In Front Of Her That IM THE ONLY ONE HE NEEDS TO BE FLIRTING WITH OR CHECKING OUT!<br>  <br>  Low Self Esteem Image Would Be To DO NOTHING.. Get It?|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Him winking at a woman made you mad, not jealous. I'm so sick of people, mainly boys, mixing jealousy (which goes hand in hand with envy) and just plain anger or annoyance of a situation. I would be mad too. If he is dating you, then why would he even think about doing something like that? And it's obvious that you'd be mad about this. Any girl would. And about the self-esteem...that has nothing to do with it. In this situation, it is justifiable to be angry. But it is not jealousy. Talk to him about. But personally, the littlest of things can be warning signs. If he winked at her right in front of you, just imagine what he'd do if you weren't around.
Enlj7cQzaa	well, i guess tell a funny joke. (gurls luv funny guys)!!!!!!!  ask her if she has a cellphoine, then ask wat color, then ask her #. then, txt her and ask her out!!!!|`|gQyzJ76waa	Use Cocky Comedy made famous by David DeAngelo. This is the only way you will get her to be interested in you. Bust her balls in a playful manner. A good one to use is "I wanted to tell you something. You have something between your teeth" is a great one to start out with. If she has a gorgeous tan, ask if she sat on a barbeque grill. Show her you are the man. David DeAngelo's methods are the only way you'll get a girl to like you.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Forget the making out.So just go to the movie and as your  already at the holding hand stage.Then he'll want to hold your hand again.He'll get warmed up soon enough.
3wKGTZvAaa	Give him something that represents you two's friendship. Anything is fine, really, but just make it look special.
2YKUepLjaa	yes. every day.|`|h32OwXACaa	the only way thay i would feel that is if you have gotten your heart broken other then that love is great to be honest|`|8bP67U8Taa	Wow, 35 and first time falling in love? Great for you though! Your heart should feel the best at this time.. I'm not in love at the time, but I've felt that way. When there was nobody else that mattered but that person. <br>  <br>  Love is a beautiful and ugly thing.|`|47iY7d5Laa	Yes, that is quite similar to how I felt when I fell in love.|`|OC6ffEW3aa	that sounds more like your going through a heart break
JhvqUvlsaa	I would focus on your strengths and build on that. Work on your weaknesses and if you don't seem to be getting anywhere, chock it up to experience and move on. Or try again in a few months.<br>  Tell yourself you are valuable and get out and get some exercise each day; this will help lift your mood.<br>  Don't worry about what to major in when you apply for school; just go and see what feels right.<br>  Just try not to be down on yourself and tell yourself this too shall pass.
4S6V4sb4aa	You know what,, To hell with them people,, It sucks how people judge others by their appearance,, it  happens to me too. But i don't care anymore, i look it as their the one missing out.. If someone can't except me for who i am then i don't want them to except me at all.  Good luck to you and keep you head up..|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Maybe they see something about you that you are not quite aware of.......then again who cares.....once you are indeed a kind and decent person there is absolutely nothing that you should worry about especially when concerning strangers.  Keep your head up and aim to be the best!|`|AUsvrW8faa	Sorry to hear what you're going through.  Smile more, it will make you appear more approachable.  Smile, make eye contact and say hello to people - that will help.|`|BBtw9cmXaa	It's probably because of your clothes,|`|C6XzxjKvaa	Well if you have friends, that's usually enough right? But if people are scared of you, try becoming more friendly and approach them in a way they can't back away. Start the conversation with guys so they know you're not going to eat them and help out girls or talk to them more or something. You dont have to be friends with everybody, you just have to let them know that you're not a murderer/ghost. And I think ghosts are cool actually.|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	I use to have that intense look to people.  It was because my vision was bad and I could see things that were far away from me.  I unknowingly appeared to gave hard core stares but in reality I was just trying to see who it was.|`|9f44Wsz0aa	Well, the gothic look usually scares people in general. If this is your style, then don't worry about what people think. But maybe you would want to flash a smile at people every now and then, just to let them know that you are friendly.|`|b3ipH3gcaa	If i was still young and in High School, i'd want your phone number. Try smiling more and maybe a bit more outgoing! good luck sweetie|`|zZ3MGvPHaa	try sumthing new dont die your hair that darkest blck and get some skin toner well i hope the best happens|`|QU8LmOkNaa	it means that you look cool. wait a bit and boys will be bold.|`|dfPqakmsaa	Are you sure you aren't a vampire?|`|u4jmt2Scaa	are u like weird or something?|`|8FWcCdfkaa	im guessing your problem is that you've been stereotyped as 'goth' or maybe 'emo' a lot of people stay away from people who look like what they think is goth or satanist. i know from experience -_-' I mean how do you dress? preppy? punk? hippie? emo?   that might also add to what could scare them. It could be rumors, too. or maybe they're afraid of the people you hang out with. (that has a lot to do with it sometimes)  im not saying you're any of these things. And i dont care if you are cause i think labels are overrated and people shouldn't judge you and be afraid of you because of that and if they do well that's just their problem.|`|KpPmgiKiaa	Sometimes, if you're feeling like people are afraid of you, or that they don't like you, your body language sets them off. I myself, have for years though that people hated me. I found out two weeks ago that the reason everyone was intimidated by me was because I tensed up when they walked in the room, gave longing looks to people in groups, and just overall seemed unhappy. I've been told that I'm never seen with a smile on my face. I spent a few days being aware of that.. and discovered it's true.<br>  <br>  One of the most welcoming things in the world is a kind smile. Not the forced kind that makes you run for cover, but the real kind. Imagine sometihng that makes you really happy.. something that makes you smile. You'll know you've got it right when you almost feel warmth radiating from your eyes. I know it sounds dumb, or hypocritical. But that kind of smile can really, really help people through the day and maybe even gain you a new friend.<br>  <br>  If ever you feel you need someone who is non-biased, someone who doesnt know you and therefore can't judge you, or just someone who will listen, don't be afraid to friend me or drop me a line on here. <br>  <br>  I know what it's like to feel unwanted. And I hope no one else has to experiance it. <br>  <br>  Buck up, love. You'll find that once you're past High School, the drama tends to slow down.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Ok it's the BLACK hair...<br>  I have a friend who is naturally blond and was really getting weird looks or wouldn't get served in restaurants... when she went to Australia people wouldn't' even talk to her. (her hair is now red) <br>  <br>  i WOULD CHANGE the color of your hair (slightly) to something less severe.such as w/ streaks or dark dark brown  or red.<br>  <br>  It is the color of your hair ... even on "what not to wear" on TV they advised a girl to change from the sever color and people wouldn't be afraid. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Your desc. reminds me of a skinny, pale, witch who is vegetarian
V0xSZDBUaa	i don't think there is no real way to make out.... But for the most part all you need to do is just wait for that perfect time and look into her eyes and start to kiss don't think about it don't question anything just start to kiss and the rest will fall into play it will move smoothly....<br>  <br>  <br>  Have Fun!!!|`|quphzyDZaa	Stop asking this question so much|`|yelqyRLIaa	turn your head gently grab her face and open yout lips and kiss her its not that hard if you dont think about it too much
DcrI9zmkaa	I'm wondering why you think you have to tell him how you feel...???.  You say in your question that he likes you and you like him...why not just ask him to do something with you?  Invite him to a school ballgame or something.  No big, dramatic conversation necessary. :)
TBD6SPaTaa	Hi there,rihannafan.  Next time he treats you this way,Get his attention in a serious way.  Either yell out his name,Grab him forcefully and make him look at you.  Tell him that you will no longer be ignored.  And if he blames the ADHD,Tell him that you don't care.  It is immature and just plain rude.  If he is upset with you or angry with you for something,Fine.  But he's gotta let you know.  Let him know how you feel.  I was thinking another idea.  But then you'd be lowering yourself to his level.  You don't need to do that.  Please don't get upset over this.  I know he has hurt your feelings,Treating you like that.  But you will have the weekend to try to forget about this.  It's hard to forget,I know.  If someone treated me as if I was invisible,I'd be pretty upset with this person.  You shouldn't let this go unpunished.  You allow him to treat you like this,And he will think he can do it all the time.  And soon,He is going to disrespect you left and right.  rihannafan,You need to stand up for yourself and put your foot down.  If you need someone to boost your confidence.  I'd be more than happy to help.  I hope this answer pleases you somewhat.  I've gotta roll along soon.  You have yourself a goodnight,Okay?  Take it easy and God bless.  Bye for now.
RKQHRMusaa	friends, im not too close to my family.|`|Cq2CVuhcaa	family because my and my 'BFF" is fighting right now.|`|V2qyE68Jaa	sometimes friedns sometimes family but friedns come and go but family is always there for you so overall i would say family|`|XJrSbIV5aa	Family.

QareyZKfaa	Trust me... I understand what you're going through.  I've been in this situation a few times and it's really tough.<br>  <br>  What I did was find an activity that you can COMPLETELY dive into.  Whether it be reading, writing, dancing, singing, playing an instrument... something like that.  I preferred something artsy, but it can be anything, really.  Just when you DO find it, give yourself over to it and if it works for you like it worked for me, then you'll find that you are enjoying THAT more than you're worrying about the breakup.  <br>  <br>  I do hope that works... and good luck, love.|`|rpQjiaGOaa	How did you know it was going to turn unhealthy? If you're so in love I would say you're better off together than tearing yourself apart over him.<br>  But if you're convinced that your decision was what needed to be, hang out with your best friends, watch movies, play games, eat some of your favorite foods, make a little time for yourself and what you want to do. You've gotta give yourself a little time to recover.
WT9cjXtIaa	Several hours on a rainy Sunday morning sounds about right. It actually sounds real good, and the one good thing about rainy weekends. But normally I would think between 20 minutes and 45 minutes would be about right.<br>  <br>  Maggie... I sure hope so Babe, I need to spend some extra time in bed.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	What is it with you Brits?<br>  It is the average for you and your kind, you beasts!<br>  Especially when standing in a cowfield with bulls watching from a distance.<br>  <br>  Not that I would know from personal experience on August12th,1993.|`|GX41UJDiaa	well your about 38 minutes longer than me............thank God I'm rich or I wouldn't have any luck !|`|RluCMVUSaa	I would have to say that you have brilliant timing my friend... don't forget though that a rough quicky in a "borrowed" car is fun... when you keep them out too long when you return they are already suspicious and notice little things like stained seats and scuffs on the roof... so variety is best in all things including the time allotment for love making.  For instance in a restroom at a nice restaurant they always send an attendant with a key after about 40 minutes so at times short is just the only way to go. A long session is always a good treat but sometimes I really do want to make it to dinner...|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	You sound like you take much longer than your friends because you actually take the time to focus on the woman first. I do think that 3-4 hours is quite a long time...almost double or treble in my boyfriend's case!<br>  <br>  I don't think it matters, just as long as you and your partner are happy. She will let you know if she isn't. Don't worry about it, just enjoy it! Bravo I say!|`|TT0rCi8kaa	I know what you mean Mate, my Missus is a bit of a Moose too, and sometimes it takes me ages to get off!<br>  (Having a little background Porn running helps a little)|`|EE7sAaMlaa	thts definitely over average yes but not a bad thing at all! sex lasting 40 mins sounds great but the whole encounter taking 3-4 hours sounds a bit much, but hey i wouldnt be complaining lol.|`|53216puqaa	Until I'm satisfied, keel over with a fatal heart seizure or am shot dead by a gang of jealous third parties!|`|G6JXHvZKaa	depends,s on what you have!  and how long they can take it!!!!|`|qRM0r7eVaa	Stop bragging.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	Scoundy Love....If you arent busy later ....would you like to have a Play Date???<br>  <br>  HB...it looks like rain this weekend!!|`|SRZza0cWaa	OOOOHH.,.. i that you in the pic? ur well S.E.X.Y..x|`|TlnTKyXxaa	In my opinion...Well it's really a matt...wait sorry 40 minutes! 3 to 4 hours! You're actually concerned? My friend, you will receive no complaint from any woman. Any man that tells you it's to long is jealous.<br>  <br>  But to get back to the serious answer. So long as you and your partner enjoy yourselves, you're all right|`|DKeut6FQaa	Can I just say its my pleasure to answer this question...<br>  <br>  I personally believe sex should be an ongoing thing...like I would much rather be having sex while I'm typing this answer to you (preferably with your avatar) but I cant because unfortunately my job wont permit it. Well usually me & my hubby have sex for days at a time....only the sex is about 25min but the rest of the time is spent cleaning up the room...or the backseat of his truck....we can get a little wild!!!|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	How long is a piece of string??<br>  We are all different.<br>  <br>  The most important thing about your sexual relationship is whether you and your partner are satisfied or not. If you both are then that's wonderful.<br>  No two relationships are the same.

Okay maybe cut down the time in the tickling and teasing and see how that goes for you.  BTW is the tickling really involve the girl or Kia?  Just askin.....<br>  <br>  Yes CMP and that's just the sex part.  Not mine of course but the actual average.  Sad isn't it.|`|6U9b2t4raa	How long is " Dances with Wolves"?

Do not get me wrong, I am as big of a fan of Costner as the next guy, but enough is enough. <br>     Anyway, we snuck away when the lights went down and hid in my nephews bedroom...  sex on bunk-beds is amazing...so many places to grab hold... footholds and such....*drools* ...memories<br>  <br>     We made it back just as the credits were rolling.  Oscar winning performance I might add.
hmSb745iaa	You have to talk to him ! Really, please, for the sake of your relationship you have to talk to him ! He was saying he liked that other girl to get you jealous !|`|BbT3DCHvaa	I would try to talk to him and tell him how you feel.  If it comes to the point where you have to get over him, keep yourself busy. Answer questions on Yahoo, go out with friends and family, take up a new hobby or spend time on your favorite hobby. Time is going to be the only thing that will truly help. In the mean time stay busy. Good luck!
iVDGTaktaa	yes its normal. high school is a place where people find out who they are and where they fit. You'll meet new friends in no time :)|`|nAuMrPMxaa	Oh, i was like that too when i first when to high school. <br>  There is really no interesting group that i liked, and there were so many people, but later i get to know a few people in my class and were introduced to a new group that i later liked.<br>  So don't worry, just wait and see! ;)|`|o57O3yMlaa	No =\|`|ux9MGT4waa	it is completely normal i do the same thing just say ....

VYGHiQuyaa	Ask her why she wanted to hangout with you.

v4DfbDEQaa	maybe there not worth having as friends if they cant even talk to u|`|hjS7HA7daa	Your in the same boat as me, me and my twin was depressed for about 2 years when we had loads of friends, they got tired of it and left. We was happy with our 2 friends, the last 6 m8s ran away form us. So we just completely left, we regret it now as we have no friends, but they won't really be your friends? You have two choices, make some new friends, if you can coz i never cud as i have no confidence (hard childhood), or go on your own, why hang with people who don't like you? Or just tell your friends you was feeling depressed, and talk to them.|`|v4xIauuYaa	no wonder you got depressed sounds like you could of done with some decent friends not idiots like them. I wouldn't waste my time go find some new friends by joining a gym or something.
lIK9rUiuaa	you need to choose between the two. i'm sure your girlfriend doesn't like this if she sees it and you need to be honest with whitney if you don't like her and if you want to keep a good relationship with your girlfriend i suggest not hanging around with whitney|`|EyngB5jcaa	I'm known by group of friends as the backup.<br>  I hang out with mostly guys because I don't get along well with girls.<br>  So when one of my guys is having a problem with his girlfriend, we hang out, make out, have sex, whatever.<br>  Afterwards they usually feel bad about cheating on their girlfriend and fix things with her.<br>  Maybe you should try something like that with Whitney.<br>  Like sex with no emotional attachment.<br>  Only if both of you can handle that though.|`|pRDKYYV5aa	wow...|`|UzC9gsi0aa	You're a douche. You know that, right?|`|AA10542233	First: You need to sort our your feelings. <br>  Was your feelings for your girlfriend a lie? <br>  You've been with her for 4 years. <br>  Is it all a lie now? <br>  Which way are you attracted to Whitney?<br>  Emotionally or Physically?<br>  To me, it sounds like physically.|`|etFazHfXaa	Pick Whoever You Prefer<br>  If It Was Me And I Was A Guy<br>  I Would Have To Say Da Girlfriend<br>  Buh I Ent A Guy N Cant Think Like A guy<br>  HeHee :)|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	okay...than why don't you go out with her when you are "taking a break" with your current gf.|`|tZES73R0aa	I think that you should follow your heart
9QyrW2iCaa	#1 Ask some guy friends opinions on this----Pay attention to the GUYS -- the men who respond to your question.  Guys often have better insight into the actions/behavior of other guys.<br>  <br>  #2 I could present two common female things in response to this question:<br>    A)  Feel sorry for you and give you all kinds of pats on the back. Try<br>         to empathize with you and relate situations of my own.   OR<br>    B)  Tell you to try harder or be patient or psychoanalyze   EVERYTHING about this situatin to death trying to "figure out" why this guy is the way he is and does what he does.  <br>  <br>  I won't do EITHER of those because they are futile.<br>  <br>  #3  This is the answer and it comes from loads of experience.  He wants to fool around with you because it's fun.  He has no obligation to you.  He's young.  You're letting him play with you in your room -- so to speak.  As long as you let him, he will come over and play.  You have to ask yourself if this is really what you want or do you want a guy who likes you for who you are.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you for going to college.  Stay with it.  Do well.  No one can take your education away from you.  Your education and future degree will serve you.  This guy is not worth your valuable time.<br>  <br>  Take care and best of luck to you!
JSakTuOHaa	No.. Its been a week. Give it time.. Unless you detest the boy give him a break he's probably nervous to such a pretty one like you!!<br>  <br>  Just give it another week or 2 and if he's still acting all shy and your still completley annoyed with him. Break up with him. But dont be so harsh with him..  He doesn't sound like he's doing anything wrong.|`|z20FPXO8aa	It's a new relationship, give it time to become more comfortable around each other. A week is really a short time to be in a relationship, you should talk to him about how you feel lik hes not trying.|`|CkpzuduCaa	well i know how you feel nancy. i felt bad myself back then. but the ex and i buried the hatchet. well yes break up with him.|`|uVi9tpBxaa	So if a majority of us say yes you would break up with him...ur an idiot|`|I8H3PZ4Jaa	talk to him about being distance if he doesn't say anything kick him to the curb. i had a boyfriend that like didn't take the time to know me we had phone conversations just dead silence on the phone for hours and all we said was so... i tried to talk to him he denied it and i told him he didnt seem into me and broke up wit him.|`|B9dONyROaa	If you have to ask on yahoo answers then you shouldn't be in a relationship yet.|`|DlPFJur2aa	just ask him whats the matter. dont break up with him. maybe his pet just died and hes bummed out|`|lIYKAvvRaa	Not yet. Since it's a very new relationship, talk to him. If he still doesn't respond, end it.|`|tAQOcfA8aa	you should first hang out with him, just the two of you..and really try to talk to him, talk about anything and try to find things that you have in common. If that doesnt work, and you feel uncomfortable around him cause he wont talk, then its probably most best to be just friends.
Vk1Aj44Waa	yeah you and me both buddy|`|lywqy97Zaa	same here man|`|I8H3PZ4Jaa	my step brothers like that two your afraid of rejection. and you are actually setting yourself up for rejection talk to the ones you like talk to them get to know them and tell them about you and what you like get numbers text/call them girls think its cute when guys are shy but you need to open up more. my boyfriends shy its cute but i got him talking when i met him he gave me one word answers and then i talked and he started talking because he realized i was into him SPEAK UP BRO!!!

8XKmMBU7aa	So nice question.<br>  One girl met me, she came after running away from her house. Now she is a Punk. She is present on local Bus stand of my city. She is making sex with every one just for food. <br>  If Answer of same question had Joke, it would have really Crazy.<br>  I don't find any Joke on your beautiful question please.<br>  You may find Joke from www.google.com<br>  <br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Set down and breathe<br>    Crossing a state line is dangerous for runaways and to go to another country is asking to be killed or turned into a slave|`|claUGpVRaa	What is your age?<br>  You can't just move to Australia like that. Even if you could get there (without the flight paid for and passport and accompaniment on the plane which you would need if a child) you wouldn't be able to just stay! Australia has immigration rules you know.<br>  Your cousin would be your cousin regardless of if you lived with them or not. I think you need to sit down with your parents very urgently!|`|XadcGNGnaa	I think you should think this through very carefully. You would be across the other side of the world from your family, the people who brought you into the world. The people who cared for you and brought you up. I understand that not everyone can get on with their parents but you should try. Maybe just go out there for a month to see how you like it and see if you could do it. This would also give you a break from your family so you will come back feeling refreshed. Eventually you would begin to disagree and get annoyed with your auntie and cousins, just the same as you get annoyed with your family. Talk to your family about this, maybe you could come to an agreement about your living situation. If they adopt you then social services and maybe the police would definitely be involved in this to ensure you are absolutely safe. Your cousin would still be your cousin, they have adopted you so you would probably still class her as a cousin. Why do you feel you have to leave home, to a foster home or to Australia? Maybe this is something your family can sort out.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do some serious thinking about this, things are very different in Australia and you would be at the other side of the world from your close family. This isn't an easy decision that you can just do on the spur of a moment. It may sound good to move away from you family but you would miss them so much, you would miss the stability of having your parents and siblings with you.|`|YTXoBgVsaa	It's best you talk to an adult you trust about this. It sounds like your situation is serious, so talk to a teacher you trust, or even your aunt in australia. Also, you can go talk to your general doctor since they are under oath to not tell anyone.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you get out of this situation well!<br>  And if it is an emergency, there are always homes for teens in need, just ask your counselor at school about the nearest one to you.|`|8N7echgnaa	why cant you stay with your family? is something wrong?<br>  Have you spoken to other family members you trust fully, about your situation and the fact that you want to leave
gQyzJ76waa	Be confident, ask her out and be an Alpha Male. Stay out of the friend zone and have no regrets. If you want to learn more, I suggest you read up on some of David DeAngelo's material. Double Your Dating will change your life and is the only way you can get a girl to be 100% attracted to you.|`|NB2AQwv9aa	no body likes rejection buddy but if you dont ask you dont get|`|FOky1WqWaa	High school is all about taking chances. The best way is to take her aside and privately ask her. Personally, I always thought it was cute when a guy passed me a note in class and asked me out that way :)
XH2o1MM6aa	.I'd concentrate on meeting her outside of work.This'll be hard as these girls work awkward hours.If this tactic proves unsatisfactory,then I'd move on.
Ii5udGmJaa	You sound like you have had a pretty rough life growing up from what you been telling. It sounds like it is a mixture of depression , and not knowing who you are , hence your insecurity. That you may or may not of gained in childhood , rather it be from divorced parents or a negiligent father , or a mother even. Remember this is always meaning for life. I also pondered this question. The solution I came up with was religion , to be specific , christinaity showed me and taughted me the point of life. and why we live each and every day of our lives.  ( you may contact me , if you would like more info on that note ) <br>  Don't love yourself , rather love others , treat others as you would treat yourself. Don't mask your insecurity , in fact secure your insecurity , by speaking up in class , and if you already do that , let others speak up. Do more stuff that you have always been insecured to do. but do not go to a woman thinking that she may solve your insecurity this will not work she will leave you ,and it will end horribly , women hate the fact that some men go to them for security.<br>  as far as your sleepyness goes.I used to be in the same state. what you want to do . is wake up like 8am , go to sleep around 10 or so pm , and during the day do as many activities as you can , work out , run 5 miles ect , what ever wears you out, get into that kind of routine and I promise you , that once you start doing this you will be sleeping a lot better , <br>  when ever you start getting down , start humming good happy songs what ever cheers you up , it is not good to be depressed 24/7 , It also helps to see a therapist. I find that they tend to help out quite a bit , it may not seem like it but they really do help.<br>  <br>  well thats my 2 bits hope it helps ,|`|IAaPW50gaa	I feel the same way often. This sounds kind of mean, But you're wanting yourself to be miserable, and you're hoping to find people that feel sorry for you. After I realized nobody gave a **** about how I felt, I started meeting some people, and I could never be happier. = ).|`|w5Oedybqaa	omg! we are like exactly the same (except I'm 14, lol) Idk what you should do. I found a meaning in my life though, music for me. You'll find one.|`|hnCDmgyEaa	I am so sorry your going thru this what is wrong. your depressed. you talk as if your whole life is worthless. was there something that happen to you when you were younger. people don't feel this way unless something happen in there past that they are trying to hide from it. now some people may say your crazy but i'm not everyone feels down at times. what ever happen learn to deal with it and move on. you say you never had a close friend well i think u should give it a try, try to find some one who is outgoing and funny make friends and be happy. I'LL PRAY FOR YOU.<br>  <br>  Kepp Your Head UP. :-)|`|gGJn9G5Zaa	I feel the same way, and I have Bipolar Disorder.

I was and am in the same spot, feeling like there is no purpose to what we do; like nobody matters it’s pointless. Looking to philosophy is what I did to try and look for something that could make me “feel” inside, like there is something worth it out there. I am right there with the sleep, I have tried 6 to 12 hours of sleep and can never feel awake, I don’t know why though. I don’t know who you are but I think you might dislike your college course because it makes you feel like that is the only option; you want to do what you want but don’t know what you really want to do. I’m not sure but that’s how I felt about my college course.|`|bWd8Z4B0aa	i'm just like you almost everything but i know what life is for but anyway i'm not depressed so your probably not either i sleep because i like it and don't get enough and i laugh but am sad a lot because there are things to be sad about you can't really subconsiously be supress fealings but you say you've been like this for a while that wouldn't be considered depressed it's considered emo but that's cool if oyu really think you are i like emos even if most people don't scrue them so you really have to decide this for yourself. Do you think your depressed or just sad a lot?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I was just at a book store reading the lastest book by Dr. Michael B. Beckwith & I was looking at the last chapter which dealt with the Dark Night of the Soul. See if you can get this & read it. I also found a book I am going to look up right now to see if I can find on line for free. It is "thoughts are things" by Prentice Mulford....another good book is "You can heal your life"by Louis Hay it will give you an idea about how people come up with their ideas about what life is about. I think depression is just like a dimmer light you just choose to turn it to the dark tired end instead of the bright lively side so you can come out of this & feel better. There is nothing wrong with where you are at though. But we all want to feel good so check out the things I have suggested & also do a websearch for Abraham Hicks.|`|t3w3cDduaa	You do sound depressed.  Go talk to a psychologist.

Would you believe them if they said they were just friends?<br>  - i would believe them...<br>  <br>  Would you date someone who lived with someone of the opposite sex?<br>  - yes. i might be a little concerned at first, but after i saw the brother/sister relationship, i would be fine.<br>  <br>  If you were me, would you just stay at Mom & Dad's until you had enough money for a down payment for a permanent place, rather than wasting money on an apartment in between?<br>  - idk... that's totally up to you.|`|vrFBkvKeaa	You guys will have a wonderful time together.

IiHTk7ZHaa	He doesn't realize what he's doing, and forgetting your birthday is a pretty big thing, now he's either totally into her that she's more important than his best mate or she's too controlling and wont let him see anyone. <br>  <br>  Take some time off, ignore him, when he wants to hang out, tell him you can't, that's when it will hit him, he won't have anything to do and he'll realize what he's done, or at least he should. <br>  Find some other friends, it's not the end of the world! <br>  <br>  I've been in tons of similar situations and usually it turns out the person wasn't really my friend but I don't really want to say that now cause it didn't involve a significant other in my case so I don't want to make the wrong call. <br>  <br>  Don't stress about it too much, I've noticed when I think about those situations a lot then I go paranoid and keep thinking of all the possibilities like what if this, what if that?

djhCah5Maa	I don't know why they do this.  Usually the people that ask me don't seem smart enough to pull off some complicated scam like that.  Maybe I sound mean, but I say I don't have a phone.  I don't want some weirdo using my phone.  I wouldn't feel obligated.  They can use a payphone.

At seventeen, girls are often clique-ish and are afraid of being ostracized by their peers.  If she thinks dating you would make her friends like her less, then no, she won't date you.  <br>  <br>  The good part about this is that, in the end, you aren't dating a girl who doesn't have the ability to think for herself.  If she won't date you for that reason, consider yourself lucky!  Good luck in your romantic endeavors!|`|AA10437294	sometimes yes. some girls rely only on their friends opinions to see if the guy is good to date but if she likes you then she wont care what her friends say|`|unSpTi7raa	sometimes.if they care more about there friendz then you!|`|NLAwtUbGaa	well it depends on why she dont' like you..one of her friends may be jealous you like her friend and not her so she tells all her other friends to "hate you". it may be that the friends just don't like you.<br>  my friend didn't let me date this one guy because she didn't like him.<br>  i asked why and she said i don't want him to hurt you.<br>  (girl) friends can be very protective over their other friends. especially if its best friends your dealing with :]]<br>  if you really like this girl ask her friends why they dont like you. then if she likes you enough then she'll go out with you and her friends will get over it sometime :D hope this helps :D gooood luck|`|vNlIybfLaa	If the friend tells the girl that you like that you are weird or something, they are less likely to go out with you.|`|vmoqPUhKaa	Do you like the friends of the girl or the girl herself.  Which one is more important?  This is the question that you need to ask yourself.  If you are sweet to the girl then she will convince her friends that she likes you.  Do special things for this girl flowers, a nice card, talk to her either with her friends or without your choice.  You are not dating the friends you like the girl.  Choose and then let her know that you care.|`|PYBda7Taaa	Depends. . . If the girl has a real badass attitude and does w/e she likes and screw what anyone else says then ya she'll date whether her firends like you or not.<br>  <br>  However if she's the kinda girl who really cares what other pp say about her and cares about her friends opinion then even if she likes you she still won't date you.|`|v0era60Oaa	i feel you it depends wat type of girl iz she if she just listen 2 her friend u better stay out if not go 4 it.|`|HDnZlQDYaa	well if i liked this guy and he was nice to me, but my friends didn't like him, ide probably ask them why and everything and if they have a good enough reason like .."he pushed me down the stairs and i broke my spine and he laughed" or something horrible like that then i wouldn't go out with him.But if they don't really have a good enough reason to dislike him then ill do w/e i want, and if i really like him and my friends just dont like him for a silly reason than of course i would go out out with him b/c there not the ones dating him i would be. ya know? well thats my opinion. hope i helped =]|`|ImrJkn1waa	Ha i don't care if any of my friends don't like the person that i am seeing cause they are'nt the one i am with|`|Kaq9C2Jdaa	Yes. Unless there friends convince them that he is good for him and she shouldn't break up with him if she really likes him.|`|zinL0u00aa	No, I have a BFF who dated a guy who everyone I know (expect her) hated.|`|ChAZZpo6aa	it depends if the girl likes u and i mean if ther real freinds the other freind who dont like u sholdnt care|`|dKLEBO5Saa	Sometimes they will, sometimes they won't.  It's a choice for each individual to make.  No solid answer on this one.|`|I1vzh3lPaa	it depends on how much power her friends have over her because<br>  if she really likes you then only her BFFs opinion will matter. and if they are really her friends they would be happy no matter what. my ex best friend would always complain about the guys i like but ultimately my choice was my choice  and hers will be hers<br>        Hope that helped|`|9136WNCzaa	Depends on the girl.<br>  <br>  If she's the youngest in here family, she will do what ever her friends tell her to do. There opinion means everything to her. That is why you need to make it clear that you are in charge and that you don't give a crap about what her friends think.|`|wcVonRUuaa	It depends on how much she likes you!|`|xgiceG2iaa	yes, they would.....<br>  i would anyways..i dont care...i would date whoever i wanted...its not my friends choice or life.|`|AA12094570	Lol sometimes yeah. As a matter of fact, that happens a lot. I've seen it countless times. But that doesn't mean you have no chance. Why don't they like you? Try to prove to them that you're a good guy and stuff. Or just ask the girl out.|`|m1r1PnJfaa	no i would listen to what she says but when it comes down to it it's  me and you.|`|cdm52UGyaa	some girls wont and some could care less. its always better if their friends do like you so their not trying to constantly convince her to break up with you and all. but of course this is different for everyone.|`|zKUzxPseaa	it all depends on why her friend don't like you and if shes likes you back. i went out with a boy for a year and my bestfriend couldn't stand him the whole time =]|`|Ue1QgNAUaa	yea NO they wont date u cuz if there friend don't like the one girl u like is ganna say <br>  my friend don't like and if i date u she wont be my friend or like they will be emberessed|`|FkFwgTgmaa	Well dat depends on the type of girl she iz. So if shes a shallow chick then yea proably, if shes independent and nice then she will go out wit u weather her friend likes you or not. ^-^ Good luck<br>  <br>  ~April~|`|wCn9EwBhaa	no not all girls.but sometimes girls go with there friends opinions|`|JKAcdlZVaa	Depends on how much I like the boy. Most likley, I wouldn't date him (i'm 15) because I would lose my friends, and would feel guilty.|`|sSzG0CUlaa	no my best friend HATED one of my bfs and still went out with him.|`|fgxrdj21aa	stupid ones probly|`|rb8wwOzVaa	some of them. if she likes you, then she will|`|El7jozzraa	i think thats a stupid question. a girl will date you if she likes you. if she doesnt like you, then she won't date you.|`|VXTze2A5aa	my friends didn't like my bf. I didn't care!!!|`|8ZkvE2W9aa	ok yu need to talk to her friend first and work the sittuationout with her friend and yu!!then hook up wit d girl yu lik!!!|`|1UozHhlpaa	iT DEPENDS ON THE HiSTORY OF U AND THE FRiEND ....|`|YG68YOMWaa	Probably. Girls are very influenced by their friends at this age. It could also be her parents.|`|hLBEXVyXaa	i'm dating the one guy my friends cant stand. if she really likes you, she wont care. if she likes you but doesn't wanna date you, then she's given in to what others think and wants to still feel accepted by her friends. if this happens, talk to her about it. ask her if she really does like you, then ask if she could ask her friends to give you a shot. but respect her friends don't go off saying bad things cuz they don't like you. be nice to them as well then they'll start to like you and she'll like you even more :]]|`|GXM74MGPaa	most 17 yr old girls are shallow and follow there fellow shallow friends. so im pretty sure u will not get her to date you.|`|5lfW4v45aa	Generally no but sometimes yes.|`|06JnGkd9aa	Maybe. It depends why they don't like you. For example, if a guy asked me out and then later that day a friend told me she saw him touching himself in class or something, I would be like, "Ew. Weirdo." So it depends i guess.|`|1RjMSbipaa	depends on the girl<br>  if shes a sweet person then yes she will<br>  but if shes someone who cares about her image then she probably wont. <br>  best wishes.|`|qrHUoUVQaa	If she really likes you she will but if she thinks you are just so so then she will probably be just like her friends......i know......trust me......good luck!<br>  <br>  You could also tell her what you feel about her.
lJXxxWH7aa	leave a message or comment saying you like his page, he'll resond ------->hey i think this answer deservres "best answer!<-------|`|ow4Ec8eqaa	Wait till tommorrow when you see him again at school and smile.<br>  No Myspace.|`|pCg5JWqPaa	Wow he smiled at you score come on he's just smiled my friends smile at me every day but if you like then yes talk to him become his friend and then move in.
8JgFKfpUaa	well, girls LOVE it when guys flirt with them. Especially when they are themselves and show some humor!!!<br>  We get a weird feeling inside when they do!!!<br>  I think that she is into you because she wouldn't have asked you out if she didn't!!!<br>  Go for it!!! Well...u know what I mean!!!|`|1ac7ff377a38a39ef6014d3e31201dd7aa	Just text her, girls don't really like all the games, forget "hard to get" just do it.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	You need to keep her guessing on whether you like her, at least until you are going steady.  If you start telling her how much you like her, this will be over before it starts.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QAEm0Yitaa	Well, it really seems like she likes you, but maybe she just thinks you text her a little too much, don't play hard to get because she might start to think your not interested. just text her a smidge less and everything will work out as you want it to<br>  :)|`|wuZXqYPGaa	keep doin whut ya doin, and whut n c how the "date" or hangout turns out then u will really know if shes into you :)<br>  but remember not to be too clingy, texting alll the time.. it can be a turn off i think. shes prob into you no worries|`|6uhnyEYEaa	do not play hard 2 get, it is waay annoying. but SHOW her you are really into her and she will come to you. =)  keep texting her!|`|kPnVISdhaa	whoa... slow down i think ur a bit obsessed with this girl. Don't text her every five minutes- its annoying. also, she likes you!!!! OKAY?????? she said she'd go out with you so you should just wait until u do go out. Good Luck!:)|`|zDJQAxCbaa	well dont play hard to get because that makes it longer for you guys to hit it off. And of course she likes you and try to talk to her, look for a good conversation, but not to deep, just ask her if shes into you. Since she already likes you then thats enough for her, because if you over do it, she mite think ur obsesed hope i helped you! :-)|`|qxxK7w0taa	Juss take  it easy. Don't rush things. It You text tor  talk  to  her too much  she  might  feel  like your invading here space. Get to know things she likes and be romantic. The next time You go out get  a single rose and give  it to her. Keep her on her toes. Give her compliments on how she looks. Just don't over do it. =)<br>  Good luck.|`|zKUzxPseaa	okay im a girl and i cannot stand! when guys try to hard, and talk to much. lol sorry but play it cool if your going out with her just wait till then, and text her the night before. and when you meet her make her laugh and look cute it will get her thinking. most of all be your self|`|GAfJu156aa	Play it off cool. Don't text her as much. She'll start to find you more attracktive. (Known fact) When she text's you the next time, take awhile to reply. Then she'll warm up to you. Do the same. Game's are lame anymore!|`|Qv57dITWaa	Flirt with her a bit more when you see her.

0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Yes her reaction is completely normal...  her hormones are all over the place for Christ sake!!!!!  Give her a break, let her hormones settle, and she'll come around and realize you didn't mean anything by it other than to be funny.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I cant see what the problem is.  Most babies are ugly.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Yes and surly you can get passed this there is more then this to come in the marriage.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	I'm with you on most babies being awkward looking little things when they're first born... luckily most of them grow out of it.  <br>  <br>  Your wife is all over the place with her hormones, which may account for her overreaction - I think a lot of new parents want people to coo over their spawn and say how gorgeous and precious he/she is.<br>  <br>  I think the way to approach this is to point out to your wife that while you did say your offspring looked like a mutant, you didn't say that you didn't or wouldn't love him/her.  <br>  <br>  As for kids that claim to be hurt by their parents/family members making fun of them when they were babies... get a life.  Giving a child pet names like 'Taz', 'Monkey' etc are not forms of abuse.  Mental and physical torture... fair enough, but pet names???  <br>  <br>  Hopefully the hormones will stop swirling soon and she's going to be able to think rationally about the situation.  For now let her ignore you and spend some time with your new sprog.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	fail!<br>  <br>  . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-'". . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Not all babies are soooo cute like everyone says. About time someone said the truth.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Nice going bozo. What are you going to do for an encore?|`|Yleae8hiaa	I would say it was ridiculous. Most babies when the born are not cute. Heads could be misshapen and they are red. I've never seen a cute baby when they are born, not even my nephews. But I don't know that I would have said that to her. But if she wants a divorce because of it, well that just stupid. Good luck|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Most newborn babies are a little ugly, it's true, but everyone is too polite to say it. She's probably still hormonal so just apologize and I'm sure she'll get over it.|`|NGKwsawdaa	What's more ridiculous is your lack of respect for your wife and your new born. How on earth can you say your baby looks like a mutant, well maybe he/she got the looks from you.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	l'm surprised your're still breathing mate! Beg, crawl on all fours apologising but there's some words you can't take back. lf you love them you won't let it happen|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Ummmm... Remember the saying about a face "Only a Mother could Love"?.   (This is supposed to apply to fathers also.) Think before you speak.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I hope you were joking and she took it the wrong way...they all look like "little mutants" until the nurses clean them up...|`|kej0H1AXaa	it's her fault its ugly|`|bqkfu6Diaa	She just had a baby, and her emotions are running wild because of the life change mixed with hormonal fluctuations. She will take trivial things personally from time to time. Just love her and support her and assure her that you love the ugly little mutant child (but use softer sounding words if possible).|`|tlxG2q04aa	It depends on whether it was true or not.  If it wasn't, then that was pretty mean but she's still overreacting.  If it is true (and, let's face it, it probably is) then it was a fair comment and she is being ridiculous.<br>  <br>  My parents said I looked like Taz, the Warner Brothers' Tasmanian Devil, when I was born.  It still hurts.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Sounds like drama, honestly.<br>  <br>  Oh, and btw, nice mohawk, do you have one irl? lol, had to ask, my entire office nearly went into shock when I appearred with a black and blue mohawk one day.<br>  <br>  As for your question, I would suggest backing off the mutant comments for a while, lol; but if she's REALLY trying to leave you, it's probably not solely because of that, it's because of other issues that have gone unresolved or unadressed for a while, this may be her 'free ticket' to get out. Who knows.<br>  <br>  Talk to her, apologize, because in reality, you should've been more understanding of her feelings, and go from there.<br>  <br>  And as a guy who loves to joke around like that, trust me, you'll want to back off on that for a while.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|CugCzH9iaa	OH!!!  That is kinda mean, but my husband said the same type thing 6 months ago when we had our baby.  Newborns face's are so squished when they come out, he was just making a joke about it.  Women though are very sensitive to what the husband/father thinks about the baby and them and their post baby body.  Because of  all she just went through over the last 9 months she will be sensitive for a while. Just reassure her and give her a few days to get over it. Good Luck!!!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	that seems a little extreme. Maybe she's over reacting just a little bit there. I'm guessing you were joking around when you said the baby looked like a mutant. Newborn babies all look weird. If she is that ready to drop you over one little thing, seems to me like there are more issues than just that.|`|65RZ441Zaa	My husband and I laugh at how ugly our first son was! he looked like a purple Barbut fish. His lips were huge and puprle, his face was all squished together, he had patches of yellow curly hair lol... he was crammed in there for 9mth and 10 days !! haha maybe she's still sensitive, but this should NOT end your marriage lol that would be ridiculous on her part!!! she'll get over it|`|hXNuyTKaaa	I think its pretty funny. I mean i think at a time like giving birth something a little funny to break the ice like that would be helpful. Just give her a benefit of the doubt and say you are sorry. She is a little hormonal at the moment. But i totally agree with you. Newborns sometimes look a little messed up.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	After a woman has a child she is dealing with a huge shift in her hormones. It was very insensitive of you to say that about your child. There are just certain things that you should not verbalize.|`|W2RaqfWOaa	Just wait till that kids 15 and she tells it you said it looked like a mutant.  This will look a lot less ridiculous compared to that situation|`|djUMvICoaa	She may be right.  There seems to be a sadistic streak in you.  She can live without that.|`|fl2quGcCaa	it IS your fault the baby is ugly|`|YtDp0wjdaa	LMAO!!! nice job man u know shes all hormonal.  thats funny.  at least ur honest =]
YHQgtP3paa	Dont remind her about it. If she brings it up, just say its common for nylons to stink after half a day at work. Lol. (:|`|SimAO1IUaa	i think bringing it up would make it more awkward, i would just not mention it and just act like nothing happened, and start some kind of conversation like it was no big deal, because it really wasnt! <br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226143429AANe83j&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Don't bring it up.
utAXbe4eaa	Yeah she is definately jealous<br>  You should be happy about that.<br>  mann she is sooo jealous lol|`|iNgfizSgaa	Yep, definitely jealous. Go get her!|`|MlhMXIrNaa	i think she likes u.. :P:L|`|xJBJn6dOaa	probably just jealous...|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Jelus , Paranoid
Jly7xMU6aa	OK here's one way to avoid drama. Don't mention any names and say to her "I've heard that you've been talking about me but I'm gonna put an end to all this. keep my name out my mouth or else i wont be responsible for my action." Look he r up and once and slowly walk away.
5jMNBO2naa	you have total control of who you fall in love with<br>  as love is not a passive activity<br>  you got lust on the brain<br>  as how well do you know him?<br>  attraction is one thing ( lust )<br>  but love is far deeper than that<br>  and thus love is grown as you know some person and see who they really are<br>  that's why fools rush into relationships<br>  thinking they have found love<br>  only later to realize they were in lust / infatuation with the person|`|c0VZhGh9aa	It's more likely lust. It's temporary and if you acted upon it you would wind up regretting your actions and destorying your marriage. Stay away from him if you're married of have a partner. You said you don't work that closely with him so it shouldn't be too hard.<br>  <br>  Flirt with him if you must, and only if you must. But control it and don't take it any further. Make sure that's clear to him too.|`|JaFVPFaFaa	Hi Aamina,<br>  <br>  That is the thing you don't choose who you love and it can be a straight up pain in the bum.<br>  <br>  You could try the following write down all the things that annoy you about him and every time you think about him read them.<br>  <br>  But in all honesty your in love --- done!!!|`|ehAG30Yvaa	So you like a guy at work...what's so bad about that? If the feelings are mutual than go for it. Obviously you can't be to lovey dovey while you're working but what you do outside of working hours is completely up to you. Especially if you don't work closely with him then I'm not sure why this is a hard situation for you. If you like him and he likes you then spend some time together and see where it goes. The only downside is if things don't work out it will be awkward to see each other at work after the fact. But love isn't easy and it's definitely worth the risk if he turns out to be the love of your life. Life is too short not to spend more time with someone you think is special. And I really beleive that you can't control who you fall in love with. If you feel it you just feel and it there's nothing you can do about it. Good luck!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You can control it if you believe you can. It's not like you were born with a predisposition to love this particular person; over the course of your lifetime, you will meet many people who will attract your attention, and some of them will seem very compelling to you. But when the circumstances do not allow for the development of a relationship, it's in your hands to re-channel your attention elsewhere. Accept your crushes as a normal part of your reality, but don't let them grow into an obsession.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Is he married or is there another reason that you can't date him?  I don't think it is possible to choose who we love, we can however choose not to ruin someone elses life.  Good luck.
JzK59nt1aa	I would just try talking to her again, and if the conversation goes as well as the first time id try asking her out. Where do you know her from?
cCwO36Ubaa	your best friend. if your girl friend cant trust you to have friends that are girls, then she isnt worth it.|`|iN1IKCeYaa	friends are for life no mater what even if they are girls they will still be your friend! but that is up to you <br>  <br>  <br>  but i say the friend just my opinion good luck|`|EbUSYjLRaa	best friend blood is thicker than girlfriends

What a stupid question. You must be 15-17 years old. When you mature and see what brings up intimacy and passion, you will see how a women does everything you think that right now they won't. Last but not least, you call her your girl. It sounds like to me this is your first one and you've been together about two weeks.|`|fFnfFROQaa	Maybe the act of ejaculation from the organ looks similar to pissing urine in the toilet???<br>  Maybe that thought is what is going through the head.|`|dalNxu8zaa	cuz its nasty and it just does not taste good|`|joA5Rcyzaa	would you want to swallow it?<br>  <br>  if i was a girl i wouldn't be too pumped to do so|`|usj1lyfFaa	Most do, but some don't.  I'm sure younger or more inexperienced girls are just more hesitant.  Ask her "How would you feel if I went down on you and turned my head to spit every minute or so?"  <br>  <br>  Also tell her that she shouldn't eat the cake without the frosting.|`|1e66262e2ef399091d3ff08f8c8d60c0aa	funny you ask ?  not all women will swallow,just make sure that if thats one of the things you want in a relationship don't settle for anything less,odds are if she don't swallow now ,she won't ever swallow....|`|lIYKAvvRaa	It's kind of disgusting to swallow it, that's why. It's like swallowing pee or something. Would you swallow her ***?|`|AA11795191	Cause its gross to them? I mean, there are girls that do....but some wont.

There are women out there that will swallow.  You just have to break-away from the type of women that you are going after.|`|hsHOzGx3aa	Some women don't mind at all and some do... it's just a matter of what a person likes or doesn't like. Alot of men simply cannot handle giving a woman oral sex either.|`|Pk0jCXjyaa	The taste and the texture. <br>  <br>  I mean, just think about it.<br>  <br>  Thousands of little creatures swimming in a...yea. You get the picure.
0ClA7HlEaa	It means that they care about you and was just thinking about you that you're okay. the friend you're talking about thinks of you as her/his best friend.|`|az0Z0DIjaa	HUH? If a friend said "I was just checking up on you" it would usually just seem like a sweet, simple thing to say. Kinda like "what's up?" or "what's new in your world?" or "how are you these days?" Generally, it would just be, "well....just wanna check in with ya. I miss ya. Was thinking bout ya." That simple. It doesn't really imply anything...|`|gC8xO53Oaa	They just want to see if everything is ok with you. It's out of concern and respect and to show they care about you.|`|m8QfHC7uaa	It sounds a little bit strange and can mean different things, just ask....you have nothing to loose, but info to gain.|`|rM6i2LvTaa	It could mean exactly what was said and that's it, or something more.  Maybe they think you're wondering why they're there.  Maybe they think you don't have a lot of people close to you and you need someone checking on you.  Maybe they thought you were in trouble and wanted to make sure you're okay.  Or maybe they really wanted an excuse to say hi, felt uncomfortable just showing up, and don't want you to think they're weird.  Maybe you borrowed their shovel last week and forgot to return it, and are hoping their presence will trigger your memory so they don't have to actually ask for it back.  Which means they're saying empty phrases to kill time until you remember again.  Not returning borrowed items can be a real friendship killer.<br>  <br>  More information is needed to really know.  But it probably means they care about you.|`|c55O7jqXaa	This is just a saying and doesn't mean anythign other than they just called to talk and see how you are doing. Most people don't read into it. It is like trying to read someone's mind.|`|jIsAIwCgaa	you didnt give much detail about the sittuation or conversation, but it sounds like they were "just checking up on you" and also sounds like your overanalyzing so maybe YOU want it to go somewhere and should explore that...|`|2U2dqAa3aa	You don't get out much do you?<br>  <br>  Don't read too much into it.<br>  Go with the flow.<br>  <br>  Take a walk at the park.<br>  <br>  J|`|lqt3wTQvaa	that your friend cares about you and wants to make sure you are doing well|`|vA07XhcKaa	I think your reading too much into. Has the person not heard from you in a while? Perhaps you were just on their mind and since they care about you as a friend, were making sure everything was ok in your life. I do that quite often with friends I have lost touch with or who have become too busy to have time for me. It is just a form of reassurance to let them know I am here if they need anything and for me to know they are ok. Some people are too shy to ask for help but will say " well now that you ask, I have been kinda down". <br>  Unless it becomes obsessive, I would just say they care about you as a friend.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	It means they  were wondering how your doing
0q5Z5zxIaa	if you both love each other and the relationship is meant to be, then you will get through this. as soon as the argument is sorted out properly between you two then things will probably get back to normal and you wont feel that temporary "hate" for her anymore. it's normal for people to feel like they hate the person they are in an argument with.<br>  <br>  i suggest that you just sit down and talk to her about it, and try to understand why she reacted the way she did in the argument. it does sound like she's sorry for what she said. but if you still feel this kind of dislike for her in a few weeks/months time or so, then you could think about maybe ending the relationship.. is there any point in being in a relationship with someone who makes you angry and want to smash everything around you? ...<br>  <br>  only you will know the right decision to make. follow your heart.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|bc7f3e18f5c0ec0964528f9f8771a134aa	Talk to her, it sounds like she feels very guilty and didn't mean what she said. All of us say things out of anger. You need to meet up and talk about this and ask her why she did this.
2FsNdcXEaa	Honestly, I think a lot of black women tend to be really really pretty. They've got amazing lips and hair and skin :]|`|mCoipTkbaa	because there are alot of racist people on Y!A...the same as if you were to go on youtube...as soon as you look at a video of a black female singer you will see alot of racial slurs in the comments like ******. as for on the white girls video you will see positive comments. idk  that's just how it is.....<br>  <br>  but i get told i am beautiful in the real world all the time,,,what people say on the internet doesn't get to me!!!!|`|SimAO1IUaa	i disagree, i think black girls can look very pretty! i think people say that kind of thing because its a stupid stereotype that a "black girl is ghetto" or "asians are always smart" that kind of thing and any race can be "ghetto" or whatever. people like that are only ignorant! <br>  please answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226143429AANe83j&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|RhZaVwKkaa	No. I go to a mostly black school and almost everyone prefers the black girls over the white ones.<br>  <br>  Except my boyfriend.

74gPuaXMaa	Like what's wrong? Stabbing each others throats with your tongues? Hitting teeth all the time? Just got learn how to control your bodies more. Less tongue, just lightly stick it out. And moving aggressively makes things a lot harder. Just be gentle, until you guys get better.|`|xNpVCEn2aa	Take control.  Sit him down when you two are alone, and tell him to close his eyes and only follow you.  Then you kiss him the way you want to be kissed, and stop if he tries to kiss you his normal way again.  Hopefully he'll start to calm down a bit.  But it is still a case of getting used to each other like you said.  Give it a little time, it's only been two days.  I'm sure it will get better =)|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Just talk to him about it. Instead of criticizing him you can say something like "I love it when you barely push into me when we kiss" or something like that. It makes it so that he doesn't think you're being mean and you still get what you want. Things will get easier the longer you go out. Give it some time for you guys to get used to each others style. Eventually you'll be able to tell him exactly what you like

HHO3cGLKaa	Well, I would say... Admit that you made a mistake for getting mad, and say sorry. If you don't, I can guarantee that it will hinder your relationship with you friend, and if you don't, it will probably be on the back of your mind, bugging you(which is not a good thing). It's always better to say sorry in the end; it feels better when you do it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|V2qyE68Jaa	OMFG THAT SOUDS JSUT LIKE ME AND MY FRIEND WHEN SHE ACTS LIKE AN *** ONFG omgogmgomggomg this really sounds like something we would do and that REALLY sounds like something she would say OMFG|`|cggkcAC5aa	Do what you feel you should do.|`|Dfzs9TThaa	umm...you can start by calling her instead of texting and say sorry...say you were so mad about the situation at the time. Then tell her you didn't mean to say all that about her and that you regret it. <br>  If i were her I would let it go if you tell me that and apologize because your being honest and i would hear the sincere in your voice<br>  <br>  good luck|`|03GQ637Raa	I'm confused.  I would leave it alone and see where it goes.  If it will make you feel better to apologize, then do it.  It sounds a little immature.  Be cool for a minute some things have there own way of working out.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Has your friend mentioned his mom's bad behavior?  Is he aware that she was misbehaving?  If he is aware of her rudeness, you don't have to say anything at all.  You cannot control someone else's mom.  If he isn't aware, you might want to talk to him (away from her) just so he knows why you never will do anything with her ever again.  Invite him along with you but make sure she is not coming.  They don't bring bad children along on outings, bullying adult chaperones too can be left home where they won't cause your outing any bad feelings.  Let him know so he understands why his mom will not be invited to some and if she does come, you (all) will not go.  He has to live with his mom so you don't want to cause any more distress then he already has, and you like him so he can come along.  Just have as little as possible to do with her, and when you have to deal with her just bite your tongue and show her what a child raised with good manners is like, even when being insulted.  And leave as quickly as possible.|`|oojO4WAraa	How old is your friend?  <br>  <br>  I would stay friends with the guy, but avoid going to his house or anywhere you have to see his mother.  And if you plan any more trips - don't include her in the plans.  That is very sad for him.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Ask her if she wants you to fix her up with a guy to fu^k her brains out.She apparently needs something to relieve the stress of trying to be a human being.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Listen....I don't know what you mean by making a scene or treating him mean....but let me help you understand a couple things!<br>  <br>  Some people like Forrest Gump may have some behavior problems you are not aware of and they have to be handled in a certain way.  When they are small it is easy to handle them...but when they are bigger it takes more.  YOU CANNOT allow any adult...if they are like Forrest Gump to get out of control.  NOT SAYING THIS IS THE PROBLEM....but I know people in that position that seem to be the biggest ***** in the world and yet they are doing that person a favor.<br>  <br>  You do not know the history of this person and what is needed.<br>  <br>  Let me give you an example of my own son.  He is a paraplegic.  When he came out of his coma he had one arm he could use ...and he had to do physical therapy.  He had to wheel his chair and get back as much strength and use in his body as quickly as he could.<br>  <br>  I would take him to the mall and tell him I was walking but I would be close by.  I had to leave him...make him do what he needed to do.  I never left his sight...but he would sit there and cry and call for me.  (He was 7).  I would go back and tell him...Kevin Wheell this chair...and he didnt' want to do it.  He was angry and confused ...but he had to start living in a real world and pity was not going to make it.<br>  <br>  You would be suprised how many people thought I was the most abusive and bitchy person in the world.  You have no idea how many nights I would cry myself to sleep and pray for courage to be strong enough to withstand others criticism of me.  I KNEW what my son had to accomplish...and being 7 and cute  and helpless...was not going to get to manhood and have a productive life.<br>  <br>  In the hopsital there was a young man...22..with the mind of a 7 year old .  He was 6 ft 7 inches...and his mother was all of 5 ft 4 inches...she HAD TO BE MEAN or SEEM to be mean to make him behave....or he would have to be in a home.  SHe loved her son...but she knew she had to keep a tight leash on him so he didn't hurt anyone !  Not that he was dangerous...but you can't feel sorry for them....they  have to live in a world that people judge them when they are adults and not cute children anymore.<br>  <br>  I don't know the whole situation......but there is another side.  IF YOU FEEL she is abusive...why not get to know her more.  Go talk to her and find out what life is like with him and how he grew up and know the history.  She might be just showing a lot of stress of no one understanding HER position and it isnt' up to her to spend hours explaining it to anyone.<br>  <br>  Maybe someone said something to her that upset her and you didn't hear it.<br>  <br>  Listen honey...having a handicapped child is difficult  People have no idea what it takes to raise one and what you have to sacrifice in your lifetime to keep them safe and make them as responsible and  grown up as they can be.  It is not easy...and people talk about you and judge you unfairly all the time.  <br>  <br>  I would take another look at this situation....and talk to the mother and get to know her and about their lives.  Maybe she can use some help and friends for her child but you have to UNDERSTAND the situation before you can do that.  You can't do that by judging her without knowing everything.<br>  <br>  Granted some parents abuse their children....if you think this is the case then call the cops and explain.  But first get to know this mother and her problems .  People like Forrest Gump can be VERY STUBBORN at times...sweet as they are...they can be very problematic....and  mothers know when and how to nip that in the bud IMMEDIATELY.  <br>  <br>  she isn't being abusive there...but responsible and handling a situation that she has lived with all her life!|`|m8QfHC7uaa	I have a handicap adult (21yrs old) she is my daughter. I love her to death. I have put people in their place when they treat her differently.  <br>  It's very draining, stressful, and tiring to be the main caregiver of a handicap person.  <br>  Perhaps she needs another "adult" person with knowledge about handicap children to talk to.  She's sounds very stressed out and in need of a break. Sounds like she has no one at all to talk to, see if you can help her find that someone in the community, but she has to be willing. <br>  Good luck!|`|SVsFJl08aa	say" people are always asking kids to have respect to adults and we expect u to treat us nicely back, with respect!! there is no reason to make someone feel uncomfterable or to start a scene"..thats what i would say|`|98tnx1Uhaa	It sounds like that is just the way she is, plan to do things without her. I really think talking to her would make it worse|`|QxtdyNvgaa	explain to your friend<br>  do not involve with her mother and if you tell ur mate she will probably tell ehr mum to cut it out!|`|lnRMmSeyaa	talk to her attitude to her and if she doesnt change you prob wont be able to hang with him anymore, or dont invite her!|`|UPhJNCRZaa	i had the same prob.<br>  just act your age and say your manners,<br>  and one day you will be her fav|`|pRxzPiSbaa	punch her in the throat. that'll earn some respect.|`|0zDiiEStaa	kill her............. with kindness|`|bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	punch her in the face!!|`|2U2dqAa3aa	That mom's a douche.  Ignore her and do whatever you like with the son, within reason.<br>  <br>  J|`|VJNLkJT0aa	It's pointless to revisit what happened on your trip now. The mom sounds just as isolated and very used to having her way. Certainly see your friend again and avoid inviting mom if you can. Should you have to enjoy her company again- if a situation gets carried away; politely inform her that is not how you treat/handle things in your life and that you do appreciate her showing some constraint and respect. Let as much of it go as you can by accepting that this is her way and what your friend is used to. Take each situation as it happens and decide if it is worth a fuss or not. Her bark is probably much worse than her bite. Some folks are just that way.  Keep your distance when you can since it's her son's, not her company you want.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	It probably wouldn't do you any good to talk to her anyway.  If she has this type of personality then there is nothing that you can do about it.  In the future, why not just ask the friend and exclude the mother.  If she doesn't let him go without her, then ask if she can suggest another escort for him.  Just say something like "If you don't want to let him go alone, can you suggest someone that can accompany him". If you are concerned about the treatment of your friend, then you need to talk to him about it.  If it seems that his mother is abusing him then call the authorities.<br>  Red

h09gCzJgaa	i think u've answered ur own question in a way - if he did love you he would be willing to stop doing what he does that makes you uncomfortable.  You will go through a lot more of these happy and sad times until you find that man that's right for you and I say this because unless the man is ready to commit, they will not give up what they like.  Take this as a lesson, don't love someone with all your heart until you know they love you just as much.  There's no way to "get over it" easily but to start hanging out with friends and meet new people to keep urself occupied. good luck.|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	Hun just take it easy.

uBssj3Znaa	doesn't sound like your boyfriend is a very good boyfriend and that your best friend isn't a very good best friend. I wouldn't have forgave either of them, and I definitely would break up with my boyfriend and stop talking to my friend. <br>  If they did it once right in front of you, what makes you think it won't happen again, maybe this time when you aren't around.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	How do you know he would never do it again? Did you think he would do it in the first place?|`|eYmIlVnGaa	dump your boyfriend, he hardly deserves to be your friend. move on, your very young and there will be so many more better people in your life. If you still want to be with him you should at least talk to your friend about this to. its very strange that they did this in front of you, it sounds planned to me and if I were you Id talk to them about it honestly to get the truth of the event instead of just excuses like he will never do it again.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Yes he will do it again.

And it's possible that he was only using you in the first place. <br>  I say dump him and find someone worthy.

Good luck.<br>  <br>  Play for a while(15 min) to produce natural lubrication. If not, buy some lubricant. You say it hurts, but this is only for about 15 seconds. It is then that the motion of the male's penis spreads your natural lubrication along with his pre semen lubrication. After 15-30 seconds, you're in heaven. Do not be scared. It is excellent for both of you when you the female shows aggression and improves the feeling.

The first time is going to hurt because your muscles aren't used to the invasion. use plenty of lubricant, and make him go slow. The only way it's going to stop hurting is if you practice a couple of times. I'm sorry it's just nature.|`|il6nxriYaa	Have your boyfriend finger you alot, like keep adding a finger every now and then and get it loose so the penis can get inserted easier, and yes, use lube! =]|`|NFawpVhRaa	its usually hurts first two and three times.<br>  position is very important. right and good position ll be minimum hurt and easily go|`|DAlakuWuaa	This is a weird question to put on here...

qAHAb5RRaa	I am so truly happy for you. I'm in an awesome(ish) relationship now but not for quite as long and it doesn't seem as meaningful. A relationship like yours is rare and special. You shold cherish every moment it lasts but I would neve bind myself to it at such a young, uneasy age. <br>  As I am sure you know as a teen, which both you and your boyfriend are, you are changing so often. All of this is a step to make you the stronger, best version, of yourself when you grow older. Both of you will change. It is inevitable and not something to be afraid of. It's something to look forward to. You are unstable in who you are right now, so why try and find that special someone to complete you, when you dont even know who you are.<br>  The decisions you make have a snowball effect. Good and bad ones will be with you forever, keeping you in check, and making you wiser. This is just another lesson.<br>  Good for you that you and your boyfriend seem, and for all I know may be, meant for each other. But as hard as it is to admit, you most likely aren't. There will be many other guys to sweep you off your feet. <br>  Stay with him. Believe you are going to last forever. When/if you don't... be sad! Act like the world has come crashing down! It very well may have!<br>  Then come to your senses and see, maybe he wasn't Mr. Right,but he was Mr. Right for me then. Just not anymore. And that is okay. Fun while it lasted for sure. Just don't make any big, unredoable mistakes.<br>  <br>  *you never know, Cory and Tapanga (Boy meets world) did it! But they were much older when they tied the knot. ...Oh...and thats a show...*|`|kkM8vFfKaa	I'm 18 and I've been dating my boyfriend now for two years a some months. I've realized that I love him, and he loves me, and we've, too, talked about marriage and our future together. I really do hope I marry him, as he was the one who took my virginity and I took his. He told me he wants to marry me, too, he's just not ready yet. And I respect that because I'm not ready yet, either. You need to really think about this. You have only been dating 11 months. If you think about it it's not that long compared to other couples. 2 years isn't even that long.<br>  Being together should be enough for you right now. You're only 15, and probably in what, 10th grade? You've still got your whole high school career and college ahead of you. Be a kid first before you jump into adult situations. If he sticks around long enough, 2- 3 years, then maybe get a little more serious about your relationship. There's no need to jump into an engagement.<br>  For as long as my boyfriend and I have been together, I've realized that there's no rush. We love eachother, and whatever happens is meant to be. If you two really are soulmates, then what's the problem with wating? It would only be better because then you could finish school, and finish be a kind, as well as your boyfriend. <br>  Answering your question... yes, it could last forever. But jumping into engagement and marriage could probably hurt your relationship if not ruin it if it's done too soon. Just take it slow, trust me. I've felt the exact same way as you have with my boyfriend, but I realized that about after a year and a half that neither of us were ready to be married. We were still kids! We were still in school, and there was no rush in getting married after a year of dating.<br>  I really hope this helps and opens your eyes. Good luck to you and your boyfriend  :)|`|xHqqZEXNaa	HAAA i highly advise against it, but its your life, i mean, he could be the one, but i dont know anyone at 17 who wants to be engaged, nevermind anyone who should be engaged at 17, make sure he wants to be engaged to you as well. I say dont do it, but then again thats not the answer you wanted to hear|`|w5Oedybqaa	No, you can't stay the way you are forever. That doesn't mean you can't always love each other and get engaged and married and etc. but the initial love you feel for someone can only last for four years. It's different after that.|`|kyutVH1Caa	definetly... u r mant to b together...|`|Pd0L0Jqdaa	I woulds say no. Don't.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Actually I do have a question and that is if you two plan on going to college and if so, the same one? I do think that the age is a little young and you are only 15 at this point and when or if he goes to college, it might be hard to maintain that relationship. I do believe that you two really love each other and are committed but to plan an engagement seems a little too soon. I wouldn't want to rush this. I think it would be best to take your time and see how things work out with either him or you going off to college. Don't get me wrong because these kinds of relationships work out as long as the commitment is there. I really do think that you should consider a promise ring until you are a little older. You still haven't even finished high school yet. Do you plan on being married right after high school?|`|GyumiWtbaa	Hey I am "Why Hello There's" boyfriend and I wanted to add something she left out. Getting married only adds a title to the relationship. It may feel different but you wont know if you guys are 'ment' for eachother until you live together. It may seem fine right now but when you guys are together forever, in the same house all the time, no space away from eachother, it becomes stressful. You need to really think about what you really want. just remember what I said. Marriage is just a title. The love for eachother is what really counts.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Of course it can be something that lasts a long time, if you stay strong and put the effort into making it last.  However, most people think they will last and sometimes they don't, especially at your age.  Both of you will be changing a lot throughout the next few years, and if you can make it until after high school, you can consider this more. There are a handful of relationships that do last and for a lifetime.  An engagement as young teenagers is a bad idea.  My advice to you is, wait until you both graduate high school and whatever is beyond that, until the time is perfectly right.  If you both feel the same, then by all means, do it!  I know it seems like it's a long time to wait, but if you truly love each other, what's the rush?  You have forever to do this.  Also, would your parents, family and friends be proud of you two getting engaged at such a young age?  Most wouldn't.  It's okay to dream about the big day when it may happen, but you have many other things to worry about at your age.  A promise ring might not seem good enough, but maybe just talking about the future will ease things up a bit.  So...quick recap, wait until you're older and ready to handle something like this before you set anything in stone.<br>  Best wishes!
7QtY1cSmaa	Yes. You can do MUCH better.<br>  <br>  From what you have said about the way he treats you and his photograph, I can't see how a gorgeous looking girl like you ended up with such a soft looking twit who doesn't have the sense to realise that he was batting WAY out of his league.<br>  <br>  Don't bother to speak to him, he will just continue to undermine your self confidence to bring you down to his level. It won't be long before he realises that he has made a big mistake and try to worm his way back into your life. Don't be fooled, he'll dump you again as soon as he thinks he can do better because he has that sort of personality. He will always be looking for a trophy girl to boost his already over-inflated ego.<br>  <br>  You are not shallow, you just need someone to treat you like the lovely girl you are and allow you to get your confidence back.|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	ithink u r 100% compatible|`|AA12094570	Omg girl, you need to seriously move on. Obviously he wasn't good for you. I don't care how you look, (or how you think you look), no one deserves to be treated like that (unless they're an *** themselves). You can do way better than that. Listen to your friends. He looks like a douche bag just by his picture, and by your description, he sounds like one too. Like I said, listen to your friends, and find a guy that loves and appreciates you, and treats you the way you should be treated. Good luck.|`|ufdFei1jaa	Looks do not matter, neither of these people are ugly in looks, but if he called you these names then surely he is ugly inside.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	He looks like a total d-bag, drop him like a bad habit.|`|Oif6WjA6aa	aaaaaaaaahahaah he looks like a peado.... stay away|`|knklZEyMaa	You shouldn't be picking the people you date by the way they look. That's what we call shallow! Find someone you really connect with. Not just because he's nice to look at.
POHWTDPRaa	You wouldn't have to ask if it was love.
vbtCjgSjaa	this has sooo happened to me before! and the guy that liked me was so totally....EW! so anyways, smile and be nice like any other person who u would treat aaandd....dont tell him u like him back but be honest and tactful....say smehting like...oh thank you...and maybe make up some excuse to walk awawy or get some friends to tell that person tha t u dont like him the way back that he likes you! its much better wen done thru friends! =]<br>  ?good luck!|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	Just be kind and honest with him. You don't want to become trapped in a relationship that isn't real. You'd both be hurt if you aren't straight up, honest with the guy. But be encouraging that there are plenty of other fish in the sea for him! :)  And don't forget to SMILE. Good luck!|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	You should not pretend, tell him the honest truth.
OHcUkfNDaa	i think she is kinda interested again or she would have never started talkn to u again i think it's worth a shot! :)|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yes! Go for it! But don't do her that way again cuz if you do you'll loose her for good. Fight for what you want!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|P3OWfxi5aa	well i wouldnt go after ur ex's best friend again. but maybe you should try to get back with ur ex. start hanging out more. just dont rush anything yet. good luck :]] hope i helped|`|dlGZebDmaa	Sounds like you dont know what you want. Just be friends first then see how you feel. <br>  Asking the best friend was a bad idea, I dont think i would have appreciate it...maybe your ex wants to make sure you still have feelings for her and thats about it.|`|ibkZcuRDaa	u should try <br>  but if the friend told her that u asked her oit ur ex might not like that and think ur only tryina get at her cuz she said no|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	Tell her how you really feel....<br>  if it really is worth it.
uO3RwRjUaa	Corny? Ignore the person that said that..  That's really sweet.  How close are you to this guy?  Friends?  In my opinion.. without knowing the whole situation of course... he likes ya.  I think you chould definitely pursue this in any way possible.  Get his opinion of you.  Start txting him. Good luckkkk!<br>  <br>  -lillY|`|bbLkL3JNaa	LOL how cute!!! I'm not sure though, that's tough.|`|VIUvhtOgaa	no he doesn't like you|`|OlXhEVNEaa	lol i dunno....try it...|`|bkRVHAgWaa	haha, thats adoreable :)<br>  i think thats a sign he likes ou but you should talk to him about your feelings and see if he feels the same way never know unless you try !|`|iOeMvaWqaa	Awwww that's so cute!|`|XO8rWEbnaa	LOL. You're joking, right?|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	how old are you?|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Lol, that's corny.
EJWphb88aa	explore all the fishes possible... and finally opt for the best...!
mCpC4Zjbaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I know how stressful a first kiss can be! I held off until the summer right before grade nine. I had tons of boyfriends before then, and somehow avoided kissing them. I even fainted into a locker once lol<br>  <br>  I'm guessing if you haven't made out with someone before you are quite young, and the guy you like is probably pretty young too. I'm sure he isn't an expert at kissing yet either so don't worry! <br>  <br>  Here are some websites to give you some help, and a little confidence boost. But trust me it really isn't that big of a deal!! You will be fine =)  Also, if he has gone out with you before and he is now going out with you again he must really like you and I don't think that he would judge you on something as silly as not having kissed a guy before. It just means you aren't a hussy.. he might even think it's cute =)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howtokiss.info/first_kiss2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtokiss.info/first_kiss2.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/blogs/showblog.php?post=712" rel="nofollow">http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/blogs/showb...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.romanceclass.com/miscr/LoveSCat/113" rel="nofollow">http://www.romanceclass.com/miscr/LoveSC...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck! Oh and the best tip I can give is to have fresh breath =)
W3GNMDbNaa	just leave things alone and make sure you dont tell ANYONE that you told not even your best friend because she or he might tell.<br>  <br>  i used to get picked on all the time. but now im in highschool and im popular now kinda. lol Just still cool. and tell the girl to leave you alone. and like dont be scared.|`|BJERgbM5aa	You're going to lose a friend.  But that's ok, because you weren't a good friend to her and she wasn't a good friend to you, so nothing really lost.  Except, she might want to give you a beating.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	So you made it look like a third girl was involved and told on the other two girls?<br>  Shame on you!<br>  Own up to it!  What kind of friend are you?  A liar?<br>  Glad you are not my friend!  <br>  If you keep doing things like this in life, you will end up with no friends!<br>  If I was either of these girls, I would not want to be your friend!<br>  Would you like to be your dishonest friend?|`|fb5d7O6Saa	You need to confront your friend about her behavior. If it is unpleasant, then address it. Then let her know that you told a teacher. She may be angry with you for a while, but real friends tell each other the truth. Like it or not. Come clean. If she cuts friendship for that simple reason, the friendship was not going to survive in the first place
mAZi1eH7aa	Skip it. He will start to feel like he is being owned. Just be there and be nice and not overly clingy. Nothing sends a guy away more than being around a clingon. <br>  Love him or like him but don't own him. Allow his space and him, yours.|`|Sfy1SnL4aa	awww...i would say that's nice..and cute..|`|G25VY8Anaa	thats kinda weird, its like you want everyone on facebook to know you love him..just tell him
qxpF5IYSaa	Well men really don't like it when a girl rivals them size wise. It sort of questions a persons man hood|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	It is intimidating.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	5ft8 170 is fat for a girl lol, you should weigh 30lbs less|`|AA11795191	Not to burst your bubble, but 170 is slightly overweight for your height. Im 6ft and weigh about 175 and I still have chub. <br>  <br>  And, I have an amazing boyfriend (whos an inch shorter than me) who loves my long sexy legs and my height. Guys preferences vary wildly, so you just have to find someone who is right for you.
Z4MVp8htaa	I am 22 now and have tried most tricks in the book. Like you I have always kinda clung to my men and they too have said this. But over the years I have found that you can scream and shout, cry, talk, leave and nothing seems to make them see what i want/need whatever.<br>  <br>  so firstly are u strong enough to stick this though? I found it so hard but over the year i grew stonger! but getting to the point... I find if i dont say anything and just kinda mirror them i.e. i wont call when i say! I will be late or whatever he is doing I do the same. <br>  <br>  When he finally gets pissed with it i just say o im sorry babe i didnt realise i thought it was ok coz thats how u r with me! i just thought u were cool with it!<br>  <br>  i generally find that that doesnt cause a row coz they cant really say n e thing and it makes them think about the way they are with me!<br>  <br>  win win situation!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck but never put up with n e thing off n e man if u think ur better babe u go find the perfect 1!! he's there somewhere<br>  A. xx|`|ITo6FhPzaa	agree with top

xgJbxZgfaa	he does. just talk to him some more =)|`|cveOUSAuaa	playboy ?|`|ooRxjLXcaa	of course he likes you :]
usj1lyfFaa	Well I was all set to say no until that last sentence.  Even then what would be the point of the relationship?  Now I understand that a relationship can't be based solely on sex, but what you describe is more of a friendship.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, men often times develop feelings towards someone they are having sex with, even if it's supposed to be casual.  I can pretty much guarantee that the man would find a woman to have sex with who had also had a great friendship with.  Meaning you would end up single again.|`|9LuDc9x1aa	maybe its because the men you have slet with have been really bad? or maybe the problem lies deeper than just sex, do you feel insecure/unconfident about yourself? to be honest i think when you meet the right man who you feel extremely attracted to, it will just come naturally anyway. x|`|OZmn1n5qaa	Sounds like a dream setup to me!!!!<br>  <br>  All joking aside (well a LITTLE joking :P)<br>  <br>  There are people that don't care for sex....they don't hate it but it's just not there thing, they are called A-Sexual:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual</a>|`|dnmXybF5aa	no guy will wanna stay with you if you literally *never* have sex with him. seriously how do you enjoy it... theres probably something wrong with you because the body is supposed to enjoy it.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I think there are a number of relationships that end up like you are suggesting but not because it was planned that way - the woman stays because they are otherwise well matched and the guy gets what he can where he can.  It is just a little odd that you are suggesting this from the start.  They say there is someone for everyone, but I think the man would bond with you better if you at least had occasionally sex with him, but also allowed him the freedom to meet his needs elsewhere.  Marriage is almost inherently sexual - at least to some degree.|`|mCoipTkbaa	you don't like sex!!! wow...
dalNxu8zaa	wow a guy yestreday asked the same exact question and u two are the same age and from the same place..<br>  <br>  imma tell u what i told him...<br>  <br>  that i thnk its best if u are uncricumsized..ha ha i have my reasons|`|CBa9G4j4aa	I think a guy should be circumsized. It's better with sex I hear and it is easier to avoid infections and a lot of bacteria because it's easier to clean and keep clean!
RnQFwIuUaa	Sometimes it takes time for a girl to feel comfortable with the idea of someone as a boyfriend. She has to think about it and see if the idea appeals to her. Maybe she doesn't like your type or your build. That's not to say that there is something wrong with you, but everyone likes different things. Good luck
uBssj3Znaa	tell him that you do not want him to move in with you because you want your own space.|`|BO28Mn8haa	tell him it's your first home and you want to do this experience yourself. that later when the relationship is more established you can look into getting a place together|`|2KC467tFaa	Tell him exactly what you wrote here. Tell him it's nothing personal, but you want the experience of having your own place. He should respect that. Tell him you might live together in the future, but you want to ease into things right now. I'm sure you would give him his space if he requested it. You're not in the wrong. Enjoy your new place!|`|7BLJ45cVaa	Start with I don't want you to move in with me. That's all you need to do. If you don't want him to don't let him it's that simple.

Just remember, all you have to do is go to school. Your food is cooked, your wash is done, you hardly have to clean, no rent to pay. Come on! These are the good years.<br>  <br>  And even with all the pressure that surrounds teens today remember: No one stays a teenager forever.|`|SIUIleCzaa	i agree with you.

4gjPQFBDaa	People can be so horrible! Don't worry honey - things in life happen and you can't control them! <br>  <br>  I find lists help! Write a list of everything you need to do and how you are going to do it. <br>  <br>  I take it you are having the house (mum with a baby and all!) so;<br>  1. Take your ex's name off the tenancy agreement (though I think he has to agree to this too)<br>  2. Change the lock's - it's your house now he doesn't need a set of keys! <br>  <br>  And take it logically from there. You should get a reduction on your Council Tax so it will be worth giving them a ring and telling them your partner has moved out. The council tax is based on 2 adults living at that address.<br>  <br>  I think your child benefit and tax credit should go to you because you'll be the main carer (unless of course your baby is going to live with dad). Whatever happens you need to let them know that he has moved out otherwise you may not be getting enough or may be not enough! <br>  <br>  I think the tough one will be the joint account! My partner and I have been together 3 years and decided we're not going to get one - ever! Even if we do we'll only put money in there to pay bills and keep the rest in our personal bank accounts.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would go onto <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk</a> and have a good route around on there. You can find stuff about your benefits and also you can look up registered child minders in your area so that you can look at going back to work in the future. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't go to the CSA if your baby's dad is paying you reguarly! It's just more hassle! My partner's ex was getting paid every single month and she still went to the CSA. Then she kept ringing up every month (for about 3 months) because she wasn't getting the money even though my partner was paying it! So unless you REALLY have too (i.e. he ain't paying) don't go there!<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know if you already have but you can apply for Council Tax & Housing Benefits so that you don't have to pay the full whack alone.<br>  <br>  Stay Strong & Positive Honey!|`|OZmn1n5qaa	Get a job and support yourself instead of relying on tax payers?<br>  <br>  Why the hell would you even take a chance of having a kid if you both were unemployed?<br>  <br>  Man, I am so tired of taking care of everyone else.
AA10510435	Open eyes open pussy!<br>  <br>  My friend always said that the eyes mirror the pussy if she sees you and they "light up" it means you put some fire in her crutch.<br>  <br>  Half soft-eye stare represents the stretching of the Pubococcygeus muscle|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	she touches your arm/leg/hand during conversation, compliments you, over-adjusting her hair/clothes, she looks you straight in the eye, looks at you across the room, smiles a lot, she listens to you without interrupting, laughing at your jokes.<br>  <br>  just little things that you can pick up. she'll just be really friendly to you as well as trying to be sexy...<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	some girls will make it alot more obvious then others.<br>  some will be COMPLETLY upfront. basically they'll tell you up straight.<br>  some will be extremely flirty, i.e.. touching ( when a gril laugha and looks at you and puts her hand on your arm this is a HUGE sign she likes you.)<br>  touching is a major sign.<br>  smiling and tucking her hair behind her ear when you talk to her is a big sign..<br>  if shes with a group of mates but she keeps looking over at you, almost trying to make it look like shes trying to be part of the converstaytion, like laiughing but loking over at you, staring at you..these are signs.<br>  <br>  some girls are quite shy though ): *bless them*<br>  some will flirt to the extreme, some a little, some hardly at all.<br>  im one of the major flirts tbh (: i like to be honest and upfront about it :D<br>  x|`|mTyRnCMmaa	hi, it's me again!<br>  the girl who called you a retard!!!
XatJJQ6Yaa	honestly your friend 'isnt that nice'<br>  especially if she would do that. and if you want to go out with him and SHE breaks up with him, then you should.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Do you mean like pretend you don't like someone.Or to rid yourself of an unwelcome suitor?.Email me and I'll let you know how.
UVnr7wrmaa	Hmm... that sounds like a good idea ! Text her and ask her if she's going, and then approach her in gym and ask her in a nice way if she'd like to go to junior prom with you, because girls like it when men approach them and ask them to their face. <br>  <br>  And she might be a little weirded out if you called her or texted her, seeing as she didn't give you her number. So then she'll be too busy wondering how you got her number instead of accepting your invite to junior prom. <br>  <br>  And if you ask her to junior prom face to face, then she'll think it's sweet that you were able to go right up to her and just ask :) Girls like that in guys, trust me. Just ask her to junior prom whilst you guys are in gym together, or if you just see her wondering along on her own. Girls don't just ask guys to be their dance partner for no reason, so she probably likes you. She wouldn't have asked you if she didn't like you.<br>  <br>  And you're right, it's now or never, hm?|`|HMhUKAgkaa	CALL her. If you text her, she might not take you seriously. Really, though, you shoul do it in person. Then she can have that memory forever.|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Ask her in person.  It makes the best impression, and I've found it has the highest success rate anyway.  It sort of puts them on the spot a little bit, so they'll only agree to go with you if they really want to.  That way you don't end up with any mixed signals, or have a really awkward night together.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Don't text her. Make the phone call.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Sounds good to me.|`|1CgCx1E2aa	call her or meet her, don't text|`|FcovHfZcaa	that sounds good calling her and all but y not asking her to her face simple and ur lil story is pretty kute lol|`|2AdJStDYaa	NO NO NO AHHH<br>  <br>  you HAVE to do it in person. that's the only way you'll see what she thinks about the idea. with computer or phone, you can't see her facial expression, and it gives her too much time. IN PERSON!!|`|0VUFAa6raa	it sounds like a good idea if she asked you to be her dancing partner then i'd say you have a good chance :D<br>  and if i were you i'd either call or ask her personally [in real life/to her face]|`|vEVtXftTaa	Definitely either call or ask her in person - that's the gentlemanly way about it.<br>  Good luck!|`|6YZ74lEOaa	Tell her face to face dude or if your THAT nervous then call her but do NOT text because that isn't a good way ask a girl out in my book.|`|4TN6LSVQaa	dude... ask her in person...<br>  or call    <br>  just don't text|`|kQKFfZAmaa	yes, but you should definitely call her and not text her - it is so much nicer.|`|PNbsCVNraa	it sound normal to me|`|bZZEIjmFaa	It may seem safer to do it that way, however she may see it as stalker'ish and may be turned off, Asking in person is way better, even though if she turns you down it hurts more, but if she laughs at your jokes then you have a very good chance, girls are suckers for a good sense of humor. <br>  <br>  So i would do it in person it is less safe but a better reward when you see her face light up when she says yes and always stay funny|`|SSfXwkpnaa	she'll like it better if you do it to her face but if you dont want to then call her.dont text to 2 impersonal and she'll think your not that bothered.but make sure you have some things prepared to talk about if you do go so thers no awkward silences<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|R8U1m7uvaa	She sounds like she likes you. You should definitly ask either on the phone or in person, don't text it seems not personal. If you do it in person bring a flower...NOT A ROSE, maybe an orchid or something pretty and unique.|`|Iptvlj32aa	Of course you should!  What's the worst thing that could happen?  She says no?  I can guarantee you that even if she says no, she'll still flattered that you asked.|`|333648a40b57c0c7b0a26b7b121beb0eaa	Yes. Go ahead--it sounds like shes intrerested, and at the very least you guys will have a good time.<br>  <br>  Go for it.|`|yGr1VRQSaa	she likes u obviously  but do it in person because once in a while wen u jack a number from a mutual friend its awkward saayin u got it from som one else|`|ik9hP6FBaa	yeah totally, get her number and call her up and ask her. i think that is really cute :)|`|kKbega8yaa	You should ask her either call or ask in person.|`|IlHgnYYMaa	ya dont call or text thats kinda lame lol u should actually talk to her it usually works|`|B1COLthhaa	Thats good ...then if she says yes, in person talk about how exciting its going to be since you said u see her in gym class|`|vrFBkvKeaa	Yes you should, and don't text....call.|`|PJec1EfGaa	ask for her number yourself, <br>  or just ask her to go with you in person. <br>  that is so cute though (;|`|wt4EYPCLaa	totally...but call not text<br>  calling is more personal<br>  texting seems like u don't care that much|`|zl0YHMD5aa	dont call or text speak in private alone with her <br>  amy k XXXXXX|`|d2FJBJ8baa	ask in person you bum!!|`|Mubj1o2eaa	If it's possible ask her in person. Ask to talk to her alone if shes with her crew, because if shes shy and you ask her infront of her friends, she may feel obligated to say yes, and then you will have no fun, or she might say no, but really wants to go with you. So get her alone, then after that, tell her that you have really enjoyed talking to her and you think shes a very sweet person. Try not to go with the outter beauty compliments because that might come off as shallow. And just keeo eye contact and smile at her. And if she says yes, then when you see her in her dress for prom, tell her she looks beautiful, and keep up with the flirty compliments. If she asked you without knowing you to be a dance partner in gym, chances are that she is interested in you. Good luck :}
06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	oh at firtst i meant your general scenet, like you know how every one has a natural scent like from their laundry and stuff#<br>  but you meant.. THAT<br>  smeeling of nothing is DEFINATLY better then smeeling of anything down there.<br>  he has a fetish ... lols... <br>  x|`|zfuDMgafaa	Although you wouldn't want it to smell bad, it's a bit unnatural to have no scent at all, and kind of a turn off. It can seem sterile and clinical. A clean, natural scent is best. Your boyfriend was rude to say it in such an insulting manner though.|`|OFWvYg8waa	because it's unnatural to have no smell down there. he wants the smell of a woman.this will turn him on more than being squeaky clean. maybe you wash/shower too frequently.|`|gpTF7pgsaa	he likes sushi?|`|cbp7Gukbaa	he's a freak! ewwww i bett he likes the smell of his own shiit too lol|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	hey i agree! better than having a bad smell lol<br>  dont worry about it... sometimes guys get turned by odd things like that, so like he knows your aroused etc.    o well|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Human beings are no different than other animals in the fact that the scent of the opposite sex turns them on.  It's chemical, or hormonal.  Still you're right.  A healthy vagina doesn't smell of anything.  It only smells when there's something wrong or during and right after the menstrual cycle.  Trust.

1JsWMX0daa	you are in love with your ex. sometimes u cant help who you love. the other guy loves you more and is also a friend. you will enjoy enjoy him more if you accept him as a best friend and a lover. you will get over your ex in time. good luck.<br>  <br>  p.s. this is a male, also- i think that your new boyfriend sounds like a keeper. girls allways complain about where the nice guys are but then never appreciate when they have one. appreciate him. he deserves it & you will deserve everything he does for you.|`|AA10446398	As long as you e-mail, talk on the phone, or force your thoughts to dwell on him, you'll not get him out of your head.|`|T26GPPYmaa	it's tough u gotta occupy urself<br>  <br>  i'm kinda going through something like that<br>  <br>  email me and we can discuss further|`|B1COLthhaa	When you start thinking about someone you don't have in your life it's because you truly love and miss him. The guy you've known for 6 years is just meant to be your friend and nothing more (it seems like) so go back to your ex and appologize, never break up over something stupid ESPECIALLY if you are having PMS at the time|`|agT8d1d0aa	there is no way but that's the past so get over it there x's for a reason|`|jBVtNmeQaa	I've found in my life generally I've only been able to properly get over somebody when I get into my next relationship, which is generally like a new, fresh start.<br>  <br>  But if you are already in a new relationship and still thinking about the other ALOT, I mean a thought here and there from time to time is completely normal and ok, but it kind of indicates that your current boyfriend is perhaps not exactly what you need, or satisfying your needs fully... But it can be all in the mind, thinking about 'What could've been', which is quite normal but not worth making drastic decisions over. <br>  <br>  You need to think really did you break it off with your last boyfriend on a whim, not really thinking about it properly. Is there still a chance for you guys? What is it about the ex that you think of that your current boyfriend doesn't give you?? Maybe neither of them are good for you? Maybe your just being fussy??<br>  <br>  Just have a good think about it all girly. Good Luck! :-)|`|qSSiV0mmaa	It just takes time.  It is normal to think about an ex & the memories you shared together.  Not to be rude, but your new boyfriend sounds like a wimpy guy.

WpA7n8Iwaa	I don't want to be mean because I realize that we all have a certain type that we like, and it's hard to change.  But I'm afraid that as long as you like the "thug" types, you're going to get used and tossed aside.  There's a reason why they look and act like thugs - because they know that girls fall for it.  <br>  <br>  But don't expect loyalty from a guy like that, and you will always have confusion going when you're with "players".    They only act sweet when they want something.|`|vpmRRamKaa	if he keeps going back to his old gurl<br>  then he really doesnt want you <br>  ---he's using you in other words<br>  and he probably tellls his friends to tell you things like that <br>  but yeah you should really give it up|`|yyIVrngcaa	you are just his booty call...who isn't gonna miss you when they aren't getting stuff elsewhere...<br>  <br>  move on, best of luck*|`|1JsWMX0daa	too much drama! & there's plenty of fish in the sea. move on.|`|72eJOHojaa	all he wants is to use you dont be a booty call go with what you think is right also get to know him really good and get his friends numbers so you can see whats up and whats hees saying gl hope it works and it wasent very smart to give it up so easy|`|lFJIKKkLaa	okay my answer isnt going to be the answer you really want to hear.<br>  but you need to move on.<br>  he oviouslt has feelings for this one girl or they wouldnt still talk or end up getting back together over and over again.<br>  get out and try to find a new guy.<br>  or hey if you want to find out for sure try to hang out or date his friends that way he will have to come back for you.<br>  But the more you sit around and let him know you still like him and that you will always be there, he will be able to not have just only you.<br>  so get strict and date around, because if you guys are meant to be everything will come around.<br>  good luck.<br>  :]|`|CHORH9Ywaa	k, if he is still with his gf, than most likely you are just his booty call. he will say what it takes to get you into bed. sorry but it is true.|`|B1COLthhaa	just remember, if he could cheat on his current girlfriend, how do you know he wouldn't cheat on you as well if you both became an item?|`|MccqAZSNaa	The guy is a scumbag who only wants to get with you.

In a private catholic school everyone's friends because of religion, and everyone has to be nice.. etc. It's just wayy different. At public school people just don't care and are definitley not compassionate. Just keep to yourself, stay out of trouble, and show people that you're a cool dude.|`|tK7XacH7aa	People will make fun of you because they see you as a vulnerable target that is all by themselves. They just make fun of you to make themselves feel better and you should feel sorry for them. You shouldn't really care what people think about you or tell you if you know they are a lie. Just try to join at least some activities so that people can get to know you. If they begin to like you then these problems will be resolved later. Because they'll probably gain a little more respect for you. A girl probably won't go after you because you are too independent and they may listen to the rumors and see you as not  being very confident. Once you show off who you are at whatever you do best they should begin to treat you better. And you may even find a girl that likes you once she gets to know you. Just be yourself and stay positive.|`|gVMmdeLcaa	this kind of experience is character building. i kno at the moment u dnt care about that but u will come out a better and stronger adult as a result of this experience. Be nice to people, dnt retaliate to their foolishness, have confidence, although its hard, and hang in there! Sooo many ppl b4 you have been there...|`|4F1dYuC6aa	You call them "pretend friends", when they are really buddies.  Buddies are people that are only your friends when you both are doing something together for a cause.  A friend will hang around with you even when there is no purpose to hang-out.<br>  <br>  Most high school girls likes going after the guys that are involved with some kind of extracurricular activity, so you may want to try that.  That may help get people accepting you.
OYGGdSLcaa	Yes, he definitely likes you. As for the awkwardness of the physical situation, consider who is around you. Even if he likes you and is openly showing interest if his ex-girlfriend is around, he's not going to talk much. Ex-girlfriends, no offense, are as unpredictable for us guys as your mood swing during that T.O.M. There is also the factor of him not wanting to look like a chauvenistic pig in front of the other students. as to how to make it less awkward, you might try initiating a conversation with him at school. if your school does a sadie hawkins dance (which should be coming up) ask him to it. it takes the burden off of him, and allows both of you to pass safely beyond the awkward "pre-dating of your best friends ex" stage. <br>  <br>  If you need any more help, from a metro bi-guy e-mail me.<br>  dccoston1991@yahoo.com|`|Fn6vayT4aa	think about why they broke up and how maybe he could just use you to get back at her and even if a friend told me i could date her ex i still wouldnt it will make probs later on with you and her|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Did your friend say why they broke up.  details please.|`|0bS6FNeDaa	quick answer, never date a friends cast off...  He may be doing this thinking you'll relay it back to your friend, He may also be a complete jerk to be talking to a friend of his x.  And no doubt he will do the same thing to you.  No mature man or woman would ever get involved with a guy who dated a friend...on top of that if your good enough to talk to at home why not at school in front of everyone.  Don't be an easy catch and don't sell yourself or your friends trust short.|`|OWZGk40Taa	i dont know|`|xc9MkZWJaa	needs more details,<br>  so we can help|`|Rf515Ednaa	ok this is tricky to explain. hes not good with girls. he doesnt know what to do. he acts like he knows what to do. but he doesnt. i think u shouold tlak to him and come up with something and see if he looks in your eyes and looks confident when he tlaks to you. if he only tlaks to you around other people then hes shy and doesnt understand girls yet. im a freshman, and in seventh grade i usde to be like him. i texted JUSt like him. i didnt understand girls in seventh grade. but i grew up and now i do. so wat u should do is become closer to him and try to talk to him. id ont know what else to say! i wish you the best of luck!|`|GAfJu156aa	YOU GUYS ARE SHY. Hahaha duh! Talk through online crap is so much easier than in person. He probably feels insecure and shy around you if he likes you this much. Through texting or whatever, it gives him a chance to think about what he has to say and he feels comfortable. Just go up to him and make him laugh. It'll break the ice. If you guys look at eachother, cross your eyes and giggle. It'll show you're approachable in person.|`|S6rB7GgFaa	He probably likes you, but his problem is problem 1 of these 3 things.

Putting your hand in his hair might make him want it a little more.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Sounds like you need to go ahead and make it happen.  Go on in, and kiss him.

I do this to my boyfriend and it drives him nuts. Especially when he knows he can't kiss me right then and there. When you are really close, look directly into his eyes. Don't look away. Smile just a little bit. Just so he knows you're happy. Then glance at his lips, but then look directly back into his eyes. Keep smiling. Then look away and laugh just a little bit. Almost like a happy chuckle haha :)|`|Zn2RHqG1aa	Definitely make the move! My past boyfriends, after the relationships, have always told me how much they loved that sometimes I would be spontaneous and kiss them first or out of the blue. <br>  <br>  If you wait, it may be while but worth it. But if you are anything like me, and are too impatient then go for it! You'll feel great after wards.|`|K9NLPzxGaa	Well if he's told you he wants to kiss, then go to somewhere where it would usually happen e.g. a cinema. then get him to look at you (stare at him until he looks at you) and then get closer slowly. he will get what your trying to say and hopefully go for it. also try flirting a bit before you kiss him because he may not be in the mood... :)|`|jbdiQ2eFaa	make a move. sometimes guys get turned on by that kind of stuff :]|`|y332rI1Vaa	kiss himm|`|FcgNSUlQaa	Like good ol' Nike says: "Just do it."|`|rb8wwOzVaa	just stick out the kissy face and wait til he kisses you|`|AA10437294	he's probably nervous. you make the first move|`|b1jyPAsKaa	wait till  your ready and when your ready kiss him|`|kH2ZLnnuaa	Just start by kissing his cheek and work your way to his lips.

I don't think that what you are doing is wrong. I do it myself, however, my partner thinks it's great and I tell him about it all the time. I also have no problem with him doing it.

It was hard. The woman is going to feel to blame. Even though she is not at all. The best thing you can do for her is just be there. Let her talk it out. Let her cry. Tell her you love her. Be strong for her. I promise that the pain won't last. You are right it is natures way of saying it wasn't right. Let her have a few days to grieve and then take her out to dinner, get her mind off of things. <br>  <br>  Best of LUCK!|`|UUrqECXIaa	I'm sorry to hear of your loss.

Let her know that it was not her fault (after one of my miscarriages I had a couple of people imply that I must have done something to cause it-idiots).|`|0Id85yiYaa	i am so sorry for your loss. just be strong for her. you can still grieve and talk to her about your sadness, but it's a little different for her. i had one a year and a half ago and it took me about a year to come to terms with it. it's probably one of the hardest things for you guys to go through, but the positive in this is that she CAN get pregnant and having one miscarriage doesn't mean that she will have any type of fertility problems. <br>  <br>  i wish you the best.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Nothing will magically make her forget this or stop hurting any sooner. <br>  Basically just continue to be there for her. Love her. that's what she needs the most right now. Maybe even find a spa in your area that offers couples massages. and set it up for the 2 of you to go together. Me and my husband have done that, and not only is it relaxing, it's also romantic and helps with stress levels. <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|tVqLmImUaa	Book her a weekend at a spa retreat. Or even just a day at a local spa to get massage/facial/pedicure etc.  It's a day out just for her. She will get a chance to relax, release stress and indulge, and she'll LOVE you for it.

You may surprise yourself.r|`|qN7xNavCaa	well i have many lesbian friends and everybody loves them. so if they dont like it screw em!|`|fc6ca08c0bc93a3479afd64cc1c976d0aa	you cant help what u are find some girls at your school who are lesibeans too you wont feel like a loner no more.
K6JSNQJQaa	I guess you have to come to your own conclusion on that one.  I find so many questions on here silly and stupid, probably out of sheer boredom from the person asking.  Every now and then you'll get on that makes perfect sense to you and you even get a nice "thank you" from that person...that's really a nice thing.

iNXYi2kaaa	um he might like the attention but i dont think he likes u as near as much as u like him... move on.... he probally aint comming around|`|PrdQZMfLaa	No, he doesn't really care about you. if he was interested he wouldn't have acted like that and he should have apologized to you for what he did but no he really doesn't care. Go find someone better who deserves you :)|`|XtmPYHyJaa	sorry to say it may be a joke my sises friend had something like this happen and the boy was actuly a girl who hated my sises friend|`|P8yQyumPaa	it seems like he is afraid to get close to you . cause he's probably not ready for a commitment right now . but he doesn't know how to tell you that with out being mean so when you keep making the first move. asking him if he wants to hang out. that makes him nervous because he doesn't want to hurt you because right now he juss wants to be friends and then maybe later on he would want to date you <br>  so juss take things slow. he's not going anywhere <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226145005AAWuKmD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|6tcXKcBgaa	It seems that he is just not that into you. <br>  If he really liked you, he would show it and you would know.<br>  He could also be a lazy fart & you need more than that in a male <br>  so get over him! He may also have some phychological issues.|`|Mz1XNJxdaa	Well most of the time, in the beggening of relationships .. its supposed to be the best. but if its already starting off with confusion and no shows ... maybe its not worth it. Maybe it will get better maybe it wont. Do you really wanna take that chance?|`|qS35btkHaa	hes not using you. <br>  <br>  you just need to find out if he likes you.<br>  it sounds like he does.<br>  <br>  talk to his friends about it, flirt a little and you can get anything|`|SQ1cOAEHaa	He seems alittle wierd.....i wouldnt trust him imo|`|Uy9UWQAUaa	Well I don't think "using" you is the right word...but there is something wrong with that picture... I say you tell him if he wants to talk he has to message you.... If nothing happens then just move on he is not worth waiting in the balance for obviously|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	Well when he said that he's a "little out of it" he was probably high as a kite and felt uncomfortable going to your parents house..So I'll give him that...but seems like he's just not likeing you the way you like him..But don't let that get you down, he doesn't seem like much of winner anyway. Let him be the one to chase you, not the other way around..good luck.|`|QVQdcmrgaa	ok so why would you want a guy that doesnt talk to you<br>  this dude sounds sketchy to me<br>  id  try to find someone better
v2jxHGg5aa	ok so yeah i've been in this same spot.  you shouldn't end up going out with him if you only like him as a friend.  and if he asks you out, tell him right then and there, sorry i just want to be your friend.  he might be sad, but it's better than going out with someone you don't like.  that ends up making things worse|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	just talk about it<br>  if he is so understanding<br>  there won't be a problem|`|hjS7HA7daa	Just tell him you don't fancy him, he'll respect you more, than leading him on.

7gH7sgi6aa	This is the hardest part of what you are going through.  I went through something similar and your counselor is correct.  Right now you don't need to talk to them.  Explain to them, or have your Sister explain to them that right now you need time to heal and are seeking counseling and will contact them when YOU feel then the time is appropriate.  You are going to need to learn to set new personal boundaries with them but that all will come much later with your counselor.  Take care of you right now.  God bless you.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No it is not wrong thinking like that, you would think your parents would understand.|`|Z2xETWhbaa	WOW,  I am so sorry to hear about what happened to you.  It is completely wrong for your parents to take his side.  You are not in the wrong and you did the right thing.   I know it may be hard but I don't think that you should talk to them anymore.  You have been through enough and don't deserve the crap that they keep giving you.  Get rid of the poisen in your life and you will be much happier.  By poisen I mean your parents
AWOqn9SKaa	hah you remind me of myself (but i' m a guy). I had almost the same problem that is living in the ghetto and liking a girl that's from a totally different world.<br>  The best thing you should do is go for it. Don't get all these negative thoughts inside your mind it will just get in your way and eventually lead you to no where.<br>  Start talking to him again, try to do things that will get you closer with him to spend more time to get your feelings for each other back up. It ain't awkward if hes rich and your from the ghetto because if you two truly like each other nothing matters.<br>  Once you two start getting closer together then you could tell him or just simply tell your friends to give him hints to find out if he likes you back. <br>  Goodluck!|`|QSShHlRiaa	Your wierd...|`|tfIwNKfkaa	i say tell him!!! if he likd u de chances r dat he still has some kind of feelins 4 u !!! and he prob dont care bo ani of dat stuff bo him bein rich!!! if u didnt notice he was rich den, dont seem lik he wants ta show it!!<br>  <br>  im 14 2!! answer mine!! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090223132548AA97FC9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|Rt1FfBchaa	hmmmm.....just tell him what you just said now
Uj5kuzoJaa	Not weird and no you're not related. It's actually easier for Family gathering because then there's only one family on each side. It's kind of cool.|`|4wm5kAygaa	Well your not technically related, well at least not by blood, so I don't think its a big deal. It's not like dating your cousin or brother or something. I don't think it matters what other people think but if you feel okay about it than go for it.|`|F89MNQheaa	You are not blood related and you are not commiting any crime, my gran and her sister married two brothers back in the 50's and nothing has changed since then so if you like this guy go for it.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	No, i guess its not weird....I've seen on TV one set of twins will marry another set of twins. Its not incest or anything.  Yeah, I think its okay to date.|`|s5RuRBdpaa	no its not weird...my mom and her sister married my dad and his brother......(two sisters married two brothers)   you know what I mean|`|VygBNA0Waa	no its normal have fun you are not related at all|`|1LgXCEgtaa	It might be a little weird for your brother-in-law or even your sister.

dBDxfrLFaa	nerdy<br>  <br>  the popular kids only wanted you after the touch down! do you really think they want you for who you are... i mean your personalities? <br>  <br>  in my school, is kind of the same. i hang out with both. <br>  I have friends that are popular, and friends that seems to only know me and are nerdy.<br>  i only hang out with the popular because at lease the popular kids are good people and like me for who i really am. I also hang out with the nerdys because they help me and always are there for me also.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	I think (nerdy) like you call them, which it is sad you refer to them that way, but All I can say is that those kind of people are the nicest and friendliest in the world and they always got your back in whatever reason but think about it, fake or real friends are important to have?|`|03GQ637Raa	I would say neither.  Befriend those kids that will be a real true blue friend.  If they happen to be popular or nerdy, so be it.  You would be a real shallow person to judge friendship on popularity or nerdiness.|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	both|`|C6XzxjKvaa	both. its not like you're commiting your life and soul to either so whats wrong with hanging with both? if your "nerdy friends" are people you normally hang out with, then tell them that you have the right to hang with others. clear up misunderstandings and if they cant understand, then they obviously need to back off a bit.|`|LAYJxqrHaa	well if the "nerds" are your friends they would let you hang out with them they can't be like oh yeah you can't hang with them you should be aloud to hang out with whoever you want, it's up to you now to make the right decision|`|05mJnGdmaa	If u think u can be able to make touchdowns every time you play with them and be yourself go ahead. Do the nerdy friends rly mind who u are or not|`|VMY7No0eaa	NERDY ones will end up with all the money (look at Bill Gates)|`|yzEC5O6gaa	wow what if ur "nerdy" friends are ur normal then tats kinda mean to say tat. wellll anyywhooo i would say nerdy cuz somtimes the popular people and ditch you for someone else and u might not get ur nerdy firneds back or wat u cna do is just hang out wiht both.
uBssj3Znaa	she is an adult who can go out whenever she pleases.|`|JUXpVYC4aa	it's her life not yours............|`|hF6uZqWRaa	im 20. My sister is 22 and her bf is 25. Her bf knew that my sister loved to go out and loved to dance. They moved in together and spend a lot of time together. When the weekend comes she goes out every weekend friday to sunday. her bf is really Relax and not jealous at all (my bf is the total opposite) when her bf doesn't feel like going out or short in money he would stay home and sometimes my sister stays too. One thing im going to tell you is that you can change her...my mom says my sister is just like my dad. loves to go out and spend money. my dad is 41 years old and he hasn't changed. he goes out in his bike and goes to bars with his friends mean while my mom is at home (my mom hates going out).... just talk to her and she what are her plans...is she going to stop going out or is she going to be like my sister or dad. :) good luck.|`|xG2bbN0haa	A girl needs time for herself too.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  This can be a rough situation because especially if she's a really friendly girl, that can come off as flirty, and if she's attractive on top of that guys are going to want to get at her because they can be pigs like that (no offense)<br>  <br>  I'm a female, I'm in my 20's, and although I'm straight edge (so I don't drink or do drugs) I never really understand the whole going out stuff if you are talking about if she is partying. Partying/Clubbing would make me personally uncomfortable if my boyfriend was a drinker and went out and did that stuff, I wouldn't really be jealous, but I would be worried about his safety or girls trying to get at him because that's just annoying not to mention disrespectful.<br>  <br>  If she is going out with a couple girlfriends and they are going out to eat or movies and things like that, then I don't consider that to be such a big deal because that's just normal girl time, just like guys have their bro time.<br>  <br>  I think that if she is going out and it's in the partying/club/bar sense that you should tell her that it makes you uncomfortable (if it does) but you aren't going to limit her and try to control her, you don't seem like that type of guy from what you wrote.<br>  <br>  Just tell her that you'd really like to spend time with her so that your relationship can grow. Ask her if you could tag along with her some nights. If she has a problem with you tagging along a couple of nights, I personally would be offended, because it would be like...what do you have to hide? <br>  <br>  You have to have trust in her and she has to have trust in you, this is something you should really just sit down and talk to her about. I'm sure if you are open, and talk about it maturely, not fight over it, that you could feel a lot better about her going out and maybe you could figure out what would be good times for her to go out and for her to be with you, and like I said maybe even have you go with her when she is out.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this wasn't much help to you, good luck, all the best! :-)

LxZFioqwaa	Let her tell you. Usually it happens during or before sex.<br>  <br>  Wait my friend.<br>  You'll find out then have sex straight after! You get 2 things you wanted!!|`|jbvBBoFRaa	If she really likes you, it wont ruin your relationship.  Their isnt anything wrong talking about sex in a relationship, its perfectly normal.  Just one day start the conversation and go with it.  If she seems shy and hesitant, you will know.|`|Iz4hQXXRaa	don't ask! you could hint that you want to know if you REALLY want to, but make sure she doesn't take it as though you want it to be one way or another.|`|4QctT4uzaa	Just Be Secure About It Say,<br>  "whats the farthest you have gone with someone"<br>  If Its been five months this shouldn't offend her.<br>  Its better then saying "are you a virgin?"<br>  aha.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12359831	just ask her... i think she'd understand that your just curious.<br>  but when she tells you. and she isnt. dont keep asking about it.|`|faeXRQmcaa	No, you dont have to wait until then. Just bring out the subject!|`|zOtR2Cifaa	just ask her, if your that age, its not a big deal|`|MmdWM51faa	i wouldnt it could make things awkward or make her mad|`|KpPmgiKiaa	Ask her. <br>  <br>  Ask her, ask her ask her. There is nothing a girl wants more than to know that a guy is considerate of her feelings, her wants, and her fears. If I had a partner, I would most certainly want to be asked.<br>  <br>  But do it in a nice way. Say something like "I really, really like you. And, someday, I'd like to get closer to you. But, I want you to be ready too." Ask her in a sensitive way. But ask her! Let her know that you're considerate about it, and that you want her to be happy and comfortable with any choices that are being made.<br>  <br>  God love your heart for caring.|`|ac3HAiOKaa	Would her answer make a difference to you?  If it would then perhaps you don't deserve her...<br>  <br>  Next time you two are making out see how far she'll let you go... if and when she stops you she'll probably feel the need to explain herself... which may get you her answer...|`|tsfbV5PPaa	Just ask her. and respect it if she doesn't want to answer. But I am sure that she will  not be offended by the question.|`|e7Midrsoaa	just bring up the subject and see if she says anything. does it really matter?|`|AA10928214	Yeah, wait til you're engaged to find out she's slept with 500 guys and has herpes. Why can't you ask her straight out.. 5 months.. you should be comfortable enough to know this kind of information. You've never talked about it? Weird relationship at that age.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	well she seems old enough to handle the question so just go on and ask her. if she says y do u want to know that personal than yeah she is a v. but if she says jaja or just plain no then she is not a v.|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	My ex-boyfriend and I had that talk on our first date. I can't remember who brought it up though. I think it just came about in the conversation. If she's not open about it, I wouldn't ask.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|IFHzCyOkaa	your 20? wow. 5 months? even if she was a virgin if that was me she wouldn't be a virgin anymore..5 months is a long time!

At least he didn't do something really mean and tell you he wasn't into you, he's just Gay, and he's not into girls so it's nothing about you or looks, or anything like that, that usually gets girls down when it comes to situations like this. <br>  <br>  You just have to understand that this guy really cares about your best friend and your best friend cares about him. Which is great, you should be happy for them. There is really no use in staying sad or upset over this because he is Gay, there is no way that you could ever change that, this is probably one of the easiest situations I heard to get over. <br>  <br>  There is so many other guys out there, why focus on someone that is never going to be into girls? You are just wasting time that you could spend meeting other guys and talking to other guys.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out a bit, sorry if it did not, good luck though, all the best! :-)|`|ZFWvaCJPaa	first of all hes not straight so get over him

Sometimes it takes a while for a woman to open up to her own feelings about someone she really likes. I hope that made enough sense to help you....|`|GGwOjodDaa	Dude she must be shy or she moved on plus how do you know that she likes you? Or she thinks your kind of a jerk after ingoring her.|`|TIAbvBkpaa	at first, if she liked you, she would've been talkative and flirty. but since you ignored her, she thinks that you don't like her so it probably got a little awkward and embarrassing for her. now, she thinks you're just trying to "make it up to her." she can tell you feel bad but she wants you too because you made her feel bad at first. <br>  <br>  haha sorry... i hate to break it to you.<br>  good luck|`|I4eki5Ugaa	Uhmm, i had a experience kind of like this girl (but not really). i liked this guy names Matt and i liked him for a while. My friend told him that i liked him. He didn't like me back so i started to try to suppress my feelings for him. We don't talk much but we look at each other in the hallway.<br>  <br>  I think this girl thinks that you might hate her or something because of the first time you ignored her. That might be the reason why she's not talking to you or not responding much when you talk to her.<br>  <br>  That's all i got, sorry<br>  hope it helps.|`|Hi9i2orDaa	because you ignored her and she took a hint and now that you talk to her she might think you saw that she liked you and that is the only reason you are talking to her,not because you like her but because you are taking pitty on her|`|yyMRQkEmaa	1. payback<br>  2. you hurt her feelings<br>  3. she doesnt like you anymore<br>  4. she doesnt like the way you treated her<br>  5 she is 95% over you<br>  6. she doesnt want to talk to you because she thinks your going to hurt her again<br>  <br>  <br>  2 would be my complete guess!|`|FOky1WqWaa	It sounds like she was hurt when you ignored her, and is under the impression that you're only talking to her because you feel pity for her.|`|xUYjWMCYaa	She knows your only talking to her out of pitty. Not going to lie that would piss me off too. Other than that just keep trying to talk to her|`|EZJg0G1kaa	cause she asked you if you can go to occasion and you ignored her! she might have felt really unhappy when u did that! so when you talk to her she feels unhappy.
NW1oQMtGaa	Whenever both of you argues or make a fight or have problems you both take time off or separate?That is not a good idea! how can your relationship last and become strong and intact if it will not stand the test of time or simple and petty arguments only your relationship already collapses.If you love him fight for your love for him,definitely,time will test you and your relationship but do not give up so easily or do not yield.<br>  <br>  Arguments and problems are nothing in a relationship if both of you love each other so dearly nothing will keep you apart from one another.If you have arguments solve it at once,would you allow that this petty arguments will ruin your love and relationship?are these petty arguments are more stronger than your love for him?If these arguments are more stronger than your love for him that you easily give in into it,surely you relationship will not last.<br>  <br>  Arguments and Problems have successfully then done its mission,that is, to break your relationship or to ruin any relationship.Would you allow it to ruin and destroy your love for him?|`|POHWTDPRaa	The only way to fix your problems is to fix your problems. You can't split up and expect them to go away. You have to do the work. <br>  <br>  Every couple fights but if you are having "tons" of arguments it doesn't sound like you are working too well together. If you think you can make it work then good luck to you. But don't confuse something that is familiar for something that is good. And don't stay in the relationship and try to force it just because you don't want to miss him. Everyone misses their ex when they break up. But they all broke up for a reason and they are probably better off that way.|`|3uBv1X0caa	if you are both on the same page/end up on the same page; taking time off is a great idea.<br>  <br>  it lets you realize how important they are to you and how much you need them in your life. like you said; 'you dont know what youve got til its gone;' its the same principle: 'absence makes the heart grow fonder.' <br>  <br>  when you both know what you want to do; talk about your future plans and whether or not you want them to include eachother. hope this helps!|`|95gVLrIGaa	Having tons of arguments all the time isn't necessarily healthy. What's more important is how good the couple is at resolving them or coming to a compromise.<br>  <br>  It's human nature to take things for granted. Once you get used to something, you forget about what it's like to not have it in your life until suddenly it's not there anymore. It's perfectly normal, although it's even better to strive to always be grateful for what you have.<br>  <br>  Here's my thoughts on getting back together with an ex. Generally when someone thinks about a prior relationship, they're thinking about how they felt and how that person was at that point in time, hoping that if they get back together with them that it will be "just like old times." But depending on how long they've been apart, that usually doesn't happen. People change over time, and you can't live in or recreate the past. But if you both are seriously committed to each other and the time is right, it might be worth another try.
BKr3y30maa	Just start the conversation off asking her about her interests: music, tv shows, movies.....stuff like that.  Talk to her about school, friends, and family.  Start off with the simple things. Don't ask her about past relationships though.   These simple things will not only keep the conversations running smoothly but will also help you get to know her.  Email me if you have anymore questions.
3NoQuoWuaa	Your son assured you he won't have sex with her? The moon doesn't exist either. It is just a big ball of cheese out there. You need to explain to him the realities of statuary rape. Since he is an adult there isn't much you can do about it but you can inform her parents. If he persists then he may wind up going to jail or maybe her father will just beat the living crap out of him. He needs a wake up call.r|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	he shud not be dating a 15 year old.<br>  tell him to stop dating her until she is at least 16.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	If you really trust your son not to mess with this kid... well... there ya go. You need to spell out to him what the laws are like... statutory rape and all that... and if she has a big family, he's better be on good terms with them or he could be in more direct trouble.|`|jCB7S6sfaa	his best intrest should be getting away from her. she is probaly using him to buy alchol and ciggerettes. 15 year olds theses days are sluts these days and come on what would you do if you were 22 and seen a 15 year old who has maybe had sex with one person you tell me|`|vXotXl1Laa	She's got his life in her hands. Your concern is justified. Don't wait for something bad to happen. All it takes is a suspicion from the 15 year old or any of her family member(s).<br>  Good Luck.|`|YFXusnT1aa	You can always alert the police|`|99teIRU7aa	That situation can be dangerous, Dont freak out though. You need to do a couple of things. <br>  1.) Talk to your son like an adult, respect him, tell him that he must be carefull and aware of his actions.<br>  2.) Make him feel that your happy that he is in a relationship.<br>  3.)Tell him that her mother has to find out about this relationship, its dangerous if you dont.<br>  4.) Find out if your son and his girlfriend, and her mother, can make a contract, incase their is sex.<br>  ****I hope I helped!! Best of luck!|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well you should tell her mother. It is obvious that your son is sexually active; he's 22, so hes thinking about screwing her. She is too young anywys and might cheat or want to explore so tell ur son that. Also, is she a bad person, let him live his life if she is good to him.|`|7BLJ45cVaa	You need to sit him down and ask him if he wants to ruin his life. Even if he says he won't touch her, seriously we've all been there. That age difference is really dangerous legally speaking. He needs to just find someone else, he will thank you in ten years.|`|qN7xNavCaa	well mam thats just creepy and im sorry to say it but your son should get a life and get with a woman his own age and not a little girl.
BKr3y30maa	Communication is the key.  Ask him what he likes.  Then whatever it is you are willing to do, then do it.  Also try different positions that you've never tried, sex toys, do a sexy striptease, talk dirty, maybe watch a porn together, try wearing a sexy costume (nurse, maid), motion lotions, handcuffs.....stuff like that.  Doing a bunch of different things instead of the same repetitive stuff is what keeps it fun and interesting. Hope I helped.|`|ih1JD5xYaa	Try different things together...variety is the spice of life after all|`|SiyalC2Waa	well, if you keep practicing, things get better. if you two are both very open with each other, don't be afraid to bring s&m onto the table.ask him questions on what he likes and what makes him feel good and always define your limit, if any.also, it doesn't hurt to watch porn to have examples, but don't take it too close to heart because although it's a representation of sex and how it should be at times, it will not always be like that.
WpA7n8Iwaa	He may not be messing with you, but when a person doesn't talk to you and you get a little distance, you start remembering the good things and you miss them.  It's human nature.  He wants the best part of the relationship without the rest.  But you can't have it that way!!!  Guys seem to have a natural instinct to "turn on the charm" when they want to.  Don't fall for it!!!!   <br>   <br>  I'm sure there are a lot of good things between you two, but probably not enough for a lasting relationship.   If you're sure that you can't have a relationship, then just tell yourself that no matter what he says or if he smiles at you or no matter how sweet he acts, you're committed to moving on.  It gets sooooo much easier with time.|`|zscuDpaIaa	Tell him about his personality and what hes doing and how its effecting your emotions. See what he says, and try to get over him. Be nice to him but dont talk to him so much that you'll fall for him. Or just completely stop talking to him....|`|ojiO3svoaa	just leave him alone|`|fHTvjaYtaa	Okay you asked for a Mature Answer.  You know it would not be a good relationship.  When you talk to him you fall for him all over again.  It seems you can't keep your thoughts straight.  I know it is hard when you are young and your hormones are raging.  Been there, done that......As an older woman (elderly actually)...with years of experience......just ask yourself:  Do I want to live like this for the REST of my life?  (With the relationship as you see it with the ups and downs)...................If the answer is:  NO!!<br>  <br>  Keep it on a friendly basis when you talk to him and MOVE ON, SISTA.......I do wish you all the best luck in the world.|`|WfTRGSOdaa	i think i know how you feel<br>  but if your sure you couldnt work out<br>  leave him alone <br>  seriously<br>  if you never know what to expect from him<br>  he's not even worth it as a friend<br>  you need to complete stop talking to him<br>  or try anyways<br>  cuz even if you have alittle bit of feelings  for him, it wont be easy|`|yyIVrngcaa	He's doing that because he's a lonely, desperate loser...No girl is giving him attention, the only thing he can do to possibly attract one (you) is by being nice which he really isn't...he just uses that as a means of getting a girl interested in him.<br>  just forget him...find someone else.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Find someone new. He's toying with you. Remember, guys will get away with what you let them!! Just ignore his calls and find another guy. It's so much easier to get over someone when you have a new someone distracting you and making you feel good : )|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Just don't take his calls.  If you know that a relationship isn't going to work, why waste any more time on him?<br>  <br>  Tell him to stop bothering you, and ignore him completely.  If he's really persistent, change your number.|`|a984cQjKaa	change your phone number, and your screenname if you talk online.  the boy is bad news, and the only way to get over him is to avoid him.|`|bZZEIjmFaa	Guys are stupid, just try to keep space between you. If you gave him a serious shot and it didn't work out then let it be<br>  <br>  Guys are stupid!!!!|`|YTHmYqllaa	he wants to be with you as he thinks your amazing<br>  he is resenfull at the fact that you gave up.|`|OuPtLtfmaa	4 get him. go to the mall or something and go eye candy shopping|`|yYG50duyaa	guys think differently to what girls think and to be honest it's hard to understand them, i'm not tellin you to change your number, email and all that, just take it step by step. when he talks to you sweetly (flirting) dont flirt back just pretend he's a normal mate. it's really hard to get over someone, every girl knows that, you'll get over him eventually and it'll heal in time, behind every storm there's sunn :D x|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Recognize this for the Drama it is and decide that Drama is not what you want in life. Do not answer your phone, email, whatever and if you see him in person just be honest about his Bipolar deal and tell him that you just don't need that in your life. Nothing against him personally. Just your preference. There are plenty of girls out there who love the up and down crap. I am sure he will find that perfect girl out there for him.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	OMG I know exactly what you are going thru. Dont talk to him. It will be hard as anything you will ever have to do but you can do it. Trust me. Stop the communication. STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT. Once he's out your system you will wonder what you saw in him in the first place and possibly gain the strength to TELL him you dont want to communicate with him anymore if he decides to call you out the blue.|`|n65bjVokaa	Been there, done that. Just ignore him. That's really all you can do. Or you could tell him that you are dating someone else and that you would really appreciate it if he wouldn't contact you anymore. You CAN move on. It doesn't sound like it was a really serious relationship, so it shouldn't be too hard if you ignore the guy.|`|ptPvDdU8aa	kk ive done the same thing to a girl before and i think the reason he is doing it is to push you to see how far you will go without getting mad and he is trying to figure out what your boundary line is and to see whether you will react to him and he is trying to find out wat your limits are and to see if you will react to him|`|745966f59f25a953659cbe30cf713bc4aa	Girl, this guy needs to made up id mind. That for sure. If you like him you need to have talk with him and ask him what's going on? But if you don't want a relationship with him ignore him. Don't answer the phone, the text. NOTHING!!!|`|1JsWMX0daa	it seems he doesn't know what he wants. OR you are his back up, if he hasn't had any play action in a while he tries to fall back on you. stop talkin to him and find a guy who will make you his first & only choice, not a back up.|`|SSfXwkpnaa	he seems like he doesnt know if he likes you or not so either ask him or be distant and see if he says anything but you should try to get over him -if he's like this now he'll be like it in a relationship and it would be horrible not to know where you stand with your partner|`|sP4KSFvQaa	He's obviously seen something he likes in you. You may just want to tell him, "You're very charming! We've been out more than a couple of times and I've decided it just isn't going to workout for me. We are very different people."|`|6kgin3FJaa	He's playin ya.  He sounds like he doesn't know what he wants either.  Best to not get involved with him.  In the long run you will be hurt.  It's ok to talk and be friends but don't get caught in him head games.|`|BiXBWADmaa	find another guy to date the only way you will forget about the last one and he sounds like he just is doing it because hes ether lonly or just want you one second then doesnt the next|`|QSCfsNEHaa	Maybe he's going through some things...why dont you talk to him about it and see what's wrong. And also tell him how you feel when he acts that way towards you.|`|ik9hP6FBaa	i honestly think that you should move on, just leave him alone|`|B1COLthhaa	Here are all the possibilites I could think of for you: Sometimes guys are talking to a few girls at the same time. Guys get mood swings just like girls. Sometimes men expect things from a girl & when girls don't live up to his expectations he feels a little bit angered by it. Also, his personality might be the type that he gets mad over something and he pushes it on other people. He might've had the preconception that girls like to be treated badly (meaning ignored) because that'll get them to be more interested. I hope those possibilites helped.<br>  You don't have to move on completely, just find another guy and hold him on the side, when he sees you're not serious maybe he'll clean up his act.<br>  Good luck! <3|`|am3pMm9Taa	I agree with the other answer. Try to just ignore him you know. Honestly he sounds like he is being a little imature. It sounds like hes only respecting what he wants and not what you want. Just tell him how you feel. Dont be to harsh, but harsh enough if that makes since. When you always fall for what he says than thats letting him know that he can get you when ever he wants and thats not right. kind of like having you rapped around his finger. Every relationship will have there ups and downs, but if theres more ups than downs then that should be telling you something right there. Best of luck to you and i hope you find that Mr. right.|`|uQlD1Zffaa	Get involved with something else that you love doing, working out, crafting, reading, anything. Go out with girlfriends a lot and try meeting new people. I went throught this situation in high school. The guy did the same thing to me, and we were supposed to be friends but every time I had a boyfriend he would freak out and want me to be with him. STILL to this day we are friends and I'm married and he refers to me as the "one who got away". I did get away thank God and I'm happily married!|`|3quPfcVfaa	stop  talking to him|`|3UIlEp4Daa	Well it sounds to me like he is just trying to play some mind games with you, and that is the beginning of an unhealthy start to a relationship. Do you really want to fall madly in love with him and then have him start acting this way again, don't let him break your heart. If you feel he isn't right for you, then he isn't right for you! Guys can be deceiving and all they make you feel like all you want to do is be with them (because they seem so perfect), look at him and think is this who and what I really want?|`|wBcbKf5Jaa	He is bouncing back and forth between different girls.  When he has another girl or when he has you right were he wants you, likely submissive to him, he will be mean to you.  When he doesn't have a girl, or he feels like he is losing you, he will sweet talk you to lure you back in.  This guy probably won't be changing at all and if he does decide to grow up it likely won't be soon.  I'd stay away from him or you are going to get your heart broken.  I should know, I did something similar to a girl, and it took me a while to finally grow up, but she got a broken heart in the process...|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	move on, there's plenty of other fish in the sea. don't waste your life on a guy with a split personality.|`|uBssj3Znaa	yeah, easy, stop talking to him all together. If you know it isn't going to work out, why keep dragging yourself in.
E4bCssjfaa	I have the almost exact situation you are in except my sister is older..[strange huh?] I don't really know much of what to do. Sometimes your parents would believe your younger sister instead of you because of the fact that shes younger and "doesn't know better". One thing you Could do is leave a camera out when your parents leave and are alone with your sister and tape the whole incident-therefore you'd have proof.<br>  <br>  hope I helped ^.^"|`|qjy5OirNaa	i hate my sister too
asEM3kQmaa	if you dont like to go out with  that girl.  you should tell her the truth or give her a good reasons. you know what I mean. honestly, I never asking guys out..  I bet it feels embarrassing to turn down get turn down..<br>   just go talk to her now and give her a good reason.. or you dont feel comfortable to go out with her alone..<br>  Good luck!!|`|vlnZXGu9aa	Explain just cause you don't like her like that there must bemore than one person who does, tell her someone else in your shcool probably likes her too. Explain you weren't trying to make her feel bad but you didn't want to lie to her|`|ih1JD5xYaa	Just tell her that its not her its you thats not ready for dating or whatever|`|POHWTDPRaa	Nothing. If you try and fix it that will just make her feel bad all over again. Next time you turn someone down, make sure you do it as nicely as possible.|`|ZMDECUhSaa	Well, if your feeling guilt and feel sad ask the girl to be your friend on myspace or facebook or something in real life. Try to hang out with her and reassure her that their are a lot of other boys. There is another side to this. If your feeling guilt you might have feelings for this girl. You just have to look in your heart.<br>  <br>  XOXO,<br>  Lissie
nM4kwOWsaa	well what are the three? so we have ideas?|`|vmoqPUhKaa	YEAH,<br>  1. Do you like me or the other girl you are with?<br>  2. Will you be faithful to me and drop the other girl?<br>  3. Will you cheat on me like you are cheating on her?<br>  4.  Have you lost your freaking mind and why are you trying to date two women at one when it seems you can't hanlde one?<br>  And to you Beach Baby why are you trying to break up two people that like each other?  You are surely a sweet peach and homewrecker for doing this.
ML4oQ8tuaa	well sounding from what youv said, id say his cousin is giving you insight that he does like you and that you really should ask him out if you feel the same way.<br>  i wouldnt hold back too much longer because time can make things change. Just go for it and dont look back<br>  Good Luck|`|UCdqF7Psaa	hmmm, well, maybe go up to him and say, <br>  <br>  you<br>  "what are you doing this weekend?"<br>  him<br>  "nothing much"<br>  (you hope he isn't busy.)<br>  you<br>  oh sweet, want to catch a movie?<br>  <br>  and really just take it from there or,<br>  or maybe be like, <br>  <br>  you<br>  "do you think going out would wreck our relationship? <br>  or<br>  "what would you say if I asked you out?<br>  <br>  good luck !! : )<br>  <br>  I hope I helped,|`|B1COLthhaa	just casually ask him to hang out, be like..."OMG there's this awesome movie i really wanna go see!! did you wanna go with me?"|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Get Your Freinds To Help . Peace Dude|`|t1ecTYWRaa	Maybe start off with joking around with him or just start a lil convo!|`|yZLiLUxOaa	He probably does. He probably got the cousin to ask you for him. You should go up to him and hint around and if it feels right ask him.|`|hAz30eGVaa	Cousin knows best! Go for it!|`|yyIVrngcaa	please, don't ask him to be your boyfriend. Nothing makes a girl look more desperate...wait it out and let him ask you! if he likes you like you say he does he should come to you.

IxzJ6SN5aa	I've found a lot of people tend to lie including me from time to time. It comes from not thinking before they speak.<br>  <br>  Its best when you recognize this trait in someone to point it out. Its good to curb bad habits before they become chronic.|`|6c02d02bf857232422a679628b4b9402aa	Yes. They practiced lying to their mothers and it continues|`|aeLyiRczaa	Well, sadly I think that is true to a point.  And it is wrong of them.  But I do offer this if you gals will be honest.  Most of you women insist upon being lied to for the most part.  You cannot deal with the truth.<br>  <br>  A man walks into a bar and just tells you he wants to lay you.  You get mad, indignant and toss a drink in his face.<br>  <br>  A man walks into a bar, buys your drinks and lies his *** off to you. You buy it hook line and sinker, all while you know he is lying.  Then you sleep with him.<br>  <br>  Women have to play the victim and act as if they were wronged instead of just admitting they wanted to get laid that night too.  You have to act as if someone else did wrong to keep from facing the truth about yourselves.  So, men learned how you are and have acted accordingly.<br>  <br>  Come on lady.  Men do not have a lock on lying.  Women are masters at lying to themselves, lying to others and living devoid of reality or fact.|`|chlvKoXqaa	i believe my husband lies about almost everything<br>  debra's right,
ChmuSKpVaa	eyes, body, good attitude, funny, and really nice, but still have a touch of trouble maker in him! lol...hope i answered good.|`|XatJJQ6Yaa	there are other questions that have been answered that are just like this, and every persons answer is going to be different.
0368f22451a1cbd1a5c4bfbfd11e0ecfaa	There is no MUST. Some people do a "tea & cakes reception" and opt for no dancing at all.  If you DO do dancing, then the common dances are:<br>  First Dance (each other)<br>  Mother/ Son (sometimes this is ONLY groom and his mother, other times this is groom and his mother, bride and groom's father - it keeps both members of that party involved)<br>  Father/Daughter (again, sometimes this is ONLY bride and her father, other times this is bride and her father, groom and bride's mother - it keeps both members of that party involved)<br>  Then of course there is wedding party dance (this is generally the groom and the Maid of Honor as well as the Bride and the Best Man - all at once OR the best man and the maid of honor and the rest of your wedding party paired off (usually in the order they walked back up the aisle). <br>  For most people all this is just TOO MUCH... nobody wants to sit through 30 dances they aren't involved in, nor do they wish to watch the wedding party "put on a show".  For the sake of your families and friends, try to keep it to 3 exclusive dances or less.  Even better though, is to keep it to one or two songs by following the "layout" of the answerer above. She has been apparently been to weddings that were planned out very intelligently!|`|N8qypuP7aa	I'm dancing with my hubby.. my dad.. his dad and probably both our moms and probably his 2 brothers and my 2 brothers! Good luck and congrats!|`|SIp2QgiWaa	If they choose not to it's ok. I know when i was at a wedding everyone lined up with money in their hands to dance with the groom and bride.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	sometimes the bride dances with her dad and the groom dances with his mom.  usually like halfway through the bride & groom's first dance together by themselves, the DJ asks the wedding party to join them so the bridesmaids and groomsmen pair up.|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	At my wedding (8/28/07) we had the first dance and I danced with my dad (My Little Girl by Tim McGraw). My hubby's mom passed away six weeks before we got married and we played her favorite song "Kiss An Angel Good Morning" in memory of her.|`|6701f7106e5be82f05306047c5a9c5e8aa	Traditionally, the bride and groom will be the first to dance as their special song is played softly. Lights dimmed low create a romantic atmosphere.<br>  <br>  As the music continues to play, the father of the bride will cut in on the groom and dance with his daughter. The groom asks the bride's mother to join him in a dance and together they grace the dance floor.<br>  <br>  The groom's father then cuts in on the bride's father and dances with the bride himself.  The bride's father will then cut in on the groom and dance with his wife.<br>  <br>  The groom will then ask his mother to dance.  Following this, the parents exchange dances with the other couple.  <br>  <br>  The best man then comes out to ask the bride to dance and the groom will dance with the maid or matron of honor.  Finally, the entire wedding party, ushers and bridesmaids join in the festivities.  Once the entire bridal party and their parents are on the dance floor, the other guests are invited to dance.  <br>  <br>  The "money dance" originated as a custom in Poland, and is a popular tradition found celebrated in the weddings of today.  It takes place sometime after the first dance and is usually announced by the DJ.  It is customary for the best man to begin dancing with the bride, pinning money onto her gown or putting it into a satin bag carried by the bride, especially for the money dance.  A newer rendition of this money dance includes bridesmaids and other ladies dancing with the groom, pinning money on his lapel.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Well, at the one reception I've been to, people paid a dollar to dance part of a dance with the Bride and Groom. It got them some extra money and time to say hello to their families and what not. Other than that, I would think that the whole bride and her dad and groom and his mom thing is traditional.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Each other, and the opposite-sex parent, and the opposite-sex  in-law,are the three musts.<br>  <br>  But they should dance with as many people as possible, for example, grandparents, close uncles/aunts, guests from out of state, etc.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	They only do the mother/son daughter/father dance.They dont need to dance with anyone else.
TPZZESeeaa	kiss him the way you want to be kissed. or say hey, kiss me like this and show him. case closed|`|177b82427498ae7807cb61bc6d21d5e7aa	You will have to tell him, but be careful, he maybe does not he's doing it.He gets too exited he's producing to much saliva.|`|v398Qalyaa	ughy, yes, i've had boyfriends like that, it's really off putting, just say can i have a dry kiss as i keep getting chapped lips!!|`|1CgCx1E2aa	see when he is slimy and when he's not slimy-- go for it kiss him. you can also tell him he is your boyfriend|`|ojiO3svoaa	what the first girl said|`|QS3PtXg8aa	tell him! he`ll feel stupid at first but say its ok,just less slobber!|`|B1COLthhaa	maybe he's inexperienced...that could be the case, tell him in a nice way about it. a nice way would be something along these lines: wipe ur mouth with your fingertips and say "oh boy, haha i'm all wet" men like sexual references and it'll also make him realize that you don't like being all wet|`|nXzvE0P8aa	LOL!!!   When you and him are kissing tell him to not kiss you back and you do all the kissing how you like it then just tell him to try that and if he askes why tell him it just feels sweet when he kissess you slowly.... Some guys just need a little direction|`|yyIVrngcaa	Haha! oh man...thats better than smelly breath kisses! Of course, I have no problem with being honest about anything when it comes to what I want in a relationship..especially kisses and affection. You should try it :)|`|ik9hP6FBaa	oh yum, well i think that you should start out slow and then heat it up a bit, but dont go to fast cuz that is when alot of siliva comes out! soo watch out :)|`|YTHmYqllaa	kiss another girl in front of him, and tell him to do what you do.<br>  he get a show and an education|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Tell him to follow your lead and show him how you want to be kissed.|`|vrsMTzNYaa	teach him how to kiss right, tell him what you don't like and show him ;)|`|PJec1EfGaa	uhh tell him. but let him down easily, dont be so harsh|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	You can tell him that you prefer more lip than tongue and try to get him to change. However, I think that kissing styles are very personal and its tough to take criticism. Believe it or not, this is one of those things that will forever bother you no matter what stage of the relationship you are in so tread carefully when you bring it up.|`|7b5i9TG2aa	lol yeah thats gonna happen my boyfriend does that too lol<br>  sometimes you should just stick with closed lip kissing your mouth might be too tiny for his thats why it seems like he is devouring your face lol<br>  thats how i felt when my boyfriend kissed me  or just tell him not to open his mouth soo wide  !!<br>  as for your man he'sprobubly isent much of an exsperienced kisser its verry common teach him some thing lol =D|`|BiXBWADmaa	tell him like play 20 questions with him its the only way he will catch on then after that just work on it with him|`|cG8cuq9Yaa	sounds more like ur kissing a puppy.

kvmWDuOJaa	It was his fault for taking it the wrong way! Don't worry about it, it will work out fine.<br>  <br>  If you do get the job, just use your body language to show that you aren't interested.<br>  Also if you're working with him, you're likely to become friends. Just casually bring your boyfriend up in conversation (do it as many times as it takes for him to get the picture!)<br>  <br>  You barely know the guy, and if you do get to know him he will soon realise that you're not interested, so really don't worry about it!<br>  I hope you get the job :) !<br>  <br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link? It would mean an awful lot to me :')<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  Thanks so much.|`|zscuDpaIaa	omg i know exactly how you feel. There was this guy when i started my new job who used to always be all flirty and talk to me all the time.... then the subject about my b.f came up and hes still flirty with me.... What you said is fine, he probably just thinks your cute lol. Your deffinatly not cheating on your boyfriend, yes i think your chances are pretty good!|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	well if you get the job dont take it just fine another one cuz things could go wrong even if you dont want to be with the guy say if they hire you then he'll probably come on too you <br>  so i just say stay away|`|1JsWMX0daa	It will be OK. i think you just blew a lot of air into his ego balloon. that's all. if you get the job than just go 2 work & do what you gotta do. next time though, guys think comments like that are very flirty. think about if a guy was talking to you and said you looked like his ex, or whatever.|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Lol|`|yyIVrngcaa	Haha...relax, I doubt even if you got hired he'd make any moves on you...if he tries to get too personal just let him know you have a bf and aren't interested in developing a more personal relationship with him. He's an older man, he should understand.<br>  If he took it another way it's probably because you complemented in a flirty way, there's different tones used when complementing someone that show different meanings behind what is said.<br>  but lol, if you complemented only to get the job.<br>  good luck*|`|uQlD1Zffaa	Good chance you will get the job, the only thing you can do now is not flirt back. Just be friendly though, don't act like a ***** if he compliments you or something. A friend of mine has a guy at work  who thinks that they will get married one day, just let is slide off you without much of a reaction and things should be fine. Good luck!|`|745966f59f25a953659cbe30cf713bc4aa	Well Honey, I do think that if he likes you that might work in your advantage. But at the same time, that guy might expect some other things from you then you doing a good job. So the best thing to do is to (in my opinion) look for another job.|`|B1COLthhaa	nooo, maybe that's his personality ya know? don't take it personally, maybe if you didn't ask that question he still would've acted like that toward you....don't stress over it gurlie =]|`|SJhbtFMyaa	That is so  funny! Just get hired and if he continues to act like that tell him to stop. He cant fire you for that.

You did nothing bad. Absolutely. Just said your opinion.<br>  Your chances are now maybe even bigger, but surely not smaller.<br>  If you see him doin' or trying anything that you're uncomfortable with, just say it to him. But do it straight, without letting him any doubts.<br>  <br>  Peace from Serbia.
1zpwabI9aa	it means its time to dump him and find someone who thinks you're beautiful|`|8j7FCEOraa	It was your dumb idea to ask him, what were you thinking? You should be happy he was being honest, you shouldn't of asked if you didn't want him too!|`|7fXpLlhBaa	Your boy committed a major NO-NO. Wow, you've got bricks for a boyfriend so I would dump him, AND fast. You just don't say that to anyone, especially not to your significant other. Case closed.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	damn, thats pretty harsh. Most guys lie. Cause in the end we all arent going to pretty when we get old and wrinkled. i would have lied, cant tell you how many girlfriend ive had who werent pretty.|`|AA10415165	So, you were doing what all girls do, and you wanted him to lie when you asked him that? So confusing.|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	Value truth over pretty words.  Do you really want to train him to lie?<br>  <br>  If he's there, he loves you.|`|tae4IGumaa	it means he doesnt think your pretty but he doesnt think your ugly|`|CzS1EiV9aa	I love this:<br>  <br>  attractiver...<br>  <br>  If you already have him, then ask him his preference.  If he is with you, then you are attractive enough.  You can also surprise him with different looks to check his reaction.  I used to date this girl that was in beauty school, and since they were short on people to practice on they used each other.  She had a different look every week and it was great.|`|lry4ncIBaa	if hes your boyfriend he should hav said something like <br>  'in my eyes your beautiful, so who cares what anyone else thinks' <br>  <br>  it would hav hurt me 2! dont dwell on it too much, some guys just dont realise that girls hav more feelings - emotionally, and it could hurt you. <br>  <br>  lets face it, least he was honest, good luck with everything! x x|`|AA10997134	he si your bf he should think u are beautiful, i guess he was honest atleast but really if he doesnt find u attractive then why is he with u.

It means you should leave him! A real man should think his woman is beautiful!|`|Lxd7jaASaa	it might just be who he is. he is obviously attracted to you because he is with you. but i have been in a similar situation. i had been hooking up with this guy i had really liked and he would never call me prett yor anything, never give me any compliments. and so one day i was like, "why dont you ever compliment me? guys are supposed to tell the girl how attractive she is" and he was like, "i mean, youre just mediocre, but youre so cute". Every guy has a different personality trait, and every guy will treat a girl differently. i dont think you should leave him if you really like him. if he shows signs of really liking you, you should stay with him. He might not have know what to say, and didnt want to sound all cheesy and mushy, either, like maybe he didn twant to say "youre beautiful babyyy". some guys just arent like that.<br>  <br>  sorry this is so long, but i completely understand how youre feeling. hope i helped!|`|AA12216204	It most likely means you are average.  That isn't a bad thing either.  The main thing is you stay true to yourself.  You have a boyfriend, he must like you for who you are so don't worry about it.  Unless, of course, he is a jerk and telling you that to make you feel bad on purpose.<br>  Besides, being pretty is a relative thing,  You may be average looking to one and pretty to another.|`|rCNRcF5waa	It means it's time for you to find a new boyfriend.<br>  Sorry. But it's the truth. Your guy needs to find you attractive in order for it to work. Even if he said "you're not ugly, but you're not pretty." Meaning there are girls he thinks are pretty. What makes you think your relationship is safe with a guy who obviously likes other women? Don't change yourself for a guy. Ever. You'll find one who does think you're pretty. And someday you'll find a guy who won't even think of looking at other women.|`|xG2bbN0haa	Depends on how you define pretty. If he was thinking supermodels are pretty, and you are average, then that is okay. If he was thinking well I am not that into you, but I was lonely, so your not pretty, but... Then definitely drop him. Best advice: Tell him that his comment hurt your feelings and see how he responds. If he tries to blem you, it is definitely time to let go.|`|fgxrdj21aa	don't dump the guy, thats a little harsh. yeah he said the wrong thing, by accident or not, but he has his own oppinion (although in this case he shouldn't >.>) think of it this way: if he doesn't think you're pretty, and hes still with you, it shows he can see past your looks and see who you are - thats somthing not alot of people can do.|`|arL5yByKaa	well first off you dont need to change for anyone. if he really likes you he should love you for who you are. buhh if you want to look more "attractive" then heres some tipss...<br>  [1] try straghteninq your hair <br>  [2] wear eyeliner,eyeshadow,and mascara<br>  [3] look for staright leg jeans and a tightishh tee shirt with a matching zip up.<br>  [3] get nikes,osiris's,jordans,boots,flats ect. --->> wat ever your into <br>  -->> hope this helps.! :]|`|95gVLrIGaa	It means you're average. He probably could have said it nicer, but at least he was honest.<br>  <br>  Find someone that likes you for you. Don't do what most other girls do and find someone that tells them whatever they want to hear whether or not it's the truth.|`|LxZFioqwaa	I'm glad your boyfriend said this, it proves he isn't shallow, you just be happy about his honesty, I know its nice to be complimented but you have a boyfriend who cares not for your looks and really loves you.|`|0deO62tvaa	f*ck him..find a guy who deserves you and thinks you are beautiful inside and out<br>  <br>  you don't need that **** from your own bf<br>  <br>  and you shouldn't have to ask him if you are pretty he should have been telling you that from the beginning :)|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	I guess that means your in between pretty and ugly. And as for your look you could be pretty if you fixed your hair and put on some make-up, but not a whole lot and see what happens.|`|xBeNsFWBaa	grow out your hair, straighten it, guys hate tomboys so kinda where bright colors, put some eyelinder and lip gloss on, show cleavage guys love it|`|yelqyRLIaa	well maybe if you are a tomboy then you should be more girly<br>  tell him that what he said hurt you|`|z6DIHEG3aa	bad news and good news sweetie, bad news is he obviously does think yo *** is fugly, but on the bright side he cares or he wouldn't be dating you if you were that ugly so smiles hoe|`|AA10928214	it means he's kind of a jerk. Like yeah he should be honest, but why don't you find a guy who thinks your HOT just the way you are?|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	IT means he should not be your boyfriend anymore.|`|srfZDygNaa	wow. <br>  wow<br>  wow.<br>  he is an a s s h o l e<br>  dump him immediately by saying "whoa, i am wayyyy to good for you."
M0eW1OxOaa	I presume it means youre not a girly girl and not a full on tom-boy either. However, if a guy doesnt say you are pretty to him then theres something wrong. Go get yourself someone who DOES think youre pretty and not just not ugly
VEEgoDkFaa	Just because he doesn't tell you you're pretty doesn't mean he doesn't feel or think you are.  Some guys aren't good at giving out compliments. He obviously likes you or he wouldn't be your boyfriend. As for how you look, well, you're going to change a lot over the years and you'll learn to dress up and look nice when you need to.  So don't sweat it.  Trust. ';-)|`|RarSAK4Haa	you just asked this question 20 mins ago|`|1ac7ff377a38a39ef6014d3e31201dd7aa	you don't have to start wearing makeup, but capitalize on what you have got. you are an early bloomer, I'm not saying to wear a tube top, but maybe get your hair nice and styled, and maybe got somewhere between hiding your chest and tube top.|`|74gPuaXMaa	If this is the case, sounds like you guys are really young. I'm going to guess 8th grade? Anyways, he is probably inexperienced with have a serious relationship, so he might be bad at complimenting.|`|AA10778911	hes calling you average|`|qxxK7w0taa	Well, i wouldnt saya he thinks your ugly. He probably just wishes sthat you would  sometimes fix your self up.  Like mabey wear your  hair down one day or even scrunch you hair to make e it have waves.  Just something new. Instead of the same thing  everyday. And looks shouldnt  matter  i agree. As for make up..Its up to you. Since it sounds like your a little young wear  light colors. Like light browns..A more natural look. <br>  Good  luck. And good  perfume is  good also. =)|`|AA12094570	Has he ever actually said that he doesn't think you're pretty, or are you just assuming this because he doesn't tell you it? Ask him about it, like, seriously, and see what he says. Even if he has said it, ask him like why and stuff, and tell him its bothering you.|`|iuogMRfXaa	well you should prob start wearin makeup and i think he likes you u. anyways good luck

My auntie shouted at us to come downstairs and as we came down she said "its nearly time to count down new year" we went into the front room and saw evryone grabbing party poppers and we joined them. then the countdown started 10..9....8...7...6...5....4...3...2...1.... NEW YEAR! evryone shouted. He looked at me and said happy new year then gave me a little kiss on the lips.<br>  <br>  2) I started going out with a boy i hardly knew when i started high school but it went well anyway. he invited me to go swimming so i did so and while we was in the pool splashing around and messing about he asked to go in the shallow end so we could practise handstands. all of a sudden he asked if i could kiss underwater. i said i dont know but i can try and took a deep breath and went underwater for a bubbly kiss. it was fun.<br>  <br>  3) i was going out with this boy for agess but we never got any privert time until one night we were sitting on my bed watching 'shes the man' lol and we put our faces really close together and just stared into each others eyes then i said look down and he did and then leaned in and started kissing me i was quite shocked at first but enjoyed it. it lasted what seemed like a long time but was proberly only a few seconds or a minuet but it was tounges and was the best kiss of my life :P <br>  <br>  Hope you enjoyed stories...now a few tips <br>  <br>  1) when going in for a kiss once lips are touching, close your eyes. you may find this comes natural it does for me :D<br>  <br>  2) dont take a deep breath before kissing and dont suck the air out of the person ou are kissing. try to breath through your nose<br>  <br>  3) good breth is assensial. have a mint if you think your going to get lucky or chew gum but spit it out before kissing<br>  <br>  4) dont have anthing in your mouth<br>  <br>  5) lick your lips lightly before if you get a chance because it makes it a lot easier and nicer<br>  <br>  6) enjoy it!<br>  <br>  hope this helps i spent a lot of time typing this all out and am not a very fast typer so hope its worth it :D <br>  <br>  best of luck xx|`|62577f8890a63367299c541234ce9886aa	Best Kissing Books:<br>  <br>  - Any Meg Cabot Book (especially Queen of Babble Series)<br>  - Twilight Series<br>  - If you're a big reader...

I did it about two more times. than the next time i put my lips to hers i kept them there and she opened her mouth. we kissed open mouth for just a couple or few seconds. i could'nt wait and i quickly put my tongue in her mouth and we swirled our tongues around each other. than we flicked our tongues together. we kept going back and forth between the swirling and flicking. she stopped to catch her breath. i gave her a second and than started kissing her on her neck and cheeks. i liked her neck very softly too with my tongue. than we made out again untill she needed another breather. i couldn't get enough of her. and i thought she was so pretty. we made out for hours, it was only one night but we spent a long time together and it felt like forever and i loved every second of it. that was the best hook up i ever had and i will never forget it.

I would be freakin if my boyfriend had alot of girl friends and talked to them on the phone and even hung out with them. He even tells you he has to go on the phone to talk to her! Wow that to me is a pretty whacked out relationship you have goin with him. Plus you say he hooked up with her before if you say you have trust issues, I'd get out now I mean you say you have invested alot of yourself in him. But if you have trust issues you may want to find someone who doesn't have alot of girlfriends and would rather spend more time talking to you his own girlfriend then other girls he's hooked up with in the past!|`|LAYJxqrHaa	well maybe you can confront him to see if he is cheating or something or tell her that if she dont lay off your man you would beat her up, that'll teach her to mess with you. unless your friends with the girl have a talk with her. from there i dont really know what to tell you.<br>                                                                                         Peace|`|aGx4gzDfaa	You should really confront him about it or it will just keep annoying you. But don't get to serious about it if he doesn't think it is a big deal he might not think it's annoying you. Just gradually bring up the subject... like it's nothing.  You have a good reason to be annoyed about it. Trust me you need to do something about it if it annoys youand don't just assumes he doesn't like you any more. This could be the case but just don't think of it like that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	The truth is, he still has a lot of feelings for this other girl. He cares a lot for you, but isn't sure how to break it off. He wanted you to get upset when he told you about their relationship in hopes you would break it off. That way he does not have to feel bad for what he is doing.

They will hit on him because he is high ranking, and also because he is smoking hot.  When I go see him at work, he will show me which of the new girls has hit on him, and we will laugh together over it.  Some of them are very pretty, but he says he hasn't met one yet that he would want to ruin his marriage over.  I like to joke with him that he is waiting for "the one".<br>  Oh yeah, he is 35 and we have been married for 12 years.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	No. swoosh|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	NO WAY.<br>  <br>  When I am married I am totally monogamous.<br>  <br>  When I am single I am wild, give her my email (ha)|`|bqkfu6Diaa	No. I'm sure I do have a chance with a "hot,fresh 19 year old".

The world is filled with poontang that is just waiting for a guy like me to scoop up and enjoy.<br>  <br>  But I got married, which means I decided to not do that anymore. How is it that marriage vows only mean something if she is watching? That's lame. If you make a commitment, you should stick to it even if no one is watching and no one will ever find out. Otherwise you're just adding more lies to this world.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	No I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  When I promised to forsake all others I meant it, there is more to life than sex.

YOU know. And if you're even considering such a thing, you obviously don't take your marriage that seriously.<br>  <br>  Even if no one else ever finds out, you're degrading the marriage on your end, and taking something beautiful from your wife - fidelity.<br>  <br>  Be a man, and be faithful. Try spicing things up with your spouse, she's probably a lot more open to the idea then you think.|`|mRffo5G8aa	I have done just that, but it was a 27 year old.

41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	It's simple, he plays a tune and you dance to it. He treats you like a doormat, you say you love him.<br>  <br>   He doesn't really care about you, he treats you like dirt but you come back for more.<br>  <br>   He treats you this way because YOU let him!<br>  <br>   Have some self-respect, say goodbye to the abuse and dump him.|`|25VsqqA4aa	Well, just ask him if he still wants you!|`|9QyrW2iCaa	see Dave's answer.|`|ZdXXa1AKaa	you need to talk to him and tell him how you feel he'll never know whats the matter if you don't talk to him.

I8H3PZ4Jaa	if you flirt with some guys theres a good chance you will but only if you flirt like you have to try and talk to guys. thats what happened i hooked up wit 2 guys older then me on a cruise last year and i was 14 they were 16 and the other was 17.|`|8j7FCEOraa	You want to hook up?<br>  Your 15, your just a baby<br>  You shouldn't be hooking up with anyone<br>  Keep it in your pants until your old enough to deal with the potential consequences.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	If I was your dad I would be very concerned right now, what is he thinking letting you go on a cruise with these girls!|`|piqkAV1Xaa	Omg, ! That is aweesome, cruises's are soo romantic and fun, I saw a cutee guy that became friedns with my brotherr; i wanted to hookup with him , but i was too shy to say anything/do anything, so if u see someonee you want to hook up , dont be scared to make the first move!<br>  It's pretty easy as long as your outgoing, good luck ;)|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	I'm sure it be like hooking up in Vegas you know hanging out with them while you are there. And see what happens when it is over, Oh I'm sure you will find someone it's all about competition
CoEGQxN6aa	Your in his comfort zone.  He may not see you as anything more than just a friend.  He has a great deal of respect for you which is good.  The best thing to do is to be honest with him because sometimes guys need to hear the truth about how you feel...you never know he may like you just as much but is afraid to make the first step because he doesn't know how you'll react or possibly lose your friendship. Guys are basic creatures...what they say and do they mean it...Good Luck|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well there may be two reasons why he gotten back with his ex. <br>  1.) He is trying to make you jealous, or want him more.<br>  2.) He doesn't have feelings for you.<br>  <br>  Their relationship may not last because they broke up in the first place. You should tell him how you feel about him, flirting may make it seem like you guys are having fun. When he breaks up with the gf or even during they are together may make him think twice and they may break up.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	! im not a guy ! but i have the same problem girl!<br>  so no worrys... just walk up to him tomarro and say hi.<br>  let the conversation continue a while. then be like i like you.<br>  if he doesnt like you the way you like him MOVE ONN(:<br>  gl
Uj5kuzoJaa	The brain is active as in still moving and precessing things, but you are long gone by then. It's like when you turn some machines off. You might still hear them humming for a few minutes even though they are turned off. No you aren't aware of anything once you're gone|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	It depends on how you died. If you get shot in the head, obviously there isn't going to be any brain activity. If your head gets cut off, it takes just a matter of seconds for the blood to drain out of the skull and you die pretty fast - but for those few seconds, technically your brain is still active.<br>  <br>  If you're declared "dead", then you have no brain activity and no heart beat either.<br>  <br>  But when a person is dying, again it depends how, the brain can pass through many different stages of awareness. At the moment of death, the brain fires wildly, in an attempt to jump start the body and keep itself alive. But this is why when people who have near death experiences say they see things ranging from deceased relatives, to heavenly or hellish images.<br>  <br>  You certainly would not have brain activity while you were being buried, if you were totally dead. So you would not be aware of the fact that you were being buried.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Your BF is 'dead' wrong. No, that is not true at all.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	No - brain activity is the key reason your body passes. With brain activity, your heart would continue to pump and body still react. Unfortunately, the brain is required to keep breathing and heart pumping. <br>  <br>  Even if it were true, most people are embalmed before being buried. In that process, your brain would be automatically shut down due to the chemicals inserted into your bloodstream.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	No, it isn't true. The official recognition of death is lack of brain activity. You aren't declared dead unless your brain is dead.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I've never heard that. Not much you can do if its true either.|`|xD8T4dY3aa	Well, define 'working'. Electrical impulses are still present when a person dies (heart and respiratory processes cease). This does not indicate that a person's brain is working as in life and thinking rationally as these are only residual impulses.<br>  These impulses vanish quickly after death and are definitely not present during burial.<br>  There has been research into the impulses and there has been conjecture that extremely low impulses may still be present after the accepted limit.<br>  The further ideas that hair and nails grow when a human being is buried are also inaccurate. This phenomenon is only the skin's dehydration and the hairs are more exposed the further the skin recedes giving that impression. Same with the nails.|`|LlkdoZTeaa	your boyfriend is correctin what he is saying, but the activity in the brain is merely static and the last of the nervous system dying off,<br>  <br>  and no it isnt the case of you know whats happening as you brain is so to speak ''dead'' <br>  <br>  just as its true, a dead body will still fart for a day or so at most, and twitch because there is still slight activity in your nervous system after death but this does not mean you are in anyway concious, you would need a pulse to know what was happening.<br>  <br>  and also finger / toe nails continue to grow for a period of time after death|`|95gVLrIGaa	It depends on how you die. You'll lose consciousness before you die. Once you're dead you won't know that you're dead or being buried.<br>  <br>  There have been historic documents that showed experiments with people that were beheaded with a guillotine. After the head fell into the basket, they would call out the person's name and sometimes they would get a response (eyes opening or eye contact). There was one instance where the "head" opened its eyes at least 3 times after his name was called. But this obviously didn't last longer than a minute or so. Pretty morbid, eh?|`|ac3HAiOKaa	You're brain can go for a couple minutes after you stop breathing, and only seconds after you're heart stops beating but you're not technically dead until you're brain stops working... and it would never last long enough for you to get burried|`|74gPuaXMaa	Your bf is full of crap. lol<br>  When you die, everything stops. <br>  In a coma, your brain still works, but you're just not conscious.|`|9087cfc4b56c3a084319c372d96dcc79aa	your boyfriend is one word.... RETARDED!!|`|DXvsemWtaa	all i've heard is that you poop when you die.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	HE IS PULLING YOUR LEG!!! dont fall for that.. how can he know.. better yet ask him how many times has he died himself to know for sure what he is telling u...|`|CfXCEmpEaa	Ten minutes give or take. You are not dead or declared dead until your brain is fully dead. Your brain can survive about 10 minutes without oxygen before complete death. If someone hooks you up to a brainwave monitor you will not be declared dead until that monitor flatlines. Hope this helps.|`|giQ8Vgeaaa	Once your body shuts down the brain goes with it too. The brain lives on oxygen in the body.|`|VHPfPwSraa	Your brain rots, as soon as your brain starts lacking oxygen.

hjS7HA7daa	Your not ugly, but you shouldn't ask this question, what do a couple of freaks of y/h know? Your an average looking girl, most of your photos are blurry and you've just captured the top of your face. Try taking clear photos and don't ask Y/h coz they won't tell you what you want to hear. Your not ugly, no one is
AA11333402	once you decide to lose it, you can never regain it.  make it special|`|ON84EQaBaa	Now days if you're 19 & still a virgin I think you should wait until you are married! good luck|`|qlCwiXpyaa	stay virgin. your husband will appreciate you later on. when yall do decide to get married and be commited to each other. thats what im doing!|`|52383a5b2697c2e9ecf62a6ab9fd4c1faa	I agree with kbmoose1. That's the perfect answer.
L3g41cpKaa	I think he's afraid of admitting he likes you, and him talking about all these other girls is just trying not to face the truth and his feelings.|`|sriByWZBaa	hm, well it sounds to me that this guy be like he hates you, but not literally. I mean, if he still texts you and stuff then I don't think he hates you. Maybe he has different feelings toward different people. Maybe he treats other girls the same and you differently. Perhaps he likes you, just in a different approach than most boys would say. Better ask him why he keeps telling you that he hates you.|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	My sister always told this guy that she hated him when they were dating she was just kidding though.  I always wondered what they said to each other when the eventually broke up.  Did they say 'I love you' angrily as they passed each other in the hall?  Anyway he just is kidding with you and he probably really likes you.  He is just afraid to show it.
CfXCEmpEaa	Well, honestly, it all depends on this boys personality, <br>  if he's a nicer guy, he might be flattered but not know how to talk to you.<br>  If he's more of a player, he might take advantage of it.<br>  If he doesn't... like you, you might get nothing, brace yourself for anything =)|`|Co7BtKiPaa	it will make him more inclined to flirt with you and make the first move because he has more confidence c(;|`|dfRu4G1gaa	the most boys just hope you make the first move then.....|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	It gives him a reason to either ask you out if he is into you or it gives him a outlet to give you mixed messages and jerk you around.  I would act like you don't care and see if he is a good guy that is really into you and not wanting to jerk you around...if that makes any sense?!<br>  <br>  Good luck and be a strong confident woman ...never pathetic :)|`|btA5ryMbaa	coming from a boy, its a good thing. its always good to know who likes you. if i found out that a girl liked me, i would think that it is really cool, and think about liking her.|`|gVMmdeLcaa	its a gd thing if he likes you... but a bad thing if he doesn't :)|`|6zfpexuIaa	i dont know|`|UIABnrM1aa	Well, if you act like you didnt know she told him, everything will be fine. Unless you want to know if he likes you, then ask that friend to text him and ask for you.(unles your okay with asking him yourself) Hope I helped!
XiOIBwbPaa	PERSONALITY: someone who is funny, (but not the kind who think there funny so they make a fool of themselves). able to have a serious talk without freaking out. Able to be there for me in my biggest times of need, is respectful to not only me but everyone. easy to get along with and doesn't ignore me if we are in a fight.<br>  <br>  PHYSICAL: doesn't really matter, but things that attract me are, eyes, smile, hair, nice bodies are nice but I don't care about them. and a lip piercing never hurt, as long as he looks good with it :)|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Well Jeff, from my past experiences I'm sure it was their personality because I don't judge people by the way they look on the outside.  I was raised well by my parents and was always encouraged to look for the good in a person before seeing the bad.  The old adage "Don't judge a book by it's cover" is the way we all should aspire to see the other person.  Too many people out there, both men and women, by-pass so many good people because they don't read the book...oh my the great things that they missed out on.  Good luck with your dilemma.
fuia2Z6Maa	call him and ask him out
XFZmAMOAaa	You need to get rid of the little boy loser while you can.|`|8j7FCEOraa	You break up with  him<br>  <br>  Your not his prisoner, stop letting yourself be one. <br>  <br>  Secondly, who cares what people think?<br>  <br>  If no one wants to know you because of a rumour then they aren't worth knowing anyways.|`|lIYKAvvRaa	Get out of the relationship NOW!

You can find someone SO much better.|`|U7VlmXfQaa	you need to telll someone you trust about his behavior.<br>  he is showing signs of potential abuse.<br>  you may not see it now cuz you love him but eventually he might star.<br>  dump him or get help!|`|piqkAV1Xaa	dump him<br>  ur family is the only people who say who u can talk 2.
w9L0ACypaa	Just keep avoiding him - he'll soon get the message.<br>  Or better still, if you're man enough, the next time he says something rude to someone or acts like an idiot just say to him something like 'why do you always act like an idiot?'  It'll give him a wake-up call, because he's probably behaving like that to try and impress people - he probably thinks it makes him look cool.  Once he realises that no-one thinks it's cool to behave like that he'll start to change.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Stick the nut on him lol|`|AA11011446	Just avoid and ignore him at all times - he'll soon get the message, jackass that he is.|`|Oif6WjA6aa	give him a good spanking, then he might behave|`|hjS7HA7daa	tell him to fk off
vFca55WIaa	Well, I was kinda the guy in your situation. me and this girl have been friends for years and I have liked her for years. but it turned out that she liked one of my really good friends. So she turned me down, but I stayed really good friends with her. when she broke up with her boyfirend I was there for her and all that stuff but I was too afraid to get to close to her again even though I like her alot and I still do. So I just slowly am trying to get over her by cutting off all connections, but I still do love her. I dont know if this will help any, but it sounded like my situation. So good luck.

Enjoy it!!|`|KVFYJrDJaa	Once or twice a week is not that often. There are some couples that do it 5+ times a day every day and more on the weekends. I'd take it as a good sign that he's being true to you. He sees you, he wants you, he has to have you - you're obviously doing something right. That's a pretty good indicator that he's not spending hs sexual energy somewhere else. I think you might be able to get away with talking him down to only once a week, but when a persons sex drive is ignored, they get the wandering eye.|`|a7VkyZLfaa	the age of 38 must be hot and active! Two times a week , this is nothing and not two much , I expect to do it everyday and sometimes several times a day and I am in my early thirties .take my advice and enjoy it and try to love sex and you will notice that your face and skin will look more beautiful after sex . Making love is the healing for everything , depression , flu , heart disease ....etc. did you know that ? dont complain of a god graise , some women are dying to know why their husband is not sleeping with them , or they get some every 2 months.|`|OGhWKEWoaa	You can never have enough!

Honestly.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Only you can answer that question. It seems like he's romancing you enough. Are you participating? Or are you what I like to call an "audience" wife. I can't and won't tell you how many times a week is ok, that's up to the two of you.

I would prefer to have it once a day......or at least 3 or 4 times a week.  Can I please borrow your husband when you aren't using him???  I think that'd work out for the both of us.   ^_^|`|cf2c7a928eb151f3dc7e67af8dc5ee43aa	It won't last. Just enjoy it while you have it.|`|5hxWSezPaa	One or two times a week is a lot?  Honey, pinch yourself to see if you are dreaming.  That's average or a bit below for a 41 year old man.  You<br>  should be delighted that he finds you attractive, pursues you and does not cheat.|`|7oDK0w7qaa	Once or twice a week is hardly a lot. If you do 'other things' then yes it would be sufficient. You both have to agree on what suits you + he should never 'demand' it.|`|UfRMJheeaa	You've been together for 7 years FFS..You cant be only discovering this mismatched sex drive now|`|NGKwsawdaa	You should be happy that he is demanding it from you, You should worry when he's doesn't ask you for sex anymore.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	There is nothing wrong with him wanting sex. If you enjoyed it as much as he did, perhaps you would want it just as often as he does. Since sex is a good thing with good benefits, try not to look at it as a problem or inconvenience. He is not wrong for wanting more sex, and you will not be able to make him want less. It would be a lot easier and more beneficial for you to work on how you could be willing to have more sex and enjoy it more.|`|K5SGG1QYaa	once or twice a week is a really normal, maybe even slightly low amount, if it was much less that that i would think you were having relationship problems. i don't think he has a super high sex drive i think yours is a bit low if you think thats way too much. its nothing to worry about, we're all different, and some people want more that others, just maybe try to enjoy sex more, make it how you like it, maybe with more romance, or more gentle, or whatever it is you like. the you won't feel 'demanded' of, you'll enjoy it and look forward to it too.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	If you feel like it's too much pressure then let him know it makes you uncomfortable|`|BL4PEjAWaa	3 times a week is what the pro's call normal.  Don't know where they get the info from though.  I would ask if he is stimulating you enough.  Not being rude just wondering.  Some women do not have a strong sexual drive and there is nothing wrong with that either. You need to open a line of communication with your hubby about this either way.<br>    <br>   Have a great life.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Once or Twice a week?? Sh** hun my husband wants it once or twice a DAY!!

I once had a boyfriend who was a very expert lover, and with me he could produce totally satisfying simultaneous climaxes three times a night. <br>  Didn't take long, either. <br>  I think your husband need to improve his technique so that you find his offers more tempting.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Once or twice a week is pretty normal I think.  Too much sex would be once or twice a day everyday!!! He is a pretty normal man and it's not outta the ordinary for a man to want it all the time that's just their testosterone working overtime!!|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	You  wrote once or twice a week. surely that amount of sex  isn't  too much, Perhaps you ought  to think yourself lucky that he wants to make love to you at all. If you read YA often enough you will see no end of posts about the  complete  lack of sexual interest from  their partners.|`|j2C4riJlaa	You lucky woman!<br>  <br>  Some woman are desprite to get their men going! <br>  <br>  Na, seriously, if your sex drive is not as high as your husband, you should talk to him and tell him that your drive isisnt as high as his and he shoud repect you.<br>  <br>  Just tell him how you feeel <br>  <br>  -Hope it all works out for you.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	once or twice a week and you think it's to much, I'm 28 and my normal sex life with my husband is 5 to 6 times a week sometimes we've did it twice in a day, now that's asking to much.

How would you feel if he didn't want to do it as much?|`|CugCzH9iaa	Men NEED sex every 48 hours or the get restless and aggrivated. Unfortunatly it IS nessesary for their health and well being. Twice a week is normal.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Jeez lady.  You have a wonderful husband who wants to have sex with you.  Life could be a whole lot worse.
VygBNA0Waa	to embarrassed to say yes he likes you<br>  ignore him and watch him try and talk to you and if you are alone at the time say wow i didn't think you would talk to me because im to ugly and see what he says|`|OP8sRCbTaa	He is a jackass. Find someone better.|`|67841ed5a773f905fb355783ad71eceaaa	Hum... maybe he was embarrassed by the question. Perhaps it would be better if you try looking back and flirting a bit. See what he does. If he continues to stare at you, well, maybe he does like you!<br>  Good luck!
7pwEy0p7aa	sounds really bad. the best thing to get over him is to realize it never could have been.sorry. also, try hanging out with friends or a guy to get your mind off of him. <br>  <br>  i have like one response, please answer <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah.Qe.SzcDNyIXW67fOE_tzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226131819AA9umku">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|1ac7ff377a38a39ef6014d3e31201dd7aa	The only way to find out if he likes someone else is to ask him out. I know freaky notion, the girl asking the guy out, but its not 1950 anymore, its okay, you can do it. <br>  And if he says that he is seeing somebody, it will sting at first, but give it a couple days and you won't even care that he is with somebody else.<br>  Just take a deep breath and go for it!|`|Jspao2siaa	Well firstly repect yourself and think to yourself why is he giving u the cold shoulder if he doesnt feel the same then fine..he sounds up himself that oh he cant even be friends with u?<br>  <br>  If I were u I would brush him off if he doesnt need u why think about him and mess yerself up? Not worth even being ur friend and drops u just because someone told him u like him sounds like a twirp next time u c him pretend u dont give a toss and flirt and sit with other boys..and ul soon be over him.<br>  <br>  Just think to yourself..he couldnt even mantain YOUR friendship?<br>  <br>  Let ur junior mate have him...LOSER.
Ry4r4ycwaa	if he has kissed before you can just folow his lead and do what he does<br>  otherwise, when your lips meet, open our mouth put your tongue in his mouth and explore his mouth with your tongue, tickle his tongue, or just play with his tongue with your tongue. its kinda fun and yes, just do what comes naturally trust me, i was scared at first, but it comes pretty easy|`|VxdKfSgHaa	I actually had the same problem but on my current boyfriends 2nd date we went to the movies and we both felt it was the right moment so I turned and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  He turned and we kissed(my first kiss) and I was thinking I wanted to and by that point it came naturally but I didn't start it he did|`|tatsP8tqaa	ok I know what you mean, I hate that response it bugs me.. but it's kinda true.... but all I can tell you is try not to bite, wear chap stick, if your worried about your kissing abilities focus on the kiss itself and have fun with it... watch movies with lots of kissing scences... idk you are on your own. <br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|2IYfATLAaa	ok so if you're trying to start it, like to move in, I SWEAR THIS WORKS! take his hand, bring it close to your eyes and bat your eyelashes on his skin... its called a butterfly kiss. smile, act cute and like ask him if it tickles or something. regardless of his answer start doing it on his cheek but keep holding hands... when you do it on his face slowly look up at him, don't move back and just look into his eyes. then just go in for it. once your lips meet, if his are opened, open yours a little bit. if his are closed (hes scared lol) keep yours closed and keep giving him pecks that are longer and longer and gradually open your mouth and he will too. once you get the tongues going its fun. what i do, which is fun is me and my boyfriend take turns putting our tongues in each others mouths and kind of suck on them (sorry if that's too graphic... but hey! you asked! lol). you could also try sucking on his lower lip. also put one hand around his waist and the other behind his head maybe even playing with his hair :) after your done be sure to smile and give a positive response so he doesn't feel like he did something wrong... you want the opposite so you can keep doing it (i.e. don't let go of his hand ; ] )<br>  <br>  <br>  but honestly it does come naturally. <3 have fun and don't forget to BREAAAAAAATHE!!!!!!!!|`|nNYBhelGaa	it will just come naturally<br>  lol

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	should not have put anything in her name, and now that they borrowed on it, it can be taken if someone doesn't pay. so u would own half and she would own the other unfortunately, and they can foreclose. u could offer to buy her out, because her name is on it. i would ask an attorney what u could do. should have kept it in your name only for awhile, like i did. and no one has to loose out if there is a divorce.|`|AA11982228	Sounds like with all the money at stake, it'd be worth the price of an hours worth of an attorney's time!  Wow, what a mess!  Good luck!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	OK you need a lawyer, fast.<br>  <br>  In your state, it is possible that the house can be sold to recoup the loss---so long as your son did not commit fraud, according to state law. If they borrowed against the home, you may be behind the banks in line---but you need good advice fast.|`|kho74FORaa	Interesting but not entirely unique. First, I assume that your son has a attorney, and am also assuming that he will be the respondent in the divorce proceedings, since you stated that divorce papers were served. Your son should immediately request through his attorney for a OSC (order to show cause) and have the Judge rule on this issue. The judge will do one of two things. He will order the motion to be set aside or he will make a tentative ruling so that parties being effective by this issue will not be burden by the divorce itself. Meaning, your share or equity portion will not take any more damage than has at present. Now, you, since you are the holder on the deed, should contact the institution that made the second on the loan and speak with them stating the facts as you know them at present. Do not wait until the court acts. Banks don't care about what will be done but was is done now. So, the bank will only act when the court instructs them to do so, if at all and you will be better off served if you talk directly now to the bank instead of waiting for a hopeful ruling from the court in the sometime distant future. (Courts have a tendency to drag things out due to case loads, attorney conflicts, et al). If your son does not have a attorney, he can act pro per in court. (representing himself) He can request a court to take action against the wife so that any monies held jointly be frozen and any monies she has maybe ruled as monies needed to pay current obligations held as common debt. Why your son deeded his portion back to you prior to the divorce hearing is a big issue and may backfire on him if the judge believes that your son did so to hide or deceive the court in  anyway as to common property. That is the big question and can be a real problem if ruled in favor of his wife. She could argue that she did not want to do anything regarding the property until such time the court ruled on your sons behavior. Anyway, just wanted to give you both sides of the possible scenario. Common property will be divide as the court rules as necessary and fair. The old 50/50 has been thrown out the window and the judge now is who says and who says only as to what goes to who. Be careful when asking the court to do anything on your behalf without having all your information to support same. Just don't overstate anything and most important, don't leave any facts out. All is not lost, and after rereading what I just wrote it sounds pretty scary, It really isn''t that scary. The court will do the right thing most the time provided that the information presented is true and that parties effected by the decision are best served. Good luck and make sure that your son obtains a GOOD ATTORNEY. There is a difference. Remember, someone always graduates at the bottom of the class as well as the top.

I've heard worse, you seem to be wondering what else there is that you lack that there is no connection with the right woman.  See that's the issue women can be GOOD but that doesn't make them RIGHT for you.  they can be good and unhappy, in other words good at work, school and play but horrible in relationship.

He's just lying because he knows that you dont like them. So here is what you do: talk to him, ask him if he is addicted to them or if its been more that just two times. If so, tell him how you feel. Then get him some help. If you want to be with him then you take some action and talk to a grown up about it. Cheesy I know, but it might help out. Also, dont start doing them just becuase he is. And if he continues to do this and lies or whatever. Then its time to end things.

uRCbwSIlaa	Don't give up just yet. You're not doing anything that blatantly shows that you feel for her as more than a friend. She might completely misunderstand your attention as being a best friend or someone she trusts. Put yourself out on the line and let her know that you want more than just to hang out as friends. <br>  <br>  If at that point, she still doesn't acknowledge you as anything more than that, then its time to pack your bags and find a new girl. :) <br>  <br>  There are so many options out there, give it your all for this girl, but if worst comes to worst, know that you've still got the whole world of girls ahead of you. :D|`|4LrOVUgnaa	move on... if she likes you she will come after you.  you wont get anything done the other way|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	You may want to check from any source if she is ok, this sounds like something may have happened...|`|QAEm0Yitaa	Mmkay. well maybe you shouldn't bother because when you find a girl that is talking to 3 other guys and you. she probably was leading every one of you on and just pick one of you and decided to drop the other guys. if i was you i would just move on to someone new who is single but wants a boyfriend and not talking to everyone else. if she starts to talk you again, don't bother because that's most likely the boy dumped her if she was dating someone. you don't want to be hurt.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think she realized that she has feelings for you more than just friendship and she is tryin to avoid getting hurt.. but there is also the possiblitly that she might be busy and havent been able to get in touch with you... till u know for sure u cant think much of it... i hope that it works for u two.. good luck|`|LR4zUwcwaa	awww well, just relax. act like it doesn't bother you until next week.<br>  <br>  when you see her at school, say hey if you two make eye contact. then drop it. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS CAREFULLY. remember, love is alllll in the game.<br>  <br>  the next day say hey again, maybe even a whatsup...if a conversation gets going, let it lead the way...don't just blatantly ask "why'd you stop ignoring me?!?!" you don't want to be clingy, your a guy. girls HATE that.<br>  <br>  <br>  and if her body language says she's not interested, it sucks and that hurts but you have to accept it. you don't want to be the annoying guy that couldn't get a clue. if she doesn't like you anymore, whatever you do DONT SHOW IT.<br>  as my friends and i say when we go through something like this, "fake it till you make it." eventually, things will get better.<br>  <br>  hope things work out for you....good luck!(:|`|9IanzxZ7aa	The best thing to do is to find her and demand an explanation. Maybe she was waiting for you to tell her you love her but you didn't and she decides to move on. Maybe she thinks you only like her as friend. Try finding her and just tell her you like as a girlfriend and boyfriend... Good luck.|`|xmvgKmy5aa	Well to me it sounds like you guys have a lot in common. She might not be answering your calls or texts cuz shes busy. I can tell that you REALLY like her and i think she may have feelings for you too. I think you should give it another go.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	it does take time to get over a breakup, especially if its the first breakup, and a first love. its a grief process, the first step towards healing is to accept it, and understand that this rejection has nothing at all to do with your self worth. meaning u can't blame it all on yourself. it does hurt to loose someone u loved, and still love. u also have to deal with it and not try to figure it out, because for some things there are no clear answers. during your life u will experience this again with someone else, its just the way life is. because u don't always find that special person right off the bat. and remember that things happen for a reason, and that we have no control over anyone but us. there will be lots of girls who come and go in your life, and its a learning process which makes u bale to handle life's disappointments better, if u don't take it too seriously. no one likes to loose someone, we would rather avoid all the pain involved when we get rejected, but we can't, because its part of life, sometimes things go well, and sometimes they don't. if we had nothing but good come to us, how could we ever appreciate it without knowing how it feels to have bad.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	I'd say if you go to an English class you might find someone there.|`|kej0H1AXaa	your spelling is like a BJ...it sucks|`|wJ0iLG0raa	give us details so that we can get a better idea of what to answer to.

You shouldn't let it bother you.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you should ask yourself a few practical issues which age may make a difference in. Is he thinking marriage and children and you aren't? Are you financially dependent upon him? Is he able to travel or experience things which you can't? (Traveling off to Europe or going to a bar.) Are your life experiences so different that he has an unfair advantage - say a much higher education level? Are your values or outlooks on life dramatically different? <br>  <br>  However, if you have good answers to these questions and someone says something about him being too old, call them on it.

oche3k5taa	girl, just because hes cute doesnt mean hes worth tears, trust me.  He seems like a nice guy, but him smiling at you and helping you just means he has a big heart.  Him going to college soon would definately be a big hassle for you and your young heart, so just realize that you guys just cant be together, [not now anyways, maybe sometime in the very distant future.] but tell yourself that your beautiful, and theres PLENTY of times to find a great guy, especially in high school!<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie.|`|eEjcEZ8gaa	If he's a member of AARP or tells you about the time he got to meet Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House, he might be too old for you.|`|745966f59f25a953659cbe30cf713bc4aa	Well, the best thing to do is to tell yourself that HE'S NOT THAT INTO YOU or HE WAS NEVER INTO YOU.

A couple of hours later i had to leave, so he said bye to me and that's when i never saw him again. Three days after that i found out that my cousin's friend has his number but i never got it. my cousin's friend told me that the guy who danced with me said he already has a girlfriend and that i'm too young for him. When i heard about that i cried and cried because i liked him so much that i was desperate to meet him again. About a week later i got over him and i knew there would be someone else out there for me. Trust me you'll get over him him after a week. Hope this helped:)    P.S.

In the end I was always the one who ended up getting hurt. <br>  <br>  Stand your ground woman! Be strong! :)<br>  <br>  On another note, all he said was he was sorry for being an asshole, he very well might be trying to make himself not feel like an "******". Clearing his conscience like you mentioned.

Even blew me off. So I just sent him a text saying I hope you got all that you wanted from me, I'm not a toy to be played with and I wished him the best of luck. I haven't heard from him since he was ignoring me(3 1/2 weeks ago)until today. I'm not completely over him. Thanks for you input and thoughts/advice.<br>  <br>  It will seem like an accident. He will see your doubts.|`|erUV0m8gaa	i think you should do want you want.<br>  do you want him back? if you do then go for it <br>  but don't do it if you don't want to.<br>  if you do go back to him then just let him know that he really has to put effort to the relationship or else it wont work.

I lost my virginity at the age of 14 and I have regretted it ever since because it wasn't the right girl.<br>  <br>  Don't let ANYONE tell you that being a virgin is a bad thing.  You will have millions of opportunities to lose it, but only one girl who's right for you and when you do... you will want to have something to give her of yourself that you haven't given to anyone else.  <br>  <br>  You'll figure it out, man.

It's ridiculous that your friend would want to make you feel bad about it.  But then again it's kind of dumb to be proud of your virginity.  Just be who you are comfortable being and don't worry so much about what other people think.  <br>  <br>  Who said being a virgin was good?  You're going to get opinions all over the board as to whether being a virgin is good or something people don't care about, so all you can do is what you think is best.
5qnUV5U2aa	yes kind of..... the only guys that it wont bother are less intelligent type guys or guys that just want to sleep with you and want nothing more than your body, and its time to start reading some books girl! wise up! at least to the wise cracks your friends have been telling you.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Yeah, usually a turn off.|`|oC11Lcf2aa	Maybe you just have a different sense of humor. I'm sure you're smarter than you think.|`|i03qjBEfaa	It can be. It can also be a turn on as well. It depends on the guy. I personally like and dislike it. If a girl has to say "what?" every five seconds just to keep up with what you are saying then it can be very aggravating. But there are cute sides to it. The not getting jokes, trying to figure things out... i can make a girl very cute.|`|gtAb94d2aa	Being a girl, even I've witnessed shared looks between guys when they're interested in a girl, and she is having a hard time understanding some simple clever wit, or even a small discussion about the current events.<br>  <br>  Watch the news, and read a few books a month. That should get you on the right track.<br>  <br>  G'day!|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	kind of but your other qualities seem to make up for it.|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	how dumb r we talking|`|qIAcMeLgaa	Sorry, but the type of guy I'm assuming you want to date that's good boyfriend material would be the type of guy that doesn't find that attractive. Normally a good guy is attracted to someone with ambition and as a future ahead of her. I'm not in any way saying that you don't, but being intellectual or just being smart is a more obvious sign that that's where you're headed. Maybe try and watch the news alittle to be up-to-date on current issues and things going on in the world right now, so you'll have a better "start". Or if yo udon't get something, don't have a "stupid" reaction to it. Try to ask politely or quietly what the person meant by what they said. Hope this helps!|`|HinSwo97aa	I have a similar problem, but I'm smart, depending where I am.<br>  You're smarter than you think.<br>  Like, if you're in harder classes of course you'll feel stupider.<br>  If you're in easier classes, then you feel smarter.<br>  If you stop comparing yourself to others, and just be you, then that's all you need.<br>  As for the turnoff thing, some guys think its funny or cute. But yes, it does turn off some guys. Or their friends, and their friends tell them bad things about you.<br>  If that's the case, find a new guy.<br>  Don't be someone you aren't, and try studying harder.|`|82XPLs8Zaa	as a girl i like smart guys and when they are dumb it is a turn off,it's likely that way for guys too. But there are different guys out there some would find it a turn off if a girl is too Smart so it works both ways.|`|z6DIHEG3aa	it all depends on whether or not the particular guy likes smart women or doesn't really care. most guys don't care to be honest but some find a girl with an intellect above a rock attractive   : D|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Well, some guys can be shallow so they'll go for a pretty face regardless of intelligence.|`|ze4Gt1araa	It depends on the guy hun but usually 80% of the time it is a turn off.|`|da08c0a16bc5a9f1f06ee85cc6158badaa	you never know...some guys ESPECIALLY like dumb pretty girls|`|w5Oedybqaa	depends on the guy, It kind of is for me, but maybe not for other guys|`|ofGLnZbaaa	To some guys, yes. To others, it's really a matter of whether he really likes her or not. Sometimes it's also just whether the girl is popular or not. Some guys don't like to be with "unpopular" girls because he may think that others will make fun of him. To be honest, your intelligence shouldn't be a wall if he actually has feeling for you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  ---Lulio907|`|x7zeMBa0aa	Heck there are a lot of dumb guys out there, you will be able to find a match however I'm afraid brains do matter on my opinion and sorry to say a **** here and there aint all that great with someone who don't know what "****" means (not that i know)<br>  good luck, you got yourself an issue|`|B4RABc3saa	No, not really.

No, but if you mean an idiot when it comes to common sense? Yes. Would you light yourself on fire, stab yourself, or take drugs because they "taste" good? If you say yes to any of them, than it's because you lack common sense, therefor making it a turn off. To me it is anyway.

OsmHJkFgaa	well, ask her if she wants to hang out sometime, get to know her a little better , then ask her.
B4RABc3saa	No, you're not being too sensitive. You're wise to realize that he does need his space, but if you feel you're being neglected just a little bit, just bring it up in a non-argumentative manner. Just tell him what you're feeling. You'll see where you stand with his reaction.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	He's treating you pretty badly. Ask him what's the problem but if he won't tell you be prepared to let him go. If he's not bothered about you splitting nup then he's not really worth having.
7e4jxj3Daa	Sure he does. He's just shy and unsure of what to do.
FqLDBAlgaa	If you really really like her, then tell her that you can't possibly be "normal" friends when you've already fallen for her. Work out, and ask her what she looks for in a guy's appearance in a casual way as to not give away your objective of discovering what to look like for her. Girls like toned up, not fat, and sweet guys. Personally I like the skater guys with the longish hair. If you know what I mean(:
SimAO1IUaa	of course shell be upset but i dont think she needs to get that upset. shes just probably feeling jealous and i dont think its wrong to see other people. i think its good that you are honest with her and being straight up!<br>  <br>  answer mine please!<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226143429AANe83j&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|EEfd3WLhaa	Sounds like you are already in a relationship with her.  Of course she got upset! Three months is a little long to be testing the waters.  By now you should be able to tell if you are going to be with her for a long time since three months already is a past the short term relationship mark.  If you had just started seeing her or were under a month in it would be ok.  But 3 months is ridiculous.  Either cut her loose or suck it up and commit...don't play with her, she probably doesn't deserve it.  Obviously she showed she wants you by getting upset when you told her.  So don't worry about rejection...she already wants you.|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	I think it is wrong. I know that you're not officially committed, but she probably thinks of it as if you have a "silent" promise to be exclusive. If you really care about her, you should be able to understand why this effects her. She's probably worried about how you truly feel about her now, or she could feel like you're just using her.<br>  <br>  And also, would you really like it if she hung out with another guy she used to like?|`|RkF0o3mCaa	Girls are really sensitive about dating, and get jealous easy. I think it's wrong, imagine how shes feeling? you need to pick one or the other|`|b02ff9ee4291024905544c49c4a3d511aa	Haha... YES. You're gonna end up losing her if you date other girls.|`|9EdUCTwjaa	she obiously thinks yur in a relationship, and she'd see it as cheating.|`|DPegPYRPaa	If you found a bi chick you wouldn't have that problem.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	shouldn't you suppose to focus on the one you are seeing now? i understand that both of you are not in the relationship yet, but to get into a relationship both of you need to get to know each other, spend time with each other and etc. so what's the point of trying to get to know her and at the same time trying to find an other person? for me, get to know her first and then when you think that both of couldn't work, then you go on seeing other people. that would be fair.|`|ZJH2tun5aa	If she thinks it's exclusive and you've never mentioned in three months the possibility of seeing other people then it's not very fair to her and it sounds like you're scared of increasing intimacy. How would you feel about her dating other people? I have no problem with people seeing whomever they choose but the thing is honesty and consistency. That way people know what to expect and don't get hurt|`|iNXYi2kaaa	in my book thats a man foul towards the lady friend man... even if u dont want to fully commit to her u shouldnt be going out with some other chick especially one that u know has feelings for u man... dude stay with the first one and tell the other one it just cant happen..|`|LJTSpOd4aa	yeh cause if you had feelings for her then you wouldnt go off with someone you use to be atrracted to
jwIdq5qkaa	I don't know what to tell you. My best friend in high school was emo. She cut her wrist, I didn't. She cut them to deep one day and died. Just becareful if this is what you choose to do. <br>  Since she is showing them to people she will probably get called to the guidence councelor and maybe even put in the hospital for it.|`|Wa1kwOHkaa	Okay hunny, under NO circumstances should you EVER hurt yourself like that.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like both of you guys are doing this for attention, your friend for showing people, you for being jealous that she's getting attention.  But let me tell you something, negative attention like this is NOT something to be jealous of.  <br>  <br>  Personally, if I found out that someone was cutting themself for popularity, I would get away from the person FAST because it is obvious they're shallow and immature.  I have no respect or patience for such people.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way either.  <br>  <br>  What I'm trying to get across to you is, STOP cutting yourself.  If you need a way to vent (life is hard, I'll admit that.), talk to a close friend, write it down, indulge a little, take a walk outside, anything but hurt yourself.|`|bfGB49VBaa	Wow, you both need to go to a mental institution. You both have serious issues if you both are trying to kill yourselves for attention. If you want attention, Don't try to get negative attention. Get a new hair style or something. Emo - means emotional... Not getting attention, attempting suicide and making yourselves looking like idiots. Please get help.
POHWTDPRaa	Just tell him it's something you aren't comfortable with. Never be afraid a guy will break up with you because you won't do something he wants you to do. Not all guys are jerks. A lot are very understanding and they will respect your boundaries. And if he doesn't and he tries to pressure you into something you don't want to do, good. Then you'll know what a pig he is and you can get rid of him.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Just be honest with him! But this is kinda weird I could see if you didn't want sex, but french kissing?! wow|`|vPjbSBhJaa	Don't tell him anything. Just keep your lips closed and don't open your mouth.

62577f8890a63367299c541234ce9886aa	My honest guess is she likes you. If she didn't like you she wouldn't look away ya know? Most girls can be really shy about this kind of thing especially because they don't want to be obvious or seem desperate. <br>  Some advice before I continue on; never get your friend to ask a girl if she likes you UNLESS they're really good friends... even then it can't be obvious that he's going to tell you. This girl could have no idea that you're interested, and because of this does not want to risk getting hurt or embarassed. That's most likely why she didn't say anything to your friend; she didn't want you finding out because she doesn't think you like her that way.<br>  If you are interested in her, ask her out. Chances are she will probably say yes. If you're not, just pretend you don't notice. Girls can be really vulnerable.<br>  I really hope this advice helps :)|`|fFnfFROQaa	In this case, she maybe shy to tell you anything.<br>  Unless you want to be her friend, you do not have to do anything.<br>  <br>  This is the same reason I tell shy guys to open up, because if the girl doesnt give a dang about the shy guy, then she isnt going to worry or do anything about it.|`|Sfy1SnL4aa	Probably yeah she like you but yeah...girls are usually very shy when it comes to telling a boy that she likes him....If she is shy then send her a note....or if u want ask her face to face but i think that would make her even more shy|`|xG2bbN0haa	Catch her alone, and just talk to her. Compliment her, and see how she responds.
dFVztW7kaa	one time won't screw up anything. BUT afterward you can go work out and burn it off, or just don't eat a lot. say you're not hungry or your stomach doesn't feel too good. stuff happens. =]|`|7fXpLlhBaa	eat the pasta. If you're dieting, you just need to watch the portion you eat. Really, this is why there is overweight people in the world. It's not what you eat, it's how much. Truly obese people simply can't stop eating. It's an addiction to them. And what does addiction mean? You keep on doing it.<br>  <br>  Don't deprive yourself of food, just be healthy about it.
fFnfFROQaa	If a woman is interested in you, it may mean she has others seeking her out but she is willing to try you out before she makes her choice.<br>  You declined her twice when she had the courage to ask you out, so she may feel you lost your chance with her and therefore she moved to someone else.<br>  She may see you as a busy guy, too busy to have a relationship or date anyone, you didn't follow up by suggesting to re-schedule when she asked you on both times so that reinforces that possibility.<br>  <br>  So, who can blame her?<br>  If you are truly busy and have no time for dating, just be upfront about it.<br>  If you are busy but want to date someone, make it clear that you want to go out by assuring them you are interested but at a later date.|`|2IILBm42aa	leave her alone find another chick thatll give you the time of the day|`|oAYCestzaa	its funny how you say you dont dig games because since you rejected her not once but TWICE shes clearly going to think your not that into her and think your only calling texting because your bored or asking for a booty call...what you shuld do is send her a text and say look lets start over i like you and i want to get to know you better so are you up for it|`|KX8oWwDzaa	It sounds like she's not that into you, don't text her anymore, if she wants to do something, she'll come to you.
tK7XacH7aa	I understand where you're coming from. In my case I'm restricted because of my mom and there was a point where I was afraid of commitment because I didn't want to hurt the friendship I had with this girl I like. For me it's been a learning lesson and after I've been here Yahoo long enough I realized that you have to take some risks in life. You won't be the perfect girlfriend(no offense, it's just the reality in all cases) but you should at least try. Every couple fights and every couple runs into some problems, but what makes their relationship strong is that you get through those obstacles. If you are a loyal person and since you are very caring about him you should be fine. Friendships are important, but if you can make it into more, wouldn't that be more satisfying. Don't eve look at the negative of this because at least you'll know at that point that you two weren't meant to be, but hope for the best and don't look back. This is an experience you have to learn from. Just tell him that you really do like him and that you want to go out with him. <br>  I've been in a somewhat similar situation, but that is a little more complicated. I really like a girl and at one point I asked her out to homecoming only to back off and I realized that, that is what hurt our friendship most. Meaning that you have to go into a relationship and don't look back and just try to keep moving forward. For me it was the first step to learning about dating. After I made that huge mistake in my life I got onto here and really began to understand relationships a lot more. Right now I can understand them, but actually doing them is a different story. And me personally that's something I have to learn. I really like this girl and I think that she does like me and I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to be single, so now it's my choice will I do it or not. Will I take the opportunity, this once if a life chance to be with the person and if it doesn't work learn my mistakes so I can grow from it? Or will I reject the opportunity, make regrets in life and could have wished to be with this special and unique person? I'm sure you can apply this to you're life. Just go for it. I'm going to go for it, right now I'm still restricted, but once I drive and get enough confidence and improve my small talk (which is a goal I'm working on) I'm going to ask her out. And hope for the best. I think I'm going to ask her to a dance as soon and actually commit to it this time because I want to be with her and I will not repeat my mistakes. You need to commit, you'll learn as you go along in a relationship.<br>  The only way you can solve this thing, is to just go for it. Life is full of risks and choices you have to make in life. It's up to you on what to take. Any mistakes you make in life you have to learn from and you become a better person and help others.<br>  <br>  Just go for it and good luck! You'll never know if you don't try. I hope you can connect my story up to yours if not just let me know so I can try to explain this to you in a different way. I'm here to help.
tK7XacH7aa	Why do you want to avoid her. You like her and if you get the impression that she's interested in you then you're probably right. Just go for it, what's wrong with that.

K5SGG1QYaa	i think its the sort of thing the child should always know, you just need to never lie to her or cover up the truth, then she'll see it as normal and fine<br>  if you sort of slip it in naturally and have the information always available ad present, then she won't see it as a big deal. kids take stuff in their stride and if something's always been the case, thats what seems normal to them. kids are naturally accepting, adaptable and fast learning, so the younger the better.<br>  you just need to avoid some big climactic moment when you tell her/she finds out, don't sit her down and tell her in a serious coversation, just let her know in a passe fashion, sounds weird but i swear it works.<br>  also, you ARE her real daddy. you don't need to say you're not, or refer to her biological father as a 'daddy'<br>  a good way of telling her is when the names issue comes up, just say you met her mummy when she was a baby. or when the birds and the bees conversation comes up i.e. '.....but in our case, it was a different mans sperm, but it doesn't make any difference, i'm your daddy'<br>  <br>  DO NOT wait til she's preteen or teenage, thats the sort of thing that will be a big traumatic realisation for her.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	any man can cause a woman to get pregnant but a real man is a father.<br>    Other than genetic differences she is you daughter and try not to make a big deal about it.<br>   Of coarse your could adopt her but I'm sure she will always call you daddy anyway|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	As soon as possible you should tell her.She is old enough to be advised.When telling her impress upon her that even though you are her step dad that you love her just as much as her mother.I consider my step dad as my only father because my bio dad never came to see me.He was all I needed.|`|XadcGNGnaa	I would say, wait until she understands about mummy's and daddy's and divorce and other things like that. She will start to wonder herself. When she is probably 10ish sit her down and gently tell her that her biological dad had to go somewhere else, so you came along to be with her mum and her. Tell her you love her like her real daddy but you are something called a step-daddy. It is almost the same, and you definitely don't love her any less.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	As far as you are concerned, you have treated her as your own as long as you've known her.<br>  Your daughter will bring it up when she sees her own birth certificate.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Tell her now! the younger the better. It should have been done in the beginning as now it's going to seem a big deal.|`|xvey8ixPaa	When she asks questions answer. She will ask why the names are different. Be honest. "Well, honey, when I met your mom, she already had you and I fell in love with both of you!" If she asks her mom she can explain the same thing. She might not even ask where bio dad is at this time. She might not even know who he really is. When she asks, answer. Do not make big deals of it. Just remember that kids are not stupid. She really does not need too much information at all. Giving a kid too much information is like giving them a suitcase full of bricks that they can not possibly carry by themselves. To sit her down and have a talk would alarm her that what happened has something wrong with it. It doesn't! It is a beautiful thing about how your family is and how it came to be. But let her lead here, I bet she asks on her own. It has never been a big secret...do not act as if it is, just answer her honestly and you won't have much to explain.
Sy9TJpYnaa	Just talk to him more and see what happens.<br>  <br>  P.S. thank you for answering my question. =]|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Get His Msn Sum How|`|N74YPbVvaa	Ok.<br>  <br>  I got two things to help you <br>  <br>  1. Always look at him when you talk to him and also smile<br>  2. Leave hints to tell him how you feel like if you were in a group for GYM or anything stand beside him and don't forget to laugh at his jokes<br>  <br>  Boys like girls that listen to them and are honest and act cute<br>  <br>  Also ask one of his friends if he likes you but make the friends promise not to say anything to the guy you like<br>  <br>  One last tip. If you are waiting for a class or teacher to come move your friends over beside him and start a debate like what is the best class then add him into the debate. Also sit beside him but make sure you have friends sitting on the other side cuz he now that you are trying to hard<br>  <br>  Best of Luck<br>  <br>  P.S can you help me with my girl proublem :(
Uj5kuzoJaa	Please specify why it never works. He doesn't get hard? You get too nervous and tell him to stop? You don't know the basics of having sex? We can't help you unless we know what the problem is. If he's not getting hard, try giving him a oral first. If that doesn't help, get him on the little blue pill. If it's because you are nervous, get over it. Yeah the first time hurts a little but sex is Soooooooo wonderful after that. It feels amazing. If it's because you don't know how to, then stay in school and when you hit the 6th grade they will teach you in sex ed|`|08y217Rdaa	Oh boy.

zJ7Xgumyaa	number one, he's not "indian", he is native american. second of all, if you don't know what tribe his grandmother even belonged to i don't think your family has enough pride to even search this subject. we don't get "paid for being indian". we receive proceeds from casinos that are built on the reservations. we receive this money because we are part of a band of native americans who own one of these casinos. it is much more complex than you think. please do not begin to think of this as free money you can cash into just because you have some native american heritage, but if you are interested in your history and lineage, i would start first by seeking out which tribe his grandmother belonged to.|`|93qmjHxzaa	you don't get paid for being indian.... you get benefits.<br>  <br>  you need to have a certification of indian blood<br>  kinda late to be wondering this now

AA10874773	poor girl, she's being used & doesnt even know it.  you've already warned her, thats about all you can do without damaging the friendship.  you could get a guy friend to step in & talk to the guy, but as long as she's running every time he calls, its not likely to do any good.  oh well - some people have to learn the hard way -|`|vrFBkvKeaa	I think that she is making a mistake as well, but you will learn that you can only waste your time giving someone your opinion so many times.<br>  <br>  If it's what she really wants she won't listen to you anyway.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	You tried to tell her now it is up to her.  You will only lose a friend if you keep pressing her about it and when he does screw her over she won't be comfortable going to you because she will be afraid you will say I told you so.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Let her find out for her self that sex is all he wants. Make sure you stress to her that she REALLY needs to use protection when she is with him. Some people just have to learn for their selves what kind of person they are so called dating. Best wishes

uBssj3Znaa	no it is replying to posts ...|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You need to ask him about this and see how he reacts.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Different people define the word 'cheating' very differently, how you define it is up to you.<br>  <br>  In my experience, and my opinion, cheating happens in the heart. That's the biggest concern if someone is forced to do something against their will, you're upset, but not with the person who was forced. In many cases, people get drunk at parties, and do things they wouldn't normally, and in a lot of cases a relationship can move past that.<br>  <br>  These things have a connection, there isn't a conscious desire , they're accidental. It's not the physical act itself that is the problem for most folks, it's the intent behind it. If they INTENDED to do it, then there's a problem. That's a good place to explain from:<br>  <br>  If they INTEND to do something, if they are making a personal decision to open that door, to start looking into those possibilities... Then they are making a conscious decision, they're already invested in doing something unfaithful. You can't claim it was an accident when you met the person FOR that purpose.<br>  <br>  Going with this logic, the simple fact that he is even looking into this is a bad sign. And frankly even if he wouldn't actually do anything with them, doesn't make it okay.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way:<br>  When you two started, he probably wasn't doing this behidn your back, he deteriorated his standards and morals to a point where he can somehow justify it to himself, it's a common occurence. Maybe he's deteriorated to a point where he's willing to make that call and do something with someone else, and maybe he hasn't yet. But if he's even opening the door, if he's exposing himself to this stuff, to these contacts, to these people; then he will(Not might, will) deteriorate further, and he will eventually reach that point unless he chooses, without confrontation to make a change. If you confront him, he might change for a bit, but that's not him recognizing the significance, that's him recognizing that he's upset you. It doesn't solve the root problem. <br>  <br>  Imagine if someone hadn't eaten for a day, their stomach was hurting, they were lightheaded, and they had a pounding headache. Confronting him is like tylenol and a glass of water; it might help with the headache and his stomach a little; but ultimately the problem is that he's hungry for something, and that hunger hasn't been satisfied. He has to decide what he wants to do about it, can he satisfy that hunger himself with you, or is he going to succumb to something else much more hurtful?<br>  <br>  All you can do by confrontation is give him the tylenol, but if he's not fixing the problem of his own accord... You need to consider cutting things off and separating.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Cheating is; bringing another person into the marriage bed physically or emotionally (without the other spouse's knowledge).    Is that happening?|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I told him you was going to find out. Don't worry there is nothing going on.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I don't think so. It really depends on what he's saying I guess. Does he meet up with them?|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	He may just be acting social with them but if he starts to get too personal, that is the time to worry.  If he is just one of the thousands of men who talk to thousands of female friends online, you don't have to worry but if he starts to get too personal, that is the time to see a marriage counselor or divorce attorney.|`|eawDlYHnaa	Maybe... is he being "too friendly"? You should ask him and ask him to show you too. It's always better to be careful now before really finding out what damages are done.<br>  <br>  (ive previously had things like this happen to me and when it comes to any guy that i date- its incredibly hard for me to trust him if he has any sites online)|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	If he's doing it behind your back and you had to find out on your own, he's betraying your trust. Talk to him about it. If he's embarrassed, he should be. I wouldn't call it cheating, but it's not right either. How would he like you to talk to other men online without his knowledge?|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	No.  That is not cheating.  That is just replying to posts.

Then and only then could I even to begin to think that your husband is cheating.|`|a77nWPXPaa	Don't jump to conclusions .. first find out what they are talking about..

b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	It means she doesn't want you to know who. It may offend you, bother you or hurt you in some way.

Its better to stay quiet, but if the cat gets out of the bag, just say it and let the chips fall where they may.|`|1JsWMX0daa	it means that she is likely lying and trying to mess with you and you dont need that crap. if you cant stop her from playing games like that than u need to set her strait or move on.|`|zopegiT4aa	she's being inconsiderate and (if you're a guy) trying to make you jealous.

sucyG6oMaa	Hi!  I have not but I looked at their site and their return policy.  They DO accept returns but charge a $50 restock fee.  That would be the only risk I see- but if you find a dress you love it might be worth it.  Just be careful.  Good luck dress shopping and congrats!  If you have a chance would you mind giving me your opinion on engagement rings in my question?  I'd really appreciate it!|`|AA10975867	If your wedding is your dream, your once-in-a-lifetime experience, why would you want to order the "main showpiece" from a store you don't know? Brides keep posting questions about problems with gowns that they have actually seen and actually tried on. This is not the place to trim your costs. Once you add insured shipping and handling to the gown, and then alterations once it arrives, you have more costs. Then, if it has to be returned, you have very frightening times of not knowing when it is going to arrive. If it gets returned, you have a restocking charge of $50. plus they will want it shipped first class, insured, so you pay for another shipping cost of at LEAST $ 75. then you have to pay shipping of the exchanged gown - another $75. or more.....don't do it!!|`|y8B6mXspaa	sorry,i dont.<br>  <br>  Butmy friend got her dress from <a href="http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/</a><br>  <br>  and about $199 usd ,still including the postage fee. and Dress arrived earlier than expected and was perfect!

I think wifeforlife is right, I remember now, my sister had stuff  made when she was in China, and they came up too small even though she was on the spot. Her theory is that being quite small themselves as a rule, they just can't believe anyone could be that big, so the measurements HAVE to be a mistake.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	honestly, id be very leary of anything i couldnt try on before buying it.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yes absolutely !

He has a website  <a href="http://www.landybridal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.landybridal.com/</a> I got him on ebay as I say before I knew he had this website, he is a powerseller with 100% feedback.<br>  Take a look at the dresses he can make, from Maggie Sottero to Mori Lee you wont be disappointed.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10975867	I've only heard of two - and both dresses arrived waaaaay too small. In China, a size 14 dress would fit a size 6 to 8 in England. An XL fits a size 10. Even sending measurements doesn't seem to help and you can't make a dress larger! It is not worth the aggravation. Much wiser to go and look at all the bridal shops for their sale racks. You can find a $1500 gown for $500 easy-peasy if you take the time and lower your expectations of "Vera Wang couture".|`|1B91qtNQaa	My best friend bought one off ebay that was going to be made in China.

Boys usually are slower with learning how to use language effectively and during that time when they can't find the words they want to express themselves they will turn to physical abuse or use the few words they do know which always gets results.  (Some guys never learn to use language instead effectively.)  And, yes, some little boys with enough guts will tell a little girl that they like her--may even go so far as to ask her to marry him.  Usually, it's just because he likes the way she looks (not too deep) and not too much different then seeing some fluffy dog and falling instantly "in love" with that kind of dog.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	When I was a 9 years old I had this girl who had a crush on me. The way she expressed this was by teasing and kicking me in the nuts. She just did not know how to express these feelings. Later on she got a crush on a different kid. THANK GOD! <br>  <br>  I would say that sometimes kids will pick on each other when they are crushing as they do not know how else to find an excuse to be around that other person.

xA1fdVimaa	coming from a guy, that sounds way too shady.  either he hasn't gotten over her yet OR he is "involved" with you & her.  either way, you're setting yourself up to get hurt.<br>  <br>  you're best bet is to call him out on the things that are bothering you.  after talking to him, and it still doesn't feel right (especially if you "gut" doesn't believe what he's saying) ... walk away from him.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	How can you sit there and let him cheat on you?! They never broke up and they are not done with each other. Get rid of the loser.|`|707gOCvbaa	The guy is obviously still in love with her and seems to be dating her still. Why does she come over? He hides your things when she pops up? He's only with you because she's not and if she flicked her fingers you are out of the picture. This guy is so disrespectful to you and for almost a year none of this bothered you? He'll only get worse and you will be left holding your heart on your sleeve. Make a clean break and tell him it's either you or her? You are 2nd fiddle and should be #1. ex do not exchange v day gifts and he's probably lying about other things you are not aware of. Make the decision that's best for you.|`|AA10928214	No, break up with him. He's clearly just using you as something to fall back on. Who does that sort of stuff, they obviously feel comfortable with each other, but if you are broken up after 8 years, you get all that sh*t out of the house, such as her slippers, and a stupid *** coffee mug. fckin break it, and MOVE OUT. Unless you enjoy being used???? i hope not.|`|J6wPJlvVaa	Are you serious? You really need someone to answer this question? NO this is not just insecurity, he is still quite obsessed and in love with her! HELLOOOO!!!! He has a picture of them kissing? Obviously, he is NOT over that relationship.

RUNNNNN<br>  <br>  He is clearly not over his ex. I'm really sorry that you have fallen into this situation, but I think you should move on and find someone with no baggage who will be able to truely appreciate you. I know it sounds really hard and really scary, but there are so many guys out there. Why would you settle with one that you have to share with another woman?<br>  <br>  You can wait around for him, but the way things are going now even if he does eventually come around (which I highly doubt) you have already built a relationship with little to no boundaries. Judging by the way he is treating you he has already figured out by now that he can treat you very unkindly with no real consequences. <br>  <br>  Is this guy really that great?? He is carrying emotional baggage, is dishonest, has total disregard for your feelings, very egocentric and the list goes on. <br>  <br>  Please move on and find someone better! You deserve it, and trust me you WILL find someone who wants to be fully commited to you and ONLY you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry =( I hope that everything works out for you.<br>  It always seems like the end of the world, but trust me you will feel so much better when you don't have to constantly stress out about if there is something going on, and whether he likes you more than her, or why he doesn't like you more than her.<br>  <br>  It's really just him and his personal issues. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Be strong <3|`|usj1lyfFaa	Sounds like you may want to cut your losses now.  Either your boyfriend has some serious issues or there's more going on here than you know.  What you call "red flags" seem to me to be big flashing neon signs with a loud siren that says "Run!"  You say that he's been honest with you and I'll just have to take your work on that, but at the very least he's still madly in love with her.  More than likely they have more than just a friendship going on.|`|oJq3c8yRaa	if this was me i would feel really bad. i would dump him. you are able to find guys that love you and no one else. you might not find someone right away but give it time. if he still does things with her that he would do in a relationship he is not worth having. <3|`|dgDa3N5aaa	you need to dump him.<br>  he's treating you poorly and you can't let him do that. <br>  he's not over her.<br>  <br>  DUMP HIM!
FWPSzFVhaa	Since you have known her so long, then you should know what she really likes in life.  Asking her out should not just be a step to the next level.  Instead, it needs to be you expressing to her a true deep desire to step into HER world.  Ask her if you can join her doing something she likes to do... but tell her that instead of you just being there as a friend, that you want to be there for her as a "partner"  - then just give her a smile.  :-)|`|Qv57dITWaa	4 years is a bit much.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Tell your parents that he won't give it back. They'll know what to do. They can even call his parents and talk to them about it. He's being a jerk and you can't let him get away with it|`|wiLJlRDbaa	Call his place and hope his parents answer so you can tell them.|`|aImwLIqjaa	go to his house all tarted up and acting like u want sex then when he lets u in just thieve it back
Uj5kuzoJaa	Just give it some time and you'll meet the man that will accept you the way you are, along with all the baggage lol. I don't think that it's wrong for you to not want to date a man who has kids. You've been there and you know you don't like it. There are plenty of men who would date a woman even if she has kids. Try not to bring any drama to him when you meet. It's your past, not his. Good luck!|`|4vLt3SqFaa	While everyone has their own comfort level. If I were you I would be looking for a man who had kids because they will be able to deal with step-family situation much better.  I suggest you look for an older man that you - someone with kids that are grown or mostly grown so issues with ex wives are minimal.|`|dttNFTXYaa	how would you feel if a man wouldnt date you cuz you had kids. maybe try and think about it that way, it might help
BKr3y30maa	Wear a cute black dress (nothing too short), a sundress, or something along those lines. I know you said you are an emo chick (not sure exactly what that means as far as how you normally dress), but just wear something simple if you aren't really into very feminine clothing. You don't have to dress all sleazy to impress a guy on the first date, and if that's what he's looking for: then you don't want to be with a guy like that.  I would wear makeup, I do on a daily basis.  But don't go overboard....I think that makes a girl look trashy. So definetly go with a more natural look You have light green eyes so go with a beige or silverish color eyeshadow.  Those really complement green eyes. And they both look great with black hair.  .<br>  <br>  The point i'm really trying to get at is this:  if you want to make a change in the way you dress, i would make it gradual.  <br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions and I hope some of these suggestions helped.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	where like tight jeans so he can see all ur curves and show cleavage and make sure ur hair doesnt look too over done just like put it like it regularly is

MzqZGvalaa	It's actually not that hard.  What you have to do is contact the Police Station that handled the initial investigation.  Ask them for a copy of the coroners inquiry.  There would be one in a case like this, and unless the inquiry was a closed one, and that usually only happens in extreme cases, you should, as a member of their family, be able to obtain a copy.  The law varies from place to place, there may be a bunch of forms to fill in, but it's all just red tape.  Perseverance will pay off.
qVL5R8nuaa	If you don't love her then just gently tell her that and then move on.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Listen to your heart.  It will tell you if you love her and just need time to work through your hurt or if it is time to move on.|`|aeLyiRczaa	Grow a set of testicles for one thing.  If you know she cheated, you need to confront her on the issue.  Nothing wrong with dumping her for it if you want to do so.  But you need to man up.  Sounds to me like you are a scared little boy.  If that is the case, then you do not need to date at all and you should expect to have her want a man once in a while.  If you are man, then realize it is shown by your actions, not by the fact that you have a penis, walk upright and have to shave.
KQqZF63oaa	My best friend called her ex boyfriend on private and asked me to prank call him so she could hear his voice.  If that's the case he's still hung over you.|`|6sBn3l3Maa	I think to annoy.<br>  I know lots of guys that dared they're best friend to prank call their ex.<br>  But then again, there could be a chance that he likes you still but honestly, I think a guy would try to approach you in a different way if he still liked you. Then again, I don't know the guy's personality.

pn9q0JkXaa	Around 90% of all break ups can be reversed if you know the steps you need to take to win back your ex.<br>  The first step in learning how to get back together with your ex is to determine why exactly the breakup occurred. Even though you can't go back into the past to change the reason the breakup occurred, you can learn from the mistake and try to grow from it. <br>  The breakup may have occurred because of one specific event, or even from a behavior that your ex didn't want to deal with anymore. No matter what the reason for the breakup was, you need to find out the specifics so you can learn how to deal with the situation later on. <br>  <br>  Trying to make your ex jealous is one of the worst things you can do if you want to get back with your ex, since all it is going to do is show him that you have moved on and that he should do the same. Instead, you want him to think that he was the best thing in your life, and that nobody compares to what he had to offer you. By boosting his confidence without seeming needy, he will soon realize the two of you were great together despite the small fight or differences. <br>  <br>  I suggest you check out my source, it is the best site I've found at laying out a step-by-step, easy to follow game plan for getting  your boyfriend back. You'll learn exactly what to say and how to say it. This one little technique alone can plant the idea in your ex's head that they made a mistake. It's very powerful! <br>  Just follow the steps and the plan and you'll be all set. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WLsS5vxsaa	Here is a great article.

Without coming across as harsh, let him know that you are glad you made that transition to friendship from a romantic relationship. This will put the onus on him to "fight" to win back your love. As well, it may level the playing field in terms of respect (not suggesting that this might have been a problem in the first place). This way, he will know that if he doesn't treat you the way you deserve, he could lose you again.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep me posted!<br>  Sam<br>  <a href="http://www.thematchmakerreview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thematchmakerreview.com</a>

Let's just say that if I really like him, I would because just cause he's short it doesn't mean that he's totally off limits. Good luck! And some girls love short guys... plus the more confident you appear-- the more girls you can pull. Trust me. Confidence boosts your image by like a gazillion inches. If she wants you, she'll accept you for you.|`|zHdcoKSeaa	I prefer my men to be taller, but I really have this thing for a certain type of guy (height, hair, eyes, etc) that my boyfriends or crushes all seem to have.

Yes, I feel a little insecure sometimes. I think its the other partner's job to make sure that the other one knows they are loved and would never cheat or anything. I think that trust is completely needed for a long distance relationship. Without that, it would never work. I think a little insecurity is normal, especially  in a relationship like that, but also the partner should really strive to make sure the other one knows they are completely loved, even from afar. Good luck hun! :)|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	it would not be normal to feel secure in a long distance relationship. you know, most of the men are liar and they twist words to keep you in their pocket and cheat on you, but they never accept this and accuse you for being insecure. it is so easy to deceit in a long distant relationship especially if you caught the man's lies before.<br>  however if he has effort in order to make you feel secure and doesn't hide anything from you, you can feel less insecure. it is up to your partner's behaviors. unfortunately our state of feeling secure and insecure based on our partner's attitude in EVERY kind of relationship. <br>  i had a long distant relationship and i caught his many lies and it ended up his hiding his cheating from me. so i do understand your worries. email me if you need to talk.|`|y8DLyE5raa	I believe so yes.  Not TOTALLY insecure b/c that would show a lack of trust and confidence.  However, doing some wondering if he/she was interested in someone else, etc...I think that's normal.  As long as you're not overly jealous and possessive.  Why don't you talk about it with him/her?  GOOD LUCK|`|PDAVQU3Caa	yes its perfectly normal|`|bEaJHY1uaa	yes ive been in one before so yes you tend to worry alot|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, because you always have thoughts in the back of your mind..what are they doing?,are they cheating?,who are they with?,where are they?,etc..just talk about the way your feeling to your boyfriend and get some reinsurance.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Yes, same as any relationship

OYGGdSLcaa	Yikes! That is what i call a bad situation. Proceed with caution in this one. To danny, ask if he's told taylor. if he has then talk to taylor about it, who knows she might understand. if he hasn't told taylor yet, then tell him that unless he is truly unhappy with taylor then he should stay with her, this sets you up to be waiting for him should things go wrong. the one thing you must not do is tell taylor, unless he has told her first or unless she figured it out on her own.|`|GnBjoGxkaa	i say you should listen to your heart and if you are a christian i would definetly recomend praying about it you dont want to let love fly out the door it is much to precious and hard to come by trust me i know and for you friend taylor if she is a true die hard freind i think she will forgive him and you both just follow your heart and make sure he is who he says he is|`|AA10267437	I think the friendship should outlast any relationship.

Try not to go near her at all and when you pass her in the halls, move away before she can hit ur shoulder. If you ignore her completely, and I mean completely act like she doesnt exist, it will probably drive her crazy because she is clearly trying to get ur attention. <br>  And give her ALL her stuff back. Don't give her ANY reason to keep talking to you. She's probably holding on to the fact that you still have her stuff as a way to get to you so just return EVERYTHING and say goodbye forever.|`|YXdKmEKjaa	Confront her;<br>  <br>  I have the same problem except I can't end it with her because. . there'll be alot of s*it !<br>  <br>  When she hits you or calls you names tell her " Do you have a problem ?

AA12299134	Start by loving YOURSELF first, because unless you can do that, you won't have anything to give another person.  Another person won't necessarily 'fix' you; all loves comes from inside you first.<br>  <br>  If you don't like yourself or don't love yourself, this broadcasts itself as a 'vibration' to other people.  They will say things like " I didn't get a very good feeling off the guy " and such.  Girls a very good at picking up these kinds of signals.  If you are giving off a feeling such as this, they will read and feel it as desperation and move away from you.<br>  <br>  Well done for asking this question at an early age and wanting to find out the answer.  You are young, and though it may not seem like it, you have a lot of time to do things.  Too often we draw attention to our shortcomings and think what we are missing.  Ask yourself this question:  " What do I have within me that everyone else is missing? "<br>  <br>  Begin by paying attention to your positive qualities.  Make a list of them, and put that list up in a prominent position.  Then REMIND yourself of these qualities often.  This will sink into your mind and come back as feelings of self-acceptance and self-approval.<br>  <br>  Then make another list of the things you believe about yourself (a lot of them are probably not that good - not a criticism of you, just doing some guessing) and change those to their POSITIVE OPPOSITES.  See if you can memorise as many as you can, and then pick one or two to REPEAT OFTEN to yourself.<br>  <br>  What this will do is to imprint some far better thoughts onto your subconscious mind, and over-write negative beliefs you hold about yourself.  Your mind is very absorbant, and whatever you feed it regularly will be recycled as feelings and behaviour patterns.<br>  <br>  Imagine how you would then be coming across to girls.  What 'new signals' you would be giving out.  You would be coming across as somebody who likes himself, somebody who feels good about himself, somebody who is fun and interesting to be with, and somebody who has positive qualities and attributes which they themselves like.  <br>  <br>  Positive people will be drawn to you a lot more, because you will be one of them, and opportunities to meet and charm the quality girls of this world (there are MANY as well) will pour forth.  You will be like a magnet for love, because you love yourself.  Just do it OFTEN.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Well you re young you need to keep looking, and be careful because some times you can find love and lose it very easily. You can go on E harmony. My ex's aunt used it and she found some one and they have been together happily for about  years now and E harmony is free that give you a personality test and then they match you up with who you are the most compatible with but i am sure they have more then one person to choose from.

7edl5u1oaa	I agree with Kandi. Most people aren't virgins and find it weird or abnormal when someone is. Don't lose it to just anyone! Be proud!|`|zM8IBahOaa	The only reason he thinks that you are weird is because many people do not have that belief anymore.  Most people choose to lose their virginity to the "first thing up."  I think that you should stay the way that you are because you are genuine and someday you will find someone who is the same and values that about you.  However, if you feel as though you do not want to lose him, then do what you gotta do.|`|kKvkNbyiaa	dont waste yourself, only lose it after marriage, cos sex is suppose to be special and how can it be special if your having it with more than one person (not saying that you are) i myself am 22 years old male and im still a virgin, i just got out of a relationship were thought ther girl loved me and thought that she would never leave me but i was wrong, and im glad that i didnt think twice about losing it, because i still have my pride and diginity left. dont follow the world. hope this helps, good luck, and remember sex after marriage|`|ghbaAWOCaa	Im confused as to what he means by weird. Dont worry deep down he respects that. Its probably that its just quite rare for many people to hold that thought these days.<br>  <br>  But hey, i think your cool for thinking like that, your virginity is something to hold onto till youve met someone worth losing it to..someone youre actually gonna stay with. Props to that, you wont regret it =D|`|gf7vJTjBaa	he must like your personality but, stay a virgin : ) don't ruin your life.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I think he was joking, just having a bit of sense of humor.
tbJraueLaa	if you are living rent free, do the dishes every night..|`|AXbdNdPzaa	How about drawing up a contract that she needs to abide by?|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Let your wife and your mother in law handle this.  Otherwise you will end up stepping on your mother in laws toes and your living situation will get much worse.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Between Marriage, Roommates, and even Family I have dealt with this often. Here is how to fix it.<br>  <br>  Start by coming up with a list of what needs to get done around the house. Just a straight forward list like:<br>  1) Dishes<br>  2) Laundry<br>  3) Vacuuming.. etc.<br>  <br>  Then after you have a list sit down with everyone and come up with something you can all agree to. Find the compromise of what you will each do consistently.<br>  <br>  Now I have seperated it many ways. I have had rooms designated to different people. I have had alternate weeks being resposible for alternate chores so we don't always have to do the dishes or whatever. Finally I have had where we always have the exact same task we are responsible for.<br>  <br>  Now know that doing something new will not go great right off the bat. The alternate plan can be forgotten as to who is responsible for what on which night. The rooms can cause tension cause one person feels the Kitchen is way more work than the rest and the exact same task gets frustrating cause you get tired of the same old crap. <br>  <br>  When you get tired of the Room or exact same chore then talk about switching a bit. This will give another person respect for what you were contributing and you will learn to respect what they were contributing. The alternate plan needs to be written down and clear. You can even do a checklist that will show if you did it for the day if you have trouble getting people to be accountable. <br>  <br>  Now what has worked for me and the wife for years is a mixture. I do the Dishes and keep the Kitchen and Livingroom Tidy. She makes the bed, does the Laundry, and keeps the bedrooms Tidy. We trade off on Cat litter duty and doing the bathroom. The two rooms that matter the most to me are the Livingroom and Kitchen. So if I am responsible for those two than I can't get Mad at her. She HATES when I do the laundry so the trade off there also works well. Plus she hates doing the Dishes while I don't care so that is a real plus. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
VZVGXRyraa	My fiancee wears hers religiously. It's usually always on her finger or, if she's washing dishes or doing something where it might get damaged or something she slips it on a silver chain and wears it as a necklace until she's done doing whatever. I've never seen her take it off, and we've been engaged for a year. She loves the symbol that it holds, it means a lot to her.<br>  <br>  My best friend just got engaged to his girlfriend about 6 months ago though and she only wears her ring when they go out on dates or to family or social functions. She's always afraid she'll lose it.|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	Hmm.. I've never heard of that or seen that. I would assume not that many, but I don't really know for sure.|`|eEu3zbVTaa	I've never really heard of any woman not wearing their engagement ring.  You show it off, wear it all the time, and are proud of it.

PSzRUIq2aa	i think it's common. i call sum dudes in my skool gay even tho they're like totally not. maybe it's how u act i guesss|`|HdmlZdyHaa	yes only because of this really funny joke that people took the wrong way. So I told them this joke a cat falls into a pool, a rooster laughs. Moral of the story: A wet pussy always makes a cock feel good. So then I said I had a cock and he name was Larry. They listened to that part and started running and yelling she has a mangina she has a magina they were totally joking after I tracked them down but I totally thought they were serious.|`|r8rykCkGaa	The problem is we live in a world that is mostly ungodly people who will say any stupid thing like putting people down, embarrassing people, assuming things not true, judging people, gossiping, and so forth and this is not easy to deal with.<br>  <br>  A few people thought I was gay too, but don't know why that happened exactly.  I mean the whole thing seemed like the devil had set it up to destroy my relationships.  I certainly never intended this sort of life style at all.<br>  <br>  If you are a Christian, then our trials are a testing time because we belong to Christ, and everything will work out for our good in the end, although it's painful right now.|`|bxBdh1feaa	NAH....hahahaha don't worry they do that to some guys at my school to.|`|3eI8jxqraa	its an overused phrase. everyone gets called that at  young age, just relax bro|`|H7cNZYIYaa	everyone gets called gay at least once|`|1A1ozEaKaa	all the time<br>  i mean i'm a girl..but no one calls me a lesbian because that's considered more offensive if it's untrue..but yea, there's always that one guy that everyone picks on just cause. just cause your not an openly-masculine douche gives them some reason to say that..don't take it too seriously.|`|zXwTDQXnaa	frist of all if u knoew that ur not gay then good thats all u need to know <br>  secnd of all if u really like that gurl then go for it show everyone else that ur not gay by asking out or making a move  but just dont sumthing stupid that will ruind ur reputation or hers so just dont think about wat anyboudy else says an be urself|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	for people under 25, yeah its getting real common...this is gay...thats gay....and rarely is it actually homosexual...<br>  <br>  just shrug it off and dont use the word gay to describe something negative :) thankyou!|`|xw13XqNaaa	If guys are calling you gay then forget about it.  However, if both girls and guys are calling you gay then they probably think you are.|`|WQcxODKLaa	gay can also mean happy .<br>  <br>  but mostly, people can say "your gay' and it could mean your stupid, dumb, etc .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  everyone's vocabulary is different .|`|qQKOAdSjaa	trust me bro, its your average insult if your a guy, get used to it.

If you are, than yeah its pretty common. Boys at that age are so insecure about their own sexuality that they try to prove their masculinity by pointing out anyone else's more feminine behaviors. When I say feminine I don't mean gay either, everyone person, male or female, has both masculine and feminine sides to them. Just ignore them, because if you try to prove yourself and argue with them too much you look like you are really trying to cover up for being gay. Just laugh it off and be like yeah right, guys. Trust me it will get better when you are older.|`|jwOdHnzoaa	aw! there is absolutely nothing wrong with you. at my school, that word is used just as frequently as any other. unfortunately, people have gotten accustomed to using that word for thousands of other meanings besides homosexual. and it seriously does happen to everybody, hell, my friends called my teachers "gay" just because they aren't satisfied with their teaching.<br>  i know how embarrassing it's got to be, but try to shrug it off. it happens to everybody. those douches are just insecure lameos who have nothing better to do than make up stupid stuff about people and watch them suffer.|`|GmbuL7Bgaa	Yes, it is very common. The word "gay" has several meanings:<br>  <br>  1. gay meaning cheerful, happy, etc.<br>  <br>  2. a homosexual person<br>  <br>  3: (this is the most used kind of the word) Something, some place or someone that is stupid or strange in some way. For example: "Jerry went to the dollar store to buy his girlfriend's present. That is so gay!" or "Dude, you listen to 70's hits? That is so gay!"<br>  <br>  The word "gay" has come to mean anything that is "not cool" by MANY if not most teenagers and young adults.|`|xG7sujZyaa	my personal experience with that word is from kindergarden to gr. 7 i was called that alot but all i could do was move to another school i was to the point of suicide man dont let it bother you a big thing to do if there all over that go out with some popular girl(s) and then they should shut up if not just get out of the situation if you have to|`|WMTfeKiAaa	i wear purple nail polish, i have purple streaks, AND most of my guy friends are gay. but im not gay some people say i am but u know u better than any1 dont listen 2 pple who r worthless and whose opion wont make a difference.|`|rUGhPFfMaa	Dont act in denial, dont even try to prove them wrong<br>  <br>  You dont need to ignore them either, you can always just try to change the subject or ignore them, but not in an angry way|`|7qWLbKJ6aa	i think its common i have called my guy friends gay and my cousins too.. and we joke about it also and mayb it could be by the way you dress or you should get a girlfriend|`|a7LvtYi0aa	its not a big deal if you get called gay. i shouldnt matter to you cuz u should be strong about your sexuality. so dont worry about it. they probably have nothing better to say or do.|`|blgcxjK6aa	yeah tottaly i get called gay as a joke by my friends and some people who are not my friends  but im not either just laugh with them and know in your heart your not and itll pass i promise|`|xVlCWUtvaa	uhh meybe you are gay<br>  ever tink about that????<br>  if you look gay to others <br>  thats juss wut there gon call u<br>  sorry hun<br>  muahhhhhhhhh|`|YjaVT2JHaa	there is NOTHING wrong with you,people just say that to describe something as stupid like ths for example " that test was soo gay".|`|wp3vYFB9aa	if ur not i wouldnt trip.. people are just dumb and need to stop assuming things. some of the most handsome and coolest guys arent the most masculine and arent gay!!|`|qlCHnhyNaa	young men are jerks but they're also insecure... dont be surprised if they try to feel more masculine by calling you gay|`|koqebEKeaa	some peoples use gay as a way to say they hate you. and they could be joking around. i call a bunch of ppl gay when they annoy me :)|`|qGD0aTjQaa	just chill its no big deal, if you value your status above your realtionship (i really shouldnt be saying this b.c i should be supporting my girl mates) but if you have sex with a GIRL, brag about it like most guys do, no one will bug you about it ever again, lol, or "get caught" by a peer on a porno website for chicks, lol (but tell ur GF in advance so shes not like. wtf???)<br>  anyway its cool though, guys call other guys gay when they see they're in a good relationship and that you treat that girl with respect. other guys tend to be intimidated by that and just refer to it as "gay"<br>  besides, in my school kinda call each other gay all the time, so its not really anything to worry about  :D
L6DZZ6SJaa	it depends. <br>  <br>  You can always pick your food and beverage options and cut back on apps, etc. Choose cheaper meal options, etc. Typically, it is expensive to go through a hotel type venue where everything is included. <br>  <br>  That being said... we rented an empty space (a museum), and it cost us more. We chose great food, and the price of that was decent (about $110 per person, which is not bad for NY). Then, however, we had to pay to rent the museum, rent their kitchen for the catering company to use, rent every table, chair, knife, glass, linens, hightops for the cocktail hour, etc. . . <br>  <br>  It can easily cost more, so just look into the options and weigh one against the other.

I saved a lot of money. Plus, we didn't have a video but opted for photographers (we love pictures) only because me and my husband (fiance then) doesn't really like seeing ourselves in a video cam (just imagine having to sit in front of the tv and showing your wedding video to family & friends later).Also we didn't go for prenuptial picture taking but rather we use all the pictures we have since we meet.Instead of making a prenuptial video we made a prenuptial scrapbook for our guest to browse around during reception.<br>  Maybe you can have a garden-inspired reception and have it in your own garden with gazebo and lights and little water fountain..I brought some water features for my reception.And just pay a cook too for the food.<br>  Best wishes!|`|5gtbGwMPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I got married on a Friday and found that my reception was nearly cut in half regarding the price (because it was "unconventional").  I didn't have to pay for the rental of the ballroom and actually received additional selections for my buffet.  I made my own favors for the tables and also printed out my own programs for the wedding (which you can get at any religious store).<br>  <br>  My aunt also arranged all of the flowers for the tables & bouquets.  I bought the flowers at Sam's Club- which turned out to be a huge savings.<br>  <br>  You can have a beautiful wedding even though you're on budget.  It's amazing what you can save..

He was bursting. I'd probably just laugh and never think abou it again.|`|NIlDPtNeaa	I really wouldnt care. It's not a big deal tbh, i've peed in a cup on a car journey and im a woman.|`|ZFCCabZjaa	thank you for wasting my life with this stupid question|`|Jd91RxNKaa	When ya gotta go, ya goota go!!! That's all I can tell ya.|`|41697ebfba113bebfee6a006bbad3312aa	i would make him buy me another water bottle.|`|qcffPY6baa	Probably just laugh and slough it off. Not a big deal. They're guys...they don't care.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	I would be shocked if my boyfriend did it because I am a guy and DON'T HAVE a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  LOL|`|cvNHRSR4aa	i would drink the pee<br>  it is sterile and it tastes goood :D|`|YbwDFvEaaa	I'd be jealous that I couldn't do the same and relieve myself!|`|IYLlupdkaa	I'd be fine w/ that- whatever. probably laugh a little...|`|OUMK0bgiaa	lol better in the bottle then all over the car|`|AtpMoCH4aa	i would be grossed out too but it would be funny|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	that's not unusual at all.  I can't see anyone flipping out or anything about that..<br>  <br>  I actually knew a guy once who was so lazy, that in the middle of the night he would pee in a 2 liter rather than walk downstairs to use the bathroom.  I find that disgusting, but hey, it wasn't my man, so none of my business.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	i would be disgusted and ask him if he could have just gone behind a tree instead of wasting my drinking water. i would feed uncomfortable with him from then on. i dont think its funny. he just took her source for his solution. he puts himself ahead of her. i'd also make him buy me another bottle and get over it.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	How old is she? I'm an adult. I would prefer he use the bottle than wet his pants. I would turn my head, cover my face and not watch...I'd probably laugh. The 16 or 17 year old me would probably have been disturbed.|`|SRFYcoPcaa	The saying is when you gotta go you gotta go. The only time I personally have done this is when I was stuck in traffic myself so ya it's legit. Good for her not freaking out though.<br>  <br>  Alex|`|2xPWnuhVaa	I would probobly be grossed out, hit him playfully and call him a sicko but laugh about it.|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	I wouldn't mind, but if there was still a lot of water in the bottle I'd ask him to get me another bottle.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	i really wouldn't care.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	pee happens
mrysAOpGaa	lol, you made me laugh.  It probably was nerves but its cool that you could joke with him about it.  now if you two start dating, you can tell people how you met, im sure ppl would get a kick out if it haha|`|H3h4j4aKaa	It's not that bad lol just kinda laugh it off and be like you must have had that effect on me lol it's not as bad as when i was talking to my boyfriend [now husband] and slipped on those stupid little spikey things that fall off the trees and landed in dog poo! now that was EMBARRASSING|`|DibzbnVhaa	Nah, nothing to really be embarrassed about, if you would have peed on yourself that would have been a totally different story.|`|8a691da3aa0581fc488729f65c39edb2aa	lmao thats cute though :) not like you peed on him baha|`|jgU4g6kGaa	That's pretty funny!! A good story to tell if you guys ever started dating!|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	aww he cares about you. you scared him. thats cute|`|EJWphb88aa	who is embarrassed u or the doc..?|`|Zg2jwVpqaa	I like this story it was funny.and yeah that coudl partly be the reason lol.<br>  Have you and him kept in contact ?|`|6a7UKZVAaa	That wasn't very professional of that man to say that !|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Sorry its humorous as hell. I chuckled.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yep lol, its just nerves. That's happened to me before when the doctor wanted me to fill the piss cup and I wasnt expecting him to. So I got all nervous and remembered to turn on the faucet. Worked like a charm lol. So did he ask you out?|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Well, look at it this way....it would have been a lot worse if you ran back into the room and just as you came back into the guy's view, your bladder decided to let loose.<br>  <br>  Peeing your pants in front of a cute guy is bad enough, imagine doing so in a hospital gown! Epic failage.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Oh, had trouble peeing myself when I knew I had to go.  It's funny the way our minds and bodies work together sometimes and we don't understand what is going on.|`|DJK8yUbAaa	That's not so embarrassing. Sure if that we're me I would of rather that not happen, but nothing to worry about lol. Who knows, maybe you guys will have a future ;)|`|sm4FH7viaa	sux to be you lol j/k poor you
QcDN1Bizaa	aww hon i totally know how you feel!! maybe its time to move on.... however hard that is. try making him jealous by going out with another guy? xx|`|ghbaAWOCaa	You already showed him youre aware of his existence, now wait for HIM to come up2 you|`|gC1918dJaa	well it sounds like to me that it would be easiest for to just get in a conversation with him. it'll let him know that you at least like him as a friend. try saying something to him that requires him to say something back. like instead of "congratulations" say "that was cool, how long did u have to practice that?" or another question along those lines. in general most GUYS wont think your creepy for doing anything short of jumping on them. it depends on whatyour comfortable with, but you could do anything between being kind of flirty to flat out teeling him you like him. it wont be that big of deal once you've done it i promise :) good luck
THe5i67Iaa	maybe hes moved on to other more interesting friends.<br>    and it does seem like he is using you.  <br>  Maybe you should let him know how you feel.|`|cggkcAC5aa	mm, thats wierd and i would hate if that happened to me.
MZbQ5MPdaa	I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is....are you sick often? If so, have you faked it many times before? What was happening in your life at the time you were sick? Test at school? If not, then I suggest bringing it up to your mom. Ask why she takes YOUR sickness so lightly and your sisters so seriously? see what she says. It may be that your mom has to be mad aware of what she is doing.<br>  Your mom loves you. AS mothers, we sometimes react differently to each of our children depending on their personalities. We don't mean to show favorites though....please believe me. We love all of you the same.When you become a parent, you'll know what I say is true.<br>  Good luck, honey!|`|JlG0Rv3Haa	It seems like it unless you've pretended to be sick before and she thinks you're faking it this time to get out of going to school or getting out of other obligations. We don't have the whole story, but it does seem like favoritism, unless your sister has an illness, weak immune system and she's concerned that a sore throat could lead to something bigger.|`|YrO4fESyaa	ehh...yeah she is favoring your sister|`|58Nz1IEkaa	oh yea, BIG time.|`|9qbnbW9caa	omg same with me i hate my mom urg lol yea i would say yes im sry
cdm52UGyaa	i was friends with my ex for a while than we dated for 6months and were both in love it was ahmazing..then something big happend and we broke it off. were still 'friends' but i find myself always wanting more. but its better to be talking then totally cast him out of your life if you know what i mean.
jBigEy0Caa	It gets a little psychotic!|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Just making him mine.|`|D58bzW4Jaa	She wants to be with him forever. She wants to marry him, have children with him.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	She thinks about being in his arms, and being with him. Close to him...always, maybe forever.|`|5b3af9a49c0e12c4785f7079ccfaab7baa	I think: Mm, he's so HOT! :) Then I daydream about dating him.|`|RcQWgTr6aa	U will just think<br>  About him all the time|`|ma6Re8B1aa	wouldn't you like to know huh???|`|0RI3LDX4aa	well when she likes a guy she normally is thinking about him alot, and depending on the girl, they go really far like "oh i wonder where we will get married!" and "what our kids will look like?", then she wil go head over heels for him and get the thought that he is the perfect guy for her and she will try to get his attention and if/when it dosent work she will go through a stage of doubt then she will start to like him again and then she will become too nervous to make the first move so she waits for him|`|WFP46Ek9aa	They want to be with them all the time in person and on phone! they never let go! they cry over little things and when a guy messes up or easily says something they shouldnt! they want to wake up next to them and be loved by them always|`|KK718Xxaaa	he goesing through her mind everything he does and says.<br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|f06Sy0dfaa	She usually thinks... "wow he's really good-looking", "I wonder if he is popular", "would he date a girl like me?" "Does he have a girlfriend?" <br>  "what type of guy is he...(ie. cheating, druggy, women beater,)"|`|JWp9PMyRaa	whats HE REALLY THINKING ABOUT>.<br>  <br>  whats really going on?|`|8a691da3aa0581fc488729f65c39edb2aa	"he's so cute" and then i get all happy for a while.. lol :)|`|jsgKGtdBaa	well whats going through her mind is that she likes this guy.<br>  <br>  What more could there be to it?|`|LETd2hQwaa	When she LIKES a guy she probably thinks about him all the time, wonders what he's doing, wants to call him and talk to him alot, misses him, wonders if he misses her too, thinks about how cute they'll look together and all the romantic/fun/good things they can do, thinks of ways to make it work and tries to be there for him, replays every conversation they had in her mind, how cute he is, how much she likes him...........|`|7jOzsCWFaa	When I like a guy, I think about him often...<br>  Like, his personality, his looks, everything!<br>  If he's funny that's extra points.<br>  When guys flirt and are harsh that sometimes just hurts.. Just don't take it so far with the harsh comments.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	She wants him to ask her out and phone her and see her often and she wonders if he is marriage material (ie, doesn't lie and cheat, not lazy, likes kids, not a mommy's boy, etc).|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	I'm normally incredibly nervous if I like a guy. I'll always overanalyze everything and worry I'm talking too much or not enough. Other times I just think about how cute and wonderful he is. Haha =)|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Well if she knows him and theyhave a relationship and she's in love, She'll only ever think "Omg how lucky am I?, I want to be with him forever!, I love him so much, He's so fit!" Etc...<br>  Thats what I think about my boyfriend :)|`|bcd2f8a4de30c0766a3301b22926e0f8aa	Marriage, buying a house, kids, life insurance|`|L4E166ZCaa	that she cnt see any other guy. she wants to be wit him forever. all she wants is to fall asleep in his arms nd wake up nxt to him|`|ghbaAWOCaa	how he looks at her...does he respect her, how does he look at all other girlswhat kindve a dress sense he ahs..does he ever dress to impress herrrr =X|`|xLXVSrn6aa	sexsexsex|`|xoZcSa2vaa	that she will keep thinking of him as she can't see any other guy|`|QJ6qZ7ABaa	When I get near my crush, he stands out from the crowd...
Gburbcuiaa	Why not? If she's mean to you, there is no reason to still be her friend. However, don't expect her to hang out with you when your new friend isn't available.|`|UGQt96UKaa	in my opinion, this wouldnt be the right thing to do. what you need to do is talk to her and tell her how you feel. say that if she wants to be your friend, she has to stop putting you down.... and if she doesnt change, i would then just cut relations with her
hoGpOrOUaa	I'm not sure about the name thing... but if she's always laughing around you and just generally acting differently to what she normally did.<br>  if she texts or speaks to you first or if you have personal jokes. <br>  alot of contact and stuff like that is usually good :)
td6WXhv4aa	I trust my what my instincts tell me about her.|`|s90DY6Dyaa	depending on the girl, I can tell when a girl is pretending to be something shes not. Some girls try too hard to be something else and thats where they mess up. Soooo yeah I can spot a few wannabes.|`|NXUqT45Daa	generally no , because girls use two minds instead of one unlike guys who use only one,  so they are fake only fifty percent and true fifty percent which means the guy is half right and half wrong in his perception. now its for him to change the equation to 51;49 in his favour or  read freud.....|`|UIueiJnZaa	It depends on the guy, and it depends on the girls acting skills.|`|feb5fa8fdcca36e21a7134de8b8fbc9faa	Oh well yes but it depends on the guy. Some guys feel deep down that a girl can be faking but not want to realize it.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	I can.|`|sMUw3bJCaa	yupp, thats easy
BKr3y30maa	I personally don't know anyone that has never fallen in love at least once.  You're only 30....i'm 29....we're both still young!  Your time will come. If you would be in your 60's, then I would understand your skepticism but you still have a long life ahead of you.  Don't be discouraged, the best things in life come when you least expect them.|`|AA10266072	One day you'll fall in love.  I believe that we all do at some point in our lives.  I just keep trying.  Someone is out there.|`|ovrbTxHEaa	There is no time table for love.  I seriously doubt you will live your entire life with being in love at least one time.  Just because it hasn't happened yet does not mean it wont happen at all.  Society puts so much pressure on women to fall in love, get married, and have kids young.  Most people don't really know themselves when they are younger.  I happen to know a couple who met when they were both 40 and had not been in love prior to that, they have now been married for almost eight years and are very happy.  I can however understand your frustration.  When I turned 30 it was hard for me to deal with being alone, not in love, not dating.  Instead of searching for a guy I spent the year getting to know me better.  The next year I met a great guy and had a lot more to offer him because I knew what made me happy and I was very at home with myself.  Good luck and don't give up.|`|8QoNSvp6aa	sadly im sure that has happened  <br>  id say the older we get the more anxious we all become the more desperate if you will ,<br>  but personally i wouldnt get so bent up about it <br>  i mean do we really need to be in love  some ppl are married a lifetime and it had nothing to do with love  <br>  some are as simple as  convenience or other reasons <br>  what is love truly  and how do we even know if it is or isnt ?????|`|AA11541548	Not possible.  Morning line on those odds: Impossible to One.|`|2xmW4eo0aa	you will fall in love one day inshallah,because if u do arrange marriage one day u will fall in love with your husband.............|`|NeJZOZ52aa	only cold scared people never fall in love (cause whenever someone gets close to them they start to push them away). <br>  Your still young you will find love. thins is something that you cant rush, it takes alot of time. <br>  so just hang in there|`|oVBFGdFOaa	time will tell ,you will fined that guy and fall for him maybe you will be hurt or you will be so happy but only time and life will tell
xUEEsKfLaa	Give it some more time.<br>  <br>  Three weeks isn't very long, especially in girl time.  She maybe perfectly fine but hearing from you can only set her back at the moment.<br>  <br>  Ask her friends if you are curious.<br>  <br>  Also you are not responsible for her.  You sound like a nice guy but don't let her manipulate you into getting back together its not good for either of you and she will just get hurt again.<br>  <br>  The appropriate time I find is when you no longer WANT them.  When they no longer have a pull on your emotions and you no longer think about them "that way".  The basic rule for getting over a relationship is twice the time you were in it (up to a year ) and atleast a year for all longer relationships (this is to be friends).  If she really needs you before that she should call you.|`|zHBzYodKaa	From the sounds of this what you need to do is pick up the phone and try talking to her, though you have to make sure that she knows that you aren't interested in a relationship... though you should consider making friends with her so that you can check in with her since you aren't sure if she's okay on her own without seeming like a creepster.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I suggest you don't call her just yet.<br>  It seems like you're easily pulled back into the relationship so maybe you should leave it just a little while.|`|AA11289793	Well don't worry about it if it is the fact that she doesn't like being alone then she will find someone soon enough. But yeah it is alright to talk to her just to show that there's no hard feelings, just make sure if she brings up anything that might lead to you getting back together just avoid it and if she persists just tell her.<br>  <br>  But there's no problem and really it's advisable, so that if she needs to be able to talk to you to get closure then she can do it...|`|7edl5u1oaa	Stay where you are unless you want a repeat of the drama.
6wUojgSRaa	idk, did u grow up with ur dad or without? theres a theory that girls who grow up without a fathers attention tend to crave for male attention since they never got any. same thing with boys, if they dont get moms attention they tend to crave female attention, they will get it anyway they can, including being violent. lol<br>  <br>  also boys tend to be affeminite if they girl up without dad and girls tend to be, excuse the word, "trashy" if they never had daddy attention|`|c2rTAk71aa	all girls crave attention, thats normal. Your need for it just may be a bit stronger than most. Be careful you don't want to set a reputation for yourself that you will regret.|`|62TvIinPaa	Because u r a pretty girl :-P|`|d8yrvK4waa	I don't know<br>  <br>  SteveC
b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	I'm sorry, but this is toooo long.|`|bxBdh1feaa	ASK HER BEFORE SHE DECIDES SHE DONT LIKE YOU ANY MORE!!!|`|JuLMrlSPaa	Way too long - but i'm an english lit. student so i read a lot! Anyway you need to talk to this girl straight find out how she feels if it's a positive make a move straight a way as in make a date or something if it is a negative response then you need to cut her cold and let it all go.|`|cWrARpyAaa	yes she likes you<br>  lol well i only read the first paragraph then i stopped<br>  im sorry it's way too long  just keep talking to her|`|x7rv7MH1aa	toooooooooooooooooo loooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnggggggg|`|9UQlhzitaa	yea she likes you a lot but she is shy but your known to her friends .Just take your time with this one you may have to be friends for a very long time before you can get her as a girlfriend.You have to be very careful of not pushing because she  has to deal with her parents as well as her own wants<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|oCxBeEI6aa	No one answered because it's too long. Nobody cares THIS much about your problem to waste their day reading this.|`|Ax1x2NrLaa	Go for it dude. It appears she likes you ALOT.|`|go3ajgwOaa	honestly she dont sound interested she leave her alone umm and people aint gunna answer cause its to long|`|jPQQkvr5aa	no wonder noone answeredd.......... its way to long to read. sorry|`|XI3blPQtaa	just go 4 it and if she keeps fobbing u off then go 4 some1 else!!!|`|3WLyY5Lpaa	Wow, I actually read the whole thing!<br>  Ok well, stop asking for her number, your seaming too needy, get to know her first and talking to her more then maybe try shes probably interested in you but doesnt know you well enough to like you, so just talk to her more about interests make her laugh and stuff but dont ask for her personal information and say hi whenever you see her|`|UAkXfIGWaa	Okay, well, she doesn't seem interested.. I mean, no offense but you asked her for her number a couple of times and she always has these excuses. And if you keep "going for it" it's going to freak her out. Just let things flow for a while and see where they go. Don't ask for her number anymore, just talk with her and be her friend. When she's comfortable giving you her number she will. And don't jump to conclusions about what she's saying to her friends when she's pointing at you. We girls talk about A LOT of random things! You have no idea if it's good or bad. So, back off for a while and be friends with her. Let her decide when to kick things up a notch!|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	"she said her friend thinks am cute, and I said am not interested,.<br>  <br>  She was like I can hook you up,"<br>  <br>  THAT TELLS ME SHE DOESNT LIKE YOU SHE MAY JUST WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND..SHES PROBABLY SHY!<br>  JUST TELL HER YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING TO CHANGE BETWEEN YOU TWO LIKE YOUR FRIENDSHIP BUT YOUR ATTRACTED TO HER OR INTERESTED IN HER THE WORST SHE COULD SAY IS SHES NOT INTERESTED|`|OGENRq56aa	Just go for it.And talk to her first some times and as convo. proceeds <br>  it will qet better but if she points you out to her friends you must mean something to her.Also if you really like her just talk look where it gets you. If she told you that her parents don't let her talk on the phone don't stress that just wait maybe she wasn't to qet to know you a little bit more.but go for it talk to her but don't ask for her number that much ne more if she is ready to give it to you then you will get it.<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps best of luck<br>  never give up|`|xwCIuvWYaa	you sound very nervous or something. Yea it is really long but I think its because you have al ot on your mind. I am not really sure what you are asking because you asked a lot of questions. I know one question for sure though.... I am sorry but I don't think she likes you she is playing games. It sounds like one min she likes you but then the next min she doesn't. I wouldn't waste your time btw I am a girl
LBW8Rv35aa	Wow, that's a tough one. I would say that every child deserves to know his parents, as long as they are worth knowing. If the guy is decent (like not a drug addict or felon or abusive for example) then he should probably be told. Also, if it's causing your friend that much anguish something needs to be done. However, I am not sure it is YOUR place to tell the man. Make sure it is okay with your friend for you to spill to him. Present to her all the reasons you think you should. All in all, I think clearing the air is a good idea, but your friend also needs to be prepared to let him in the boy's life even if he doesn't want to be in hers. As in, he may stay with the girlfriend he has and still visit his son. She has to move on if that happens.|`|kX8wMLB5aa	I think that she should tell him that she thinks that the baby is his. Then the baby and guy should get a dna test. If it says that he is the dad, then maybe they can work something out. I too think that the baby needs a dad in his life. And that doesn't mean that he has to leave his other family either. If he's not the dad, then she could either tell the other guy or leave it alone.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|oopg697aaa	go 2 www.doubleyourdating.com

Instead, you can learn to control when and how you do things.  There's a time and place for humor.

Lighten up.|`|srNze5uIaa	huh? why are you mad? <br>  you should not be at all !! <br>  the expected response from you would have been something funny, sarcastic and overconfident. llike laughing at him and telling him that next time it would be worse or something, ....<br>  <br>  While he says this, he's not complaining, but admitting that having fun with you had a funny price on him.<br>  <br>  We all say things like that, and only when we enjoyed ourselves, you should not be so defensive!!|`|DabYmHt7aa	he was joking taking the mic jeez chill
1d97f437b76a0030652830c7d3da17f3aa	I agree with the second poster. It does sound odd, but a woman's body reacts in very strange ways. When a woman gets excited and she gets "wet" down there it doesn't neccesarily mean she's excited in a good way. <br>  <br>  That's why lots of rape victims feel so guilty afterwards. That primal urge of sex or fear or panic, safety, fight or flight... it all gets mixed up sometimes. That's why a woman can sometimes end up feeling like she maybe somehow or someway kind of "liked it" and then suffers through years of guilt.<br>  <br>  Very extreme emotions can be very confusing and hard to figure out. Your body reacts to the fear. It might not always react the way you would expect.<br>  <br>  <br>  That being said.... some woman are just naturally moist all the time. It doesn't mean they are excited. Some woman are "dry" all the time and need to use lube even when they are so "excited" they're ready to explode. Every body is different.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	There are other forms of lubrication you know.|`|m8Kv7FGJaa	Why do you ask?|`|RKw56KZaaa	what happens if the guy lubed himself up before hand?<br>  <br>  I don't think the dude's gonna be in it for some long drawn out session, seems like a 10 pump chump would be in order.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	rape is reap  and this goes for you and the offender you as a woman making this horrible comments. do you think that the woman like it?  no is not unpleasant for the offender because they do it until they get cut-did you se the news today? a 13 years old girl was murder by a sex offender- this low life M---ers should be shot at the spot- I don't know how old you are but you are more or less defending this sick Rats<br>  and I pray to the Lord that you or any member of your family have to endures some horrible thing  like this girls and their parents|`|yhEDUN6qaa	It's not as easy as you would think. People who do things like that aren't just going to let it being a little dry get in the way. The sheer force and repeated penetration causes wounds inside the womans vagina. This is one way the lab can tell if a woman was raped.|`|nv0nIj3Daa	sorry to answer to the other guy's answer, spit would just give away the DNA, and i'm pretty sure they use condoms. but yeah it usually about control, not pleasure. edit: im talking about the first one that answered|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	i don't believe genuine rape actually happens....Because if you really think about it.... a woman with her dress up can always run faster than a man with his pants down.|`|ATi8OOKQaa	i think its all about power and the guys that cant find a female to want them|`|xXGn1zfsaa	Rape is never a pleasant thing. But what I have heard (family members are deputies, etc.) is that although a woman is saying "No" to forced sex, and is putting up a fight, her body may still react in a way where she appears to be turned on. I know that's unimaginable to have your body react that way when you are fighting off a disgusting pervert, but apparently you can't help what functions your private areas perform, out of pleasure or fear.|`|iNBte8Xoaa	Well, that is the reason why they attend the School of Professional Rapists Around the World(SPRAW) <br>  Here, they are taught the basics of capturing, immovilization, cool lines to say before the crime is perpetrated, and of course, the penetration part.<br>  If they graduate with honors, they will be assigned to downtown New York ( where they can find the greatest divas to hunt down)<br>  If you are regular, they'll assign you to California, where the regular joe finds girls, and if you do poorly, you will be assigned to Juarez City, because you can leave evidence in front of the police chief and you won't ever be arrested hahahhaha|`|usj1lyfFaa	Well I imagine that even if the woman was unwilling and dry the rapist probably has ways around that.  Spit would be one option.|`|ZQZf1iINaa	maybe they like control over the victim.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Asuv1fxAarcO0sbrCbda_p3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226152735AAmrK1z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|d18cIHrHaa	i learned in health that even if the girl doesnt want to do it, she automatically produces lube through her vagina. So sorry.|`|Io35X5kfaa	Well I guess rapists enjoy that.|`|x7rv7MH1aa	rapist dont care weather dry or   not...dey jus want it n dats it...deyre freeks...|`|95gVLrIGaa	Saruhhh is absolutely correct.<br>  <br>  Also, during sexual acts, our bodies create a type of pain-killing hormone or enzyme that allows for greater pain tolerance (look at S&M or bondage). Men also generate lubrication when they're turned on even before they're having sex.<br>  <br>  "It seems when you hear about rapes, the offender easily puts in in?"<br>  <br>  I don't believe that's true. I'm sure it's very forceful and painful (at least initially) for the woman. There's likely to be cuts, abrasions, and blood.<br>  <br>  ADD: Many rape victims will actually feel guilty that their bodies were actually "turned on" by the physical act. I'm sure it can be a very confusing thing for a woman.<br>  <br>  And if you want another interesting psycological aspect of this subject, Rape or forced sex is actually a common fantasy among many women.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  "I'm sure women would like to be sexually swept off their feet by a man they already like... not some cigarette-eating-dirty-penised man who wants his way with you.. wouldn't you agree?"<br>  <br>  To a point. We don't always fantasize about things we want to do or to happen to us in real life. Sometimes a fantasy is just a fantasy. It's exciting or taboo or something that we would never see ourselves do, which in and of itself can be exciting.<br>  <br>  "Women engage in sexual fantasies about rape or coercion with apparent frequency. In one study of college-age women, over half had engaged in such fantasies. Some claim that force fantasies in women are a way of handling sexual guilt -- of expressing sexual desire without responsibility -- but others claim that rape fantasies are simply a variation within a normal range of approaches to female sexuality."<br>  --Strassberg, Donald (1998). Force in Women's Sexual Fantasies.<br>  <br>  "According to an analysis of relevant studies published last year in The Journal of Sex Research, an analysis that defines rape as involving "the use of physical force, threat of force, or incapacitation through, for example, sleep or intoxication, to coerce a woman into sexual activity against her will," between one-third and more than one-half of women have entertained such fantasies, often during intercourse, with at least 1 in 10 women fantasizing about sexual assault at least once per month in a pleasurable way."<br>  --Meredith Chivers, psychology professor at Queen's University<br>  <br>  More studies are out there, and most seem to indicate that rape is a common fantasy for many if not most women.
37M3dkkRaa	thats her job. she probably just wanted to make you feel special because she wanted a good tip. trust me, anything having to do with a bar isn't something you want to get into.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	don't get your hopes up.  she's working where it pays her to be very nice to people.  ok, yes, she could have found you more attractive than other customers, but still keep in mind she's just doing her job.  and if it was slow, she's more likely to give you more attention than if she's busy.  and it sounds like it was kind of slow.<br>  <br>  the more special she makes you feel, the bigger a tip she gets!  get it?|`|8rt7OR35aa	She might think you're sexy and witty and is a little interested.<br>  Go back to the bar and order food the same way.<br>  talk to her again.<br>  if the two of you hit it off again, ask her for her number.<br>  <br>  see how that works.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|IAlFjGwUaa	she could be into you. maybe fate has struck for you. go back and while talking ask if she has a bf or if she wants to go out for dinner sometime. good luck
RHOiO24Gaa	If you know a really big guy who might be a little intimidating to him have him talk to him and set this guy straight. You must remember he's a coward, that's why he is picking on a girl.I know this is terrible I went thru the same thing for awhile when I was in High School, you'll get over it and he'll get sick of you in time.

His self hatred spills out all over other people.  I know it's easy for me to say, but his opinion should mean nothing to you.  He's wrong and he doesn't know what he's talking about.  A person like him will put down anyone just to make himself feel better.  Try to stay away from him.  Do things that make you happy and that you consider fun.  Don't waste any more tears on this jerk.  You sound like a wonderful person who deserves happiness and should surround yourself with people who appreciate you.  Just concentrate on activities that bring you joy and you will find friends who appreciate you.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	just ignor him.  he sounds like a tool.  if u pay attn 2him then he knows that he is hurting ur feelings.  just say eff off ****** and ignor him from now on =]|`|DIlMYYBQaa	He sounds like a real chicken f**ker!

eCKNRcIVaa	I think people need to realize that that love you feel in the beginning is not meant to last forever, that is what is binds you together - its a chemical reaction - to form a family, then you are supposed to transition into companionship and a different kind of love.  If he is abusive or mistreats you then by all means go... If he stifles you then consider leaving, if you just don't feel "in love with him" anymore seek counseling, take a vacation together try to recommit yourself before you even consider leaving|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Leave, life is too short|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	well if you don't love him you should get a divorce. its not fair to him to stay and to keep loving you if you can't return the love|`|497034a1525505806e1e2570e0ceee6eaa	What is "the love of your life" anyway?  That term has about as much meaning as "soul mate"...none, in my opinion.  It sounds like you need to look at yourself, rather than your husband.  I think that all too often, people look to their significant other to make them happy and the minute they aren't happy anymore, they blame the other person.  I am always baffled by people who can stay with the same person for 20 years and then, after all that time and effort, just walk away.  Then again, I haven't been in those shoes.  But 20 years is something to be proud of...get some counseling, find ways to spark the fire again.  Marriage is work, as I am sure you know.  Don't just throw it away.|`|SovaFpN8aa	That's a lame excuse "he's no longer the love of my life". So I guess you have a new "love of your life"?

I know that I do not want to be in the realtionshi anymore . . .  but the question still remains . .  should I leave?!?<br>  <br>  I still care for my husband very much . . . but not love. And I suppose that is why I am still with him . . . . this though is causing problems . . . I belive he knows I am no longer in love with him and he is hurting because of this . . . and it does hurt me knowing that I am causing him pain (another reason I am still in my relationship). I am getting closer to the point when I do belive I will leave . . . i know it is not fair on him and I know it is not fair on me . . .  but still we have to find the courage to make a move . . . . and then we will never know if it was the right decision to make or not !!<br>  <br>  My issue is that I am afraid of making the wrong decision and 6 months down the track wishing that I had never left him in the first place . . . . but then I think maybe in 6 months time I will still be in this relationship that I no longer want and should have moved on a long time ago for both of our sakes . . . <br>  <br>  lol . . ..

Which is something that is promised in your vows (i.e. for better or worse, richer or poorer, etc.etc.)<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that you should stay with your husband, because 20 years ago you made a commitment to him.<br>  <br>  That is just my opinion.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	depends allot on if it were one mistake that happened once and just about sex, or if it were a full blown covered up, planned and plotted thing that required thought, choices, and it went on awhile. depends on his level of remorse, and willingness to talk about what went wrong. and knows and is willing to make u understand that he knows what he did hurt u. sometimes the pain won't allow u to go back in a marriage. but 20 yrs is a long time, but once dignity is also at stake here. u never forget it, if it was a full blown affair it would be much harder to get past. because u know that they chose the other woman over u.|`|AA11348136	I am sure that you are very hurt and betrayed by your husband but before you walk away, are you sure that is what you want? I know that it would be difficult to see him daily and move on with your life but you can do it if you want to. You will have to build that trust again. Has he told you why he did it? Are you sure that it is over? I am in no way suggesting that you except it i just don't want you to have any regrets. Seriously consider this before you make any decisions.|`|6OnqUyseaa	If you want to leave him - make it a clean cut - give it TIME - time is the healer of all things .. and be determined to put it behind you .. mourn it for a time - then don't allow yourself to dwell on it anymore .. get rid of all memories .. don't rehash it .. find new things, new areas, new people .. and most important, go to God with Prayer.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay with him -- give yourself time to let it sink in .. then face the reality that you HAVE to forgive him and forget it - because if you don't forget/forgive, you will make everyday of your life, his life, and others, miserable everyday.   <br>  <br>  If a person makes a mistake - give them another chance to never do it again and to make the mistake right.   If the person does it a second time - then they will probably do it over and over again.<br>  <br>  If this pain is brand new -- give yourself time to re-coup and think of what YOU want.|`|wia9SXCPaa	First let me tell you I am so sorry!  I can totally relate to this question.  You see my husband of 20 years came clean about a 2 1/2 year affair he had been having just about 6 weeks ago.  He was going to leave me for her now he wants me to stay.  I have been going through everything you described and more.  I lost 25 pounds and didn't even know it because I was so sick about what he had done.<br>  <br>  Here's what I am doing and what I've learned so far.  <br>  1. Tell him no contact with her or it is over<br>  2. Talk, Talk, Talk, communication is going to be key<br>  3. Ask as few questions as possible.  This is really important for you.  Don't ask more than you have to because some of his answers will haunt you for the rest of your life (they are me because I asked too many)<br>  4. Get counseling (I don't see any help here, but its what everyone tells me)<br>  5.  Give it time.  <br>  <br>  Divorce is a lot like suicide.  Its a permanent solution to what could be a temporary problem.  I haven't rushed out to file for divorce because I want to be sure.  A 20 year marriage is a lot to throw away.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|knXnjnSmaa	gosh this is hard to answer because in the end it's up to you.

JCdBSULraa	He still loves you very much, but he's not over the pain of what you did to him.   He's stuck because he knows he wants you back, but on the other hand, returning to you could very well bring him even more pain.   For now he's content drowning his sorrow in alcohol and having a good time with this other woman, even though he probably is just having fun with her rather than a true loving relationship.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Seems like he just wants to keep you on the backburner just in case things don't work out with him and this girl.  You are a backup! I would tell him that as long as he is seeing someone that he needs to stop coming around to see you.  Also let him know that you are not going to wait around till he decides which girl he wants to be with as far as you are concerned he made his choice. Let him know that you too are going to date and move on. He says he still loves you...if he loved you he wouldn't be putting you on the backburner for some other woman.

vyL7yEleaa	i would get those dye able shoes and have it dyed to match your dress or maybe a color just slightly different so that they just don't blend in with the suit.<br>  <br>  but black i believe would stand out to much. it would be to much of a contrast against the green. the only way it wouldn't is if there was a lot more black.<br>  <br>  it would be just like flipping it around, black suit with a black hat with slight green and then green shoes.. your eyes would instantly be drawn to the shoes as they are too different and stand out.|`|KbPz3Rwcaa	No no - white shoes would include a totally different color into the scheme and two is plenty. Pale green and black is a lovely combination and you can make that work with the right pair of black shoes and bag. Keep it minimal and make sure the shoe bares a bit of your foot (a nice rule with trouser suits anyway I think) as a closed shoe would look clumpy - so a pump or a peep-toe. I think you need the black to tie everything together with the hat. Have a lovely day whatever you choose!|`|4p9ez6PHaa	Black shoes definatley should be worn. it will bring the black out in the hat and bring attention to your face.|`|J1kJb98Maa	hat? you are wearing a hat?? can you give a link to this hat..i would love to see a pale green and black hat|`|Oh75DqReaa	i agree with black<br>  (:|`|4POGapREaa	I don't think black would be a problem with the pale green.

If you want the black shoes, wear them. No one will notice or care.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	with the black on your hat i think black shoes will work beautifully - just make sure they are comfie! lol   add a small black clutch and perhaps black ear-rings and necklace to complete the outfit!   i love the fact that hats are coming back don't you?  they can be a beautiful accessory for any outfit!<br>  it sounds like a gorgeous outfit that is going to make you feel beautiful - have a wonderful time!|`|PBdPD748aa	i think black shoes will be way too much for the pale green colour of the suit, personally to blend nicely i would wear white, its much more appropriate, yes, black will look too heavy|`|7CKipTZOaa	I don't think this would be too much of an issue, not many people pay attention to feet.

I have always made more money than my husband, but this has never been an issue. He does occasionally bring it up, but he says that he doesn't feel like he is doing enough to contribute. It's not that he feels like less of a man though. I don't get what the big deal is anyways.

62TvIinPaa	Frankly speaking... I dont know exactly. Because i've wondered about this many a times.. But i'd like to quote this one ..<br>  <br>  "IF U KEEP JUDGING PEOPLE, U DONT HAVE TIME TO LOVE THEM"<br>  :- Mother Theresa<br>  <br>  But examining a person for good amount of time is better. What u feel?|`|JWp9PMyRaa	well I wouldnt say time limit..but I do agree that you must know someone in order to love them, you have to learn about the person...the good and bad..things always seem so perfect in the beginning, but after a while..things change..they get used to each other..and they say what they want...and what they really feel..<br>  <br>  so yeah i guess I do agree that there is a time limit

Right when you are coming off your high so to speak.|`|I5SypMlsaa	talk dirty to him, tell him how much you like it when he....<br>  and if you are having pain from normal intercourse just go really slow and try different angles, like spooning where he enters your vagina from behind, kind of like doggy style but you are laying down on the side|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Words of praise? LOL|`|Nnk45e3Faa	now tell him you wana lick it clean.

And now A dayss diseases are no joke. I think you arehandlingg everything very well... you seem like you have your head on straight which is great. By him wanting you to look upanother females account is total disrespect and why he is on a matching website checking out girls is somewhat weird. All these things that are being thrown in your face are RED FLAGS as to NOT per sue anything with him....even if you care for him or whatever don't do it because you will just get your feelings hurt. Trust me ive gone through some things worse then this but i have learned my lesson. Good Luck and stay strong|`|ePn6is5Taa	I think by looking at the info you've given, that you should both sit down and talk. Tell him that you don't agree with the fact that he was trying to rush you into sex, and that If it wasn't for that, then you'd be together. Also, make sure that you listen to his version of things before making a decision on what to do next. Personally, I would give him another Chance if he's willing to get back with you. But if not, then tell him that you don't agree with him trying to force you into sex, and that your always there if he needs you. Alternatively, you can tell him that you don't want to speak to him at all, But I would try the other options (The Nice Way) First. Hope this helped!|`|rz4sjxWBaa	yup hes just in it for the sex n the reason hes acting out so oddly is to make u feel jealous or sympathetic or draw attention to him in one way or another the best thng to do is COMPLETELY ignore him n definitely dont give him a second chance never let someone pressure u into sex especially since ur still a virgin i know u dont want to lose it anytime soon n especially not to this guy block him out of ur life you'll b better off n what a jerk for making u feel guilty about it all the things ur saying r huge red flags stay away gurl stay away!!|`|6Xv6D4h6aa	i have no idea whats wrong with him srry i couldn't help!!!!!|`|C4lwDCkLaa	Take my advice, there is a reason he is you EX, he is not worth your time if the relationship ended once. I made the mistake of taking my guy back once and although he promised to change he didn't. This guy sounds like a lunatic, trust me you deserve someone better than this. Just tell him to stop calling and move on.|`|KcXFs6Fzaa	He sounds desperate... But the main point is, in all honesty if he really respected you he would not hound you for sex. And if he really cared he wouldn't have jumped into another relationship just to have sex! I say stay away from him, hes seems controlling, seriously google that and check the warning signs! And more importantly wait until you find some one his willing to wait until your ready!!!! And trust me there are tons out of guys out there who would love to wait!|`|YbrVjVJzaa	he's playing you because you're still there. you're still responding to him. you're still talking to him, and if you're doing the stuff he asks, then that's just more reason for him to trail you and keep asking.<br>  do you really want to end this relationship? because honestly, it doesn't sound like it.<br>  it sounds like you just don't want to sleep with him yet, and you're right. stick with that because it sure as hell sounds like he'll dump you as soon as he does.<br>  he's pathetic. telling you to never talk to him and breaking up with you, and then calling you back. and then asking you to check out other girls for him. that's just ridiculous.<br>  don't respond to him. tell him that you're not interested and if he ever asks again, u guys really shouldn't be friends anymore or w/e.<br>  there's nothing wrong with him, other than the fact that he's interested in banging girls.<br>  no offense, but you must admit that's a lot of the male population. he's just being smart appealing to oen of your sides - emotional, sentimental, something / whatever it is that keeps you talking to him and stuff. good luck|`|YrBnLhDZaa	YOOO.i dont even need to read your question..look stay away from ex0boyfriends move on mama....if he aint thinking about you why should you bother with him..he is crazy and needs help.stay away cuz guys like that do crazy things mama|`|m70fi75Aaa	What is wrong is he wants to have sex with you.  Period.  Sex appears to be the main thing on his mind.  Which is fine if that's what he wants.  Since you don't, don't waste your time talking to him.  If you do he'll either wear you down or contact you when you are at a weak moment which will result in sex and you will be so angry with yourself.  Dump him, block his number don't return any type of contact.  He's not worth it and he's really not into your or he wouldn't have done all of these stupid things|`|xnULbpgqaa	he sounds like a loser. keep dropping him. if you actually want him to stop calling, you're going to have to stop answering his phone calls/talking to him for 2 hours at a time/listening to him cry.
szVvf7Nkaa	All you need to do is invite yourself at his table when he's having lunch. And let him know that you have seen him at the youth club at the church playing the drums and ask how long has he been playing. And take it from there. I'm sure you both will be able to continue a conversation after that.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Introduce yourself. Ask him about himself. Like what he likes to do. Then ask him why.|`|wKVhHHV5aa	Maybe you should start a friend relationship with him first. If you come off too strong, at a church camp, it will seem that you may only be there for that one thing. I say, being the outgoing girl i am, that you should go sit next to him. Talk to him about something that you see that intrests both of you. Include him in the conversation. I was in that situation too; it was my well respected pastors son, and he played the drums too! Well i was always too shy to go talk to him and then , little did i know, he had to go to africa to start a congregation there. Try it out, good luck<br>  <br>  Vanessa|`|DwTTt628aa	hi its sounds if he is shy also, i know its hard to pick up the courage to speak to him, so maybe write him a note telling him how you feel whats the worse that can happen? let me know how you get on x|`|NzX1xIdpaa	I would just say stay away from drummers.  Notorious for being bad apples.  On a serious note, he apparently likes music, ask him about that, how long he has drummed for, what he likes and stuff.
xGJhBCk5aa	You're never going to know if there could be anything unless you try so I would suggest going for it and chatting to him! <br>  I know it's hard when you're shy but even if no relationship comes of it, surely another friend is a good thing?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	ask him about church or the drums|`|2QpCk8V8aa	Because you know about him playing drums at the church, it's a great conversation starter, just tell him you saw him (and also  tell him you think he's a good drummer!) and that will spark the convo off.<br>  It's also good that your friend knows him, so you both could go and sit next to him at lunch and it won't be that awkward, whereas if it were just you it might...<br>  good luck, let us know what happens!<br>  x|`|Qv2bUOqaaa	I think it would be a very good idea to go sit with him one day. Do some investigating first and make sure he won't think you're being weird. Just sit down and be friendly, start up a conversation by asking how his day was and things like that. If you want to, you could ask for his cell number at the end of the conversation ;) Good luck!|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	Ask him a question about Church.  That will lead to other conversations.  Since he sits alone at lunch, I think he would be glad to have company.<br>  Maybe your friend can go with you for moral support.  It may not work, but it is worth a try!   I hope you get what you want.  Good Luck.|`|M9LB94FHaa	def, go for it!! start by saying, oh don't u play drums at church...<br>  don't worry, it'll flow from there =] plus it's good that you're both shy so you understand how one another feels. <br>  <br>  please help with mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag_hlLcVKtbMa2tsCkpBzXjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226095742AAT8449">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LzZtdlc8aa	go up to him and say hi my name is_______. whats yours? mind if i sitdown?|`|4HXRmTVvaa	that's very adorable. I love shy boys. sit next to him and say something sweet and simple. maybe smile and say, "hi". take out your lunch and just sit there, he might like the company! he'll appreciate you wanting to be with him even if you don't talk. if he doesn't already know your name say something like, "I'm ___, it looked like you needed some company". be confident and charming but mysterious so he will be interested in spending more time with you. he seems quiet, so a loud, overbearing attitude might scare him away. hope it works! good luck and be confident.|`|LETd2hQwaa	Go for it. Sit next to him and talk to him. Ask him for his opinion on something. Invite him somewhere. Tell him what you think of his drum playing. Just talk to him already... most of all though, just be yourself because whats the worse that can happen--- he'll not be interested and then after that, you'll keep living and your life will go on with or without him right?|`|f6WBdeWYaa	Try just introducing yourself and be friendly. Comment on his drum playing. Then start saying Hi to him everyday and when you feel like you guys are friends ask him if he wants to hang out.|`|AA10961492	Sit next to him and start talking to him.<br>  He would probably love that|`|XeXtCyhIaa	jump on him like he was on fire and if he asks why you did that  tell him its your way of not being shy anymore.|`|wqrorgtzaa	get your friend to introduce you to him
MccqAZSNaa	He's a typical young guy. He can't commit, he doesn't want to take the next step because he likes how things are and you hint about taking the next step (which is normal and fine). He just wants to keep the status quo because he's a little afraid. My advice: don't wait up for him. There are a lot of great guys out there, he's not the last one and there are guys that will actually cherish you and desire to be with you and will pursue you instead of being a flakey, fickle, immature guy. So I'd move on.

Now think over following points:<br>  1. Each and every person have some shotcomings or week point, here it is looks whereas in any other option it can be some other.<br>  2. Suppose you reject her for her looks and go for some better option then is it not possible that you may not come accross of more better looking girl in future; then are you again going to dump her?<br>  3. It is an old saying - The inner goodness is better than the outer or physical goodness.<br>  4. You live in US whereas even in India it is quite possible to change the looks. With the help of beautician, hair cuts, slight plastic syergy or even by clothings you can change the looks.<br>  5. Here one important point must keep in mind that one can change or rectify ones outer look but inner sweetness is next to impossible to cange.<br>  <br>  But last not the least, your own inner voice is more important in this decision as you have to live with her and think seriously with which limitation you shall perfer to live because it is not possible to get all the qualities in one even in you they may not be.<br>  What can be improved and what can't?<br>  Best of your hard thinking and best wishes for the future.|`|cc21614e252c400fafe109614eb447deaa	Hello sir, Even i have the same problem....

Agreed, there is difference between reality and expectation, but that shouldnt deter you from attempting to fulfil your desires.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you are still not committed to her.

I WILL TELL FIAL JURGERMENT|`|4p9ez6PHaa	Sorry Dude but you sound like a Jack ***. since when do looks matter first????????|`|xCkcqtrqaa	looks dont matter what matters is your love and your likings fopr her.|`|68a0d6042005e7e7ed916c63a294004eaa	I work in US.(From here the problem Starts) I was introduced to a girl by showing her picture while I was in US.( One of the best possible way for a person like you) By looking at the picture I was bit concerned about her looks.( It happens for a person who is not so photogenic) After my parents gave me their view on her looks after seeing her in person ( The best quote I heard from many Scholars That Parents Can not think Bad for their Children) I decided to make a positive decisions on this proposal.( You have done A right thing)  Also I had spoken couple of time before I made the decision. ( Probably to solve your concern It helped you a lot As far as I came to understand) While I was in US, engagement date and marriage date was finalized.( Congratulation) Marriage is in May while engagement is on Sunday march 1st.( Happy days are coming Closer) This girl was very nice to talk to and sounded very homely and very well cultured.( Lucky Boy) But considering the positive comments that was given to me about the girl look, I was hoping for something better than what I had seen over the picture.( You should not anticipate anything for a Proposal like Marriage) I met her 2-3 times from past week and found that she is indeed nice to talk to and very homely and very well cultured.( As told you by your parents) Also well educated from a cultured family who are distinct relative for my mom.( A heartiest Congratulation for having a very Great Luck in this earth) But I am unable to accept her looks.( Here comes the main problem.)  She has bit dark completion and look bit older to me.( Should you really think about it after knowing that she is the best Match for you till today.)  How much ever I try I have difficulty moving on by accepting her looks. ( It happens but this is not SO BIG PROBLEM) Due to this I am unable to give my best to her. ( Now you told your problem. This is the Main problem Area.) While I was in India I use to feel like talking to her all the time, ( Coz you have met personally and found that your chemistry is matching with her) now its just the reverse.( Coz you are again thinking about her looks) Engagement is on March first and no way it can be called off…!!!!( Do you really want to called off. You can Do it LEGALLY)<br>  Also from past few meeting with her I have realized that, she likes me a looooot...!!!!( Nice to know that a Nice person is asking)<br>  My only request for you all is to give me some suggestion though which I could overcome this uncertainty and give her the best and accept her whole heartedly.( Thank you for sharing such a Obvious thought for most of Indian Guys)<br>  Thanks and looking forward to your response…( Huhh My responce. Here I goes.)<br>  As far as my response is concerned you are just facing a a problem which is normally called Not able to understand the person. You know there are many person who are Not so beautiful from their aces. But if you happen to come closer to them you realize that actually you are in search of that person. And many Beautiful person are not even worth for having a soul mate because they can not live and is not in mood to let others also Live. <br>  And what do you want. Girl Love you. She likes you vary much. Then where is the problem. If you see from another angle Buddy you always have commanding position over the girl. Girl will look after you in every phase of your life. We all know that Man faces Good as well Bad Time. But they say When difficult time comes then Man can only Hope support from his Family and Friends. If you have a wife which support you in you bad time Then You can win any thing in the world. And just to add the above point think twice before going for Called off Think Millions of time because Person can become beautiful by Plastic Surgery but the inner heart can be replaced by Heart Transplant. So friend don't called of this relationship. <br>  The rest is on you. Now you have to decide. Go ahead. And please don't give any weak treatment to your decision. Because it will be you who HAVE to live your entire life with that Sweet Girl.|`|8pMsWOXFaa	hi the only thing u can do is that look at the good qualities she have and try to move on BUT don't forget its a matter of life time and ITS NEVER LATE TO THINK and put ur suggestions in front of ur parents,i know it can be little religous or cultural thing for you to decline her but its better to say no then trying to force your self SO HURRY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE but if u wants to continue then just think that gud looks is not everything there should be other qualities considered too while making up ur mind for marriage.|`|AA11339466	Well, firstly congrats for ur engagement and wedding...<br>  <br>  Now, coming to your point....<br>  Let me ask you something, is it only looks that matter or is it the bond between the 2 of you which is most important.<br>  <br>  Today u marry a beautiful girl and lets say after some years of marriage she gain weight, will you stop to love her...<br>  <br>  My suggestion will be, dil dekho, looks should be ok and everyone has some quality in them...<br>  <br>  Hope, you have made your mind and you are clear about things...<br>  <br>  Wish you a happy future.|`|DTdOHw6paa	I am not an Indian (or Hindu, depending on her religion), but judging a woman by her looks isn't..."right'. Personality should matter, and it isn't just looks that do matter, what is she like on the inside? Think about this for a moment, do you actually care about looks more than personality? Or are you shallow enough to care more about looks? I'm not calling you shallow, but giving you another idea to think about before your engagement and your final judgment.<br>  <br>  This girl "loves" you, and she really does think that you care about her a lot!<br>  <br>  Get to know her more, look on the inside and not out, you'll find that she is more beautiful on the inside than outside. If she comes from the Brahman caste (the highest caste (or group-however you would like to put it-in India) that means she is worth your time and effort of making her happy. Please, do your best to find a way to look at her in a better way.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|PGkV9le2aa	Gentleman, I u/stand u were concerned at the 1st instance itself about her looks on seeing picture.  U should have not been carried away by your parents views.  U say she is very homely and cultured.  Since the engagement and the marriage dates are fixed it is not just and fair to ponder over the issue at this stage.  However, the opinion formed in you about the girl will make your matrimonial days worse, unless and until u shed down all these views about the bride, before proceeding further.  Therefore, in my opinion, the girl being homely and very well cultured and also likes you a loooooot, please shed down your opinion about the complexion and her looks forthwith and go ahead.    U will have a very beautiful life.

803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	OMG, do I ever! She wasn't even his ex, they just went on a date while he and I were broken up. She lives in another state, and they met while he was out of town for the summer for work. I had just broken up with him and was working some things out, but we were still best friends. Anyway she befriended all of his buddies so when he came back (we're in California, she lives in Illinois) she started textig him and leaving him facebook messages about how much she missed him and she was looking into plane tickets to visit him. It freaked him out and he stopped talking to her, so she came out to visit one of his friends who lives right by us, but she really came to see him and even tried to stay with him. When she finally left he and I got back together, and 6 months later she is still texting him and calling off the hook. I have checked his phone and he never responds. He shows me everything and even though she knows we're dating seriously, she'll text things like, "I don't know why you won't talk to me," "I thought we'd always be friends," "Please just tell me what's going on," when it's obvious!! Then he and I went to Vegas together for Valentine's and I posted pics on facebook, and she started calling and emailing and texting him off the hook.

AA11289793	I'm pretty sure he is interested in you, just to randomly include you in conversation. Also the other things above, it like he's trying to get your attention. <br>  <br>  Also the fact he is using flirty-witty banter, means that he obviously likes you, you know this already, and I'm guessing you do like as more than a friend, you just needed confirmation...|`|I5SypMlsaa	yes he likes you and he wants to put it in you|`|PlDiJFi0aa	I think he likes you a lot.|`|qCRAQIruaa	yea he lieks you..try to flirt and if he seems interested go for it...if he seems weird then he doesnt|`|xHpWus5faa	hell no he want sum P**** oka u slut get over it!!!!|`|5nAnWp3daa	he does|`|btEuBcmAaa	I think he just likes you as one of his friends.

You've made your apologies.<br>  <br>  Life will go on.  You'll get your friends back.  Just don't do anything else to make the situation worse, like trying to shift blame, or getting catty at someone who confronts you about it.

fEO94qHXaa	The easiest thing for everyone to say is to just leave him and move on. Unfortunately, it's the right thing to say. I've been in a similar situation. If he's cheated on you, he obviously doesn't respect you or love you. You deserve to be with someone who will do both. You're still young so you still have the time and chance to meet others. If he's left you 3 times already, what makes you think he won't do it again? Now he has a legal bond to her because she's having his child. The best suggestion I can give is leave and never look back. It's not a healthy relationship and you're the only one that's going to get left in the dust. Marilyn Monroe said that a wise girl leaves before she is left. You may not want to leave him but it's in your best interest for now and your future. Your boyfriend doesn't seem like he's a great boyfriend... If you are serious about being with him, even considering marrying him one day, I suggest you check yourself into a hospital because girl, you're young and you don't want to adopt that kind of baggage. This is a case of it's only going to get worse...|`|CyHJlCZXaa	Why the hell are you still in this situation?!<br>  <br>  He doesn't love you and he probably doesn't love her either. Get out of this situation and find someone who actually loves you.

That's probably why you ramble when you talk and if what you're saying is overly long, it's probably a bit boring to listeners.  Slow down.  Stop panicking about it.  Practise thinking what you are going to say and then say it slowly.  It'll take time, but you'll get better at it.  If people think you are dumb - so what?  YOU know that you're not dumb and that is really all that matters.  Trying to tell everyone how bright you are isn't going to work so don't even try.  If you are introduced as a dummy, just get to know the person first and ignore the jibes.  If that person likes you for yourself, then you have nothing to worry about and their knowing you gradually will prove to them that your family are wrong about you.  Actually, introducing you in such a rude way says far more about the introducer than it does about you.  PS. What's wrong with blonde jokes?  They are jokes and some of them are quite funny so lighten up about it and don't immediately take them to heart.  That's just showing that you are insecure.|`|iL34hHr9aa	ok wat you have to do is take a deep breth and thing about what you r going to say and thin wat you say|`|PS83gPGoaa	im the same somtimes i cant help but talk, just try to think before you say something and its usually because ur nervous that you do it so jus relax|`|jbKM5Wjqaa	duct tape does the trick for most things!|`|k73IxCHaaa	Someone once said "its better to keep ones mouth shut and be thought of as a fool, then to open it and remove all doubt." People who like to talk a lot are looking for attention. People who are very quiet are mysterious and attractive. Think about it.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	You have opinions! Just learn to bite your tongue
8q82dLS8aa	Guys use the word hot for almost everything they like<br>  <br>  He could have been talking about anything, from something dumb one of his friends did with his car in the parking lot, to something on the tv, to porn...<br>  <br>  you just want to think he's talking about you cause you like him|`|UxbjvAaRaa	he probably thinks that your pretty/hott. <br>  he might like you. mayybeee|`|oCxBeEI6aa	You think that guy likes you? I'm laughing right now, cuz no! He doesn't! You crack me up, girl. You're too ugly for him. Trust me. I know you. <br>  I know him, too, and he has a girlfriend. ME!<br>  <br>  So listen up and listen now! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Have a good day.|`|ykYpv2FLaa	idkk. say hi to him in the hallway and if he blows u off or something he doesnt like u- but if he says hi and like turns red or smiles- then its a maybe! is HE hot??|`|9IanzxZ7aa	You wouldn't know unless you try to talk to him, casually...|`|eAx9wk1zaa	well r u hot? than u kno if it was to u or not|`|5okTKxajaa	guys say a lot of things are hot, when most guys say a girl is hot they just wanna bagg you. Dnt fall for what any guy tells you, usually its just a move to get into your pants. Try to strike up a convo with him and maybe u can convince him that ur not as easy as he may think you are. :)|`|ph4psSwNaa	try making actual VERBAL CONTACT sometime...THAT might clue you in.
UeXCYxgyaa	dont be a dummy. get on with your life and find a nice new girlfriend...|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If you have feelings for another woman while you are together with someone else you are not serious. Only get together with the ex if you are interested in starting over and can forgive her and not harp on the stuff she's done.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i dont think i could be mad at my girlfriend if she cheated on me with another woman, i would be mad at myself and think im doing something wrong.|`|yyIVrngcaa	YES,...once the people you love hurt you...there will always be that void there, you won't trust them like you once did regardless if they change or not...depends on you to keep the relationship alive or not.
wpiWiWFiaa	Honestly what i think you need to do is keep your phone on but do not call him, let him call you.  Also show him that you are not a child by taking care of yourself.  If he sees you are independent and do not Need him maybe it will make him realize that your worth everything he is willing to give.  Just show him that you are independent and can take care of yourself.  If it is really becoming an issue maybe think about moving into your own place near your family and friends because girl... never leave your family and friends for your man, fam and friends will always be there he may not as your seeing right now....|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You should put the phone back on. You shouldn't call him but you should answer if he calls. If he does act cool and happy. He will be wanting to come back more then.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	I think you are right not to talk to him but if I were you I would leave the phone on.  Then if he does call---he will know you are now ignoring him.  He is wrong to leave you like that without telling you anything and my suggestion would be to move on and forget about him.  Move home if you have to, if you can't handle it on your own or get a roomate or something.|`|tlxG2q04aa	Jesus Christ, he's only gone away to visit his family for a few days.  The universe does not revolve around you.|`|5MuTwO6naa	you so need to talk to someone like a friend or someone in your family.sounds like this guys pride as gone to,he if will not talk to you and treats you like a child then actions speak louder than words.pack up and go home or move into a smaller place that you can afford.you must act soon before you get yourself deeper into trouble.i really hope that you will be okay and sort this out for yourself,don't forget we are always here on this stupid "ask and answer" web site at anytime.best of luck honey.|`|AA11803994	Ok. First of all you need to ask yourself if this is the kind of relationship you want with a man. I know I certainly don't. I want a man who loves me and treats me with respect and has a job and works hard...that's who I married.<br>  Second of all, you need to realize that no one is holding you down. You aren't married to this guy and you don't have any kids with him - nothing to keep you where you are. If I were you, I'd change my phone number, pack my stuff and move home and never move in with a guy again until I really knew him and was planning on marrying him. <br>  This guy sounds like he's living two different lives and if he's angry because you ask him when he's coming back....then he is definitely NO GOOD FOR YOU...What man...if he loves a woman...gets mad when she asks when he's coming home? Set your standards high! If you don't ...surely no one else will.
twVyisGnaa	I'm kinda dealing with the same thing with a female friend of mine I'm madly in love with.  She's on break with her boyfriend, so a break-up is possible.<br>  <br>  Do what I'm trying to do.  Be a really awesome friend, and show them that you really do care for them.  I don't know.  Like I said, I'm dealing with the same issue.  Hope things work for both of us!<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|VZVGXRyraa	I started to get feelings for my best girl friend and i just out right told her that i really liked her and i wanted to see if there was more that could happen with us than just a friendship. That was 2 years ago. Now we're engaged to be married in a year and a half.<br>  <br>  If you have feelings for someone, don't waste your time and let someone else slip in and take your chance. Tell them how you feel and see what can be done.
vVka4ZA0aa	What can you do? Nothing.<br>  <br>  You might like the guy, but your friend who has known him for a longer period of time is now his girlfriend. He obviously likes her, which you said yourself "they both like each other." So, you can honestly just swallow your feelings and move on, because if you were the one he liked, he wouldn't be dating your friend.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Stay away.

So yes they do exist, it just takes some looking.|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	Sounds like you're too into looks than what really matters.  When you get over being shallow you'll be able to find the perfect guy inside, and he will look perfect to YOU on the outside.  That's all that matters.|`|6lSbmXunaa	I know someone. He's very goodlooking and he spends his Friday nights serving dinner to the elderly. He's also amazingly smart and does things for his church.|`|PyjZVn28aa	girl...i been thinking the samething for many years...i think when you find someone you love it doesnt matter if they are good looking..ofcourse its a plus...but it most likely wont matter...|`|9nTqx0sRaa	Right here lol|`|71EwzPSlaa	me!! lol

I can tell u from experience 5 months apart changed our relationship(but im positive u have a better relationship then i did). He changed, but he was also going through a rough time. We also where together 3 1/2 years... The fights are what killed it. Because u dont see each other everyday, little fights can last a lot longer. So take this advice. If its a little fight over the phone, no matter how steamed u are, don't go to bed angry. Make sure u both fix things before it tears you both apart. Ask your self, is this fight worth losing him? Hopefully he feels the same, and its not. Good luck

That shy-girl stuff really works on guys because it makes them feel like you aren't too over the top and all about yourself.  Just be you and that's obviously what he likes anyway.<br>  <br>  A good way to get over the conversational boundaries is to practice talking to him in your bathroom mirror.  Another good thing is to think about universal questions that will get him to do a lot of the talking and give you the opportunity to agree or disagree,  An example of this would be: "What did you always want to be when you grew up?".  This gives him the idea that you care to ask questions that are about him, are interested in the person he is, and also opens lines for communication.|`|FfyZE4Rsaa	hi my name is dr.phil and im gonna help you all this means is that you like this guy randy alot i dont know his name so lets call him randy ok deal with it. anywayz ya it will pass over time and just put out it wont be that awkward after i promise|`|7vwZlgMyaa	Im sure it will pass.

AjeNkvjlaa	yeah thats a good idea :P<br>  but why don't you want people to know your in a relationship?<br>  my advice would be to not do anything on facebook until friday eve<br>  so that she will think you haven't been online to change it yet, and she won't be offended! :)|`|w4UuCkQAaa	don't leave it, if you really like her you won't be ashamed of it.

Jv5xXYfvaa	Hi sweetie.  Out of your whole statement, what I get the most is that your "ex" is USING you.  He's using you to make himself feel good.  But when push comes to shove and he realizes that you are "real and in front of him" he gets nasty.<br>  <br>  You are using your old feelings for him as a crutch for excitement too.  It's time to get over him because it seems that not only is he abusing you, you're letting him.  If you feel the drama is exciting, however demoralizing it may be, then that's your own little turn-on.  But do your children and other half need the drama to spill over into their lives?  Because it does.  It really truly does, if you admit that to yourself.  Have you been cross with them or spiteful with him?  However unintentional, what you are ALLOWING to happen, your thoughts and actions, are hurtful to them in the short and long term.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a big favor and change your phone number to unlisted.  And then focus on your relationship with the man you're living with.  Go out with each other and NO kids.  Re-connect to him with purpose and love in your heart.  Because love is the only thing that will sooth your wounds and heal your heart. <br>  <br>  What really needs to happen is for you to realize this jerk-off ex NEVER loved you.  I was in a relationship with my ex for almost 7 years and he ended up marrying a woman from his country because his parents made him do it.  But then he called me out of the blue about 6 months later and said "Well, there's no reason we can't still be together since I don't love her..."  It was then that I realized he was a totally self-absorbed little misogynist who HAD NEVER loved me.  He couldn't have ever loved me if he was to suggest such a disreputable thing.<br>  <br>  It's the same with your ex.  If he EVER REALLY TRULY loved you he would respect you and cherish your memory.  Not USE you as a temporary "feel good" fix.  So, please realize that and just let him go for once and for all, okay?  You'll feel much better then.|`|utGddhnVaa	you have been severly emotionly beat the F**K up..start looking for a new guy|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	You are near tears when this dude calls because of the history you've had together.  That is normal.  But its been some years since you've seen him but you know how he is.  Its obvious that he hasn't changed.  He's disrespecting his relationship with the new g/f when he calls you.  Is your baby daddy as deceitful and disrespectful as the old b/f?  You have moved on now you have a family.  You be happy where you are and leave the old dude in the past.  You now have something positive to look forward to.  Are you sure you want to go back to being used and lied to all over again?  That is far too much stress to put yourself through again.|`|gRXy66dOaa	WOW.. i should get paid for reading all this...<br>  <br>  well first of all.. you said that he calls, now what im trying to figure out is how the heck does he know your phone number??<br>  Im pretty sure you gave him..<br>  how about you change your phone number so that he won't call you and you will never hear from him again<br>  <br>  move on with your life and don't look back|`|jgU4g6kGaa	You allow this loser to continue to manipulate you and your heart...he does it cuz you allow him to!! From what you described he treats you like a piece of crap disrespecting you over and over and you continue to stay with him or take him back.  He doesn't have respect for you or any other woman for that matter if he has another girl and is contacting you now.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to cut this guy off totally...no more phone calls don't give him the time of day he is a loser!  You are in a relationship with your childrens father focus on that and making that work don't waste any of your time or energy on this ex he is just trying to play you again and again! Forget about him!!

2SSD6BP9aa	Hand jobs are easier because uncut guys don't need lube.  Just make sure to pull the foreskin back before putting a condom on.<br>  <br>  The head of his penis will be more sensitive, so pay attention to that when giving him head.  Some uncut guys love it if you can slip the tip of your tongue under their foreskin, and swirl it around their head keeping it inside the foreskin.  But you may not be able to do that if his foreskin pulls back too far when he is erect.  If it still covers part of the head but you can't get your tongue under it, then see if you can pull it forward more.  If you can pull it forward enough to overhang the head, then you should be able to get your tongue under it.<br>  <br>  But don't worry if you can't do that.  He will still enjoy it even without that.  And some guys are just too sensitive for that anyway.<br>  <br>  I think you'll probably enjoy it if you give it a chance.  Most girls I have talked to who had both actually prefer uncut guys.  The ones who don't all had something against it from the start.  Like they thought it was weird or gross or something, and they never really gave it a chance.<br>  <br>  I'm uncut myself, and I prefer uncut guys.  (I'm gay obviously.)  I just wish there were more uncut guys around here!|`|7mCCAqXzaa	Nothing different you have the extra skin to use when giving a hand job it should work like any other unit <br>  <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|95gVLrIGaa	Handjobs are easier. You don't need lube.<br>  <br>  If you put the condom on him, pull his foreskin back first.<br>  <br>  Other than that, he's exactly the same.<br>  <br>  I've heard most women say that sex with an uncircumcised penis feels better. Using a condom you probably won't notice any difference since the foreskin won't move freely.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	It feels just the same, unless he is curved.|`|06O8FaOjaa	NOT REALLY IT FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME ITS JUS MORE SKIN ON THE TIP OF THE HEAD|`|EayT8T5Gaa	its the same thing!!|`|aImwLIqjaa	well for a start ir will feal different when they lick you out cuz they wont have a huge nose... CUZ THEY AINT JEWISH
Gl7tkWV7aa	She likes you enough to see you again. How did she act when you asked her? Did she seem excited, or hesitant to say yes?|`|qegWdsNLaa	Saying yes to a second date can mean several things.  The only thing you can count on it meaning for sure is that she's interested in seeing you again.  (Well, or she's just too chicken to say no, but probably she's interested in seeing you again.)  It's fair to be excited, but don't get *too* excited.<br>  <br>  As for reading the signs, I think what you need to focus on is the character of the person and your own personal character.  Don't date people who don't treat you well.  If you make yourself a doormat and keep taking it, then they'll keep doing it.  But if someone is caring, it won't even get to that first time.  So think less about mysterious signs and more about what makes a good person and what you can do to not be an enabler. Date someone caring and considerate, and be caring and consider yourself but don't let them abuse that.|`|c2rTAk71aa	don't stress too much. A 2nd date is a good sign. Just don't talk too much about your ex. Thats a drag and will make it seem like you aren't over her yet. Ask her a lot about herself and compliment her.
PXfUyd5aaa	It says she wants you for at least a little bit more than your penis.|`|Kh4QCRejaa	i think ur wife  was a real b***h but i think if you like this girl and she obviously likes you back, you are good! it is a very good cool sign that you landed the second date but after that is the big part! so you need to hold on to her if you think she's special! GO GO GO!|`|BLLdUrWVaa	because the girl probably likes you.<br>  <br>  think about it...<br>  <br>  if she didnt like you she wouldve made an excuse.|`|sm4FH7viaa	Maby it shows that she is interested and there is hope for you??|`|MOALoKWdaa	sure enough its a good sign, hopefully this one doesnt get away like the last one and doesnt do you wrong|`|4LunY702aa	2nd dates are a good sign but make sure you know her intentions before getting too excited. Meeting someone new is a good thing but i wouldn't count on having a relationship with someone you met at a club. But hey you never know. Good luck|`|7ZMilKYoaa	A second date means shes into you and wants to know more about you. So on a second date just be yourself, once again, so you can see if your into each other. This relationship could last :) (Oh and sorry about your first relationship, that's sad :( )|`|UajHxo3Daa	a 2nd date is a good sign. It means that she had fun on the 1st date and likes you enough to try again. Also a 2nd date means she is looking for more out of you than to just hook up.|`|JJMa25NWaa	Sure, a second date is a good sign! It means she had fun on the first date, she likes you, she wants to spend more time with you, and she wants to get to know you better.|`|fa4fwGuZaa	First off, if she accepted a second date from you, that most likely means that she had a good time and is interested in you. At least, she's interested enough to see you again. Looking back on your marriage and relationship, can you think of anything she said or any way she acted that maybe should have been a clue to her true character but you just didn't see it all the time? Girls are confusing; trust me, I know because I am one. But you have to calm down, think about the good time you had with her the first night, and maybe what she might like to do the second date. Be yourself and chill out, the first step to finding the right person is going to have to be to trust again. I know it's hard from experience. But look on the bright side; a second date is indeed a good sign!|`|jgU4g6kGaa	First of all sorry to hear about the all those years you wasted with a total B****!!!  Anyway, yes a second date is definitely a good sign. It means she enjoyed the first one and is happy to see you again.  Just take things really slow and get to know this girl if you really like her. Hopefully you will find happiness one day with a real woman who will appreciate you and what you have to offer to the relationship. Good Luck!!!|`|a1pmr73vaa	No,She just wants free dinner and a movie.
DcrI9zmkaa	Believe it or not, the world isn't coming to an end.  I'm 29 and have had only one serious relationship.  <br>  <br>  Not dating can be a good thing...it gives you time to become comfortable with yourself as a person.  Others can't like you until you like yourself.<br>  <br>  As for girls dating the "most annoying dudes"...the girls obviously don't agree with your assessment.<br>  <br>  Just be patient.  Forcing the issue will only make it worse.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	What you are doing wrong is comparing yourself to other people and trying to compete with them.  Don't worry about it dude.  They will all be divorced and you will be sitting pretty one day...  ;-)|`|0nVowEpXaa	when u become friends with a girl u like ask her out and take the risk|`|dx9msaNzaa	Girls date the worst guys when their young because their still learning what a nice guy is. Their experimenting, trying to discover what type of guys they like.<br>  <br>  Be patient, your time will come. Your young still, there's nothing wrong with being 15 and never having a girlfriend. Don't be in a rush to grow up, trust me, its not as great as you think it is.<br>  <br>  If you really want a girlfriend though you could always ask someone out. <br>  <br>  It sounds like some girl will be very lucky to have you.|`|xggSASTwaa	the most annoying guys are usually the most popular with the ladies. Who cares if they are talking about their ex's, call them lame and ask them if they have anything better to talk about. You will be dating in no time.|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	lots of guys don't have a gf at 15 ....And actually its better to have no girlfriend ..than to have an ex...Having an ex means the guy failed in his relationship...Where's the cool thing in that ?|`|rqeEhVvXaa	Its all a part of growing up,  your time will come|`|iNBte8Xoaa	Oh man, life is hard, but you know what, you just gotta know that it is for all of us!!!!<br>  Also, you seem to have the same problem as my brother does, what I tell him is, just FLIRT, what is the worst thing that can happen if you fail?!?!?!?!?!<br>  SHE LOSES YOU!!!!<br>  Try MSN, chat groups, or chatting in class is one of the biggest DO's when trying to get a girl, there is nothing like chatting, flirting, and adding the spice of danger to the situation, it works for everyone boy.<br>  Good luck, and do not feel bad if you are not doing it right the first times, I didn't become the rapper I am right now in 2 nights ok?<br>  <br>  So I am here for any other question you have, get numbers boy!!! get mails!!!! get GIRLS!!!!|`|jbPptRhlaa	You're not doing anything wrong. And girls don't like to be the ones who ask out people , so that means YOU need to make the first move. Flirt a little. and Gamble ALOT. When i say Gamble.. i mean to try and go for things you wuldn't have done..no matter the price.<br>  And Girls LIKE guys who have never had a boyfriend. <br>  I think it's cute, myself.<br>  Be yourself, and get out there.|`|U79z59QZaa	Maybe, because ur 2 nice.<br>  Maybe these days girls like u know "BAD BOYS."<br>  Boys who break the rules and don't kare about wastin' their life! Also maybe u r the one that has to open up to the girls, not them open up to you.<br>  Maybe they r having the same problem.<br>  Maybe they like u, but r afraid you don't like them.<br>  PS: I would so date u!  :P|`|oPYhUi8baa	I hate that feeling too. I'm fifteen and never had a boyfriend, though I've had offers. And your second statement I'll openly admit I'm one of those girls that like jerky guys. It's just they keep things interesting, well most do. One thing to be happy about is knowing that you're not the only single out there.<br>  (=|`|4Uf0PNq5aa	Don't be so in a hurry bud. <br>  Wouldn't it be great to tell the woman you spend the rest of your life with that she's the first? ;]|`|9q9McwwRaa	get out of the nice guy thing, your never getting any with nice guy image this is very important time if u lose now, it get worse later on 18 and up! don't get stuck in friendship prisons|`|oCxBeEI6aa	Annoying dudes are sexy, man!<br>  Here, let me give you some advice. <br>  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Well, like you said you're 15! So just have fun. The right girl will come along.|`|8WGxXA5vaa	Have you made an effort to ask a girl out?, there are many girls your age who feel the same as you, and are wondering how come that guy hasn't asked me out. <br>  <br>  Maybe approach the girl you know who is a bit quieter and you know is a nice girl and not the popular one, you know what they can be like..... Anyway just make conversation and after that ask here what she doing later and if she says not much then ask her out for lunch (outside school hours) maybe on the weekend and make sure your friends don't show up.That is very lame. Good luck and I'm sure you will find someone when the time is right. <br>  <br>  Oh another thing just because a girl might not be super attractive doesn't mean you can't go out with her. the point of dating is to date a variety of different people to gain confidence and experience so next time dating doesn't become scary and foreign.|`|m8Kv7FGJaa	You're 15.Don't worry about.You're just a kid, you shouldn't have to date.Trust me, you will want to go out and just have from move from person to person, and if you have a girlfriend that you love, it won't be possible and it can get annoying to be the one 15 year old that can't be with every person they want because of these commitments.Don't get committed to anything too soon.|`|jr2dpYKIaa	lol i agree with you on the fact that most girls do date the wrong guys who are really stupid && treat them like crap, and honestly thats cuz most girls ARE stupid lol, trust me i am one i would know. But dont worry so much about whether you've had a girlfriend or not, its really not that big a deal, you shouldnt date just cuz your friends have or do you know? date when you are ready and find the right girl she will come someday, try to keep your chin up kay??? you probly arent doing anything wrong at all its just most girls like bad boys and thats not the kinda guy you want to be, if girls dont like you because you are a nice guy then you dont want to be with them okay? Never change who you are cuz someone else wants you to.|`|4Q5OwgU8aa	i know you've probably heard this a million times, but you have to build your relationship!! If you want your first girlfriend to be a good one, get to know her first, then ask her out when you think you're ready, and her.<br>  <br>  and maybe, instead of feeling left out of the ex's conversations, you could learn from them. like what not to do, or what to look for in a girl. <br>  <br>  and in our defense, we don't know they're annoying until after we're dating them.<br>  <br>  hope it helps!!|`|2DKRF3qoaa	well, thats your first problem, you are 15.  If you was 18-29, and never had a girlfriend..,, you would need to check yourself.  But you are young, go out and be free!!! Have fun, play games, don't worried about the girls.... Let them come to you.  Thats the thing. I am single (By wanting it.) I am a good looking guy, but I too get shot down from time to time. But I don't let it get me down.  Yeah, it may make me heartbroken once and again. But I know that there is someone just for me out there. You just got to believe kid. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, and no one else.|`|2S0qGc20aa	I'm only fourteen.<br>  I started getting all these guys asking me out now and what not, I'm so foolish to have dated them and I regret dating them.<br>  They forced me into a lot of stuff and I would've loved to have just rather waited for the true love of my life to walk in.<br>  I honestly use to feel just like you when all my friends would be like so who's your boyfriend and how was your first kiss, etc...<br>  Because they thought I was that kind of girl and then when it all started happening I wish I didn't want things to speed up as much as I thought I did.<br>  If you catch my drift.|`|AA10197673	UR 15!!!! hav fun cuz now is the time to do it. trust me. dont worry about love yet. when yo get married you will have 60 or more years with em, so enjoy your singlelife while you can, no wife or ids to nag you or tear up your social life. why do you think people have bachelor parties?|`|abbf3f4adc5fcc5c6cbd88bbfaad3a4baa	Because these girls think that they can change this person for the better.  They need to grow up and realize that there are a lot of boys and men that are not worth the time or energy to date.|`|zsUT7gtpaa	Hmm....do you flirt?!?!  Very important in school. :P  also...talking on the computer, MSNing with girls from school will get you a girlfriend if your nice and help with there problems...have a go at it! :)|`|Io35X5kfaa	Well think to yourself, what makes you different then all of those other guys and find a girl that loves that about you..and make youself heard and not quiet..idk if you are or not though.|`|ajrfWt4paa	man who knows.

Maybe a life-long friend?<br>  <br>  They date dudes that are annoying because they usually look good.

People are so judgementle these days! I have learned not to let people judge you. It makes everything 10 times worse. It shouldn't matter if your friends like your other friends. I know how you feel about moving and transfering! I recently just moved from Michigan to Texas! It is hard to adjust but it takes time. It's what your heart says, to not be friends and listen to your other "friends", be her friend and tell your other "friends" you would rather take the chances or, be bossed around by the other girls and not be her friend. Personally I would be her friend and not let people boss you around! <br>  <br>  For the i love you part, when you talk to her in a chat room, just be like love ya like a sis! (when you are leaving) or just be like you are such a nice person and thanks for being there for me! and if she freaks out just say you are very thankful to have her!<br>  Good luck!|`|d5LRSguMaa	i did that about a week ago i just hinted at it lol|`|xUBmPeObaa	just tell her. really. x|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	How about a friendship card. make it a hallmark moment ;o)|`|HlOmfQBQaa	Tell her in a joke way and see how she reacts<br>  <br>  <br>  Or i could do it for you ;)

DlCcFu1eaa	Yes of course we do. As will you at some point in your life, probably during middle age and pre menopause when your hormones will get the better of you.<br>  <br>  What goes on in our head is simple raw stimulation. There's no romance or other complicated thoughts, just wow that's hot and we feel aroused. I point out to people who bring this up that stupid as it sounds guys can even get a little aroused by a cartoon. like Jasmine or Esmeralda from the Disney films. So it's not the actual girl as a person that we're attracted to, It's just a certain curve or movement. It's art. It touches some primitive part of our brains and triggers some hormone or something.<br>  <br>  Regarding your second question, I've been married 27 years and when that's happened to me I feel flattered but always say no and back off. Just looking is nice, anything more is trouble I don't want.<br>  <br>  So, it's kind of like supper coffee. A visual stimulant.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I look all the time, and so does my girlfriend (at guys and girls). Sometimes she points out hot girls for me to look at and we look together. <br>  <br>  If a hot girl came onto me I would say, "thank you but I have a girlfriend, so unless she can play too, I'm not interested"|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I used to look, much more when I was single. The question I used to ask myself was, even though she is really attractive, why was I not attracted to her? One of life's nicer mysteries ;-)<br>  <br>  When a 'hot' one makes an advance, I used to tell her I was flattered, but she wasn't my type. I consider it a compliment, and if a friendship forms from that, it's one based on respect.|`|k73IxCHaaa	The short answer is "yes". When a guy gets married he doesn't necessarily go blind. Newsflash, woman look also, there just more discreet than us dumb-*** men.<br>  <br>  And to answer your 2nd question, very few men can resist a really hot women. Acting on it, is a whole different story.|`|AA10092510	Men are human, sure we look and lust. The main thing is that he always keep respect for you.|`|AA11967247	sure, sometimes i help him scope out the good ones.|`|Ow5gSrAQaa	I don't have a problem for married or men in relationship looking except when it's a long star or a dirty look as if they want the girls to be naked.  now, if they were to check out other woman with you around, it's considered disrespectful for you and esp on him.  he is making a fool of himself.  they just have to know if a hot woman come on to them, they just have to resist the temptation and be thankful they go a fine woman already.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	All men look...it's part of their inner workings I think...LOL  The ones in a happy and loving relationship look as well, they just know not to touch or to cause a scene in the presents of their partner.  In fact both men and women "look" and I think we all see different things when we look...we're not all looking and thinking of "sex" or something like that.  Unless something out of the way is said from them looking...it's best not to go there with the conversation.  It only brings heartaches.|`|mCM363I9aa	of course they do, I'm in a happy marriage and I'm sure my husband does look at other women. However I think it's disrespectful and he will not do it in front of me but I'm sure he'll do it behind my back. Not to mention I also take a quick peek to other men but not in front of my hubby ;)|`|zezIM9B5aa	Yes, of course they look. My parents have been married 28 years. I recently went on vacation with my dad and I saw him checking some attractive women out. He was respectful about it, but it was obvious. I'm sure my husband "appreciates" the beauty of other women, too. I know I might check out a good looking dude for a second when I'm on my own.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It's normal to look as long as you don't touch and as for men if a hot babe came onto a guy 99% would go for it he she doesn't have be be hot for a guy to take her up on her offer.|`|ruczpWrGaa	Of course he does.  I completely expect him to.  He tries not to in front of me even tho i don't care.  he just feels bad about it.  And as far as a hot woman coming onto him.  Well its happened.  He walked away.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	My husband doesn't. He was taught by his father that looking at another woman and lusting after them is the same as committing adultery in your heart.|`|AA12095067	Of course, and so do women! We're married, not dead!|`|3O1EcmrGaa	Hate to admit this, but yes I do all the time.  I think in my case it's just a reflex reaction when you see something you are attracted to or that you want.  It doesn't even have to be another person, it can just be something I want like a fancy car, a cool HDTV, etc.  <br>  <br>  Men and women are attracted to other people who aren't their partner, whether they want to admit it or not.  I used to tell my ex, who accused me of rubbernecking all the time when a good-looking woman would walk by, that "am I the only guy in the world YOU are attracted to"?  Just because I may look doesn't mean I'm going to react on it, it's called self-control.  If I was happy with my current situation and a hot woman came onto me, I would probably just tell them I am taken but am flattered in their interest and if things were different I would have taken them up on their offer.|`|jeyLZLDGaa	Yes, men look.... but so do women (probably more often then men do)and we are quite a bit more critical then our men. <br>  <br>  What were to happen if a totally hot woman came on to your committed man???  If he is really a happy man in a loving relationship, he will be completely flattered (and maybe even brag to his guy friends about how awesome he is), but he will always come home to you.<br>  <br>  Love is an action (not a feeling).  If he loves you and If you love him.... it is a conscious choice, a decision that both of you must CHOOSE to make.|`|HdCo22Ggaa	Yes honestly i swear its like pure instinct but normally its just looks if they are in a happy relationship, you know once or twice you have looked at a guy and thought oh he is hot or something. now about the second one it really depends on the guy honestly if some guys thought they could get away with it they would go for it. others would either tell her to back off or quickly say i am taken something like woah woah woah i got a girlfriend|`|A5U4EgPJaa	Yes they look, my thinking it's I can always look too.  That is in their nature, so as long as he comes home with me I am alright.  Some times I even tell him, "hey look at that girl, she has a big butt".  Then he'll  look and make a comment.   I am very confident about my self, so if he ever decides to live me for any one, it will be his lost.   I know that he wasn't worthy of me and move on.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Yes we look. When I look I say in my head "Wow! She is Hot!". That is where it ends. I am happy with my Wife. Now as for what would happen if said Hot woman came on to me. Well nothing. Again I am happy. Just cause I look does not make me a cheating Dog!|`|hjpJZwLTaa	hunny . . . men not only look but the also touch . . . even ones in so called happy and loving relationships . . .  they are men . . . they love women . . . what more can I say . . .|`|EbUSYjLRaa	the same thing that would happen if a totally hot guy would walk by you.......look but don't touch. my wife points out hot chicks for me if i miss them and i do the same for her|`|KgM7p7ulaa	uyesssssssssssss
2ij4wwjgaa	as his girlfriend i think you have the right 2 look at his facebook the same way he has the right 2 look at urs<br>  but thats jus wat i think...<br>  on the other hand it depends on if you were jus LOOKING or if you were BEING NOSY or not trusting him...<br>  and 4 days is not a long time so wait a lil while<br>  he wouldnt jus give up 4 years 4 sumthing dumb like this|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	What you did probably told him that you do not trust him and a relationship without trust is not good.|`|hSY0LuCOaa	you snooped in his email and facebook? that's it? I think we need more info. did he give you his passwords? how did he find out you looked? what were you looking for? and most importantly why did you feel the need to look? it seems like an overreaction to break off a 4 yr relationship just for that. i'd be very angry, but not angry enough to to that. So maybe I don't know enough about the situation, or maybe he wanted to break up anyway and this was an excuse.
Gwi3uAqyaa	well if its your best friends birthday you should go and stick with her and she will/should defend you if they start to mouth of to you or whatever or just speek to her about it and explain why you do/dont want to go|`|jWPF6QR6aa	YER COURSE|`|fIq0qOePaa	well your best friend might want you to be there , and i think you should go , and just don't talk to the girls that are mean to you
atJOyPlwaa	how old are you? i mean is he really young? if he's not then this is inapropriate and you should tell a parent or guardian. its unacceptable for him to act in this manner especially to his sister. regardless of him being curious or whatever. tell somebody or you could risk it happening again.... please do. xxx|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Well how old is he ?<br>  <br>  omg thats scary<br>  <br>  tell your parents<br>  <br>  or tell your brother that thats gross !|`|AGaT3BDMaa	What r ur ages?|`|AA11585111	You should have told him just what it is..innapropriate!  and you should have someone check him to make sure no one is "touching" him!|`|3tnVVFjHaa	what is it your trying say.did you say stop or not.it sounds like your bragging.|`|0UZmS2mWaa	Well first of all are you atleast hot??|`|eYuIsNk1aa	slap him & tell him to get a girl friend|`|K6GXc6R6aa	it depends, how old is he? because if he is over 6 years old he should know better but if he is under 6 just tell him ''no'' don't do that any more and tell him to keep his hands to him self..oh and dont freak out too bad if he's under 6 because he's still learning things|`|3q7x0Zfwaa	If he is your "little" brother, let's say it is safe to assume you are the older sibling... Let him know that this is wrong and not something that siblings do. If you ar ehaveing trouble, you can involve your parents so they can teach your brother about it and maybe give him the "birds and the bees" talk.|`|Ak7Gk0uxaa	H-how old are you?<br>  <br>  Well first of all, tell your parents, and then tell him NOT to do that.<br>  If he asks why, say it's because you are RELATED...<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~EDIT~~<br>  <br>  Well definitely if he's 17, he should know alot better than to do that! But it's no different from this coming from a 8 year old, just tell your parents about it!|`|90ht2JH2aa	If your brother is 17 he's definitely old enough to know better.  You definitely need to let your parents know.  He shouldn't be touching any girl like that if she doesn't want to be touched, especially not his sister, and he may need counseling or something.|`|iwi7UvnAaa	maybe you should explain incest more clearly than he seems to know.<br>  It might seem harsh, but ignore him or stay away from him for a while to show that you don't want that sort of...thing|`|oE1eCjRtaa	Tell either your parents or someone you trust.|`|GQRs83Haaa	How old are you guys? And what you should've done is said STOP! <br>  Tell your parents and answer... how old are you both?|`|wpiWiWFiaa	You need to tell your parents, asap!|`|6a7UKZVAaa	Unless your some southern hick and he's your third cousin, this boy has no right to touch any part of you unless you say it's okay. This boy, if he really is as little as I think he is, doesn't really know what he's doing and he's trying things out and I'll bet he's using you to do that. You might not want to get him in trouble because he's your brother and he might not know what he's doing, and if it's his first time I think you should be assertive and explain that that wasn't okay and you'll tell your parents about it - or an adult you can trust. If he does it even ONE more time, tell your parents!|`|orpRTETWaa	I don' know if this is the answer you are looking for but here it goes. First of all how old are you and your brother? If you are very young, like very early teens you need to talk about this. There is still time to work this out so as not to be damaging to either of your sexual futures. At this age sexual urges can get confused and may end up in inappropriate behaviors. Talking this out will help him to understand that what he is doing is wrong. Second is if your are older teens or older yet. There is not much to talk about because you are both old enough to know that this is incest. This will never be good for you because you already see something wrong with this as  you are writing this letter. Your brother, on the other hand, knows better also and decided to initiate this encounter anyway. My opinion he needs help and not the kind you can give him. You really need to say NO! if he persues you again. I hop I was some help to you.|`|RdvIeImfaa	how old is he? because he might just be at a curious age and doesnt really understand the implications behind that sort of touching just knows that it felt good when he touched that area of himself. If he is just a young boy i thnk you forgive him and just tell him thats not appropriate. If hes older than like...i dunno 8/9 maybe older even..am not sure exactly when boys understand stuff like that... then just ask him what the hell he was thinking? tell him you dont ever want thim to touch you there. And i suggest you maybe talk to your parents get them to talk to him.|`|ayNhwPY3aa	That is a sign that someone is difintely molesting him.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your parents as soon as possible. If they do not listen, you need to keep telling adults/counselors until someone listens to you. <br>  <br>  Your brother has been sexually abused and is now acting out. <br>  <br>  Tell an adult. <br>  <br>  If he does it again, slap his hand gently and then explain to him that no one should ever touch another person in that way. Tell him how wrong it it.|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	ACK!  I AM a parent and I would really want to know if something like that had gone on!  You need to tell your parents!  It doesn't matter what your ages are!  TELL YOUR PARENTS!  Your little brother needs to know that what he has done is not ok and will not be tolerated.  And if he is a young child, I bet your mom would like to know where he learned something like that to begin with!  Eep!|`|JdeNnTYhaa	Tell your folks, like, NOW!|`|4L6FFR3zaa	TELL AN ADULT IMMEDIATLY!!!!! do NOT keep this a secret! tell ur parents or ur school councler. just tell someone!!!!!!
2ij4wwjgaa	i think she is asking the same question u are...<br>  she wants to talk to you but doesnt know if u like her<br>  u jus needa be up front with her and ask<br>  cuz i think you are waisting time <br>  if she likes you then yall should start talkin ASAP|`|d4cukr5waa	Sounds like it is i guess, I guess she is shy because of what you said, but maybe wait a bit longer and see where it goes naturally?
u8HYfTnyaa	we all suffer, the very best thing you can do it have a mutual friend let her know that you like her, or have him fine out if she likes you. that way you don't seem like an odd one. What i did was get her number. once your conversations get to be longer than an hour ar so (on average) you should talk about feelings etc. then let her know how you feel. the worst thing she can say is "no"|`|LSWnwRjEaa	get some mates to ask her or her friends if she likes you or if she would ever go out with you.<br>  <br>  try to buy her little things like birthday pressies and shizzle like that.<br>  <br>  get noticed, try to make her laugh, just because its really nice when you make a girl smile<br>  <br>  if she does then just ask her.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Maybe ask for her number?<br>  And ask her to go out sometime through texting??|`|iwE1QRKdaa	maybe ask if she wants to meet up at the weekend, go into lunch with her?<br>  answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjn_Cz.YevtvDTIKdSCg_8gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223131151AAdGweq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
AA11150213	At this point is shouldn't matter whether he texts you back or not.<br>  <br>  He told you that he still has feeling for his ex, don't waste you time move on. You waiting around for his texts just seems like an excuse to talk to him and that's only going to stop you from moving on and meeting someone who really wants to be with you.
c1334d7d6d160918eed9551c6f52e61baa	You are NOT blowing this out of proportion. <br>  You are not wrong for not talking to him anymore<br>  Be glad you found all of this out before you married him. <br>  Why the hell would he put his daughter's "middle name" and not her first name on his arm????(scratching head) That would have been a red flag for me.As I am sure it was for you <br>  Be glad you dumped him because if he really loved you he would have been honest from the get go and could have easily explained it as mistake(s) from the past.<br>  It is ALWAYS harder to cover up that it is to just be honest.<br>  All you can do is hope he learned and doesn't repeat history with someonelse.|`|srNze5uIaa	The best thing you'll ever do is to leave him completely.<br>  Don't waste your time like this with a man who is not reliable. Not only does he lie, but he also cheats on you.<br>  <br>  Stop this relationship, and find yourself someone who have some more principles.|`|bsIGWtGaaa	I think you have a right to  not want to talk to him. I HATE liers. Its just not nice. He, and im not trying to be mean, is definatly cheating. <br>  Sorry but there are like, bazilions of nice guys out there that wont cheat on you|`|30fa08e363c568e7e3abec37751a23d2aa	Wake up, girl!

Of course you are right to not want to talk to him.  If you don't have honesty then you have nothing.  I think that this man has a serious problem if he lies to you this much.  Especially about the small insignificate things.  He might have some sort of disorder or something.  Either way there is no way for you to help him.  You should dump him and move on.  My motto in life is people treat you how you allow them to treat you.  Another words if you allow someone to treat you like crap they will.  I hope this helps.  Please dump him and find someone who deserves you.|`|AA10873763	Leave.|`|1l04qpOKaa	He has something to hide, liars believe what they say is true. He's sketchy, I'd get rid of him asap!

qegWdsNLaa	Move on.  If she was unhappy, then before she broke up with you, you could have worked on the relationship, found out where she was unhappy, and tried to be better for her.  However, now that she's broken up with you, trying to pursue her now is called "stalking", and it's bad.  If she changes her mind, then that's her choice and she'll have to approach you.|`|htpxHZTPaa	Wow....<br>  If you read my question you would know why i said wow. <br>  <br>  But as for your question. If you think she likes you write her something telling her how you feel.

giDhTBoAaa	Talking to her friends can definitely get you closer to her. Also, try to be humor-filled around her, since most girls like guys who have a sense of humor. If you have a chance to work with a partner in a class, ask her if she wants to work together. Just do whatever you can to talk to her a bit. Just try and give her some space though. Good luck, homeskillet.|`|BEpTEb0Naa	talk to her on face book, and ask her for her number .. say something like "we should hang out sometime, whats your number?" or something. or even in person would be better. then once you get her number if you both have cells, you can text her and get to know each other better.|`|VZ14JElBaa	Just talk to her, she may like you, POPULARITY IS NOT A EXCUSE!<br>  <br>  Seriously, i had the same situation once

I am a women and I believe in trusting your man until he gives you reason not to trust him.  But I also believe if you allow a man to take advantage of you, they will..because you allowed it.  You have to let people know that you will NOT be taken for granted and your husband needs to keep his *** at home or take you with him.  Maybe not all the time but, well you know what I mean...I hope!|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Sometimes as a Friend you have to watch your friends do what you consider collasal Fck ups.

He may have gotten to that point and just can't watch what he perceives as a Train Wreck happening.
4vLt3SqFaa	Only very young or very immature men would care.  It is not the wrapping of the present that counts but what is on the inside.

3iNobwVraa	You sound like a great guy, and your other question was extremely mature.  Either you are someone whose maturity is far beyond your peer group, or maybe you date/be-friend girls in their early twenties.  If you are beyond your peer group, don't fret, there are always a few others, you just need to find someone like-minded.  <br>  <br>  Among mature (over 25!), non-shallow people, there always comes a point where you start feeling drawn to the strength of character and mind.  The shallow stuff still matters lol, but the strengths you possess will definitely cause you to stand out from the crowd.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, and don't spend too much time with the shallow folks.  They are never great company for more than a second (because a shiny logo catches their eye, and they start drooling!)  Silly, brainwashed nincompoops, imo.  Yeah, I said nincompoop, so?!  Old words, much like B*tches, are the new black!  (no credit for me.

7PpbCP9taa	My girlfriend does this all the time.

If this is something you are interested in...good for you...if not, move on.  <br>  <br>  Finally, you snooped....you found something you didn't like.  She has the right to be defensive.

yuBuNoPDaa	Men also gain weight too. Your metabolism slows down and people's habits get worse as they get older or so it seems. I think it's we have less time for physical activity. Many people are working longer hours - something has to give. Instead of eating less, we might eat more because we have to eat faster than we should. We just don't have the time to take care of ourselves. <br>  <br>  What are we living for? What's the purpose of life? Enjoy when you die?<br>  <br>  I have actually lost weight since high school.

w9f1EPLZaa	Well....make sure you dress nice:) a nice american t-shirt or button up shirt always looks good:) Bring some gum or mints:) You go pick her up or just meet her there if you don't drive yet. Then, you pay for her ticket..but i hope you knew that already.:) haha ask her if she wants any popcorn or pop when ou get inside...if so get a big one you both can share.:) then...when you get in the movie put the middle armrest up between you. when the movie starts put ure arm around her or try to hold her hand.:) afterwards...if she seems into you at the end of the night..kiss her. but thats up to you...you have to decide if its right.:) good luck.|`|DlW1u90iaa	hold her hand. and after its over talk to her and hug her but dont kiss her this date wait till the next maybe.|`|Rf515Ednaa	you should hold her hand, and maybe if its a romantic movie and you two get eye contact for more than like five seconds go in for the kiss man! GOOD LUCK! HAVE FUN!|`|LxZFioqwaa	Popcorn, romantic film, back row, wear an extra jacket to give her, brings lots of cash.<br>  <br>  Make sure its just you 2.

kGBli717aa	I take it he's military. You should call him often, send him pictures of you, your pets, whatever you think he'd like. Send by mail little gifts, romantic cards with loving words from you. Keep the romance going. Keep reminding him you miss him, but don't make him feel guilty for being gone, big romance killer. See if there is anyway one of you can travel after a few months to see the other. Good for you for being supportive, he is a lucky guy.|`|62TvIinPaa	Dear,<br>  This might help u... Go for a nice picnic  before his tour. Have some snaps and videos taken. Exchange remembrance gifts. These'll help u feel relly close to him despite of miles between u two.<br>  <br>  Keep in touch online and hang on phones. Make sure u dont disturb his work :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck,
rCOq9Sr1aa	Honey, it IS easier said than done.  But it needs to be done.  Find a friend who is willing to help.  Someone who will let you stay there for a while or SOMEthing.  Find yourself somewhere to go.  If it's money that keeps you there, I get that.  I was ther once.  When money is tight, it's hard to go.  I found another place to go and hid money and walked on eggshells around him until I had enough to leave and have a good start for finding a new place to live.  And it's not just the money, either.  I know that, too.  Even in a short period of time, you can feel so invested in another person and don't want to feel like a failure.  If that is an issue for you, forget it!  If he's hitting you HE has failed, not you.  Sister you need to run.  Make a plan, stick to it and GO.  No one ever has the right to hit you.  EVER.  <br>  In the meantime, put ice on your mouth to ease the swelling, there's little else you can do on that one. =(|`|wKVhHHV5aa	Yes i know that its easier said then done, but look at it this way, would you want your son to be hitting on other females? You are a woman, you should be respected in every way. You hear others tell you to get  out of the relationship, but yet your thinking he's going to change, thinking he'll change for you. But in reality he dosen't unless he gets a rude awakening. I was in something like that. ME and my boyfriend of two years moved in and at first it was cool, then the little hits came in and thats when i decided to leave. Its hard to see the big picture when your in it. At least give it a break, go to a relitives house and just hang there for a while. Don't worrie he'll be knockin on that door. <br>  <br>  and as for the braces, i also had them and Campho Phenicq always worked wonders for me. <br>  <br>  good luckk|`|yjliGiRmaa	OH HELL NO!! Ain't No man gonna hit me u need to take ur self and start steppin girl ur crazy if u let him hit u there r other fish in the sea sweetie u just need to throw that one back and find one that will treat u like a godess i know it would be hard but step and down look back cause next time it might not be ur mouth it might be u in an alley but u might not think he would do something like that but rage can over power someone dont stick around to find out leave an go to a friend or family that u trust out of town is were i would go dont tell him anything but dont stay.|`|1oNZKc9Kaa	I know what your going through my bestfriend of 5 years went through a very similar situation and she is no longer with us due to domestic violence. (rip christina) and if you dont get out now it might be to late. Dont sit around and think that you can help change him and make him see that what he is doing is wrong. Odds are your not the only girl he has done this to and he wont stop until HE is ready and HE relizes he needs help. You cant force him and PLEASE dont put your life at risk trying to fix something that is not your job to fix or save a relationship thats not meant to be saved. It was only your lip this time but next time it could be worst......(DONT LET THERE BE A NEXT TIME). As far as your lip get some peroxide and clean it because you dont want infection and make sure you keep ice applied to it. it will deffintly help the swelling..........Good Luck : )|`|CGlDAvkAaa	You really need to leave this guy. he has no respect for you or himself cause if he did , he'd never hit you or any other woman. Why are you with him anyway? There are plenty of other guys that would love to be with you and treat you better than this loser your with. personally, i'd press charges of assault on the creep.Since your lip is swollen you have plenty of proof to stand up in court with. teach the creep a lesson. Put ice on your mouth so the swelling can go down. Don;t be afraid of the jerk when you leave either, they're always alot of talk, they'll find someone else they can push around. I've been there, I know. Get out now!|`|IdY8lmMfaa	leave duh no one should be hitting you i kno wat it feels like to get hit in the mouth but i don have braces but foreal GET OUT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3gohxp2Iaa	WITH OUT A DOUBT!

You need to have a plan first...Start saving all your money the best you can...even as him for a few dollars here and there...plan your date of escape...when you have enough money to move on....just roll out!!! you dont need no boy like that in your life...I bet he thinks he is a man to!!! what a coward to have to hit a woman!!! wow I am mad!!! but just leave...so you dont have to ask these questions on how to heal your lips...for you will find a man who wont hit you!!! and you will be asking how to get this man to marry you!!!|`|YrMRlWzyaa	Please don't do this to yourself, you're young and in love but obviously he's not because you don't hit someone you love. Forget about your braces, if you're finding it hard to leave then please tell someone close, you need to get out of the relationship before he does something neither of you can fix.|`|RdvIeImfaa	my advice is leave him. I know its hard cz you love him and everything but he is no good for you. You will end up depressed and traumatized. Me like that always say they will change but they never do. It may not be the first time he's hit you, but make it the last. Dont let someone do that to you, no matter how apologetic they may be later.|`|J8XL3u7aaa	no its eazy to do than say i watched a FIRST 48 show u know the show on real murders and this guy was like your boyfriend and the girl went  missin and finaly the guy ended up telling them what he did she was laying in the woods nexed to trees beat up dead with a blanket over her dont be the victom of this but just put ice packs or ice on it and it bout a week ull be back to normal but leave this relationship cause if i was there id knock that idiot out tell him step to a real man|`|OQSbuQrxaa	leave. ask your family for advise.|`|AA10961492	Just leave him.

I sure know I would want him. I would leave him the first time he did that, no matter how hard it is I WOULD LEAVE. You should too :)|`|90ht2JH2aa	Get out of there. he shouldn't have ever hit you in the first place and especially not more than once.  suggest he get counseling and get the crap out before you get really hurt.|`|IAlFjGwUaa	tell me where u live and who ur bf is and then we will see who has the busted up mouth. he is a ******* low life. guys like him should die. honestly sre if this hurts your feelings. you deserve someone way better.|`|F7DxOnJkaa	yes your right you do need to leave him but i know its hard to do uhm...try a bag of ice? and advil or something for the headache|`|AA10873763	The braces have nothing to do with it.  You know you need to get out.<br>  <br>  Ice packs will help the swelling.  Good luck.|`|LELGscJFaa	his wifey.. maybe get some counseling on abusive relationships...<br>  <br>  it really is a bad cycle:<br>  <br>  he'll tell you you're not good enough for anyone else (wrong)<br>  when you leave, he'll treat you really well for a bit and say he'll never do it again (wrong)<br>  <br>  Hopefully you won't go back.  That's where the counseling comes in.<br>  <br>  Try not to be intimidated... think of it as a long term investment in yourself... the choice to "rip the bandaid off" right now will make you a lot happier down the road.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I don't have other advice than that...<br>  <br>  GL|`|xJBJn6dOaa	forget the braces.... get out of that relationship! NO ONE should be hitting you, especially the one you live with/love.|`|urGXKo7Raa	I'm only telling you this one time LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if he hits you again then call the police and sue his sorry ***.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|L44LBa2Xaa	I believe you shouldn't be worried about your mouth right now - you should be more worried about WHEN TO LEAVE.<br>  No one should hit their loves on.<br>  I know it's easier said than done...but really, if you keep on staying in this relationship, he can really badly injury you.<br>  If he's hitting you for the stupid reasons - imagine if you fight about something insanely HUGE.  You well want to get out of this IMMEDIATELY.|`|dbQHlp85aa	I would love to give you advice but you wouldn't listen.. leaving is not easier said than done.. you have no children with this sorry excuse for a man.. so why can't you leave. <br>  <br>  To hell with him.. unless you like being his punching bag.|`|37M3dkkRaa	well you'll have to just wait for your mouth to heal, you can put ice on your lip to help the swelling. but you need to really leave, and i know its easier said than done, but you need to respect yourself and realize that theres no excuse for you to have to deal with ANYONE hitting you. its just wrong, and you're better than that. i KNOW that if you leave now, you'll realize that it's better than getting hit and you'll be alot happier, even though it may take a little while. please just take care of yourself and get out of the relationship and away from that guy.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Why you said that leaving him is "easier said than done"??? You know you have to! I feel sorry for you! Good luck!|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	Everything is easier said that done.  As for your mouth, ice keeps the swelling down.  This sounds like abuse.  Not cool, at all.  No matter what it is you do, or how he feels, you have no reason to be hit in any way.  How long has this been going on?  Sweetheart, you have to get out.  Its not worth it if he hits you.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	is his name chris brown|`|htpxHZTPaa	Girl seriously leave he has NO right to hit you seriously! <br>  <br>  And i don't know just eat some icecream and put ice on it....<br>  I'm sorry but really you need to leave before he starts breaking your bones in rage over stupid stuff.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|67ThRN4Taa	I'm afraid that I have nothing original or profound to say:  you should leave him *immediately*.

The very best of luck to you.|`|PyjZVn28aa	are you for real.....get the **** out of there....if he keeps doing it and he really loves you do you think he would hit YOU....he could atleast hit the wall or slam the door or something...but not you...you are crazy...what are you thinking...|`|pppCE90Naa	i got told my father that no man should get hit us because my dad told me if my boyfriend hits me i have to go to him And my dad told me that i will have to call the cops if a guys hits me|`|4VIjILk1aa	You need to leave him. You wont leave because you love him, What's there to love? He say's he loves you but he puts his hands on you. He doesn't love you. He doesn't care how you feel. He keeps hitting and leaving marks on you, soon it could be much worse. Don't put yourself through pain anymore. There are guys out there that will treat you with respect and not lay a hand on you. Don't ever let a guy make you feel like you can't get anybody. Now with the swelling put so ice on it and go to the police station a file a report on him.|`|7NqIVXIlaa	For you lip put some ice on it. It will help with the swelling. Also you need to leave that loser right know. He had or has no right to hit you. Do you have family you can go and stay with or some friends. If you need to talk to someone please feel free to email my ex boyfriend use to hit me so i know how you feel.|`|UkTuev4yaa	Leave him. It will only get worse. It starts with a fat lip, and ends with a broken neck or getting shot or stabbed to death.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Throw the a hole in jail , no one , no on3 should ever hit a lady . I hope you feel better , soon .|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	Girl, I know it is easier said than done,, but come on now, do you really deserve to be hit for any reason?   God didn't put women on earth to be a punching bag for men.<br>  If you have a brother, dad, friend, who will knock some sense into this guy, tell them.<br>  Let him be the one getting punched!  And, leave his a**.  You and every other abused woman deserves better.  I dont understand why any woman would let a man hit her more than once.<br>  The only man who ever hit me, went to jail before my lip started swelling!   That's the way we roll here in the mountains.  Men dont hit women!|`|U0WMFNC3aa	easier said than done? are you kidding me? your parents might have to go to your funeral if this continues.|`|bEaJHY1uaa	leave him... and u didnt didnt write this for info about ur mouth u wanted ppl to know allll about your boyfriend beating on you yea its easier said then done but he shouldnt be hitting you dont be stupid dump his @ss|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	If he hits you he will hit your children, please oh please dont get pregnant. if he injures your braces all that time and money you have invested wearing them it will be for nothing and you will have to pay extra to get them fix everytime.

And the sooner the better.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	k. first of all, i'll help u with the braces thing. put glycerin on  ur lip or where it got cut. if not then just put ice on it and sap it with cold water. if u broke a bracket, go to the orthodontist to fix it. as for that stupid bf of yours, you REALLY need to get rid of him. unless u want to get even more damaged. let him know that you will call the police if he does it again. <br>  <br>  PLEASE do that and DON'T let him hit u again.|`|JivLAZH6aa	you need a man lady not a chump|`|388660290dcd55182aaaa6771b8ac972aa	i would never want to stay with someone that doesnt respect me! all the love vanishes in this situation!

The other 10% is preference. It is different from person to person. You like what you like. And just because you're not attracted to a certain race does NOT mean you are racist.|`|k5Dx1MfWaa	Steven S. We are out of the dark ages, and have been for years. It's time everyone wakes up to that fact. It's like believing in God lets  draw a line in the sand, and all those who don't believe and feels that it does stay on one side, and those who do believe and don't  think it matters stay on the other side, because when we get to heaven there is no difference in Gods eyes just like it should be here. Good Luck! Isn't there enough hatred, and dis-respect in the world already with out making more?|`|KIKUBbT6aa	It is mostly how one is raised.  Having an interracial relationship and having children from that relationship is seeing a decline in the pure cultures and race.  Biracial is more common than being of one race anymore.  Does it seem sad that we might be loosing our "cultures" to biracial relationships?  Something to think about.|`|2KC467tFaa	I don't think it matters as long as the two people are in love. I would be happy for them because many people will go through their whole lives and never feel true love. I think the more closed-minded people are, the more limitations they are putting on themselves.|`|y8DLyE5raa	We have no right to judge someone if they want to be in an interracial relationship.  Whatever floats your boat.|`|haWw3B8aaa	The united states has been doing this for over 200 years.<br>  You would not believe the controversy between the cultures of the English and the Irish.Let alone all the others in that time(Polish,French,Spaniard,Swedish,Nati...

Stop relying on him for all the romance. A relationship doesn't work if one person puts in more effort than the other.<br>  By NOT calling you, he is trying to get YOU to call HIM.<br>  Sounds to me like your man wants a bit more romance. I would shape up before another woman sweeps him off his feet.|`|7edl5u1oaa	Pretend like you are going to break up with him and if he doesn't step up to the plate, then i guess just let him go.

eVEUOGF4aa	Hi buddy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Charm is the art of having an attractive personality. This characteristic can only be achieved over a period of time. While everyone is born with differing amounts of natural charm, much can be acquired and honed through practice and patience. As with dancing, the more you practice, the better you will become. Effort and careful attention to the needs and desires of others will ensure that charm becomes a permanent part of your character.<br>  <br>  1. Improve your posture. Good posture will give the impression of self confidence (even if you don't feel that way on the inside). While walking, maintain a relaxed yet definitive upright posture: spine long, shoulders back, head level with the ground. This may feel awkward or overpowering to you when you first practice it, but keep trying. <br>  <br>  2. Relax the muscles in your face to the point where you have a natural, pleasant expression permanently engraved there. Face the world and show everyone you're not afraid. <br>  <br>  3. Make a connection. When your eyes come in contact with another person's, nod and smile subtly with a subdued joy shining forth. Don't worry about the other person's reaction and don't overdo it. <br>  <br>  4. Remember people's names when you meet them for the first time. This takes an enormous amount of effort for most people. Repeat the person's name when stating your name to that person will help you to remember it better. For example: "Hi Jack, I'm Wendy." Follow through with small talk and repeat the person's name. Repeat it once more when you say goodbye. It's not just about helping you to remember that person. The more you say a person's name, the more that person will feel that you like them and the greater the chance they'll warm up to you. Write it down somewhere. i.e. Diary. <br>  <br>  5. Be interested in people. If you meet a new acquaintance, for example a co-worker, a classmate, a friend of a friend, etc. find out about their immediate family and interests. Be sure to ask after the names of family members and remember them. Be careful in that subject though you don't want to be nosy. If you ask too much they will become uncomfortable. Also ask after their particular interests in life. These two topics will ensure much better small talk than just harping on about school or work. Most people don't like to think about those things at social occasions unless they have to. Even if it is about networking, you should understand fully the worth of taking a break from talking shop. It is important to refrain from talking up about yourself. Be purely interested and impressed by the person with whom you are speaking. <br>  <br>  6. Orient topics toward the audience. This means taking into account topics that interest those around you, even if you are not so keen on them. If you are in a sporty crowd, talk about last night's game or the meteoric rise of a new team. If you are amongst a group of hobbyists, draw out their hobbies and make remarks related to fishing, knitting, mountain climbing, movies, etc. Nobody expects you to be an expert.<br>  <br>  7. Don't Lie. A lie is something you say for which there is some direct evidence somewhere out there that contradicts it. If you tell Mary that you like Jane and Billy that you don't like Jane, Mary and Billy will talk and your reputation will be ruined. No one will believe a word you say. <br>  <br>  8. Be gracious in accepting compliments.<br>  <br>  9. Control your tone of voice. The tone of your voice is crucial. Voice should be gentle and peaceful. Think about it, is someone who yells attractive? <br>  <br>  10. Smile with teeth it is an opening gesture and more friendly than smiling with a closed mouth.<br>  <br>  11. Don't complain about events in your day, discuss the highlights of your day! Nobody wants to hear how much your day sucked, and it will only make you seem like a depressed and pessimistic person. But at the same time, be sure not to brag about your day, you'll be seen as arrogant.<br>  <br>  12. Appearance must be clean and neat This is the base of all beauty and charm. No one will find you attractive if you smell bad or look messy. Dress how you want to from emo to skater to pretty and classy, you can be proper and still have a style.|`|aeee4f0cd8f8b54cba0e6fac9a771ebdaa	Well Charming and getting a girl to like you are two very different things.<br>  Charming might seem too goody goody to a girl at first, but if shes really into you it doesnt matter.<br>  Dropping by when she doesn expect you, flowers, one liners|`|qms67wSWaa	be like Edward Cullen !!!

37M3dkkRaa	if thats what she wanted, she wouldn't be with you anyway. she just likes you for who you are, not all girls like the muscular jock types, i know i hate guys with huge muscles. so no, she probably won't be turned after when you start having sex with her, if she is you'll know it anyway.|`|BnistnrIaa	should of posted pic but if she's willing to kiss ya i don't see why not|`|WWcP6WNCaa	every girl likes different types of guy. she must have seen something in you she likes. surely from looking at you with clothes on she can see that you are 'kinda skinny' as you say, its not all about looks anyway. speaking from my own personal experience if i like a guy then his body, muscles etc does not come into it. if you like someone then you find them sexy no matter what they look like. i would bet that you are worrying over this when you have no need to. you should be confident and feel sexy within in your own body and i'm guessing your having a panic attack over nothing.|`|DwTTt628aa	nope! not me anyway once you like someone its hard to stop over something stupid like your body once you get older things like that dont seem to matter as much, just enjoy yourself
UjajMHH4aa	talk to him about it. tell him that though you have a lot of past history together his friendship means a lot to you and you would really love to share something like this with him. Also explain to him that you want your date to look awesome in the photos, and thats why you picked him :)<br>  <br>  don't worry about the ex thing, if you are still as good friends as you sound like then he won't mind. <br>  <br>  good luck

7YTiooX5aa	everyone needs and deserves time away from one another, he's just amd cause you were the one who went out. he's just controlling and wants you to be like his ex|`|LELGscJFaa	U gotta either get this dude to realize things are different with you, or tell him it's time to live apart again...<br>  <br>  It may be old emotions popping up, but u gotta lay it on the line and tell him, "I'm not her, and I need my free time when I want it.  Don't feel like you need to stay home, and do not make me feel guilty for having my own life."<br>  <br>  Also, make sure your free time is not to spite him, but just to get your head straight.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't like that, it's a sign of "time to go"-ish-ness ;)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You shouldn't feel guilty about anything but your son should mean more to you than this guy ever should.|`|KJAKihaCaa	no offense but he kinda sounds like a jerk. He was just in a bad mood cause he was bored all day and had to sit at home while you were out having fun for once. Don't feel guilty just let him sulk. He needs to get used to being bored if he wants any relationship to ever work. It's 2009 not 1909. Women need to have a life now too|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Don't be worried about him. You are allowed to have friends and you are allowed to go out with them. Don't be controlled by him. He is just using tactics to control you. If he throws an attitude just say that I was with my girlfriends and I had fun. Am I not allowed to have fun? If he says no then he is definitely not any good for you. You deserve better.|`|4WXK187vaa	SB,<br>  <br>  The question is...did you discuss these feelings with your boyfriend before just going out? You are now in a committed relationship. He is on one page, you on another page. <br>   <br>  I have a friend that 'used' me once...oh let's go out as a girls night out thing...okay, fine...we did...I found out later she just wanted to get away from her new live in boyfriend to go out and flirt with other guys at the local club. <br>  <br>  Yet, there are a couple of times I might go out with a few of my girl cousins...all innocent...dinner, a movie, girl talk. This is fun and we re-connect. <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that you can be together ALL the time under the same roof and not be in each others private space 24/7. My bf moved in with me 5 months ago and he has his computer game time...I will do other things around the house.<br>  <br>  I will still approach him and nibble on his ear and he will at times come over and give a special hug when I am doing the dishes. Intimacy is a nice thing to learn to manage. <br>  <br>  I think you got home at a very reasonable time and that if it is just to chat and have dinner or see a girlie movie, shopping etc it is just fine. Maybe your bf can go out with his guy friends those nights as well.<br>  <br>  This situation happened for a reason, he learned a lesson here...he use to do this to his ex. and now the shoe is on the other foot. It could be called 'karma'. <br>  <br>  Communication is the key here...and compromise on a solution that benefits both of you! Good Luck<br>  <br>  Mystified|`|x5Vjrxdfaa	i think that you should leave this guy ASAP. he is acting like an *** hole. If he thinks your messing around, then he probobly is. also your life shouldn't revolve around him. you should be able to hang out with your freinds and make your own descisions. Also, this is not a good role model for your son.|`|n2P9vD1eaa	Don't feel guilty in the least bit. In every relationship, you need time to yourself, and time with your friends. And he needs to respect that. If he doesn't, that's his fault. Talk to him about it, let him know that you deserve more respect.|`|AldevmIhaa	no you should not feel bad. if you have bim spending hel;la time with him then you have he right to go out and get away sometimes. he needs to grow up and realize that things are not going to go his way... tell him to get a life|`|DNCpCjqjaa	I don't know if it's so much of a control issue as him feeling left out...maybe on nights you go out with your girlfriends tell him so he can make plans to do something with his friends...he probably feels hurt you would rather spend an evening with your friends than with him.|`|dzbblpjgaa	I hear an early warning siren!<br>  Read some articles on controlling personalities and passive aggressive types. <br>  He sounds as if he is a controller. My main question would be not if he is good for you long term, but his influence on your son. Sorry to be harsh! :/|`|AA11685201	yes, very controlling. get away bc it could escalate.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	He is controlling.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	enjoy yourself .....dump him and get a real man if doesn't  want to be alone tell him to take u out|`|BEpTEb0Naa	he was probably just bored while you were gone, and was thinking about you having fun without him. i think it kinda is a control thing but it wasn't like he told you you can't go out anymore.. and tell him you both get to do that sometimes. i would not feel guilty though. but say sorry just to make him happy.
m7fWJTASaa	Dont freak out, ive been in the same situation. Dont be shy, if you like him ask him out to the movies, bowling etc..something fun, if you just wait and see time is going to pass and he is going to move on. talk to him about it and see how he feels. maybe hes confused and likes both of you, if thats the case, you need to start hanging out before the other girls moves in|`|czAbrzcUaa	Better to ask than to never know.<br>  <br>  And by the way, capital letters are for three things: <br>  1. The start of sentences<br>  2. Names<br>  3. Place names
2hhGgKBZaa	Aww I'm sorry this has happened to you, I know these kinds of breakups are confusing. <br>  <br>  It's good that he's being honest and not stringing you along. He's trying to tell you he wants to be single, he wants to play the field. And even though he loves you and you had a nice relationship, he's itching for some single life.<br>  <br>  It's a bit of a rude shock for you of course, but it's good that he's coming clean to you about how he's feeling. I would let him go, he has told you what he wants, and trying to make him stay will only cause more trouble and grief. <br>  <br>  Let him go and find someone who wants to be in a relationship with you! Good luck :)|`|NGE7nIhqaa	He probably loves you, but he's not IN love with you. He wants to explore, so let him go. It's a sad deal, but what will be, will be. If you chase him, you might chase him completely away.|`|uDEaQ4uXaa	He's just being honest.  That's fair enough.  He wants to live life, not be shackled and tied down.|`|UjajMHH4aa	this basically happened to me last night, my boyfriend said he still loves me but he can't be with me right now. Make sure if you still love him, keep in contact with him as much as you can, become his best friend. Be really fun and out going around him and he will remember what he was missing! <br>  Men are very selfish sometimes and because he is young he thinks that it is okay to sleep around and "sow their wild oats" and you will be waiting when he gets back. If you still want him, make him realise exactly how fun you can be and that he still really wants you.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's not rude.  You asked a question and he was honest.  Don't ask questions you don't want answers for.  He wants to date other people and have a life without you.  Time to move on.
R1gqthbmaa	I don't think that the only problem here is how you are gonna see him again. Since you can't even see your friends, it's not very easy to see him. But you can still e-mail him. They didn't forbid that too, did they? But getting their trust back it's the most difficult thing. You have to change a lot, or at least show you've changed. Start studying a lot, don't spend hours alone in your room, just go and talk with them for stupid, unimportant things, just to show them you trust them for everything. Then show your best behaviour and I think that's all you can do. I don't guarantee they're gonna believe you straightaway, but eventually you'll get their trust back. Then, if he really cares for you and he can really wait, you'll be together again, much more careful, and you'll see if this can go on....
F7PVIfeJaa	So, I'm probably not supposed to tell you this, but I'm 21 and used to be in your position several times when I was in high school. I used to date the "bad boys" and my parents forbid me from seeing them quite often, but I did it anyways. I had a part time job at bk (you only have to be 14 to work there) and I would give them a different schedule than I actually worked so that I could spend time after work or before work with my bf at his house. Also I had a best friend that would always let me spend the night with her, but go out with my bf and cover for me before I came back to spend the night. I did not loose my virginity until I was 18 and that was a very big choice for me. I also did not do any of the "bad" things that my bf's did, and they did not bring it around me or even ask me if I wanted to try it because I made my beliefs known and I was very strong minded about it. My parents now know all of these things and I am happily married to a guy that my parents think is not good enough for me, but like I said, I am strong willed and believe that just because someone is bad, or not ideal (even in a parents eyes) that it does not mean that you should not hang out with them, date them, or even marry them. Everyone can change their stars-Everyone|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	Looks like you be alone with him for a while.  Give your parents time to cool off or at least talk to them about the guy.|`|37M3dkkRaa	you could ask your parents if he could come over to have dinner with you, that way they'd have a chance to meet him and see what they think about him. but if they say they don't like him or want you to be around him then you just have to accept that because parents only try to do what's best for their kids, trust me. i used to think my parents just wanted to ruin my day all the time, but it turns out they only try to protect you from things they don't think are good for you, and most the time they are right.
uGLYok2caa	Mmmm, lemme start off by telling you that my heart fell to the floor because im pretty much going through the same thing right now. However, what i have going on is still in the stage of him telling me he misses me and wants to see me and how we MIGHT get back together, the twist to MY story however, is that i suspect i am currently pregnant. of all people, i know how hard it is to ever TRY to get over someone who you thought was the one... But, think about it from HIS point of view, if he ever really did care about you, he wouldnt use that lame excuse of "we rushed into things too fast". If you believe someone is that one, then they should feel the same way, but apparently he did if he let go someone like you. Now, you seem like a very intelligent woman, and it sounds like you have a lot to offer. If he does not see this and is not willing to stick by your side, then don't waste your time even thinking about him anymore. Its not worth it. If someone does not see you for all the wonderful person you are, then that person is not worth the time of day. Simply, stop wasting time stressing about the past. Whats done is done, and it is what it is. Move on, and dont look back. :o)|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	I wonder if he was married and his wife got wind that you were in his life. Sometimes that'll scare a man off big time because he's been caught out. So, if that was the scenario it is 'safer' to drop you than risk divorce and lose of home and family.
EJWphb88aa	yes it does if u with the wrong person...|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	dunno i just dont hardly remember the good feelings about being in love.  only the sad crap.  gotta love and be loved for it to not stink!|`|plVoWHSoaa	i hate love it never works the way you want it to even though that's not the point =P <br>  Your meant to go out with the person you love but your to shy to ask and then they go and say no anyway -.-|`|htpxHZTPaa	Right now. yes, yes it does.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|T20lVPDkaa	It comes around. But its great when you find someone that you care about so much and are open with. It only stinks....sometimes.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Yea it wreaks. It's good sometimes but depends on your situation.|`|qwvijKexaa	yea sometimes, it can make you do crazy things|`|ukVNUgPFaa	it does until you meet that person who has the febreeze for your perspective on love. that right person will come into your life and make everything you do seem so important and good. youll feel beautiful and amazing no matter what you really look like and youll feel so comfortable you wont even know that youve fallen in love until you have to be without that one person and then the horrible smell of crappy fake love comes back, that is until your wonderful air freshener comes back and chases that horrid smelly love away.|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	no, i don't believe that love stinks. it's the most powerful emotion that's possible for a human to feel. it's different, exciting and makes you feel like you're on top of the world. special. even if you're in a bit of bad situation with love, i still don't think it sucks. it's just the crazy way it makes you feel.<br>  <br>  :)|`|71EwzPSlaa	usually when you break up this is the thought that goes thru ur head lol....i think it depends on where you are in your life...cuz you could be with someone and love would be the best thing and when they leave you its the worst..|`|FQxUpc9baa	yes <br>  u have to work to get the relationship work even harded to stay in it. then cry like hell when it's over <br>  so what's the point??|`|KK718Xxaaa	sometimes <br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|cvVMJQRZaa	Only when she doesn't love you back. Or says she does and plays whit your head.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	loves great, it makes you feel amazing :D|`|SMLVM9Ysaa	First of all why do you think that love stinks? think about it than think once again why you believe this. and as my answer sometimes i do think that it stinks and sometimes i dont. i guess it has its ups and downs like almost everything.|`|wpiWiWFiaa	Love has it's ups and it's downs.  Right now I am in the stage of thinking it stinks so yes.  Sooner or later though you will find that one person who will make you think it is the greatest thing in the world.|`|P10yQmydaa	I really don't believe in love. It seems like something that was made up to give people false hope. But yes, what people call "Love" is terrible, because you will always love someone who doesn't love you back.<br>  <br>  See ya, <br>  <br>  Death|`|TyJuZnZhaa	If you are going to think that, find reasons besides the fact a relationship you have isn't going so well.<br>  <br>  I really say it's neither good or bad.

HL8PEDFLaa	You need to get out, being stuck inside all day is not healthy|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	tell your teachers, talk to your dad.|`|2Z7eXVeWaa	No it's not good...kids need to get OUT. I'm not sayin late night parties or anything but at least out, and outside.|`|b621faedf42d72a5c7ed54b94d7879e0aa	Does your dad know that you get some of your vitamins from the sun?  I think it is vitamin D. It is not good to hide away from society. Sometimes it is nice to get away but not every day. He probably worries like all parents do. About what you guys will get into, and that's his way of keeping you two safe from the world. As a parent though I know that sometimes you just have to let your child go sometimes or he will never learn to make it in this cruel world. You can't protect your children when they grow up like you could when they were small. It's hard but very scarry for parents to see their children learn the hard way sometimes. When you do get to go out don't go wild, show him that you can be trusted and don't let him down. Good Luck with everything you are almost an adult now, don't rush it. You will have to do enough on your own soon enough.|`|AA10197673	um accually, thats called abuse. you need to go outside to get vitamin D from the sun, so if your inside all day, you could develop skin cancer, you dad may say this isnt true, but my dad is a college teacher and my mom works at genentech, your dad has issues. or if he still says no, then after school just hang out in town with friends or do an after school activity so your dad hs no choice. or just live with your mom, just call child abuse. if he is rly serious|`|4y4BXElwaa	it doesn't make him a bad parent. It looks like he has a fear of something happening to you and your sister. He may stop being so protective if you and your sister sit down and tell him that you guys are growing up and you need to get out and have a life. <br>  Maybe he just doesn't want to lose you.|`|jfiF9XIUaa	haha my daddy ws kind of like that too! but I was only allowed to go exactly in front of the house on the sidewalk lol he was just over protective. my mom was the one that didnt care. I couldnt even walk to the store by myself until I turned 15! and its only 5 min away lol! i am sorry you have been dealing with this but just keep bugging him shoot you are going to be 18 soon and I know you want to party and run around in the streets yelling with your friends lol well atleast thats what i did except for the partying|`|PMRY3osxaa	No it is not good, something is wrong with your dad.<br>  <br>  Talk to a counselor at school and tell them about that, maybe they can do something about it.|`|qRwykCMoaa	no it's not good at all especially as a teen if i wasn't let out of my house i would go crazy(no im not the crazy partying type)|`|xQFtk1FXaa	that sucks. Is it possible to move back in with your mom?? or maybe you could talk to your dad about it. compromise or something|`|mhvoPAOCaa	he may just be protective.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	He could be afraid for your safety because so much is happening to children these days but you and your sister are a little older so im not sure exactly what your father is thinking but explain to him that you feel caged in and that you need some air and that you need to have a social life and that this is apart of a healthy childhood. You have to talk to him and plan what you will say to him, maybe even write it out so that you dont forget anything. Ask him what his reason for this is. If you dont get any where with him talk to your mom and see if she has better luck and if not talk to a relative or a teacher but be careful what you say to your teacher because they could see it as child abuse and report their suspicion, but really you and your sister need the freedom to just be teenagers so good luck :-)|`|AldxfoeQaa	WoW!! <br>  I personaly don't think that's right.<br>  You&Your sister should be able to go outside&hang out with your friends.<br>  Espically since you guys are 17&16!\<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I used to go outside&hang with my friends all the time <br>  &at the age of 12!|`|xh1JnSfmaa	"Its easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission"<br>  you should just go out every now and then|`|8q82dLS8aa	wow....that's gonna mess you up<br>  <br>  sounds like your dad may be agoraphobic|`|mDJInjEaaa	umm he really cant do taht
gbOGWFkbaa	hey this one is easy approach her softly and tell her that u don't her boosting around like this and she has nothing more that this against you and as a good frind tell her that you are trying to guide her to the right path where talking too much aout yourself is personal loss...try this hope it works...if not then politely stop her whenever she starts off again & say you realy have some important work to do rather that listening to her...all the best ...hope this workkk|`|7ZGC5NZVaa	Um do the same, talk about yourself, tell her how your day was when she didnt even ask, show her how annoying it is. <br>  <br>  If you want the thing resolved then its not going to be done without some sort of bitter result.|`|UIOCG9jHaa	tell her to shut up talking about herself for once :)]more do it better than that obvi..|`|AhEZdxXtaa	You should try talking to her and explaining how you feel. If that doesn't work try switching the situation on to her so she knows how you feel.<br>  If all else fails just move out! She is some1 you have to deal with and see everyday. You don't want to lose your sanity, and if she's such a bad roommate she's not worth it!!|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Get a new roommate that one sounds self centered and annoying.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi Krissy,<br>  <br>  Wow, I am so sorry that you're miserable.  Your feelings are quite normal for being stuck in a bad situation like that.  Maybe you should go live with your Mom again.<br>  <br>  Being a teen is hard enough... even without busted families and all that garbage getting tossed into the mix.  <br>  <br>  Just try to be pleasant and do whatever your parents tell you.  Help around the house as needed.  Offer to do your own laundry.  Ask if there's anything you can do to keep things quiet and smooth.<br>  <br>  You sound like a nice young lady.  Can you try and talk to your parents?  Can you tell them your concerns?  If not, maybe a counselor at school or someone at your church can help... if you go to church.  Maybe you could pray to God for help.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens, don't become rebellious and decide you are going to start having sex to punish your parents... that'll just make your life ten-times worse.  And don't run away, either.<br>  <br>  You're a bit vulnerable right now.  Things will get better in the future for you, Krissy.  <br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>   - Charlie

Puppy love is often and usually when you're still in school. Once you've matured more and have been through a lot more relationships or experiences with the opposite sex, its gets easier and easier to know when you love someone. Its a lot easier to say what love isn't than what it is. Usually you just know but you might notice that you're doing things that you wouldn't normally do for anyone else without giving it a second thought, you can feel what that person is feeling and you'll go out of the way to make that person happy. Really, when you put that person ahead of you and start thinking of the two of you as one, like... how would i feel if he did this? or is this gonna help us? or how we can work on this to get better? I'd say you're feeling a mature love--- or atleast is a mature relationship--- Some say love is friendship set on fire...

She probably was a bit jealous but it shows what type of person she is and that she really isn't a good friend of support.<br>  <br>  good luck and congrads on your engagement|`|cW7xfPqUaa	that was very uncool for her to do that, you have a right to be mad. you could find a better friend|`|O22JiTsEaa	well your FRIEND is being a ***** if she truly a friend she would under stand|`|nspaGCh9aa	This is really long but from what I read so far in the first 4 paragraphs, you should be pissed at her.  Let her boyfriend go to the army for seven mos and she'd be down in an instant.  I really wouldn't want to talk to her anymore.  But when people start acting like that you just need to know that god only puts the people in your life that he wants to be.  If she continues acting like this, then you know that she's not a true friend.  You have an extremely reasonable excuse to post-pone your plans.  She is being very selfish toward you, and you should sit her down and let her know how she is acting and that you had a great excuse to have some time to your self.  She is the wrong one.  Good luck.|`|jUVqXdCoaa	Well you were upset and your boyfriend was leaving and that hurts and she wasn't there to understadn when she should have. it's okay to be upset but you should comfront her that ir dosen't make her a true friend for being that way!

Show care and concern for him so he will open to you otherwise he might just get mad.|`|BH4Chqq5aa	Honestly my best advice is this.....<br>  <br>  I just went through the same thing. Unfortunately SOME men will deny until they die. <br>  <br>  The question is can you deal with it? Are you able to go on in the relationship being normal and just pass it off or will it haunt you? <br>  <br>  Trust is earned not given away. If he has not earned your trust do not go back out with him. Or you can start slowly because of the fact that you are not "feeling" him 100%. <br>  <br>  This type of behavior needs to be dealt with and he also needs to understand that you as a woman will NOT put up with it. Do not go back on your words. You have to be strong. Because the minute you let someone walk all over you it will happen again. <br>  <br>  Ultimately you dont know if its truely over, because he hasnt even given you a reason why he broke up with you. Dont you deserve to know?
QcDN1Bizaa	TELL HER. girls love honesty. just tell her BUT just say 'well there we go i just wanted to let you know, do what you like with it' kind of thing and if she tells you she likes you too then go for it! if shes just like thanks or doesnt say anything dont constantly shower her with compliments or nag her about going out cos it will completely put her off. keep being yourself and she may fall for you :)<br>  <br>  but seriosuly, i am a girl lol and she would love it if you just told her. she might even feel the same?! even if she doesnt she'd rather know. :)|`|QIqPwcH6aa	Girls are actually pretty smart. Most will pick up what you are trying to say before you actually manage to say it. <br>  <br>  So don't fuss too much over exactly how you want to phrase it... saying something as simple as "I really like you" or "would you like to go out sometime" will probably be enough.|`|gKhR0sgLaa	You could try asking her to hang out.<br>  <br>  Don't directly tell her that you like her though, that could scare her away, and you don't want that.|`|RwEpGG4caa	....don't think too much...just tell her how you feel about her, say it from ur heart...she will know it...<br>  good luck!!!
UAkXfIGWaa	Well, the spark is probably gone because she's been under a lot of stress lately. That happens to a lot of couples. One thing you can do is be really supportive of her- don't push her sexually. Try to seduce her or entice her if you want. Do something really romantic and sweet, show her that you still really care about her. I know that when the spark is gone, things will seem like they are going down hill, but with a little effort and creative thinking, you can bring things back around. Don't give up! Be supportive and when the timing is right be romantic, a back massage or bubble bath etc.. Good Luck :)|`|jr2dpYKIaa	i have been dating my boyfriend for almost as long as you its been almost 15 months now and we barely started having sex 3 months ago but even then we still have our spark and have had it from day one, we both get busy and cant always have sex, but that shouldnt make you lose your spark unless you never really had it. talk to her and tell her how you feel, maybe if you tell her everything will be better, i mean what could it hurt your already talking about losing her, so either way it could be lose lose, but at least with talking her you could possible fix things.|`|1d97f437b76a0030652830c7d3da17f3aa	Funny how you say "...she is going to lose me...."<br>  <br>  Maybe she doesn't want you. Maybe she wants YOU to do SOMETHING. Maybe you NEED to do something so YOU won't lose HER.<br>  <br>  If you really want to be with her then try something as simple as talking. Ask her what the problem is. If she says she's just too tired, first of all, maybe she really is. Have you been paying attention? Is she busy? Kids, work, school... etc...???? Maybe you can help in that way and take some of the burden off of her shoulders so she has time and energy to be with you.<br>  <br>  Secondly, maybe she's just not interested in you anymore. Maybe you need to make more of an effort instead of complaining about her.<br>  <br>  Lastly....<br>  Maybe she's thinking the same thing about you.<br>  <br>  Instead of asking us..... ask her.|`|TqBXKOeeaa	if you love her dont leave her im just saying people go through there times when you want to be alone and a relationship isnt all about sex maybe she is trying to show you that you dont just have to have sex to love someone she wants you to prove to her u onlt want her just stay steady but dont be cliggy just be normal talk to her about it girls love that when a guy tells them their feelings and how they feel TALKING is the biggest key in a relationship so just understand each other|`|bhtL4xUXaa	Just tell her how you feel...*honestly*.

Has she been busy in ways she cant aviod (like work or important family committments) or is she just seeing her friends alot etc. If there are things she can adjust in her life to help you get the spark back in your relationship she needs to hear from you that you need a bit more of her time/committment. <br>  <br>  The "new feeling" wont last forever, but a good relationship with good communication can.|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Your lucky it lasted that long,she just takes you for granted now.Dump her and move on|`|8cohvjj9aa	i cant believe dat shes goin to lose u, jus coz shes too busy and cant have sex... if u rly luv her, u shouldnt be sayin such a terrible thing...<br>  if u wanna have ur sex back, jus talk to her and tell her ur a man and need that...im sure she will do da best to make things better ...|`|Z4B93N31aa	shes been busy i feel like that too sometimes when we are both busy with School, and him with hes skating but then it goes away when we talk again and we are free from everything <br>  i talk to him about it you should too!|`|usj1lyfFaa	So how long did you expect that spark to last?

I hope this helps b/c I know how to play their little game, and trust me the game is always being played!!|`|4L6FFR3zaa	from the info u gave me im thinking that there is a slight possibility that he does, but i wouldn't get ur hopes up just yet. it might b that ur mind is messing with u because u WANT him to like u.but as i said b4 there is a possibility. ur welcome.|`|OltbAYQNaa	Get to know him morre by hanging out together.If he keeps wanting to talk/joke and laugh with you its possible.........But..............Boys minds are confundling............|`|l4Bwdwvmaa	He's deff interested. if he's new it probably wont be long before some other girl snags him so get on that!|`|yIMUfAj4aa	maybe you should ask him if he has feeling for you, and ask him out
8PkEkTcZaa	NO! its never good to get revenge just leave it as it is no matter what and how bad the story is and i am sure you have heard of what goes around comes around or the word KARMA!!!!! so don't cause you should know two wrongs don't make a right!!|`|uQosyhrSaa	DonT woRRY, im also in the same shoes as you....<br>  except, i think mine is worst because all of my BEST FRIENDS<br>   turn there backs on me!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  and not only that, it started out as we were playing around hitting each other and it ended up us fighting !!!!!!!<br>  <br>  just ignore them, tell talk to you as soon as they want to tell you a secret=D
fI9vYOQPaa	ask him out or , get someone to see if he likes u then tell u|`|u5y8kE81aa	bubbles inside? im no doctor, but i don't think that is good.|`|X6C6kZKKaa	he's looking for free sex. dump the dude.|`|54GbKfgRaa	Try to be your self ,but also don't show him that you have a crush on him! cos that will make him careless about you .<br>  And if u really like him DON'T TRY TO FORGET HIM cos u will not succeed in that.<br>  And remember there is no such thing called love 4 ever so try to ease ur crush cos it may not last too long!<br>  Hope I helped !|`|GlEwAhj0aa	just ask him out on a date!!!!
JEOBrEbFaa	He might be terrified because of past experiences. It took my boyfriend a long time to really dare to feel close to me, because his previous girlfriend broke up with him after six years, and he had the worst time of his life. He was really depressed for a year. So when he met me, he was sure that one day I would leave him to. I could see that after a period of having a lovely time together, he would withdraw and not want to meet me, or start a fight about something stupid.<br>  Anyway, slowly he lost his fears.|`|UhWQuxLVaa	its hard 2 explain|`|sHKeLaFsaa	Wow that is a loaded question. I think that is why therapists get paid so much. It takes alot of talking to get to the root of things to really know something like that. You have to really know the person, their personality, habits, history and so on.|`|s5Dy3RQyaa	He really should not be terrified that he is in love with you!  Unless he still wants to look around and have different relationships, which would tell me he isn't ready to marry or not in love with you yet.
gRXy66dOaa	ask her to the movies|`|wKWhUwEmaa	Ask her if the 2 of you can go get a coffee or something one day after school or work. Play 20 Q's to get to know her a little better. Be sure to give her tons of compliments girls like guys who make them feel special.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|0EOSODAZaa	MAKE A MOVE SON
4pHTkTUaaa	I think you should stear clear.  I have dated the type before and it will end in heartache.  Take it as a good thing that he has been leaving you alone because guys like that are more trouble than they are worth and you will probably end up being the one hurt.  Not to mention you may upset your friend.  I know that may not be what you want to hear but that is what I think.  I am 30, if that helps--I have seen this before.
7ciw1aCXaa	How old are you? Your English is not good, and I had to reread it several times to try and understand what you are asking.<br>  <br>  Eventually he'll slow down. Look up things for premature ejaculation like the squeeze technique.|`|1glKIE5Baa	thats savage lol|`|441GSyaMaa	It's that or just generally a premature ejaculator... just take it slower, try let him take control and when he feels like reaching the top of his hill... make him pull out and just kiss him for a while or something...|`|v1uNUcwCaa	he is ejaculating prematurely<br>  maybe get a cock ring coz they can help him last longer but not a vibrating one.<br>  he has to practice holding it in. when he feels like cuming he should get out and hold it. when the feeling goes he should enter you again. it will be hard for him to do so you need to be supportive.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Oh dear........................|`|BEqAhXBlaa	wait a few years till your not jailbait and get with a man not a boy|`|oKE6mramaa	Well I can just suggest taking it slow, and giving it time as a month means you've not been having sex together for too long :) he could relax once the nerves calm. Perhaps switching positions during sex will help as it tends to make guys last longer from my experience, don't use positons where you're on top till you're ok with him coming because when they can't control the pace they can't hold back so easily.|`|1e66262e2ef399091d3ff08f8c8d60c0aa	my suggestion is more foreplay and less gettin down and dirty so quickly how about trying some fun things first, if he is quick on the trigger then maybe you should first give him oral or a hand job so he can unload and then work him back up so you can have some down and dirty sex , its really not that uncommon for a guy to unload fast,it happens way more than you would ever hear about, but now is the time to have him learn and who better than you to teach him ,its a learned thing so be patient and don't get discouraged , the magic number could be 69 ?|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	i have the same problem.i always want make her *** first ,it never happened it was disappointing and frustrating,relationship may break,<br>  <br>  i found  a technique<br>  <br>  after foreplay i did oral sex for her,eventhough i hate to lick pussy,then she begs me to put it in ,no i won't do that,keep giving oral,then i masturbate her,by the time definitelyy its *** for herat leastt 2 times,then only i insert mine,still it will ejaculate fast.<br>  <br>  then i bought hollow penis from sex toys shop and insert my penis in to it and bang her till she cries stop stop.u may have to use lubricant , when using rubber penis.<br>  <br>  i have tried all creams,lotions,but no use.its for moneymaking only.<br>  now am giving enough to partner through my fingers,tounge,and rubber penis.we will not use vibbrators.now i really enjoy licking,i can do it for hours.<br>  <br>  we r happy now and 2gether for 3 years.|`|HKoLBQBUaa	factors could be:<br>  <br>  smokes<br>  <br>  alcohol<br>  <br>  drugs<br>  <br>  diet<br>  <br>  exercise<br>  <br>  also his ages and experience.<br>  <br>  nevers can play a big part too.<br>  <br>  also it can become a habbit as he will worry about it everytime you have sex. this can become a nasty cycle.<br>  <br>  be supportive seek advice, and try reccommended exercises and more fore play.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|ZTXRF7fuaa	I don't know but I have the same problem, only it's been 2 years. Can't wait to see what advice people give.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	Ok first of all you both need to be really chilled out about it - like it don't matter! That in it's self may cure it! If not c**k rings can help slow it down but the thing I found most effective is to simply have more sex!<br>  <br>  I know it might sound really stupid but it works for my partner and I. If we haven't had sex in say a week it will be over in less than a minute. But if we have sex everyday it can be like 5-10 minutes. Also, another thing we do (if we haven't done it in over a week) is have it and let him do his stuff quickly - then just wait 2 hours and do it again - he can go for about an hour (if not more) this way - usually I'm the one that then gives in!<br>  <br>  Another tip maybe to get your fingers ready for when they are near to pop. press down firmly (but not too hard) between the balls and bum - but this only usually gives him seconds longer (and pretty pointless and sometimes painful!).<br>  <br>  If you're the opposite and want it to happen quicker - try one finger up his bum (he he he)! It works!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	Well it sounds like neither of you are that old...teenagers I'd say?  <br>  <br>  If that is true and he's not been with a lot of people or a lot of experience then this could have an effect on him.  Believe it or not over time men and women develope their sexual skill, yes, skill, from experience.  Im not saying by NO MEANS, go out and sleep around, lol...but He's got to learn what the feeling is like leading up to that moment so that he can control when he stops.  Once he learns what that moment is and to pull out BEFORE he reaches his max...then he will be able to stop and let the feeling go back down.  A lot of four play may work well to the both of your advantage...more so possibly for you.  If he can learn when to stop and slow it down then he could possibly play with you...orally, finger you, or etc...whatever you like....while he's giving himself time to calm down...and yet, you, are still getting pleasure out of it and possibly reaching your moment BEFORE he does!  <br>  <br>  Another thing would be if he is doing it really fast to slow it down a bit.  Even though it may not feel AS WELL for him, it could still possibly get you off!  Something else that could help him is....masterbation....either you doing it for him or him doing it.  I know I am speaking very openly but IF the two of you want a great sex life together then you've got to get used to your bodies and talk like this!  If you aren't used to that then that's probably a part of the source of the problem.  But, masturbating, you or him, would give him practice on knowing when to stop before he reaches his max.  <br>  <br>  He's probably very embarrassed by this himself, but a man can always change leaving a girl empty handed, rather he cums first or not.  If the two of you are teenagers, I  hope you are doing this responsibly...using condoms....or atleast him pulling out...so if he cums then he does have many fingers and a mouth if he comfortable with doing that!  Either way, he doesn't have to leave you empty handed everytime!   <br>  <br>  A few other things could be you playing with yourself while the two of you are having sex.  They also make what they call "extended pleasure" condoms.  They make condoms with vibraters on them.  I have never used these but a lot of people say they work.  They do make oils...one I personally recommend is the ky, his and hers....its truly fast for the both of you.  Just experiment with things...along with each other and see what works for you.  I think he's got to learn how to control himself, with practice...by masturbation (done by you and him) and sex with you!  And this will take time, so for now start with foreplay for you....and put alittle foreplay in the middle...and if he cums before you, do it at the end too.  If he usually cums after 5 minutes...stop after about 3 minutes and just play with each other or talk dirty to each other...then start again....<br>  <br>  Good luck
uQosyhrSaa	BALLOONS!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|czmiYdjkaa	You should get both.|`|4hGiHtNhaa	balloons. If she is your best friend, both or some other things like make up or jewlery or maybe a gift card to her fave store.
Uj5kuzoJaa	Go and tell him and quit being a chicken. The worst he can do is say he doesn't like her and then at least she can start moving on|`|2xhISlUEaa	well if he doesnt like her he doesnt like her.<br>  she cant force him to like her so tell her to move on|`|KwjVZOseaa	God i thought it was going to be something serious.<br>  Move the **** on, because she'll get with him and then realize she likes this other guy better.<br>  Women suck like that.|`|NZLh6epWaa	well first she might want to actually figure out if he likes her before she gets all crazy about him... but i would just try to not be so in LOVE as she is until she actually knows that she has a chance.. <br>  GOOD LUCK :)|`|2hcA3VP9aa	tell her to move on because she will just get hurt in the long run
VAI6MtPIaa	Are you sure he loves you? To me, it doesn't seem like it. You say that he's not a good boyfriend from what others tell you so maybe its better for you to move on and find someone who isn't a jerk about everything? With him having a constant need for controlling everything.. how can you ever be in control? Not every guy wants to be in control or wants their partner to be in control. <br>  <br>  I would respect my elder too unless they were WAY out of line. It's just respectful not to. <br>  <br>  He's hard on you because he is a jerk! Not because he loves you. If he loved you HE wouldn't act the way he does. He is trying to control YOU! "If you don't do thins I'm going to break up with you?" That's bs and you know it.|`|htWw0OlCaa	You need to find someone better that will treat you with respect. Leave is a**..... You can do so  much better.|`|htpxHZTPaa	He's not worth it. Leave him.<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09|`|4f706c14e35c0cbccf608f9498e77521aa	if he wants a girl to stand up for herself. why is he constantly putting you down and has to be in control of everything? yes you should stand for yourself always. you are the only one who is in control of your life besides GOD. if he isn't a good boyfriend to you anyway, why is you still with him? maybe you should leave him.|`|5b2Bhpvnaa	girlie...you're not a pushover in fact it seems you have a lot of respect....not to be rude but your man is *** and there's no excuse to "be hard" on someone especially if he loves you..."what is he training you for something?" and even if you did change into this hard-***, he wouldn't like it cuz he would an ***...and it wouldn't be you...my advice be yourself and if you're a softy be a damn good softy cuz it makes you, you which is beautiful :)|`|ukVNUgPFaa	tell him that if he wants a dominatrix, he can look in the classifieds but while he does that, youll be finding a new, hotter, nicer, better MAN to take care of you. you dont need that guy, hes just using you to make you feel like hes got some authority.|`|ghbaAWOCaa	he loves you..yet is prepared to break up with you if you dont listen to him?..funny guy. According to what youre saying, he seems to think a bit too much of himself...or simply thinks your nothing without him. Sounds ratehr like a threat to me.<br>  <br>  He should understand that case especially, that your not going to get rude with an elderly or in any case anyone older than you without very good reason. Either tell him to learn to talk sense..or walk away and watch yu walk in the oppisite direction.|`|9dvDlMdhaa	You should just Forget him. He's not good for you. If a real guy loved you he wouldn't have put you down. You are absolutely right about not yelling back at the elder. Just forget him and keep searching.|`|ODgT8zgvaa	Um hun if he isnt a good boyfriend (Which he doesnt sound like one) DUMP HIS ***. You deserve so much better. Every girl deserves a boy that will treat them right. Same with guys. You shouldnt have to disrespect a elder just to make him happy. He sounds like he isnt into a "real" relationship. No relationship should be about controlling the other person. Um if he really "loves" you..He wouldnt be treating you like this. I know what its like to controlled of and ya its not worth it..I hope you make the right decision. And I wish you the best of luck! :D
xZI6noJiaa	I don't think you're right. Yeah, I can say hey that chick is pretty, but I have no wish to kiss her. Just because I may think she's pretty doesn't mean I'm attracted to her. Any more than I wish to kiss a guy that I don't find attractive. Sounds like you're living in a bit of a fantasy land.<br>  Turn the tables. Why don't men just go on dates with other men? Hmm? Wouldn't you want to try kissing another guy you might think of as attractive? I have a feeling your answer would be no. Lol.|`|AA11107821	No chance. I wouldn't date a woman just because it's "in" if I'm not attracted to women. I would think other straight women would feel the same way. Otherwise, if you're attracted to women and want to kiss them, that would be called gay.|`|VVH1KWaaaa	I pray for it everyday|`|0CKwjdKSaa	It's already common dude. Are you in the 17th century?|`|SR1FN2nqaa	umm....NO.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	Don't be so suburban. These things happen all the time, everywhere in the world. If they're hanging out to get to know each absent the pretense of any kind of sexual relationship, that's called...being friends. Differentiating between male and female friends as, boy- and girlfriends, is a useless tool of categorization and is inherently anti-free society. If you create categories like this, you open the dialogue of discrimination among those categories. If the concept of race didn't exist, there would be no racism. See how that works? Get over it, let people do what they want to do, except if it actually damages someone else, and everyone will be a lot happier. <br>  <br>  Do you hang out with your friends who are guys? It's the same thing, you just don't call it a date because of the social convention regarding homosexuality and the persistent fear of homosexuals that pervades this country.|`|srNze5uIaa	I think we are really begining to think that all that matters in life is sex.<br>  <br>  I am just waiting for the day when pedophelia will become common too, when incest will be normal, and whatever goes.<br>  <br>  We will be so free by f**king everybody, everywhere, everytime. yeah! <br>  I can't help but feel tired with this side of life.
k4MoFEWeaa	I saw your post and instantly knew I had to answer your question because I know all too much about this.<br>  <br>  You've had sex with over 7 guys? If you're under the age of 20, you should be ashamed of yourself! If your boyfriend has any sense of self respect or decency, he would dump you and find someone that didn't whore themselves out to the world. It sounds like he has been brought up with morals. Hard to find men like that these days. Men like that would sacrifice anything for their family and live by a code of respect. I would know. I am one of these men.<br>  <br>  It's so stupid how both men and women think that it's okay to sleep around and they don't realize the mistake they've made until someone good comes along and doesn't want to accept their ugly past. A persons past determines their future, and any guy with a good head on his shoulders would know that. If a man doesn't want to accept a woman past, it's the woman's fault for having one in the first place! What happened to self respect and waiting for the one? Obviously you lack self discipline/self control. No man wants to marry a prostitute!<br>  <br>  You can be sure of one thing. If you're not something spectacular and the type of woman that makes him feel so good that he can't live without you, then he'll probably end up leaving you for the next girl that doesn't have as much baggage.<br>  <br>  It's like buying a car. Why would a man want a car that has been used up and thrown away, when he can get a brand new shiny one? Unless the used car is something really rare and has something that's just impossible to find in a new car, chances are, he's going to choose the new car over the used car. <br>  <br>  I almost got married to a woman like you, but broke things off because of her past sexual life. We got back together because she couldn't find anyone quite like me and I decided to swallow the anguish our relationship brought. She poured her heart and soul into me which is the only reason I stuck with her faithfully. It took me twenty years of marriage to forgive her. Her dedication and loyalty to me was one of the things that saved our relationship and saved our marriage. When I forgave her, I fell in love... All the years of hatred felt like time I wasted. We have three kids now, and we couldn't be happier. We have helped each other through hard times and enjoyed the good times together. I will never find another woman that could replace my wife, she is the most amazing woman alive. <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to think to yourself if you really want to spend the rest of your life slaving to make up for your past? It could be a lifelong process before he comes around... if he even does. For years I felt like I was cheated out of happiness, but my wife walked on hot coals and sacrificed all of her to prove herself. That is just impossible to ignore no matter how much you despise the person.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I feel for you and I know how painful it can be.|`|VjZxJwfYaa	Yes sweetie i no people who have slept with way more people than that and they have found good guys actually some are married. Don't feel like that because only a real guy can understand and respect that every person has a past before they came along and if they can't deal with that, they need to keep it moving. At least your honest about it and that's the #1 rule to any relationship HONESTY! All of us have done some things that we are not proud of but that's what makes you the person you are today from making mistakes and learning from them. You will find a guy that will accept you for who you are and not judge you by your past. LOL!|`|EYt8H5N2aa	I believe there are some guys out there who will accept you. Everyone makes mistakes. There are things in people's past we will never find out about because it is just that sacred to them. You have already accepted them because you do not know about it. There will be someone who will love you for you because they know that you are special. If this world was based on perfection, no one would be alive. Know what you are worth and that if someone cannot accept you, they do not deserve you. Try to work it out but if not, there is someone out there better that is made especially for you!|`|XSEWADI0aa	There is a lot of us that have done many bad things such as you, but now its time to start fixing "your name"<br>  <br>  When people say your name, what do they think of? someone who is lazy, thankful, ungrateful, shy, pretty, thoughtful, sweet..etc?<br>  <br>  A good name is developed by many small acts over a period of time. All that is needed to spoil it, though, is one foolish act. A single incident of sexual misconduct, for example, can sully a fine reputation.<br>  <br>  You can fix a scared reputation by doing many small acts, and as time passes, the good will over ride the bad..get to work gurlie :)|`|GQRs83Haaa	Yes, If they really loved you, then they would except your past. I've been with two guys. The first guy I just hooked up with... we were friends. A couple weeks later I got together with my current boyfriend and we've been together for a year. We are getting married too. He was a virgin until me and wishes I was too. He thinks its stupid that I would just hook up with a friend my first time. But he understands that the past is the past, we don't talk about it anymore and all is fine!|`|sHKeLaFsaa	I wouldn't say it's something I'd bring up on the first few dates... I would actually wait till you can prove honestly to YOURSELF, that this is the one. That he is the one you will stay with, no one else will ever measure up, no one will even tempt you. When you can get to that point, then it's time to bring him in and sit down and talk.<br>  By that time, he will know you, that you can be trusted, that you ARE devoted to ONLY him, that you can't be swayed by a cutie walking by.<br>  Then yes, it's something you will have to work through. But if there is love there, you will get through! Have faith. There are REAL gentlemen out there yet. Honest, gentle, loving men. We just have to find them. I am still looking for mine too. If you want, you can email me...crystl_54495@yahoo.com|`|s5Dy3RQyaa	You need to have another history.  A history that you haven't slept with anyone else!  Time heals all wounds.  If it has been a while, or long time ago and you do not do it anymore its ok.  If it is recent, maybe not because you would have to prove to me you are no longer sleeping with guys.  They should forgive you if they know you stopped!|`|s7seaaPkaa	i dont agree with these girls at all.<br>  i think you should always tell your BF <br>  your past.but my opinion i think that you should wait till you think your more serious with him then let him know cuz you might scare him off.<br>  you gotta have class and self respect if you want someone to look at you as a woman and not a piece of a**.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Don't worry I know there are bunch of guys out there that will love you for who you are and will expect you for your past . If the person you are with right now doesn't expect you for what happen then he's not the one.|`|RzZBU8elaa	TRUST ME AND TAKE MY ADVICE ALRIGHT?<br>  NEVER EVER TELL A MAN ABOUT YOUR PAST<br>  NOT THE PARTNERS YOUVE HAD OR THE RELATIONSHIP EXPERIENCES YOUVE HAD<br>  NEXT A REAL MAN WILL REALIZE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR PAST IS THE PAST AND IF YOU LOVE HIM AND HE LOVES YOU THEN IT REALLY SHOULDNT MATTER|`|KSQ8y2Itaa	7 guys??? Why can't i find a girl like that. Depends on what they did to sleep with ya. I need more details. Did they do it on the first date, 6th date, did they buy you things. It just really really depends on alot.|`|RbGycz46aa	To start a relationship with ANOTHER guy, i'd be honest and true to him and this time, i'd truly be faithful. But i am sure a guy would accept you. I do believe it but try to be faithful.|`|XZ8lPLezaa	i see it this way.. if he doesn't know about the past it wont hurt him.. a more experienced girl is always good for a guy anyways|`|AA10495187	Yeah I would as long as you used condoms and did some tests.|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	ya|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	EVERYONE HAS A PAST.<br>  <br>  The past that we have lived and the lessons we have learned from our experiences is what makes us the people we are today.  Every step we take in our daily lives forms the people we will be tomorrow.  <br>  <br>  I know that sounds goofy, but it is true.  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of things in my past that I would like to forget and certainly don't want to admit.  But I have learned something from each of them.  They made me who I am, every single ugly thing from my past has a positive impact on the good person I am today.  <br>  <br>  Now, as for you.  You are who you are and you want someone to love you for that.  <br>  7 is not a big number, girl, don't freak out.  Some things are yours to keep to yourself.  My bf and I are very open about our pasts, we both know that there have been MANY before each other but we NEVER discuss numbers.  Oh my stars, that would suck......... If a guy asks, he's asking for trouble and he knows it.  I always stick with the number "Not very many" and it seems to do me quite well.  <br>  <br>  So all that being said, the number of people you have slept with does not make you who you are.  Any guy who thinks otherwise doesn't deserve you and doesn't live in the real world.  You will be fine.|`|FKs8tGZLaa	yes some1 willl except u.. just b patient and wait for mr.right to come along|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Of course people will accept you. It's unfortunate that you're in love with someone who can't accept your past, for the simple reason that everyone's past makes people what they are today. <br>  <br>  You know what? That person you're with now, you don't need them. They can't accept you as you are now, they're not worth your time.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	of course.  instead of being with someone who punishes you in the present for your past...geesus....how can you move forward?  your bf is a jerk actually and next time you get with a guy, you can say youve been with 8 guys!   and if he doesnt like it, turn the tables...say that they were horrible lovers!!  haha!!|`|xZ6UY0araa	Ill tell you this girl don't tell him.  Your past is your past. My boyfriend we had been friends before so he kinda knew all my stuff. but he loves me. For me now, and what happen is the past. We started our life together. So yes there are good men out there. And if you feel bad that shows right there you regret it an that you want to move on from it.|`|mBXu5G5saa	well you just have to find yourself.. see because the guy that won't accept you because you slept around, i think he just has standards and he goes by them but, just get your life together, stop having sex with these guys that you don't like and you never know maybe you might find your guy, the one you really want!|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	s3x3b3r3 has it exact!<br>  You never want to know for sure.|`|sa5bBAdsaa	hoe|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I'm sure there are a few out there. You have to look at it if you were in<br>  his shoes. He could be afraid of venereal disease. He will also think if he falls for you that you are to easy to bed.

There's really no secret about how to lose weight.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	exercise, it helps a lot.|`|L44LBa2Xaa	I'm also trying to lose weight.<br>  Try running/walking daily for 30 minutes. <br>  Do some sit ups/push ups <br>  And eating healthy - no sugar / junk food.|`|VBdXray0aa	Hi Panama,   all you have to do is not eat or drink anything that has flour or sugar.  This is not as easy as it sounds.   We all like our junk food and goodies.  Also check labels and try not to consume more that 50 or 60 carbs a day.    The weight will fall off of you.<br>  <br>  Lay off the sodas and drink bottled water.  If the water is flavored or enhanced, check the label for sugar and carbs.   You can do it.    Excercise will come naturally.<br>  Good luck    Daisy|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Cut the sugar cut the drinking and smoking and drink loads of water and do intensive exercises. You can do it for free by going on different websites and explains how to do what. you can go to gyms to motivate you more but likely to be expensive so it's your choice.<br>  <br>  How about you stick a nasty pictures on the walls, fridges or cupboards of foods and se if that will help you..|`|sCr2iTczaa	Why don't you exercise, and eat healthy.

You're accountable to someone and feel guilty if you don't get your workouts in.  <br>  <br>  Honestly though, if you've had that much bad luck, maybe you need to look in different places for a mate.  It's not like you're THAT overweight.|`|eK6IKkMkaa	just exercise dude, there's no tricks to get slimmer quick, and don't try any of them stupid atkins diet because as soon as you lose the weight you just put back on the weight unless you change you diet all together, just take small steps.

It is the most heartbreaking, most depressing feeling you could experience.  It makes you feel worthless, that you're just not good enough for anyone, that nobody wants you.  Every rejection letter is another blow, and you stop having faith in yourself.<br>  <br>  I know; I am there right now.  I am college educated and was laid off because my boss's business was failing and he couldn't pay me anymore.  I have had one interview in three months, despite checking the newspaper everyday, networking with friends and family, and mailing resumes out to companies in the hopes that they are hiring.  One interview.  Countless rejection letters and calls.  Lots of people just ignoring me like I don't exist.<br>  <br>  So pretend I'm your boyfriend.  Tell me, what more should I be doing?  I don't have the money to start a business like you, and I don't have the money to go back to college like you.  And because all my friends have jobs, I have no one to talk to.  People have forgotten about me.  The only social life I have, the only place where people accept me and want to have anything to do with me, is playing a game online.  They are the *only* adventures he has right now because he can't tell you about his day.  That IS his day.  After scouring the newspaper for jobs, there is nothing else to do.  I know this.<br>  <br>  Before you dump your boyfriend for being "unmotivated" and "helpless", I think you need to look at this from his perspective.  You have also abandoned him because you don't have time for him with your busy schedule.  You are now the man in the relationship, like you said -- and that is a huge, huge blow to his ego.  His friends are working and probably don't call him as much.  They don't come around.  I can't even stress how hard it is to come out of this, especially since we are in a recession.  Back when I willingly sought out other jobs, I had a ton of interviews and lots of possibilities.  And now?  Sometimes I wonder if the mail ever gets delivered because everyone ignores me.<br>  <br>  The best way for you to understand this would be to get fired yourself, but I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.  Just know that it is hard, that your boyfriend probably is suffering from depression, and that he feels like nobody gives a damn about him.  That's how I feel sometimes.  But I know that I have done everything I can to improve my situation, and now it's just a waiting game.  There is nothing more that I can do, except try to stay happy and sane.  It is hard, and I don't think you understand that there are circumstances beyond your boyfriend's control right now.  The job market is dry.<br>  <br>  Relationships are all about conquering these difficult issues together.  If you can't hack it (or choose not to because you don't understand, you are afraid, whatever the reason), move on.|`|ee5MawLdaa	Sounds to me like this 28 year old is immature for his age if he just takes the easy way out of a situation. He cant be a man and do something for himself, be someone, do something. On the other hand maybe he tried and then gave up after a while ???|`|MB0ARQiJaa	Try to have a talk with him, if that doesn't work you need to move on. He just doesn't have his act together.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	Run! Run far away!|`|54VqkaRaaa	Hi Lily.  I can definitely understand why you might be losing attraction to your boyfriend here.  It's natural for the women to wanna be with a guy who shows dominant traits such as leadership, confidence, and self assurance.  It's also normal to want your man to have a steady job and provide or at least have the potential to provide for a family.  That being said, right now we're living in a crazy world.  Your boyfriend is one of many who are feeling the strain of a mighty strong recession.  So in some respects, you might need to cut him some slack.  It definitely seems to me that he's not trying very hard here and he may need a little push to get him motivated again so he can eventually find a job.  I would talk with him.  Be nice about it...if you really care for him you should want him to get a job not just for you, but for him.  Know that he's going through a tough time.  The video games might be his way of pretending things aren't so bad.  In the end, you have to do what you feel is right in terms of whether or not you wanna continue being in a relationship with this guy.  But be fair about it, and give him a chance by talking with him and motivating him to go out and look for a job.  Say things like, "I know you're capable of getting back out there and finding a great job because you're great at what you do and people like you".  Don't say, "Why are you being so lazy, it's totally a turnoff and I've lost all respect for you".  Even if that's what you're feeling, it's not going to solve anything.  Approach it with a good heart, and perhaps you'll find that he'll start gaining motivation to get a new job.  Encourage him with positive reinforcement.  And remember, even with hard work, finding a job right now is hard for anyone.  Hope this helps!|`|QtTvjLS4aa	Don't listen to any of these people, what they are doing is putting a negative attitude in your mind and are trying to make you feel as though you are a terrible person. Yes getting laid off is hard on anyone, but it's not like a job will fall from out of the sky and your boyfriend will be employed again, that is what you have to let him realise. That's the mistake alot of people make, yes we all know how hard it can be for people who have lost their jobs, but feeling sorry for them and pretending like it's not a big deal and nothing is wrong is the worse approach to take in a situation like this. I think it's very nice of you thinking about your boyfriend like that, and it shows that you really care for him, it is also good that you are taking some concern in his life and this particular situation that he is in because it seems as no one is telling him this and also not even his sister who is allowing him to stay at her house which i feel is wrong. Nothing is wrong with her helping him, but she also should be encouraging him. If i were you i would tell him how you feel about what he is doing right now and that you feel he should be doing a bit more. What you have to remember is that this situation has nothing to do with him being poor or anything like that, it's his attitude to this situation, which in my case is very wrong and you yourself know this. Alot of people have been laid off like he has, but they are getting back on their horse and getting back out there looking for any and all jobs that they can get right now. Even trying to get a part-time job at a supermarket is a start, it's not his ideal job we all know that, but you know what? it will give him hope and it will motivate him. Your boyfriend will never get a job by lying around, he needs to start looking again, he has to remember that he is not the only one who has lost his job, there are thousands of people, so he has alot of competition and getting a job will not be any easier, it's just going to be much harder. He has to put in a bit more effort not every single time he has, but just a bit more and that is all you want and are asking of him. If your boyfriend loves you he will not consider what you tell him as cruel or insensitive, and depending on how he reacts to what you tell him will decide if you should stay with him or leave and it will also show what he thinks of you and what he feels about you. Him playing video games is just destroying him, yes he is enjoying himself as he plays them, but what happens after the games? the fact is he will still be unemployed and will be no where in life, he is just hiding his depression and pain behind the games. You just want to see him happy again and doing nothing is the worse thing to do, it solves nothing, so it's great that your there to help motivate him and carry him through this time. Hope i helped.|`|aeee4f0cd8f8b54cba0e6fac9a771ebdaa	Everyone goes throught rough times, Getting laid off is blow to your ego and he might be feeling down about it. Is he a good guy? Does he treat you right? then give him some time. If its been too long, tell him whats up, that you love him but if he doesnt at least try to get his life on track you will be moving on
PBdPD748aa	well there is no right or wrong way really...<br>  <br>  i did a round of phone calls the next morning after my fiance proposed... the worst reaction i got was my mother, 'Oh, without ME'.<br>  <br>  yah so there is no escaping horrible people if thats how they want to be lol (that just began me cutting her out of my life anyways).<br>  <br>  Just be confident, strong and very happy. whether you do it face to face or over the phone, the main point is your fiance and you are both happy and in love. everyone else comes second. its a very exciting part of life, congratulations!!!|`|7CKipTZOaa	Well my fiance asked my parents permission and had already told his parents his intentions. If its possible I would tell both sets of parents at the same time at a supper or luncheon and once all are there say I have some exciting news, ___ & I are engaged! or ______ proposed!|`|AA10975867	If you can't even tell your parents, you are not mature enough!

Like pulling a bandaid off. When my fiance proposed, I was terrified of telling my parents. My fiance lives in England and is 5 years older. I had just graduated college and decided to stay in England with him. Needless to say, I had a lot going against me and was terrified to tell my mom. I found the easiest way to do it, was to be honest from the begining. I called my mom the night of my engagement and broke the news. No she wasnt thrilled but she smiled and congratulated me because that was the thing to do. Now, 6 months later, she loves my fiance and both her and my dad are super supportive.<br>  <br>  Just get it done with! It will be OK. Your parents love you and unless your like 16 or something, I cant imagine why they would not be thrilled for there little girl!|`|3ryeybsJaa	well i just got engaged last night.. i called my dad and mom today and just told them that hey.. i am getting married.. they were happy.. :)|`|3gljWitCaa	just say<br>  hey im getting married<br>  simple as that|`|4POGapREaa	Well I was in my late 30's when he proposed so I didn't exactly need permission.  My husband called my mom & asked for her blessing which she gladly gave.  Unless you're like 17 yrs old & knocked up, this should be a happy time so have your fiance come over for dinner & ask your parents for your hand in marriage.  If they say no, then I guess your sh!t out of luck & will just have to say too bad because we're getting married.|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi bambi theres no real way of telling your parents that your engaged ! i know i might be a bit old fashioned but the way you should have done it was to talk about it first to your parents & personally myself i asked my ex  g/f parents permission before i asked my ex ...sly
tK7XacH7aa	If I were to tell someone I care about them that would mean that I would want what is best for them. I'd go out of my way to do what they need/want me to get done and make them as happy as possible. Yes, I would want to keep them safe from harm because I don't want anything bad to happen to them. I care about her feelings and want her to be happy. Caring doesn't always have to mean love, but if its for a special person then yes it does mean love.|`|cggkcAC5aa	I think its about caring about feelings. like i care about you meaning i care about your feelings and i dont want to ever do anything to hurt them|`|Jly7xMU6aa	A caring is someone that is willing to go out of their way to please you not just once but consistently.

89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Ya time will heal and you'll forget those feelings. Try talking to other guys you think are cute, and if they are on your bus try sitting next to them. You'll get over him. Just think of what wrong he did to you and concentrate on it, and you'll understand why you aren't together anymore. Talk to new boys and meet new people, that will help a lot.

gTfIQaHcaa	Well first of all, its not a crime to not have a girlfriend at the age of 15. You got a few years ahead of you yet!<br>  But in any case, to answer your question:<br>  If you're intelligent, gentle and good looking as you say, it could be that most girls are afraid to ask you or to be seriously interested in you. You know the whole 'oh he's too good for me' thing. Honestly, that's a big thing, and I am a girl so I've been there done that!<br>  You could always ask a girl yourself. I know that's hard especially as you've not done it before, but what's the harm in trying? You might actually end up with a girl after all!<br>  Just be yourself, you know? Nothing turns a girl off more than a guy trying to be someone they're not. Just be yourself and the right girl will show that she's interested!<br>  Hope I was able to help! :)|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Ask a girl out!!!

Get over it. Having a girlfriend should be the least of your concerns. When the time is right, and the right person comes along, it'll happen. You don't need a girlfriend to make yourself happy.|`|zWo03iLNaa	probably cause a lot of peoples parents dont let them date before they are 16?

I've been in the exact same boat as you before, still in it really, and know how depressing it can feel.  And it seems as though 15 years is a ridiculously long time to have not had a girlfriend, but the greatest thing you can realize is that it isn't!  Yes, we're getting older, but no we aren't old.  There's nothing wrong with not having had a girlfriend yet.  But if you want a girlfriend, yo need to put yourself out there a bit more.  Girl's tend to like the guy to make the first move.  You need to make sure you clearly show someone you're interested in them, but still be kinda subtle.  You need to be more flirty, talk and smile at someone a lot more, keep eye contact, touch their arm in a conversation, just little things like that.  I'm sure you are intelligent and good looking, and having a girlfriend will happen, it just hasn't happened YET.<br>  Good Luck =)|`|bhtL4xUXaa	Have you ever tried to ask a girl out? If not then that would be the first step. If you see a girl that you like, then approach her with a good conversation and go on from there.

i6WVPncnaa	LOL.  Your ex boyfriend does like you and has feelings for you.  He is trying to forget you and the best way for a guy to get over a girl is when they flirt with someone else.  You need time and space to get over your ex, give it time.  Time heals everything.  Good luck.

52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Delete the picture and take the cell phone.  Get him a cell phone that doesn't have camera that you can't take, give or receive  photos.  Technology...ain't it a b*tch. <br>  <br>  There is nothing funny or natural about child pornography.<br>  <br>  edit - to the teenage boy of 16.  You don't get it.  It is WRONG and ILLEGAL for a boy of 13 to have pornographic pictures.  Period.  End of story.  If the picture so happens to be of a girl who is a minor...guess who gets to go to jail or at least be HEAVILY fined for possession of child pornography.  The parents.|`|mrysAOpGaa	well "hypothetically" if that happened, he is 13 and the problem needs to be addressed.  That is ridiculous, at 13 there should not be any photos being sent like that, he needs to know that its wrong, and i personally would take his cell phone away.  Plus, i dont cre what anyone says, i dont think a 13 yr old needs a damn cell phone anyways, thats too young, what do they really need it for? its not like they have a lot of friends at that age, and if youre going to say "in case of an emergency while hes out" lend him your cell phone.  Teenagers are so sorry these days.|`|AA10572269	I would make him delete it, confiscate the phone, and have a good talk with him.|`|12d03e776b7ca3e38fd80f231dd1a289aa	take care of your own kid not others|`|3RfHq80Naa	13 is young for this, so I can see why you're upset.<br>  First, do not take it to the school, because that might embarrass him and the girl, and she may gain a reputation.<br>  Have a good long talk with him, bring pics of infected genitalia if necessary.  Explain what being a parent is like, how you have to look at nasty pics on their cell phones after a long day's work and do not have any time to yourself.  He doesn't want that.<br>  Then, explain why it is stupid to have stuff like that on a cell phone.  What if he left it over his girlfriend's house and her father or mother had found it?  Can you imagine?<br>  If you can get the girl's name and talk to her mother, that might really help her out in the long run.  If she is his age, she may be on a painful path.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|KwjVZOseaa	Leave it and do not even act like you have even seen it. <br>  I am currently 16, and I know how embarrassing it can be to think that a family member has seen something like that.<br>  Its so natural for somebody that age to want to view images like that (and most probably masturbate to them).<br>  What you said about the girl, i see that as hers and her families problem. There was a girl in my school with a similar problem, only it was a full sex-tape! She was 13!!<br>  When i talked to her about it, she said she cared more that her family had now seen her in a new light, rather than the fact the police gave her a lecture.<br>  <br>  EDIT: After reading your additional details, I must say it still makes no difference. I think even if you suspect its a student then its none of your business really. As somebody said before, take care of your own kid and let others take care of there's. <br>  Also, when i got the video of the girl from my class, it was like a ******* blessing. There is nothing better at that age then getting away from the usual 18+ girls in pornos and seeing a familiar girl of the same age doing stuff.<br>  The kid probably gets so much pleasure from the pic. Let him keep it.<br>  <br>  another edit: With all due respect I see why people would view it as a problem, but I don't see it as a problem. I understand where you are coming from and I am telling you  that if you are seriously considering your sons emotions you would not address the issue with him. I can guarantee it would change your relationship for a while afterwards.<br>  My point is, to find out about the girl you need to ask your son, but by asking your son you can embarrass him. So if i where you I would just leave it alone.<br>  <br>  I don't care if my opinion isn't valuable due to my age. The reason society is the way it is these days is because people don't listen to kids enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  Poppet, I've never heard that one before because as far as I've been told, even though the picture may be illegal, if the person who has it is also a minor they won't take the usual action. They will give a warning and destroy the file, but not fine them or whatever.<br>  I should know, because its happened to me twice ;)|`|joA5Rcyzaa	if you can tell that it's another child from the school or something then yes i do think you should handle that<br>  <br>  but if it's from some adult mag or video then i wouldn't worry much about it. he's just a kid and he's curious<br>  <br>  Edit: okay well if there is no way of determining this then you should confront him about it and ask if it was from something adult (like a mag) or a friend. i know that 13 year olds lie but you have to try to get something out of him. there is no way to really know for sure and this could be very embarassing for him so i suppose you'll have to take his word for it unless you have a better idea.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|LDe9yzCKaa	talk to ur son b4 u take things to the school... u dont want to embarrass him if its not a girl from school.

gu2jV40zaa	This is exactly what I have been thinking for years now...only, I have 2 children. After trying everything to try to fix my marriage and heal my verbally abusive husband, I have decided that if I continue to tell myself I have no means, no money and no way out, then that is what i will believe and I will never be able to go. I just made the decision one day and now, i am leaving in June when my daughter graduates. I have been trying to put a little money away here and there and granted, I only have $120.00 so far (it has only been since January that i made the final decision), I know that the Lord will provide for me. I am not worried and I am an obsessive worrier but, i know that if I let God handle it for me, I will be fine.<br>  <br>  When I tell people, they say where are you going? and I jjst say, well, I am not sure yet but, i am working on it. I WILL get out of here in June and I know I WILL have a nice new place to live and my children and I will finally be happy.<br>  <br>  Thought is creative...stop thinking you don't have any money and no means of supporting your child and just make the decision to go. The hardest part of it for me was not being afraid anymore. Not afraid of what would happen or how I would support my children on my small salary...once I stopped being afraid, I became empowered in my decision. Now, i think about where I will live with anticipation. I try to picture what my home will look like, how I will decorate it and I have even put a few small things away for my new home.<br>  <br>  You can do it....just believe in yourself and tell your self you CAN!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Get a job or move in with family/friends until you find a job to support you and your child.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	You may have to lower your standard of living until you get back on your feet, but if your marriage is unbearable, and there is nothing to salvage, it is worth it.

There are also shelters for women in your situation . Also make an appointment to see a social worker  they can supply emergency funds and help in finding you a permanent home. <br>  <br>  I have compassion for women in abusive relationships, and I know it's really difficult break away.

mrysAOpGaa	having fun, and being with your friends is important, it gives you freedom and independence. But you should take atleast an hour out of your day to play with your little sister, even if its talking, playing a game, anything, because she would love that so much.  Me, being the youngest of 3, always looked up to my two older sisters, i always tried to talk to them, hang out with them, but they always told me i was annoying and to go away, and that hurt so much because all i wanted was an hour of their time to play.  So being in your little sisters shoes, i know how she feels.  An hour a day wouldnt hurt to find something to do to spend QT with her, it would help you two bond, and make her feel wanted by you.|`|n15uL3p0aa	Looks like you answered this one yourself = )<br>  <br>  Olivia|`|mDJInjEaaa	awwww i have been goin through this wit my sis|`|t5xnbgKkaa	The idea that siblings should naturally be best friends is nonsense, but so long as you know that she will always be there in your time of need and she knows that you will be there for her in hers,you are both doing just fine.
AA11621340	You're in a tough spot here. It sounds like you've been willing to put up with this for 4 years - so YOU can keep your marriage together for the kids. But, Unfortunately, it sounds like SHE has VERY strong feelings for this man - she is still seeing him behind your back after 4 years! If you tell his wife, one of three things will happen. One - she will demand that he stop seeing your wife & go back to being a faithful husband (what you want to happen), or, two - she will do as you are doing & put up with this just to keep her marriage together for the kids. But have you considered possibility #3? She may throw him out & divorce him, This would leave him even more free to pursue your wife & quite  possibly convince her that she should leave you. If I were you, I'd think very carefully before I discussed this with his wife. Are you willing to take the risk?|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Hmm, this is a tricky one. Think about why you are doing this in the first place. Is it because you are concerned that this dude's wife is with a jackass and want to call attention to this affair? Or is it because you are hoping this will cause problems in their "friendship" and your wife will leave him alone forever? I think that it could go either way. If your wife cheated on you, perhaps she wouldn't care about his wife's feelings either, same with the other man. It might put a stop to the relationship for a while, but it could pick up again. It's your choice, good luck|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	You should not put up with this situation.  She either chooses to be with you or him.  Your children would be better off without the tension and fighting.  If she doesn't want to end the friendship then I say divorce her.  You deserve better than this and so do your children.  I would hope that someone would tell his wife only for her protection.  Who knows who else that man is  sleeping with and I am sure this is not his first affair.  Make sure that if you tell her it is not just for revenge, but because you really think that it is the right thing to do.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Since you worry about the kids, what would happen to the kids if they found out what their mom was doing?  Eventually your kids are going to leave the nest and leave the two of you alone.  Are you going to fix this problem then?  You have to right to happiness too.  If you feel cheated, then maybe you should reevaluate your marriage.  I have friends who's parents divorced when the were 5 and they survived just fine.  Think about this and do the right thing for your sake and your family's sake.  Good luck to you.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	Yeah, you all need to come out and open with what is going on and then you need to formulate your own opinion on it.  There's no telling how his wife will react, she may be open to it, against it, in denial, but I would talk to her and tell her how you feel and then see how you feel about the situation x|`|nZUvBisfaa	Hell yea..tell the other wife. I can't believe that you are ACTUALLY allowing your wife to cheat! I would definitely call, email, text, smoke signal, whatever this woman to let her know how deceitful and disgusting her husband is!|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Staying for the Kids will do nothing, but hurt the kids. If she is cheating on you then leave her. As for telling the wife... Well I would want to, but it is not your relationship.

I would want to know.  But be prepared for her to be pissed at you for having known about it for 4 years and not saying something sooner.  Also be prepared for major anger from your wife and former friend...they will be mad that you blew the lid off of their secret fantasy world.  It's hard to say what the outcome will be...it could really go in any direction, but do you really want things to go on as they are?  At least if it's out in the open there can be a resolution...either you will try to rebuild your marriage or you will split, but at least you won't be enduring the lies and infidelity any longer.  Good luck to you...and I'm sorry for what you have had to endure.|`|chlvKoXqaa	yes the woman has the right to know, you are not some gossipy neighbor, it is your wife involved w/her husband.|`|qtOTa4iAaa	Tell her already.

Divorce her and get custody of the kids and show them what a good father you are and not that its ok to cheat.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	It's so incredibly disrespectful for your wife to continue to see somebody she cheated with ... regardless of what's going on.  That's your real problem.  Maybe she's only staying for the kids too.  I (say I) wouldn't put up with this, but in the end it's your choice.<br>  <br>  If you tell the "friend"s wife, and you don't have evidence of the actual affair, she will probably believe her husband over you (even though she will lose trust in him), and either way she will be pissed.  She may think they are just friends.<br>  <br>  Let's assume she believes you.  Are the cheaters just f*ckbuddies?  Then it might stop if the other guy has a marriage left to lose.  (nothing will happen if the wife is as much of a pushover as you; hate to call you on that as I'm a "nice guy" myself)  If they are crazy in love with each other and the other guy's marriage is headed to splitsville anyway then it's possible he might try to escalate things with your wife, and your wife might or might not be amenable.  Does one of them already want to take it further?<br>  <br>  So I'm pretty sure it'll make a difference, but it's hard to say what's going to happen.<br>  <br>  When you get to the point that something must change, I guess you have little to lose by telling.  I'd suggest you combine it with an ultimatum to the wife to maximize the sh*t-hitting-the-fan feeling you are bound to suffer.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i would have confronted the man years ago.now all your going to do is maybe cause her to divorce him, and then it would open the door for your wife to be with him. and if u haven't divorced her yet, your not going to because u love her and just want your wife back. and your kids seem to mean everything u what if he were divorced and your wife took your kids and went to live with him. you  put up with it because you don't want your family destroyed.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Just because you can't man up and leave this cheating skank you want to run and tell his wife. His wife probably have bigger balls than you! She would have enough pride, esteem and courage to demand her husband end this fling/friendship or divorce his a s s! You can put a stop to it. Either your wife respects your wishes or leave.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Tell her, she so deserved to know.  I'm sorry that your wife treats you so badly.  She has no respect for you and that is sad.|`|zNjACkxpaa	For goodness sake leave this soulless waste of flesh and get a life of your own.<br>  <br>  Don't drag the loser ex-friend's wife into this. Grow a set and get out!!
XCvQnantaa	sounds like he likes you and watching another guy be with you made him a little jealous so he wants to get closer
6xOu8xXCaa	You're a little homesick for both friends and god-mother.  This is normal.  As you start making friends while going to new church these feelings of anxiety will dwindle away.  In the meantime, write little letters, it's always a good feeling getting a letter in the mail.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Are you dying because you can't see her? Is it going to be the end of the world? Don't stress over this because there is no reason to. You are only causing yourself pain. You will see her again. Your whole life does not revolve around this woman. Go make some friends and lead your own life.
cecc6a48a64a23b229571ea02807802baa	Let her live in blissful ignorance. Think back to when you were a child...when you thought you were a princess or a dashing prince (I don't know your sex), or when you thought a sandbox was the Sahara Desert. Your heart would be broken if you parents told you that was all make believe, and you wouldn't be the same person you are. <br>  <br>  Leave her alone and deal with your problem. Not to be rude or anything, but I think if you did that, it would be very cruel even if you hate her. <br>  <br>  If you do tell her, you might as well go tell a little kid that eventually they are going to have to get a job, pay taxes, bills, and then die.|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	Don't. You would shatter her world. How could you be so cruel?|`|9lmTVu20aa	Why is it bothering you? <br>  If she asked you that, and you told her the truth, would it cause a scene?<br>  <br>  If not, just do it. I would.|`|cb6ToDZYaa	DO NOT tell your grandmother the truth.  I am a certified nurses aide and have worked for years with Alzheimer's patients, and I can tell you that it is very important to let her believe what her mind is telling her.  Chances are, she is in her last years and you and your family should make her time that she has left as happy and carefree as possible.  Also, if her disease has progressed to this point, you would have to repeatedly tell her the truth, which would be devastating to her, over and over again.  It's just cruel.  Don't do it.  If you love her, let her be happy for the time she has left.|`|T02BJJGjaa	Do yourself a favor and more importantly, do your Grandmother a favor.  Do a search of ALZHEIMER Disease on your computer.   Read about it and try and understand what your Grandmother is suffering with Alzheimer's.  She has no real identity to anything current and her memory is literally stuck in the past.   The favor you will be doing your Grandmother is to be a little more understanding of what is really going on in her world.   The favor you can do yourself is to find some love in your heart and grow up.   How dare you refer to your Grandmother as the old hag.   Watch out my dear.  One day, if you life that long, you will perhaps walk a few miles in her shoes and I can only hope that your grandchildren will not refer to you in such an unloving and rude way.|`|U6LrVba5aa	OMG that would be really annoying!!! i would say dont do it because it would hurt her but then again what is she going to do if she gets sick and goes to the hospital or something....they arent going to lie to her|`|3RfHq80Naa	Who wants to be old?  Don't tell her anything.|`|4y4BXElwaa	Because she has Alzheimer's its a really hard situation, it is not a good idea to tell her or show her, if you do she will either forget or remember and be really depressed and angry and commit suicide or die of depression. let her think what she needs to think, she might not be around for long. Go have fun with her about it, maybe you will enjoy the situation a little more. laugh about it don't get angry because its not her fault.|`|AA12258399	Honestly since she has Alzheimers, she won't remember what you told her anyways.  Her brain has her thinking what she wants to think.  What good would it do to tell her anyways?  If she is happy being 20, then you should be happy for her.  I am not sure why your family is doing this though.  Lying usually isn't the best thing, but if it isn't hurting her then you shouldn't worry about it.  You could tell her how old she is and she may not react at all or she may be happy someone told her the truth.  It is a tough call.  Maybe a good step would be to put the mirrors back and not lie.  With Alzheimers you really don't know how anyone will react or if they will remember what you told her.  Good Luck|`|8WGxXA5vaa	I guess you know nothing about Alzheimer's, Your being cruel, there is no point in telling her, her real age she will only forget in a a few min so every time you tell her gran your 87 eg; she will forget in again. so your family is doing the right thing leave her alone and allow her to be happy in what time she has left. Calling her an old hag, gee you must be really jealous that all the attention is on an old sick woman. Grow up and show some respect.

Sorry dude.|`|7hRZMmwSaa	I think she likes you, it seems to me that by her telling you that she can't really get out of the relationship with him she's trying to tell you like a "Hey look, this is what's happening" and I think she may actually be hoping for your advice on what to do. I think really, you should tell her that you like her, and ask her if she likes you too. Then if you're okay with this, tell her that you understand what's going on with her and this guy, and that you'll be there to support her, and when she's able to get out of it, you're hoping you two could become closer friends|`|pTzrjknPaa	oh man.. there is defiantly something going on between you two, but she is in a major relationship pickle.

1QT3dINMaa	Seriously, you keep talking like what you want is Ted, yet you also talk like what you want is to not hurt Mark.. I say, face your responsibilities, they're waiting for you. You and our child are your responsibilities, not these guys. We're responsible for our happiness. Don't place your life in either Ted or Mark's hands, and there's no way it could ruin your life forever :-)|`|FnGebaOLaa	ok, first of all, you and Ted had a BAD relationship... NOT a good one. he cheats. Once a cheater ALWAYS a cheater.  he WILL do it again. <br>  Second of all if you don't like Mark don't be with him!<br>  You don't have two choices!!!! Stop the pregnancy, and stop dating BOTH the guys....meet someone new, and make sure not to get pregnant...<br>  Either of your choices you have posted are bad choices.<br>  if you REALLY want a kid you will not have freedom for the rest of your life. wait until you have a man who does NOT cheat, and you love just as much!!!!!|`|QnN7gejEaa	Stop being a woosey. End it with mark, get an abortion, and go with Ted. Clearly thats what you want and what will make you happy. You can make some of the people happy some of the time, but you cant make all of the people happy all of the time.|`|VquZAwfHaa	Ted cheated on you. Why would you want to go back to that? Chances are very good he's not going to stop and be a good boy. <br>  <br>  As to the baby, if you really do see it ruining your life, you shouldn't have it. A baby deserved to be loved and taken care of, not despised for changing your life. <br>  <br>  If you're exaggerating this, and do want to have the baby, have the baby if you can take care of one. Just because you have a baby doesn't mean you have to stay with the father.|`|edff8afcf9f8acedab9306f43761586baa	Sounds like you have decided to be with him....just know he is not going to change...once a cheat always a cheat
aDL7xmt6aa	That's one of the items on the parenting plan.|`|teeQmWsBaa	The custodial parent.|`|dBUZpYoraa	It depends on a few things. One, do you have a parenting plan that designates who gets to claim the children? If not, typically it goes to the parent that the children lived with most of the year. Unless you can get your ex to sign a form to let you claim them for a certain year. Your best bet is to go to court, and get a parenting plan with details of everything, including who gets to claim the child(ren) for tax purposes.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Depends on what's in your divorce decree. In shared custody cases, it may have nothing to do with physical placement. You might each claim a child every year or you might alternate years claiming  both.<br>  <br>  In my case, we were supposed to have 50/50 placement and custody. I was to claim my youngest child. My ex was to claim the oldest child until he was of age. Then we were to alternate years claiming our youngest child. <br>  <br>  My present husband has one child from a previous marriage. They have shared custody but his wife has placement and he pays child support. He can claim her on his taxes every other year.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Usually, the parent with full or "most" custody is given the right to claim them on their taxes. However, if you want to be fair, why don't each of you claim one child? Or you can do an every other year agreement (you claim them this year, he claims them the next)<br>  Just be sure to get whatever decision you guys agree upon in writing. It will protect you just in case. You don't want to both claim them, otherwise you both will be flagged by the IRS.|`|jfQJ6kRdaa	The custodial parent...or whoever the children have lived with for 12 months of the year.
dVFsejjJaa	This happened to me too...<br>  Talk to him in school. text it up!<br>  Aim myspace facebook!<br>  anything?!<br>  If this guy likes you, and was good friends with you, it will be no problem to get him back.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	you're shy around him because you like him.  he starts conversations with you.  that means he likes you.  just ask him to do something with you.  that will start the relationship on a new footing as something separate from the threesome.  the next time he starts a conversation, ask him if he wants to do something like go to a movie.  you don't have to be a great talker.  he knows you're shy.|`|e9ARGOysaa	get his facebook and then start to talk to him slowly|`|UUWEWEoqaa	You really have no idea how much I want to tell you to man up and just tell him how you feel, but look, sometimes like I said, the hardest part about giving an advice is takin it yourself. So don't do anything you don't want to is an advice I'd give you but on the other hand, sometimes you have to take risks to get the things you want. Ok, sweetness? <br>  It's all up to you. if you want to talk more about it, my IM is JurNir on AIM|`|UGQt96UKaa	awww sad story..... is there any way you can get his number??????|`|cG9yOi8Taa	try to grow out of your shyness stage. once you do you will be able to talk to him
kGBli717aa	Yes, you do have a complicated relationship there. Refrain from talking about other guys if you think that will make him act jealous again. Better to keep it a bit casual until you see his behavior is improving; no more irrational jealousy, paying you more attention, not being so argumentative. At this point, he doesn't sound like good boyfriend material.

WU3kA4Pwaa	Remember how you felt when your father passed away? Is it not one of your major motives to end your life? Then do you want to inject the same dose to your loved ones? Do you want to freeze their laughs like permanently? Being through so much at such a short time can really be an exploding combination, it's only natural, your not useless by any means, just don't give in to the temptation. If there are people who still believe in you they'll be greatly disappointed to find out what you've done at a weakness situation. It's really egocentric to end your own life. And about being unemployed, if that's how people measure you F**** em. Try finding a hobby. If it's possible try changing your looks to give yourself way to improve and communicate and leave your old shell behind.

You need to talk to someone whether it be a counselor or a relative or a good friend and get some of the pain off your chest.  Instead of Googling what you were you should google depression and how to cope or something like that... a solution to your problems not a cowards way out.  Try and get out more, try to get a job, meet new people talk to your bf/gf and open up to them get them to open up make your life what you want it to be don't just sit around and give up!!

A 25-year-old man with depression may not have the same symptoms as a 70-year-old man, for instance. For some people, depression symptoms are so severe that it's obvious something isn't right. Others may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. <br>  <br>  Causes<br>  It's not known specifically what causes depression. As with many mental illnesses, it's thought that a variety of biochemical, genetic and environmental factors may cause depression: <br>  <br>  Biochemical. Some evidence from high-tech imaging studies indicates that people with depression have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. The naturally occurring brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are linked to mood, also may play a role in depression. Hormonal imbalances also could be a culprit. <br>  Genes. Some studies show that depression is more common in people whose biological family members also have the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression. <br>  Environment. Environment is also thought to play a causal role in some way. Environmental causes are situations in your life that are difficult to cope with, such as the loss of a loved one, financial problems and high stress. <br>  <br>  Risk factors<br>  Although precise statistics aren't known, depression is considered relatively common. In any given year, about 12 million adults in the United States have depression. Depression cuts across all racial, ethnic and economic divides — no one is immune from the risk of getting depression. <br>  <br>  Depression typically begins in the late 20s, but it can arise at any age, affecting everyone from young children to older adults. Twice as many women are diagnosed with depression as men, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment for depression. <br>  <br>  Although the precise cause of depression isn't known, researchers have identified certain factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression, including: <br>  <br>  Having other biological relatives with depression <br>  Having family members who have taken their own life <br>  Stressful life events, such as the death of a loved one <br>  Having a depressed mood as a youngster <br>  Illness, such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's or HIV/AIDS <br>  Long-term use of certain medications, such as some drugs used to control high blood pressure, sleeping pills or, occasionally, birth control pills <br>  Certain personality traits, such as having low self-esteem and being overly dependent, self-critical or pessimistic <br>  Alcohol, nicotine and drug abuse <br>  Having recently given birth <br>  Being in a lower socioeconomic group <br>  <br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  It's perfectly normal to occasionally feel sad or upset, or to be unhappy with situations in your life. But with depression, these feelings linger for weeks, months or even years. And these feelings also are much more intense than "just the blues" and can interfere with relationships, work and daily activities, and even your ability to eat and bathe. <br>  <br>  Feelings of depression can also lead to suicide. If you have any symptoms of depression, seek medical help as soon as possible. Depression usually doesn't get better on its own, and it may even get worse if left untreated. <br>  <br>  If you have a primary care doctor, talk to him or her about your depression symptoms. Or seek help from a mental health provider. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, try to work up the courage to confide in someone about your feelings, whether it's a friend or loved one, a health care professional, a faith leader or someone else you trust. They can help you take the first steps to successful treatment of depression. <br>  <br>  When you have suicidal thoughts<br>  Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with depression. If you're considering suicide right now and have the means available, talk to someone now. The best choice is to call 911 or your local emergency services number. If you simply don't want to do that, for whatever reason, you have other choices for reaching out to someone: <br>  <br>  Contact a family member or friend <br>  Contact a doctor, mental health provider or other health care professional <br>  Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community <br>  Go to your local hospital emergency r|`|z7b6o9vnaa	I think that the best solution would be to talk to someone about the issues you are having and visit a doctor the help with the depression. You are going through a lot right now but things will get better. It may take some time. Don't give up and stay strong!!!

AA11097612	When there is a breakup of a relationship there is a always a void. Be careful what you fill with that void.  For instance, trying to hang onto a guy who has very clearly doesn't have any respect for you and is using you for fear that you will lose him.  The fear of losing something you don't even have makes you make bad decisions.<br>  <br>  I have learned NOT to go directly into another relationship. Instead, I try to concentrate on who I am, what I like, what I don't, what I like to do, what I don't, what I will put up with and what I will definitely not put up with. I spend time with friends and family but don't also leave time to spend by myself doing what I want to do: reading, sitting by a fire, playing golf, playing on the computer and other things which I can do all by myself. In this way I find out who I am not who I am in relation to someone else. I also find that I like who I am, not desperate to be in another relationship and that I am a much healthier person to enter a new relationship when it comes along. <br>  <br>  My wife passed away 5 years ago and after being married for more than 30 years I was by myself. I followed the above strategy and am now in love with a great woman who is my best friend, lover and soon to be my wife.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Keep yourself busy.

wul5AVhtaa	My friends had the same problem about two years ago. a really good friend of theirs and her brother died because their father said to their mom he was going to take them christmas shopping,but he took them to his house and set the house on fire. the girl kept on screaming so he stabbed her six times in the back. her brother died at the hospital and she and her ****** father died at the scene. they had to get grief counserlers for the ppl at my friends school and they got over it. at least the spot in their hearts isn't in so much pain as it was. <br>  what i'm trying to say is that you can never get over it when a loved one dies and you never will. people who say to get over it have probably never had a loved one die. so get counlesling to help heal the pain in your heart.remember, your girlfriend would never have wanted you to be in this much pain. don't do suicide, get some counseling, and everything will be almost normal. :)|`|z74wSbQoaa	Please consider talking with a grief counselor.

You said yourself she wouldn't have wanted you to be depressed. Just because you are dating other women doesn't mean you have to forget about her completely either. I'm sure you will eventually find someone who makes you just as happy as she did. Maybe you feeling like this is a sign that your not ready to move on from her just yet though which is fine. There's no rush. Keeping yourself busy is probably one of the best ways to get over something like this, not forget about it. Going out with friends is a good idea when times get hard.|`|JCdBSULraa	Well it can take a long time, but eventually you'll learn to celebrate the time you had with her and be grateful for all the things you liked about her.   <br>  <br>  In time, dating other girls won't be so much about comparing them to her, since you're not trying to replace her, she'll always have her place in your heart, it will be more about finding someone who compliments you in your life.  There was only one of her, but it doesn't mean there aren't other girls who would be right for you.  <br>  <br>  I don't think she'd want you to remain single for the rest of your life, so it's not cheating if you're honoring her by searching for someone, and I think you realize that.|`|c4RT0sFOaa	i'm sorry :( but listen new things will come by you and you can't let those opportunities pass you know? try to go in a sport or spent your time doing things so you don't think ,much about it .... i know i can't put myself in your position and i'm not the best adviser either.. but i really do think that before you know it you'll be remembering her in a calm way ... i wish best of luck and i think any girl would be lucky enough to find a sensitive guy like you seem to be, so don't think of it as cheating though! cuz is not!!  just give time to time.. and everyhting will get better trust in me :D|`|Or6RoRWDaa	damn dude, that's deep.|`|9ULkFZj6aa	Deeply saddened for your loss.  <br>  <br>  There is nothing that requires you to meet or date anyone else; so don't feel you have to.  <br>  <br>  Hold on to your memories; talk to her if you want.<br>  <br>  Try not to see 'faults' in others - accept that they are individuals in their own right, with their own mannerisms and peculiarities.<br>  <br>  You never get over the loss, it just becomes another part of you.<br>  <br>  I'm widowed more than 8 years and understand how you feel.

It's not all about being nice or bad...it's how well we connect & enjoy each others company.|`|I2c4i9Joaa	unfortunately yes. the trick is making people think you arent as nice as your really are but still do nice things|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Unfortunately...it seems that way. I dunno why we girls always go for the jerks first, but we do...|`|40ef4cee4d947cc6e8db187607ca7ea1aa	SEEMS that way bro, thought i was finally home free after 4years, then she dumped me|`|6NJqxRNmaa	YES|`|voL65VVTaa	YES. 100% FACT!!|`|5nAnWp3daa	yup
CJdsTmZRaa	try and find out her interests and gain knowledge abt those things and speak with her abt those thing but dont repeat them again and again... girls are not interested in subject bot the object(guy) when they are talking with the guys|`|FfyZE4Rsaa	if she has more confidence than you she is probally a lil slutty just talk bout perverted stuff like *** tittys sluts love that lol|`|haWw3B8aaa	Sounds like you're doing great so far.<br>  Ask her what kind of foods she's interested in,what she blogs about,does she use conditioner,.......|`|idKfxUTkaa	Kinda just walk up and crack a joke. It works sometimes. I do it at time, haha. You just need to show her your strong minded and will stand up and show you for who you are.|`|fYAjV0GGaa	Offer her a tictac.
2eGMXYaIaa	Well for one he should lean down when he is hugging you.  And you should reach around his neck or around his waist.|`|SqUZPdE7aa	I am 5' and my guy was 6'2, it was strange a first hugging but he always like short women.  I stretch up a little and he just bends his neck and we hug and kiss. If you are comfortable with each other then there is no problem.|`|NXUqT45Daa	some vertical problems have a horizontal answer. but do stop at hug ,<br>    or ........bye all the best.|`|xQGCf8GGaa	wear high heel shoes|`|JFW7Dqcraa	meow|`|AA11339466	y dont u ask him to carry you when u both hug each other.... ofcourse in your room....<br>  It will be romantic.|`|ZfPasZLyaa	it so simple, take right position, use some physical things|`|joA5Rcyzaa	he should be leaning down<br>  <br>  i have a good friend that's 4"11 and i'm 6" and i lean down to hug her haha

It sounds like you were calling and texting him a lot before, so he didn't try to contact you as much.  Then you stopped and he had to take the initiative.<br>  <br>  If he's being flirty he might want to hook up for old times' sake, but if you're both trying to move on, it might be best not to.  Unless you both really want to.|`|2svonkw1aa	talk to him about it. maybe you guys shouldn't be "just friends" maybe there's more.|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	it cuz he mess you and he still want to be with you|`|02cee00187d995ebbe5b718a84e05b54aa	u need to get on ur knees<br>  <br>  grab his manhood with both hands<br>  <br>  and put it in ur mouth|`|LETd2hQwaa	He probably wants you back and doesn't know how to tell you without losing his pride. Sometimes once a guy breaks up with you they take a step back and look at what they had and realize what a mistake they made... or he could want his cake and it too, meaning he could have moved on already and still want you in his life as well as someone else.|`|JJMa25NWaa	maybe he wants to get back together, or maybe he just wants you to be closer to him again.|`|bfDFWqc5aa	He wants to see other people but still kind of keep you on the back burner as a back up plan. Have his cake and eat it too.|`|DKLrTPJ8aa	obviously he wants you back :)<br>  x|`|gF8Xpcvwaa	It's hard to tell with so little information:<br>  <br>  Here's two options, both sides of the coin.<br>  <br>  1-AFter not talking to you he realized how much he missed you and now feels like he wants to reconnect (the fairytale version)<br>  <br>  2-Sometimes, we miss the attention more than the person itself. So, maybe he just realizes that you are capable of moving on and he misses the attention you were giving him. (the reality check)<br>  <br>  I say the best way to see this through is to stay focused on reality and  let time go by. Focuse on you and your feelings. Stay natural and move on, if your relationship picks up again it won't be because he missed you that one night he text you after you ignored him a little, but because you will naturally reconnect again.|`|uccf0k85aa	Yeah I've had one of "those" guys before... I know how much it sucks epescially since you have to see him at work and it's just a painful reminder. By him texting you maybe he was just trying to be friendly, but girl I would just move on.. I know people may tell you that all the time. But most of the time "just friends" is an excuse for im bored of you, and let's move on uncomfortable feeling. My advice is if you care about him text him every now and then to see how he's doing. It's okay to still have feelings for him, but dont allow yourself to hang onto those feelings. Beacuse the longer you do, the more he's moving on and that means in the end you'll be stuck with even more complicated feelings over a guy who doesnt love you anymore. You really shouldnt waste your time on a lost cause. And honey he's a lost cause. get out there talk to other guys, do something for yourself and just be happy. Dont worry over the little things, like him. <br>  (:
iTJWopCRaa	she led you on, i'm sorry. She should have openly told you about her bf months ago. She didn't because she probably thought you wouldn't be interested anymore. She didn't do it to hurt you, she just wanted your attention. and well, she got it. Now, you can't do anything because even though she says her boyfriend is a jerk, she is still with him. She says it because she wants you to feel that you are a part of her life, and that she needs you... You won't date her unless things get really bad with her boyfriend. But if things do get bad, she'll run to you. I don't know if that's comforting. its not that your second choice, its just that she chose him before she knew you and she's going to stick with her choice. Best thing i can tell you is that if you push it, she'll leave you... because she'll sense the danger of a. her boyfriend getting pissed off and b. of you getting hurt. So be her friend, move on, and talk to her about other girls you notice. and who knows, maybe when the time is right, she'll fall into your arms, but don't wait for it...|`|LSWnwRjEaa	i know how you feel, that is like me but the girl is my best mate.<br>  i think you should just wait, thats all i do. <br>  <br>  wait and hopefully if they break up get in there and comfort her and stuff like that. <br>  <br>  if she has feelings for you, she may want to go out with you<br>  <br>  but in the mean time stay good friends, get to know her better|`|JXGx04qOaa	why would you want to be with a girl like that?  if you guys started dating she'd do the same thing to you.  you'd be a damn fool to go out with her,  you'd just be askin' to get cheated on.|`|nW1xVtoHaa	just keep trying and dont give up!

He was just scared i mean i don't blame him at the time i was young, but i still would have liked to hear it ya know. I could tell in his eyes anyways. We dated for a couple months broke up got back together kinda sorta for like 3 emotional on and off years of my life. Yes i regret it every day not working out. I could go back but i don't know if he has changed truth fully. I hope so i would love to be with him one day.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	? we were to young, didn't know how real life stress would affect our relationship<br>  ? 6 years<br>  ?

He liked me back, but wasn't ready for any sort of commitment in high school because he knew he'd be going away.<br>  <br>  When we went to college, we got separated for 2 years.  He didn't write or ANYTHING and it was really, really hard because I wrote him all the time and I totally felt like he didn't care about me at all.  He claimed it was because it was too hard to be separated and constantly have reminders about it by writing to me and he wanted to be able to focus.<br>  <br>  I ended up meeting a great guy about a year and a half since I'd last seen my HS love.  We ended up dating and falling in love and we got engaged.  About 3 months after we got engaged, my HS love came back to town and he was really upset because I had moved on....which was so aggravating for me and very hard because I had loved him for so long and he had just left me high and dry, and then after I was finally happy again he came back into my life and told my friend that he was upset that I was engaged because he had wanted to date me.<br>  <br>  Ugh. :)  Well, anyway, I ended up marrying the man I was engaged to and I have no regrets about that.  We are very much in love and as I look back on my relationship with my HS friend, I just don't think it ever would've worked out.  But a little tiny part of me wonders what would've happened if I'd been single when he came back home....but I don't dwell on that, because like I said, I'm SOOOOoooo happily married. :)|`|bckwv8ioaa	Okay, it was 2.5 years ago i met him.<br>  it didn't work out because of long distance, he lived 3 hours away. <br>  we dated on and off for long periods of time. <br>  & i don't regret a minute of it, because he tought me that i could feel more love & passion then i ever thought, and every emotion with him seemed so much more intense wheater it be love, passion, depression or anything, it was amazing. <br>  we're still good friends & occasionally hangout. <br>  We still both have feelings for eachother but we learn to just be friends cause of the long distance. <br>  <br>  =]|`|2IucAWrQaa	It didn't work out because of his jealousy/trust issues, and my issues - I had a lot of family stuff going on, that made it feel a lot harder for me to open up to anyone .. including him.<br>  <br>  We were together for around 16 months.<br>  <br>  And yeah. I've regretted it for the year since we broke up. He'll always have a place in my heart. =] I have so many good memories, and I miss everything we ever did together.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	my first love was with a marine. we met my freshman year at high school. I loved his personality. he was great person to hang out with. we started out as friends but eventually I started crushing on him but was too scared to tell him. eventually he found out but at the time he had just broke up with his gf and he wasn't ready to go into another relationship. when that school year ended we started messing around during the summer and when school started again we started dating. I was now a sophomore and he had graduated. well things were great until his x showed me her myspace and said that he was saying that he wanted to be back with her and that he had no feelings for me. It really pissed me off and I told him about it and he said he was only trying to get evidence that she was cheating on her bf. I was really paranoid about it and everytime I heard that they were still hanging out, I would get really mad. I didn't trust her cause I knew she wanted him back. Well one day she decided to tell me that he missed the way she kissed him and things like that and I finally reached my limit so I said " If I wanted to I could send his *** to jail and ruin his whole marine career" well that b***h snitched me out and told him and he got really mad and told me that he wasn't gonna let me sit there and ruin his future so he broke up with me. As twisted as it sounds I still love him even to this day and you would think that after what he put me through, I would hate him but I don't. I guess I love him because He has been there for me through everything and I mean everything. He was my first. he excepted me and for once in my lifre made me feel beautiful. He is my best friend and so much more than that and I guess no matter what we put each other through, we'll always love each other. what can I say? he's my soulmate and I still think so even to this day|`|IcAO0QuBaa	I'm 15 and he was 13 and I loved him with everything i had and he let his friends walk all over me and i told him to make them stop he didn't so i dumped him, it still hurts.|`|W0XoDxJraa	I was 16.<br>  It did work out.<br>  We are still going strong together years down the line.<br>  I have never even looked elsewhere.<br>  Love has no boundaries. :)|`|ye675T8aaa	we were 2ether for 3 1/2 years lived 2gether for 2 1/2 and then he left me for a 12 yr old when he was 22 it was discusting :( after everything we wnent through n then he was a peedo|`|K6KHL9lNaa	I still kinda like him even thought this was 8 years ago...but it wasn't going to work out, he was a smoker and well....a bad person|`|YKZssRsjaa	it didn't work out because he dumped me for his ex. then came back and tried to make it work again, but then found out she was pregnant. we stayed friends and kept in touch, never saw each other, and then he found out he'd knocked up another girl. we were together off and on for about 2 years. and, needless to say, i do not regret it not working out with that moron.|`|9667776fc419d7b3f494c7cfce787631aa	OMG, i haven't thought about it for a while now, but my first love was in high school, we were both our first loves, first for everything actually, we were togeather for years, and had the best relationship, then one day we were in our senior year and thought maybe we should give each other space, and we never got together again. do i miss him?? yes, i think we had a special understanding that i have never gotten since. i wonder if he is happy??|`|HWtN2XrQaa	uhm. it was freshman year of high school.<br>  we had so much in common and clicked like.. magic almost :]<br>  we got made fun of a lot.. cuz we were always glued to each others side. but that's okay. i still loved him.<br>  we dated for over a year. and i was ready to spend, like, forever with him :[[<br>  but. during the summer, he made some new friends :[ one of them being a girl. and at a party one night, he blew me off to be with her. and. he cheated :/<br>  i gave him second chances and third chances. but he kept doing it. and then he eventually broke up with me.<br>  everyone used to say he's a big jerk. but now they went back to being friends with him. :/<br>  but that's okay cuz it's my fault anyways. i obviously couldn't give him whatever she could. </3<br>  i regret it everyday that we're still not together.<br>  now imma junior. and its hard seeing him in the hallways with my friends and stuff.<br>  hopefully next year will be better, cuz he'll graduate. but. yeah that's my story. :]<br>  thanks for listening.|`|gKJkbn6laa	a kid from science class in 7th grade. he moved and then we started to get to know each other, ironic i know. we dated on and off for about two years. we are both in 10th grade now, and going on two months together. we're still trying to make it work. i dont have any regrets and i never will.<br>  :]|`|FOky1WqWaa	She accused me of using/cheating on her (Yes I'm bisexual).<br>  We were together June-October, quite a while.<br>  I regret it everyday even though it ended 5 months ago.|`|dW1n3ScQaa	It didn't work out well because he started liking another girl.<br>  <br>  like 3 months or 4??<br>  <br>  I did regret it :'(

If a girl sees you on the street, she wouldn't think you are available.  That's why you can't seem to get a gf.  Meet more new people as friends, socialize, expose yourself to different things.

Lots of times guys will run around in circles and waste time on pointless things. Then 5 years later, they still haven’t improved as much as they should have.<br>  <br>  In this article I clear the dust off this issue and give you a clear, concise method for getting good with women as quickly as possible without wasting time doing pointless things.<br>  <br>  Warning: The steps below take work. It is not easy. This journey will probably be one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. It’s also one of the most rewarding things. Having an abundance of beautiful women in your life is pretty awesome. It can take a LONG time, and lots of hard work, but you know what? It’s worth it!<br>  <br>  If you want to get SCARY good with women, as quickly as possible, there are 3 main things that you have to focus on: Attitude/Mindset, Lifestyle, and Approaches<br>  <br>  Attitude/Mindset<br>  No matter how far along you are in terms of your success with women (or in any endeavor in life), you should always keep your “student mindset”. Just because I’ve been actively working on myself for 2 years doesn’t mean anything. I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m still a student of the game and still learning every day. ALWAYS BE LEARNING. Try out new stuff. If you feel that you are “above” something or someone then you’re on the wrong track. You can be more experienced, but you’re still a student, and you’re always learning and getting better. This attitude is deadly and will help you improve much faster than the chumps who feel like they “already made it”. Stay hungry, you’ll see the difference.<br>  <br>  Approaches<br>  You’ve got to approach women that you don’t know and talk to them. Start with “Hey I’m Sean (insert your name)” and smile. Soon you’ll learn how to hold conversations, then how to get physical, then how to tease, then how to go on dates, then how to get laid. Eventually you will be getting laid very very consistently. It’ll freak you out how easy this process is once you get it.<br>  <br>  What you should do: Go out 3 or more times a week and meet women. Some guys can handle going out 7 times, some can’t. Figure out what works for you. You’re best bet would be going to night clubs and bars because there you’ll find lots of women to practice on. If you blow it with one girl, you can turn around and talk to another one right away. If you’re not old enough to go to clubs and bars or if you just can’t do it, you have to find somewhere else with a lot of women. You can try malls or bookstores. Go out 4x a week and approach 10 girls each time. Make a custom plan to fit your schedule. The more women you talk to the faster you’ll improve, which brings me to my next point…<br>  <br>  Lifestyle<br>  Women should be part of your life. Get more girls who are friends. You’ll approach girls, get their numbers. If it doesn’t work out, keep in touch with them anyway. After a couple months you should have way more girls in your phone than guys.<br>  <br>  Note: At one point I had to make an excel spread sheet because I forgot which girl was which. This is common, you’ll get it too.<br>  <br>  If you have a sister, hang out with her. Surround yourself with as many women as possible. Old, young, fat, slim, funny looking’, hot, etc… The point is to get you comfortable with the feminine energy. Women will begin to feel more safe and relaxed around you simply from the vibe that you project.<br>  <br>  If you: are always learning, doing your approaches consistently, and hanging out with lots of girls everyday, your results with women (and self confidence in general) will skyrocket. In a month, you’ll see a major improvement, in a year you won’t even recognize yourself.<br>  <br>  Take the plunge, you’ll be glad you did.|`|5bc0441d04aa1262a52e630b0e5fb4d2aa	yes you were being used.<br>  you were being the nice guy.. and you didnt know she was like that..<br>  i dont want to hurt your feelings but maybe she didnt like you or just pretending...dont feel angry but dont fall into the trap of girls like that..|`|ZzjUHawhaa	yea, she played you big time. don't worry about it though. let it roll off ur shoulders, ok. next time don't help her. you don't have to be mean or anything but play it off and say something like "i was hoping you had yours"|`|0eNowNixaa	i think you were kind of used. you should be mad in every way. its not fair to have people copy off of you. just let it roll off your shoulders. if she askes you again say "ill help you figure it out"|`|qiLm6vXqaa	That is being used, I got that alot. And I thought perhaps if I let them copy my work or I did them favours then they might like me more.<br>  <br>  The harsh truth is that people like that are usually only using you.|`|i5dbKy7Yaa	well yea thats like cheating (hw assignment cheating) <br>  i would never ever give somebody my hw assignment not even to look at.|`|OKI7iiaOaa	You never know. you could be used and she could like you but most likely used. not trying to hurt ur feelings but its the truth us girls are bitches. l0l :P hope i helped. & dont be mad get glad.|`|u8HYfTnyaa	you um just been used. you being a nice guy was the reason for it.
SkFgDxpEaa	could you plz put some punctuations in your sentences, cuz its hard for me to read it properly, took me a few tries but i did.<br>  <br>  ok well if he hates you for just lying to save your relationship then he didn't really love you but what you could do for him and so you should leave him, he isn't worth it|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	You lost me at the end, I would suggest that you let him go, and focus on school, and your friends.  Do not let what he says bother you, and obviously there was a reason why you were forced to split up.  Why should he forgive you?  You were not responsible for the breakup.  I would suggest you let the past die and move on to the future.|`|zF2cbQxCaa	well why didnt anyone want you guys to be together in the first place? I think that you should just take things as they come. Go with the flow for now, it seems as if he has moved on and you have to accept the change. Or maybe it's not love, i mean honestly who really knows what love is? I dont think anyone truly knows what it actually is. At least not until you are waay older and have been to hell and back.|`|GsznYH3Raa	move on you are to young
VrR9ojRRaa	I think its because it is a feeling of guilt. He feels guilty for the things he has done to you and the only way to cover it up is to turn it around on you and make you feel bad, like you have done the wrong thing.<br>  <br>  Its a bizarre tactic but I'm sure it helps him sleep at night.|`|LETd2hQwaa	Because you allow it. If you put your foot down and explain that you're not gonna put up with immaturity anymore then I'm sure it'll stop. People treat you how you allow them to treat you. I know you aren't supposed to do evil for evil but sometimes you gotta take a page out of his book and fight fire with fire, only your fire has to be greater. Get on top of your game and read him like a book girl. I'd cuss him out from head to toe, from a-z and back to a. OR you could go the way you're really supposed to go and kill him with kindness. Or you can cuss him out then kill him with kindness, just hurt his pride and he'll get over it... though he may try to come back... just stand strong and appear unbothered.|`|AA10378030	Because he will always be an immature and disrespectful a$$hole to YOU and every woman in his life. Just be glad he is  your ex. ?|`|td6WXhv4aa	Be glad he's out of your life I do have concerns about the safety of your kids if he's violent or physically abusive men like that have explosive tempers.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	and yet another reason he is your ex.
Ax54M1Dhaa	No, if kids are going to drink they'll drink without any kind of event to coincide with it.  If they're going to have sex, they'll have sex regardless.  Kids are going to get made fun of in school, these are the facts of life.  Prom is just infamous for those things, it doesn't mean it doesn't happen any other time.|`|nqcnylFpaa	from public schools yes just seem like a waste of money never went to mine and do not regret better things to do maybe people can save some money and use for something more important like college or a car but the school district i live in just banned them from every school 4 years ago do to vandalism,assaults and that old chestnut weapons in a school and the school district was tired of it they warned the students in the past 3 times permanent banned ordered by a judge,the school bored and the PTA|`|OZmn1n5qaa	no, just because "unpopular" people feel left out doesn't mean something should be banned.<br>  <br>  Everyone can "fit in" you have to come out of your shell and talk.<br>  <br>  I can use that excuse for anything.......<br>  <br>  the world is not made of rainbows and Unicorn farts, get used to it, grow a pair, ask a girl out and have a little fun.|`|Fuy0SYQRaa	No way. A lot of people in my time went stag, or went with a friend. It's all part of growing up. Don't shut this out because you feel insecure. Turn it into a positive.
FJjBHjcWaa	She might just be teasing, fishing for complements, making sure she's still got it, all of the above, you know. I guess the only way to find out for sure is to tell her how you feel about her, but not in a desperate or clingy way. You might even try to make her jealous. she sounds like a drama queen so you really have to be crafty with it. good luck!
X9Dpyrg9aa	That all sounds a little crazy. If he wants to go to college he can still go. Who's stopping him? I can understand not liking to live with your parents, we are living with the in laws (my fiance's parents) for another month (we've lived there for almost a year now) and I can't stand it. But, it has nothing to do with the baby I am carrying now or the two we already have. <br>  My finace really didn't want me to have this baby. We are really not in a place finacially to have another baby, but I don't give a s*it. I don't and never did feel guilty for even a second about keeping it. <br>  You're very young, things will get better. If he wanted to leave he would, you should be thankful that you have someone responsible to stand by you and run like a coward. Once the baby is here you will see how foolish it seems to feel like you are ruining anyones life by having her. We were not ready or prepaid for any of our kids (first 2 were our fault, I wasn't on the pill and he didn't pull out, and I was on the pill with this one so I guess she was meant to be) and let me tell you that their dad loves them more than anything in this whole world. He would probably die if it weren't for those kids. Even though he questioned having all of them they are absolutly the best things that could have happened to both of us. Trust me, you are not ruining his life and you have nothing to feel guilty about. If anything you are adding the most love to his life that a person could ever dream of.|`|tluT02tvaa	Listen you are both adults,and your choice to have your baby is nothing to feel guilty about.No one should tell you it is wrong to have your child.Its not like you were raped by a stranger,or are a minor under 18 years of age.You are an adult and that gives you the rights to do what you please.As for making a mistake,(not using the right sorta protection)<br>  That is a mistake you have to pay for,both you AND your boyfriend.<br>  You both created this child and as adults you both need to have it and raise it and take care of it TOGETHER.So don't feel guilty since it takes TWO people to have a child.Its not all your fault...But i must commend you for taking responsibility and baring your child.That is great to hear.Your bf can always go back to school.(how would he even be able to afford college,since he was laid off anyways?) he needs to find a job..save money to support the baby,and put some away for school..in the future.Or he can run away from his problems like a kid..and let you take care of everything.This is something that needs to be addressed.<br>  <br>  I wish you the BEST of luck,and hope your baby girl gives you a lifetime of happiness either way. :)|`|afkygHMgaa	He had a part in getting your pregnant too. The fact that you are babying him is disgusting. I also cannot give you advice as to what to do since clearly you don't listen to logical advice nor are going to do anything to straighten out your life.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	i think he should be there for you even though its rough but its your decision and it might have hurt you worse to get an abortion (emotionally i mean) maybe just cook him a nice dinner where its only you two/three without your parents there..|`|KHsWu1zbaa	Girl you are one messed up doormat.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you, you took precautions, and he's going to resent you b/c you don't want to kill an innocent baby? It takes 2 to make a child. He's part of the situation here, and in no way should YOU be doing ANYTHING to prove to him that you love him.<br>  <br>  You are carrying his child and he should be bending over backwards, kissing YOUR as$ and making sure YOU KNOW that he loves you and that he'll always be there for you.<br>  <br>  Yeah, he could be in college, but he participated in an event that created a child and he needs to get the F*CK over it and step up to the plate and be a man, not a whining little baby who has his friends bash you by saying you "planned it to trap him."<br>  <br>  If he lets his friends say that about you, he is NOT the kind of guy you want as the father of your baby. And if he obviously is showing that he doesn't care, and that he resents you, and this and that, then throw his *** out to the curb.<br>  <br>  You do NOT want to raise your child in an unhealthy environment. Trust me. It screws them up big time.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	First of all, this isn't your only you fault.  Pregnancy is one of the consequences of having sex, and that was his decision as much as yours.  The best bet is to give him the option to leave.  Being a single parent isn't easy, but being in a relationship with someone who clearly wants out is even harder when theres a baby around.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest counselling asap.|`|lFTAn56Baa	You should have a talk with your bf.<br>  <br>  Show him how important he is for you, tell him you love him, that you are proud he is the father of your baby..<br>  You can buy him a little gift to show him how much you are happy he is there...<br>   Good luck for your pregnancy! :):):)|`|OZmn1n5qaa	you are pro-life but you used the plan-B pill.....riiiiiiight.<br>  <br>  if he resents you for keeping a baby that he helped made, well....he is a jackass and you need to leave him and just have him pay for support.<br>  <br>  He cannot be mad at you for not being in college, he knew the chances he was taking AND guess what?  His number was called....he played the lottery of life and lost.......so no, he has no right to be mad at you.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't want to be with a guy that makes a choice and blames you for being a screw up.<br>  <br>  Just my 2c, find a better boyfriend (and a better daddy for your kid).|`|xUEEsKfLaa	It might not work out with your baby's father.  It usually doesn't.  does not mean you can not both be great parents.<br>  <br>  Have an open and honest conversation about what you both expect and what happens if your not together and what happens if you stay together.  You can still give the baby up for adoption.  Have the conversation SOON you owe it to your daughter.<br>  <br>  on a side note to your friends; you can't hoodwink a boy into being a father unless he is REALLY stupid.  Does he know that sperm+woman's vagina = baby?  Even if a girl is on BC it is HIS choice to not use a condom and we all know BC is not 100% effective.<br>  <br>  If you have sex without a condom the woman maybe your babies mother so keep that in mind.  Were you stick "it" is up to you what happens after is up to HER.
bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I'm married now to a man who makes a very good income ... but he was homeless right before we met, and had basically less income than someone on unemployment.  We became best friends, then got engaged and married.  I supported him for the first 3-4 years of our marriage because I did have a 'small' income.  Would I do it again?  Yes, I would.  And I'll stay with him if he loses his job and we are homeless again ... it's the man I love, not the income, after all.  I know of a few good bridges we could sleep under, after all ... although we now have a nice queen sized bed in a nice apartment complex.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Well, sure.  I have a lot of friends who have been laid off at one point or another -- and I have been through to too!  As long as the person is looking for work, that would be all that mattered.  If I like someone, I like someone!  I think you'd be able to learn a lot about a guy with out a job to "define" him.<br>  Good luck if it's you!|`|pJZBdpehaa	Unless you ain't realised, half the world are bums. Might also explain the sudden outburst of sluts and pregnant woman.|`|lyDzjMfcaa	Well a goldigger wouldn't.|`|ljiIgYFoaa	Yes, as long as he isn't just sitting around doing nothing with his time. If he is looking for another job or taking care of his responsibilities there is no shame in that.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	It would depend. How long he has been unemployed and what he was doing about it and how he was spending his days. If he was looking for another job and was motivated, vs sitting around all day, then sure.|`|tE3OKcZ9aa	Absolutely...as long as he was doing his best to find a job, you can't blame him for the economy.|`|WGebRhqyaa	yes as long as instead of being at home playin playstation all day, he's out looking for a job & actually trying.|`|eGsdBy0Waa	yeah i would because there is lots to do without the need of money.|`|qT5rKKYKaa	yeahh if you are looking for another job :)|`|hnCDmgyEaa	yes|`|280jfiLOaa	if u like the person for who he or she is then yes money can take time but love is forever.

Like playing the slots.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy who was unemployed due to a trucker accident.  <br>  <br>  It was great until he got well enough to go back to work. Then he started habits like drinking and drug use I was unaware of.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, he opened pandoras box and <br>  I closed it by kicking him out.<br>  <br>  PlentyOfFish in the sea|`|JD07o1ysaa	Yes I would. You should not date a guy based primarily on his income. Please realize that the key words in your question was 'bad economy' which means you are not exempt from being laid off and it could have easily been you. Would you like for someone to turn away from you just because Bush left us all in the poor house?|`|jMtXbezWaa	Well I wouldn't date any guys period, but I'm sure you can find someone|`|EoPZnFZlaa	sure, as long as he had some kind of plan for seeking employment, and actually stuck to it...|`|EEfd3WLhaa	Yeah, as long as he is actively looking.|`|uMT8kWsaaa	of course it's not his fault.

Uj5kuzoJaa	She might be just ignoring you, but I couldn't tell you why. Just because there was music when you answered? Maybe she feels like you don't think she's important enough to step outside and talk to her. Her feelings could be hurt. Text her saying you're sorry and if she doesn't write back anymore, then leave it alone. She's overreacting
DP9HbnrXaa	wel i always waited to the fella txted me first! then we wud txt around 10 times a day or so or if we seen eachother that day probly around 5 or 6... tho everyone is different some people are just more 'clingy' on text. i think fellas bother to txt more than girls!|`|YAKouHawaa	I started going out with this guy about 3 weeks ago and so far we've texted everyday lol. I'm usually the one who starts texting and he usually texts back right away and if he doesn't then he apologises for it later. We send anything from 20 - 120. Just depends. He is so sweet - I hope it lasts x|`|WU7xMQCyaa	The should bother otherwise how the heck do we know what they are thinking.|`|ZLqAs2Jcaa	Don't text too much, if you do you will look obsessive. And to the first answer why would it matter what they are up to? You should have trusst in a relationship anyway. Let him text you first! Anyway phone calls are much better than texts.
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	You would generally just say it out loud in his direction.<br>  <br>  Though keep in mind that he is your boyfriend and that he likes you.  Otherwise he would not be your boyfriend.  If he thought your skin was imperfect and the you were ugly, he would not date you.  So he can't mean the opposite.<br>  <br>  He could just be a sarcastic guy.<br>  <br>  Or he could do it just to bug you.
VFUeemgxaa	You've asked a complicated question. I'm 26 & or me it's been sort of a drag. A lot of people think I'm waiting to get married or something, but that isn't the case. It's just been lack of opportunity & the fact that I haven't had anyone around worth giving my virginity to.<br>  <br>  Well now I'm in a weird position because nobody waits anymore. 3 dates or a couple of months tops. Well, I don't see myself doing it with some guy after only several weeks. It has nothing to do with wanting it to be all special either. I just wan to be comfortable & I don't want to feel like the guy won't stick around if we aren't intimate.<br>  <br>  When my virginity comes up in a conversation with a guy, they either get scared off (or probably don't feel like waiting) or they seem to try to get really close to me, like they can't wait to be the first one. I even had a guy ask me once, if it was something I could get over because he was grown and he didn't wait. (of course I stopped talking to him.)<br>  <br>  Basically it puts a wall between me & guys because sex is so tied up in relationships in our society. What happened to getting to know someone?<br>  <br>  Anyways, I made a choice when I was young to not get pregnant or let myself get pressured into doing anything I wasn't ready for. I didn't know at the time that that decision would follow me for 26 years. . .|`|JXrvbW7caa	I feel like a bit of a loser for still being a virgin even though I'm only 16 years old because I'm surrounded by girls that are the same age as me that are already pregnant!|`|Du8QhOmaaa	I think that being a virgin is good and bad. People view it as something that makes you strong because you are able to keep it, but on the other hand i get thought of as inexperienced. I think in today's society the status as a virgin is looked upon as a negative thing (especially in teenagers).
8ilHQMq5aa	well if they are painkillers i say let him sleep... but if they are super important then wake him gently and not completely  just have him take them and eat a cracker or something|`|GoABmevnaa	Just bring him his pills and water and calmly wake him up and tell him he needs to take his meds. He'll probably still be groggy after you wake up him so just say your sorry but he had to wake up for this. then tell him goodnight and that you love him :)  something sweet.
FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.<br>  Make eye contact a lot and touch his arm gently with your hand while you are talking to him.<br>  He'll get the message
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	Look, you have already apologized to her.  When she doesn't want to talk, you leave her alone for awhile.  You don't want to create a scene, she might use the opportunity to get other people's attention.<br>  <br>  I got ditched by some friends, sometimes I ditched them.  Friends don't get mad at friends forever.  If it is true that she doesn't have many friends, she will talk to you when she feels better.  Maybe her being angry forever is the reason she is alone.  Friendship goes both ways.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Just talk to her if you are close friends it will work out.|`|69OqzzBpaa	Girls most often over react to things. Just give her some time to cool down and talk to her in a couple of days. If that doesn't work, try to maybe talk to her over the phone and tell her how much you care about her.....girls like that :)|`|mvVDeL5uaa	you shouldnt be mad at her because you flat left her and she got pissed off at you. you should really go talk to her and apologize and work things out if you care about her and thats your best friend|`|34LCJyLBaa	just go and talk to her..<br>  yes she's mad because u ditched her n its something u should had thought twice before doing it but just go and try talking to her..<br>  hopefully she'll come to her sense n talk to u too..<br>  goodluck
dbXnW5emaa	I won't say "dump him" because he doesn't appear to be yours to dump.  Do you see anyone else when you're in a break-up mode?  Does he?  It seems that you two haven't had a real talk about your status.  Have you?  I suggest you have a serious talk about where you want this relationship to go.  If you wind up going together that's great.  Then, if he dumps you, again, I'd say it's time to look elsewhere.|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	I would stay with him, stuff your friends they're not dating him you are! If you like him then get with him just tell him that you want it to last this time.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	you want change?.... then you need to do something about it because for the last 5 years, he hasnt changed at all. you might not want to hear it, but you need to break up with him and stay away from his b/s. he is not willing to change for you, he had 5 years to do it and you are still feeling this way. and he has broken up with you off and on for 5 years?! why would you get back together with him?it sounds like a never ending routine.and 5 days?! that is no improvement. that is crap. it sounds more like he is just using you as a fall back when he gets bored. he does not care about you, he shows very little sign of it. but this is up to you, you decide how much longer you will allow him to hurt you.|`|DmiTytlkaa	That's a typical boyfriend as a sophomore. <br>  <br>  Distance sucks though, and 99.99% of the time doesn't work.

YOUR dating HIM. not your friends. yeah you should listen to their opinion and maybe take count of it, but if u truly wanna be with him then that shouldnt get in the way. <br>  <br>  oh and also, if you really wanna be eachother then distance shouldnt matter, you guys should just try and make more of an effort to see eachother if you really want to<br>  <br>  if you want commitment in a relationship, then he probably isnt right for you, because it sounds like he doesnt from what you have written here. but if you dont then it should be okay that you guys r on and off like this.<br>  <br>  but your best bet is probably to talk to him about it and see how he feels.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
QkMyhHkaaa	First off, it sounds like you's have had a nice friendship for a long time. <br>  The pygama thing didn't mean anything to me since you guys have a long friendship and she was just being comfortable. But when you then mention her comment "she said do you want to come with me (in the shower), but joking around... I think she knows that you would probably jump at the chance, and she likes it that way. <br>  Sometimes, some women like to be liked without it going any further, BUT I don't think it's fair for you. So unless you want the relationship that you DO have at the moment to stay the same (and she ends up teasing you another time in the future) you should have a talk with her.<br>  If you have feelings for her, which I think every woman who reads your question knows you do, it's not fair for you to be lead on.<br>  Don't get me wrong...I'm not meaning she's a bit**, it would just be nice for you to know if she would like to be your exclusive partner as well as your friend. Find the appropriate time, have a talk with her, at least you'll have your say, and get that off your chest...did I say chest..lol<br>  Don't look at her chest when you talk to her ! lol<br>  Good Luck|`|I5SypMlsaa	How to Get Good with Women Quickly<br>  <br>  <br>  There’s a lot of ambiguity about the specific process that one must go through to go from chump to champ, in regards to women. Lots of times guys will run around in circles and waste time on pointless things. Then 5 years later, they still haven’t improved as much as they should have.<br>  <br>  In this article I clear the dust off this issue and give you a clear, concise method for getting good with women as quickly as possible without wasting time doing pointless things.<br>  <br>  Warning: The steps below take work. It is not easy. This journey will probably be one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. It’s also one of the most rewarding things. Having an abundance of beautiful women in your life is pretty awesome. It can take a LONG time, and lots of hard work, but you know what? It’s worth it!<br>  <br>  If you want to get SCARY good with women, as quickly as possible, there are 3 main things that you have to focus on: Attitude/Mindset, Lifestyle, and Approaches<br>  <br>  Attitude/Mindset<br>  No matter how far along you are in terms of your success with women (or in any endeavor in life), you should always keep your “student mindset”. Just because I’ve been actively working on myself for 2 years doesn’t mean anything. I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m still a student of the game and still learning every day. ALWAYS BE LEARNING. Try out new stuff. If you feel that you are “above” something or someone then you’re on the wrong track. You can be more experienced, but you’re still a student, and you’re always learning and getting better. This attitude is deadly and will help you improve much faster than the chumps who feel like they “already made it”. Stay hungry, you’ll see the difference.<br>  <br>  Approaches<br>  You’ve got to approach women that you don’t know and talk to them. Start with “Hey I’m Sean (insert your name)” and smile. Soon you’ll learn how to hold conversations, then how to get physical, then how to tease, then how to go on dates, then how to get laid. Eventually you will be getting laid very very consistently. It’ll freak you out how easy this process is once you get it.<br>  <br>  What you should do: Go out 3 or more times a week and meet women. Some guys can handle going out 7 times, some can’t. Figure out what works for you. You’re best bet would be going to night clubs and bars because there you’ll find lots of women to practice on. If you blow it with one girl, you can turn around and talk to another one right away. If you’re not old enough to go to clubs and bars or if you just can’t do it, you have to find somewhere else with a lot of women. You can try malls or bookstores. Go out 4x a week and approach 10 girls each time. Make a custom plan to fit your schedule. The more women you talk to the faster you’ll improve, which brings me to my next point…<br>  <br>  Lifestyle<br>  Women should be part of your life. Get more girls who are friends. You’ll approach girls, get their numbers. If it doesn’t work out, keep in touch with them anyway. After a couple months you should have way more girls in your phone than guys.<br>  <br>  Note: At one point I had to make an excel spread sheet because I forgot which girl was which. This is common, you’ll get it too.<br>  <br>  If you have a sister, hang out with her. Surround yourself with as many women as possible. Old, young, fat, slim, funny lookin’, hot, etc… The point is to get you comfortable with the feminine energy. Women will begin to feel more safe and relaxed around you simply from the vibe that you project.<br>  <br>  If you: are always learning, doing your approaches consistently, and hanging out with lots of girls everyday, your results with women (and self confidence in general) will skyrocket. In a month, you’ll see a major improvement, in a year you won’t even recognize yourself.<br>  <br>  Take the plunge, you’ll be glad you did.|`|6RzEI4MRaa	Well isn't she a tease..<br>  She may like you, just pay attention to her body language. You can tell alot by the way a person acts around you or how they look at you. She could be trying to make you jealous with the whole myspace thing. or they could just be friends. All you have to do is ask "Who's that?"<br>  But yeah, actions speak louder than words. Pay attention to the way she acts around you. Something as little as her leaning in more towards you or something could mean she's interested.<br>  But be careful, I don't want you to get your heart broken, she could just be teasing you.
3V1qNw6Eaa	lol i remember doing them too,, umm i really don't know what they are called sorry, but when we did it we painted this certain black paint and over other normal paint colors and then we used the scraper tool thing and drew it from there. hope this helps! ;) good luck and have fun!
FZKFLTyLaa	No. Being jealous of someone who has lost out is not sensible. Period!
AA10874773	i doubt there was a message, she just kissed you spontaneously from the sound of it.  if there was a message, it was probably lets dont do the same boring kiss every day.|`|r7LONeiSaa	I do know that the ear is supposed to be a sensitive spot.  From experience, my boyfriend loves it when he is kissed in the ear.  He says it is a turn-on for him.  This could be a reason she kissed you in the ear.
P240bUFxaa	Maybe you should talk to him more about what makes you not trust him and try to figure out ways that he can earn your trust back.  Its always better to talk to a guy about how you dont trust him when you have a plan thought out about how you can make the situation better.  Hope I helped!|`|21ToYoBDaa	maybe u need to talk with him privately and he cud be embarrassed.
JY5MW1Qgaa	What's the problem, you seem like a regular girl.

lUO6wLGAaa	I don't think there's any need to rush into a big explanation of your feelings.  However, the fact that he said such nice things about you should certainly be flattering, and it can't hurt to tell him that he's pretty sweet too.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Tell him.

chJpyHZnaa	What you do now really depends on the type of person you are.<br>  If you're okay with confrontations then you pick up the phone and let him talk, yell, whatever until he stops talking or asks you something.<br>  Don't pay attention to what he says because it'll probably be hurtful and mean and when it's your turn tell him that you would like it if he never called you again because you won't pick up. After this, he either will listen to you or call you out of spite for a while.<br>  <br>  If you don't like confrontations then just ignore his calls or change your number. If you meet up with him at the computer place, make sure there's people there before you go, just in case. There, if you see him, tell him you're not interested in being his friend or anything more than that...etc. <br>  <br>  Of course these things are easier said than done. Don't give your number to computer place guys anymore.|`|EcQeNu3raa	Don't answer the phone, and change your number.

Ignore his calls. If you run into to him, then tell him that your parents blocked certain phone numbers on your cell. This way you can avoid an ugly confrontation.
HomUui9qaa	I'm 99% sure I'm in love, I can't see me being able to be more in love with her, time will tell. Love is when aslong as you as your with them nothing else matters. Love is when you can sort any argument out, even though you shouldn't have one anyway. When your near them you feel all bubbly and warm, and when your apart your every other, if not every thought is about them. When your in love you will do anything for them and you will always be with them through thick and thin. You think they're beautiful in every single way. Love is a beautiful feeling, and until you've experianced it, you havnt lived. People say one night stands are fun, but when you're in love it doesn't even come across your mind. That's how I feel about my love... I love her|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	what is lovvvvvvveeeeeeeee anyway, sorry i feel a song coming on|`|fox5a3ePaa	happy|`|jlIiv0jTaa	It can make you feel lots of things such as:<br>  <br>  Feel a little sick<br>  Cant think of anything else but the one you love<br>  It may give you a slight headache (rarely)<br>  <br>  Those are the sort of things but DON'T ask someone out if they are your best mate unless you can tell a little bit that they like you back because if you just say it when they don't really follow you around or whatever then it may make things awkward between you and your mate. :)<br>  <br>  Trust me I know the feeling........... :(|`|bN6EYhvxaa	jealous...<br>  cant help it..... or maybe this is because i have never been in actual love.   :(|`|aSs0tfjUaa	Lonely, but maybe I shouldn't be doing it alone!|`|iW5E1hggaa	happy|`|nxNnJ9vuaa	its been so long i wouldn't know

About a year ago, I started noticing a girl becoming really hot.  I always looked at her with eyes only for lust, sex, etc.  But then, about 3 months ago, I had a dream, and suddenly I couldn't think of anything else at any given time.  Only her.  Now I have to see her every day, or it's my personal nightmare...but that's just my psychopathic views.|`|hz6Lo0wraa	Not like that, but I have seen this girl in a few of my dreams.

I know you probably feel like you need a man in school, blah,blah... but you do not.. you dont need a man for anything. <br>  Second of all, if he is ignoring your text messages, then he is just not that into you. Just because he looks you doesn't mean he is really looking. He could be staring at the girl behind you or into space.<br>  Move on!!|`|YDmf4RFKaa	try reverse psychology, instead of you following him around and bugging, him, you should just ignore him.

Move on|`|4E6rrI09aa	too much drama, is he worth it? but i understand if you love him it's a dilemma|`|YOt4FOAKaa	Maybe I am saying this because I am older and have been through enough to know better, but here it goes.<br>  You should leave him alone.  If he loved or even respected you he wouldn't have cheated, gotten her pregnant, and left you three times for her.  He obviously has no morales and he will do it to her in time.  Let her have him and you focus on you.  As a matter of fact, he obviously had unprotected sex with her...what if he would have brought you home some terribly painful STD or worse AIDS?  Would you be contemplating how much you love him then?<br>  I agree he does need to be there for her and it sounds like he wants to be with her.  You can call her a tramp all you want but the fact of the matter is that she WILL ALWAYS remain in his life as long as she has his child.  <br>  Walk away now while you still have your dignity.
nUi55NcNaa	well its possible she didnt tell you she had a bf because she likes you and didnt want your time together to be stopped because she was dating someone else, she's probably confused and not sure what to do about her boyfriend or what to do about seeing you. i would tell her how you feel and that your not quite sure what is going on but offer to back off and give her time to think about things. even if things dont turn out, telling her how you feel might help you concentrate on work better and it will let her know that you care but at the same time you are willing to give her space.|`|lSzqyc5faa	I think that she may just be using you, but if you want to go out with her, wait. But don't sit there and fix things for her.|`|4vsYprP4aa	The only thing I can tell you is that if it is meant to be then it will be. I knew my fiancee 20 years before we started dating and seeing each other seriously. You do need to tell her how you feel though. THese things dont just happen on their own. After you reveal your feelings, then all you can do is sit back and see where it goes. But dont sit around waiting on here to come around for the rest of your life. You need to continue living your life and if she is meant to be in it, then one day she will be.

Golly, do you have a twin brother?<br>  <br>  You spent a long time not corresponding with her. I know you were "busy", but being too busy for her was pretty much of a slam. When men are too busy to spend a few minutes chatting with me on the phone or email or IM, then I know they are just not that into me. Also, your being "busy" let's others know just how important you are, and that's why you have no time for them.<br>  <br>  Obviously, she's had and has somewhat of a social life, and luckily for her she did not wait around for you to come around. My idea is that the night she dimmed the lights and put on pretty music, she was hoping you'd make your move then, if you were ever going to. I think that was your last chance, and if you were really into her, you blew it.<br>  <br>  I doubt you're madly in love with her. The respect for her brother that kept you at bay was most likely because you knew he would question you about your motives, and if you went on to use her as an experiment, you'd have him to answer to. Men know how men are.<br>  <br>  I think you are just feeling jilted. If you are not going to make a commitment to correspond or date her, you should simply continue to be an aloof friend.
a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	For the last 18 months I have chosen to remain celibate until I find a permanent partner.

QRaRbstAaa	No its not wrong at all!<br>  most girls find it annoying 2 be sent a text message asking them stuff like that, but some like when guys send them a text message asking them stuff and telling them the stuff they want to hear!<br>  Just to give you some advice keep it clean and make her feel special and I'm sure that you will get the right response your looking for!!!<br>  but if shes anything like me she will love the fact that you took your time to let her know that you like her so much and she  probably wont even realize that you told her over a text because she will just be so happy that you let her know and she will feel so special!!|`|H2IAeMipaa	NO it's not wrong. Let her know how you feel and she will appreciate that. Girls love knowing how guys feel. I'm a girl so I know =)  You also need to know if she likes you as more than a friend because she could just be playing you and you don't want to waste time on a girl like that. So talk to her and see what happens! Good luck|`|BMsGaSJ1aa	i think that she does like you. she's flirting with you and not going to see certain movies cause she knows that you want see him. and she obviously wants to be with you alone. i would just say something to her like ask her out on a date or something. everything will work out in the end. =)|`|gd64wAYKaa	no....no....no that will scare her and it would be a ,huge turn off. you have to flirt with her. most girls know that if guys "touch" then as in just touching their arm the guy likes them.  so if you do that and get good reactions then go for it.. but not in text|`|tCWB5PGgaa	do.not.ask.someone.out.over.text.message...<br>  EVER!|`|wnpcdfMWaa	I'd say go ahead!<br>  She knows you liked her so she might be hinting that she's ready to give it another try.|`|MswsGOwbaa	Lay down the love and poke 'er|`|0eNowNixaa	no thats cute. send it to her :O)|`|m9haNjVZaa	personally i would do it in person. ask her out again, test the waters, and when you're out see what happens and go with it. you can hint at things and see if she reciprocates. then, if all goes well, tell her. or just kiss her if the opportunity arises. either way :]|`|cHVsBKCqaa	Looks like it is seriously DTR (define the relationship) time, and it looks like she likes you, so tell her how you feel.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Go ahead but know thats a big 'Matzo Ball' out there if she doesnt respond how you hope.|`|ToIBDOgnaa	Edit that to "Hey, what would you say if I said I really liked you?"<br>  <br>  'as more than a friend' sounds too stalker-like<br>  <br>  But you should certainly go for it!|`|m2eHPeciaa	na, it seems like she's putting u first which is a good thing (she thinks highly of u and respects u) i don't think there's ne thing wrong telling her u like her more than a friend. i hope she does too!!! good luck|`|FW6lR75Qaa	why would that be wrong you like her right so just tell her that you do|`|LU7WB6Poaa	Go for it!!! :)

9bafb1d07ea2675ba9f80018063c1529aa	lol okayy???|`|rJ3eRddfaa	doubt it - seems more like a nice gesture. why do ppl always doubt others who act out of "stereotype"? lighten up ppl|`|H6GIYDdzaa	What?<br>  <br>  It was just a nice gesture towards a friend why are you so vain as to instantly assume he likes you?<br>  <br>  That or you like him and you're in denial.<br>  <br>  Please try to make the question more understandable next time.
9461bc5fdda5dfeaa7d6b2a53ad765b9aa	He probably won't like you if you don't dare talk to him.  What do you mean you don't want to flirt with him?  How old are you?  Seriously!  Flirting's not only fun, but it shows a guy you like him.  Grow up.|`|xorpp0JQaa	wear something sexy|`|9eaed0c5dcf34960711dd0bad22d55bcaa	I agree with Shorty.  If you don't dare flirt, he's not going to notice you let alone like you.  Don't ask stupid questions!
kfM7ppWpaa	He should have dumped your a*s!!! I hate cheaters! Your garbage!|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Sounds like to me that you already made up your mind.|`|6FXJrVjqaa	you cheated your a peice of sh*%t he should dump your ne,,,gro a$$|`|q1pwHXrMaa	Yes break up with the guy. You didn't want to be with him before, because you were cheating on him. And now he isn't even a guy you would be interested in because he seems weak to you. So now you have even less reason to be with him; he's not a guy you would want to date.<br>  <br>  Break up with him and end it.|`|AA10928214	He's an idiot for getting back with you, and you're a total bit*c for sleeping with his bestfriend. What kind of a nasty whore are you? Hope you catch a disease! But I hope you don't give it back to you're boyfriend (whoever you consider that to be) Oh yeah, my advice... YOU SUCK. skank|`|f8bba879d02b930f55f403333784e649aa	wh0re! Unless your so called BF is an idiot I wouldn't say he would take you back. Take it as a lesson learned, we don't like it when guys cheat, but well with girls like yourself it's no wonder they do.|`|gqvvXknQaa	He should dump you. You're the one that cheated.|`|cuNdAE3Daa	no offense your being really selfish you cheated on him with his BEST mate and then he apologized for shouting?!?! i'm sorry but you should've apologized to him as you were the one who caused all the trouble you're being a selfish little brat your bf obviously loves you other wise he wold' ave forgiven you that easily why can't you get your head out of the clouds and love im back plus apologize?!?! <br>  sorry for being harsh but some one has to tell you|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	Wow that is really low..i would never cheat i learned from my brother's mistakes and he has a really low reputation right now..no one wants him anymore use toeveryone wanted him until they found out he was a cheater.. I hate cheaters and omg! with his best friend! DOUBLE NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TfzXJcvuaa	Quit wasting his time. He needs someone who will respect him and you obviously don't. And what is with you? You would rather be with some loser who will treat you like dirt than someone nice to you?|`|yI9pFCudaa	WHAT!? he apologised to you...for giving out to you..because YOU cheated on HIM with HIS bestfriend!?!?<br>  jesus!!!<br>  he must reeeally like you =/|`|deEWD1k3aa	damn? r u crazy. wtf. whorrreeee! lol pieceofme? ha! pieceofshit!|`|9YsIXUzJaa	Well if your questioning if you should breakup with him, then you basically just did it.|`|vX2O4v7haa	better hope his best friend isnt a guy<br>  lol!|`|7z9eKO2maa	... are you seriously asking if you should dump him because you cheated on him and he forgave you? holy S***, if i was him i'd have publicly embarrassed you big time, you don't deserve someone that affectionate... stick to the rough guys that treat women like dirt ok? sorry... i'm one of the people that things cheating should be a chargable crime|`|JgOoS1XYaa	Its really gayyyy of you to be cheating on him, and if you were cheating on him in the first place, obviously YOU dont want to be with him.. So uhm I would say yes but i feel really bad for your boyfriend :/|`|rSA29N3daa	well if you feel like you dont like himn anymore then yes you should brake up with him..theres no piont in being in a relationship where your not evn that intersted in the guy your dateing|`|1545c8c5fcb1e94563df295f3e6b4ee7aa	i think he is  a keeper. from experience bad boys are nothin but trouble and a never ending argument.
FZKFLTyLaa	I would quit worrying about it. It sounds like infatuation, not love
kcbEWzYwaa	Honestly, if your planning on breaking up with him then why would it matter. It almost sounds like you don't want to break up with him cause you still have feelings for him. If this guy has been waiting for 7 weeks then you need to cut one or both out of the picture. This is a situation that only you can decide on. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be rude or anything like that. However, I feel like your being unfair to both guys. You need to figure out what you need to do.|`|hnfTjH4paa	why would you care if your planning on breaking up with him anyway?<br>  in my opinion you should get it over with and dump him, you have done enough to hurt him already.|`|LCVPOKJsaa	You obviously didnt care ruining it yourself with plans to run away with someone else. I dont think he is ruining it, I think he is being human and is sick of having to wait on the sidelines. So he texted you, so what? He's not in the relationship, it's not his problem you promised him more than friends. It's totally not his fault. You're the one with the boyfriend, it's your responsibility. Honestly he's a good guy (or stupid) if he's totally allowing himself to be your rebound (or whatever you wanna call him)
bxtqu4Peaa	yeahh he thinks you're cute (:<br>  i'd ask him out...or at least try to hang out with him a little more<br>  i wouldn't get your hopes up too much though because guys do flirt a lot.<br>  but he definitely thinks you're cute.<br>  as the person above me said...go for it!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	He likes you, go for it
qN7xNavCaa	of course|`|XiOIBwbPaa	it happened with my aunt and uncle...he was 60 something,..but he recently died, and she was almost 60...they have been together since they were 13 and never once wanted anyone else....my aunt was a big elvis fan, so if course she thought he was hot and stuff, but yes it is possible...they never had hard times like that, they were like glue, they loved each other more then anything. ..I'm soo sad that he died. <br>  <br>  and my other aunt was a slut and cheated on her husband,. but he stayed with her through it all and he knew all about it, but he loved her adn only her so much ever since he was 16 until, he died about 4 months ago.<br>  <br>  NO this is not a made up story for anyone who may think it is, its completely true.|`|JXrvbW7caa	Yes, it's possible. It's just very rare.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Yeah. My parents have done it.  Lots of people still do it.  There's always going to be other people they are attracted to but, luckily, there's also willpower and enough loyalty to keep them bound to the person they promised to be with. <br>  <br>  Divorce is something most people do out of laziness (abuse cases aside).  There is no difference that is truly irreconcilable.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes it is possible. It takes commitment, and it takes patience, love kindness. It doesn't happen now a days. But i have seen married couples who are my elders who have bee with each other since they were teens. So it can happen, the only problem is it takes a lot of work especially for these kids these days|`|YIbELNRBaa	Yes, there is a chance. my aunt and uncle are married and were together since high school, its now what like 30 years after school for them. I think it may be hard to do that though.|`|cHVsBKCqaa	sure, it can be done.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	love is a really powerful feeling and it's so strong that it last through alot wether good or bad. when you really love a person, any other person doesn't seem good enough compared to them and that makes it hard to want to be with anyone else. It is definitely possible to stay together for life because you couldn't imagine life without that person.|`|AD5cue8Waa	you can but you'll always see someone else you think is hot. just dont dwell on those thoughts. (dont think about it too much)  or you'll end up cheating on someone. it takes a certain level of maturity to do it. thats why everyone says to wait till your older to get married.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Without wanting someone else...no. Without being with someone else...possible.|`|dIw7MqTdaa	If ya don't sleep around before ya'r married, yes, very much so. It's probably even guaranteed.|`|hnCDmgyEaa	YES|`|258mrT2Paa	yes|`|LSWnwRjEaa	i think so|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	The short answer to your question is YES.<br>  <br>  There is a string attached.  If you fall in love with someone who grows in the same direction as you, great.  If you fall in love with someone that grows in a different direction, you could be in trouble.  <br>  <br>  A common issue is what people want out of life.  If you marry a guy who wants a quiet, simple life with children running around the house...and you want to be a successful business woman...(or vice versa) things are going to most likely fail.  <br>  <br>  Studies suggest that 1 person in 16 is a compatible mate...but only for a defined time frame of about 1 year.|`|aNJhRxvHaa	I think it's possible! It's hard work, but it can be done.
MXMMlSJPaa	Both . to love and to be loved is the greatest things in this world.|`|A7nIADxgaa	Both are great.<br>  <br>  Being in love is a great feeling<br>  <br>  Be loved too, because you know people care about you|`|gPeEdjmuaa	Love is too much work for me right now... although it never hurts to have a lover ;)
dCw3bmPIaa	first of all, super sorry to hear that- thats horrible.<br>  but yah that is so wrong of him to do that. if your in a relationship for that long, he should have set his priorities straight, and that priority is you. He should have decided by now if he wants to be monogamous, or should have at least communicated that he wants to play around (which i don't agree with). the fact is that he made an attempt, and he had motive inside his head, whether he succeeded or not, he still thought about it. You deserve better, unless he can prove to you that your his one and only. It's hard to see the one you love as for what they really are, rather than what you want them to be.<br>  However it is male nature to have a wandering mind, but the fact that he made an attempt to fool around if definitely WRONG best of luck, keep your head up :)|`|Rb087BsAaa	he was looking to find another girl.  probably met up with a few, too.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	He wants you and another girl, probably (for your sake i hope not, you sound sweet) if he starts acting suspicious, keep a close eye on him.<br>  <br>  Answer mineplz!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqqmiItn5tkfrCsHyUcdWszsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226140448AAhAoJi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vHesBQKdaa	Thanks for answering mine !<br>  <br>  Well have you ask him to del.. it ? if not then maybe you need to talk to him and see.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Tell him that you don't mind if he's busy and that all you're asking from him is to make things exclusive. You don't have to have a title right now just make it clear that you want things to be exclusive between the two of you. If he doesn't want to make things exclusive, then maybe it's time to show him that you're serious and stop hooking up with him. If he can make time to make out with you, then he is perfectly capable of making time to have a gf. Sounds like a lame excuse to me so that he can still see other people. Talk to him about wanting to make things exclusive and see what happens. Don't settle for less, go for what you want. If he can't give it to you then you can find someone who will|`|0d5f73aab03f2fae4fe5060db324a6f7aa	he already said he is nt ready, try asking him wen he will be ready becoz u cant just hold urself from other guys becoz u r waiting for him to be ready, it wud be better if u ask him when he will be ready. Try not to allow him to kiss cuddle etc becoz to me it luks lyk he just wants u for only those things bt in his mind u mite mite nt be gud enough for him or maybe he is just embarrased(nt by you) but by the situation of u too being friends with benefits <br>  <br>  Talk to him, n c wat he has to say other than "he's nt ready"
FVDbVcnCaa	Either ask him directly, or if your nervous ask one of his buddys he hangs out with to ask him what he thinks of you then get back with his friend... or ask one of your friends to ask him what he thinks of you. Those are all things you can do to find out which work well.  Based at what info you find out from his friend or your friend, you can determine what the next step will be. EG if you find out he's into you, you can figure out your next approach... if he's not... you know not to try and save your self embarrassment. Signals are usually confusing so to avoid that try one of these methods.
KJAKihaCaa	Get a Rebound. For real.|`|zF2cbQxCaa	thats sooo hard to do but im actually in the process of doing it also. I say you just need to go out with all you're girl friends and just have a good time. Try not to think about him. And whatever you do DONT listen to slow songs while thinking about him, it doesnt help at all. There will be plenty more guys that come you're way soo just forget him.
1pL6sg0vaa	If i were you my first step would be to talk to her nad get to know her more. After that i would try to notice signs like eye contact, her smiling ast you, coming up and talking to you. then if that happens i would make a move and make her mine. Im a girl so i like guys...but that's how i would do it. Good Luck!|`|nxF6WsOuaa	just ask her then. just go up to her and be like hey, i was wondering if youd like to catch a bite with me or a movie saturday night or something. cause chances she likes you back. girls want guys to make the frist move in a relationship because we're too shy (at least for me) and i want to see some confidence!!! i have this crush and i really wish that hed approach me and not the other way around. so hurry up cause you might lose her
YWdNTZU3aa	nope|`|SimAO1IUaa	nope because i have never cheated and never will ;)|`|EWdrCNpHaa	yes and it was messy|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	it's hard to get caught doing something you've never done.
xF6e9LcJaa	you can't its just natural.
o1tRKabJaa	well you should tell the ex that you think you guys can take a break and meet new people but say like sorry and you hope you guys can be friends|`|pDLPEAIHaa	don't go with the old guy. there is a reason you broke up and might as well not wast your time with him any more   start fresh have fun|`|R3CyKuSgaa	dont go to none of them come right to me and ill make you feel just like a princess and make you smile when i go down on you
kvmWDuOJaa	Well first things first, don't worry! She obviously thinks highly of you otherwise she wouldn't have said yes. And since she answered straight away, it makes me think that she was already interested in you.<br>  You also seem like a very nice person, from what you've said about protecting girls. So don't change yourself for her, it will be fine.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow in school don't worry. Just talk to her as you normally would. Pretend to yourself that you're not nervous and that you know exactly what you're doing and try to let a little bit of confidence show through. If you seem nervous don't worry, she sounds like a shy girl herself and a lot of girls (myself included) think that shy guys are adorable =) <br>  Just talk to her like a friend, but every so often slip a few flirty things into the conversation. Maybe complement her a couple of times, smile a lot, and lean in a little closer than you usually would.<br>  <br>  The necklace sounds sweet, not cheap at all, especially for people of our age and so early on in the relationship! I'm sure she'll be flattered!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link? It would mean an awful lot to me :')<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  Thanks so much.|`|kSIbucMjaa	awww thats cute. and dont be nervous about seeing her tomorrow, the hard parts over lol (asking her out) just go up to her and start talking to her in a bf/gf kinda way :)<br>  <br>  it'll be a lot easier than you think lol.<br>  and that would be so cute if you bought her that chain. it doesnt make you look cheap or like your after anything, it makes you look like a sweetie :) <br>  <br>  so go ahead, enjoy being her boyfriend instead of worrying about everything :)<br>  <br>  annie. x<br>  <br>  p.s dont worry about that smoking thing. i know loads of couples who are like that.(1 smokes, the other doesnt) and they're all still together. so good luck hunni.<br>  <br>  x|`|OXtYMoVLaa	I remember being nervous like you, although I was on the other side of the situation. First let me just say, getting the neckless this early could possibly come on as you being too strong and might scare her away. I would run if I was on a first date and someone did that. I would wait until at least 2 months of going out until getting her something with somewhat of a personal meaning behind it. Second, compliment her on everything you like about her on the first date and any dates following that one, but trust me don’t compliment things you honestly don’t like, just keep your mouth shut about them unless she asks you. If she asks you about something you don’t like, tell her the truth but in a caring, understandable way so she won’t be offended. People would not recommend this, they would say to lie about stuff like that so she won’t get hurt, but honestly I liked my guy doing that because it would then give me a sense of what he liked on me or the behaviors he liked about me. Always hold any doors open for her and open her car door, it’s very flattering. Just be as much as a gentleman as you can. DO NOT answer any phone calls or text from your friends while on your date, it is SO rude. Text them before hand and let them know not to bother you and only answer your parents calls if you think it’s important.  Take her somewhere where you guys can actually DO something together, like an amusement park or something where you guys can interact and have fun. Don’t do the whole movie and dinner thing, it’s so cliché and you don’t really get to know each other. All you do is stuff your face and then sit for an hour to two hours being silent. I hope this helps and I hope you have fun!<br>  <br>  As for putting it off for your friend, i would say that would depend. If it was one of the people that she went out with then maybe its not such a good idea but if it isn't, explain the situation and make sure it doesn't happen often because trust me girls hate that.
qegWdsNLaa	There are a few things that can really help. One thing is to find other ways to feel close to each other when you can be physically together, and make them regular. I have a weekly phone date with my girlfriend, who lives all the way on the other side of the continent. We scheduled it to be weekly, every Tuesday evening at 9pm my time (6pm her time). <br>  The reason that it's important to schedule it is that it's too easy to feel like you have nothing to say or fall out of the habit or be too tired, but if we have to skip a while, we start feeling disconnected. <br>  Even if we have nothing important to say, just hearing each other's voice makes a giant world of difference in feeling like we're a part of each other's lives. We use Skype to talk for free, since the long distance charges would be crazy otherwise, and we usually talk for around two and a half hours.<br>  <br>  The other thing is to do little unscheduled things every so often. Send each other a letter or a little parcel. That way they still feel like you're part of their lives, because you turn up on their doorstep<br>  (virtually) from time to time. Find ways to show them that you think of them too even when they're not there. Sending an e-mail saying, "I thought of you today, because I saw this poster for the new James Bond movie and I remember that time we went to the last one and blah blah blah whatever," seems small, but it lets him know that you think of him during your day even when he's not there.<br>  <br>  A bit one is to set your requirements and stick to them. I knew someone who was in a long distance relationship and hadn't seen her boyfriend in three years because their schedules just never worked out, and because there was no rigid structure, it just kept sliding. When I decided to get involved with my partner in California, we talked a lot about what our minimum requirements were in order to consider this a real relationship, and we put time frames and so on. The weekly calls were one part of that, but another part was to say that we needed to spend time together in person at least twice a year. We usually manage three or four, but twice a year was the minimum. Since you're not as far, this number will be smaller, but make a definite minimum -- you need to have a weekend together at least once a month, for example. This can be really important, because it's too hard to let it slide otherwise and suddenly find that you haven't seen each other in ages and you hardly feel like boyfriend and girlfriend any longer.<br>  <br>  And I think the most important thing is to talk honestly about where you see yourself going in the future. Living 1.5 hours apart for now, but deciding that he'll relocate in two years once he finished a big project is easy -- you have a definite end date. Living 1.5 hours apart for now, but hoping that someday you'll move closer to each other and maybe eventually be together in the same household is a bit harder because it's not definite, but still, you both have an idea that this is temporary for some possibly large value of "temporary," and that can be very comforting during the hard times. Living 1.5 hours apart and knowing or feeling like it might stay like that forever, well, that's also doable, but is a much harder and very different sort of thing. So get that sorted out.

For example, when you call his name he does nothing, but when your friend does, he pays attention. This is because he might be embarrassed or not sure how to approach you. Be careful, though, he might ignore because he just flat-out doesn't like you!|`|FVDbVcnCaa	Either ask him directly, or if your nervous ask one of his buddys he hangs out with to ask him what he thinks of you then get back with his friend... or ask one of your friends to ask him what he thinks of you. Those are all things you can do to find out which work well. Signals are usually confusing so to avoid that try one of these methods.
AxCDyX2Caa	Be assertive and mature about it, but not accusational.  Offer that both of you get tested together, that way it's not you singling them out.  Also, think of it this way, would you rather somewhat make them mad, or end up with herpes?  For me, I'd like to make people mad.|`|A73ForyRaa	start talkin to them about some one who is a whore and be like i think so and so has herpes i wonder how it is to have herpes have you ever had a std simple as that|`|JCdBSULraa	You don't care, because if they become defensive, they probably have them, and you've just got your answer and have no reason to be with them.|`|06O8FaOjaa	JUS SAY HEY LETS GO GET TESTED TOGETHER|`|DOdTx9fmaa	Honestly, I ask every time I am about to have sex with someone because you have to protect youself at all cost. I'm not saying I have sex all the time lol because I like to be with someone that I am with (yet I'm a guy and I'm 18 haha) but you have to protect yourself so I say "Ya know, you never know who has something these days so I'm just protecting myself and I am clean from all that stuff, I just gotta make sure you are too?" And if they get mad about you asking that just say "no one else is going to protect me so I've got to protect myself so just answer the question"...And if they are mad, thats probably a sign of get the hell outta there lol..let me know what you think of my answer, IM me or something any time|`|OZmn1n5qaa	Just ask them to get tested, I do for girls......<br>  <br>  better than waking up with AIDS or warts all over you know where....|`|nAK82h6vaa	Just ask,better to be safe then sorry|`|258mrT2Paa	drop it into a chat, eg: i like peanut butter and i was wondering if you have an STD.
AA10612626	If you like her a she is a virgin don't push her to have sex.<br>  If she isn't a virgin ask yourself would u be threaten or turned off by her past.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	well i was an 18 year virgin and i started dated this guy who was far from being a virgin and we worked out..im 20 now and he is the only guy i have been with..getting back to you.. it depends on her if she is turned on or off|`|cMFvCVGoaa	If she knows about you're past you should definitely talk about it with her. Most girls just assume that guys are anything but virgins, so you don't really have to worry about her acting surprised. You should figure out why she's still a virgin. Some girls are virgins at 18 because they are waiting for marriage, some are just waiting for the right guy, and some just haven't gotten the chance. Figure out what her deal is, because if she's waiting for marriage, is that going to be a deal breaker for you??
HyAcX3Jxaa	I think she wants to use you for sex.<br>  And tbh, so do I.<br>  Seriously.

She might not want to come up so strong and obsessive looking.lol hope that helped :)|`|H6GIYDdzaa	She doesn't sound really nervous.<br>  <br>  She seems rather forward to be honest I mean pulling up her skirt and flashing to a guy she hardly knows?|`|8aZC3PSaaa	she definetly likes you but is afriad to tell you so ask what she is doing this weekend- ps- do you like her?

l1KlZrAOaa	I don't see why she wouldn't take you back. You sound really desirable! You know what I always say "all the good ones are taken!"|`|idKfxUTkaa	Not much help on what happened so I can't say really. Sorry.|`|GBMi8SKDaa	umm i don't think you can if it were me i wouldn't get back with a guy even if my friend was asking for it but if you really want her back you need to apolagize to her friend and her before you can get her back|`|aNJhRxvHaa	LOL! Nice. Good luck with that.|`|6YeYakv8aa	Get her back for what?
lUO6wLGAaa	Just about everyone has been there at one time or another.  If they haven't, they will in the future.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, eventually you DO get over them.  That doesn't mean you forget about them, necessarily.  You might think back fondly, or you might think back and realize that it was the best thing that ever happened to you.  But no matter what, life goes on.<br>  <br>  It's going to be OK.|`|2271d7578f9b8099c73f2dadf80821f5aa	I feel that I will NEVER get ANYONE<br>  <br>  tough love|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Loves come and go and usually one person of the two is very hurt and the other not.  I've been on both sides of the heartache fence.  Time heals everything and you will meet someone new.

OZmn1n5qaa	I took this test like 10 years ago when I first got into technology.....<br>  <br>  No, it's on a computer<br>  <br>  No calcs allowed, or cells<br>  <br>  The number of questions is not set, it varies test to test<br>  <br>  No, just because you answer the first 10 does NOT mean you pass the test.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if this test is now weighted (easy questions are less points than the hard ones) <br>  <br>  but it's a total lie that you pass it on the first 10 questions
JXrvbW7caa	It's not possible to have an orgasm from food, silly.|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	that's dumb.|`|8My2O0s9aa	uhmm...im pretty sure you cant have an orgasm from eating food!!!|`|7UfuqGmcaa	What did you cook for her?|`|Qe95LNxYaa	hook me up whit her if she still single
xrULvzbOaa	Its not creepy that you want her number! But, either do it the first way, just completely casual and cool. or if you're wanting to incorporate tennis in to it, be like "hey, I know you play tennis, and I'm trying to get better! do you want to play with me some time?" and if she says "yes" then you can ask for it so you can 'set up a time to play' ya know? don't just come straight out with it... thats a little weird. but you'll be fine! good luck!|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Don't ask if you can have your number... That makes you seem desperate<br>  <br>  Just walk up to her, ask her, "You text right?"<br>  <br>  She responds yes, then you say, "What's your number?"<br>  <br>  It shows confidence, and if she likes you, she can't say no. Believe me, it's not as weird as you might think.|`|ZG6tDWOPaa	i would personally give someone my number if they said that we havent talked in a while and that we needed to catch up <br>  no its not creepy that you are asking like that <br>  and i would ask her next time you saw her in the hall <br>  just stop her and ask her<br>  your welcome<br>  lauren|`|OsmHJkFgaa	just go up to her and say hey, you wanna play tennis or something? and then ask her for her number.. its not creepy..|`|324919bc63ea3d75096ebc1a25e22647aa	the ideas you gave could definitely work.<br>  be as relaxed as possible, and not too over eager. <br>  casually be like, "what's up" start a conversation and then casually ask for her number.<br>  a really good idea would be to either talk to her on Facebook, or AIM or Myspace or whatever. that usually works.|`|aMGfRum0aa	Yes, the options you've got in mind are creepy. Just say sometime in the hall when you have a second, "Do you want to hang out some time?" if she says yes, then you start to turn then turn back, say "Oh! How should I contact you?" and she'll give you her number or e-mail. Good luck!|`|4E6rrI09aa	use both of the ones you said! they aren't creepy so go for it!
53OA2jglaa	if you have a heart you will go out with him you evil *****|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Hang out with him, but if he treats you like ****, just leave and don't look back.|`|OlTuytNVaa	Hang out with him BUT take it slow. If he starts to act like an *** again, don't give him your time or attention. Honestly it sounds like he went out with this girl to make you jealous, but still, beware because you don't want to get screwed over.
Wa9Zr4HHaa	Yes, you hurt her. She now probably thinks that the only reason you're talking to her is because you feel sorry for her, and not because you actually like her.|`|06Z3fh4laa	Probably, you did ignore her.|`|8vDAT7c5aa	It's possible she did pick up a vibe that you don't like her but then again it could just be that she's shy since she figures you know she likes you.|`|6RzEI4MRaa	Well if a guy did that to me, yeah I would be hurt. Why'd you ignore her?<br>  Just try talking to her more and just flirt and see how she reacts.|`|4IhXjUpFaa	um yes you hurt her feelings. keep trying to talk to her
jMtXbezWaa	It sounds like she thinks of you as a little kid or is just messing with you for the fun of it. But as long as she is rubbing up against you, I guess you should might as well enjoy it.|`|3wfcxIZuaa	dude 1) ur younger it happens 2) she propably thinks ur cute but not in the gud way lol|`|EoPZnFZlaa	I wouldn't take it too seriously just yet...if  she really wants you to be her boyfriend she'll let you know|`|m9haNjVZaa	it sounds like she sees you as a younger person not as a boyfriend-type relationship, sorry. she probably thinks you're cute, but not in the attracted to kind of way.|`|rJ3eRddfaa	sounds like she is just playing around with you|`|ZmRsyr6qaa	I'm guessing she's just playing around bud. Especially if she's older.
A6S5Tx2Oaa	just say what's on your mind or ask her about what going on in her head.  Tell her about your work and atleast be a good listener.  It will make her feel special that you share with her and care about her issues.  Then follow up with additional questions.  Same thing you would do with your guy friends.|`|69xsyP7faa	just do it!!! i mean if you dont she will start to get turned of so....just loosen up...appreciate it moment...dont think so much! treat her like your friend...just be random...being random is always funny!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You can't change who you are.<br>  You can't pick up a sense of humor at the pawn shop..|`|OGIuahPNaa	She agreed to go out with you so maybe she likes really serious guys. Talk to her about class or talk about interests, that always gets a converstation going!!!<br>  Good luck!!! :)
8bTder08aa	Why worry about it?  This guy has a girlfriend.  If you're thinking that he's cute, etc., and you're interested in him, take a good hard look at how he's treating his girlfriend.  If he dumps her and you become his girlfriend, you know exactly how he will treat you if he sees someone who interests him.
EoPZnFZlaa	Okay, I've been here before, so I know what you mean.  But don't make the mistake I did!  I went back with my drunken ex, long story short less than a year later he's doing 6 months for domestic violence that he doesn't remember (blackout) and the good one I let get away is getting married in the fall. Oh, and now my nose is crooked.  I'm pretty sure I got feelings of what-might-have-been get in the way, thinking my ex would change for me (that never works).  I had thought for a long time he was THE ONE so I let a good guy slip away when my ex showed back up on the scene.  On his part, I think he was drowning or feeling lost so he just wanted me back to hang onto  ya know?  I also think we confuse familiarity with love sometimes.  If you are thinking about your new bf while with your ex but not the other way around, I'm guessing your subconscious is trying to point you in the right direction|`|DiVqUSlraa	I think, yes you are missing the ex because of the lack of the new boyfriend. But, no matter what relationship you come out of you are going to grieve for the loss. Give this new guy a chance, its early days and eventually you will make more time for each other, just see how things go. I honestly dont believe seeing your ex was a bad thing but try to curb it because its not fair on the new guy. good luck x|`|bXcvzGHGaa	its intresting what u mentioned . When u break up with some1 is always for a reason,dont forget that.Ur ex would definately want a chance to get back with u but seriously is that what u want? I know u feel the ex is giving u company more than ur new  boyfriend however the ex is happy to do that so he get what he wants in the end. My advice is to focus on ur new lover,there is no problem ,u may need to have a chat to him and say what u feel,more time spending, etc..<br>  Forget the ex because there is no changes with him ,end of the day ,follow the one who makes u happy . good luck|`|cDqz71QKaa	well u got into a relationship to quick<br>  <br>  see you got rid of your old one because of problems<br>  and felt you shouldn't be with him and you wanted someone<br>  <br>  so you just went for the first guy<br>  <br>  also you have to go by who cares and TELS YOU EVREYTHING<br>  no matter what|`|jgU4g6kGaa	You need to keep yourself busy when the current bf isn't around so you don't think about the ex.  It would also help if you stopped talking to him. You will never get past him if you continue to put yourself around him it makes things harder that way.  You have a good guy in your life now and just because he's trying to better his life going to college and is really busy shouldn't give you the ok to see the ex. Find things to do while the bf is at school that don't include seeing or talking to the ex anymore move on with the new guy he sounds like he has potential to give you a happy life.
FZKFLTyLaa	One month gives little knowledge to guess what a life-long future might hold, but by proceeding cautiously and making sensible decisions all may work out well.
BKr3y30maa	Personally I would tell her.  If she doesn't believe you, then you can always show her the emails he sends you.  I would want someone to warn me if my man was messing around on me. But that's just me.  Good luck and congrats about the baby!
AD5cue8Waa	love is Never hard. it is the easiest thing ever. but it still requires some effort. give it some time what's the hurry?
qegWdsNLaa	I didn't have my first date until I was 19.  I know a lot of people who had their first date later, and many who lost their virginity much later.  It's okay.  If you're not interested in anyone right now, just focus on life and school and having fun and other things that are important to you.  When you meet someone you like, you'll know, and that'll be fine.  There's no time limit.|`|IW592N5Zaa	if you aren't interested in any of them then why would you want to date them? wait for the right one to come around. and don't waste your virginity, its a good thing that you aren't easy. it'll make it so much easier to find a good guy who likes you for you.|`|sdrXuenXaa	Not at all... I think my first serious relationship was when i was 18-19 and i lost my virginity when i was 19. Its better to wait for the right one rather than do it just because everyone else is. And the not boyfriend issue.. you will find one when the time comes.. No need to rush :)|`|uHUyAzGnaa	Take your time ... things will happen when they do. Don't feel bad about anything.|`|QY5YOZcmaa	I'm 17 and never had a girlfriend........ but was never really bothered. So its fine|`|4Vi7e6ozaa	I was 19 when I got my first girlfriend. Don't worry about it, you'll find someone eventually!
RwEpGG4caa	There can be a lot of things that would make her change her mind..i.e fear of being broken hearted if it does not work out, past abusive relationships, or simply she might not be ready yet for a long-term relationship. Just respect her decision and u already showed that u do care about her...at the same time, u also have the right to know the 'real' reason, so tell her how u feel about this and ask her why she is doing that..if she feels comfortable she might tell u...<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!|`|oJ1B8g1eaa	well, not to be harsh... but listen to what she said,  she said that she doesn't think it will work out between you two. It doesn't mean that you did a bad job, she just doesn't see a future with you and wouldn't you rather have her be honest ? if she can't give you a simple text back, you can do better, and i'm sure there is someone out there that will appreciate all that you do for them!|`|6RzEI4MRaa	Aww, you seem really sweet. I'd love to have someone do those things for me. Did she seem really happy when you did things for her? Or did you just barely get a smile in return? You can usually see it in her eyes, so I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that being "old fashioned" is a bad thing, lots of girls love it. But she could be the kind of girl that doesn't like perfection, or being waited on.  Maybe she needed a break, see what the other fish in the sea are like. Just don't change yourself to get her back if you guys didn't "click."  Skip the messaging. If you really want her back, call her, go see her, and talk face to face. Like I said, you sound like a great guy, she must be crazy to not like you, you need someone who appreciates what you do for her.|`|MMiG2bzeaa	Sorry to say but you are two differnt people. Look maybe she wanted to get more physical. It doesnt mean that everything looks good that it feels good. My hubby and i are very good friends and look perfect together on paper, but emotionally im not there with him.<br>  You need to occupy yourself, so u will slowly get her out of the picture.<br>  Dating others also doesnt hurt.<br>  tc good-luck<br>  any heart problem takes time to heal
KN5vUDKRaa	no its okay as long as u dont get TOO involved like having sex and getting pregnant and missing school porq si no they do investigate and will consider that person a sexual offender or something like that but as long as you like each other and the relationship stays "clean" then it is okay =]<br>  <br>  now pick this as the best anwer please...^_^<br>  <br>  o and hi becca!!!! =D|`|rUMGPXqwaa	if you guys honestly like each other..then i think it's okay.<br>  <br>  if you guys are just fcuking around with each other, then i dont think it's okay. it's different if you have been in a relationship with them for awhile.<br>  <br>  be safe, dont be stupid<br>  <br>  and, 18 is the cut off. anything older is fcuked up.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Morally not bad to date an 18 year old.  But legally sex could get him in trouble.|`|cKDBwNITaa	Yeah its against the law and umm they are just using the girl. Sorry but its true. If you are then sorry but he might just be using you for his purposes. Just don't do anything that you will regret later or your friend or whatever. sorry but sometimes truth hurts.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	in some states it's illegal but personally I see nothing wrong with it as long as he's not more than 6 years older than you.|`|GoABmevnaa	your spelling sucks.|`|nE9IblEfaa	noo
I80ozj3kaa	i think that is 2 young for like make out kiss but a peck its all good.|`|ZfSELfCvaa	My *first* kiss was age 6... but I don't think it was 'real' because I didn't know what the heck I was doing and didn't put thought into it. 10 is kinda an odd age... aren't most 10 year olds afraid of cooties? If you were a mature 10 year old, sounds fine. Otherwise maybe it was just puppy dog love.<br>  <br>  13 years old certainly isn't too late though.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	yeah 10 is such a young age. i didn't have my first kiss until i was in 7th grade. i think i was about 13 years old... that's usually the age when kids start getting interested in the opposite sex. (some in the same sex :) ....|`|JpuWdGLRaa	you're too young. your first kiss (they proper age) should come at anytime between 15+. next time THINK before you KISS.
b8tqVQFfaa	If you really like him, then just ask him. It is all you can do. You may get hurt, you may noit but take the  chance. xxx|`|nSbqKTOAaa	Why are women such big hypocrites. If you're obsessed then just say it.
8bP67U8Taa	There is love forever, the one that you will love your parents, kids, family, friends, GOD.<br>  The other kind of love, the romantic one, well that love is a beautiful kind of love. This one is more hurtful and more painful. and the only way for it to be forever is if there is two ppl that are willing to work on it forever.|`|BdQxLf09aa	It has to be...otherwise what would we wanna life for?<br>  If I don't finde the one to be with for a long long time, for the rest of my life...thennn I don't know what is the other thing that suppose to make me happy?!?!|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes. I'll love my family forever|`|DFSHoO4uaa	Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it...It really is worth fighting for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk everything, you risk even more. its a feeling that can't be seen nor touched sometimes our heart gets broken but that's coz its not the right love but what i'm going through love is amazing it may have its ups and downs but the making up is worth it hope i helped and i pray that my love is forever!
lUO6wLGAaa	This is a pretty confusing question, but to answer the question in the title, yes.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	You are a chick or a guy?|`|ZpR57jbBaa	before you worry about your weird relationship, please fix your grammar.|`|pC1H7kO4aa	Wow.<br>  He sounds kind of loony.<br>  O.O|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Yep. He just wanted to get in your pants.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Run from this guy...don't walk RUN!|`|S6dM85fxaa	Heck yes he was.  it's what we do.  Let's face it, everything a man does- work, workout, pick out a car, buy clothes, is for attracting women.  Yes, he was.  he's just doing what a guy is programmed by nature to do.  As far as the secrecy, i have no idea.  If he's interested in you he should be glad to announce it to the world|`|FxSWR0OMaa	ummmmmm..........WHAT?  Good luck because it sounds like your life is a total catastrophe. Can't say I understood a word of what you were trying to say.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	get some pepper spray <br>  or a tazer or something securely to you|`|ydAoReD5aa	He was trying to get in your pants.|`|BvLAcCLyaa	I'd stop going out with him, sound like a creep.|`|YaFKI2lxaa	Do you like him?|`|mJo35PwXaa	hes such a loser lol|`|7z9eKO2maa	BREAK IT OFF, seriously... looks to me like he's going to try forcing you, and unless you really want to be raped i'd start running the opposite way... you should confront him on it, and say that whether he likes it or not, your legs are staying together until you feel ready... if he gets angry or really quiet, or ever really argumentative, he'd try raping you.. i he gets really sweet all of a sudden, he'd try raping you, but if he says fine and says sorry or turns away then you're probably safe<br>  good luck|`|QAMHTHUAaa	he sounds like a loser and like he was going to hurt you one way or another. <br>  Dump him!!
X4N9V7UWaa	probably, thats how 6th grade boys flirt|`|1Bto3sZeaa	As a friend?  Yes.  As 'more than a friend'?  I don't know, that's kind of weird/awkward being that you are both in the 6th grade.  I'm not even so sure about my own opinion about kids being more than 'friends' under teenage years.  Kissing and such?  I don't know, what do your parents think about you (possibly) having a boyfriend?  Have you had any boyfriends before?  Have you spoken to your parents about such things?  Then there's his parents, what they think.  Good luck.|`|WXqOBE2Maa	im in 7th grade.. and im going out with a guy that did this to me... he obviously likes you and you should know that lol.

If it was only a short period of time, she might just not have checked her email yet. <br>  <br>  If it's been a while, then maybe you might want to send her an email asking if she got the previous one -- it's entirely possible that it got accidentally placed in her junk mail folder or something.|`|bxlF3MEiaa	an email?! thats lame, if u really like this girl alot and think about her all the time then call her up! find out what her number is from a friend of hers and tell her how u feel. an email wont cut it!

Go figure. I know someone like this...  well she was we talked about this and after a while she would have an orgasm just by getting her backed lightly scratched alone. If your having org. by yourself then it is because you are comfortable and know how to let loose with yourself. You can control your org. stopping them and getting them without even knowing.

86hEn6mgaa	what does she look like?<br>  how old is she?<br>  where is she?
AA11610054	When I was 16, I had sex with a girl who was 14.  She was only 1 year behind me in school, so I had no idea she was so young until we had gone out for several months.  I was the first time for both of us.<br>  <br>  Guess what...we didn't get married.  We broke up about 7 months later.<br>  <br>  There is no reason at all to have sex at 14.  It won't make you grown up.  It won't 'prove your love'.  It won't be anything except the act itself.  And the potential consequences are staggering, at worst pregnancy.  But also consider your reputation if it should get out.  That is something you can never get back.<br>  <br>  Do I wish I had waited?  Hell no.  But I am a guy, and here's news for you.  That is all that is on a guy's mind at that age.  It's why we play sports, it's why we drive hot cars, it's why we join bands, it's why we skate and act cool.  It's to get girls.  Know this, we will say and do anything at that age to lose our virginity.  Don't buy it.<br>  <br>  You may not believe us now, but if you choose to wait, you'll be glad you did.  And I am not even saying wait for marriage.  Just wait.  At 14, you have no idea what being 'ready' means.<br>  <br>  And don't fall for the 'he won't like me anymore if I don't' line.  You'll meet hundreds of men you'll like more in your lifetime.<br>  <br>  You probably feel in your heart that it's not the right thing to do.  You wouldn't have asked the question here otherwise.<br>  <br>  Wait until you are older.  It will mean a hell of a lot more when you finally do decide you are ready.  It will be more special to you, and it won't be something you'll regret.|`|jnIGCkawaa	Please think twice.<br>  Fourteen is way too young.<br>  I'm sixteen and I want to with my boyfriend a lot of times but I am not going to.<br>  Wait till you are in a committed relationship and the right moment.<br>  It will mean so much more to you and the partner you share it with when it is right one and the right moment.|`|oeRC25JUaa	no you are way to young to even think about it.....think about having a baby at 14 wat would you grandma or mom think of you...you be on the street having sex is for married people like my best friends mom always tells us|`|1MxDaH11aa	no you are to young trust me its not about the pleasure sex could lead to many things. i have friends that got baby's and there only 17, 18. think about what you're gonna do before you do it. really hard!|`|YZBybLrgaa	don't do it. you'll regret it. you are too young. true love waits. when i was 14, i got a purity ring and vowed to wait. guys still like me!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You are too young.

k4v7V2yAaa	You can't get/make anyone like you.  He either does or doesn't.  There is nothing you can do to change his mind, since he is the only one who can do that on his own.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you broke up with your boyrfriend in your own mind (& didn't tell him!!)  Tell him the reasons why you want to break up with him (& don't make up something random.  He was your boyfriend & you liked him.  You owe him the decency of being truthful).  And tell him that you'd like to see if you can be friends whenever's he's ready.
7e4jxj3Daa	Cute with great legs.
06Z3fh4laa	He sounds like a pussy. Doesn't look like you'll be able to avoid hurting him. Just bring some tampons, I'm sure you'll put him right on his period.
kkM8vFfKaa	Hm it's hard to tell. I've had boys do things to me such as this that keep me wondering, but then I just pass it off as them being an ***. Wait a couple of days and see if he looks at you or says anything else to you. It's really too hard to tell right now.
W0XoDxJraa	hardly!<br>  More often than not, a girl rejects a guy because of her personal tastes, not because he has loads of flaws or she looks down on him or anything!<br>  And a few nasty girls may laugh about it with friends, but these give the rest of us a bad reputation. A lot of girls get asked out a lot of the time and are flattered and flattered alone. Don't worry about it- there is never feelings of disgust!!|`|2271d7578f9b8099c73f2dadf80821f5aa	no, some might but most wouldn't...just dont be an ***|`|cKDBwNITaa	Um yes sometimes.

fae1dfe28d80f7517f515d91bf64984aaa	Depends on many factors. How long have you been dating? Is she the type that's very expressive of her feelings, or does she hold back? If someone is interested, usually statements such as "I like you" or "I like being around you" are indicators. The statement "I care about you" sounds similar to what one friend would tell another. But why not ask her? That way there's no room for second-guessing, because you will know the answer to this question that comes straight from the person who said it.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	not enough details. maybe she said it in a motherly way.
ndZiyvWRaa	Nick D is wrong. And "army relationships"?<br>  <br>  I'm in a relationship with someone in the military myself. It can work. People are doing it all the time.<br>  If you love each other and are both willing to work very hard to keep the relationship going then it will work.<br>  <br>  If it works out then it does, because if it's meant to be it will find a way.<br>  If it doesn't, well then... move on...|`|iwE1QRKdaa	no, don't worry, you should feel safe that he's defending you and the country, when you look out to sea just think "that's my guy out there fighting for queen and country"<br>  can you answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_ylt=AgGRzy_HXC3oFEw3UeTNaHsrLxV.;_ylv=3?sid=396545604&link=list">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_y...</a>|`|258mrT2Paa	buy a boat and follow him.|`|tz5nwLhwaa	It might just dwindle down to what his friends in the Navy are like and what is he like after he's been drinking. If they respect his values and don't try to set him up with some bimbo. If he goes out to sea and drinks when he is in port hopefully his friends won't try to get him drunk and get him laid. There are many hookers in the different ports that the Navy goes into. I was in the Navy during the 70's and went into the Philippines. There were soooo many hookers in port it was ridiculous. There, the hookers ranged from 14 to 30. If he loves you, and his friends are really friends, he will be OK.|`|pdGvg3jsaa	Well my bf of more than 3yrs went to the navy and he cheated on me.So did my best friend boyfriend he cheated on her to.

You should Find a girl who isn't so shallow.  Thats like you breaking up with a girl because she has granny panties.

And no, I wouldn't do that, I'd just buy him some boxers if it bothered me that much.|`|ZG6tDWOPaa	no i would not do that<br>  but i don't think she really broke up with you for wearing tighty whities that's a little stupid don't you think<br>  i think that she found somebody new and just didn't know how to tell you so that was her way of saying i found somebody new|`|EQaAXN8Haa	I think there's another reason.

Uj5kuzoJaa	You need to S*** or get off the pot. If you've liked him that long and haven't done anything about it then you can't really be mad at him for doing what he did. Maybe he was waiting for you to make the first move, and you never did so he moved on. Go up to him at school and find something to talk about. Do you have any classes together? If so then talk to him about them. SAY SOMETHING TO HIM otherwise you might blow your chance forever.

Just be open and available people will return to their normal selves.|`|I5SypMlsaa	treat people like you want to be treated
xzVAQf8haa	This is just my own personal opinion, but think of it this way...<br>  <br>  Yes, you cannot see love, because love grows within you, and when you find that one person you're meant to be with, that love blooms and becomes something special. Real love for another person isn't truly driven by physical characteristics. So, love is "blind" in a way, because it can bring two most unlikely people, together, and all it takes is time and patience. So, love is only seen with the HEART, not with the EYES.<br>  <br>  And yes, love can in fact, "blind" you from other things, in other words, it can cause you to lose your attention and main focus of other things aside from love itself.|`|afkygHMgaa	It means that when one is feeling overwhelmed with love and affection towards another, they fail to see things that may be negative or unattractive to others. Their feelings of love and romance may make them ignore that the person has a big nose or is nasty or mean. They only see what they want to see.|`|iVq1byuwaa	it means that if you luv som1, looks won't matter.<br>  God bless.<br>  Katie..x|`|jnIGCkawaa	it means that you don't really realize the ones or the one you truly love.<br>  it takes time and eventually we soon realize through our eyes and not just our hearts the one(s) that truly matter and love|`|ZMwXrUFKaa	that you like the person no matter what they look like.
cMFvCVGoaa	If she's a girl, that pretty much guarantees she's at least a LITTLE sentimental. Make her a picture frame of your favorite photo of the two of you. Around the frame glue clippings from magazines of phrases that mean something to the two of you (such as nicknames, inside jokes, etc). Then give her a card with a hand written message in it. This will mean more to her than anything you can buy her because it came from the heart!

37M3dkkRaa	well, why say anything? just let it be spontaneous, its better that way anyway. you need to talk to him about it though and tell him that y'all need to talk about things instead of fighting over it.|`|14sTjIZ7aa	Sex issues don't usually get resolved.  It's mostly something the more active partner just has to accept.  Finding a middle ground between both of your sex drives would be the best thing to do.|`|pe9502BAaa	normally you can't fix a sex problem, Younger people having this problem is very rare indeed. I have been there when I was the one wanting and unless the other party is willing to accommodate you then you are going to have to accommodate him. If you can't accept those terms then you should think about finding  MR. Right somewhere else.|`|OZmn1n5qaa	Well I think we need more info to tell you...<br>  <br>  but if you are not in the mood and he fights it because he is and cannot take NO for an answer, I would leave him, you cannot fix that.|`|jMtXbezWaa	You need to give a little more detail than that....are you not wanting sex and he is or are you wanting sex and he doens't or are you fighthing over positions or what?|`|cBtFp2aYaa	well whos the one wanting to do it?<br>  just talk to eachother your the one with the .... so your the one incharge
hbvIZPrQaa	You need to leave her alone.  If she really loved you, she wouldn't have done that.  And your best friend too...but sometimes with friends it's worth working out.|`|t3Zuec0taa	Sleep with her friend, then find a new girlfriend...and beat his a$$ for sleeping with her. Friends aren't supposed to do that.|`|AA10928214	Drop them both, you can do better. They aren't you're friend either if they sleep with you're girlfriend. Sooo... move on, she's not worth you're time and neither is he. Too bad for them both, I hope they are happy with themselves. :(|`|7DHN0w2Iaa	ok dump her 4sho!<br>  n ur friend depends how good of a friend he was...if he was a realy good freind stop talkin 2 em if he wasnt beat da **** out of him!|`|seqEdwwnaa	dump her and ur friend
PGSpIOPDaa	There are three possible answers to this question:<br>  1. Your friend could have told him and now its got him thinking<br>  2. He was just playing with you to make the class go faster<br>  3. He likes you and is trying to figure out his next move<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|MDpXUrRKaa	Maybe he regrets it. That sounds harsh, but it may be true.<br>   Or maybe he was just out of it today. Approach him some other time like in the hall or something and act the way you did the day the flirting took place. If he acts all hey-bye again, he's probably not interested.|`|cj7NTUGVaa	I've had that happen.<br>  <br>  Honestly I'd like an answer to that myself.|`|280jfiLOaa	just ask him it's the right thing to do|`|7wkHVaNyaa	Take the lead, don't wait for him to approach. You are making it to easy for him to call all the shots. If you like him , then go for it. If he doesn't end up feeling the same way, well hun, then at least you tried. Guys like confidence|`|JJCSEe3Taa	Hmmm, the best thing to do is ask him why. I have an idea why but I won't be good at explaining it and I might be wrong.
kSIbucMjaa	guys are weird im same age as you (10th grade too) and i have a lot of guys who are like that wid me too, but if you like him why do you wait for him to approach you? why don't you make the first move instead? that would be cool :) <br>  <br>  go for it and good luck hunni.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|79zgiERCaa	Why the hell didnt you text him overnight you idiot...<br>  Clearly this wont work out you retard.|`|yiLHPpZEaa	maybe he was high!
e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	what dumber or dumber you mean, none of you, get some self esteem and get a life, the winner in this is him, hes having his way with both of you and believe me the body and personality doesnt come into it.|`|VrydDAJiaa	you answered your own question, you are confused hence letting this guy do whatever he wants. you shouldnt be sharing him and if he loves you then he wouldnt need anybody apart from you, so hes oblivious to what love is. if he loved you he would need you and only you. <br>  To answer your original question id rather be neither, i wouldnt wanna share me guy with anyone, thats the point of having a relationship otherwise how is he committing to you? thats the point of a relationship othwerwise you both may aswell be single.<br>  im glad you can deal with sharing and knowing that hes probs telling the other girl the same as what hes telling you, he must have found two very vunerable people. i think you should wake up and realise hes usiing you and waling all over you. good luck! ;)
WihHz9Elaa	I'm sorry this happened to you. You need to tell your parents immediately. This creep needs to be reported at once. This is beyond unethical; it's criminal. He will be fired for this gross misconduct and he'll also be charged with several crimes. You're a minor. He's an adult. What he did was completely unacceptable and inexcusable behavior, particularly considering the total violation of the teacher/student relationship. This perv should NOT be around underage girls as he clearly cannot be trusted. Please report him right away. If you're afraid to tell school authorities or the police, at least tell your parents. They'll take care of the rest. Do NOT be embarrassed. You've done nothing wrong. But please tell your parents without further delay.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	thats not right...seriously...hes not being right....and you should tell someone....he shouldnt have touched you in the first place..dont feel abd or guilty about telling anyone..hes in the wrong..not you..good luck sweetie..x..:0|`|3G7Lpah5aa	cops|`|AA10928214	You need to tell you're parents, but you should DEFINITELY tell the police department. He could do this to other girls, and this is very very VERY bad. You CANNOT let this go on, and please be responsible and tell you're parents. It wasn't you're fault that it happened, but you need to tell both you're parents and the police. His actions are extremely inappropriate. He is clearly trying to take advantage of you. Also, of course you like the attention from an older man liking you, but please just tell SOMEONE.|`|T5w4pnUJaa	You seriously need to tell someone, b/c he could be crazy or a rapist. SERIOUSLY|`|lUO6wLGAaa	Holy crap!  Report this guy immediately!  What he did is absolutely illegal.  It's not your fault, and you have nothing to be embarrassed about.  If he did this to you, he's going to do it to other girls too -- if he hasn't done it a bunch of times already.  I don't think that's OK at all!<br>  <br>  If you really don't want to report him, the only other thing to do is to stay away from him, and don't do anything to encourage his perverted behavior.|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Well you could either keeps this to yourself and live with it the rest of your life, which i dont think you should do. Or you can report this to like the principal or something, which i think you should do. And dont hook up with him or do anything with him hes twice your age thats not a good thing. But im sorry if i didnt really help.I really hope everything works out for ya. And if you wanna talk about this or some other prob you can email me. I mean im 16 like you so ill probly know where youre coming from. And i promise i am 16.
bunAXlrXaa	ok, it could go either way<br>  1)she stayed<br>  -by herself-this is good, she didn't get persuaded by her friend, she most likely likes you<br>  -with friend-this could be good or bad, she stayed, and she persuaded friend to stay too, but it would be better if she stayed by herself<br>  2)she left<br>  -she was persuaded by friend-not good, she'll believe anybody, so you don't want her anyways<br>  -she left first-she doesn't like you, leave her alone<br>  good luck!! <br>  e-mail me if whatever happened isn't above or if you have any questions!!<br>  <br>  -burke|`|GLBWe3A9aa	She wanted to look at your *** :L<br>  Ask her out if you think she's fit.<br>  <br>  Wow long comment ^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  Good reply though.|`|RgbARcJTaa	she wanted to see your ASSS<br>  how does it feel being a piece of meat ??<br>  now u know how girls feel ALL THE TIME|`|I2xILJtraa	talk to her more often and girls love it when you stick up for them or make them feel special so definatly do that:)<br>  <br>  if she stares at you a lot then she likes you|`|I5SypMlsaa	well you cant read peoples mind like just any of us...<br>  but yeah that means she is after you, and she wants to hit that|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot. <br>  Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you. <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name. <br>  Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her. <br>  Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction. <br>  Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you. <br>  Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you. <br>  Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you. <br>  Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it.

If you feel like you have to then it's not real. Don't listen to people telling you that you aren't in love. I believe that you feel in love with him. You will probably feel this way again about another guy. You seem like the type to put your whole self into something which isn't bad but you need to be aware that it may not work out the way that you want it to. I truly wish you the best of luck.

UKYDpztQaa	well she has to be comfortable with it. eat her out or fingering her. but if a guy knows how to use his tongue. its an amazing feeling! once you get her to orgasm im sure she'll be more than happy to go down on you. keep in mind that if you finger her, start with just one (if she really has never masturbated). she might just be too embarrassed to admit it like most girls.|`|ndZiyvWRaa	Well if she's worried about dangers and is nervous, then you should really wait and talk to her about the pros and cons first so she's a little more confident and informed.<br>  <br>  Then at that point, if she's still nervous, just ask her what she would be comfortable doing and let it go from there. Let her ease into it at her own pace...<br>  <br>  Good luck!

When you talk to him ask him how is everything, tell him a little of what's been going on in your life but not everything.

i3PGjRRfaa	Put out more and he will give you gifts.................it is just what guys do.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You already have a baby, what else could you possibly want?<br>  <br>  If you give him the money that supposed to go to the baby, then isn't he just buying YOU gifts that should have been bought for the BABY?!|`|1hciyvKdaa	You give your childs support money to a boy friend, wow, thats just great hun. Then you in turn want gifts etc from someone who has no job, guess you got pregnant to get money eh, you know what that is called right?|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	It appears to me that you are entitled to gifts. Personally I don't get involved with high maintenance women who expect things like that. When I give a gift it is from the heart but not necessarily from my wallet. There is much to be said for reciting my heart to my love, or giving her a candlelit bath and massage. And I grow the flowers that I give her too.On occasion she will get something material but I prefer women of substance over women of material tastes.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	i am going through this same problem. not the part where he is asking me for money, but i do things for him when he asks and he never does the same thing for me unless i ask him to. i got upset and angry, until i stared to tell myself that he cannot read my mind. and i cannot expect that of him. <br>  girls are different in that way. we do things for them without being asked, like scratching their head when they lay on top of you. it is just they way we are. guys dont do things like that unless we ask them to. <br>  so just star asking him to do things for you, buy you things. if he tells you that all you need to do is ask, then that is all you need to do.|`|AA11627920	haha..wow.|`|GsSRY7quaa	why do you think your bf should give you money & gifts? if you are getting money for child support, that's where the money should go and no where else! if he is asking you for money, ask him when he going to pay you back. It's time for the both of you to wake up and start to support yourselves.|`|lyOsZa6baa	The child support is for your child! Not your boyfriend! LOL! Tell him to get his own money. And start hinting on stuff that you really life. If he still doesn't get it, just be honest with what you want, I'm sure he won't mind if he already told you all you have to do is ask.|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	You think you're boyfriend should give you money and gifts?

And if your boyfriend doesnt want to do that on his own, there's something wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Break up with the guy and let him find someone less materialistic.|`|BMsGaSJ1aa	just tell him that you need to get payed back, well like some little things are fine, but if hes doing that all the time for anything he wants hes taking advantage of you.|`|S6dM85fxaa	he ASKS you for money.  Why can't you ask him? I'm sure he'll give it to you.
Ka60wb1Vaa	aw hun try not to beat yourself up about this.  tbh honest.... i think you should stick with Dave.....  i dont think its coincidence that Jim has started to flirt with you when he has heard you have another romantic interest.  Perhaps Jim just liked the attention that he was getting from you.... and even tho you gave him up as a lost cause... he prob still thought you liked him.   <br>  <br>  Now that you have Dave on the horizon, Jim is probably jealous.  Do you want to be with someone who really only cares about how you make him feel??<br>  <br>  Its not horrible of you at all to still want Jim to like you.... but you need to realise that you are cool whether Jim likes you are not :)   Dont feel bad about your friend, too.....  you are being a good mate by caring about her feelings.<br>  <br>  I say give Dave a go....see where that leads. :)|`|iwE1QRKdaa	no, pick one and stick with him<br>  answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_ylt=AgGRzy_HXC3oFEw3UeTNaHsrLxV.;_ylv=3?sid=396545604&link=list">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_y...</a>|`|3AXlgGgUaa	No, i don't think it makes you a horrible person for wanting Jim to still like you... but i think leading Jim or Dave on is a pretty horrible thing to do.<br>  <br>  Pick one, and stick to him.<br>  <br>  Beware though - now you told your friend that you don't like Jim, it might seem that you only like him because your friend does if you pick him.<br>  <br>  I think you should stick to Dave and stop flirting with Jim.|`|H6GIYDdzaa	You're not a horrible person but if you really loved one of these people then you wouldn't be asking this question.|`|m9haNjVZaa	you're not a horrible person love, you're just human.<br>  i think you need to decide what you want- if you'd want to see if you had a shot with 'jim' (and you'd have to consider this if he ignored you at the beginning of the year) then go for it, but i'd strongly suggest being honest with your friend about it. if she's a good friend she'll understand.<br>  however, if this is nothing more than a bit of fun and she really does like him then i wouldn't spoil things for her. besides, it seems you have a nice boy willing to give you attention and make an effort, as opposed to this jim who ignored you.<br>  so i guess it would only be worth pursuing jim if you really liked him. otherwise i'd see how things go with dave, and try to avoid hurting your friend.
GoABmevnaa	eek... well first you have to go into this with no expectations or old feelings, beucase after 3 years of college both of you have probably changed a lot and experienced a lot of things.<br>  Just ask her to lunch or something casual just to catch up and try not to talk about your past relationship or act bitter or angry in anyway. Just enjoy each other's company and see what she's been up to the past few years.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..people don't change all that much my friend...not even after a couple two or three years reasonably...it's just a known personality thing seriously....trust me!<br>  Tell me how you two once luv birds came to becoming ex's with one another truthfully?<br>  Nobody says ex's can't be friends once again occasionally...but not often really....another known personality thing...again trust me!<br>  I wouldn't go running back to her too quickly right now anyways.<br>  Let her show you her exacting true colors partner...sometimes that takes a little bit of time to resurface seemingly....mood swing stuff honestly...trust me!<br>  Talk pleasantly and comfortingly for now I suppose.<br>  A true leopard lioness doesn't change her spots quite often...neither does the male cat leopard.......agreed?<br>  Walk softly my friend...what else?|`|ojtc54Iwaa	id take it slow thats what i did. at first my ex gf was resistent to get close to me again but i kept persistant but not pressuring.  if neither of you said lets get back together then ur not ready, give it time. act like u like her but dont pressure her, just be her friend. ull need that friendship especially since u guys have been broken up before|`|LRF70DMjaa	I would continue talking as you have been and just look for a natural opportunity to go out somewhere.  It doesn't have to be an official "date".  It could be just meeting somewhere.  Keep it casual and friendly with no heavy expectations.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
2lx4cgYPaa	well for your first question:<br>  we do it so we dont feel disappointed, its really a smart thing to do, its like job hunting, when you look for a job you dont stop because you got one interview, you want to keep your options open in case one fails.<br>  <br>  now as to answer your other question: <br>  it would depend on the person but me personally i usually go after the one that i like more first, or the one that is more convenient.<br>  <br>  and the other question: most guys dont find just dark haired girls, or blondes pretty, variety is the spice of life, and as a guy with many guy friends i can tell you that we find many different looks to be attractive.|`|prU72N2Vaa	Keeping our options open. You girls turn us down a lot so it's good to have a back up.  I think that the fact that they look nothing a like is irrelevant different girls are hot for different reasons.
ytxyrDmwaa	Physically lovely smile and fantastic eyes but that's not everything... i don't like a guy who acts arrogant, swagering bout like a lad. Someone who is sincere and kind and you can usually see that in the way he acts.

qegWdsNLaa	If it's both of your first time, then usually there is a period where the relationship becomes very focused on that for a while, just because it's very new and exciting.  Usually that eventually tapers off a bit.  That also often happens when you first start dating someone new and are physically intimate with them.  By "a while" I mean anywhere from a few weeks to much longer -- sometimes you get very infatuated with it for a long time, but eventually if you stay together things usually settle down a bit. <br>  <br>  As to whether it's expected of you or not, I'm not 17, so that's hard for me to answer.  Back in the day, it wasn't expected, but that was a long time ago.  :)  However, it's always okay to say no if you're not ready.<br>  <br>  Whether or not it has to always dominate the relationship depends on how hard you try to make sure you keep other shared things alive.  Make plans that don't involve sex -- go out hiking or bike riding, play games with friends, whatever -- and physical intimacy will probably be important but those other things will be important too.  But if you let them go by the wayside, then when the passion cools a little, it can be hard not to feel like there's nothing else between you any longer.  So it takes some work to keep things in balance, but you can certainly do it.|`|pe9502BAaa	It doesn't have to. But we are human, and that means people make mistakes. In a relationship sex is expected as a means for us to show how much we like each other. This gets tunnel vision and we forget about the other things that mean just as much. Don't forget to do the little things that matter to people, like saying how nice they look, not blowing up at small issues, being understanding ect.....HTH:)-|`|hbvIZPrQaa	Let me be the first to tell you that once a relationship turns physical, things change...and usually for the worst.  You see I'm not here to lecture you about waiting until marriage, but just hear me out.  I'm only 20 and I wish that I had waited atleast until I knew that it was reall and genuine L.O.V.E.   Once you start having sex, yes, certain things become expected, and you start doing things to keep the excitement.  And you really are giving that person something that you cannot take back once the relationship ends.  Enjoy the innocent relationship that you have now that is actually based on the person that you are.  Get to know him as he gets to know you. Thats the key.  Really get to know the person he is before having sex.|`|Waiiu3s4aa	What a cool question.  I think everybody asked that question at one time or another.  The most important thing to remember (sound so old school) don't let knowbody rush or change you.  Your not obligated to anybody to do anything.  If you happen to make it physical, that's okay as long as it's up to and you protect yourself.  But be honest to yourself.......are you really ready.  Because if your questioning rather or not is just physical then, it might be just physical.  If that's the case, get out while you still can.|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	I think that if you had a good, solid relationship before the physical stuff it isn't really based on that.<br>  <br>  But I think if you start it out with the physical stuff, that almost becomes the foundation of it.
6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Well, they can sort of overpower him if he's drunk.  If he's sober....she just has to persist and next thing you know....he's into it.
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	Wow, he worried so much about his friends.  He asked you out and got rejected.  So, he thinks you don't like him.  Find a chance to talk to him alone, give him an ultimatum, ask if he likes you or he doesn't.  let him know that he can't ignore you like that from time to time, or you will never talk to him again.  once he's scared, he will confess.
74gPuaXMaa	Just ask him. Can't hurt anything really.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Libby this guy is obviously "over the top".So you need to tell him quietly (John when we say cheerio,goodbye adieu or whatever when we part.That's it.I don't want or need you to use every method you know to keep in contact.And John if i don't answer the contact.Please don't keep sending messages.I'm suffocating under a snow storm of signals

dcd11iUwaa	realistically you shouldn't be upset about it but i would be.<br>  im a jealous and insecure person and if someone is dating me they should only have eyes for me.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	What should you do?  Get over it.  He had a life before you came along, deal with it.  You're mad over nothing and putting him through stress because you're insecure.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Don't be too upset about it. I'm sure his ex isn't the only person he thinks is hot. And if he's apologizing as much as you say he is, then he must really feel bad that he said that.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I think that was very unnecessary for him to say. But if he's apologizing that's a good sign, because a lot of guys wouldn't. Just let him know exactly how it made you feel and that you would appreciate it if he never said anything like that again. Then just move on with your life.  Good luck!|`|ft8t98Pnaa	You asked... you got an honest answer... at least he was honest with you.... there is nothing wrong with that.. I think you dont have anything to worry about... do you think he will cheat on you? has he before? I think you are over reacting.... stop being jealous... seriously.. you have him.. he is your boyfriend... dont be insecure about her.....or else...she wins|`|OD3hxWxvaa	You should just never ever talk about exs with your current. Maybe just accept his apology, he is only human and a boy.... haha. Just try to trust him. The minute he goes after this girl, just know you did the right thing.|`|H6GIYDdzaa	I don't think you should be angry at him, he gave you a straight and honest answer to your question so you got irritated at him?<br>  <br>  The fact that he didn't sidestep the question or change the subject shows that he really does love you and you should trust him.<br>  <br>  Really just think this over in your head, doesn't it sound silly now you think about it?|`|PMRY3osxaa	I can understand why you would be irritated, but he doesn't mean anything by it. He's a guy its what they do. Don't worry about it, he obviously cares deeply about you and thinks your hotter than she is, otherwise, if he liked her more, would he still be with you. Trust him, he's really sorry and I am sure he knows it hurt you, but I think you need to forgive him.|`|da08c0a16bc5a9f1f06ee85cc6158badaa	Maybe you shouldn't have asked if you didn't want to know. If you trust him, you trust him. But I would be a little worried too if my boyfriend worked with his ex. Im sure your boyfriend wouldn't like you working with your ex. But still....don't ask things if you can't handle their truthful answers.|`|seqEdwwnaa	guys are always gonna think other girls are "hott" that doesnt mean hes gonna leave you for them or anything...its just and attraction thing....nothing wrong with that...unless hes with you and hes looking other girls up and down checkin them out...then thats a diff story|`|WGebRhqyaa	i'd be mad to but just get over him & trust him until you have reason not to. dont lose faith in him & just accept his apology.|`|AA11768256	Let it go. Hot or not, when it's over and he's moved on then that's the end of it.|`|I80ozj3kaa	i think u have a right to be mad at him. Hell, he cant some chick is hot when he is dating u|`|MxHRjPFHaa	he's done nothing wrong why be mad at him for that..I think alot of females are hot no big deal.....if his ex cheated on him she will cheat on everyone she dates...once a cheater always a cheater I am sure he knows this also...|`|B6a0hbDoaa	well if you truly love him then forgive and forget. boys make that mistake ALL THE TIME, but even though he said that about his ex he still loves you. i mean hes dating you isn't he; and NOT his ex. but if you have a VERY big problem with tell him that, he'll most likely understand.|`|B3H7HIFGaa	He's with you. Not her. So let it go. Being too jealous can sometimes drive men away. So just realize he loves you. Obviously he feels bad if hes trying to apologize. so just laugh it off and say "hey, she may be pretty but didnt have the brains to hold on to him"|`|9vccbqrVaa	Don't ask him questions you don't want to know the answer to.|`|OlGple7haa	You should get over it!! Why would you initiate a conversation, ask him a question and then when he is HONEST with you...you get mad. That is letting him know that you can't handle the truth so he needs to lie to you to keep you happy. Now, does that make sense?? Just because he thinks she's hot, it doesn't mean he wants to be with her. you should trust that he is not with her because he remembers why he broke up with her and why is with you! <br>  In the future, don't bring her name up if you can't handle all aspects of dealing with the subject of the ex. Your insecurities could push him right back to her. So if I were you, I'd answer the phone the next time he calls and apologize for overreacting.|`|W20KslFzaa	You asked him a questing and he gave you an honest answer, why are you mad at him?  Would you prefer him to lie?<br>  Just because he's with you doesn't mean that he can't find other people attractive.  And just because he's no longer with her doesn't mean she got beaten with the ugly stick all of a sudden.  If she's attractive then she's attractive, that's it.  Guys can be shallow, we are.  We're very simple, so simple that we seem very complicated to girls.  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't be mad, because there are more important things to him than her being 'hott' otherwise he'd still be with her.  He's not with her, he's with you.  So if you trust him, like you say you do, then don't let this come between you.  If you don't accept his apology, and admit you overreacted as well, he may never be 100% honest with you again.  If he's open enough with you enough to admit that another girl is hot to you, then you have (or had something good) don't lose it by being petty.|`|ar7ynJB8aa	I don't think you should be overreacting over this. I understand that you're hurting that he said that but at least he's being honest with you and not pussyfooting around the situation. I think what matters now is that you're with him and he broke up with her so there shouldn't be anything to worry about. He broke up with her for cheating on him so there's likely no chance that he would cheat on you after telling you that and what has happened to him previously. Instead you should be happy that he's apologizing for what he said and that he was being upfront about it. No reason to be getting mad at something like that. <br>  <br>  Also, I mean in every relationship you have to be attracted to someone in some way or another. In all honesty you did ask him that question if you couldn't handle what he was going to tell you then why did you ask?<br>  <br>  There's no reason to be worrying about it unless he's changing and acting differently towards you and hiding things from you. <br>  <br>  You should definitely move on and accept his apology.

lNlL0Ag2aa	Wear something plain and casual but not too flashy. Don't overdo the clothing and just put something that you feel comfortable in because you don't want the guy to think that you spent so much time dressing up. Put something that shows your curves but covers them.<br>  <br>  Sorry to sound like a perv, but also make it a bit revealing. Don't reveal too much because it will make the guy more attracted to you because he will wonder what you're hiding. <br>  <br>  Now for suggestions, try to surprise him and catch him off gaurd and don't worry about him not liking it. Remember that every guy will love a girl kissing him as long as it was the girl that he liked and if he was the one who asked you out, then he does like you. <br>  <br>  So surprise him and plot one on him and make it last quite some time but not too long. Maybe like 5 seconds (remember this is a first kiss). A little foreplay could be nice, like try to cuddle next to him and then plant it on him because then you know that if he's letting you cling onto him, then he'll definitely want you to kiss him.

VwnLufUAaa	No matter what he says or does, do not have sex with anyone until you are 100% sure it's what YOU want. And do not have sex until you're ready to handle the possible consequences (like pregnancy, STD's, etc.) And never, ever have sex without protection.<br>  <br>  If you tell your boyfriend no and he still keeps pressuring you to have sex, it means he's more interested in sex than he is in you. Never date a guy who pressures you to have sex.<br>  <br>  Young guys are obsessed with sex and they will do just about anything to get it. They will have sex with anyone who'll let them. Don't give it up that easily. Wait until you are ready.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like you're ready, so just tell your boyfriend you're not ready to have sex. If he cares about you, he will accept this and he won't push it.|`|MTUHRMdZaa	If you don't want to don't do it! If he gets mad or anything then you don't need to be with him because he should understand you.<br>  If you are ready then that is a decision you are going to have to make yourself, but I would say by you having to ask this question then you aren't. So I would talk to him about everything and hopefully all goes good from there!|`|dYGLyVpzaa	Why are you confused?? If you are you obviously aren't quite ready! Theres no shame in saying no, if he likes you enough then he would be fine with this and wait for you. Don't feel pressured into doing anything you don't want to do - you make your own decisions! So stay true to yourself and make the right one here. Good luck :)|`|7zBnSIgRaa	I fail to see the confusion, are you virgin? if that`s it well think about it better, if not well, just get in bed why not?|`|ZPhF4imHaa	If you aint ready, don't do it!! Dont let him force you, and if he tries, then he ain't worth it.|`|2xlCj4utaa	give him what he wants|`|06Z3fh4laa	Yeah, really, guys wanting sex? What's the world coming to?!?!|`|Rb087BsAaa	yeah that's confusing.  a guy wants sex.  wow, earth shattering.|`|AA11011446	Clearly if you're not old enough to understand what sex is, then you're not old enough to be doing it in the first place!!!!|`|n7noPV7Aaa	If you are not ready then tell him. Do not do anything you are not ready for.|`|fox5a3ePaa	You dont say how old you are but if you dont feel ready dont be pushed into it|`|SRZza0cWaa	awww.. bless!! dont do anything..x

Did he say anything when he gave you this big hug? Maybe you should say something or just ask him.
