MOsStEbqaa	I think that they should have shot the owner for giving the chimp the pill. It wasn't the chimps fault that his body couldn't control something that is given to humans. He shouldn't have been shot.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	she attacked someone. If an animal attacks someone you have to put it down. What happens if it attacked another animal or another human.<br>  <br>  Also it could have attacked the cops.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think that he is a danger to humans and other chimps. he TORE HER HANDS AND FACE OFF. he needed to be put down. what if that woman was a baby? i guaruntee people would be all for him being put down.<br>  <br>  EDIT: exactly my point...if she were a baby he would have KILLED her. if she wouldnt have fought back he would have KILLED her.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	they kill dogs who attack people.<br>  why is this any different?<br>  he ALMOST KILLED HER.<br>  he has problems and hes NOT a pet.<br>  he wouldnt have been happy in a sanctuary. animals belong in the wild. end of story :)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	they had no choice he attacted a woman and riped her face off  and then he opend a cop car, got in and tried to attack the cop when he was shot. WILD ANIMALS ARE NOT PETS|`|wqRwSaGSaa	well it was either kill the chimp or let him rip her face offf.<br>  id save the human|`|voD8gnmcaa	i agree with you...but think about it...when dogs (house pets) attack someone they are put down...as terrible as that is...so when the chimp attacked the woman they would have killed it anyway...and he was still going crazy..i heard he went to attack an officer so thats basically their only option..they didnt have the chance to take him into sanctuary. he was going wild. but thats what happens...chimps are wild animals. he shouldnt have been a house pet at 200 pounds. but i feel so bad for him. i tear up wheneevr i hear this story. poor baby =[|`|4RTKq5t4aa	I think it was sad :(<br>  Chimps are not pets but the whole story is very sad and I feel very bad for the women that was attacked.:(|`|nBe13Qguaa	I was SO MAD when I heard his OWNER aka MOTHER stabbed him!
AA11296427	A what sorry? *Hannah is confused*<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|2lByIoqGaa	Hmm... I don't think so, but we never really talked about similes that much. :/ But I don't think so.|`|GK4G5Yt1aa	no, although the sentence has the word 'like' in it, its not comparing it to something else.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	No, I don't think so<br>  According to the dictionary, a simile is "a figure of speech comparing two unlike things that is often introduced by like or as"<br>  'Days' and 'today' aren't two unlike things<br>  It's still debatable I suppose...|`|uRjcTZK2aa	no, a simile compares two unlike things using the words "like" or "as"<br>  example: robert pattinson is as hot as a chile pepper.  :) just kidding, i swear, i'm not that creepy (but it was a real simile.)|`|bRmAUPmkaa	no it is not. something like 'as red as a rose' or 'a bird like a plane' is a simile
xIowgWL7aa	I remember feeling hungry, wanting to eat and then never getting past the first or second bite when I would feel full and sick. Then it would happen again a couple of hours later.<br>  <br>  Between that and feeling cold all the time, I used to wish that I could just throw up and get it over with.|`|BilLTGLFaa	You can be sick anytime during early in pregnancy, if you're blessed with "morning" sickness. I was sick before I ate, after I ate, if I didn't eat quick enough, if I ate too fast, while laying down, while working, etc etc etc! lol It's one of those things that comes along with pregnancy.|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	It's definitely true for me.  I always gag after I eat.  I tend to feel worse after I brush my teeth at night too.  You should really try to avoid greasy food and coffee.  Even though coffee is fine with my stomach before pregnancy, it's really upsetting my stomach now.  Good luck!|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Ohhh yeah, i know exactly how you feel. I couldn't eat a thing without throwing it up for about 6 weeks. I lost 8 kilos! But the doctor wasn't too worried, just make sure you take your vitamins and drink plenty of water.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	i had that feeling my entire pregnancy. sucked!

6Knhikr1aa	I started feeling them with all three around 10 weeks, but it usually takes a little longer. At first it felt like a little butterfly and as time went on, the movements became more discernable. Sometimes they just move for a moment, sometimes it's quite awhile. It's an amazing feeling. You'll see =-)|`|aXnVFFUkaa	like you have bubbles of wind inside|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I always thought it felt like a goldfish swimming around in my belly. I started feeling those around 15 weeks or so and I felt it occasionally, around 20 weeks I actually started feeling more "kicks" though.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	A bit like someone was blowing bubbles through a straw in my belly! For a first baby, usually around 18-20 weeks, but sooner than that for subsequent children. Not to often at first, and not for very long, but as you get used to them, you know what to feel for and you'll notice them more.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BilLTGLFaa	To me it felt like little bubbles for like 3 seconds. It was there then gone just as quick. Wasn't sure if it was baby, but now know it was! Now at 23 weeks I'm getting kicked all day long! It's awesome!|`|i9M0U9Meaa	sorta like gas bubbles i would say, and kicking kinda feels like a rapid heartbeat to me, but im only 18 weeks and the kicks are really tiny!|`|kmIcAySEaa	It feels like a butterfly in your tummy. The 1st time I felt the baby move (flutter) I wasnt sure what it was, but as it started happening more I realized what it was. I was almost 5 months along before I felt it move. When he first started moving it was very short and faint. Then it got harder and would last longer. Just wait until the end when the baby is full out kicking and punching you !|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	it felt like when your heart beats real hard and you can feel it in your chest, but instead of the chest, your belly 18-19 weeks but I wasn't sure what it was until I felt an actual kick at 20 weeks
cCXGEZxaaa	I love the name Lukas (more than Luke in fact) There are things to be poked at with all our names, at least with his you have to shorten it and know Russian. <br>  If your husband is really against it why not use Lukas as a middle name?|`|k4gXIxJNaa	Most lucas's eventually will go by luke some time in their life so yes it is to close. Also I wouldn't risk the humiliation for him later in life|`|1lm2VJ7haa	Well, your're not in Russia are you? Is the boy going to speak English & Russian? Luke is a great name & if you like it, that's all that matters!|`|H9o3jdm2aa	So cute! My daughter has a friend named that.<br>  I like it spelled Lucas nick name Luke but if you don't like it call it Lucas or the other way works to.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I love both names. :) That's a tough one. I think you should name your kid that and play dumb. It's a common American name, so the Russians will have to get used to it!|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	Well I love the name Lukas ( I prefer spelling Lucas but either way it is a nice name). However, a lot of people will want to shorten it to Luke so if it bothers you don't use it.
dR4QN0gHaa	Your mother is not a doctor so why is her opinion any more "right" than the doctors. I had toxemia and I went 2-3 weeks before I delivered after they diagnosed it. She should get a second opinion but to force the hospital to take the babies out is very irresponsible.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The only way to handle this situation is to get a second opinion.  Your mother is not a doctor.  Doctors can be wrong, or disagree with each other, but your mother's opinion does not trump the doctor's.  There are lives at stake here.  Find another doctor.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Your mom needs to find another physician ASAP.  I wouldn't have continued to see that one if he was never there.  That doesn't sound right at all unless she's seeing the midwives.  But if she has the symptoms like high blood pressure, protein in her urine she needs to be evaluated by someone who doesn't have their head up their behind.  She could always go to an ER that he doesn't cover complaining of a headache and get a work-up.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Has she had lab work done to prove she has toxemia?  You really are probably worried about pre-eclampsia...this happens before toxemia. If it is at the toxemia point your mother would probably be having seizures and out of it.  What is her blood pressure? Does she have protein in her urine?  Is her whole body swelled, not just her feet and lower legs?  If these tests have not been done then I would go to the local hospital and demand that these be done along with bloodwork.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	First comes mom's health interests always, after that is the fetus.  Her health is jeopardized by keeping her pregnant, and this is cause for a lawsuit and perhaps him loosing his license.   She could risk long term illness from organ failure, or even her death.   Yes he can refuse induction, but with a twin birth the routine is a c-section unless it's a perfect pregnancy and they are both in the vertex position.   She needs to go to another doctor ASAP and be delivered.
yFYFSjwcaa	I understand what your saying have you tried having a heart to heart with your wife and making it clear that getting up to take a child to school 45 minutes is ridiculous and that kindergarten wont affect a child's future plans in life.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I think you are being selfish.  You are her step father, you are a parent now.  Whether you agreed to it or not, that is where she is, if you had a problem with it the time to voice that has passed.  You are more than welcome and in fact encouraged to keep discussing it with your wife and prove that the local school is sufficient, but in the meantime man up and take the girl to school.  That's what being a parent is.|`|lzivF4Idaa	i think you're a little selfish. it should be daughter first, you married her knowing you were going to take over the fathering role <br>  <br>  if this is the only problem in your marriage you should be happy.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no, 45 minutes is a long way and her mother didnt ask or consult you before making these decisions.|`|zmpk29BLaa	No, I don't think that is selfish of you.<br>  <br>  I will say that I believe your wife should put your daughter first, but that doesn't mean that YOU have to drive her 45 minutes away to school. Your wife is her mother, its her responsibilty. Yes, you are filling the father role, but that doesn't mean that you have to do every order that your wife barks out.|`|gJldYuoMaa	no no its not appropriate, get help and make your wife understand what your going through, that is not acceptable if you want to stay together.its not up to me to comment and be the judge its up to you and only you can decideXXxxXXxx|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	just do it it will bring you closer to her you just have a lazy aditude about|`|G0QugnQ8aa	You call this little girl your DAUGHTER in the question but obviously don't feel the type of responsibility or love that it takes to put her before yourself...it may seem crazy, but in this day and age there is competition even in Pre-K situations, there are places that are deemed the best schools that have waiting lists and are nearly impossible to get into...don't you want YOUR Daughter to have the best start in life possible, even if it means you miss a little sleep...maybe have your wife take her to school to, rotate whoever gets the responsibility for what days of the week...and yes I do put my children first in my marriage then my husband and he is well aware of that fact and is fine with it, in fact he has told me that he does the same..we both do whenever it is really important..|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You're "not meeting her expectations"? Yikes. When does your husband contract expire? J/K It sounds like she has control issues, maybe. <br>  <br>  I think you need to find common ground about the school. If she has issues with the local school that's closer, well, maybe that's okay - we're debating on where to send our son next year because we're not sure the public school here is where we want to go. But yet the distance to another school is definitely an issue. <br>  <br>  but I think she needs to compromise with you. It shouldn't be your sole responsibility to get the kid to school - perhaps she could make an effort by waking up earlier too to see her off? Is there busing that you can consider? Some private schools will bus children from other areas to school, but it probably costs you something. <br>  <br>  Otherwise I would talk to her about possibly switching days so you don't have to be the one to get up early and do everything. That, and consider it a special bonding time together when you do bring her to school. Perhaps you can stop off for hot cocoa as a treat, or talk about things you see on the way, etc. My parents were divorced, and the time I spent with my dad on the way home to my mom's was special - we always went for hot chocolate and talked a little on the way home. So maybe you can turn an unpleasant moment with your wife into a good experience with your stepdaughter.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I think its time to move her to a closer school.
0xFQj585aa	Some couples are more likely to have one gender or another. Since you already have 5 girls, you and your partner are probably more likely to have more girls.<br>  If you can afford another baby go for it, but only if you would be happy with 5 girls as well!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I'm not quit sure what you are asking for.You run the "risk" of getting either gender...sooooo, would you accept it if you had another girl instead of a little boy?|`|5duq5DHnaa	apparently your chances of having a girl double after the age of thirty. But what do I know I am 27 with two boys and pregnant with the third!! Wanna trade?? Just kidding!|`|KvKY4FIOaa	If you are willing to raise another child, then go for it.<br>  <br>  And there ARE natural ways to help ensure the gender of your choice. Or at least help your chances a bit.|`|14S2PmqEaa	If you are prepared for another child go for it.  If it turns out to be a girl  you will still be happy.

471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Just wear a tight shirt and let them see. It's too late for them to say anything against it. If they don't want to be a part of their grandchild's life that's too bad. If your mum feels she's too young to be a grandma, discuss alternative names with her, like nana, that have a younger feel to them.|`|VJpdmd0waa	I'm 19, an im the same way you are. I'm living on my own, but im getting married this Oct an see my parents every week.

My parents kept saying the same thing, and so did my husband's. About how they were "too young" to be grandparents. They are in their 50's! That's not too young. So anyways, as soon as we told them we were expecting, their tune completely changed. I was nervous to tell everyone as well, but they are all so excited now, it's a very happy time. You might be surprised by the response you get, I hope so!|`|us9JQrTJaa	Just tell them straight up. It's your life, they don't own you.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	Just be straight forward with them. They really have no right to judge you. You're 21, married and you're living on your own supporting yourself. And 46 isn't that young to become a grandmother. My mom became a grandmother at the age of 38. My brother was 22 at the time, and while they weren't exactly thrilled because his gf was 18, they soon got over it, because they love my nephew more than anything. They are soon going to be grandparents to my little girl, in May. And I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant, I turned 19 in December 08. They weren't exactly thrilled, they were bother really upset with me at first, but they soon got over it and are both really excited about having a granddaughter in May. If my parents came around to me being 19 and having a baby, then I'm sure your family can come around to it too. Even if they don't during your pregnancy, trust me when they see that little one looking up at them for the first time, they'll fall in love.|`|qEPdwQIkaa	Dude! You are married...and an adult! I would just tell them. I mean you can't change that you are pregnant so you might as well just tell them and quit stressing over it. Stress can't be good for you or the baby. You have the right to be pregnant so embrace it! (Besides think of all the Mother/Daughter shopping bonding time you are missing out on!!!)<br>  Best of luck (With the coming out of the pregnancy closet and the last three months!) ;)|`|pGvigxdmaa	Tell them the truth... and if they don't like it then it your choice if you want to have the child. It is your life and you are 21 now and you are the ruler of your life. If you want this child then go for it! If they don't screw them.|`|kSL9oLZzaa	I dunno Y they dun wanna become grandparents young...I mean 46 is nt tht young either...tht's ur life and ur decision to have a baby and nt theirs. If u wanna have a baby then they shudnt try interfering bt shud be supportive. If they really love you they wont say anything bt understand the problem and will certainly love ur child!!<br>  try tellin them!!!!|`|PNqwhlq9aa	Send them an ultrasound pic. they will be happy eventually. You are married don't let them rule your life. Whatever you do, do it soon so they have time to get use to the reality.|`|7JbIxVqjaa	Be like MOm, I  need to talk to you seriously. Don't say anything about it, I dont feel comfortable talking about it.<br>  THen say Im pregnant, then say okay bye and leave or something<br>  Congrats|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	you have kids when you're ready to be a mother-not when your mom is ready to be a grandmother. she'll be fine with it when she meets her grandchild.|`|VHgfWPS2aa	Hunny just tell them your a big girl and your married honestly they will just be happy for you XX .. Congrats and the first answer was kinda a good 1 :p  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Send her a nice card that says grandma on it :)|`|FwCb6Ko5aa	Say, "I'm having a baby in 3 months."  Then walk away.|`|9PKq01sAaa	it's the best time of your life and you should enjoy this moment. you don't need to stress on what is the reaction of your family when you tell them.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Send them a card "from the baby" in the mail.  Make it sound so cutesy and include an ultrasound picture.  There's no way they could be mad.|`|OydLOXgJaa	I can TOTALLY relate to this... except I didn't wait until nearly that long to tell them, which could be a very awkward thing. I am 21 and married (I've been with my husband for 4 years) and actually, the day after I conceived (I was tracking ovulation, or that would sound very weird. Haha) my step mom and dad and entire family were asking when we were going to have kids, but said we needed to wait at LEAST another 5 years and blah blah blah. They were always SO pushy about that (especially my step mom!!!) and so when I found out I was pregnant a couple weeks later I was NOT looking forward to telling them... at all. I just knew they (she) would be so upset, and be negative and lecture me non-stop... I also see them about once a week though, and knew that it was bound to come out sooner or later, so I just told them flat out. "Guess what? You've got a grandbaby on the way in August" and grimiced while I waited for the ridicule to begin.... guess what? I got a shocked look and then shouts of cheer! Weird right? The only thing they seemed upset about was that they weren't the first to find out!!! (I was putting off telling them... cuz I just knew it would be a stressful disaster. Haha) My actual mom (who has been looking forward to us having kids soon) sounded a lot less excited than my step mom! Lol. I was thrown completely off guard. I think the only other person who may have acted this excited was my father inlaw, who was annoyed that we were going out in the first place, and then really not thrilled when he found out we were engaged, and grumpy the entire wedding. He's bubbly and excited about the grandbaby on the way. <br>  Anyways, sorry to have such a long story! I just wanted you to know that it's probably best to just tell them, and I bet you'll get a better reaction than anticipated. The only thing I honestly think you might have a problem with, is the fact that you are so far along w/out telling them   :)    It's easy for family to be opinionated about when you should or shouldn't have kids, but once they find out that THEIR grandchild is on the way? Pfft! It's like a whole new story.   :)<br>  Good luck to you though girl, and I really hope that they accept your baby right away. Even if they don't, you know there will be no denying that cudle little bundle of joy once they lay eyes on him/her for the first time!!! Especially since they are still very involved in your life, they obviously love you to pieces.   :)   Take good care. Good luck again!|`|emkg8X4kaa	This is long and drawn out but please read it, its important. <br>  <br>  Im 21, married and living on my own with my husband as well. My family has been apart of my life and we would go over to see them every weekend sometimes go over for dinner. I found out i was pregnant, we planned it, we both had stable jobs and a house and all and we can afford a baby. I told my parents. Honestly, my mother and father did not talk to me or was not in my life at all until i was 25 weeks pregnant. I called her consistantly begging her to be in the childs life even if she hates me. I didnt want my baby hating me for never trying to get his grandma and grandpa involved plus its good he has those figures in his life. All she did was slam the phone in my ear. i kept calling and giving her no strings attached plans to visit with her grandson. She wanted nothing to do with him. Finally I had had enough. I called her and i gave her one more chance. I said this is going to be her final answer. I said do you want to be in the babys life or not. She said..no. I said fine. Then do not expect to ever see him or talk to him or me ever again. Good Bye. I left it at that. I did not call or write or contact her in any way. Two weeks went by and I got a phone call from a restricted number. I always pick up my phone, no matter what in case its an emergency. It was my mom. She was crying and bawling and saying how sorry she was and it was all her fault (she never takes total blame, thats almost what kinda got me) I was silent and listened to her. She cried about how she was "too young to be a grandma" but she got over her issues and she wants to be in my life and my babies life. She apologized profusely and called herself stupid and stubborn. Finally, she invited my husband and I to dinner. My husband wanted nothing to do with my family after what had happened. I was under severe emotional strain from it all, and the pregnancy horomones werent helping. He saw me crying all the time and it pissed him off (the protector in him i guess). I eventually got him to go with me and im 39 weeks pregnant now and my mother and I have slowly and steadily rebuilt our relationship. She will even be there when i give birth. But there is a point to this story. I wasnt going to forgive my mother in the beginning. I was going to just tell her to get lost after all the pain she put me through, especially when a mom is a really great figure to have in your life at this time. But a thought hit me. My son is eventually going to get older, he wont stay a baby forever. We will have our fights, I will dislike some of his decisions and he will dislike mine. But In the end I want him to be able to realize we can disagree but I will always be there for him. I will always love him.But I cant show him that by being such a poor role model with my own mother. He will see that a disagreement split my mom and I up forever and he will think its ok to just never talk to me again because of our own disagreement. I dont want that. I am not my mother. I want to always be there for my son. I will make mistakes but i want him to eventually realize that I am human too even if i am his mother. So tell your parents directly. And remember they may do to you what my parents did to me. But in the end be the mature one. Always reach out and give them the oppertunity to change their minds. Once you let them know that, step back and let them deal with it however they want to. You never know, your mom may say today she is too old to become a grandma but tommrow she will be telling everyone she is going to be grandma with a grin from ear to ear just like my mom. Good luck.|`|xQthCMoJaa	first of all congratulations there is nothing to worry about, there are hundred of women who are gradmas even younger than your mummy i dont really see what the problem is, you are happily married and pregnant just tell them, at first they obviously wont be that happy but you'll see that in a couple of months they will be arguing btw them to take care of the new born
2pxiK9waaa	It's not what you read, but the connection you have with your child while you're reading. Reading anything teaches him to want to explore an alternate world and use his imagination. <br>  <br>  I teach reading/language arts to 6th graders in a low income district, and the main difference between my students now and my students last year was the reading culture that was set at home. Children who are not read to and who do not see their parents reading are less likely to want to read. Therefore, they begin to struggle with reading and eventually give up. That's how I have kids who, in 6th grade, are reading at 2nd and 3rd grade reading levels. No one is at home to encourage them to read or to read to them. <br>  <br>  Take him to the library and pick out a huge stack of books. He's learning to love words and learning that he can create a new "world" through reading. I'd also try some chapter books to read to him. Make it something special. <br>  <br>  With my niece and nephew (I started when they were about 4), I would buy a novel that I knew was great and we would read it each night and talk about the chapter we just finished. Some great titles are:<br>  Charlotte's Web<br>  Sign of the Beaver<br>  Harry Potter (this may not be the best "together" novel for a first try)<br>  Diary of a Wimpy Kid (it's great- it's a graphic novel, so it's comic book style)<br>  Junie B Jones--an entire series<br>  Magic Treehouse-- an entire series<br>  The Boxcar Children<br>  <br>  Mix it up--read a chapter or two one night, then switch over to Batman or superheroes. You'll also find superhero chapter books, too.|`|avx7bLnKaa	be happy foster this love of reading... then he'll be a reader himself when he gets older...<br>  reading to them may lead to him being a reader himself.... kids who read,,, can usually write better<br>  <br>  and picking up a book is better than turning onthe tv or a video game...<br>  <br>  you reading to him also helps develop his vocabulary and grammar and understand how to string sentences together|`|o65klEwWaa	At that age, reading the same book over and over is better than reading a different one each time. If you can stand it.<br>  Mix it up a bit by talking about the cover, title and the pictures. Ask him questions to increase his understanding and comprehension. <br>  <br>  Main thing is that he associates books with fun, that he learns a book starts on the left and reads through each page to the end, that the words on the page tell a story and reading aloud teaches him valuable listening skills.<br>  <br>  Other tips are leaving him hanging as you get to an exciting bit in a familiar book, so that he is prompted to finish it for you, teaching him to respect books and put it away carefully afterwards, helping you turn the pages. You should read to your children at least once every day, without any distractions such as TV in the background and not as a treat. Don't threaten to pull book reading that night if he is naughty. It is one of the most valuable gifts you can give to your child, as tedious as it is sometimes.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	Totally sympathize.  Been there, done that.  Keep in mind that he may be learning things that aren't obvious to you at the moment.  There are a lot of things kids need to learn prior to being able to read that help them learn to read.  Concept of Word (mentioned in a previous answer) is a big one---that the squiggles on the paper are words.  Later he'll be able to understand that some of these words that sound the same start with the same funny shapes, which will be a way to enter into reading.  Kids also need to know that people read from left to right and from top to bottom and what a title of a book is, etc., just from a practical point of view.<br>  As to the repetitiveness of the books, kids that age are creatures of comfort!  Despite the fact that it drives me crazy, my daughter loves hearing the same books over and over again too.  It's okay to change things up and introduce new books sometimes.  There are some real classics---don't try to introduce books that are too hard for him yet but you might consider the Nate the Great series or the Bailey School Kids books (although that might be a little hard yet).  Look into reading the Caldecott books for their beautiful illustrations.  Consider checking out books on tape so even if he wants to hear the same book hundreds of times you get a break.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Get more books but make sure some are also learnign/educational.  Like counting, shapes, etc.  Still read his batman, etc. but switch to a new one so he learns more.  Stimulation and development is key.  You may be tired of doing it but it pays off.<br>  <br>  I read to my daughter from infant and she knew a lot by 12 months.  She knew half the alphabet and words before 16 months.  She babbled words before she could actually say them.  She is very smart for her age...  She will be 5 in July and knows a lot more.  My son will be 2 in April and he doesnt really talk much.  I read to him but he gets up and walks away.  He doesnt sit and watch much educational shows, etc.  I've been told read and continue anyway because they do listen, just not sit there and see the book.|`|9vvWogZuaa	it helps by building imagination. He will have better english if he reads alot he won't be stresses and everytime he is mad, he can forget about things and go to a happy place|`|CvESLNnkaa	First of all it is a good thing.  This is why at 3-4 yrs of age children are learning the concept of words in written form.  That letters make words and words make sentences.  This is a concept he will learn by putting the story you tell with the pictures he sees.  As far as being tired of the same book all parents will have this problem mainly due to the fact that children this young like what is familiar.  Two things you can do to help this are: put the book a way in a hiding place and replace it with another book be warned he may cry when he knows the book is gone for a while.  The other thing you can do is to let him read it to you he will tell his version of the story that will differ from the original and gives some veity but also is good for his reading skills.  Hope this helps.|`|ThnKiLfTaa	Well the first benefit received is some cuddle time with your son while reading to him.... but your son is also developing a bigger vocabulary, but also expanding his communication and thinking skills. Reading to children help them learn to express themselves it broadens their imagination, creativity and their ability to re-enact things. It also helps your son develop a LOVE for reading himself. When we read to our children it opens the door to a big exciting world to them! It will give him a jumpstart on his education. He will be well prepared when he starts school. Enjoy this precious time you have with your son while he is still small enough to climb in your lap with a book for you to read to him! This time can never be replaced and I am sure will always be cherished!! God Bless!|`|hChhOhOGaa	It helps them acquire the information and skills they need in life, such as:<br>  <br>  Helps to develop the bond between the parent and the child. <br>  Provides a shared family frame of reference <br>  Helps a child to understand the purpose of the printed word. <br>  Builds a child's vocabulary beyond what he is able to read for himself, and provides the background for a new reader to recognize new words he is decoding because he knows what they mean. <br>  Helps a young child learn the connection between the written and printed word. <br>  Entices a child into an exciting world of learning and entertainment <br>  Helps a child absorb great amounts of information about the world and how it works, especially if parents lead children into discussing what is read. <br>  Develops listening skills. <br>  Gives the family an alternative to the media for entertainment. <br>  Helps the child develop a taste for literature.|`|RPd66ldYaa	My son is four and LOVES me reading tons and tons of books. Not the same book - but new ones. I think you could take him to the library - and although you might get tired of reading so many to him (I know what that is like) you will have a fun variety of books. I really like taking my sonm to the library and getting books...some of them were ones I read when I was little (Little critter and bernstein bears) so I enjoy it. You can also get books on cd (read along ones) for the little kids and that can give you a break from reading. At my library they also have LeapPad system's and books the kids can rent out..the library is awesome. I think reading is really good for the kids creativity and to learn about new things (if you're reading different books). Take care and good luck!|`|n2i9SnGPaa	At this age it is a bonding time as well as a learning time.<br>  Children learn lots through books from a very early age, turning pages, page numbers, letters, repetition, picture identification etc. If you are getting fed up - introduce new books talk about the author etc (this is introduced at preschool) and encourage him to act out and recreate the stories using his imagination and a little den. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps x|`|dbnGwNsXaa	I too just started reading to my son he is 14 months old. my advice to you is enjoy it, if he likes it no matter what kind of book u are reading to him enjoy the bonding time u have w him, even if it causes u headaches at least he learning. you might not think so bt really kids have a huge imagination just listening to the words make them smarter. Keep on reading to him it will pay off in the long run.|`|2BQAfFC2aa	Reading is reading. Its not what you read but that you are doing it. Hold him on your lap and point to the words as you say them. That will get him to understand better.
DuSFKygEaa	A baby's first hysterical laughing attack is one of the most incredible things that can happen to a parent.  Heaven must be like that.

TK0Ve2Swaa	I have two clomid babies.  Ist conceived cycle one, 2nd conceived cycle two of Clomid.  Days 2-6 50mg.  Talk to your doctor he/she may want to run test to check husbands sperm count etc but Clomid is usually a good first option.  Good Luck|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	diabetis shouldnt have anything to do with it but i know a lot of people who cannot get pregnant with clomid I know it depends on the person but i know no one for whom it worked|`|rdUKSiIxaa	You always can try... it depend from person to person.

PH9toZjwaa	ok hun..i understand you because i did take the pill and i was not sexually active at all.. all you need to do is sit down and talk to her about it. and tell her to listen before she yells.or  talk to ur doctor and have your doctor talk to her..i think it has helped my period. ..but u have to realize that pills are harmones and they eat away from your calcium..so read about all the side affects and everything and then make yo\ur decision wether or not to talk to your doctor or mom...|`|1ikl5q97aa	Do research on some pills to look at the side effects and see which one you best like note that price will probably be a problem right now due to the economy , i am 15 also and am trying to do the same thing and i have the same situation . But my mom knows i was sexually active just not anymore . Explain to her how bad your cramps hurt and that you would really like to get rid of the pain (i know it hurts i got the same problem hunnie:) . Do the research and talk to her about some of the choices and explain you are NOT planning on having sex you are just sick of being in pain especially in school .|`|4iJ1gI9Baa	Just be honest with your mom, you've got nothing to hide. You have adequate reasons to take the pill, and I hope she can understand that. Just bring it up when she's in a good mood and you two are alone. I think she'll be more understanding than you think :)|`|4geQ1ZoVaa	birth control pills have side affects. it deends on what kind u get. u sho ask ur detemetologists about what kind of skin u have. parents will freak but tell them u just want ur eriod n time or whatever reason u want it for. and u can't die!!!! unless ur allergc to some on the chemiclas insde|`|bTMdpMW9aa	No the pill shouldn't hurt you and just go on it.

You have to explain about the benefits of birth control. If she doesn't believe you, you should take her to your doctor and discuss it together. Being in pain and having bad acne isn't necessary, when your mum talks to the doctor, I think she might understand more. There are lots of different pills for you to go on, your doctor will help you choose the best one for you. If it isn't working for you (e.g you're angry or sad heaps and have mood swings) then go back and try another one. I had to try three different kinds because it effected my mood so much. If your mum can see that it is the best thing for you, then I'm sure she will want what is best for you. Good luck =)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Just don't mention the pill, but explain these problems and ask her if you can see a doctor about them. The doctor will probably suggest the pill and she might be happier if she sees it as a medical thing, not your own suggestion. Then again the doctor might suggest alternative treatments for acne and cramps, which could work just as well or better. So ask for a doctor's appointment. If she doesn't take you then that's extremely annoying, you will have to find a free clinic like Planned Parenthood.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Explain to your mother, about using it for your skin, not for BC.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	Midol's just a painkiller and doesn't even out hormone levels, so that wouldn't be a substitute. <br>  Given a choice between putting her daughter on accutane or the pill for skin, most mothers would choose the pill. You can bring it up that way, stating everything negative about accutane, and saying you may want to try the pill first.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Just tell her what you told us. I don't see why she wouldn't let you. If she says no, go to the dermatologist and ask for Accutane. If you're on Accutane and female, you have to be on the birth control pill. It's like a law. The HPV shot is very bad for you. It's under-researched and has caused many traumatic and deadly sides effects (you can die). Good luck!|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Tell your mom you have bad periods and it seems to be really bad all the time.  She will take you to the dr and you tell the dr what is going on.  They will ask how heavy it is and how long, etc. if it is bad they will put you on the pill to regulate it.  A lot of young girls go on it for that.  Plus, IF you decide down the road to become active, at least your already covered.  I did the same.  I went on the pill at 15 for my period.  I wasnt active until later and was already on the pill to make sure it was working.<br>  <br>  If the dr wants you to get the shot, do it.  You never know when you are active what will happen.  A guy can not tell you and your stuck with it for the rest of your life.  My sister actually was dating a guy for 10 years, she's in her 30's and she found out by her dr at her annual exam she got HPV!!!!  She was shocked and mad.  She has to live with that for the rest of her life and he failed to tell her he had it!!!!!<br>  <br>  Read about Accutane from webmd to get details.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you people are ridiculous! Saying she's too young for birth control? Seriously, this is why there are so many teen mothers and unwanted pregnancies. It's because everyone is preaching abstinence and are being so naive. You're not even answering her question.<br>  <br>  If I were your mom I would be happy to get you on birth control. I don't see it as free rein to have sex. I see it as you being responsible and protecting yourself so that when you are ready for sex, you are prepared. I'm not sure what you should say to your mom but good luck. Maybe check out a Planned Parenthood in your town. They offer family planning services (birth control) and I think you don't need insurance to use them.<br>  <br>  On the HPV shot I'm 22 and haven't gotten it. I don't think there's been a lot of research done on it and I did read that people have died. I would not get it if I were you.
vImloZKOaa	Lucky man. I can't wait to get a vasectomy, and I'm 21. I don't care what people say.|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well I hope that you got the kind that could be reversed if you wanted to, 23 is young to make a decision that impacts your entire life.|`|vd9mdriYaa	Your Choice|`|jNPCT96Xaa	I think that you would not have gone through with it if you didn't think it was a good decision. I think in one aspect it is a responsible move if you are lazy about being diligent with birth control. But unless you had a few samples frozen, you may regret your decision down the road if/when you decide you want to have children. It's one sure fire way to make sure you don't have to pay child support.<br>  <br>  Funny story: My uncle got one a bout 3 years ago. He started dating this woman about a year ago and he was suspecting her of being a gold digger and sleeping around on him. A few months in she tells my uncle she's pregnant and he's the father and she wanted to get married. He said no and broke it off. She had the baby and tried to say it was my uncles and file for child support. She was stunned to see the paperwork stating he had a vasectomy.<br>  <br>  I would not regret your decision. If the time comes that you want kids, you can always have a familial sperm donor or adopt. Its not as though you have no options available to you. Just make sure that any woman you are with knows that you will not father any children. For some women, this is a deal breaker.|`|ga2i6C5aaa	You're lucky to have been able to get it this young. My boyfriend is trying to get one, but doctors won't do it because he's ''only'' 23. I'm trying to have a tubal ligation but so far, they all say I'm too young. Very irritating... Good for you :) Where do you live by the way?? Maybe it's just here in Quebec that doctors are being a-holes...<br>  <br>  Thanks for answering back. I guess I'll just have to push the doctors a little more til they can't stand seeing me in their office anymore lol. By the way, not ALL women want kids, so don't listen to these stupid comments. I don't want kids and I'm a woman. And I'm guessing that I can't be alone in this world to be like that. ;)|`|zkHwRCm3aa	your dick...your choice.<br>  Also, I think answer number two is definately <br>  on to something.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	good i guess since you dont want any kids<br>  <br>  wrong section dummy|`|AA10414527	You will need to be up front w/ whomever you begin dating so, that months down the road when feelings have become involved, she will not be hurt/ shocked by this info.  <br>  Was there a medical reason as to why you did this at such a young age?

I don't know why..it just seems a bit drastic for a 23 year old single male with no kids to do. If you did it is your decision because it is your body. However, you might regret it someday. You are really young, and will probably change your mind about kids in the future, and what happens if you meet the woman of your dreams, and she wants kids?|`|E0SJx3Csaa	i think its going to be very hard to find a woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with someone she cant have a baby with because he made a really stupid decision.|`|DpeS2vA6aa	I was 24, single with no kids as well.

It could also be that your son is not ready for cereal but if the doctor suggested it then i couldn't see that being the problem. Good luck.|`|fHjSonssaa	I have been through the same thing- however my son has grown out of it (he actually started to grow out of it at about 4 months).<br>  <br>  My son was on meds (Rantidine)- and it helped, just a little.<br>  <br>  But the lifesaver- the AR Pillow.  I love it because it's safe and actually does what it says its going to so.<br>  <br>  Check out the wesite- www.arpillow.com<br>  <br>  My son could safetly sleep in bed with us when he was so small- and he like it.  He continued to sleep on it until recently, when he figured out how to unstrap himself all the way. He's a few days shy of 11 months.  He still likes it- he just doesn't like to be strapped into anymore because he's a boy on the go.  So we took it out of the crib.<br>  <br>  Anyway- it was a miracle for us and the severe reflux he had!!<br>   Good luck!!|`|whROrAhFaa	Is your baby "projectile" vomiting, meaning when he does "spit up" does it just kind of fall down the front of him or can he hit you 6 inches away?  This is one of the BIG signs of reflux.  My son was diagnosed with reflux at 2 months old, his ped first had me thicken his bottles with cereal, this sometimes will do the trick.  Not with us, luckily there is medication for infants reflux, as with any meds there are side effects and you may want to weigh the pros and cons before using this method.  Infants tend to outgrow this reflux when their digestive system matures some.  My son outgrew it by the time he was 1.  There isn't really a way to check if they've outgrown it though if the meds are working, basically you have to stop them to find out.  My son had severe side effects when he'd outgrown it.  He actually stopped breathing for a few seconds when I gave a dose because it was causing false contractions, thats how I found out it was gone.  Look up infants reflux online and you'll find that reflux is just basically his asophagus contracting, as your stomach does when you vomit. I'd also suggest researching ANY medications your ped wants your baby on.  Babies under 1 should only use long term medicines when it is absolutely neccesary, like I said weigh the pros and cons.  Good luck, I do hope things work out for the best =)<br>  -Mom of 3 in Baltimore|`|n6NthDxwaa	My daughter had this, and I tried the adding cereal to her milk too. Still persisted though, and the doctor's even did a barium on her to find out nothing was wrong internally. They usually outgrow it by 1yr. Solid foods are in the works, so just hang on. As long as there is more staying in than coming out, and no significant weight loss, your ok- still never hurts to mention it at the next visit. At 5 months, try some spoon feedings of stage 1 foods, and see if he still has the reflux.
lRq81lu7aa	To be induced the doctors give you medication for your cervix to open and dilate and medication to bring on your labor.  Which I don't think mother nature really wanted it that way, but in certain situations it has to be that way.<br>  <br>  I was induced for medical reasons.  I had Gestational Diabetes. I was induced at 39 weeks.  Most doctors, at least the ones I know, won't induce unless the baby is really overdue or their is danger to you or the baby or you have a medical condition that puts you at risk.<br>  <br>  Some doctors do induce at the mother's request.  I really wish I did not have to be induced because I did not sleep well.  I was induced at night and labored all night and gave birth the next afternoon.<br>  <br>  I did not sleep for almost 19 hours and it was draining.  You want all your energy to push that baby out, and I had very little.  It was tough.<br>  <br>  Since your mom is far away I could see wanting to be induced, but on the other hand, I personally would have liked to go into labor on my own.  Which I was in the early stages when I was induced.<br>  <br>  Its a choice you must speak to your doctor about.|`|fiUF4cAXaa	Out of 5 of my kids, I was induced on two of them. I can tell you that when you get induced, it hurts alot more than going into natural labor, so if that is what you decide, think about an epidural. Some doctors will induce at his patients request but some doctors will only do it if necessary. I would talk to the doctor now and have everything set up for your mom. I don't see anything wrong with it as long as it doesn't affect the baby in the wrong way. Good Luck to you|`|I07nxTAxaa	i was induced with my first child not something that i would not  recomend going threw. they wont let you eat and it took two days to put me into active labor. Most doctors will schedule you to be induced for 42 weeks unless there is something wrong with the preg. most docs wont do it for personal reasons cause it can put alot of stress on the baby. <br>  About the being induced part they tripple up the progestin i think thats what they call it. and it makes the contractions 10 times more painful. and they wont give you the epidurel till you are in active labor so you have to deal with it.<br>  I had second baby not being induced and it was 1000 or even 10,000 times easyer.|`|Yvy0V2ZJaa	I was induced with my daughter. My Doctor wouldn't induce until I had actually dilated to at least 1cm. I don't know if that's normal practice or just him. I'm pregnant again and at almost 36 weeks now. Since last time was so painful (2 days of active labor and an hour and a half of pushing) with an epidural that didn't work, I would never in a million years let them induce again. I wanted the epidural and I do this time too, however there is something like 20% or more of women who chose is and have the thing put in and it never works for them. So not only would you be having 75% more painful contractions, you have no relief. I wouldn't recommend being induced unless you Doctor gives you proof that it's medically unsafe for your baby. My first one I asked for it and got what I wanted, but they couldn't pay me to do it again.|`|NnWC1lxdaa	i have had 3 kids. my first two i went into labor by myself. my last baby they induced me early, they thought he was going to be a big baby and he wasn't as big as they thought. but if i have any more I WILL NOT be induced at all. the contrations are a lot harder. and plus i try to have no pain medication. if you plan on having an epi, then go for it be induced but if you want to go all natural don't have poticin. talk to your doctor maybe they will strip your membranes and that will set you into labor. your doctor will help you make the right choice. good luck|`|DLDweOcYaa	I had to be induced at 37 weeks because my waters broke.  It was a long labour (16 hours).  I was told that it's much better to go into labour on your own rather than be induced.  I ended up having an epidural and it was great!  The doctor will only induce you if they feel something is wrong and they need to get the baby out or if you are over due by 1 to 2 weeks.  A friend of mine is 12 days overdue and they are going to induce her in the next day or so.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have been induced twice but it was because of medical reasons and I dont know if your doctor will induce if it isn't anything wrong.  When I was induced I came in at 5:30 am and was put on the iv drugs, my doctor broke my water about 2 hours later, I started having contractions, and after about 8 hours of labor I had my baby.  If I had would of had a choice I would not have been induced because a baby needs to come when they are ready.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Don't get induced, a much higher percentage of women who are induced end up with a c-section as as the first lady said, it hurts a lot more.<br>  <br>  If you want to have the baby around a specific date, try natural remedies ahead of time and have your mother come in around your due date.<br>  <br>  If this is your first you will be in labor for some time, don't worry and just plan for her to arrive close to that date.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	A doctor will not induce before 40 weeks unless there is a problem or medical emergency i would ask your doctor at your next appointment about this so you can talk about it.  Good luck|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I'm also pregnant and due in June. The time is flying by waaaaay too fast! <br>  <br>  My doctor is willing to induce anywhere from 38 weeks on. If you explain your situation your doctor should be fine with it. The baby is fully developed as of 37 weeks so there really isn't much of a risk. <br>  <br>  Do you plan on trying to go natural? When you are induced your contractions will be much stronger and come much quicker then normal labor. It will be quit painful. I do suggest getting an epidural as soon as possible if you are comfortable with having one. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!

They say the consistency is like egg whites.  When it is not white and more milky that is when its just normal discharge.  It doesnt mean your pregnant.  You can also get a lot of discharge if you use scented soap in that area or perfume and it irritates it.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Maybe you have Bacterial Vaginosis, cause its not supposed to smell ever and when you have BV you get more discharge and it smells.  Its not an STD, just an imbalance, its easily fixed with antibiotics.  Go to a planned parenthood or a clinic and get checked out.  They will be able to tell you.  Yeast infections normally come with chunky white discharge I think.|`|8oKazGVGaa	i think you better go to the doctors because yeh thats sounds like a yeast infection oh and cranberry juice helps with that|`|AA11296427	Ew, ask your doctor please, it's not supposed to smell.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|XcX73990aa	no u do not, dont worry about it|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	god, i was eating!<br>  Please post this in the womens health section.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	If it's thick and white it's most likely a yeast infection. Depending on how thick or how much it smells, that's how bad the infection is. Remember, a yeast infection is just what happens when your levels are imbalanced there, there's too much of a certain naturally occurring bacteria down there.<br>  Edit: yeah you probably cleaned it too much or something, the vagina is self cleaning so doing too much can throw it off-balance.
dVAiuqZCaa	yes thats a symptom of pregnancy,it probably wont show up on a urine test until after your missed period.|`|rdUKSiIxaa	You can try day after your missed period but my 2 doctors said that jus ONE TEST FROM 18 will tell you that you are pregnant. You should do it ONE WEEK after your missed period!  <br>  The most accurate test is BLOOD TEST!!
2zC1lpfVaa	Before you waste money going to a specialist, how do you know you are infertile?  Are you sure you have been trying in the right way?  Do you know that you do not get pregnant by having unprotected sex at any time (as most of the people would tell you here)?<br>  <br>  You need to have a real plan if you want to get pregnant.  You can start by going to your library, or searching on the web.  Basically you can only get pregnant close to the days that you ovulate.  If you can afford it, you can get some ovulation predictor kits, so that you will know when to have sex.... <br>  <br>  Of course, if you find out that you never ovulate, then you will have to have a Doctor to prescribe you Clomid or other ovulatory.  For this, probably a general doctor can give you the prescription.|`|EDbnHmhdaa	IN the UK as long as you are of the right age and healthiness you can get it free.  I dont know about the US sorry . .

My husband and I were waiting for the doctor in the room. I decided to lay down on my back while we were waiting for the doctor (I knew that I was not suppose to lay on my back for a long period of time but I thought that it was ok for me to lay on my back for a couple of minutes). When the doctor came in and checked my baby's heartbeat, the heartbeat was slow. He told me to sit up and as soon as I sat up the heartbeat was normal and fast again. He reminded me that I should not lay on my back...for any period of time.<br>  posted 9/28/2007 by Adanna78<br>  <br>  Was this answer helpful?<br>  488 out of 529 found this answer helpful<br>  Thank you!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well i'm now 23 weeks and I was a back sleeper. Now i have gotten use to being on my left side that when I am lying down on any other part of my body I am not comfortable. It is said that being on your left side the blood flow is increased and is well distributed among you and the baby. So i would suggest to you expecting mothers, those in their early trimesters, practice sleeping on your side preferably the left so as to be comfortable when your belly grows. Use pillows as a source of comfort. I sleep with one pillow at my head and another below my breasts and under my abdomen. its comfy to me, hope it helps you guys.<br>  posted 4/08/2008 by Anonymous<br>  <br>  <br>  What's the best sleep position during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Expert Answers<br>  Jodi Mindell, pediatric sleep expert<br>  <br>  Although there's no real harm in sleeping on your right side, lying on your left side is actually good for you and your baby: It improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta and it helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate waste products and fluids from your body. That, in turn, reduces swelling in your ankles, feet, and hands. If you train yourself to sleep on your left side early on, you'll have an easier time falling asleep when your belly is bulging later.<br>  <br>  During the second half of pregnancy, avoid sleeping on your back, a position that puts the full weight of your uterus on your spine, back muscles, intestines, and the inferior vena cava (the vein that transports blood from your lower body to the heart). Back-sleeping can also put you at risk for backaches and hemorrhoids, inefficient digestion, and impaired breathing and circulation. Lying on your back in the second and third trimester can also cause changes in blood pressure. For some women, it can cause a drop in blood pressure that can make them feel dizzy; for others, it can cause an unwanted increase in blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Post your own answer<br>  Community Answers<br>  <br>  I also sleep on my side and sometimes feel an uncomfortable tugging sensation on my belly. When this happens, I use a thin pillow and place it under my belly. With a thin pillow, I can still feel like I am completely on my side, but my belly is supported. That way, it doesn't feel like there is that same pulling or pressure. This works wonders
rhPCJfeuaa	That's a lot of change for a little one to get used to right away.  Depending on the child, some adapt faster than others while others fight change every step of the way.  Even adults have trouble falling asleep in strange surroundings and/or hate having to go on business trips and be in new places.  She also has new teachers, correct?  That, by far, is what she is having trouble adjusting to right now.  the teachers she had were comfortable stand ins for you, but now she has to leave you and be with strangers who might not be as affectionate or might look completely different than what she's used to.  They might even have a couple of new activities that she may or may not like yet.  Definitely talk to her teachers and see if she settles down quickly after you leave.  If not, ask for some advice on what you can do with her at home to help her adjust.  Maybe go to her class and talk with her teacher with a big smile on your face and laugh so that she knows you like her teachers.  Don't worry...she'll adjust and be back to smiling soon enough.  Hang in there, hon!|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	Hm...well, if she's been going to this day care for about 10 months,  I doubt that its separation anxiety. Maybe it was the sudden room change? I know that when I went up a room, there was a kid in there who was just slightly older than me, and he used to torment me all the time. Made it so that I HATED going to daycare.<br>  <br>  Ask the staff of the daycare if there has been any change in her behavior, or if there is a new kid in her group, or whatnot, and when it started. Ask them to see if she is avoiding any group or children. Kids can be mean to each other, even at such a young age.<br>  <br>  If it turns out that once she calms down everything is fine as always, then maybe it could be separation anxiety. But I still doubt it.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Something may have happened there that made her uncomfortable or upset, the change in scenery could have also disrupted her. <br>  <br>  My son did perfect at daycare, he never cried or objected to me leaving him..  I had to switch day cares and he was a mess, he actually cried so hard it made me wonder (at this point he was 3).  I was at work and overheard a lady talking about how her child's arm got dislocated by a worker at the daycare center, i asked her where her daughter went and she said ABC daycare, which was where my son was at that very moment, i left work and went an got him, and never returned.    Kids know when something isn't right, does she have a new teacher?  But honestly if you havent had problems there before she probably is just adjusting to the new room and the changes, if she doesn't adjust in a few days i would look more into it though if i where you.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I agree with Emily May - Kids definitely have a way of telling you when something isn't quite right. It may not even be something that's happened to her; My best suggestion? Try to start dropping in unannounced and unexpectedly - Not necessarily to see her, but to observe what's going on, how they're talking to her and the other children in the new room - Sometimes it's just overstimulation because of some new surroundings and sometimes its more. Make some impromptu appearances - That way, if the caregivers were starting down a bad path, they'll correct in a hurry if they can't predict when or if you will be looking at them when they turn around.|`|AA11138222	Those differences are a big deal to young children. Every child is different as to when they go through separation anxiety. Getting used to new surroundings, sleeping on a mat, and new caregivers (I'm assuming as that is usually how it works when children move to a new room) is probably a little overwhelming. I suggest talking to the caregivers in the room she is in. Chances are she calms down after you leave.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	could be separation anxiety. I think Jacob, 8 months, is going through it now....and I am with him ALL DAY.

IlIjGTdiaa	Girl!<br>  Some names are unisex, however sometimes once a name becomes unisex, it then lends itself to be more of a girls name, as it then sounds like the boy has a girly name.

6169fa372faf693494242ead618d4045aa	Honestly, it depends on the stage.  The first month was hard because my 14 month old suddenly wanted to nurse every time he saw his sister nursing and because he was still such a baby and wanted to be held a lot.  After a month, it was surprisingly easy.  But at 18 months and 4 months, it got really hard again.  Now it's easy again but who knows how long that will last?|`|fiUF4cAXaa	My first three kids are 1 year apart each. Then I had two more that are 2 and a half years apart. I found having my kids close in age was harder than having them 2 years apart. It is hard to have a few kids in diapers and still on the bottle. You will be alot more busier that normal, that is for sure.|`|4iXL4C6paa	my children are 6, 3, 2, and 5 months..and I wouldn't have it any other way.

n6XYYyoLaa	baby gets whatever name mom puts down for her name; it can be your last name or her's...as long as you both agree, then there is no prob...gl, hth|`|SjX72fPyaa	No its your choice which of your last names go onto the birth certificate. Most people end up putting the fathers last name as the babies as well anyways but no, its not automatic. <br>  Actually since you two aren't married, after the baby is born the hospital will most likely give the baby your girlfriends last name until you fill out the form for your babies temporary health card.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	The mother can give the baby yours or hers, its pretty much her decision. Since you're getting married, it's easier to give her yours. My daughter has my fiance's last name. <br>  <br>  Technically, I think she can actually give the baby ANY last name in the book. There are women who give the child their boyfriend's last name knowing it's not even their biological child. Watch Maury lately? LOL. Anyways, my son's father was 300 miles away when our son was born and his last name is hyphenated with both of our last names. I do not suggest doing that...it's a pain in the butt and I'm trying to get it changed but that's a different story.<br>  <br>  Also...the tag on the crib at the hospital will probably have the mother's last name...example my last name is Ryan so my daughter's card said "Baby Ryan" even though her last name is different.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, that is not actually how it works.  You can both decide to have the baby have your last name, but if there was a dispute and you are not married, the mother decides.  It's not automatic.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	it gets ither her last name or yours whatever u guys decide|`|n6NthDxwaa	Yes, your daughter can have your last name even if you aren't married. At least in the state of Texas. I wasn't married, and named my daughter with her father's last name, he's on her birth certificate too. Also, my sister had a child that she put her boyfriend on as the child's father and gave her daughter his name even though he wasn't even the biological father|`|BRBiuYDOaa	no, only if the mother requests it. u will still be listed as the baby's father on the birth certificate tho. its a personal decision. if u two are actually gonna get married instead of planning to get married (they are completely two different things) then u both need to discuss if it is in the best interest of the child and if its beneficial to give ur last name to ur child. I say that due to insurance, legal circumstances and so forth.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Me and my boyfriend just had a daughter 8 weeks ago, and she has his last name because that's what I put down for her birth certificate. It all just depends on how you both decide to do it.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	She can take your last name, your gfs last name, or both the last names it's all about your preferance|`|smcWIZxPaa	you both choose the last name of the child, it is completely up to the parents.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	actually its all up to you guys what you want to do. If you want it to be her name thats fine if you want it to be your name thats fine whatever you all decide. I have even heard of people hifinating the name.

SJx9IWWtaa	I wouldn't say its ok.  But I can see it being understandable.   You feel what you feel, at least your realize it.   <br>  <br>  Maybe work on your relationship with his kids.  If you make it feel like they are family to you too, then you won't feel like you are in competition with them.  Most of all, don't get mad or take it out on them.  They are just kids.

SJx9IWWtaa	It depends on the situation.  When both biological parents are in the picture, most step-parents take the back seat.  I think this is because they are afraid of stepping on someones toes, and worried that their new step-children won't like them.   (Which is why I think a lot of them get stuck in the big-sister or big-brother role).   <br>  <br>  If one of the biological parents are not in the picture I think a step-parent has a better chance of being seen as a parent.  Just because they aren't in as much competition with the "real" parent, and don't have to worry so much about those dreaded words "Your not my real MOM/DAD"  But I guess this also depends on the age, it seems like the older the kids are, the less they see a step-parent as a parent.<br>  <br>  I live with my fiancee and his daughter, and have for a few years.  She calls me mom all the time, but I moved in when she was barely 3.|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	It really doesnt matter if you are a step-mom or a "mom" to kids.....I have a 9 year old step-daughter that calls me mommy even though i didnt give birth to her.|`|ICS49Ymtaa	I really hope it is. I am a step-parent and the hardest thing to do is remember that I am not my step-sons father. I have three kids of my own and there is a difference. I am the adult in his life that is married to his mother but I was not there for the first 16 years of his life. I have only been there for two. So what right do I have to expect him to call me dad or feel that way towards me. I can be his friend. I will always care for him as I do my own kids. I can always be there for him whenever he needs me. But in the end I will always be just the guy who married mom. <br>  <br>  His mother and I discussed what are the basic house rules and what are the rules of conduct toward the kids. We both agree that when one of us is gone, since we are the adults in the house and our responsibility, that we step in as needed when kids need a parents discipline. However if that is not needed at that time or can wait, we wait for the bio-parent to arrive. It is not a matter of having as much authority in the house. Both my wife and I work to provide this home for all the kids. We both have an equal amount of authority in the house. When I am not here my wife has all the authority that the kids bio-mom has. When I am home she differs to me with my kids as I do to her with her son. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong. I know not all situations are like that. I have been told that I have done a whole lot more for my step-son than his bio-dad ever has, and I do care for him and worry about him as much as I do my own kids. But I will never be his bio-dad and would never attempt to be anything more than a step-dad to him.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	my very close friends daughter lives with us and i consider her my step-daughter, she has no other older influence so i don't really have a choice but to act as though i was her bio-logical parent she's 16 so i wouldn't hit her anyway but i think it depends on the situation <br>  although in not her real mum i would still expect her to do as i ask her and treat me with the respect she would her real mum.<br>  <br>   but if the child has both bio-logical parents then i would say it wasn't for the step-parent to interrupt. <br>  <br>  but most of the time step-parents will sit back and leave it to the parents which i think is right.

AA10624857	I have been a licensed child care provider in my home in Michigan for 21 years. Currently I only offer part-time child care options and I charge $3 per hour. However, I am also licensed for 6 children at one time and can typically stay as full as I want to be, so my potential for income is actually $18 per hour. If you are only caring for 1 child plus you'll be transporting him in your car than I think you'll want to cover those expenses as well. Child care fees vary across the country and are dependent on several factors such as the economic climate in your area as well as the number of child care options available in your area. If this is to be a regular schedule than you may want to decide to charge by the day instead of by the hour. I think a 6 hour day complete with lunch and probably at least one snack as well as possibly breakfast plus taking him home would easily be worth $20-25/day. Since you will be transporting the child in your car as part of a paying job, you may want to consider speaking with your insurance agent to see if your state requires additional liability insurance. You will also want to have the parents sign a form giving you permission to transport the child in your car.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	When I did childcare from my home I called around to local daycare's and asked what they charged for that particular age group that I was going to be watching and charged like $15 less a week.<br>  Just make sure you have plenty of activities.|`|jaT35u4oaa	I would call around dayhomes in your area and ask. There are probably dayhome agencies that will help you out and tell you what the average rate is, since it's not full time, there is probably an average hourly/part time rate.<br>  <br>  Rates usually vary depending on what you plan on doing with the children. Parents will pay more for dayhomes that plan daily activities and fieldtrips as opposed to dayhomes who use the TV as a babysitter.|`|o2l9rUA0aa	I run a home daycare. 7am - 1pm is basicaly 2-3 meals. breakfast, snack, lunch. craft sometimes to take home. basic rule is 5.oo per hour to a man of 4 hours then charge a full day rate as the chil is then taking up a full day spot. 25-35 per day depends on your area. I'm in ontario canada not far from toronto.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	I pay $100 per child a week and it is from 6:20am to 11:45am.

Not so much anymore.<br>  <br>  I hardly talk to anyone, and I know kids say things about me at school, but it's not really a big deal anymore.  I don't really care if people don't like me - I prefer being alone, anyway.

812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	I'm on medicaid and all of my medical expenses are paid for by medicaid. Everything that occurs at the hospital is automatically covered, but there are only certain doctors and specialists I can see, but medicaid provides you with a list of all the people that accept medicaid. All of my pregnancy related appointments are covered, along with any dental work and eyeglasses. Even some psychiatric appointments are covered ( if you need them). It may be different in other states, but I live in Florida and that's how it is here.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	You don't pay for anything unless you get care somewhere that isn't covered. For example- I went to a clinic when I was approved for just medicare, and everything done at the hospital was covered. But then they had me choose an HMO, and I chose blue cross blue shield. unfortunately, the hospital wasn't a part of the hmo for bloodwork and lab work- so for the couple of times that i had things done at the hospital i had to pay for. then they sent me to another place for certain things and everything was good. so it can be confusing but as long as you make sure where ever you are you are covered you will basically be getting care completely free. <br>  <br>  oh yea, the person above me is definitely right- it does take a LONG time to get all the information straight and things situated. just keep on it though.|`|AA10381258	I'm in Ohio and on Medicaid. They pay for everything. Doctor visits, prescriptions (even for prenatal vitamins!), ultrasounds, the hospital stay, etc. I'll have coverage for myself for 2 months after the birth. I don't know where that person gets that it'll be attached to child support if you aren't married. Its completely untrue.|`|cUxdsuamaa	if you are married it will pay for every thing in your pregnancy. if your not they will make the father pay for the birth not you. they will attach it to the child support.|`|DksDTsuQaa	having medicaid is the best thing to have while being pregnant because  you will need it for doctors appointments and medication especially when its time  for labor it pays all your bills so if you are pregnant your best bet is to get on medicaid so you will not have to pay anything at all and wont have bill collectors calling you or sending you collection notices.|`|U8j8q0Bzaa	indiana they payed everything medical dental vision it was nice to have got a look at my kids bill from the nicu twins stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks 1 $28,000  2  30,000 i payed nothing for that or myself best thing i the world|`|SbMNG8RMaa	I am pregnant and on medicaid right now.

I was 3 months pregnant when I went in for it.  I'm in Washington state.  I'm Due in 5 days and they even cover birth control after I have the baby and my 6 week check up after the birth.

4geQ1ZoVaa	when they accidentally get pregnant<br>  when they smoke<br>  when u hurt someone|`|2GrlzDOxaa	when we get four fricken f's in the SAME class!<br>  then we go all "but mum! Im bored. and im a teen learning the ropes..." or when we say fu*k or Sh!t  and get caught. Thats an automatic um did i just say that out oud or we all say that! not just me!|`|D6asmqFVaa	when we don't want to do something.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Dad: Well I lost my job and now I have to work at 7-11.

eHow24rNaa	My fiance and I were having unprotected sex and him not pulling out for like 3 yrs and i never got pregnant and then one day, i did. I had irregular periods also and was on the patch. And also had abnormal cells...it sounds like you are just like me..lol!!!! It just took me a little longer to be pregnant. When yall are ready to have a child, get the ovulation kit they have at any drug store and take those to see when ur fertile since your periods arent regular. Plus, i wouldnt wait too long to have babies since your mom couldnt have anymore. Wait til your married or whatever but dont wait til your like 30....lol|`|8cLLhDrfaa	ur normal.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Well you are still on birth control, no matter if you missed them or not. Every time you have been 'unsafe' it may have not during your ovulation.   I was on the pill for 3 years. I was crap with it!! I missed them here and there, ending up taking 3 some days etc...i was crap.  During that space i never got pregnant and my b.f never pulls out.  Then one day while i was still on the pill i got pregnant. I think it just happens when its meant to be.   If you came off the pill and monitored your cycle for a few months and worked out your exact ovulation date then it would be easier to try. If you need help on how to do this email me.   If you don't conceive this way after 6 months its best to find out why but there is nothing indicating you cant have kids.    My mother also got told she couldn't have more children after me. They was wrong and she went on to having 3 more :)  All the best x|`|nZBtm3meaa	Your best bet is to talk to your OB about your concerns and be very open and honest with them about how you take your pills, how often you miss them.  It could just be that you've been lucky and the times that you missed a pill it wasn't the right time of the month.  Even people with healthy reproductive organs don't get pregnant every month or every time.  If you start talking to your OB now, you'll be able to be more prepared.  Good luck!
0QYIbn1saa	Oh, the beach.....that sounds grrrrrreat!    We decided we are going to put the $1K child tax credit in his college fund for the next 17 years....    After that, we are using the money for house things (boring things like a new washer, new garage doors, blah).  Oh, and we are going to buy him a wagon - that will be wheeee fun!|`|czY7K8yKaa	yep, the oldest boy needs a new dresser his drawers are falling apart.  My youngest daughter needs  new bedding for her bed, and they each need new bikes.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	I'm guilty of buying Bradley something every weekend, so the refund wouldn't really be any different.

LMAO at your superfan :)|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	I have to pay. But if I were to get a refund i would buy a pool for this summer and a new trampoline as my dog (a 5 yr old lab) ate ours.. seriously we came home from a day out and all that was left was the springs and shredded  pieces of the trampoline. was the damnedest thing I've ever seen.|`|GZdvHbT5aa	I'm going to buy Sam a new comforter set for his big boy bed and some new decorations for his bedroom. I'm turning it from a nursery into a big boy's room. I'm trying to find Kung Fu Panda stuff (his new all time favorite movie) but I'm having trouble with it. I think the movie may not have been popular enough.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Our original plans have changed drastically. I'm scheduled to see a surgeon tomorrow to have my gallbladder out, so there's another huge chunk gone after all my tests, ultrasounds, x-rays, the surgery itself, and lost pay for my husband.    Right now where it stands most of it is going toward my medical bills.  We're taking the kids down to Gatlinburg, gonna hit the zoo, and Ripleys Aquarium, catch dinner and come home. Thats about it.     We have to wait a bit for it to warm up though, 3 inches of snow on the ground now lol. I figure mid March we'll shoot to make that lil trip (80 mile round trip).|`|AA11537580	normally we spend it on whatever.  last year we did our daughters whole room(new bed and paint and so on) so we spent all most all of it on her.  this year we will be paying off bills because my husband got layed off 2 weeks ago.  She might get a new top or something.|`|WirFwirLaa	You could say that...I'm using a bulk of it to pay off the hopsital bills from having my son. Insurance covered a huge chunk of it but we still owe about $600 bucks. The rest i'll tuck away for summer vacation.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I am blowing all of mine on taking my 16, 8 and 6 month old to the Virgin Islands.

The rest will go to bills and a nice dinner for me and my bf.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	We already got our tax return back and yes my son had his pictures taken, a bunch of new clothes, and some new bottles and pacifiers. Then of course we paid bills.|`|HUQQzph2aa	Saving it for a new car, a fence, home improvements and that is about it! Well, I would like to go away for a weekend, but we'll see ;)|`|uqZsiMsdaa	I have a daughter who is 2 and another on the way in a month. I do plan to "spend" some money on then. I'm shoving it in their savings accounts so when they are older they will have money for college etc.     Aside from that the majority of it is going into mine and my husbands savings account other than a few small items that we purchased for the house mostly due to the new baby coming.    So, if you consider preparing them financially for their future spending money on them, yes. If shoving the money in a savings account rather than spoiling my kids even more is not spending money on them then, no.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I will have to see what's left over after paying bills, getting brake pads, etc.  Pretty much all of my money goes to my kids though, lol.      I would be paying in if it wasn't for the $10,000 I spent on child care!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	all these questions about tax refunds are depressing me.  some of us actually pay in at tax time!    but have fun spending your money!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We'll use the majority of it to pay bills.      But, we've already bought a $400 laptop that everyone is using.  And, will buy another for the teen who's off to college in the fall.  I'm sure we'll go to a movie or out to dinner.  Maybe a weekend at a waterpark hotel.      Anything we spend will end up either bumping up the credit card debt or, not helping with it, anyway.  It's kind of moot whether we spend it directly or use it to pay the bills...|`|EtCRnDJMaa	ours goes in the bank|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Nope. Not unless there is something he absolutely NEEDS.

But we owe money this year.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Little bit of both.  we are taking the kids to Disney World.

He's like obsessed.     Yes I do plan on getting my children some new stuff. They just had their birthdays and Christmas so they don't *need* anything but as soon as the weather gets nice i want to take them to the zoo and the amusement park. I also need to get them a new dresser (they share one now). I want to get Tyler a camera as he has recently become obsessed with taking pictures (see my Q). For Riley...I'm not sure yet...maybe walking independently lessons? LoL. I also want to put some money away in their college funds.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Well, we HAVE to buy gravel for our driveway. We live about 1000 feet from the road and at this point it's either buy gravel or trade in my neon for a 4 wheel drive.    And we're going to fix my Camaro. It's been sitting for a year with a cracked head.     But seriously, yes we'll spend money on the kiddo too. But he'll probably get mostly clothes and shoes. The kid has EVERYTHING - the tricycle, the bike, the wagon, the swing set (complete with tree house and sand box - thanks to grandpa), and a house full of toys. Although I'm sure we can find another "fun" thing that he'd LOVE.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We've used some to pay off credit cards, get my car's windshield fixed, pay off the taxes on our new vehicle, put some in savings, and we did buy the majority of Noah's birthday presents with some of it(that was the funnest part!).|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	You'll end up with more in the long run, if you claim/pay in the right amount, so you dont get a refund.|`|AA10811784	Some of it will be used to pay off bills, some of it will be used to buy some things for the baby and the rest we will save for occasions like you say... aquariums, museums, the zoo for spring and summer.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Nope, nothing but booze, ciggs, and escorts for mommy :)    I'm kidding! I do my W-2 so I get more throughout the year and just a little during tax season, so it isn't much, around $1,000    I'm actually saving it all to be used throughout the summer. Her birthday is in June and we want to go to San Diego (2 hours away) for Sea World and the big Zoo. Plus her big brother comes out to CA for the summer only and his birthday is in July, so I want to have some extra money to go do stuff with him while he's here too. I'll renew my membership at the aquarium, dinners out together, souvenirs at the parks we go to, stuff like that.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	You need money to go to the beach? Wow i'm lucky cause its free here loll.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	ours will be for bills and maybe our summer vacation to south carolina. maybe a little bit to start Jacob a savings account. it all depends on what we get.    Eli's mommy... GREAT IDEA!!! I think I will propose to the hubby that we do the same. that money should be for Jacob afterall.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Maybe you could take your troll to the aquarium with you guys?!  I am going to buy some outside toys for the backyard. We are moving into a new house so I think he'd like a little play gym or something.  I don't know what else, I'm not sure how much we'll get back either.  Oh since he rides in the car I'm sure he'll appreciate the car getting paid off,LOL|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I think we are going to save ours.  I know how practical.

Im only taking some out for basics like food shopping, etc etc...yeah Im boring LOL but my daughter needs to eat too =)|`|prqrQcd1aa	I have to buy a new washer and dryer as my old ones have both went bad and it would cost the same amount to fix the ancient things as to get new ones...

If anything is left then yes, i will probably get each of my children something small. I have 3 daughters!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	We're probably going to spend about $1500 on the boys and use the rest to fix up our home (which will also benefit the boys) We are going to redo their room and fix a few things.    We are going to Holiday World at the end of May, but we'll be using part of my husbands paycheck for that...|`|C4miEeuYaa	In a way, yes...My fiance Matt and I are going to put our returns into savings so we can put it down on a house in August. We were living in Matt's dad's house along with his dad's girlfriend and her son. We have two children a (9 yrs and 6 mos). It was only a 3 bedroom house-so it was pretty darn crowded. The baby slept in our room. We just moved into an apartment over the wekend and want to get a house of our own in late summer so the girls can have their own rooms and a backyard to play in! Next year and the year after-I plan to put our returns into savings to save up for a trip to Disney World for them (and maybe us just a little lol) Have fun at the beach! :)|`|s1zitZMOaa	I don't even know if we'll get a refund or not - we might.     If we do, we'll probably do the same thing we do with all extra checks (refunds, bonuses, ect.) - it'll go into the college fund. So yes, ultimately it's getting spent on the kid. Just not today.|`|kRui5wGtaa	A LOT of our money is already accounted for...but whatever is left we are going to put into HIS account.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	We are putting our money into rennovating the kitchen.  Our floors are yucky and bubs will be crawling soon and I want a nice floor that I can mop and clean often.  I also want cupboards that can be baby-proofed.  Our current cupboards are 50 years old and don't close all the way sometimes.  Ultimately a new kitchen will improve the quality of life for everyone in the house, baby included.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Turns out I DO get all of mine back!!    After I pay insurance for my car for the year ($600) I'm most likely going to open a savings account for Jamie and put half the rest ($350) in it.    After that, I'm getting a new pair of jeans and shoes (red high heels, but gotta slim down first!!) and putting the rest aside for "uh-oh's" (I hate the word emergency...)|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	We're taking a trip to the beach in April.  The rest I'm not sure what we'll do, probably just sit in our checking to be used with the rest of our money...|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	We are using ours to buy a new mattress for the bed, new living room furniture (we don't need it, but I'm ready for a change), if we have enough left I want to redo our den and we are taking Landon to the Audubon Zoo when the weather warms up.|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I'm going to pay off my debt, so that I don't have to spend money every month on bills. If I happen to have anything left over (which I probably won't) I'll put it into savings. I would most likely spend the extra cash on my son. I went to shopping for me all of the time, to shopping for him! :)|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Yes, he wont be getting any toys, but new summer clothes will be on the list!
gx4s68s8aa	I don't think that a strawberry cereal bar can give you hives.  I have a strawberry allergy and I have always been told by doctors that it is only fresh strawberries that cause problems.  The chemical in fresh strawberries that causes the hives is destroyed when the strawberries are frozen or cooked.  I eat strawberry preserves, cereal bars etc all the time and don't have a problem.  But I haven't had a fresh strawberry in over 15 years, since my strawberry reaction was so bad the last time.  My eyes were swollen shut, and I had hives from the top of my head to my feet.    So you might want to call your child's doctor.  Ask about it.  I guess it is possible, but I don't think it is likely that the cereal bar caused the problem.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I'm 23 and still have a slight allergy to strawberries. I get the same rosy cheeks and my eczema gets worse as well. I still snack on them occasionally, they're so yummy! But I would keep your little one away from them for now. And make sure you keep a close eye on her. She could have a worst reaction next time.|`|qStmw7qgaa	This happened to me when I was a baby, but I was breast feeding and my mom had eaten just 1 strawberry.  I broke out in that same rash.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	I've read about berry allergies. Is this her first time with strawberries? I would go over everything else in her diet but its definitely a possibility.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	Maybe alergies. its not intended to give babies strawberries till 2|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	She may be allergic to strawberries, or she could be reacting to one of the other dozens of ingredients; like the soy, elderberry, corn, etc.    You can try a skin test with a real strawberry if you want.  Or wait a month and try real strawberries again.

la1KlgJ3aa	My son got this camera for xmas. (Blue of course) Im not sure if his is waterproof though?/ looks like the exact same camera. It is very durable. It takes not bad pictures for a toy too. COmes with a cord that you can download the photos to the tv to see. Battery life I think is fine.. Havent changed the batteries yet that I know of unless my husband has?? I think its pretty cool!

8EW3JDmbaa	Best thing to do would be have a blood test at the doctors, it will put your mind at rest. I have read some women do not get positives on tests at home until 6/7/8 weeks pregnant!    You may also have done the test wrong or with dilute urine. Best to take another with your first urine of the da and see what it says!    Ive been there with the insanity!|`|mRQxlNH5aa	It's possible, try another test...different type. Say you tried EPT, now try First Response or something.|`|zSABr7praa	Pregnancy tests can give false negatives, rarely false positives.    Good luck!|`|AA12300309	Try another hpt. If it's negative and you still haven't had your period, call your dr to schedule a blood test.|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	It would be highly unlikely, because your hcg hormone levels would be high enough even at their lowest at this point, for any test to pick up the hormone, even the most insensitive ones out there would be able to pick it up unless there's something wrong with another part of your body, such as your kidneys, where the hormone doesn't make it into your urine and/or bloodstream. Otherwise you are probably not pregnant.    If you're still in doubt, you can ask the doctor for an ultrasound, which would tell you for sure if you are or not pregnant. My honest opinion is that you are not. Good luck.
aJLx0nhNaa	I think "that mother is feeding her baby."  I guess I don't really think about it much at all.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If I notice (and I usually don't, because most moms are discreet, and I'm usually minding my own business) I think "Great!  She's breastfeeding her baby AND she's not afraid to do it where-ever she happens to be."     I breastfed in public often when my daughter was a baby.  I never got any negative reactions -- very few reactions at all. (Again, I was discreet, and people were minding THEIR own business.)|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't feel anything towards it.    She's feeding her baby, just as I do mine when I'm out and he's hungry. I don't think she should be looked down upon simply because she's breast feeding. Most breast feeding mommas cover themselves up and respect others while out anyway.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I would think - good for her, her baby must be hungry, i remember doing that, any or all of those things.  I did it and it didn't bother me.   no one ever said a word to me about it.  not once.|`|Grmsgziaaa	I think the people who dont agree with it are sick.    A mother feeding her baby is a good thing. Boobs are made for eating, not sexual usage.|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	I think breastfeeding is the most natural thing for a mother to do with her baby.. speaking from personal experience, I was onced asked by a lady at a resturant to leave b/c I was breastfeeding and she didn't think it was proper, when I said no she went to the manager and the manager told her he has no rights to ask me to leave.  so she left, I don't see how people can act so childish... after all that is why god made breast but now they are seen more of a sexual icon then what they are made for...|`|NeI9MOhKaa	its completely norman in my eyes as long as she isn't exposing her self completely.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I have only ever seen a woman nursing outside of my mommy group once, and that was in a restaurant.  Her baby was probably about 8 months old, and I thought it was great that she was nursing.  Now, I am not certain I would notice at all really - the mommy group I go to has about 20 breastfeeding women, and it just became very common place to see a fussy baby who was immediately nursed.  And because it' a mommy group, people aren't really discreet about it - they do just whip it out and feed their baby.  Honestly, when my baby is fussing and I know she is hungry, I don't think of nursing her any differently than I would pulling out a bottle.      Anyway, I do try to be discreet, but I don't cover up because I can be more discreet that way.  My first time nursing outside of my house, I was in a car in a parking lot parked well away from other cars and someone pulled up and parked next to me - it was a woman with a little girl who was about 5.  The woman looked into my car and got this horrified look on her face and ushered her child away (eyes covered) as quickly as she could.  The kid couldn't see over the door.  I have also had people commend me for breastfeeding though.  It's not very common in my area.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Nothing wrong with it    Harriet|`|GqsLNUE8aa	Ohhh the opportunity to VENT WHOOP WHOOP Thank you sir.    Here's my story:    I was at the grocery store with my then 2 month old daughter. Walking slowly through the isles and nursing her. I was wearing my winter coat and a nursing shirt that covered my belly so when I say you couldn't see $$$$ you really couldn't see anything but my babes feet.    So I'm walking and I feel this presence behind me, then beside me, I look and this dirty man is looking at me with a smirk, I look down (consciously checking to see if anything is exposed, nothing is), then back up and he is still GAWKING at me. So I say (confrontationally) "Do you mind?!?!" He chuckled and turned away. GRRRR SO THEN his wife who was behind him and I pipes up (I guess she didn't like her man gawking as if it was my fault) she says "you know what, there's places for that" I was pissed now. I said "Oh ya?!" , "YA!" she says, "It's called a bathroom".    HAHA so I said "Ya, you two look like the types that would eat your lunch in the bathroom" That got an elderly lady in the isle laughing and the cashiers attention. These people just stood there like cavemen without a clue. The cashier said " She can breastfeed wherever she wants" with that they started walking away. I couldn't help but add just as they were leaving my site "It's to bad your mama's didn't love you enough to teach you what boobs are for!" "Ignorant  $%$@ ! "     While mine isn't everyone's style I truly believe that breastfeeding publically and proudly (yes tastefully) is the only way our society is ever going to change. Standing up for one's self and child is part of that.     I havn't had all bad experiences. With my son whom I breasfed for 19 months and often in public I never recieved any bad comments (the wierd thing is that back then I was a teenage mom ~ you'd think I would have had to deal with it more so then. But lucky it came years later, when I had quite a bit of education under my belt and a whole bucket of confidence.     Another story I must share: On the bus not to long ago with my daughter I was nursing and a little girl asked her mom what I was doing she said "feeding her baby" which is a great answer but both the mom and I could see the little girl was confused. After asking permission, I teached the little girl Ava what boobs are for, once she was comfy the questions came by the dozens and very quickly she asked to see, I again asked for permission from the mom and showed little 4 year old Ava how a baby should eat. The more kids that see it, the more normal and less taboo it will become.    My opinion. Thanks again for the opportunity to vent.|`|bAp35x7uaa	I know, it's a sad world we live in when a child can't be fed by its mother without people becoming offended.     I'm pregnant myself with every intention of breastfeeding my child - woe betide anyone who tries to tell me I can't, or that it is indecent. It's only their mucky minds that makes it something other than a child being fed.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I have been lucky enough not to be harassed in public.  I had some lovely experiences in CA, where I am from, since it's quite common to see moms NIP, and I was actually congratulated for doing so.  :)  It was awful that the only person to give me grief was a friend, yes a FRIEND!   Grrr needless to say I no longer speak to her!  She actually finds breastfeeding disgusting.  I pity her child.  I refuse to use a blanket or cover, since my daughter hated them from day one.  I also don't find it necessary; breastfeeding is not dirty or shameful.  If someone happens to catch a glimpse of nipple, they are looking too closely LOL!   Plus I've never seen any nursing mom dancing on a table with her top off, yelling "come watch me breastfeed; I need attention!"  Come on!  We are just trying to nourish and comfort our children.    I find it quite pathetic that our culture refuses to acknowledge the primary reason we HAVE breasts!  Go ahead and use big fake boobs to sell beer, but the moment a mother nurses...."YUCK!  GO AWAY!  COVER THAT UP, NO ONE NEEDS TO SEE IT!!!"   *eye roll*|`|dSJduHvSaa	Oh yeah|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	I think it's great!! I saw a women nursing at the mall, and looked away not out of  disgust, but to give them privacy. I wish I could of breast-fed my son longer then I did.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Nursing in public is normal we have to feed our children if that is the only source of food he or she gets. I have done it and will do it again if my baby need to eat. I think some people need to just grow up.    If they stop think of sexual advances when they see it they will come to understand that it's what a mother MUST do to have a healthy and happy baby!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I think that is a private thing between mother and child. It is natural and not sexual in any way but that doesn't make it appropriate to do  blatantly in middle of a crowded place. There is always somewhere off to the side to have that moment. And i will surely breastfeed my child and think it is the most beautiful thing ever, but that doesn't mean i should make it a public affair.|`|yPNvecc7aa	As someone who plans to breastfeed, I think you should be allowed to breastfeed anywhere.  I still don't understand if it's the act of breastfeeding that is offensive, or if women are actually exposing their breasts in doing it.    I plan to feed my baby when he wants it. But I don't plan on exposing my boobs to the world. Everyone I know who breastfeeds uses a receiving blanket. I assumed all women would be doing this, but from the sound of it, some women are just whipping it out. I guess more power to you if you feel comfortable doing that. But I wouldn't do it.|`|CpdJqRXQaa	People who see this as sexual are sick!  there's a baby hanging off it!|`|mgLb5Yohaa	I so rarely see it these days...    Before I had a baby, I admit I didn't fully appreciate seeing a woman reveal herself in such a way, I just couldn't wrap my mind around the idea she was "feeding the baby." I was ignorant.    Now, after being a breastfeeding mother, I truly admire those women who have no shame in doing in public in such a way. I pumped and fed via a bottle, I just couldn't embrace nursing fromt the breast in public.     My own female family members don't encourage breastfeeding, let alone nursing in public. It's a rough road to breastfeed when the support isn't there...and it's the most natural human thing to do!|`|1c32b2a7f08aa2dc2fd8c1ccbe87d1c6aa	When a baby needs to eat, a baby needs to eat.  Whether it's at home or out in public.  The baby doesn't care - he/she is just hungry!  I breastfed out in public - it was very nerve wrecking.  Kudos to breastfeeding moms period and also to those who nurse in public.  I think as long as they make an effort to cover up some what, then they just need to be left alone and feed their babies.  They're not doing anything wrong but giving their babies the best start possible!!|`|ILeHr73Baa	i dont think its bad at all.   i would like to see also without offending|`|KDb96QS7aa	Well, I for one am one of those moms who will breastfeed anytime anywhere.  I of course try to be discreet. I find though, that the best way to be conspicuous is by wearing one of those huge shawls or "hooter hiders" that come in bright colors and announce to the world "I'm breastfeeding over here!"  The best way I've found is to position yourself away from the crowd, quickly latch on the babe, then put a little blankie over the face/boob.  Maybe it means someone sees a flash of nipple. Oh well. There have been two times I was looked at "funny." Both times, it was by men my age who I caught eyeing me before I started breastfeeding. When they saw me breastfeeding later, they had this queasy look on their face.  Clearly, they wanted to think of my boobs as something other than baby food, and that, frankly, pisses me off and makes me more determined than ever to breastfeed anywhere my baby feels like it.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	I am absolutely comfortable with a woman breastfeeding anywhere she needs. However, being in the restaurant business for 20 years, I have seen women go about it by completely revealing themselves.  This is unnecessary.  While this is the most natural and definitely the best food for newborns, a little discretion needs to be there when preparing to feed.  I watched a woman one day simply put a blanket over her shoulder and then open her shirt and bra.  Slick and unshowing.  Woman need to dress to suit breastfeeding in public, I guess that is the bottom line.  Otherwise, its fine with me.|`|7bFjuYvhaa	I think it is ok as long as there aren't small children around and they are covered. A poor mother may not be able to feed their child so they will feed them that way. Also, women should breast feed in a bathroom. Thats why some places have benches in the bathrooms.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	I love to see women NIP. If someone is ignorant and rude enough to make an ignorant or rude comment I'd be more than happy to educate them. :-D I think it makes nursing mom's lives a lot harder when they feel they can't/won't NIP because then they have to pump or hide... And a lot of covers scream "HI, I'M NURSING HERE! I'M BEING DISCREET!!!" Lmao!|`|50BdfHuDaa	Uncomfortable.  Period.  I don't want to look but its out there.  I breast feed my baby but I do it in private.  I live a sheltered nursing life.  I dont think the whole world needs to see my baby sucking on my breasts in public.  That's why in some modern malls they have nursing rooms just for this purpose.  That's where I go.  If I shop where not available,  I go find some place private,  less traveled and nurse there.  Every one has a choice and preference.  This is mine and I don't hate the mothers right to public nursing.  for myself I find it embarrassing.  If a mother is covered up with a blanky and does not expose herself while nursing looks more respectful towards the public who have to walk by and see it.  If I had to nurse in public,  I'd nurse covered up.  they know what your doing but can't see anything either which is great.|`|pEywMkogaa	woman that breastfeed in public face the same problem that nudists have to deal with. if some people find that a person that exposes any part of his/her body with no sexual intentions sexually provocative, is their problem.    i guess you can do nothing to stop a person nearby to find sexually appealing the act of breastfeeding if he/she decides it to find it so. people find sexually attractive other people even if they are not acting in a sexual way and have their "shameful areas" covered (like if the human body could be something to be ashamed of).    you have the right to expose any part of your body in public as long as your intentions are not sexual. if they find it sexually attractive, oh well. (rolling eyes)|`|lzbxT6p9aa	There is nothing more natural than a woman breasfeeding her baby.|`|nUo91lkraa	I see it as totally normal. I think people wich can see anything sexual in a mother breastfeeding..are sick.|`|6rZRZICuaa	i like it|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I have nursed at the baseball fields, in restaurants, in department stores (while walking around shopping), in the car and never had anyone react to me at all. It's my right to feed my baby and anyone who thinks my breast is for a man's sexual pleasure and should be hidden has another thing coming. I always smile at women I see nurse in public and have struck up conversations over our nursing babies.  Edit* I see a lot of people mention "being discreet." That is not one of my top concerns when breast feeding since my son is latched on to the part of my breast considered "indecent." But my rule of thumb is that if I'm showing only as much breast as I would in a summer top or one of my sun dresses I'm fine. No one gets offended at cleavage then so I figure the same amount should be more than fine if I'm feeding my baby.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	as long as the mom makes a reasonable effort not to expose her breast in public, i have absolutely no prob with them feeding their baby anywhere they happen to be
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Those are lovely Names,and I like them very much..|`|Elxuvon8aa	I sounds a little too churchy to me Old Amish one or the other would be wonderful|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I like Grace, but not Charity so much.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Sounds like a Very Godly Name    I know a girl name Gracia Laine.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	I love that name. They go good together and for a very cute baby girl.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Too virtuous. How about Grace Charmian (KAR-mee-an), Mercy Charmian or Greer Charity?|`|D6kwriPxaa	Isn't that the name of Sarah Palins next child?    Please don't hang that name on anyone.|`|sBGxS0mQaa	it sounds like a name a celebrity would use.  seems like you may be trying to be too creative.  if you choose Charity as one name, use a more common name for the first name.  Grace Charity doesnt work well together i think|`|qKDOpbc8aa	I DON'T THINK IT FLOWS NOW I THINK PERSONALLY IF YOU SWITCH IT TO CHARITY GRACE IT FLOWS BETTER IN GENERAL I LIKE BOTH NAMES|`|rZ9QcYgeaa	Personally, I'd stay away from doubling up on the virtue names.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	too much Grace is beautiful|`|gMMKww0faa	I love the name Grace but I'm not too keen on Charity, maybe something like Grace Lauren or Grace Ember?
IvkNTqDMaa	Madison!|`|NWEJdpocaa	I think Ava, Isabella, Sophia, Emma, and Madison are very overused. I love most of them and they are really cute names, but everyone else loves them too!!|`|VGij9p0Taa	The most overused baby names i here in my area are...   Girls:-   Paige   Madison,Madeleine is so much better ugh i beginning to despise Madison  Ellie-May   Georgia   and lots more   Boys:-   Caiden   Jacob  Jack   Kieran  and lots more..   I feel like say use something more orginial btw love your little girls name even though it is slightly common.|`|Def3uk2aaa	Madison, Mackenzie, Makayla are EVERYwhere.

I know 3 people having baby boys this year... all being named Ryder!!! Ugh. Ashlyn seems to be growing too.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Where I live, the most popular names where I live [the UK] are Jack and Olivia. If you call Jack or Olivia out in the street, at least a dozen people will turn around. Jake, Chris and Jessica are also super popular.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	Kaden and Jaden.|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Probably all my kids names: Katelynn, Christopher, and Tyler...lol!|`|fgRtf9CIaa	over used names go in cycles. In a few years there won't be as many babies named Madison or Jacob.  When my daughter Kristen was born (almost 26 years ago), Kristen was a common name.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	anything that ends with LYN or SON or DEN ...     I also used to think Jax was so original and cool, but now its SOOOOO overdone with Jaxon and people shortening it to Jax...    Its just waaaay to trendy now!|`|LMFOUJZhaa	Jessica  Brittney  Sarah  Haley  Ashley  Mary  Kyle  Benjamin  Christopher  there are so many of these in my school  its different in places cause a lot of people on yahoo answers say Ava, Aidon and Adison is overused to but I do not know one single Ava, Aidon and Adison and people I have talked to say they have never heard of that name, thats cause I live in the north though.  Also I know 2 Jacobs, I Kaitlyn, 1 Madison and don't know any Isabellas.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Ava  Jacob  Emily  Isabella  Madison  Caitlin/Kaitlyn etc  Aidan/Aiden/Aaden etc|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I love the name Kaitlyn but it is really common.

The most popular names I hear are:    Madison/Madelyn  Paige  Abigail/Abbey  Sarah  Megan  Grace    They all are incredibly overused. They've become the Ashleys and Jessicas and Britneys of the 80s. When I was growing up, there were ALWAYS other Ashleys in my classes!|`|DNygQdmVaa	my name is kathlyn :]    I hear neveah so much!  Im sick of it.|`|yB8djbeNaa	Jessica|`|5DJcir9saa	Yes Madison and Jacob are both extremely overused.  My boss said his son (who is 8) is in a class where just about every boy has a name starting with the letter J...three of which are Jacob!  Isabella and Emma are both a little overused as well.  And any name ending in "den"...like Hayden, Aidan, Jayden, etc.|`|4k5NJN29aa	Jacob with a K looks hideous.    The most over-used name I've noticed is Aiden and all its variations.    Kaitlyn isn't particularly common. It's not one of those retarded names that are spelled in such a manner that there will never be another one EVER, but I'm not sure that I've ever met one personally.  My kitty's name is Kaelyn. :)|`|CRvdmFwCaa	My name is Casey... I like about 5 Casey's.      I know about 10 Rachels.  Elizabeth's  Ashley's  Matthews, Shawns and Tom's.  Emily's.

Kaitlin is actually one of my favourite names but is too poular right now.  And Ava is getting common also.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	When I saw the question - I immediately thought "Madison." I clicked on it and read your description and laughed!    I think everyone named most of the names that I was thinking about.    I'm lucky - my son is Allen. There are very little Allen's (Alan, Allan, Alen) around. I love that.    My godson/nephew is Dax (which is gaining popularity)  My other nephew is Beau (popular around my area...Louisiana)  My niece is Khloe (which I think is pretty popular, too)|`|57X92zknaa	Haha, my little brother has two Jacobs in his class!    Also, I know three boys named Caden, which is really weird. I never knew it was that popular.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I feel like Ava, Isabelle and Madison are super popular right now.    People tell me some of the names (i.e. Mary and Claire) I like are 'common' but in their stead they suggest names like Olivia and Addison which are WAY more popular in this day and age.    For boys I feel like there are a lot of boys named: Jayden, Aiden, Ethan, Logan and Tristan.    People tell me my name is popular.  But I hadn't met another Natalie until I turned 16.  And though I know OF people with the same name as me I've only ever met the one.|`|v3IobQCgaa	Haha!  I think you've gotten a lot of interesting answers here, and I really have nothing to add, but I just wanted to say I really like the name Jakob Liam for a boy.  I decided if I ever have a boy, that'll be it.    But after reading all the responses here... wow.... I guess I'll pass on that.  :-)    I personally LOVE Jakob spelled with a "k"... and I will still always consider it for a middle name.  But I had no idea just how overused it was already.      I totally agree with Madison and Isabella, too.  I never understood about Isabella... I think that is a terrible name.  Gaudy.|`|wdXQaATDaa	Isabella [and any form of it...Bella...Belle...]  Kaitlyn...sorry but there are 8 in my graduating class..there names are just spelled different!!  Ashley    Jacob  Jason  Christopher|`|XkYhr4Vlaa	Brittany, Ashlee and Sarah|`|FK8gNlx0aa	Madison and Jacob definitely    Isabella  Isabelle  Izzi  Allison  Sarina or Serena  Julia  Kate or Katie  Amanda  Nicole  Catherine or Katherine, or etc.|`|CEAZWiU6aa	DEFINITELY Maddison, Jacob, Adison,|`|N6U9O0Pgaa	Definitely Jayden and Madison.

prqrQcd1aa	as long as he isn't getting cash assistance then yes, you will get some support for the child.   It usually takes about 2 months for everything to go through, this is paternity, fileing for support, going to the hearing and then the amount being determined.  It is not a long drawn out process, he helped create a child, he should help pay for it. I have a 3 year old, she has never seen her father once, and he still pays child support.    In my state if he doesn't have a good reason to not be working they will make him pay a small amount of money at first, and then tell him he has so many days to proove he has been looking or else has found a job. They can't turn down a job if they are looking either, and yes, there are many things that can happen if they don't pay their support.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I'm a dad and i can, but i havent.  Thats only cause i have the means to take care of them myself.  It sounds like a waste really since he's a bum but they are his kids too. i was in the same situation the mom didnt work or do anything...so i dont know...maybe if you do demand child support he'll step up and work more.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	After raising my daughter for 8 years without her father's help, in March of this year I decided to file on him. We had court 3 times and finally received my first support check in July. He has a good job...so i am not sure about a father on government assistance. Don't expect to receive support right away. There is a process that you will have to go through. Good luck!
p0prrzf2aa	okay..so WHY does it matter if he goes to your school or not?|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	why would they send you to boot camp for meeting a new friend? honestly...
GFzDwIk6aa	I like Madelynn and Sophia Nicole, but I don't like the spelling.  Madelyn Sophia Nicole is cute.  Don't like the boy's name.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I dont get the three name thing.  Why not just first and middle.  I'd like Sophia Nicole or Madelynn Leigh.  Your boy's choice is great!|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I like Madelynn Skye Williams    and Evan Montgomery Williams|`|FK8gNlx0aa	im not really a fan of Maureen, but i really think the rest of that name flows well together. i love Madelynn. Lena is also a nice name. Evan Montgomery Williams ALSO sounds good.    Great Choices!!!|`|o4NRcsAHaa	i like all the 3 girl names but i do not like the midddle name. i would not want to have that middle name. its horrible!! who names there kid evan MONTGOMERY>??|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like your first Two girls names.Not sure about lena leigh they are to similar sounding.And I like your boys name.I have a son Evan michael.|`|lEY4zGM7aa	I like the first two names and for the girls and the boys name is fine.
BW7Nrqjzaa	I wouldn't pay more then $5 for a onesie. Especially a used one. It's really cute though.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I really wouldn't spend anything on it.  I'm not a fan of the Burberry plaid.  Sorry but honest|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I don't know anyone who would pay more than $10 for a onesie. If I'm spending $80 on clothes, I better walk away with at least 8 outfits. Why would someone spend so much on something that will only be worn for a month?    Edit: Not brutal, just cheap.  ;-D|`|iTEf1dP3aa	You wasting $80 on a onesie was soooo pointless. Thats what happens, you spend an arm and a leg on something that if you REALLY think about it doesnt matter, then you want to try to get profit from it....granted you may like looking good or your child...but like you said, only used it a few times, you could have bought a diaper bag with 80$ to match something you both are wearing...$40 for a used onsie...sorry...good luck though...  The MOST I'd pay for a BRAND NEW burberry onesie would be $15...|`|DIZKlxNraa	I think it is overpriced. I would pay probably up to $20 for it.|`|gERIlomEaa	WOW, I can't believe they make onsies that expensive.  Honestly, many people can't afford to spend $80 on an entire outfit for themselves so the chance of selling a ONE ONSIE to someone for $40 is slim...|`|B5OY58Dpaa	neg.  an u may get more 4 it git a time and last day of bidding u get more than u ask sometimes.|`|DR4LYQBtaa	I agree with the other answers. I wouldn't buy a used onesie. I definitely wouldn't expensive brand name clothes for my baby. You shouldn't've bought it for $80 either! So if you really want to sell it, $10 tops|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	I wouldn't pay $40 for a used product you need to bring the price down some|`|OxFV92hJaa	I've never spent more than $3 on a onsie for any of my 3 kids.     I don't care if the thing is made by the pope lol.    For someone like me, it's way beyond over priced. For others that buy that kind of thing, I don't know.|`|AA12205301	I don't buy name brands for my kids. I can find clothes that are perfect at the thrift store.  I wouldn't buy it for more than $1.00. Sorry, but I am a thrifty shopper and I realize that babies do not need name brand or expensive clothing. They are going to puke on it and grow out of it. I buy thrift store, kmart, walmart etc for my little ones. Why spend money that you don't have on things like that?|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Honestly, I personally wouldn't pay more then $5 dollars for a used onesie, even if it was expensive when purchased brand new.  Brand names don't mean much to me when buying used items.  I have gotten really nice brand name items at once upon a child for under $5.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, no one is buying it because $40 for a onesie is absolutely ridiculous, used or NEW.    $5, like others have said, would be my limit on a used onesie. The highest I'd pay for a onesie is probably $15. We just got our son one at Baby Gap that I couldn't resist because it had a picture of a pig on it and says "Little Ham" and that one was around $13.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I would never buy a Burberry onesie, used or new.  Honest answer.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Honestly- I it looks in great shape and it is really cute- but I won't pay more than 10 or 15 dollars for any onesie.  They just get too messy from baby spit up.|`|xK6wehG7aa	Honestly I wouldn't but a onesie for that price, not when I can go to Target and get one for $4.00 brand new. They're going to pee on it and spit up on it, so there's no way I'd pay that much for it. I would try dropping it down to $20.00 and see what happens, I wouldn't pay more than $8.00 personally.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Wish I could afford a onesie like that but I, too, would not spend more than $5-$10 one a onesie.  It is very cute.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I would never ever spend that kind of money on any onesie... it's a onesie for cripes sake! I don't care who makes it...I think companies like Burberry pray on parents of babies and make them think their onesies are all superior then they really aren't.     In truth I'd pay no more than $5 for a used onesie... it that.     Try lumping together a bunch of clothes and selling them for $25...that way people think they are getting a deal rather than jipped. That onesie isn't even cute really...it's just a checkered onesie. Designer cothing for babies is pointless....|`|NAzAmFDnaa	A onsie is a onsie.  That onsie doesn't look very special, and will get puked on and pooped on just the same as any other onsie.  I wouldn't even buy a onsie at Goodwill, I'd rather get some new Carter's or Gerber brand.  We are in a recession lady.  If you are rich enough to spend $40.00 on a onsie, then you probably won't buy it used anyway.  Babies arn't impressed with designer clothes and anybody who loves me and my baby won't be impressed either.  If I spend $40.00 on a used onsie, my mother would slap me, my sister would cry and my husband would take away my credit card!|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	Even though it's Burberry, I think it's WAY overpriced for a used piece of clothing. I know they're very expensive new, but what you're selling is still used. I'd try to sell it for $10.00 and be happy if I got that. GOOD LUCK!|`|FplTPoAyaa	I wouldn't pay for a used onesie, no matter what label is on it.  Onesies (I use Gerber) are inexpensive, so why put a used one on your baby ? Babies outgrow clothes so quickly....I don't think I would pay $40 (much less $80) for any item of baby clothing.  Good luck selling it....I don't think you're going to be very successful.
iWrXIWcPaa	thats how i was with my first! my baby didnt even drop until maybe the day i went into labor. i had no contractions. i didnt even notice the gradual loss of my mucus plug because (the dr said) it just came out in such little amounts that i couldnt tell the difference. all the sudden, 5 days before my due date my water broke at 3 am and i started having contraction 2-3 hours after my water broke and then i had my baby at 11:20 am. so you could just be like me, lucky, no problems or signs or difficulties then all the sudden you have your wonderful baby! i hope your delivery goes well!|`|MtC3CWZraa	You have *up to* five weeks left. That's loads of time for things to start happening.|`|s6stLtvLaa	It is common for your first baby to be late.  And if it is a boy, they usually come later than girls do.  Some women don't have pre labor signs and just skip right into labor (or their water breaks).  I had all the pre labor signs weeks before my water broke.  My water broke and 3 hours later I still was not having regular contractions, so they had to induce me.  Your baby will probably drop soon, My son dropped a month before I had him, and even then I didn't feel much pressure in my pelvic from it.|`|cfdooGylaa	Hun you have another 3 weeks to go. Some people have no signs of labor and then out of nowhere labor just sneaks up on them in the same day. Just hang in there, its almost over.|`|NLxcfGplaa	I had no signs at all just hard to find comfy way to sleep.  Up to 40 weeks and beyond went past due date with all 3 kids.  I Had to be induced.  Goodluck and hang in there.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	well at 37 weeks i should hope u dont have any signs of labour! your pregnant for forty weeks so just hang in there for a few more weeks x|`|rnTNu6MTaa	I am 37 weeks too .

Every women experience different signs of labor some more some less. I felt nothing even when dilated 2 cm and had lost my plug. On the day my baby came, the day be for my due date i was in labor all day but didn't know it. Had my first contraction, water started leaking, went to the hospital it broke and then went on to having the baby. In all from first contraction to birth my labor was 4 hours and easy. Be thank full that you are comfortable.|`|dgM66nRBaa	I'm 38 wks pregnant with no signs of labor|`|gdnL63ngaa	My mom said the best way to get your baby in the proper position is to wash the floors!    Or at least ensure your knees are below your hips.   Walking exercising, or even taking 10 minutes down on all 4's while watching tv
1ezYfkX7aa	My first baby i had a feeling it was a boy and it was..my 2nd i thought for sure it was a girl...nope it was a boy....my third i thought i was another boy and it was a girl...my last baby witch i am currently 29wks...i honestly thought it was a boy but its a girl =)...the old wives tales that i took...everyone i took said something different so you just have to wait it out =). Congrats on your pregnancy and goodluck tomm.|`|256cVXsmaa	I am going through the exact same thing... ahh it sucks, I just want to go out and start buying some cute clothes.  I am 19.3 weeks and my belly is also round and i'm carrying low as well.  I am pretty sure that you always carry low in the beginning of pregnancy though.  Everyone says boys carry low and people constantly tell me I am having a boy but my doctor assured me that that is not accurate at all.  we all carry low at first I guess??  You will just have to wait till tomorrow, although you are soooo lucky because you find out so soon =D    Another wives tale is,  if you are craving sweet foods your having a girl  salty foods your having a boy.|`|kT7GVOosaa	usually low and sticking out is a boy but I am a little high and sticking out and having a boy so you never know. you can go to google and type in baby gender quizzes and take some fun little quizzes. they may not be right but it is fun to see. good luck!|`|4d8yOK3iaa	I remember being there. I just knew that I was having a little girl, and I was RIGHT. I did the online old wives tale test and quizes and they all said I was having a little girl as well. I carried her high even now that im due in a couple weeks she still manages to feel high to me. I just remember in the first months I had morning sickness, craved sweets, dreamed of having a little girl, and carried her high. And my belly didn't get huge right away either. Good luck and congrats. Its so exciting. Im just anxiously awaiting the arrival of my little girl now.|`|KUoHMBKRaa	I am 17 weeks pregnant and i read these articles and took these quizzes...    http://www.babiesonline.com/articles/pre...    http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/oldwives...    http://www.childbirth.org/articles/boyor...    http://www.babyzone.com/pregnancy/fetal_...

Mine were :)|`|92318d2de373ecc807b1a2e15fbad4b6aa	There will many different answers on "ways you can tell" however it not always true. I carried low too and I had a boy. But it is possible for you to be carrying low now and the baby move up so...    Good luck...I know the feeling! Boys are awesome|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	They say if your carrying high its a girl, low for a boy.

I think you'll just have to wait for tomorrow and pray that the baby will show you, because sometimes they don't
C8E3fe3xaa	No, symptoms are not the same for everyone during pregnancy. The only symptoms i had during my first trimester was increased urination and fatigue.|`|sMvWJDqsaa	everyone is different..I had no morning sickness and have been able to drink coffee, soda etc...but during the first few months I was so exhausted that at times I could not move off the couch...I would sit there looking around wanting to get up, but just could not do it...I also got really emotional at the silliest things like a sappy commercial...I have also been STARVING...I could eat and then 20 minutes later be hungry again...now that I am 18 weeks some of the early symptoms are getting better, like I can make it through most of the day without having to take a 3 hour nap...but other things, such as sensitivity to bright light are just beginning..|`|lRq81lu7aa	Every one is different from everyone else.  First child, a little nauseous, weight gain, no period, didn't feel much until the end.<br>  <br>  This child, very nauseous around smells of cooking meat, can't drink coffee cause it makes me sick, very emotional, exhausted all the time.<br>  <br>  You never know until you have blood work done to know for sure.|`|TprIqGhCaa	I had diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.

gMMKww0faa	Maxwell, Maximilian, Maxfield, Maximus, Maxy, Maxey, Maxson, Maxx, Maximo, Maximilianus, Maximo, Maxim, Maxie. I think I prefer Maxwell or Maxey/Maxy xD|`|RW5qYm5iaa	We are having the same problem... makes me think the name Max might be too popular...    We dedided to go with Max Solomon for now (middle name after my grandfather). I think Max is a solid enough name to go on it's own as long as its balanced with a longer middle name.    Do you think Max is going to be too popular now??? That worries me a little and I am thinking about not using it.|`|xBtf4h1baa	also maxine,... maxwell, maximus, hmm maxson?|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	the only one other than maxwell is maximus.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I LOVE Maxwell.

You don't have to go w/all the longer versions if you don't wish to.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I like the name Max, but I didn't like either of the full names so i just ended up deciding on a different name.  Are you against just naming him Max? You could give him a little longer middle name to balance it.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	maxim|`|xJhwWJdmaa	Maxim Alexander would be a beautiful name!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like Max better on its own.But maximus is anthor one.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I loved the movie "Gladiator", so I'd have to say "Maximus".    It's not like you'd be using his full name unless you were angry with him, and you and everyone else would jst be calling him Max.    I like Maximilian though, if you are asking for one or the other. Maxwell reminds me of "Get Smart."|`|57X92zknaa	Maxwell  Maximilian + all its variatioins  Maximiliano  Maxime  Maximus    I know a boy with middle name Maximilian and he thinks it's really cool!|`|rZ9QcYgeaa	Maksym.|`|pOekC2Sqaa	You can also have:    Maxim  Maximo  Maximos  Maximus  Maxton     Out of your bunch I prefer Maximilian, though, I personally just think that Max should just be left on its own. I'm not a fan of Max names.     G2B|`|n9MwPbYXaa	Maxwell.     I'd go with Maxwell Jude, but I am the Beatles freak. Two Beatles references in one name is like my cocaine.|`|Uu2OyVM7aa	There's Maxwell, Maximillion, and Maximus, but I personally recommend you just name him Max. BTW a good middle name would be Jonathan.|`|ATpKrr2Oaa	how about maxfield.  as in maxfield parrish? http://www.bpib.com/illustrat/parrish.ht...|`|lEY4zGM7aa	It doesn't have to have max in the name, it could be mason william ________  and his nick name can still be max as his nick name|`|i2RSpZ6caa	I heard of someone being named Maddox with nickname Max. I really like Maddox.    I like Maxwell OK (does remind me of Maxwell House coffee though) but I don't care for Maximilian - it sounds too regal and snobbish.

If you take a clean, wet,  white cloth and gently rub from the top of the gum down, it will remove the film that sometimes can build up from the formula or breast milk.  I wouldn't suggest a toothbrush until your child actually gets teeth, the toothbrush can be very rough for a little ones gums and/or tongue.  You can wipe his/her tongue also with a clean white cloth.  As far as thrush goes, just make sure that your baby's bottle/nipple is clean at all times, and anything that enters their mouth.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	I washed my baby's tongue with a wet wash cloth. I didn't do it often though. I did it because milk would build up on her tongue and it would be white. Now she has teeth, so I brush her teeth and gums daily.|`|87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	If your baby is breastfed and is not receiving anything else by mouth (formula has added sugar, btw), then there is no reason to clean his or her mouth. Breastmilk has antibacterial substances which will kill any "bad" bacteria in baby's mouth.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Yep, I wiped my sons mouth daily from day one.  It helps prevent milk build up and bacteria and promotes healthy teeth before the even emerge.    I was advised to do so by my doctor.  Just use a soft damp wash cloth.|`|r52rfBkeaa	Nope, you don't have to clean their mouths.  Actually, if you try to, you're introducing bacteria that they don't have and could cause them to get sick.    You can't prevent thrush - it either happens or it doesn't.  If it does, there's medicine for both baby and mommy so you shouldn't worry it.  It's not super common, but the doctor will check their mouths at all of their checkups to make sure everything is ok. :)|`|aBnZRJOcaa	idk but i would like to know|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I started cleaning my babies mouths once they started eating real food. I just used a corner of a clean face cloth. Once they get teeth I bought those little tooth brushes that fit over your finger.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	With my first i was told to after feedings just a baby washcloth with cold water over your forefinger you rub the gums very carefully and gently they also sell a toothbrush that fits over your forefinger made for baby gums i think i found hers at kmart
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Firstly you have to understand that "vitamin D" isn't a vitamin its a prohormone that was erroneously labeled a vitamin.  Your body is meant to produce vitamin D when exposed to the sun, and it doesn't take much.  In the winter at 49 degrees latitude it takes 2 hours a WEEK of head and hand exposure for baby to make enough.    However if mom is deficient during pregnancy then breastfeeding and sun exposure may not be enough.  For one thing if mom is deficient then her milk will be lower in vitamin D.  However there have been no cases of rickets in breastfed babies that did not have obvious risk factors usually including two of the following:  Dark skinned, mom gets no sun exposure (religious clothing), mom eats no dairy products, baby gets little or no sun exposure.    Even then supplementation by the oral route is risky.  In many places there are no drops that do not contain vitamin A.  Breastmilk is high in vitamin A, supplementation with retinol (preformed vitamin A) can cause overdose.  Vitamin D itself taken orally can cause severe problems if too much is given including kidney and cardio vascular problems.  There was recently 8 kids hospitalized in Boston from cow's milk that had excessive levels of added vitamin D (cow's milk does not naturally contain vitamin D).  Many vitamin D drops also contain peanut oil, though they claim with all the protein removed, however studies show babies given drops or formula with vitamins in a peanut oil base are more likely to have a positive skin prick or RAST to peanuts.    The safest way to ensure vitamin D adequacy for mom and baby is to use the sun, or failing that a sun lamp.  Sun lamps are relatively expensive but when used properly they do not increase the risks of skin cancer.    http://www.infactcanada.ca/breastmilk_an...  Who is at risk?    Reported reviews of the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency rickets also suggest otherwise. A six-year review4 of all cases at the Calcium and Bone Clinic of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto identified 17 cases (from January 1988 to December 1993). Parents had sought medical attention because of bowing of the lower limbs. On examination all the children had radiographic and clinical evidence of rickets. All the children presented were of African or Asian origin consumed no cow's milks were not taken outdoors regularly and if taken outdoors would be covered up. The mothers reported that they did not drink milk or consumed vitamin supplements during pregnancy.    Similar findings5 are reported in other reviews. The Children's Hospital of New Jersey and UMD, Newark, reported only nine cases over a three-year period. All children were dark skinned, were breastfed and had restricted exposure to sunlight.    The susceptibility to vitamin D deficiency rickets, of dark-skinned infants in populations who have immigrated from tropical climates to cold northern climates has long been recognized. Higher levels of melanin, a natural sun screen, requires more exposed sunlight than white skinned populations to produce the same amount of vitamin D. And in white-skinned infants the application of sunscreen blocks the synthesis of vitamin D after ultraviolet radiation. When infants are then also confined to the indoors throughout cold winters or are fully covered, the possibility of inadequate exposure to ultraviolet light and inadequate maternal storage increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency.              The amount of sun exposure needed to maintain adequate 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels in the normal range in the breastfed infant is as follows:        Summer time _ infant wearing only a diaper _ 30 minutes per week        Winter time _ clothed infant not wearing a hat _ 2 hours per week      http://www.llli.org//Release/vitamind.ht...  Vitamin D" is a steroid hormonemisclassified as a vitamin in 1922that is produced in the body upon exposure of the skin to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in sunlight. Rickets is the bone-softening disease of childhood caused by inadequate exposure to UVB radiation.    Very few foods naturally contain significant amounts of vitamin D. The biologically normal and most common means of obtaining adequate levels of vitamin D for human beings, including infants, is through casual exposure of the skin to sunlight. Because the skin has a large capacity to produce vitamin D, adequate levels can be developed from partial exposure of the body to small amounts of sunlight well before sunburn occurs. According to the World Health Organization and United Nations Childrens Fund, small amounts of UVB radiation are beneficial for people and essential in the production of vitamin D. However, excessive sunlight exposure can cause sunburn and increase the risk of skin cancer.    Concerns about sunlight deficiency, vitamin D and breastfeeding have been raised by a new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical report. The AAP now recommends that all infants have a minimum intake of 200 IU of|`|333c5241bfa6c1a5e5841be0e72681faaa	Vitamin D is especially common where there is little sun.  I live in Germany and we all need extra Vitamin D because of the very short days and cloudcover.  If your baby is going to get regular sun, then I wouldn't worry about it.  While I agree that breastmilk is perfect for our babies in theory, it relies heavily on the quality of the mother's diet.  Junk in, junk out.  My diet isn't perfect. That's why I have continued to take my vitamins.      I give them to my daughter after a feeding.  She is calmer that way.  They don't seem to taste bad to her.  Of course, she is used to them by now.|`|FplTPoAyaa	We started giving our baby vitamin drops when she started drinking cow's milk and stopped formula.  She is a very picky eater and we have trouble getting her to eat veggies and fruit.  We put a dropperful into her juice.  Yes, they taste awful, but the juice masks the taste (I tried it myself). Our doctor didn't recommend the drops until after she stopped drinking formula.  Good luck with your baby !!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	i've read that some babies don't get enough sun exposure & breastmilk is lacking in vitamin.  but then I've read recently (sorry don't remember where) that breastmilk contains something that is similar to vitamin D or turns into vitamin D.  I don't think fair skinned babies are as prone to vit deficiency as darker skinned babies.  My doc recommended the vitamin D but said my Bfed son doesn't really need it every day.  I just add it to a bottle of breastmilk.  It tastes terrible,  but he is getting used to it & will take it mixed w/only 1 ounce of milk now|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My doctor hasn't recommended vit D for my breastfed baby and I probably wouldn't give him the drops anyway.  I beleive that breastmilk is perfect and doesn't need supplements.  A little sunlight goes a long way for helping to make vitamin D naturally.  I just open my blinds while playing with my baby in the living room.|`|DIZKlxNraa	I use them with solid foods. Now Academy of Pediatrics changed their minds and they recomend it even for breastfed babies.|`|wTeJulT5aa	My doctor prescribed them, but I rarely use them.  My baby drinks formula, so I don't think it's needed.  Also, we do get a little sun a few times a week.  I live in Saudi Arabia, and I think they just give them to everyone because it gets very hot here, and most people only go outside at night.
xy5UNiELaa	It's very possible for you to be pregnant!  Most of your signs could also be due to stress, but as for the veins in your breasts, that's a very early sign of pregnancy.  You know what to do.  Hope you get the answer you want!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Yes, the veins in the breasts are the really tell tale signs.  So are ya gonna get back together?|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	If he came in you, you of course have a chance of being pregnant.

So asking on here if it sounds like you are, is a silly question, because to any of us, you make it sound like you are pregnant.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	Do you sound like you're ?????? - Irresponsible?    Yes.
6ea856e3826885a5e91b108d3f52cd32aa	I was in the same situation.  I have a 6 year old son and my husband and I were married in July.  I have been a single mom for so long, that I was content with one child. My husband on the other hand did not have children.  We talked many, many hours on the subject.  He was also the only boy out of three kids and the last to carry on his name.  After I became pregnant (1month after we were married), he decided that two children would be plenty.  I have not been the easiest person to live with....Also, we are having to rearrange the house, look at daycares, and begin the baby proofing process.  He is discovering how much work goes into a baby.  He had already agreed that two would be great when we found out it was a BOY.  God had it figured out the entire time.|`|faPKwClPaa	Wow.    So, if you have a girl, what's his plan?  Ignore the poor thing?  Resent her?    I can't believe you're seriously thinking about marrying this control freak.  This is NOT normal behavior, it is not acceptable, and it's just plain stupid.  In this day and age of hyphenated names and kids with last names that differ from their parents, is it really that big of a deal to "carry on his name?"  I mean, seriously -- unless your last name is 'Kennedy' or 'Getty' or something like that, no one cares.    Think long and hard about getting tangled up with this guy.  Pregnancy, childbirth, and children are all a crap shoot -- and if he can't handle or roll with the variables that are going to be thrown his way, cut your loses now.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I wouldn't say either of you are being selfish. This is a question which needs to be resolved before you get married. If you can't then don't.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	NO that is not selfish!!    The male's chomosome is the one that determines whether or not the baby is a boy or girl, so if you don't have a boy its his fault, not yours! (well its not really his "fault", but his sperm is the one that controls it)    So I don't think you should have to go through multiple pregnancies just to give him a boy.    Who says a girl can't carry on his name anyway? A lot of women nowadays keep their last name even when they get married and have kids.    And I don't think a "name" is that important anyway, its that fact that he will have a lineage of his genes. You could name your kid Bozo the Clown and it would still be YOUR kid. So that is a little immature in my opinion for him to be so caught up about the name, or the sex of your baby.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	If you weren't willing to give him a child at all, I would call you selfish, but you are willing.  Married couples make compromises all the time,.  If you want ONE more and he wants TWO more....he'll have to be willing to compromise or HE is the selfish one.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I kept my name.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, you are not.  You two are simply not a match, this is a huge area that you must match on perfectly before going any further with your relationship.  Time to move on, to hopefully find someone with whom you are VERY clear about your wants and needs - and you are in total synch.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	You are not being selfish lol i think he is.  He needs to get over it and feel lucky if the kid is healthy regardless of whether its a boy or girl.  The fact that its healthy is a miracle in itself he needs to figure that out.|`|AA11537580	he can adopt your child and give them his last name|`|e9YFTyzZaa	ADOPT!  Or, Try once and see.  If not, Adopt a 'boy' and he'll have your Husbands name!  Don't count on 1 or 2 Pregnancies to have a Boy. You may be very Fortunate to have a boy or be like My Older Brother and have  "5" yes, 5 Girls!!|`|v3IobQCgaa	Your boyfriend is the one being selfish.  He really needs to get over himself and his name.  What matters is that you guys raise a noble human being that's worthy of carrying on ANY name... not just his.    And frankly?  With this guy's values instilled in this child, that may be difficult.  If he's this immature over this issue, it's a safe bet this mindset carries over into other areas as well.  So if you have a girl, that won't be good enough.  He wants to keep trying until he gets what he REALLY wants?  Wow... nice lovely story for your daughter later on.... you were a mistake, so we had to keep trying for your brother.    And what if you guys have two girls in a row?      Dump him.... he needs to grow up.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I don't think you are being selfish at all and I think he is being quite silly.     There is no guarantee that a boy will carry on his name anyway. Perhaps this boy wont' have any children for a variety of reasons. What a terrible burden to place on a child.     If it were me, this kind of a stipulation would be enough reason for me to not marry someone.|`|A89ezcg5aa	I don't think you're selfish.  I mean, I understand where he's coming from with the family-name thing, but what if you have 7 girls, lol?  Will he still want to keep trying for a boy? That wouldn't be fair to you, ecspecially sine you let him know from the begining you didn't want a truck-load of kids.  That's my take on it.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	no that's not selfish, you can go to a fertility specialist and they can show you ways to ensure you have a boy. You get to only have 2 kids and he gets to have a son. everybody wins.|`|rlhsdcAXaa	You're not being selfish at all. It's your body and if you decide not to have more children, then I'd say he has to find a way to deal with it.|`|0QYIbn1saa	You're not being selfish, your boyfriend is.|`|qImMwhUHaa	In a way you are being selfish because you don't want to fully devote your whole life to being a mom of many children which you already know is about self sacrifice but at least you know that. If you don't want more than two kids then you shouldn't have more than two. You could end up being resentful towards your husband or your new child. If he's so into having a name carried on then I suggest adopting a boy child. If he's not ok with that then he's the one who is being selfish. That's not a good reason for people to continue having babies especially if the mom isn't in it 100%.

Irdj2KAFaa	Possibly the cereal, but most likely he is teething.|`|yB8djbeNaa	sounds like teething but it could be due to the cereal stop giving the cereal for a few days if the problem clears up then try again with the cereal and see if it gets worse again if it gets worse then take him for an allergy test to things such as wheat|`|xL16bC3waa	I would tend to believe that he is teething, it is amazing how much they change when that happens. I have a 6 mos old and she is normally very happy, she doesn't want solids at all right now and she is very irritated all the time. Her sleeping patterns have changed, she is not the same baby right now. I would give him some tylenol, and only feed formula and see if the spitting up stops, if not call doctor. Maybe the cereal has constipated him more.Give him one of those gerber baby juices, this always helps clean out my daughter.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Sounds like he is teething and or has a bit of gas going on. Try burping him after every bottle of milk and giving him less food...|`|8x1m3T5Taa	teething.Docter|`|83j1ThU7aa	maybe teething but the throwing up could be alot of baby food n or milk (formula) cause my son went thru the same thing.. one nite he was sooo cranky i wanted to cry & scream.. my husband was out i was by myself.. didnt want a pacifer, bottle, sleep, play, chill, watch tv lol.. and i gave him lil tylenol he was coughing & runny nose n he dont like the taste n started coughing so i patted his back n he threw up.. like an adult but after hewas alrite..so could be that|`|leGfABH4aa	It could be teething, my daughter did this and threw up on me and the next day she had a tooth. I would also stop the cereal and see if that helps. then start it again later if it happens again, get some testing to see if he has problems
scdOdaTKaa	The luteal phase is teh time between the day you ovulated and the day of your next cycle, average is 14 days if you have a 28 day cycle. I have a 35 day cycle so I'm not sure of mine. This is the time where the egg would be fertilized and implant hopefully...good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|qX8EFFVtaa	It is the time from ovulation to the beginning of your next cycle.  A normal luteal phase is at least 12 days.  A luteal phase shorter than 12 days can be a cause of infertility. This is because the fertilized egg needs time to implant in the uterine wall.  If the luteal phase is too short, the egg may fertilize but not implant properly, this would lead to the egg being flushed out with the menstral fluid.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	It's the time after you ovulate until your af starts good luck|`|jaP0TANdaa	The luteal phase is the time between ovulation and your period. Most say you need at least 10 days to successfully conceive, others say at least 12 days. That's why I'm guessing your issue right now is REALLY late ovulation for such long cycles (or perhaps no ovulation at all) because the luteal phase is almost always the same and hardly ever (like one in a billion) will go past 16 days or so.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	when your next cycle begin.|`|AAbGMKo5aa	U know I wanted to know that 2 lol thanx 4 asking the question :-]|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|TtutLPsQaa	Hey! The luteal phase is the second phase, after ovulation. It's when you're supposed to have enough progesterone to be able to support a fertilized egg implanting. If you have too much, or not enough, chances are it won't take.|`|KEu8nqEQaa	It is the number of days from the day AFTER ovulation until the first day of your next cycle. It should range from 12-16 and remain pretty consistent each month. **Baby Dust**|`|QB5D0rG4aa	The Luteal Phase is a term that is used in describing the time period that's calculated from the day after ovulation and runs through the remainder of a monthly cycle.

Only formula or breastmilk until 1yr old.|`|aMpMFLo3aa	wait till baby is one years old :)|`|xL16bC3waa	Are you meaning, like gallon milk? I don't think that is a good idea. Infants need formula until one year for certain reasons. There are so many important vitamins and nutrients that are in formula, that aren't in regular milk. These nutrients are key to helping baby grow and develop correctly, they have DHA and ARA. These are the nutrients that help the brain and spinal cord. Unless your doctor says it is ok, I would continue the formula until one year.  Mother of 2 children.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Not until your baby is 12 months old.  If you need help with the cost of formula, contact your local WIC office.
gfuybX4Faa	Here's the thing - she's NOT a single mother. Her daughter has an involved father, PLUS a wonderful stepmom who has shown her the high road. Kudos to you for being so open and willing to involve her mom, but, if I were you, I would stop inviting her to all the activities. If the stepdaughter asks any questions, just tell her the truth - the environment becomes toxic when her mom is around. She obviously feels the tension and manipulation, and it may actually be a relief to her to get away. You also have to think about your other babies. Protect them from this malcontent. As they get older, she may start involving them in her venom-spewing. Good luck!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Maybe she is just jealous of you. I do think it is great that you want to include her in thing but if I were you I would stop that now. When your step daughter with with her dad, that time is for him to be with his daughter.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My best suggestion would be to record these conversations and show them to a judge and ask for more custody and that she take anger management classes. Proof is golden in a situation like this. <br>  <br>  Remember: It will piss her off more if you are kind as possible, think annoyingly, sugary sweet. Kill her with kindness, lol. You will be able to go to bed at night knowing you were as nice as possible. Stay strong for your stepdaughter, she sounds like she needs an emotionally stable women in her life.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Sounds like she's bitter because he's moved on from their relationship in a major way (married with 2 kids) while she hasn't.<br>  <br>  That's a tough pill for many people to swallow when their former partners move on, especially when they have children<br>  <br>  Good for you for being so open minded and flexible. It's a shame she's too immature to behave herself...|`|lzivF4Idaa	if she wants to be rude then simply have no contact with her. <br>  <br>  i have no idea how she feels cuz nobody else can deal with my ex for long amounts of time. im the only one since i was 15 that can tolerate him for long with his nonsense. ***calling all ladies***....you can take him off my hands!!! im tired of phone calls crying to come back!!!!
Fei8s7vdaa	I think we all deserve to know where we came from, even if our birth parents aren't as great as our adopted family.      However, some birth parents don't want to be found, and if that's the case, they should at least provide a detailed family history, so the adopted child can read about where their family came from.  Not just genetic and health stuff, but maybe interesting stories from their past.  Like if the mother came from a large family, or if the father served in the military.....|`|7C9Ett7Caa	I would say yes, if the adoptive parent decides to let the child know that they were adopted..|`|sY3EVjXnaa	no|`|356f8f209dcd6dc30f57b5bcaa4830f6aa	Yes.
AA11763950	What did your doctor say???|`|lSAdkvDFaa	higher levels of hcg can indicate a multiple birth babe.  x|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Average hCG levels:    3 weeks 5-50  4 weeks 5-426  5 weeks 19-7,340  6 weeks 1,080-56,500  7-8 weeks 7,650-229,000  9-12 weeks 25,700-288,000    Looks like you are better than normal!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	As far as I can tell, your HCG level is normal.  I just looked at a chart online.  If your doctor didn't say it was abnormal, then you have nothing to worry about!|`|R7U1sDd1aa	When I had my HCG level done the day after I missed my period, which meant I would have been like 4 weeks exactly, My Hcg was 14. This chart on my lab slip show the ranges of your HCG level. it can vary, and is only app:    0-1 week  0-50  1-2 weeks 40-300  2-3 weeks 100-1000  3-4 weeks 500-6000  1-2 months 5000-200,000  2-3 months 10,000-100,000  2nd Trimester 3000-50,000  3rd Trimester 1000-50,000    Also, my Progesterone levels were low because I only have one ovary (had it removed d/t a Teratoma in 2005), and my level was only 7.3 when I first got pregnant. I had to use a cream until I was 12 weeks along, and everything is fine now. You said yours is 96.1, and I believe by going offf the chart, it's right along for your first trimester. Here's the chart from my lab slip so you can have a look:    Progesterone during pregnancy:  1st Trimester 11.2-90.0  2nd Trimester 25.5-89.4  3rd Trimester 48.4-422.5    Soooo, by going off of this, I would say that you are doing alright. Everyone is different, and has different levels. I was worried at first because mine was so low, but I followed up with my OBGYN, and this was at the end of Oct. 08. I'm now currently 18 weeks, and we are expecting a little boy July 8th, and everything is GREAT! I bet everything is just fine. I hope this helped you. Good luck.. 8)
qgJDdCiHaa	You'll be fine. Don't listen to anyone who says you'll die from getting pregnant! uughhh the stupidity knows no bounds! Anyway, they will probably go from ultrasound and take a quantitive hcg level. It can sort of give an indication about how far along you might be, and given we know that you were negative by a certain day and working forward, they should be able to nail it down to within 2wks which is all they could get off of LMP anyway.|`|jNllSJtEaa	If you knew when you ovulated then they cant tell from around those days,but if not then they will probably now from ultrasound,theyll measure your uterus and the baby.    Dont let the christmas lights person scare you, you are fine, the main reason they tell you to wait a few months is so youthey can calculate your dates better, as long as you go to the doc and have him cheack you out i think your pregnancy will be fine,your body wouldnt let you get pregnant if it wasnt ready to.    Good luck and Congrats!!|`|iPeiGJpYaa	I would go to your doctors a.s.a.p since you just had a miscarriage he would probably give you and ultrasound a.s.a.p that would give you a rough amount of how far along you are. I haven't had that happen or even heard of that happening. But I guess it is not impossible.Wish you all the best!|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would call the DR right away and ask if you are healthy enough to safely carry this child and not put your own health at risk. I really doubt its safe to be right now. People are not rabbitts, take better care of yourself. Im going to be mad if you die from this because its too hard on your body.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Most likely you became pregnant a couple of weeks after the miscarriage.  The bleeding that you had during the miscarriage would be similar to a period as far a your cycle is concerned.  Your Doctor will be able to tell when you have your first ultrasound the approximate date. (how far along you are).|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	ultrasound probably.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	They will determine as best as possible by ultrasound. Normally they ask you to wait mainly for that purpose, so they can kind of get a general idea of how far along you are since you had a regular cycle. The ultrasound will be close enough, it might be behind a week or so but it will all change once you become farther along.     And don't worry, it's OKAY to get pregnant after a miscarriage without having a period, loads of women do it every day and still go on to carry healthy full term babies.     Lots of luck to you and congradulations!

So cute though, I think eventually he will like them??  :)|`|OHq5gSjJaa	My daughter absolutely fought and hated anything pureed.  She would scream and cry and bat the spoon away and purse her lips.

I guess he's done with baby foods.
k1cDEnLPaa	I had that too. Most likely it is either Braxton Hicks or your uterus stretching (round ligament pain). If they are very sharp and last a long time, you start to bleed and/or the baby's movement decreases a lot, call your doctor right away. Also, for peace of mind, you could always call your doctor to be sure...|`|8mLJJVGhaa	It could be a few things, your ligaments stretching to get ready for birth,    Braxton Hicks (practice contractions)   Trapped wind (gave me hell in all three pregnancy's - thought I was going to die!! lol)     Try a warm (not too hot) hot water bottle, or have you got a gym / birthing ball? If so, sit on it, roll your hips a bit, and bounce a bit, that eased most of my pains!
E2UXN7J1aa	Then stick around! Obviously since you have been through the newborn stage with your child you can help a lot of other people with questions.

GZRHJBT7aa	Well your first son has a nature name. It means sea or ocean.

2pxiK9waaa	She's just fine and it did not harm her. The nurse told you what to give her, and it's fine! It just may be different with each illness your child gets, also. <br>  <br>  I know I take higher doses of Tylenol depending on the problem--if it's a headache I give myself two Tylenols, but when I have a migraine, I go for two Aleves per my doctor's recommendation. <br>  <br>  With Roseola, a fever is nearly guaranteed and it can get really high really quickly. The higher and quicker the fever goes in an infant, the higher the likelihood your baby will have a febrile seizure. Therefore, the nurse at the hospital prevented your daughter from seizing. For that illness on that day, it was the correct dosage for your child.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Pharmaceutical companies lower doasages to prevent liability. So when you have a serious illness like your daughter did, it is perfectly normal for a DR to tell you a bigger amount then what is on the bottle because in reality, it wont hurt her and continuing to do so wont hurt her also. She is ok, I promise you!!|`|AA10624857	Several years ago we had to take our daughter to ER for a high fever (104.8) that was causing agitation, hallucination, and irritability.  After a few hours of alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen plus running tests, her fever came down and she began to feel better.  They never did find out what caused the fever, but the ER doctor gave us a sheet with the Professional Dosage Schedule for both ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  For the children's Tylenol, the dosage for ages 4-11 months in children who are 12-17 pounds is 0.8 ml.  For 12-23 months with a weight of 18-23 pounds the dosage is 1.2 ml or 1 1/2 droppers full.  The dosages can be administered 4-5 times daily not to exceed 5 doses in 24 hours.  I think if your daughter was getting 2 droppers but you gave it to her less than 4 times per day than she wasn't in danger of an overdose.  It is not unlike how my doctor has me take over the counter ibuprofen.  The bottle says 2 tablets every 4-6 hours not to exceed 6 tablets in 24 hours, but she has me use 4 tablets every 8 hours in place of prescription 800mg motrin since we don't have prescription coverage.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i dont think you harmed her bc it would probably be obvious by now. i am no expert of curse on tylenol overdoes or even giving the right amount (which is why i only gave it to my baby once, im just too chicken) but tylenol overdose/damage shows up within 2 WEEKS of over-dosage. sometimes it is cumulative but believe me, your daughter would be really sick by now if you had harmed her---there's actually a margin of error too they may tell you to give the lowest amount to just be extra safe.<br>  also, on the back it says the amount for weight, not necessarily age. maybe one nurse went by your daughter's weight, and the other by her age. either way, i think she's okay, but of course ask her pediatrician tommorow.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	It's fine, i'm sure it didn't effect your daughter at all. Just call her pediatrician and ask tomorrow, but honestly i wouldn't be worried at all. It's just Tylenol, and it's not like you did it numerous times everyday for weeks.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	my son was taking 1 dropper and full and a half of another at 6 months, hes now 9 months and still give him that much he was only about 16 lbs. i dont think you did any harm|`|whROrAhFaa	If she hasn't shown any problems it probably has not had any adverse effects.  Tylenol can be harmful to the kidneys though so it probably wouldn't hurt to ask about them.  If she is having normal urination thats a good sign that her kidneys are functioning properly.  If u ask your ped should be able to give you a list of the proper doses for all ages and weights.  If possible you should dose by weight not age and you'll be happy to know that the proper weight for 2 droppers (1.6ml) is 24-35lbs so your little one isn't far off =) I will post the weight age and dose list that I have and you might want to keep a copy of this for your own peace of mind and know...Hope I've been helpful.

The droppers are only 80 mgs, so twice is 160 mg, so that's only an extra 10mgs each dose, not really that much.  In an emergency room they dose 20mg per kg, so it would have been 200 mgs for a high fever.  Your little girl is fine!

PFO1jxZGaa	My daughter had it too and her dr prescribed a lotion called therma smooth etc and it helped at first but then it stopped and she got prescribed another creme which took care of it. So go to your dr and she will give you stuff to help it.   Also once she cleared out her skin was still extremely dry so now I have to rub vaseline on her after bath to keep her skin smooth.   I also realized that tomato and other red foods make it worse and sometimes it can be that they are allergic to milk so just see if it gets worse after they eat something ( if thet are eating yet)   and dont use harsh soaps to wash them.

5N3odm3Qaa	Post-partum depression is largely due to a natural and uncontrollable drop in hormone levels in the 24 hours or so following birth. Your present anxiety is subject to too many variables to determine whether or not it will be an issue after you conceive, go through the pregnancy, and finally give birth. However, anxiety will not CAUSE post-partum depression. Those are two separate issues.    With two problem-free births, you're HIGHLY unlikely (dare I say guaranteed not?) to experience post-partum depression following the third. Depression has genetic components and post-partum depression is essentially just luck of the draw. About 13% of women experience it but you've had two problem-free births so, like I said, you're an extremely unlikely candidate.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	there is no way to predict it, but if u do, when u realize it isn't the 'baby blues'; or if u start having thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself or anyone else, get help right away and u should be fine....depression can set in at any time, on anyone...it is a chemical imbalance...if they prescribe u meds, TAKE THEM; u need to be at ur best for ur babies and there is no shame in depression....it isnt something u can control, it is like any other illness....anxiety itself can be very difficult, have you talked to ur doc about that? there are meds that can help control it, but if i am reading correctly and you did have thoughts of hurting someone, that is more than anxiety....if u were just scared that you would then it sounds more like anxiety--there is no need to suffer when help is out there...|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It varies, you could still get it with the third even though you didnt with the first two because each pregnancy is different. Just watch for the signs and make sure you tell your doctor everything that is going on with you, even from the beginning tell your doctor you are worried about post partum.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Mostly likely you wont.

tapFZBowaa	I have a 17 year old and a 5 month old.  It is wonderful and exhausting all at the same time.  Your kids are going to be old enough to understand what is going on--that will be great.  I could not ask for a better set up for my family but in the same turn this is how I was brought up as well.....I have a brother that is 12 years older than me, and another 7 years older than me.  As the youngest, I can tell you they hung the moon.  My oldest brother used to bring me on dates and was like another parent to me, and I see that repeating itself with my daughter and son.  She is like a little mom, and she understands all the care a baby really takes (good reality lesson!)  At 26 I would not hesitate in the least to have another!  In fact, I would like to have two more!  Good luck!|`|FplTPoAyaa	Its wonderful ! I have 2 stepchildren (17 and 12) and a daughter (11).  Our baby just turned a year old, and we are enjoying every minute.  Our older children adore her.  They are such a big help to us.  They are always wanting to help dress her, give her a bath, rock her to sleep, etc.  They love playing with her, and my husband and I love it.  I feel like I am much more patient now than I was 11 years ago, and I also feel much more confident as a mother.  I enjoy every little moment with her, and I savor it.  I had my baby when I was 36 years old, and I had no problems.  Good luck !|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	My children are all two years apart, so I can't really help.

And now they're 24 ad 16.      I'm sure it presents it's own problems though. I'm a nursing student right now and I have a 4yr old, 2yr old and 2 week old.

The experience is much different because everything has changed from the way you give birth to what and when to feed them.

Only thing change is the materials to raising a baby but everything is still the same|`|Ks7lENScaa	I am 34 years old and I have a 14 year old daughter.  I also have a 3 month old son.  It was just me and my daughter for the longest time.  The new baby has brought nothing but joy and made us all closer.  For myself I don't see it as starting over.  Most of the stuff I am going through with my son I don't even remember with my daughter.  Your kids are still kind of young.  They aren't teenagers yet.  The only thing is I wish I had my son years ago so they could have grown up together.  But it just didn't happen that way.  I say if you want more children have at least two.  So you will have your last two growing up together like your first two.
o9Xh4ix1aa	Try not to be so hard on yourself.  You probably can increase your supply.  It sounds like the reason you're getting low is because you are pumping instead of directly breastfeeding.  For some reason, the baby stimulates you better- promoting your body to make more milk.  Try substituting some of the pumping with nursing and you may see an increase.  Also, it sounds like you may be decreasing the frequency that you are pumping.  I was always told and found that the more you nurse the more you make--if you can't or don't want to--then the more you pump the more you should make (although it won't be quite as much as nursing--but A LOT of people solely pump and are able to feed their infants only breastmilk).  You should try to pump around every 2-3 hours and if you can, drag yourself up once during the middle of the night (it hurts but it really does help).  Other factors such as diet and stress can impact your supply.  Make sure you are eating enough calories (about 400-600 more than you would normally eat) and make sure you are finding healthy ways to relieve your stress.  Walking outside always does it for me.  Some people find that taking supplements or teas such as fenugreek and mother's milk help increase production--personally I never noticed a difference.    Good Luck!|`|sY3EVjXnaa	you are less of a mother|`|IUEZzmfyaa	First of all I'm not a doctor and second I'm a male. If you want to continue, you might want to hear what I have to say. If you are a first time mother and your intention was to breast feed your child, you would have looked into that prior to giving birth. If not, you should do a lot of research now.   Feeding your child with your own breast milk has so many advantages for both of you, and few disadvantages. It brings you closer to your child by bonding in a way that is like no other, and it's really advantageous for that child in that it gets the proper nutrients from you as well as a host of agents that you already have that reduces the risk of disease in that child. There are many other reasons that you can see on-line as well as through your pediatrician. Make sure that you see that doctor on a regular basis to ensure that your child has the best of care.|`|Fei8s7vdaa	We all produce milk at a different rate.  Some of us only produce for a month or so before our bodies just won't produce anymore.  There isn't anything wrong with you, this has just happened to my friend.      You're not less of a mother, you fed that baby in the womb and for a while on the outside!  It may be time to just talk to your doctor and make the switch to formula to keep your baby fed.  Don't feel bad!|`|qKDOpbc8aa	YOUR BABY IS MUCH BETTER AT GETTING MILK OUTTHAN A PUMP ALTHOUGH SOME WOMAN CAN PUMP A FULL YEAR FOR A BABY OTHERS CAN BARELY PUMP AT ALL, MY THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT BABY IS REQURING MORE & YOUR NOT PUMPING ENOUGH TIMES A DAY I WOULD INCREASE FLUIDS GET SOME FENUGREEK & BLESSED THISTLE TO HELP INCREASE & TRY TO PUMP AT LEAST EVERY 3HRS. GOOD LUCK MAMA|`|C6wO9ixpaa	I think the biggest thing to consider with the situation of pumping instead of feeding from the breast is that nothing can empty your breast as well as your baby. Since your pump doesn't empty as much, your breast tells your brain that you don't need to make as much next time. It may continue to produce less and less. Production is decreased when demand is decreased. You can try to pump more often, or try to get your baby to latch back on and nurse at least part of the time from your breast.|`|5LxJNxWwaa	dont fret your doing fine. when your milk comes in it is totally normal to get tons of milk but as time goes on baby regulates it. your body only produces as much as baby is demanding. so maybe your lil one isnt eating as much. as long as he/she is gaining anywhere from a half ounce to an ounce a day your doing great. plus baby is way more efficient at getting milk out than ANY pump. when i pumped the first time just to help with engorgment i got like 8 oz and even if i were to try now i barely get 2 to 3 ounces. but my little girl is definitly getting enough shes gained 2 oz a day since she was born. dont worry momma your doing great!
AA11327039	With my first everyone wanted to be in the room with me and I kept saying that I wanted nobody but my husband.  I didn't even want my mom in the room.  Anyway, while I was laboring (24 hours), everyone was in the room.  Around 2am, everyone left to go get a snack and smoke break (thank God half of them smoked and the other half wanted to get some fresh air) while the nurse checked me.  Anyway as soon as they left for a few minutes I started throwing up and feeling really funny.  The nurse came and checked me again (less than 5 minutes later) and she said that I went from about a 3 to a 10 CM dilated.     The point of my story is that if your body is stressed by the presence of others it might not labor properly.    I think I went into labor because they were all gone and my body relaxed a bit more.    Tell the hospital staff to kick everyone out except for the dad.|`|MtC3CWZraa	What's the worry?    "Mary, I'm really glad you're excited about this baby, but I'm most comfortable with only Bob in the room with me. You're more than welcome to visit before and after delivery though."

Have you tried alcohol? It's good that you don't want to get drunk, but swearing off all alcohol for eternity if you've never even tried it seems a bit silly and extreme. A glass of wine on special occasion won't hurt you. But it's a choice, you drink alcohol or you don't. It's entirely your choice and no one else should be allowed to influence it.    And on a side not... if your "friends" are drinking and telling you it's weird you don't want to, you have a lot more to worry about than what they think.|`|dgM66nRBaa	its not weird...

This is usually true - it loosens people up and makes them more carefree about what they're doing (i.e. sleeping with someone they've never met) and it generally makes people more happy for the while. If you haven't tried alcohol yet (properly) then there isn't really any point in never trying it; its always good to experience new things and work it out for yourself.|`|xRcqusUaaa	no its not weird its just that you have made up your mind that your not going to drink that does not mean your weird....and beside your to young to drink anyways|`|AA11327039	There was a time when I would attend parties and not drink.

My friends don't think its weird, they will call me uptight and tell me to cut loose, but they recognize that I am making smart decisions and won't end up doing random **** I will regret.     Maybe you can explain to your friends why you won't drink- just tell them what you told us. They might not think its so weird then.|`|hswTS1jVaa	It's not weird at all, it's a very good idea actually.|`|c9cEZGfraa	i think its a good idea. you're not wierd.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I don't think its weird. Making a definite decision while still so young is kinda different because as your growing up you'll find yourself in different situations that present you with alcohol-weddings, bridal showers, birthday parties, anniversaries its good that you don't want to drink now but you don't always have to drink to get drunk. You don't have to have a reason just tell your friends you don't want to drink and leave it at that they'll understand and respect your decision. -|`|MCeh0uIaaa	It's not wierd at all. In fact, you may just be the smartest 15 year old girl out there! Alcohol is a terrible thing and although you may change your mind when you get older it is a good idea to stay away from it. You are more likely to abuse alcohol later on in lifeif you start in your teen years. Just remember that if you ever to go out and drink have someone with you that won't be drinking and always remember that no matter how drunk you are your parents would much rather come pick you up than have you trying to drive home in such a situation. : ) good luck and although you don't know me, I'm proud of you.
b561f8ea3b393985421f3fa7b31d8f64aa	I would suggest setting up play dates and talking to her about being a good host and sharing her things, etc.  Than reciprocate by having her go over to a play date and talk to her about being a good guest and respecting other people.  Granted, she is only two, but positive reinforcement is the key.  Reward her for being nice and respectful - Try using a sticker chart where she gets stickers for being good.  If she fills the sticker chart, she gets a reward!  It words well for younger kids.|`|68e7a125a67f127a280f01fc8dbf5901aa	Children this age don't have real 'friendships' with other children.  They often play around, but not with, other children.  It is perfectly normal for her developmental stage.  Instead of spanking her and sending her off by herself, get down with her and model good behavior.  Show her how to play with other kids.  Offer her suggestions before there is a problem.  Go to your library and get a parenting book specifically for her age.  It will have lots of good advice and let you know what to expect.|`|PQxXh4Q7aa	I'm guessing, she's an only child?  She's only 2 and if she doesn't have any siblings at home to share with and learn from then she doesn't know she's doing anything wrong. No point in punishing when this is otherwise normal behavior for her.  When she acts like this just remove her from the situation and tell her not to be bossy and share.  Then give her something else.|`|qBvHdZf2aa	she needs to know to take u serious when ur punishing her for treating others badly...so if u send her to her room or give her a lil spanking and then after her punishment act like nothing happened or everything is ok n she continues w/whatever she was doing, then that gives her the idea that if the punishment isnt so bad then she might as well take the risk...it takes awhile for lil kids to completely get the concept of right and wrong...at her age its all about pleasing the parents...treating others kindly is something that she will b more capable of when she gets to that age of starting school cuz then shes forced to work w/others kindly n respectfully... all u can do now is keep punishing her BUT at the same time after her punishment is over u should explain to her that she not only has to respect n b kind to u n her dad but also others because it reflects u 2 as parents...|`|G2auAv1Saa	Do you send her to her room where she has toys?   That sounds like a pretty nice little punishment for a kid. Playing sounds more fun than following rules and being around adults.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Every time she does that send her to the naughty spot, [a rug, mat etc]. When my daughter is being sassy then i do that with her! My son sometimes needs to go there to hes 2.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	many kids r  like that|`|tCU7trAKaa	she is years old she wants mommy and daddy its a phase she will get over it...
1z3C0R2Vaa	It happen to me once but and when i did the ultrasound i was nor pregnant until this day doc cannot tell me what cause it to positive and i am not pregnant.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It's so nice to see a "Am I pregnant or what?" question with some real reasoning behind it! Implantation bleeding is very common in pregnancy. It could even be a full blown period depending how late in your cycle you got pregnant. There could be a few different things going on. 2 positive pregnancy tests, you definitely are pregnant! The digital ones are even more accurate from what I hear. Go see the doc and find out what's up. Congratulations!|`|ly59dQ3gaa	It could be as simple as implantation bleeding, but that usually isn't heavy enough to be mistaken for a period.  I don't want to freak you out, but let me tell you about my first pregnancy.  It started just like yours, with the positive HPT.  A few days later (4 days after I should have started my period) I started bleeding.  It turned out that it was, in fact, a delayed period.  Not necessarily a miscarriage, but a period that was late b/c I had just had a chemical pregnancy.  We fertilized an egg, but it failed to implant.  I'm not saying this is what is happening to you, but it's a possiblity.  you need to get to an OB ASAP.    Good luck!    PS:  we conceived a successful pregnancy one month later.  I gave birth to my daughter 5/17/08.  things have a way of working out for the best!|`|J2glFOkhaa	I'm not sure, it could be implantation bleeding. I'd say schedule an appointment with your doctor.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	You probably should go to your doctor, you could be having a miscarriage. It also depends on how heavy you are bleeding too. I had a little spotting at 4-6 weeks, went to the ER at the first signs, was told my cervix was still open, was put on bed rest. Finally about a week and a half later, went to me OB/GYN and was told my cervix  was closed!!! I am now 22 weeks, so I think you should take some kind of action and pretty fast, because if you are not miscarrying you want to find out what is wrong!!! Good luck!|`|bTzw1JDwaa	it is implantation bleeding. It can happen when the baby is implanted into your uterus. It is light and short only last a very short while. You are pregnant though, CONGRADULATIONS!|`|NMzlbWt8aa	This could be one of a few things. Depending on how far along you are it may be implantation bleeding. But this could also be something else.  You need to see a OBGYN as soon as possible.|`|XCrtAUTpaa	my sister did that with her first baby but i would go to the Dr.|`|WG941bbDaa	You can sometimes have periods the first couple months of your pregnancy.  It's very rare for there to be a false positive.  False negatives do happen.  I think you are prob. pregnant.  Just contact your doc. and let him/her know you need to come in for a pregnancy test.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	The pains are probably stretching of your muscles since baby is still growing and is needing more and more room. As far as the baby moving as long as the baby is moving it is ok, try doing kick counts which is where you pick an hour through the day and relax and count how many times you feel the baby you should feel it 10 times in an hour but if you try it once and dont feel that many dont freak out it may just be sleeping wait a while and try again. If your doctor isnt concerned then I would say everything is ok. I went through a couple weeks of not feeling a whole lot of movement and now at 34 weeks he is killing me with his movements, it is like he never stops and it hurts.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeha I had the same thing at 30 weeks, now 7 weeks later I still get the sharp pains form time to time.  The baby is sitting on a nerve and/or its your body getting ready for the big day (which could be weeks away still)|`|1ezYfkX7aa	The sharp pains could be your babies feet or arms digging in your sides, i am 29wks and get that all the time. Sinse your almost there the baby doesnt have as much room as before to move like it did before...as long as hes moving throughout the day i wouldnt worry. My baby only moves alot when i am laying down on my side...she goes crazy lol....if your concerned though just call your doctor, it wont hurt and nothing you ask he hasnt heard before. Goodluck =)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Its probably gas, you still get gas while pregnant.|`|MDSoBHeXaa	?|`|HbmHRiwLaa	well when i was pregnant i got sharp pains due to my stomach muscles stretching..    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFFYIdslQ...|`|FsFUo4VJaa	They could be braction hicks contractions fake ones but I would call the doctor.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	go to the hospital,if baby has not moved (they all have a routine) to make sure its ok. how far apart are the sharp pains? is the pain coming from the lower back to the front part of your belly?|`|W492U39Iaa	My baby wasn't as active around the same time either.  As long as your doctors say that you're okay and the ultrasound shows everything is normal then don't worry...your baby will be kicking up a storm soon enough!    Congratulations and take care!|`|7ouqu8f4aa	I started getting Braxton Hicks around 28 weeks, and my son was born at 37 weeks. They made me completely freak out thinking something was wrong with me or the baby, and I called my doctor and he told me that the sharp pains I were having were completely normal.  Here's a link for you to look into, and if you still can't be sure what the pains are coming from I suggest you call your doctor. After all, if something is wrong, he can help you figure it and fix the problem.    http://www.babycenter.com/0_braxton-hick...|`|qImMwhUHaa	Babies move differently when they get bigger so it feels different. They used to kick and wiggle and squirm and now that he/she is bigger they mostly just squirm around because they don't have room to kick anymore. As long as you feel the baby moving every 3-4 hours then everything should be fine. I'm around 31-32 weeks too and I get those sharp pains too. It can either be stretching of your muscles to allow room for baby or a push by the baby that was a little to hard or the baby could be pushing on your cervix, that really hurts. Hope this puts your mind at ease. I know right now you're probably worrying about every little thing so just try to think positive thoughts and get everything ready for baby.
IkuZj0Lbaa	First off, calm down. Premies are surviving more and more now adays. Stressing out won't help you. They can give you drugs to stop/delay the labor, but it all depends if the baby is being distressed. Get to the hospital as soon as you can.|`|5l5eCRdOaa	There are A LOT of random pains that go along with being prego!  Go to the dr and see FOR SURE what is going on...that is a life inside you...a part of you...congrats!!|`|cQ0fEQBhaa	Well, thtey might be able to do something to stop bub from coming. It's very bad for the baby to be born so early as they do not start developing lungs until week 23. That's why they are viable between the 24th week and on. I'm so sorry to hear about this, but surely they can't do something to stop labor if your water hasn't broken.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	thats no excuse, use spell check lol    wait and see what they say|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	I think her spelling is the last thing on her f'ing mind if she is worried she is having a miscarriage. Honestly, I really can't believe how petty some women are on here.    Good Luck lovely, hopefully your baby will be ok.     XXX|`|lGKq9NXbaa	It sounds like the beginning of a miscarriage ,go to the hospital immediately. They probably will be able to stop it, if you deliver this early in the pregnancy i'm not sure the baby will make it. Please get yourself to a hospital.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	jesus...use spell check much?? Anyhow why would any doctor tell you your baby can come premature without you even being in a hospital and evaluated...you seem like a troll!!|`|cfdooGylaa	Not trying to be rude here but you seriously need to brush up your spelling. Its so hard to read your question. If the baby could be premature then you need to go to labor and delivery so they can try to treat you.|`|MqFeJiukaa	They will put you on a monitor to see if you are having contractions, if you are then they will give you meds to stop the contractions.|`|R7mnEUOZaa	Stop crying and try to relax. There are drugs you can be given to stop the labour. Being in high state of nerves won't help' I know its easy to say but you do need to calm down to give the baby the best possible chance.  Hope all goes ok.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	21 weeks would be very, very early to give birth.  I hope you are OK.
3F8f1SoQaa	It is a problem, but there is all kinds of help available if you know where to look for it. Here is the US they have a federal program called early intervention that is designed for children under the age of three with developmental delays. My son was very late at talking too. He was 18 months old and only saying about 10 words...but at 2 years old he was STILL saying the same 10 words. The poor baby was so frustrated that he could not communicate his feelings to us, he had horrible tantrums for more than 6 months. At 2 years old my doctor ignored my concerns, and I knew as a mother that something was not right. That same day I found out about early intervention. he had an intial screening with an intervention specialist, then saw a nurse and social worker. They determined that nothing in his home environment was causing his delay, so they sent him to a speech therapist. She diagnosed him with verbal apraxia and started seeing him for 30 minutes 2x per week. I did not have to pay for ANYTHING. within a few months he had made great progress...not only was he now saying 50+ words, but he had 50+ signs, and was combining words into small sentences. About 7 months later he barely made the cut for special needs preschool ( also free for him). Now at 3 years old he is speaking age appropriately with articulation errors.    I would let her know that there is help available for him. Maybe you can give the therapists permission to come treat him at your house... make sure to let her know that just because he has a communication delay DOES NOT mean that he is not smart. My son is so smart it is not funny. He is actually ahead of some of the "typical peer models" in his preschool class! He can use the Tv remote, my computer, count, knows his ABCs and all kinds of things.    ETA: it may be more than just an expressive delay he has...the blank stare you get sometimes could be a receptive speech issue too. Early intervention can sort this all out...it will be very good for him :)|`|NKmmqjWFaa	there's nothing wrong with him!!!! he just doesnt want to talk give him a break he doesn't have a mental problem because he doesnt want to talk|`|7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	The only way to be sure is going to the doctor and getting him checked. I had a nephew who was the same way he had to take speech therapy he was 4 years old and couldn't say a lot. He knew some words but you couldn't understand what he was saying.. My little cousin was a very quiet baby she knew how to speak but refused to. My husband was the same way he knew how to speak he just didn't want to.|`|zbqXWI3Haa	He's not slow he just is not wanting to talk right now. Sometimes this could be a sign of abuse. Give him time and maybe he will talk. He's only one and some people take longer..|`|Ua9CZtINaa	Nope, nothing is wrong with him. He is just taking in all the words that you or his parents say to him. To help him adapt more you should explain things. Say his name is Christopher: Hey Christopher, look what I got you. I'm making some delicious milk that you'd like to drink, say thank you.  Things like that, the little things will help. Keep it up and Good Luck!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	My first boy didnt really speak much until 18 mos and at 2 years he only had about 40 words. He was fine and now at 6 you cant get him to shut it :)   My 3 year old however only had about 6 words at age of 2 and he has gone thru almost a year of speech therapy and now is almost caught up to his age level.   My daughter at 18 mos has about 20 words.   All you can do is to observe him and if his vocabulary dont seem to be increasing by the time he is two she might want to get him evaluated for need of speach therapy because it is better to get some help early than to wait until they are ready to go to school etc.   Some kids are just slower and like to take their time some nee little extra encouragement and help|`|tmh42R6Caa	I think he's fine.  My son is approaching 17 months now and he doesn't say a ton.  He says mama, dada, cracker, wawa, dog, hot, but not much more.  He might be behind the curve, but I don't think there's anything wrong with him.  I know kids who barely spoke until after they were 2.  When he turns 2 and still isn't talking, then I would look into it.|`|SOt3a4xYaa	Get the kid checked out by a doctor as a precautionary measure. It sounds like he could have a developmental disorder- it's probably nothing serious. It could jsut be ADD.|`|145RUNQHaa	You are right to be concerned no matter what anyone else says.my children at that age were saying similar things to yours and they would understand if i asked them something.i don t like the sound of it when you said you get a blank stare.and the crying for no apparent reason could be anything toddlers get upset about the strangest things and he could just have a speech delay.but when someone mentioned it was a possible sign of abuse i did some research.they are right the random tantrums and lack of communication are signs i m very sorry if i ve got this wrong but if you think there is a remote possibilty of this please keep an extremley close eye on him and act on any suspicions.|`|ozANMyXCaa	You know does he have older siblings by chance, if so, he may not talk because he has no need, the older kids answer for him, say, but if not, i think i would take him for a preschool evaluation, or just go to google and google the question, and it should give u several options, and u maybe could find out the possibilities, hope this some help, if not let me know and i will try to help u find the answer, ok?    From Granny from alaska.|`|grKtTRYtaa	It is a concern.  Boys are slower.    If he were mine, I would make an appointment with Easter Seals or March of Dimes.  It is free.    They also might have insurance that will pay.  Go ahead.  If all goes well, they will ease your concerns.  If not, the sooner he gets help, the better.   It'a a win-win.|`|AA11327039	Tell them to contact First Steps or their local school district to have the Parent Educator come by the house and do a screening.    If he qualifies for speech therapy they will send someone to the house for FREE (First Steps actually has a sliding scale of fees, but most families qualify for free services)|`|dhXCEumpaa	Now there might not be any physical or mental problems with him. Children at that age are emotionally attached to their parents and prefer to not interact with others that they don't know all to well. How long have you been babysitting the child. For some toddlers, it is very easy for them to bond with others, for some other toddlers, it is hard and they see a world of strangers not knowing what to do. I don't believe that you are doing anything wrong. There might be a bully at his school (highly unlikely but possible) that might be affecting his attitude. I also have times where I burst out in tears and others think it is just out of the blue. I have issues where I think about incredibly sad things. He might be thinking about various nightmares and night terrors. And yes, girls tend to develop faster than boys. To him, you might be a scary stranger (no offense) and he might be afraid to bond with you. a blank stare could mean that he is not paying attention or he is afraid to answer for some reason. I'm not sure if it will help but try asking people that know him well about how he acts toward others, particularly how he acts toward strangers. I can't give you much more help but I hope this helps. I could have left something out but most of this I have seen or experienced.|`|HF97Rs9qaa	well at almost 2 years old it is weird for him to not be taking. All the kids in my family started saying small words at the age of 12 months then small sentances by the age of 2 and by 2 and a half you could hold conversations with them.    It is true some children develop at a different rate but by almost 2 years old he should at least be saying something more than mama.    If it were me I would be worried and take him to therapists and the Dr. and get a medical and professional opinion. That is the only way to have real insight to it... not just hmmm maybe boys are just slower and we will wait till he is 3 and not talking.    He could be just fine but he could also have a problem and it is better for him to get treatment sooner than later if he does have a problem. If I were the parnets I would have taken him to a specialist already.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	All babies are different.  I don't feel like there is anything you or the boy's mother should be worried about.  On that note, I do have a suggestion:    My cousin's son doesn't talk much and my mom told my cousin that when her brother was younger, he didn't talk  because he was "tongue-tied".  When my cousin looked at her son's mouth, she saw that he is "tongue-tied" as well.
oUFZPljBaa	Well we need more details because it all depends on when was the last time you had sex|`|s56Hv7BSaa	maybe implantation bleeding, it usually happens a few days before your period is due and it only there when you wipe.|`|JcVHhFZbaa	well it depends if u have ahd sex... if you have and you weren't protected then you should go and buy a test... I had the same problem and iv'e had sex but i wasn't so thats good. but i would go and buy a test to see! Good Luck|`|R7U1sDd1aa	That could very well be "implantation bleeding", or you just being a little irregular. I don't know how regular you usually are, so just a guess. Me and my husband were trying to get pregnant, and on the third month, my period never came. I took some at home pregnancy tests that were of course negative, because it was the day that I was supposed to start, so when I got to work (I'm an LPN at a doctor's office), I had another nurse draw my blood to get an HCG level done, and it came back elevated, which in most cases means you're pregnant! It's the best way to tell you, other than an ultrasound, esp. if you're impatient like me. Good luck! Hope this helped you.
9c53EJskaa	Sounds like it could be possible! Either go and get another test- This time get a digital. They cost a little bit more but they result is a lot more definate- they say if your pregnant or not pregnant. Or go to the docters and ask for a test. They can give you a blood test to see if you are or not and then you'll have a definate answer!    Goodluck and heres hoping you are!!|`|GcJszsMnaa	You could be.. since you get usually reg...AF's so GOOD luck hun!!! Congregates if you are....!|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	At about 2 weeks late, you should have had a positive test.

I have never seen walmart cheaper than target for Luvs, Huggies or Pampers.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If you check the sale ads you will always find some store with cheap diapers.

I don't know where your from or how much they are where your at though but when i went shopping at baby's-us before i had my daughter i got 2 boxes of diapers for 20 some dollars and some baby wipes for $2-$3 and they were on sale. I don't know what they are now but i think its usually cheaper at wal-mart cause diapers aren't on sale forever.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	Only by a dollar Wal- Mart would be cheaper.  I would subscribe to Pampers.com for free sample and coupons. They also has a reward program. Every time (Pampers, doesnt matter where you buy them) you buy a pack of diapers you get code you (on inside of the diaper bag) type it in on the website after you sign in on Pampers (create an account) and get a point after you get more points you can exchange the points for books and toys off the website.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Well there isn't a Wal Mart around where I live, so we buy diapers at Target. And I know they're much cheaper at Target then at Babies R Us. Diapers.com usually has some good deals if you buy a few boxes at a time (free shipping over $50, etc.). Don't buy at Walgreens or another pharmacy-Diapers are always more expensive there, with the exception of the occasional sale.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	The nearest babies R us is 2 hrs away, But at our walmart. Pampers for a package is 10.97 and for a box is 19 to 21 bucks a box. Depending on size, but our walmart doesnt have boxes bigger than 104 or more in a box.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	walmart and target are about the same price. Sam's club you can get like 230 for 35 dollars.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	Everything is less expensive at Wal-Mart.  :o)|`|irHF6CBPaa	Were I an it is always cheaper at wal mart|`|smcWIZxPaa	its hard to say.  At Walmart they don't have the jumbo size boxes.  At babies r us they have 200+ diapers in a box and the max is about 100 at walmart.  Here's what I've discovered.  I use pampers for my son. I either go to Walmart and buy the 100pack for $21 or I go to babies r us and get the 200+ pack for $41.   Either way it really is about the same price.  It just depends on how often you want to go.  I would say go to babies r us and get the bigger pack.  It will save you time and babies r us has coupons a lot for $5 off jumbo boxes of diapers.  I've never seen a coupon for diapers at walmart.  That's just my advice.  Hope it helps you out!|`|GHrOk5Ngaa	if your trying to save money i would recommend going to the pampers website (and any other baby item website) and sign up for their clubs. They send you all kind of freebies and and coupons. I would get almost monthy coupons and checks for diapers and formula.|`|2c10ae9d03edf5d663e295c5fc61a2caaa	yes and coupons help i should know this i have 5month old twins|`|Z5s5DV6haa	you should mke youre own diapers! i use newspaper and safty pins, theyre almost free!
n6XYYyoLaa	your mother sounds very very manipulative...do u live with her? if so, can you move? it is not her business who u are talking to, or when you do it...i would ignore her when she tries to start it...if she asks a question that is none of her business...i would answer with a question like 'why do you need to know?' or 'why would YOU ask ME something like that?' beyond that i wouldn't engage her; let her talk to herself.....after she realizes she isn't going to get a response, she will eventually stop, but you have to be strong, bc she will pull out every trick in the book to try to get a response....and remember when you are older and your child is older how this feels and make sure that you don't accidentally do the same thing to your child....sucks, but nothing lasts forever|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	your mom does not sound very supportive of u at all <br>  that is insane <br>  im sorry this happened to u <br>  i dont no tell her to stop doing that or she will put her relanship with her grand son in jepordary|`|JP2h62qiaa	Okay honey, Calm down and breath. Your mom has some serious problems. Why cant you talk to your baby's father? That is NONE of her Business. She can't tell you who you can and can't talk to. I don't know your story but I would sit your mom down and tell her that she is just causing un needed problems for you. I am so sorry she is making you feel this way. Seriously tell her you will leave and go stay with the baby's other grand parents if this is how she will treat you. Good luck.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You need to confront your mother about this, and tell her how it is making you feel. Tell her that if she wants to know things that you will not lie to her and you are more than capable of telling her the truth.|`|EMKuBql8aa	What your mom is doing is 110% wrong wrong wrong. She sounds like a toxic, vile person. I suggest you move out ASAP for you and your babies safety and sanity. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Next time she threatens to call ANYONE on you, you just tell her that you're a big girl, this baby is YOURS, NOT hers, and that she needs to mind her own business. Tell her that if she EVER threatens to call DCF on you that you'll be calling the cops on her. Sounds to me like your mother is a possessive, controlling B***H! It also sounds like she still has some control over you. Don't let her scare you or intimidate you. When she says people are coming to get your son, just tell her you're leaving. I have known too many controlling moms in my day, and when you leave, they'll straighten out just to get you back. But I'm afraid it'll be a silly game of cat and mouse with your mom for the rest of your life, or until you can stand up to her and STAY STANDING! Don't let her back you into a corner! You're her daughter, not her puppet. And when she threatens you or manipulates you, just remind her that you have the power to not let her see her grandson... EVER AGAIN! It's YOUR choice, and your power... NOT hers! Believe in yourself! God bless you!|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Wow, I would just stop answering her. If she is going to be crazy like that then she doesn't deserve the time of day, let alone anything about your personal life like that. Just ignore her when she gets like that. She can't start a fight if you don't let her get to you. Just leave or hang up the phone or whatever.<br>  <br>  I suggest getting away from her asap. And tell her if she doesn't stop that kind of thing then you can't be around her after you are in your own place.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Oh my I am so sorry. You have really done nothing wrong, and I cannot imagine how hard it must be to be a single teen mom. You love your baby and you're a good mom, and if anyone came to investigate you they would see that. Don't get down, it will turn out OK in the end!!|`|aIDg79cuaa	I would not stay with her!  She is being ridiculous and terribly rude! If she can't "find out the truth" without being nice about it, then i would leave or just ignore until i get an apology!|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	I don't know. All I can say is you are a mother now. How can you possibly raise your child with dignity when she is still trying to control you? It's time for you to grow up (not that you are doing anything wrong) and make your own decisions based on what's best for you and your child, regardless of what she says. Instead of breaking down, act like a woman and let her know these things. It might get you further in the long run.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Jesus your mom is emotionally and verbally abusing you! this is wrong! Do you live with her?? This is not a very good environment for you or your child. Your mother has mental issues, and I'm not saying that to be mean! Somethings just wrong with her. She cares about you, obviously but she doesn't have a handle on things. Abuse comes in all forms from all sort of people, and even if she's your mom it's wrong and can leave life long scars and trauma. Emotional and mental and verbal abuse can be worse than physical. You need to get away from her and ask her if she would be interested in seeing a therapist. How old are you? If you ever need to talk You can email me chele61636@gmail.com THis is sooo wrong and I"m so sorry she is doing this to you. She's sick.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Wow! This is a horrible thing your Mother is putting you through, and this is a horrible situation! Im so sorry that you are being put through this. <br>  <br>  What business is it of your Mothers anyways if you are talking to the Baby's father? How does it concern her in any way? Thats your business, and yours alone. <br>  <br>  First off- Here what I would do if I were you. I would tell her that you appreciate her caring about you and all, but its really no concern of hers if you talk to your childs father. Thats between you, and the father. Secondly, tell her if she cant act like a civil adult/mother/grandmother tell her she will not be welcome to see you, or your son. I know it sounds harsh but it might make her look at things in a different perspective. Your Mother has no right to treat you like this let alone, tell her the way she is making you feel is affecting the way you care for your son. Tell her she is stressing you out, and if she cared for her Grandson in any way, she would back off so you could be a stress free mommy. <br>  <br>  Please, if you seriously are having suicidal thoughts PLEASE contact your health care provider or a therapist you can talk too. Do it for the sake of your son! Things will get better I promise!!!!!! Hope everything gets better really soon!!!
eV5E9MhUaa	It could upset your stomach. You could try taking it at night before you go to bed. It never made me throw up though.|`|mDt03eXIaa	If it's the wrong dosage for you, then yes it can make you feel nauseous. If it hasn't improved after one cycle, you're supposed to go back and try a different prescription.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I have been on about 5 or 6 different forms of birth control and have never vomited or been nauseous from any of them.  However, birth control comes with an insert that lists the side effects of taking the medicine as well as what to expect when starting it.  Nausea was on the list of every birth control I have taken, I do believe.  It may take some time for your body to adjust to the hormones.  If it persists or is bothersome, call your doctor.|`|BiFw6EWEaa	no its not supposed to make you vomit. maybe you should tell your doctor. it might not work for you. and you could be pregnant|`|mqHL4UcRaa	It will make you sick, yes. It's a high dose of hormones and until your body adjusts, it will make you nauseas.

puCOYwMmaa	You have to decide what things you think are important for you to be "ready" (relationship, finances, emotional stability, career, etc).  After that if you want to you just kind of have to take a leap and decide to do it.  <br>  <br>  At least that's how it was for me.  We had been wanting kids for a couple years but had reasons why the time wasn't right (establishing careers, wanted to be married and 'settled' for a bit before starting, etc) eventually we didn't have any more reasons not to and it was a matter of sitting down and say "yes we're ready, let's go for it!"  <br>  <br>  I think it's a good thing that's it's overwhelming, having kids is a big deal!  For me being in that 'limbo' was worse than saying 'no, not yet' or 'yes, lets try'|`|xue72D76aa	For me, I needed to feel financially stable.  That was the last thing to fall into place (had my education, great husband, married for awhile to enjoy just being married without children) and we decided to plunge in.  Truthfully, you are never really ready.  You don't fully realize what having a child entails until you actually have a child.  I know that seems cliche (I would have thought it was pre-baby days) but now I know that it's the truth, lol!|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	well for one if your unsure.....then your not ready. You will know when your ready. I wasnt that lucky the first time to actually plan to have a baby...it just happen but with the second one coming... i knew for sure i wanted this baby!<br>  <br>  When the time comes...you will know!|`|8a553a06ec63d3305f06ba0fe0b74456aa	Most people can never truly be ready. There will always be things you cannot plan for. You have to plan for the best and able to accept the worst. If you and he feel fully prepared then you should be fine. It is partially a learn as you go process any way.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Are you married? Untill you two completely commit to each other, I wouldn't get pregnant.|`|BiFw6EWEaa	it made me to go for it, coz i wanted to quit smoking, and i just really wanted a baby and i didnt want to wait. And i am married. i got married then a month later i got pregnant. we just made sure we had health insurance before we tried. and that i was ready to quit smoking. and soon as i found out i was pregnant, i quit. if you smoke, please dont smoke while pregnancy. it can do soo much damage.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	if your ready to have sex then your ready to have a baby
YeyPROgAaa	I used the EPT digital.<br>  <br>  I loved when it actually said the word : PREGNANT|`|8wVj8odOaa	save your money! Get your tests from the dollar store.<br>  <br>  Actually if you research HCG levels with pregnancy tests, you will see that the dollar store brand tests are just as good as most of the other, more expensive, big brand labels.<br>  <br>  Plus if you go the cheap route, you can stock up for next month, if you get a negative and are actually trying to conceive!|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I know lots of women like the digital ones because they are super easy to read, but the dollar store ones are perfectly fine and super cheap.|`|RYz45S6zaa	I have to be honest. I purchase those cheap $1 pregnancy test from dollar tree and they were accurate with both of my pregnancies. I was a little less than 4 weeks with both of them.|`|780NrKdfaa	i took first response<br>  and now i have an 8 month old baby boy<br>  aha =]<br>  it helped even my boyfriend took one|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I would get a 3 pack that way if it comes back negative & you miss your period you have a spare without having to go back to the store. Also, you can visit www.peeonastick.com & it can give you which tests are most sensitive to the hCG (pregnancy) hormone.<br>  good luck!|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I got my big positive a week before my period with EPT digital test. I got a double pack at Walmart for about $10, I would say go for this one, it's nice to see words instead of lines :)|`|kVBDpAMTaa	The first test I used was $1 test from Dollar General. I took 6 other ones just to make sure and the first one was correct.|`|HO9RGUx9aa	omg go to the doctor their the best pregnancy test lol|`|ew0FaElzaa	First Response. I got a positive reading and now I'm due anytime. It was fast too!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	CLEAR BLUE! <br>  <br>  It's digital :)
d13578e482d3857d77517c7fe7bebaedaa	She probably heard something like that around school-you know how other kids will imitate grownups. <br>   Kids at that age don't really care for the opposite sex, so I'd probably say something like "You don't have to kiss him if you don't want to.  And when he tells all the other boys about it-all the girls will say how smart you are for not kissing an ugly boy!"|`|MXnSWKCkaa	ok u should explain to her what its really like
QODJNf1oaa	I'd like to think not|`|wURg3jBcaa	Of course.  You can't replace flesh and blood.  (Unless they were adopted, then the parent does feel that they chose that child to be a part of their lives.)  Stepkids are just part of a package deal.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Simple answer: Generally, you cannot love someone else's kids as much as you love your own. It's sad but true.<br>  <br>  Of course you can tolerate them, but it's not the same. Those who say differently have never been a step-mom, step-dad, or a step-kid.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	you know what i don't think that parents will necessarily love step children less.  my grandfather is not my biological grandfather but i tell you what he loves my mom more than anything.  he knows she can and will take care of him and my grandmother when the going gets tough (his biological children have not done the same).  i know he loves me and me kids just like he loves his "real" grandkids.  i don't feel slighted.  i loved him so very much.  he is my pop-pop.  blood or not.  it is possible to have the same love.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	they love both kids in a different way....my MIL is my husband's step mom (his mother died in 2000, I never met her) and she's been his step mom since he wad young....she loves him and his sister differently than her own two children but she loves them all for sure.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes, I know i would if i had to choose between my biologcal child and my step child i would choose my biological child, there is not contest.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Yes. It doesn't mean your a bad person, its just different|`|gJldYuoMaa	not a bit, but its a different type of love that you learn to respect and love even more. You just have to get used to loving someone you "never knew before" and you have to accept them first before you can assume someone else is going to accept them, you brought them into your life so enjoy them while you can, life is a blessing no matter where it comes from. god bless, love mellXXxxXXx|`|DhUMjZxtaa	Yes, I think so. Because that child is YOURS, it has your DNA you know....you made it, of course some how it will be one you love more, or maybe not even LOVE, maybe just one you connect more with or something like that.<br>  <br>  It also kind of depends on how old the step-kids where when you came into their life. If they were really young, you might just love them as much.<br>  <br>  Tough call....I guess it depends on the person.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I honestly think it depends on the person and how big their heart is. My wife was raised by a step-dad since she was 2 years old and he calls her his daughter and she his dad. They are close as can be.<br>  <br>  But some people might not be as open with their hearts, not everybody is as kind. I think you will be fine though because if you are so concerned right now, then you should be a wonderful mother to ALL of your kids.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I think most try to love them equally or at least treat them equally but you can't help but have a more special bond with your biological child. That baby is a part of you and there's nothing quite like it.|`|PdY9ylZCaa	how about that they love their biological children differently from their step children; you have to admit, there is something special about a child being half* of you.|`|m0XWJfJdaa	i dont know<br>  depends on who u are <br>      i personally am lovin my step bro and step sis more then my real bro right now(who is doing drugs and skipin school)<br>     but parents probably love both|`|4kiV8CaNaa	Yes, It's genetic.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Are there some people who would love their biological children more then their step children? Yes.  Are there some people who would love their biological children and step children equally but different? Yes.  I say differently because the fact is every single relationship someone has with someone else is different then the relationship they have with another person. Someone could have four biological children and their relationship is not going to be the same with each child, as each person again is a unique. One can love equally but differently since each child is an individual. The same can be applied to families who have biological and step-kids and or/ adopted kids.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am adopted and my parents have 1 son together and my mom has 2 sons from her first marriage.  My dad loves all of his kids "adopted, bio and stepkids". I put those in quotes because he just refers to all of us as his kids. My dad also had a step father who loved him and his twin brother no different then he loved  their ? sister who was his biological child.  My dad and his brother were 3 when their mom married their step-father and they always referred to him as just Dad.  My older brothers were 10 and 12 when my dad married our mom. They were 8 and 10 when they started dating. <br>  <br>  <br>  I imagine it could also depend on how often someone sees their stepchild (ren) and how close they are.  My  elder brother’s father died of cancer. My dad’s biological father was a drunk/abusive so he was not apart of their lives. In both cases the stepchildren lived full time with their mother and step-father. It might be different for a step-parent who say only sees their step kids during the summers and holidays.|`|hPjPtno0aa	I think it depends completely on the background and story. I'm not going to pretend I know the answer because i am only 16 but i had a stepdad when i was about 10-12 and he loved me just as much as his own kids if not more but he did not get along with my brothers this wasn't because i'm a girl and their not i think it was personality and we spent alot more time together.<br>  <br>  I think the more people have gone through or the younger you meet someone the more you bond but i know thats not always the case<br>  i don't think the man meant it like that really though x|`|782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	I don't think you'll stop loving and caring for your stepdaughter when you have a baby. But, you'll probably realize there's a special bond between you and your biological son or daughter. Especially for a mother who carries that baby and gives birth. Having your own children is a different experience than having stepchildren. With that being said, I don't think you'll treat your stepdaughter like chopped liver, and I am sure you will still love her. You'll just have two different types of relationships/bonds with each of the children.|`|88SGoW1Iaa	Don't let it bother you, he doesn't dislike the others by saying that, he just has a unbreakable bond with his biological children, they're his flesh and blood and he can feel that. It's like an invisible connection that is very strong and gthat happens to be a different connection than the others|`|dtwkBXv3aa	to be honest although no one will admit it im sure people love their biological children more. one reason. other than flesh and blood, is that your with the child from day 1. u see the child grow and bond with you. as for step kids, you might be with them when they're much older, sometimes teens, and you never really developed that relationship with them.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	I think it is only natural. It's not that you love them less, but that you love them differently. You won't be taking love away from your step-daughter, you will just have more new love for the new person.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Of course they do. They birthed their biological child. That child is a part of them. Their step child is only related by marriage, as such, they most likely won't love them the same.|`|ZGelYopdaa	i know step parents who love their step kids just as much as their biological kids!!! the dad just had his first child that is his own flesh and blood so I am sure he is feeling overwhelmed with love and adoration for his new baby!!|`|kml4wGw4aa	People will always love their biological children more simply because they carry them for 9 months....go through the physical pain...and bond with them from birth....just the truth.|`|sBJtxJG9aa	yes. its cuz the kids are their own. The kids are part of them.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	I would assume yes, they are a part of you.  It's just a different kind of love.|`|80A6iHoGaa	Yep I sure do|`|NnXKDZIsaa	no doubt, it's nature.|`|00XBwf1Haa	the answer is YES YES YES 100%|`|KGrMMAOaaa	i think it's different for everyone<br>  <br>  i guess when you have a child there's more of a bond you know? bc you gave birth to them and you didn't give birth to the step child. also you see the baby you have grow and learn where the step child may already be grown for the most part so you didnt have much to do with that process.<br>  <br>  but if you form a bond with your step children and dont think of them any differently and they dont think of you differently from a biological family member then you will care for them equally. it sounds like you will bc your concerned with loving them equally so you prob will. i wouldnt worry about it :)|`|LSJyE4d0aa	I had an eight year old daughter when I got married to my husband.. he has been such a good father figure to her. Her real father was never in the picture. We have three children together and my oldest daughter is now 16. I think its normal for people to have more love for thier biological children, however, in this case my husband has shown nothing but love to Tish. The other day we were in the car and a Brad Paisley song came on about a step father being a dad that he didn't have to be. Tish teared up and I did to, becasue we realize how lucky we are to have my husband. He is a great man|`|seaQ7nw6aa	Well I think so. But not with their biological baby, but biological kid yeah. Because If they have been with their kid for their whole life, they would treasure them and love them because they loved and lived with them their whole life! They hardly know the step kid. They just met em'.  But they know their kid's name already and they probably say(for example name) to their step-children " Hey Conny! i mean Kenny!!! " sad but, that's what I think........|`|29a2wm7Eaa	This question made me feel quite ugly inside.  The truth is, as much as I know I could love stepchildren, I don't think I could love them as much as my own child unless they were babies when they came into your life.  The intimacy that is shared at that stage of life just wouldn't be there.  The feeding, the care and the way you grow together through all the stages.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I have been a part of my step-son's (I don't normally use this term, he is my son) life for 6 years and I love him unconditionally. My husband has been apart of my our boys (he is adopting them) lives just as long and feels the same as I do about our eldest. We may not have contributed shared dna for all of our boys but we have contributed so much more than that together. I think it really depends on the person and how adaptive they can be.|`|8WEFPUDUaa	i think that u will feel my connectedto ur child because u accually had her/him. u might love him/her more but  i think u will love them all very close to the same. u just have to forget the deatiles and think that they r all ur children and treat them all the same.|`|3HpItOpjaa	Unfortunately, there's no way around it, it's a different kind of love, I would like to think that if the step children were in your life since infancy, than maybe it would compare.|`|a6zIbwKcaa	yes|`|kGv9wMPWaa	The way that you love your kids, you will never love anyone else.  The child that comes from you is your true love.  I have a step daughter, but I have only seen the girl about 6 times.  But I can't imagine loving her the way I love my son.  So sorry, but that's just the way it is.|`|nuTvB84Gaa	Well I am a step daughter to my mothers new husband and he says the same thing about his new and first child..<br>  That the baby is his life..<br>  And It doesn't make me feel to great.<br>  But I think he doe's love me alot but this is all new to him because he had no children then married my mom and got 4 right off.<br>  And this was his first child.<br>  <br>  Also my biological dad married a new woman and she has a daughter.<br>  And my biological dad his step daughter more then he loves me and my brother and sister.<br>  He will buy her EVERYTHING she wants.<br>  And he wont buy us anything.<br>  For christmas I got a little bit of cash and she got a four wheel that cost about 1,000 something..<br>  It just depends on the person as to what they love more.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)
R5fe3CPPaa	It is not terrible. I went through an abortion about 5 years ago. I went to a great place where they were gentle and caring. It is a choice you have to make for yourself. Afterwards you just have a VERy heavy period and cramps. They give you medication to help with the pain. I was in bed for one day and then I was fine. You just can't lift anything heavy for about a week. Good luck to you! <br>  <br>  IT IS YOUR CHOICE!!!!!!!! Not anyone elses.|`|MnZxoLwtaa	im 18 yrs. old . <br>  i had an abortion 2 wks ago on tuesday . <br>  it felt so uncomfortable , no pain really . <br>  after it i felt better nothing went wrong . <br>  some bxtchyass cramps while doing the suction . <br>  but after it was emotional for me to know what i did <br>  since i was against it but had no other choice .<br>  my boyfriend was hurt but understood my reasons .<br>  but now its going away like nothing happen no more crying . <br>  learn my lesson to use protection !|`|j8S5mNZJaa	idk how it feels but i kno now u feel like u wnna get rid of it but tht's not the answer deal with it ur the one tht creaated this bby u WILL regret it l8r wen u think about it. u will luv it DONT ABORT!!!|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Reasons Why People Want Abortions: <br>  A. If these are valid before birth, why not after birth too? <br>  baby conceived outside of wedlock <br>  parents incapable of caring for baby <br>  baby will have inferior quality of life <br>  fetus not able to survive outside body of mother by itself <br>  B. Baby conceived as result of rape <br>  extremely rare: 0 pregnancies out of 4500 rape cases <br>  This is a red herring it never happens! <br>  should child suffer for sin of another? <br>  C. Pregnancy seriously endangers life of mother <br>  abortion permitted because it can be viewed as saving life of mother, otherwise both will die|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Abortion is not fun to go through, and in my opinion it is easier to have the child and either keep it or give it up for adoption, that is of course if its not for medical reasons. I has one when I was 16, i had an eptopic pregnancy and I was depressed and so messed up not to mention i had a lot of bleeding, vomiting, cramping, i felt like $hit for weeks. Im now 24 and pregnant again and I am still dealing with it, i have sever depression still.<br>  <br>  not to mention what the child goes through, since it can feel pain, how would you like your body riped apart. Abortion is just not worth it<br>   <br>  aside from medical reasons why abort something you know you are going to wind up loving anyway?<br>  <br>  The emotional side effects following an abortion will vary from woman to woman. Some women report relief after an abortion. The question that most people ask is, “What are the potential emotional and psychological risks following an abortion?” <br>  <br>  Emotional and psychological effects are more common than the potential physical side effects and they can range from mild regret to more serious complications like depression. It is important to talk through these risks with a trained professional who can address your questions and discuss your concerns.<br>  <br>  Questions about Abortion, call 1-866-942-6466<br>  <br>  What are the potential emotional and psychological sides effects following an abortion?<br>  The following is a list of emotional and psychological side effects that may be experienced following an abortion. The intensity or duration of these effects will vary from person to person. Here is a list of potential side effects that may be of concern to you:<br>  <br>  <br>  Regret <br>  Anger <br>  Guilty feelings <br>  Shame <br>  Loneliness or isolation <br>  Impaired self confidence <br>  Insomnia or nightmares <br>  Relationship issues <br>  Suicidal thoughts and feelings <br>  Eating disorders <br>  Depression <br>  Anxiety <br>  Are there individuals who are more prone to experience emotional or psychological problems?<br>  It is possible for anyone to experience an emotional or psychological side effect following an abortion. Women commonly report that the abortion procedure affected them more than they thought it would. However, there are individuals who are more susceptible to experience some type of emotional or psychological struggle. Below is a list of circumstances that may increase a woman’s chances of having an emotional or psychological side effect:<br>  <br>  Individuals with previous emotional or psychological issues <br>  Individuals who have been coerced, forced or persuaded to get an abortion <br>  Individuals with religious beliefs that conflict with abortion <br>  Individuals with moral or ethical positions that conflict with abortion <br>  Individuals who obtain an abortion in later stages of their pregnancy <br>  Individuals without support from significant others or their partner <br>  Obtaining an abortion for genetic or fetal abnormalities <br>  What are the recommendations for someone considering an abortion?<br>  Get Help – Probably the most important thing you can do when facing an unplanned pregnancy is to talk with trained professionals who can answer your questions and discuss your circumstances with you.<br>  <br>  Avoid Isolation – If you are experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, you may have the tendency to withdraw from others, keep things a secret, and try to face it alone. Although it may be difficult, make sure you are staying connected with family and friends who are there to support you. Isolation under these circumstances can lead to depression.<br>  <br>  Evaluate Your Circumstances – Take a look and see if your circumstance includes any of the situations noted above under those who are more prone to experience a side effect. Talk through this with someone who can help you understand what it might mean for you.<br>  <br>  Avoid Pressure – Stay away from people who are pressuring you and coercing you to do what they think is best. Whether you parent, place or have an abortion, you are the one who will have to live with your choice.<br>  <br>  Talk to Others – See if you can find someone who has gone through an unplanned pregnancy or an abortion and find out what it was like for them. Take a moment to ask questions of someone who has been there.<br>  <br>  <br>  The physical side effects after an abortion will vary from woman to woman. There are both side effects to expect as well as risks that you need to know exist.

I don't regret my decision. Not one bit. Nor do I feel guilty. I know it is a hard decision and not one to be taken lightly. You have to weigh all your options. If you come to the decision that you want an abortion, then you have to do what you have to do. Do not let anyone make you feel bad for your decision. After my abortion I had some mild cramping and moderate bleeding for about a week and light bleeding for about a week after that. Good luck with what ever you choose. If you have any questions feel free to message me.|`|RPoFBenJaa	Google "abortion" and click on images. Then you'll know how bad it is. When they give someone an abortion they cut the fetus into pieces inside you, then pull it out. Im not trying to violate any yahoo guidelines when I write this either. My curiosity got the best of me one time and I had to know the truth so I googled it, and Its been a bad image in my mind ever since. Its a sad truth.|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	The abortion itself doesn't feel bad.  They do numb you and you can't really feel anything.  You do feel a little crampy while they cause you to go into early labor to get the baby out.  I had such bad morning sickness prior that it went away that same day.  I can't say that the guilt factor wasn't high afterwards though.  I still deal with this decision every day.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	it is different for every women.<br>  some are emotional.<br>  others are in pain.<br>  some both.<br>  many dont feel anything.<br>  i am pro choice, although i would never do it.

The placenta causes the HCGs to remain high. in Some cases, methotrexate is used to kill the tissue. if you feel at all off, yo need to talk to a doc asap. <br>  <br>  the cancerous form of molar pregnancy is the most aggressive cancer yet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydatidiform_mole" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydatidifor...</a>|`|hAuemuWTaa	No u r not pregnant yes ur levels will drop within 48 hours but not completly it can take some time for ur body to be back to its normal self.

yN4awnZpaa	sorry to hear about your struggles. I too have been trying to conceive baby number two for 9 long cycles so far. and this was my first month on Clomid and im cd 22 so waiting a few more days to test. I conceive baby # 1 on the first try (no fertility drugs) and just dont understand why its taken almost a year to conceive again.|`|ddCU9KTWaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianmedguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianmedguru.com</a><br>  You can get much information in this website.|`|Efe7wstZaa	Hi there.. <br>  First of all..

8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	No no no, do NOT give him bananas and dairy products, or least give them sparingly. Bananas and especially cheese are EXTREMELY constipating. Giving him more will only make it worse. I agree with giving him some water (they make that baby water nowadays, in the formula isle). Also since he's old enough, give him cheerios.. the whole grains will help. Might try feeding him more applesauce and veggies too. applesauce is healthy and it's got  a TON of fiber in it.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	he could be a lil constipated. offer him some cool boiled water to help loosen him up a lil:)|`|I0rOL46aaa	Make sure he's drinking enough water and especially dairy products.  This could be the reason why.  Also, try and get a bit of bran into his diet, along with bananas.  Definitely bananas.  Steer him off the sugary juice if he's drinking that, and make sure he's eating enough fruits and vegetables.  I know that sounds like a lecture from a pediatrician but these are all key things in having normal bowel movements.  If this keeps up for more than a week, talk to your family doctor/pediatrician, but overall make sure that, for drinks, he sticks mainly to milk and water.<br>  -Alice|`|WDnpaCe1aa	I believe he need water, lots of water. Feed him some warm soup and veggies. After a day or 2 his poo should be better.|`|1S7uXsInaa	If it does not bother him, do not let it bother you.  The foods that he eats can have a influence on this.

Am I misunderstanding the question?<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  If she got a faint pink line then she is pregnant. The line only shows up when there is the pregnancy hormone present in her body. <br>  <br>  The birth control will not abort the baby, but it could be harmful to keep taking it for a prolonged period. <br>  It will not induce your friend's period either, once she is pregnant that will stop. <br>  <br>  She may spot a bit with implantation or the new pregnancy, but it will be very, very light.|`|RjoCYCkQaa	the pill is not necessary as long as you get you daily supply of man gravy down the hatch.|`|kT7GVOosaa	if your pregnant you shouldn't be on birth control. it is harmful to the baby. if you are asking if you can get a period when pregnant and stopping your birth control then the answer is no.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	You can't have a period while you're pregnant, just slight spotting. <br>  Also, quit taking the pill until you know for sure.|`|W1p6LetFaa	If you are pregnant, you should not be taking birth control at all!

You try to get job and participate as an active boyfriend role.|`|taOckxHxaa	You are the father of a child.  It is never acceptable to slap or punch his or her mother.  Look in the mirror.  You need to grow up...with God's help.|`|puCOYwMmaa	Yes it is that bad.  Hitting your girlfriend isn't just "bad" it's criminal.<br>  <br>  It's never okay to hit another person, let alone your pregnant girlfriend.  <br>  Good for her for kicking you out<br>  <br>  You're 22 and have never had a job?  It sounds like you are lazy.  Grow up, get a job, go to anger management, send child support.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	Sounds to me like YOU need to change YOUR ways. She did the right thing by kicking you out.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Start by changing yourself.|`|IlSALGKMaa	You made this same board a couple days ago. Go to hell, that's how.|`|R02XSpGGaa	Is this an actual question or a joke? I can never tell these days...|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	You're an a**. You shouldn't be slapping her or punching her or anything EVER, but especially not when she's pregnant. Does it make you feel more manly to beat on her? It's men like you that don't deserve to be on this earth let alone procreate. I congratulate her tossing your a** out. I wouldn't want you around either. If she's smart she won't let you come back and she'll sue you for child support. Maybe you should stop acting like a 12 year old and let your balls drop. Go get a job and stop being a lazy bum. Stop beating on women and take care of your child.|`|DksDTsuQaa	1st i would like to say that you should never hit a female while she is pregnant even if she wasn't. at this time she is having mood swings this is part of pregnancy .why don't your parents know shes pregnant? i think that since your parents don't know shes pregnant then you deserve to be where you are today ..get a job and grow up|`|bef68894c6c158e56dfd305f51801d35aa	You probably are a lazy piece of ****! Dont you ever put your hand on a woman ever. she should've castrated your ***! so you could never reproduce ever again! I feel bad for your baby because he/she has a piece of **** for a father.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I AGREE! YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO CHANGE! WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU HITTING A WOMAN AND A PREGNANT WOMAN AT THAT! YOU DESERVE TO BE SITTING IN JAIL HAVING SOMEBODY MAKE YOU THIER *****! DUMBASS|`|j6VRLlhjaa	She doesnt need to change her ways, But you sure could use a ball bat upside your head maybe it would knock some scence into u! Good for her for kicking you out, ABUSER!|`|xY0iRgqSaa	how do you get her to change her ways? i think you need to change yours first.|`|AA10381258	You are a first class loser. Obviously, you are lazy if you are 22 and never had a job, just living off your girlfriend. Grow up and take some responsibility in your life. I'd have kicked your *** to the curb a long time ago. As for slapping and punching a woman: you are scum. Don't date any more until you can respect women. Troll.|`|ZGe1XW5Qaa	You should apologize to her for hitting her. Even if she was "acting up," that's no excuse to hit her. Also, she's pregnant, which isn't all that great for the baby. Maybe instead of telling her that you want to come back, you should show her by acting more mature and being less lazy.|`|4rILp7Lfaa	well first i would find a job <br>  second i would try to talk to ur girlfriend<br>  third i would tell ur parents<br>  looks like ur biggest thing is finding a job and keeping it before she has the baby prove to her that u are responsible and not lazy|`|QAmgy7oXaa	wow quit being lazy take up for your child, GET A JOB and dont hit your girlfriend? dumbass?|`|a4csOGFNaa	tell her your sorry and give her her fav flowers she might take you back
erKyfwSbaa	If your not sure, take a pregnancy test. They have them at the 99 cent store.  It sounds like your fine though. It is rare to have a "period" when your pregnant.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Ur fine!!
eV5E9MhUaa	You need to call your OB asap... that could be a sign of a serious condition. I'm not meaning to scare you, but you need to call right away.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	my hands and feet have been swollen for months. its normal,i think its cuz of the weight gain,but thats probably not the right reason.|`|BiFw6EWEaa	it means your gonna have healthy babies. i just read about it on a site. haha
xRZ1PRZwaa	I've learned about a lot of gadgets for little ones and differing schools of thought on parenting approaches. They're all interesting.<br>  <br>  The most interesting to me, though, was about Subchronic Hematoma. I had complications when I was pregnant in 2007 and was told that I miscarried. Long story short, I ended up with a gorgeous sweet little boy. I was told that it might have been vanishing twin, but having heard about Subchronic Hematoma here, I wonder now if that might have been a possible explanation as well.<br>  <br>  Great question!|`|pJiTbIpYaa	have learnt many interesting things. But i will say on of the best pieces of advice i got was to not care what others think about public breastfeeding. The first time i ever breastfed in public i was abused. A woman told me that it is my right to BF in public and that it is no one else's business. She gave my the confidence i need to BF my next bub in public. I will always be grateful to that answerer for her words of encouragement.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	there was this woman and he daughter in law had a baby <br>  her and the daughter in law didnt get along she was about sixty and wanted to know how she could start lacting so she could breastfeed her grand daughter <br>  because she didnt like the way mommy was doing it <br>  to me that was interesting but way over the top|`|jNErU39iaa	Well, the breastfeeding Nazi's have informed us all numerous times that formula is actually POISON! <br>  Who knew?!! <br>  (Ha ha that was a joke!)<br>  <br>  It's probably not interesting - but more validating. I love to know that there are HUNDREDS of women out there with the same questions and worries as me. I like to know that *most* of the women out there feel the same way as I do about the post baby body, which is not so great! I love Y!A, it makes me feel like I'm not so alone in this 'new mummy' world and that there are probably millions of mothers thinking the exact same question that I have answered on Y!A.<br>  <br>  =]|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I don't know what the most interesting thing would be, at least not offhand. But I have learned a lot and seen some very entertaining arguments if that's what you'd call them. Heard a lot of cute baby stories. I have also seen a lot of cute babies which always makes for a good day.|`|14JQ11AUaa	I have learned a lot about drama and breastfeeding, formula feeding lol. That seems to be the only type of questions in this area unfortunately!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Has to be a tossup between BLW and cloth diapers!  I'm a convert to both.  :)|`|dAQHWvY0aa	The most interesting thing? That my Y!A bff's are always there, with answers and wisdom beyond my wildest to help me through the craziness!!! Hollllaaa, Kelshizzle *said like snoop dog* *giggles*<br>  Oh, and also that there are a bezillion different perspectives on how to properly raise a child - Very few are totally wrong, many are VERRRRY different, and almost everything given as advice is meant to be helpful, even if it only makes you laugh!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I've learned so much-First, I never knew what a big debate things like breastfeeding vs. formula, vaccinations, and circumcisions were. When my daughter was a newborn, someone on Y!A suggested rubbing her tummy and pushing her legs up towards her tummy to get rid of gas. It sounded strange, but it worked really well!|`|MeYILJeSaa	That it's okay to breastfeed past a year. It's crazy how much more open-minded I am about parenting than I was a year ago. A year ago I also would have never even considered co-sleeping. <br>  Here I am, co-sleeping and planning on breastfeeding at least to two years. AND planning on making my own baby food.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	I have learnt that some people just have NO idea, a 2.5 month old can speak in sentences, my 17 month old is being poisoned because she has a french fry every now and then, people shouldnt have children out of wedlock (mmmmm it is 1955 isnt it), that im a terrible parent because my daughter still has a bottle at bedtime (jeez call DOCS)....sry im on a bit of a mission today!!!!
2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	Yes I am married. <br>   <br>  Do I look down on those who have children out of wedlock no...Our first daughter was born before we got married.<br>  <br>  What I do look down on is the ones that choose not to get married because they get assistance for being low income.  Getting welfare, food stamps, medicaid...etc.  I know plenty of people that don't get married cause their food stamps and medicaid will stop.  It really gets me mad when my husband and I work our butts off to provide for our children, while other people take the easy way out and have it better off than we do.|`|UNXf7lZZaa	I'm not married, but I am engaged.<br>  However, I was not engaged when I had my first child. I feel sometimes as if I am looked down upon by those that are. I think they feel as if I should be married to have kids. But I'm a stable mother and I have been with the same man since I was sixteen, therefore I feel as though I am a perfectly good mother and there shouldnt be a reason for others who are married to look down on me.|`|iLLoc003aa	I am married and I had 2 planned children at the 4th and 6th year of marriage but that is how I chose it and I am no one to judge others. What works for me may not work for others and vice versa...I just think that what is most important is that the children are loved and well taken care of..I don't think it matters if the mom and dad are married or not...|`|j6VRLlhjaa	I am 4 mths. along and living w my boyfriend  Everyone wants to know when we r gettin married, It aggravates the piss out of me, I have chosen to NOT get married while I am pregnant cuz I never want to wonder if thats why he married me. Also I want to get married on my own terms Not because "society" feels its the right thing to do. I love him He loves me and thats all there is to it, Whats a peice of paper? I am 37 and people say  'Well your already pregnant and live 2 gether so why not, You know what I think, It is none of their damn bussiness this is our life not theirs and if they dont like it to bad! Am I looked down upon yeah by some but you know what... Judge not lest ye be judged!|`|sK67bBy5aa	I am married. But When i had my children i was not. On some I do look down to them, but not for having children out of wedlock. i look down on them cause all there children are for different men!|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Not married but engaged. Definitely planning to get married, it is just a matter of when. I do feel looked down upon but i truly don't care. Our daughter was planned, she is not the spawn of the devil, she is not illegitimate and she is very, very loved and very, very wanted.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I am married.. we got married in July 2007, pregnant in Sept 2007 and Had our son June 2008...eventful year Lil<br>  <br>  I don't look down on those moms who are not married..one of my good friends is not married and is a mom of a 3 1/2 year old boy. She does a great job as a single mom  and works hard to provide for her and her son....the dad is a bonafide loser but at least he still sees his son.|`|xPgKWIigaa	Not Married. Would have liked to have been before i had kids, but it didnt happen that way!<br>  I dont look down upon anyone having kids in our out of wedlock. If a couple choose to never marry - thats fine - dp what is best for you and the children - sometimes marriage isnt it.<br>   We plan on getting married one day,  probably when the kids are about 5 and would look so very cute in the wedding!!!|`|BUI9HnH1aa	im not married , and not engaged either .. <br>  my partner and i have been together for 6 years and our son is 5 months old .. <br>  I think i will be waiting at least another 6 years for him to get his act in to gear and ask me to marry him , lol <br>  <br>  I dont feel that im looked down on , i have met a few ppl while i was pregnant that told me i had to get married ... i laughed at them .<br>  I dont think marraige means the same as it did 50 years ago .. So many ppl get married and end up divorced 3 years later ..|`|prqrQcd1aa	I am not married. I have 3 kids, and live with a man who is not the father of any of them, although i've known him for 18 years. I do think there are times when I am looked down upon, but honestly I don't really care. Of course I don't look down upon people who have had children out of wedlock.|`|6RGnG1ukaa	I am married. To the same guy I had my children with, might i add. I do not look down upon those that are married. Though I think sex before marriage usually happens. But if you don't plan on using protection you should be married to the person who you are having sex with. <br>  <br>  Now mothers who are divorced I don't feel this way towards. I feel like they tried to make things work but it is best off with them and their child.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I am married. However, when I had my first child I was not. I do not look down on people that have children out of wedlock. Some people are not even interested in getting married. Or they choose not to get married because the relationship would not benefit the child if the parents don't get along so great anymore. To each's own is how I look at it. All in all the only thing that truly matters is the happiness of your children.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I am married, yes.  We also were married before we got pregnant; I know some get married BECAUSE they are pregnant!<br>  <br>  I do not look down on unmarried families.  My best friend got pregnant at 17 and didn't get married right away.  As long as people marry for the right reasons, I think it's a great idea!  BUT marriage doesn't guarantee a happy life or well-adjusted kids.  LOL just look at the divorce rate!  ;)<br>  My ultimate feelings are, while I believe in marriage, I sdo understand why some do not feel it is necessary or even a big deal.  It's been warped by a culture of convenience (quickie divorces anyone??), and isn't always a good thing.  That makes me sad!  There are many happy unmarried families out there, and a loving committed couple will raise children who feel that love, regardless of being married or not.|`|jNErU39iaa	I'm not married, and don't intend on being married any time soon, but would (eventually) like to be.<br>  <br>  I do sometimes feel other (married) parents look down on me, like I'm some how harming my daughter - but I don't see how a scrap paper with a wedding license would make me a better mother, or give my daughter a happier life.<br>  <br>  I think people who do have a problem with it are living in the 50's and need to wake up and smell the coffee beans. The important thing is not whether the parents are married, but if the child is HAPPY and HEALTHY =]|`|u94HOVz7aa	no i am not at one time i was married to my baby's daddy, but things happened.  Now we are back together, but i refuse to re marry him.  I guess i don't feel looked down apon, but mostly i feel this way because i don't care what others think.  Its my life and i will live it how i like its not theirs to live.  i dont look down on others i feel everyone is entitled to live how they choose its not my life i can't make their choices for them|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	I'm married but I think the most important thing is that children are loved and taken care of. People look down their noses at single Moms but most of the cases of child abuse resulting in death I've seen on my local news have involved married couples.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I am married now but when I had my daughter I wasn't married, and didn't even end up marrying the man who got me pregnant|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I am married, but hey babies happen out of wedlock. I would be lying to say I didn't have sex until my wedding night.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	yup. my husband and I got married when I was 10 weeks pregnant.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	I just had a baby with my boyfriend in December. I don't think I've been looked down upon at all. I mean in this day and age having a baby out of wedlock is pretty normal I think. Both of our families have been very supportive.<br>  <br>  Of course we are planning on getting married eventually, we just don't have money to have a wedding.<br>  <br>  I think it's more looked down upon to have a children with several different men than anything.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I'm not married, ive been with my daughters dad for 5 years and do not really feel like being married.  I love him and he loves me, we live together and have a great relationship.  We plan on getting married eventually, but we arent going to rush it.. we feel no need to.  I don't feel looked down on, but ive never paid attention enough to feel like someone looks down on me.  Im happy, and my children are happy.|`|gJldYuoMaa	nup nop no!!!!!!!!!!!!! im with my partner nearly 7 years we have a 4 yr old and a one year old,im 24 he is 25, our house is nearly built and we will be moving in about 8 months time and im not married to him and i am in no rush, either is he, i will never be in a rush either as im quiet happy being the way we are now, we are engaged, and its me putting off the wedding as i want my kids and home to come first, but marriage is not everything  "as statistics now a days" more people are getting divorced or seperated than marrying, and thats why there is "so many kids out of marriage" i commend the ones "that marry out of love" rather than marry because of a child or they think they have to"!|`|rhPCJfeuaa	I married my college sweetheart.   We met when I was 20 and he was 21.  I was 26 when we got married, and now I am 39.  So we've been together for most of our adult life and it still feels great.  He's my best friend.  I was in my early 30's with our first child, though I lost 2 before her.  I don't look down on women who have children out of wedlock, but I do wonder why some don't marry when they've been with the same man for years.  If you act LIKE your married, and you FEEL like you're married, why not GET married?  I know couples who refer to themselves as husband and wife but are not married, and it's not for lack of funding.  I know others who wear rings, but are not married.  I'll admit I don't quite get it, but I don't look down at them.  I do, however have a problem with women who have lots of kids by different men.  Or who don't get married so they can continue getting government aid.  But, in the end, I shrug my shoulders and just decide it's not my business and I don't have to know why people make the choices they do.  As long as they take care of their kids and love them well, who am I to judge?  Hell....I know plenty of married people who don't take care of their kids like some single women I know.  Hope I didn't offend anyone.  Just thinking out loud and being honest.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I'm married. but it doesn't matter to me if people have children out of wedlock...as long as there are two loving parents. And even sometimes a woman becomes a single mother and that's okay too, it's a bit sad for the child but as long as the mother takes care of her baby it's okay, i think|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	My now husband and I conceived out of wedlock (though our wedding date was already set when conceived), and I did feel like I was being judged. The sad part is that I felt I had let down my now husband's parents, because it seemed like I tainted their good ol' Christian boy. Though they adore mw now and all our children!<br>  <br>  Well I was the one to choose to not move up our wedding since either way our daughter would know the truth. Still, I do feel slightly in the wrong, but am glad we had our daughter then, or else she wouldn't be here at all!!|`|165WRAJdaa	I am married and no I dont look down on moms that arent married. I know what youre saying though Moms are a judgemental lot. If its not whether your married its who your married to or how young you were when you got married. Then theres formula feeding versus breastfeeding and on and on. Its always something so dont worry about it!|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Yes I am married.. However, I had my oldest when I was sixteen years old. Her father was never in the picture. Tish has been such a blessing in my life though. My husband has as well, we were married eight years ago and have three daughters. I do not frown upon people who are not married when they have children at all.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I'm married.<br>  But it's ridiculous how when you're out in public and people will make a point to look at your hand to see if you're married. When I was pregnant and my hands were too swollen to wear my rings, I got the most horrible looks. People would actually CRANE their necks to look at my hand.<br>  Haha, what's even funnier is that if I was out with my husband, he was still wearing wedding ring and I wasn't (swollen) I would get even worse glares because people thought I was his mistress or something out with a married man. Ugh. It's so annoying how people think they get to judge people and the way they live their lives. Why people even care is beyond me.<br>  <br>  Shannon: Really? I didn't know being married made a difference when it comes to benefits?|`|VHgfWPS2aa	I think if a women takes care of her children and her man then she is the best wife and mum she can be ;) ... When I am speaking with someone I always refer to her BF as her husband I think it's nice to traet ppl like that ..<br>  <br>  Married but not when I had my first baby :)|`|zmbeIbx7aa	With my first I was not married but engaged to be married in the summer and our little boy was due in the fall.

qHAgbuHkaa	Don't worry. If he's exclusively breastfed, he's unlikely to get constipated. Although most breastfed babies do produce 1 or more bowel movements a day, having him go without one for 24 hours isn't a huge concern. It sounds like you have already done all the right things. He probably will soon. The only thing I can think of is that something you're eating may be plugging him up a bit. If he's not backed up, then he probably just hasn't pooped for some fluke reason. Sorry if this is TMI, but I'm usually very regular. I usually need to go every morning when I wake up. I go almost every day right away in the morning, but I skip a day every now and then. I would say I go 6 out of the 7 mornings a week. Just once in awhile, I skip a day and I'm not constipated or anything. There is a chart you could peek at and see if anything you're eating correlates with him possibly being a little plugged up, but I bet you anything he's just skipping a day for no reason. Good luck and good job for breastfeeding!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_breast-milk-interactions-chart_8788.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_breast-milk-...</a>|`|DcLiW4bbaa	My 2 month old daughter is breastfed and she averages one poop every 1-2 days. It's normal. I wouldn't worry about it unless she seems very uncomfortable/fussy or goes longer then 6 days.<br>  <br>  When she does poop, make sure there aren't any hard bits in it. If there are, then you can call the doctor because it should all be really soft. Hard poop = constipation.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	My son is also exclusively breastfed.  He may have one bowel movement a day, or one every 2-3 days.  I would say it's completely normal.  The son of a friend of mine didn't have a bowel movement for almost 2 weeks.  Apparently doctors don't worry until it goes even longer than that!|`|VHgfWPS2aa	Thats normal mine didn't go for a week then look out it was all over lol|`|IlIjGTdiaa	Totally normal. Exclusively breastfed babies cannot get constipated. It is very common not to have a bowel movement, only go to the doctors if it's been over a week or so. My friends baby only poos every 10 days, and apparently when my sister was a baby she went for 16 days without a poo. My mum took her to the doctor...and she pooed all over him! Anyway, you've done everything right to help the bowel movements along but there's no need to worry. :-)|`|95pvqcMpaa	Yes this is completely normal. My son is exclusively breastfeed as well and he is 4 months old. He usually has a bowel movement everyday but occasionally he does 4-5 days without one.|`|Vqqc54oNaa	it normal for a baby that little who is breastfed to go up to 6 days without one.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	very normal... sometimes they just don't have to poop...if it goes longer than 3 days that is when I'd maybe call the doctor, especially if he seems uncomfortable.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	Telephone the doctor and ask, I can't see that it would be, but just check to be safe if it seems unusual.
bQTATDTyaa	6 weeks is about the time for a big growth spurt.<br>  <br>  My baby cries and doesn't sleep everyday though, so good luck.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Babies can run a low grade fever for absolutely no reason.  She could be just crying cause she's a baby, they're even entitled to a bad day.  Crying for a newborn can peak around now.  They are started to notice there surroundings, and it can be overwhelming!  If it continues, and happen 3 or more times a week, it could also be colic, which also peaks at this time.  There is probably nothing wrong with your baby, she's a baby, and they cry.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	With a low grade fever like that, even at 6 weeks, it is ok to give baby a teeny tiny bit of infant tylenol. Not even the recommended lowest dose. Maybe one or 2 drops on her tongue. Since she's been really fussy, she could also be a little gassy. Try giving her some Gripe Water if you can get it. It's an all natural gas reliever for babies. Another thing to do is give baby a soft massage. It can help relax her, and also help get any air bubbles out of her little tummy. When in doubt, you can always snuggle her and just let her know that mommy's there and that she's gonna be ok. Make sure you talk to her as you're doing things with and to her so she "knows" what's going on. She may not understand your words, but she'll understand mommy's reassuring voice! If her temp gets higher or she starts acting really sick, call the dr!|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	Babies have their days just like we do they just show it by fussing and other things she may even have a slight cold, if she is like that tomorrow call her ped and have him/her check her out for piece of mind!! It is hard being a first time mommy every little out of the ordinary freaks you out, I am sure she is fine but like I said call if you are still concerned tomorrow.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Could be gas. Might be an ear infection if there are no noticeable symptoms. My daughter was just a few months old and we just took her to the doctor because she was crying inconsolably...turned out to be an ear infection. Give her some baby tylenol, and try propping her mattress up at an angle to reduce pressure on her ears.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It's probably just a small cold, it is the season after all. If the fever gets higher, call the DR. Just watch it and cuddle away.|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	she could have a cold. I would try giving her baby tylenol or unless you think it might be worse then that...just call the doctor!|`|whROrAhFaa	Actually, what alot of ppl don't know, especially first timers (Congrats and LOTSA luck, btw) but infants under 2 years old aren't considered to have a "fever" until it reaches 101degrees, also it depends on where on the child you read the temp.  If you are reading it rectally then you subtract a degree.  At 6 wks babies are starting to get used to being at home and with family.  If you tend to hold baby while she sleeps it can cause these types of issues when you try to put her down to sleep.  At that age she should sleep a good 12 to 18 hours a day, some a little more some a little less.  I have 3 and they all had different amts at different ages.  Don't let it get to you, I'd also suggest a swing on low or they make a seat for infants that will actually rock them, it's with the swings in the baby dept of most stores.  She may also like to lay in a boppy pillow and just watch everything, she is learning to see a little farther and clearer now and is gonna be super curious!  If you get a little aggravated with trying to pacify her, put her where u can see her and wash some dishes, let her cry a little.  It's good for baby and the water sound may soothe her, but it will def lessen the volume in your ears while giving you something to do for the frustration =) Hang in there...it gets better, keep in mind now she'll start to babble and play<br>  -Mom of 3 in Baltimore|`|bef68894c6c158e56dfd305f51801d35aa	Your baby probably has colic......my baby was the same way and I switched his formula to Similac Alimentum. It really helped! Also your baby could be gassy. I suggest using Milicon gas drops because they are very gentle on your baby and it is not absorbed by the body which makes it totally safe to use after every feeding on even the newest of newborns! Hope this helps and good luck!|`|ZuhvDanxaa	When babies are less than 3 months, it's better to call the Doctor and tell her about it just to make sure. It's better to be safe than sorry.|`|0TCFrA7iaa	it sounds like a cold or small flu.
faea60adf3f7a07eeb307e36067f7830aa	When I was on progesterone, I experienced weight gain, a lot of hunger, and I was tired all the time.  It sounds like it could be the progesterone causing all these issues.  If you took a HPK and it was negative, you're probably not pregnant.|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Go see a doc and get a blood test, so you don't keep taking the pill while pregnant.|`|2zC1lpfVaa	It may be the hormone.  Why don't you stop taking those pill and just use condom in the meanwhile?
e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	It's not necessarilly that part of messing up for letting her sleep w/ you its being consistent with her new bed and sticking to it.  If you want her in her bed for now on do just that.  Make sure she isnt tired and if that's the problem maybe adjust her naps diring the day and she is active to be tired and ready for bed at night.  Then get her bathed, dressed for bed, read her a book and turn out the light.  Tell her its time for bed and its nigh night time.  Leave the room.  If she flips out go in the room, dont turn on lights or be loud.  Cover her up, tell her its time for bed and walk away.  Sit on the floor 5 ft away.  Make the distance longer each night.  Then get up and go to bed.  She will eventually go to sleep even though everyone lost their hearing from her yelling.  If she cries and throws a fit mommy and daddy are comign over.  Of course she's going to yell.  Your coming during her "call".  Keep reminding her in a calm way in the dark (maybe a night ligt kept on) and off to bed.  She will eventually outgrow it.|`|EUnx6Ncoaa	i heard you're supposed to let her scream and don't go to comfort her...i know its hard and after a few sleepless nights she will take to her own bed and feel comfortable there.|`|4iXL4C6paa	The reason she screams so much when she see's you is because she knows you will give in so you are just going to have to put her in her own bed and stick with it.  When she wakes up crying let your husband go and calm her down and after he tells her she has to sleep in her own bed leave her in her bed, it might take a little while but she will get used to it.....and you are not alone because my 26 month old is still in the bed with us :(, sometimes even the 3 year old lol.|`|x84MEAv5aa	Well, I think you have the right to Love your daughter any way you know how! It's ok that you let her "HELP" you through a very tough time! DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT! WE all do it with our kids at some point!<br>  <br>  I can say I did this very same thing. What you can do, Is get a small bed, put it in your room.. next to your bed if you can. start Small.. this is hard for a child her age to adjust!<br>  Then once she is ok with that  try to start having her lay in her room, Dont force her but let it be gradual!!!! <br>  <br>  I'm sure its hard, but you can do it... things like this take time!<br>  <br>  GFOOD LUCK TO YOU!|`|7euYlgjSaa	I think the best thing to do is leave her crying... Yeah I know it sounds mean but if you keep going to her, she is just getting her way. If its too much for you then spend the night at your parents house and leave your husband with her. Eventually she will fall asleep and just wait it out for a week and it should get better.|`|576c58b1fccb9ea8d4a8d4fcb2ec7f04aa	Oh honey, you didn't mess up. You went through a hard time and just wanted to show your daughter a little extra love. I went through this as a toddler, as many of my friends have with their children. There's really only one way to break this habit, and that's to get her a nightlight, maybe some soft music, and just let her be. Don't give in to her screams. Eventually she'll learn that that's the routine, and she'll stop being so difficult about it. And don't worry about feeling bad. I never hated my parents for it. I remember being very happy to see them every morning. Best of luck to you.  Hang in there darlin!!|`|ahSDb7Tzaa	you guys can probably go to vacation, maybe start in a house fresh with no problems built up inside that house let her know the rules of that vacation house and teach her that in this house we dont do that, then hopefully when you come back you have a long talk with her stating that all the rules you had to follow in that other house you have to follow now, and if you don't i am your mother and i will not take that as well as your screaming.|`|ocNUYENRaa	I have a brick wall hubby too :-)<br>  <br>  What I did to get through to him was show him numerous articles on the benefits to co-sleeping. Secondly - The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers is GREAT! It offers gentle advice for this transition. I got a copy out of the library and ended up buying my own. <br>  <br>  This is but a short stage in your daughter's life. Personally, I say cherish this time you can share sleep. Someday she won't need you as much. :-) good luck with it!|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I saw this on super nanny and the way she had to do it with her toddler, was sit on the floor until she falls asleep, and after 20 minutes if she still isnt asleep take a step closer to the door, still sitting though, and by the time you make your way to the door she should be asleep. When she wakes up screaming, you have to go back and sit all over again until she is back asleep, just as if the night was barely starting. Its going to be very aggrivating to have to do this in the middle of the night, but that was a decision you made a long time ago. Soon she will get used to waking up alone and she will be too tired to scream anymore. Just do it over and over again until it works. You never give up bc after she has cried for an hour, and you give in, all she has learned it that mommy just punished her for an entire hour for no reason bc she is still in the bed with you. Stick with it.|`|5ed83c89437f484069b18bb91d4b595daa	I have a four year old who without fail will come to me when he is ready for bed and tell me. " mom I need you to sleep with."  <br>  If he falls alseep alone, he will come find me when he wakes up.  <br>  I know he wont want to be this close to me forever. So I don't mind.<br>  It gets a little crowded however on the weekends when my 12 & 10 yo. also climb into sleep with us.<br>  If husband is having trouble with it, let him sleep on the couch until your baby is ready for her own bed... (ooops did i say that out loud? lol)<br>  <br>  good luck!
57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	Yes and yes.  My husband didn't notice a change in my smell, though, so I assume it was my sensitivity to smells that changed.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	just a little

skSzDIlwaa	7 days after you period is better cause that's when you ovulate.|`|hr24wI0daa	you technically can only get pregnant between 24-48 hours out of the month. When you ovulate. Sperm can live inside of you long enough to get you pregnant no matter when you have sex and no matter when you ovulate. Your ovulation usually occurs between 12-14 days from the start of your period|`|kT7GVOosaa	it is best when you are ovulating which is in the very middle. it is usually 14 days after your last period. no offense but if you didn't know about ovulation then your probably not old enough to have a baby,|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi,they say its easyer to become pregnant 14 days after the first date of your last period.This is around the time most woman ovulate.Good luck|`|AA12016833	ok lets say you have a 28 day cycle (day one being the 1st day of your period). To get pregnant you want to have sex right in the middle of your cycle ( right around day 14), which is when most women with regular cycles ovulate.|`|W1p6LetFaa	You get pregnant prior to or exactly when you are ovulating.  Every woman ovulates at a different time in her cycle, but on average about 14 days after the start of her period (so about 7-10 days after you finish your period).  If you have already ovulated, you cannot get pregnant.  So you are least likely to get pregnant right before you get your period.  However, if you ovulate late for some reason, you can still get pregnant.  So there is no "easiest" time to get pregnant because you can basically get pregnant at any time during your cycle if you don't know exactly when you ovulate.
uDl5lUtdaa	..I can't tell if this is a sarcastic question or not...but yes, it was embarrassing for me for a while.  <br>  (Especially when random people would come up and rub my belly...they were only trying to be nice, but it got kinda creepy at times. :) ) Then everyone just started being really nice to me and asking me about how far along I was and what I was gonna name her, etc.  I got over it real fast too, because I knew that I had to get my diploma for my baby so I could start college right after I had her, so I just had to start blocking other people out of my mind and focus on just me and my baby and trying to do what's best for her.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jelly Bean E:<br>  <br>  HAHAHA, WHAT?

We're not pedophiles or rapists or anything...and if you're still going to school even when you're pregnant, I personally think that's something to be proud of.  Haha, people like you disgust me. :)|`|r39EDGhPaa	It probably is.<br>  <br>  Meh.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	since i was the only one...yes a bit (and i know for a fact i was the only one pregnant)<br>  I didnt go to public school for every long considering i was pregnant with twins...so i got huge quick!<br>  But while i was there id get dirty looks from teachers, students and what not but i honestly didnt care...|`|hUdKYtegaa	it wasnt for me everyone said to me aww when are u due? u have such a cutee belly! but i was the captain of the cheerleading squad &+ most of the girls in my school were pregnant!|`|K6XZ18uHaa	depends on your school, if it is rare then obviously its going to be embarrassing and awkward.<br>  if your school is a "slut school" where many girls are pregnant then its easier to face.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I was never embarrassed|`|DNygQdmVaa	Not where i went to school.<br>  there was quite a few pregnant girls, we even had our own class.|`|TvYos4fhaa	School is more important depending on your situation. If you plan on giving up the baby for Adoption it's defiantly a good idea to keep going to school. I'm not a pregnant teen but one of my friends is and she still comes to school. She's been coming for 5 months now at the beginning she was embarrassed because she "looked wierd" but now she's living a normal life and when the baby comes it's going up for adoption<br>  <br>  --hope this helps|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	I spent my entire junior year of high school pregnant. It was a bit embarrassing at times. People I didn't really know would ask to touch my belly, I could hardly fit in a desk towards the end of my pregnancy, I felt like a huge cow, and basically felt like a sideshow at times. You get over it though,|`|AA11575450	Sure it is.   But you still go and knock out good grades and show everyone the great character you have.   You can still be a great success, a good role model, and be proud of yourself.   One mistake will not take us down!!|`|7nev9Jxiaa	ummm hells yeah....<br>  is like everyone is looking at u like you did something wrong....<br>  is horrible....<br>  well atleast some ppl confort you... even tho u know they talk about<br>  u behind ur back.....<br>  thats how u find out who u real friends are...<br>  when u giving birth, they'll be outside the room :]|`|aoGh9umlaa	hey jellybean F, giving life is NEVER a mistake!! no matter how young you are! and yeah it probably is embarrassing...|`|6TAp4PB5aa	as long as the school permit you to come in, then what the heck... if your concern about other people, then you need to live with it...<br>  <br>  <br>  watch juno...|`|aRRQrwd9aa	if i was a pregnant teenager, i would get home school!|`|9aIotOULaa	i saw a documentary and the girl got ridiculed and criticized a lot by students, teachers, etc.<br>  most of it is behind your back though|`|qBUD4xmoaa	NO who cares what they think anyway
TorfpKnDaa	It is the sperm that decides whether the child will be male or female. Male sperm swim fast but dont live for very long. Female sperm swim slower but live longer than the male sperm. If you chart your cycles and find out when you ovulate, have sex on the day you ovulate and the day afterwards, that will increase your chances of having a boy. If you want a girl having sex 2-3 days prior to when you ovulate will bring a higher chance of conceiving a girl.|`|udUzdU7Raa	There are ways (using IVF) you can choose the sex of your baby, however it is very expensive. Alternatively, there a Chinese calendars which show when you are most likely to become pregnant with a particular sex. It calculates it according to your age, the time of month, etc.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting your hands on one of them to time your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Its the mans sperm that determines the sex of the baby, so there's not alot you can do about it I'm afraid... Good luck with the TTC!|`|fMnzjULCaa	Go to webmd.com & register to create a pregnancy calendar. There you can either create a pregnancy or ovulation calendar. On the ovulation calendar you can select the sex you want & they give you the days & "ways" to try. Good luck!|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I've heard some people pay crazy amounts of money to "spin" the guy's sperm, which separates the X and Ys which have different weights.  I think I read there's something like a 80% chance of getting what you were trying for.  However, short of being rich and really caring THAT much, there is nothing you can do to boost your chances.|`|3xohBcdoaa	Please don't blame me if you have a boy! But my older sister told me that if want a boy, you would eat expensive foods. To get a girl, you would not eat that good of foods. I'm not saying to not eat poor foods, regular I mean, not high class food.<br>                                                                           Good Luck!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Although there are a variety of old wives' tales, having a boy or girl is a 50/50 chance.  Once the sperm meets the egg, the sex has already been determined and there is nothing you can do to change that.  Good luck!|`|zmpk29BLaa	smoke a lot of crack and drink Jack.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Alot of people dont know this but,..,., Its the man that gives U the sex of your child!
a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Some pout, others don't.<br>  <br>  I expect most of us, the spanked, do pout for a few minutes after, while the backside is still quite warm. <br>  <br>  But seems if I "pout", I am just extending the punishment.  At her age, it might not be surprising though hopefully you and DAD (the one that spanks) can let her know that both of you still LOVE her; just that the misbehavior needed to be punished.  Maybe gradually she will discover that she should learn the "lesson" that the spanking is to teach. And that beyond that, she misbehaves, she gets spanked, then she should "get over it" and get on with life.<br>  .<br>  She may be of a very sensitive nature. Maybe some method other than spanking would be more effective. Maybe you need a locked cupboard or somewhere to put confiscated items? With it just in yoru bedroom, maybe the temptation was too great.<br>  .|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You've got to stick to your guns and support your husband when he disciplines your children. (as long as it's not abusive). Because if you don't this can lead to problems between the two of you. And your daughter figuring out that she can get what she wants by going to you. And then she learns nothing because the consequences for her wrong actions are not seen through.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	I don't know what planet you're on lady, but your husband is abusing your child.<br>  <br>  I think your priority should be to put a stop to it. <br>  <br>  You say:  'she hates getting spankings from her father'<br>  <br>  This is obviously a regular thing.<br>  <br>  Get off Yahoo and protect your daughter.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Lol my son pouts if i look at him wrong, an knows exactly how to manipulate me lol.  He just got his DS taken away as well, i cracked an gave it back to him after a few hours.. i suck.  BUT im trying lol!!  I know its all about stickin to your guns!   She is mad at you because you didnt give in, and she is givin you the guilt trip lol.. i know it sooo well.   Good luck, i hope she thinks twice about lying next time :)|`|AA10598839	i'm not anti spanking for YOUNG kids after age 6-7 TOPS it is pretty much USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!. She is way way to old to get a swat on the butt. She needs to have a actual punishment like grounding no T.V no bike no phone calls and doing housework i make my daughter "who is 11" write 100 words out of a dictionary. I think a spanking should not even be a option for your daughter at her age. You and your hubby need to come up with a punishment that involves her DOING something like a chore or taking things away it is WRONG to hit a 11 year old.|`|P7BQOKt3aa	Spanking becomes degrading once a child becomes your daughter's age. She is likely embarrassed and angry about having her personal, physical self violated. I am not opposed to giving a toddler a swat on the rear, but this is an age that you are able to reason with. Skip the physical punishment or you are going to have major self esteem issues with this girl.|`|i6mydMOyaa	Obviously spanking isn't working. How about trying to be a parent by using parenting skills and techniques, instead or you and your husband being bullies. <br>  <br>  Take a parenting class. Your building a disturbing future.|`|QM7cAE4vaa	not so much hours later, only for a short amount of time right after.  Stay strong, it's hard I know.  It always hurts you more than it hurts them, but children who don't have limits can grow up bad.  I've only had to spank like  2-4 times total though, I yell mostly instead.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I used to do that. Try to act like you'll never forgive your parents then the next day you pass by Mcdonalds and you want a happy meal. It'll wear off.|`|1Dj3JVftaa	it is a fact that spanks do not "work" so maybe you should try to explain to her what she is doing wrong, why it is wrong, and find out why she did it in the first place. then you should put her in time out or ground her for a few minutes that equal her age (7 yrs old = 7 min). also you should  try hiding her game in the closet or somewhere she cant reach. this works way better than spanking and you wont feel so bad after wards either. i really hope you try this and if you give an update that would be great. i personally don't think kids should be spanked.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	You aren't going to like my answer but I don't blame your daughter.<br>  <br>  Spanking is wrong, point blank! You need to adjust your parenting styles and not let your anger get the best of you. There is a reason that spanking is 100% ILLEGAL! If your were in a custody battle and did that you would loose all visitation with your children. Take that into consideration next time you think about doing it. If your daughter goes to school and tells a teacher that you 2 are doing that, you will have Child Protective Services at your door.<br>  <br>  I was never spanked and respected my parents 100%. And I have a 4 year old who has never been spanked and is an angel (no I am not biased, all her babysitters and my friends and family praise about how well behaved she is) Do some research online about better ways to discipline your child, it isn't working for a reason. And you are loosing your child's respect because she doesn't trust either of you, and I don't blame her, you are physically hurting her!!|`|yrx6GxDcaa	I will just answer your question because your punishment spanking i do not agree with. I am raising my 3 granddaughters 5, 10, 14. My 14 year old has gone 3 days without talking to me when she has something taken away for getting in my face and screaming at me telling me to mine my own business a trait she learned from her mother screaming at her. This is another thing i do not believe in. But what you were asking stand your ground if you let her have her way she will learn that you can be manipulated and it will get worse. There are age appropriate punishments. If something bad ever happens are you going to listen to someone screaming  or are you going to listen to some one who is calm and assertive. Teach me it is ok to hit someone when they do something i do not like.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Yes this is normal it will pass soon ..<br>  <br>  <br>  JIM ..That is an excellent answer .. I applaud you ..I see you are becoming more mature ..which i must say is a welcomed relief :)
n53HeORBaa	children can get easily attached to their primary caregiver, try to be there for her always even if she doesn't want you too, it would hurt at first but then she would soon realize that you love her and she would cling to you and let you near her again|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Oh don't be so hard on yourself. Its probably just a phase. Guys have to deal with this all the time. Dads are usually on the opposite end. Its usually the mom that kids want and run to and its just a phase and they eventually grow out of the whole favoring one parent phase. Guys don't take it so personally usually. I'm sure its something she will outgrow. The fact that you became depressed and moody with your guys' second baby may have caused her to notice a change in you which is why she has clung more to her dad lately, but it won't stay that way forever. You may have to work more at it. Are you only trying to comfort her when she's hurt? Make sure you're trying to be lovey and affectionate with her at other times as well. Don't give up though. Try not to take it so personal. She's only 2 and really doesn't understand. My son is 22 months old and he sooo favors me over his daddy. If he's ever hurt, I'm the one he wants. If I'm holding him and his dad wants to take him, he usually turns away and says "no mama" and things like that but its nothing personal. I just happen to be the one that's always home with him while daddy is gone at work. He will outgrow that as he gets older.|`|77hZZZXvaa	I'm so sorry, that is very sad. I can tell you without even knowing you though that your daughter loves you. I do believe that even two year olds are very perceptive. If you have been depressed and maybe neglecting her a little, I'm not trying to be critical, but she might be going to daddy because he is giving her what you have not been able to lately. Pregnancy can be very difficult emotionally so i hope you will reach out for support. On the bright side you can ABSOLUTELY fix it! Try to be patient with her but just keep trying to be her mother. Make extra time for the two of you now because when the new baby comes it will be even more difficult to bridge the gap between you and your daughter. If you haven't already please talk to your doctor they can help you! You will be in my prayers, God bless you and your family.|`|DMTNTTKiaa	i think its just a phase and she will come over it with the arrival of the newborn.my son dosent like to interact with is dad on weekdays cause he comes home late but on weekends he is a daddys boy.....so we let him b wut he wants..children at timae cud b mischevious,so yr daughter must b having something in mind which i guess she will come over with time...so relax and dont worry..she is too young to hate you.<br>  and u r a good mom..u r trying so hard..isnt it?|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Now you know why they say daddy's little girl because they will go to them more.  She's two.  She cant stop loving you.  She just feels more comfortable with daddy.  Since she is acting a little sensitive about you vs daddy, encourage her to be better to you in a calm and nice manner.  If you react to her not wanting you she may do it to see that reaction not knowing it hurts your feelings.  Continue to love and support her.  She will come around.  My daughter is the exact same way.  ALL of it.  If he were to smack her bottom for doing something VERY bad she will hug him and say I know you didnt mean it, I love you anyway.  I put her on time out and she hates me.  She will hug her dad and look at me and smile.  She started that as well when I was pregnant with my second.  Now that my son is here she will still pick daddy over me.  The only time she picks me is when she's mad at him or I take her away where she wants to go.  She tries to play us to her advantage.  My son is a mommy boy.  He will choose me over daddy so we're even!  My son said momma before dadda, etc.  When waking from his nap he will come straight to me.  He only sits with my husband when I'm not there.  Just continue to give her the love as she needs and deserves even though you think she's playing you.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Yeah i agree with the above answers.. Dont let it get to you.. I believe kids tend to get closer to one parent over the other.. Maybe just take some time for just you and her out of the day and spend real time with her. Color with her.. get her to just focus on that time you and her spend together.. New baby brings alot of new feelings for EVERYBODY!! Just let her know no matter what and how she feels she is still YOUR lil buddah =) Good luck & God bless..
DcLiW4bbaa	There is a two week margin of error for due dates. Since the ultra sound puts the due date less than 2 weeks from the original, there's no reason to change it.<br>  <br>  But, by my experience, I would go by the ultra sound date. I was due by my LMP on 12/26/08, but the ultra sound put it at 12/18/08 and she was born on the 18th. :)|`|jwftwLBTaa	Ultrasounds are pretty much the most accurate at 18-20 weeks. To get your LMP due date, add 7 days to the first day of your last period and count back three months. Babies come when they want anyway, so 6-7 days difference in due dates is not unusual. You could be due April 21st, but not go into labor until the 25, 26 27 etc. it is a guessing game, a surprise. Due dates are to give you an idea of about when to expect Delivery!|`|cO9sxO9raa	We are totally on the same page! My doctor told me according to my LMP I am due March 31st, but when I got my ultrasound around 19 weeks they told me April 9th which sounds more accurate to me because my cycle isn't usually 28 days but more which means I ovulate later also. I am going by the ultrasound it just makes more sense to me. =) Hope your pregnancy has been going well and God bless. =)|`|AA10015577	I would go with the ultrasound EDD because it is more precise.  Going by your LMP is just a referral because some women don't ovulate EVERY 14-15 days or have a perfect 28 day cycle.|`|AA10478146	I'm expecting my first baby (a girl) any minute.  I was first told my due was 2/19 (yesterday) but, the many, many ultrasounds I've had have said 2/28 and 3/3 for a due date.  I may be looking at another week of pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  If this is your first baby, go with the later date.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	It depends on how early the ultrasound was. My doctor said later ones can be inaccurate as babies grow at different rates later on.<br>  <br>  Mine are:<br>  <br>  Early ultrasound- March 2<br>  LMP due date - March 13.<br>  <br>  We will see!|`|W1p6LetFaa	I had the same thing.  My LMP gives me a due date of Feb 23, but my ultrasounds gave me a due date of February 26 and then of Feb 20 (today).  I asked my doc which one to go by and she said to stick with the original one based off of my LMP.  She said they don't change the due date on my charts unless the ultrasound is off by more than 7-10 days.  Since your ultrasound is only off by 5 days, it's not significant enough for them to change it since both dates are only a guess anyway.  I hope that helped!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|kT7GVOosaa	the ultrasound will always be right. LMP is just an estimate until you can actually find out how far along you are.
28WJwHf4aa	Yes, he is still financially responsible UNLESS he signs away his rights. If he signs away his right to be a parent, then he is not financially or physically responsible for the child. He would need to see a lawyer to do so. <br>  <br>  This is permanent and not a choice to enter lightly. He cannot change his mind 5, 10, 15 yrs. down the road and demand to be in the child's life. That will be left up to the right of the mother, or the child when he or she reaches 18 yrs. of age. <br>  <br>  ETA: I have an aunt that delivered twin girls. She was a meth addict, as was the father. The father signed away his rights when the girls were born and has had absolutely no legal responsibility for them. I raised the girls until they were 4 yrs. old. <br>  <br>  And I live in Minneapolis, MN.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	A father can never just sign away his rights to the child unless the mother of the child agrees to it. And no mother is going to let a father off the hook that easy (unless there is another man involved ready to step in and adopt the child). <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but if she chooses to keep the baby he will be held responsible if she files for child support. He should be prepared to man-up and take responsibility for this child. A child needs more from a father than a bi-weekly child support check.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Well, I may be wrong here but I really don't think that something as simple as signing away your rights will get you out of paying child support.  If it was that easy then I'm sure there would be tens of thousands of men lining up to do so.  That may get him out of legally being a father but that doesn't take away the fact that he shares half of the responsibility for bringing the child into the world.  <br>  <br>  The simple fact is, he may think he is screwing over the mother by not giving her any money but the one he is really hurting here is the child who is innocent in all of this.  <br>  <br>  Go ahead and have him sign away his parental rights but I'm sure that doesn't get him out of his parental responsibilities.  There have been cases decided in both the US and Canada recently where it's been proven that someone was not biologically the father of a child but they are still held responsible for child support since they were the only person the child knew as a father and the courts didn't feel it fair that the innocent child suffer.  <br>  <br>  Speak with a lawyer.  Usually first meetings are free and they can tell you what needs to be done but it really doesn't make sense to me that signing away your parental rights would save you from doing whats right by the child.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	He is liable for child support, unless the mother decides to relinquish the child, or unless the state allows his rights to be terminated, because of a step-parent adoption. He cannot just sign himself away.<br>  <br>  There are reasons for termination, but avoidance of payment isn't one of them.<br>  <br>  Child support enforcement is a federal law.<br>  <br>  Minnesota has a long history of child support enforcement, in the cases of unmarried parents, going back to before WW2.<br>  <br>   Adoption is no guarantee of a better, more stable foundation for children. Adoptive parents get divorced(there is your child support issue again), go bankrupt, become alcoholic, abuse drugs, lose their jobs, and behave the same as everyone else, including abuse children...sadly.<br>  <br>  The child is his responsibility, no matter how he feels about the mother.<br>  <br>  this is very sad.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	He wants to get rid of his own kid to get out of being responsible for the living human he created<br>  <br>  I think mother and child are better off without him, whether he ponies up or not<br>  <br>  That's appalling.  He created a baby, he is responsible for that.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	No, he can't get out of paying child support. Thats ridiculous. If that was an option every other deadbeat loser in the country would be doing it. If she files for child support he'll have to pay it. <br>  <br>  The courts will NOT let him even try to sign away his parental rights to avoid paying child support. The answers saying its possible are totally wrong or misinformed. They only let you voluntarily terminate your parental rights if you're an unfit/abusive parent or you are placing the child for adoption. <br>  <br>  See this article- its a little long but has it all written out- they do not let you sign away your rights for anything but extreme reasons SPECIFICALLY so that people don't try to get rid of their responsibility to support the child. If he's so worried about the child being raised on welfare why doesn't he get a real job and make some money to support the kid? Adoption isn't generally in a childs best interest in this kind of situation, the parents getting off their butts and taking care of it is. <br>  <a href="http://www.divorcesource.com/MN/ARTICLES/beaulier23.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcesource.com/MN/ARTICLES...</a><br>  <br>  Eta- there are a few things in that article referring to involuntary termination when the parent refuses to pay child support. That only happens if the mother requests it and the judge agrees, like if dad disappears for decade and mom remarries and the stepdad wants to adopt the kid? Not for guys who just don't pay support for a while.|`|165WRAJdaa	Well he sounds like a winner. I guess he could terminate his rights somehow. I guess thats the real reason he wants the child to be adopted so he doesnt have to pay child support? <br>  <br>  Maybe she'll leave his name off the birth certificate and he wont have to worry about it. Of course a child will go through life without a father...|`|frpCK0utaa	He would have to sign away his rights. He cannot get those back at anytime. once they are gone, they are gone. <br>  <br>  What a winner*sarcasm*<br>  <br>  Even if he signs them away, i doubt the mothers going to change her mind. personally, i think you have a lousy friend. He should be ashamed of himself, making a child and not being a man about it. I hope he's not in your "potential boyfriend " pile. If so, id kick him off that list.<br>  <br>  ETA: stop acting like you know whats in this childs best interest. unless it's your child, you have no way of knowing whats best for this child. As you say, you need to see the whole picture.<br>  <br>  And Randys right, i doubt, know that i think, he can just sign away his rights.
AA10624857	Green leafy vegetables such as spinach do contain iron.  Most babies aren't big fans of spinach and it can be hard to prepare so it is easy for a 10 month old to eat.  If you aren't using an iron fortified cereal for your baby such as commercially prepared infant cereal or iron fortified breakfast cereals and she isn't drinking formula, than she can get iron from other sources.  Red meat and egg yolks as well as commercially prepared jarred baby meats contain iron.  Dried peas and beans (legumes) contain iron.  I used to give my daughter canned garbanzo beans at 10 months.  I rinsed them well then cut them into 1/4's.  She loved them.  Tofu and lentils also contain iron.  A 10 month old baby should receive about 11 mg of iron per day.  ADDED:  None of the foods you've listed are good sources of iron.  You may want to add some jarred baby meats or some egg yolk.  If he is eating iron fortified cereal as well as drinking breast milk or formula, than his iron needs are likely being met.  Cow's milk is low in iron and that is one of the reasons that it is recommended to switch to cow's milk after 12 months when the recommended amount of iron is reduced to 7-10 mg of iron per day.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	well if youre breastfeeding broccoli, spinach etc and red meats, chicken, beans, lentils<br>  for baby: good sources of iron are rice cereal, formula, chopped up pieces of meat etc.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	And dark green leafy vegetable has a large amount of iron in it.  Also a lot of legumes are good for iron. You can buy iron supplement drops for infants at any drug store.  However, you should check and make sure your baby actually has low iron before doing this because it is easy for infants to get iron poisoning.|`|QvoPb2SBaa	dark green veggies, yes. However, iron from veggies aren't absorbed by babies as well as from meat and breast milk. Red meat is a good source of iron too. Iron is better absorbed with vitamin C, so give him some juice along with meals if you want.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Dark green vegetables like spinach and broccoli is a great source. <br>  <br>  Another natural way to get iron (no pills) is actually red meat like steaks and such.|`|kr0IgpDeaa	GREEN PEAS WITH SOME CHEESE CAKE AND COFFEE XO
RPd66ldYaa	I noticed my son acting in similar ways (only wanting marshmallows and other junk) so I stopped buying it and that solved the problem. When he's hungry, he has to eat. Just remove the problem. My son is four also. :)<br>  I never buy him juice so he's not into that - I make smoothies sometimes and he likes them. Otherwise, He just doesn't have a choice - he has to eat and if his junk is gone he has to deal with it. On Friday's it is our special day so he can have candy and I have my soda then. Take care and dont worry - just be tough.|`|n53HeORBaa	try making the food look more presentable, colorful and fun, try making a happy face with the veggies and the food which you want him to eat, play a game with him telling him that he needs to eat the happy face so he can always be happy, eat with him, show him that the food is good, tell him after eating something like "yum yum..this is soooo delicious, then eat another one, he would be curious enough to eat everything at his plate, continue doing this varying the plate from happy face, trains, planes etc..until he is used to the idea of eating also visit your pedia for vitamin supplements|`|AFi5kTiEaa	My son is this way, he has oral sensory issues which makes some foods "grose" to him.  Its not that he doesnt want to eat good foods, he has tried, he just cant take the textures.  It makes him gag and when he does eat something like a grape it takes him 10 bites to finish it.  You can tell by the way he eats it is just nasty to him.  I have been to specialists and food clinics, he has gotten a little better but not much.  I have come to realize some food textures to him would be like us eating worms, he just cant and wont eat.  I try all the time to give him new things some he will try some not.  He is now 5.5 and this has been going on since he was an infant.<br>  <br>  Did he have reflux as a baby, some kids that had it have a hard time with foods.  <br>  <br>  The oral sensory is hard for most people to understand and it is very frustrating and difficult.  I worry about my sons diet every day and hope one day he will eat everything but i really have doubts.<br>  <br>  Just try and offer him the healthier foods he will eat.  My sons diet is waffles, bagels, toast, dry cereal no milk in it, but he does drink milk. crackers, pretzals  applesauce..  He does like some junk food but I dont give it to him.  I started giving him V-8 fusion, it has a serving of fruit and veggies in a serving  and he likes it.  Will he take the drinkable yogart, my son wont but you should try stonyfield farms is the healthiest.  I only give him milk, water and the v-8 fusion no other juice there is to much sugar in it.<br>  <br>  Good luck most people dont get it and it is so hard.  No parent wants there kids not to eat good foods.  it sucks!  and i tried from the beginning to make him a good eater, it just didnt work.  My daughter eats all foods so it wasnt me doing something wrong.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	My dad nicknamed my daughter Shorty Whose Pants are Falling Down.  She isn't particularly picky about what she eats but doesn't eat huge amounts.  I've worried too but the doctor pointed out that children who are offered healthy nutritious food rarely allow themselves to starve to death.<br>  For some good healthy recipes for kids, look at magazines like Parents or Parenting that suggest kid-friend recipes.  Encourage him to help you in cooking and preparing the food, if he's interested.  If you really are determined to get him eating healthier, it will be a battle at the beginning (just remind yourself that you are older and wiser than he is and are more stubborn!).  Look for some good recipes, simply refuse to give him junk and only give him juice a few times a time so he doesn't fill up on it.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	My 7 year old grandson is a very picky eater.  His mother (my daugther) lets him eat what he wants -- dough nuts for breakfast -- a soft taco for lunch.  He used to want a bowl of chili with crackers--but now he won't eat that.   His teacher would always be able to get him to take one bite of what ever they served at lunch --but at home, he would ask if he had ever eaten it before --and if the answer was no -- he would say "I don't like it".  He is much too thin -- hopefully he will grow out of that and begin to eat food offered.|`|wcdz3lIPaa	he'll eat when he gets hungry, my advice is don't feed him junk food until he eats real food first no matter what he does or says. make him sit there till he eats It will work. however if he seriously dont like something theres no need to force it but he will eat something im sure.|`|6de74b356349ac2bf37fa75df2cfa356aa	You realize that this is a power struggle and he is winning. Do not give in to him when he wants a drink. He is filling up with liquids and is not hungry at meal time. You are setting eating habits for him that he will carry into the future, so you want to set a good example. Make sure meals are at the same time every day, do not let him "graze" during the day. Have him help prepare a supper with his favourite foods. Fruit snacks have too much sugar. Do not worry, children will not starve themselves. He will eat when he is hungry. It takes 10 times of serving the new food before a child will try it. He has control over what he is putting into your body. Your job is to serve nutritious food. You do not want to create eating problems with your child. The hardest thing to do is to not give in to you child when they are crying, begging, etc. You have to stand your ground. He will soon learn that he is not in control and will begin to eat what is served.<br>  Good luck with this.|`|qaeDSFhbaa	Making the snacks nutritious and making kids eat them is hard, my suggestion is make the food look like something fun..like ants on a log, it's has fruits and veggies, and A lot of kids like to eat them. <br>  <br>  Another thing is to try making eating fun... ^^; Like make it into a game of him eating, like with babies and the airplane game..<br>  <br>  Here are some sites I looked up for you to try: <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/recipes/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/recipes/index....</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kidapprovedmeals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidapprovedmeals.com/</a> (scroll down for the recipes)<br>  <br>  Also, don't worry, it's just a phase, he'll get over it and grow into a healthy boy.|`|nnhPeNXbaa	wow..thats kinduhh bad, but my brother didnt used to eat meat or chicken, but now he does and he is six years old, but he started eating meat and chicken last year too :] anyways, uhmm..i dont know what to tell you besides that take him to a doctor and see what happens and what they sayy.! well i have an idea! but its nasty..here it is:put like all the fruits he likes to eat in a blender, with a little vanilla ice cream, and milk. blend it and if it helps! <br>  <br>  H0PE i HElPED : D|`|TqQcB2gWaa	Most kids are like this. It is normal. Naturally young kids especially toddlers Crave sugary sweet things, its a natural defense mechanism. Most natural things that are dangerous are bitter. Most natural things that are sweet are safe to eat.

I wouldnt be to worried about it. dont give his alot of options. if he wants the fruit snacks.. he had to eat his dinner 1st.|`|RZg3zNQoaa	If he is drinking alot this can often make you feel full, so i am not saying deprive him of fluids, but perhaps you could watch how much he is drinking. A 4 year old will almost always want to eat junk food over the food you dish out, but the solution to part of this issue is to just say no or dont buy as much junk food for him to have access to. If they are hungry it's almost necessary for them to eat (or at least try) the food you have put out. Do you include him in the decision making for dinner? I realise he's young, but perhaps if you showed him what you're going to cook, or said f"or dinner do you want option A or option B"- it might make it more appealing to eat since he chose it. I really hope it works out for you.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Prepare him good foods but mask them.  Cut up apple slices but put peanut butter on them.  Dip strawberries in yogurt or chocolate.  Make veggies and spray with a little butter.  Or coat cheese over it.  Continue to give him healthy foods like veggies and fruits.  Only give him the junk foods after lunch and nothing like that after dinnertime so the sugar wont get him all wired before bed.  <br>  <br>  So far I am fortunate to have two that eat well.  My daughter will be 5 in July used to eat really, really well.  Asparagus, Brussel Sprouts, etc. now wont eat that but still eats carrots, peas, green beans, brocolli, etc. Fruit, she loves it all.  She now doesnt care for a lot of meats that she did eat before.  Her appetite has changed.  I dont know if she now knows the difference in sugary junk foods and knows she doesnt like the dull food.  He will eat if he's hungry.  My brother in laws son will be 5 in June and he never eats.  He allows him to eat junk and never sit for a real meal at all.  He is very thin but he isnt starving.  Just be consistent and encourage him to eat the good stuff.  If he took 4 bites of the veggie then let him have one of the junk food but no more.  Also dont keep it out in plain view.  Put it in the closet or pantry on the top shelf where he cant see it if he were to get in there.
BUI9HnH1aa	12 weeks <br>  but it doesn't happen all that often <br>  im not sure what its called but  a big needle goes in ya belly to collect amniotic fluid to test for abnormalities ... <br>  they also use this test for dna testing ( paternity test)<br>  and of course u can find out if its a male or female from a dna test<br>  <br>  besides that its an ultrasound at 18-20 weeks|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	They can do an amniocentesis and find out very early in the pregnancy, way before an ultrasound would be able to. Depending on why you'd need one done, you could probably have one done quite early, but the risks of miscarriage at that point would be higher.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Ultrasound around 17-20 weeks. Or if you get an amniocentesis, that can determine the sex. What is the rush though?|`|nAOlBmzDaa	These are the most accurate ways:<br>  CVS - 100% accurate and done between 12-14wks<br>  Amnio - 100% accurate and done anytime after 14 weeks-I think?<br>  <br>  Ultrasound - 12/13 weeks "nub theory" is growing increasingly accurate<br>  Ultrasound - 14 weeks - toilet shots are pretty reliable if its a boy<br>  Ultrasound - 18 weeks + girl/boy over 95% accurate<br>  <br>  I just had an u/s done at 14wks 3 days and was told its a BOY!!! I believe it, so we'll see in a few weeks! Good Luck!|`|AA11764194	I found out I am having BOYS during my 13th week ultra sound.. that is the earliest I got to know.. <br>  <br>  I read about a new test kit (just like pregnancy test) to determine the gender at 6th week itself.. don't know how accurate it is...|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I had an ultrasound at 16 weeks to determine the sex of my baby,and they are 100% right!!!|`|C8E3fe3xaa	I've heard with a 3d ultrasound you can find out the sex sooner, but with just a 2d ultrasound they usually wait until around week 18-22 to tell you the sex of your baby. Good luck!|`|erKyfwSbaa	An Ultrasound. I think you can tell around 13 weeks.|`|oDlDrjF1aa	here is a website where you can buy a test <a href="http://www.intelligender.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intelligender.com/</a>|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	16 weeks<br>  <br>  better view of things at 18 -20 weeks|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	Ultrasound around 17-20 weeks|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Ultrasound 5 months prego|`|4QCYjPYhaa	I was 12 weeks when an ultra sound determined I was having a boy|`|K1MbAdsqaa	i've heard 17-20 weeks?|`|06qlDIrdaa	I had an ultrasound at 13 weeks and found out I was having a baby boy. It's rare to see that early, but that's what they told me! They just said don't go out and buy boy stuff just yet because there was a slight chance they could be wrong, but they'll know for sure at the next ultrasound which is on February 24th!
oT3d4Yu0aa	Trust me, I graduated high school last year and many people are afraid to ask questions in class including me.Even people in college are afraid to ask the teachers questions during class. That might go away but probably not. As for the handing in homework, I don't know about that.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	turn off the computer and ask the 8 yr old!!  start communicating with your child.|`|hChhOhOGaa	First try to ascertain why he doesn't want to ask a question.  Does he believe he will be ridiculed?  Does she make children who ask questions look bad in the eyes of their peers?  Is he just shy and doesn't have the confidence to approach the teacher?  There are many ways to empower your child.  Role play with him/her as if you are the teacher.  Let him/her know that the only way to understand things IS to ask questions.  There is never a bad question.  Maybe a sit down with the teacher is necessary.  Authority figures can be intimidating for young children, especially already shy ones.  Work on his self-confidence, teach him that to ask a question doesn't make you dumb, it makes you smart.  Good luck.|`|yrx6GxDcaa	It is a common thing among children this age and older it is nothing to worry about my guess is you were the same way or her dad was. Children mimic there parents behavior. My wife is very out going and can talk to anybody i can not. One of my children was very open, on debate team sat in front in every class always raised his hand to be called on. The other one was just the opposite sat in the back and never said any thing unless she had to. Every thing is about there comfort zone some teachers they connect with and some they do not. Ask her if she likes her teacher are does she make her uncomfortable.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	she might just be shy in front of the other kids or shy in front of the teacher u need to tell her that its ok to talk to the other kids(not in a bad way) cuz if shes shy she'll be that shy 4 the rest of her life shes only young so u can do somthing about it she'll be fine dont worry shes probally just going through some kind of stage of being shy it should fade away|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Sometimes when a student ask the teacher a question cause they don't understand they get scolded and told that they weren't paying attention when it was explained. This may not be the case with your child. You should set in on a couple classes and see how the teacher does in class.|`|xOYGzkSxaa	Although it seems plausible that your daughter is just naturally shy and just need time to grow into her own confident little girl. You should probably check into the teacher. Ask your daughter if her teacher is too mean. I've lived through such hardships in grade school where the teacher for some reason decided that I would be pestered by her and would then turn around and tell my parents that I was the best student she had. Go in one day and just sit-in in her class, and observe her. As a parent you have that right all you have to do is go put your name in the visitors binder at the front office and walk to the classroom.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	OMG!Its not just my kid,good to know.My kid is 8 and is the same way.|`|x0ERpUv5aa	yes it is very normal...i went though it its all about u being scared to be made fun of...

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay as a nurse I have to tell you, you need to make an appointment with your doctor  tomorrow. you health is not something for yahoo answers really. Goo get Checked only a doctor can give you the peace of mind of knowing you are healthy and all is normal or that you are pregnant. my sister had false negatives and a light period for the first four months of her pregnancy and had two healthy twin boys Lil. Go get checked better safe than sorry.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	That sounds like pregnancy to me! With my current pregnancy, I had VERY similar symptoms, without the spotting. I did spot a little after I had already found out I was pregnant. I was sick for one day, and then I took a test the next day and found out I was indeed pregnant! If it's what you're hoping for, than I pray you test positive! Take a test! If it's positive, then congratulations! God bless you and Good luck!|`|bef68894c6c158e56dfd305f51801d35aa	The best advice I can give you is to go to your Dr or the nearest Planned Parenthood.....even though if you are pregnant then Planned Parenthood will try to talk you into aborting the baby. usually if u overthink that your pregnant then sometimes you may see signs that really mean nothing.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	You could be prego but you may want to wait a little longer [til its been more than a few days that youve been late] to take another test|`|mqHL4UcRaa	That sounds like implantation bleeding. It occurs 7-10 days after unprotected sex.Implantation bleeding appears as light pink or light brown spotting and lasts no longer than 2 days. It's caused by a fertilized egg attaching itself to the uterus (thus making you pregnant). After implantation, your body starts to produce the pregnancy hormone. It takes about a week for your body to produce a high enough level of the pregnancy hormone to test for.<br>  <br>  Period-like cramping is an early sign of pregnancy as well. It's caused by the uterus stretching/expanding. I had period-like cramping 1 week before my missed period.<br>  <br>  Your mentioning pregnancy related symptoms that are not early pregnancy symptoms. You wouldnt have backaches until your uterus presses against your back (9+ weeks). Nausea (6+ weeks). Increased appetite (12+ weeks). Bowl movements tend to slow during pregnancy, and gas isnt common until mid-late pregnancy. In other words, you dont get all the pregnancy symptoms at once. It happens gradually over time as your body changes.
oYmZUO8Caa	Well, I don't know. A lot of people like presidential names - think about it - Madison, Reagan, Kennedy, Jackson. But I'm not a fan of a child being named Obama, regardless of my opinion of him.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	HELL NO! F*** OBAMA! HE SUCKS! SCREW HIM! HILLARY SHOULD HAVE BE OUR FIRST MADAME PRESIDENT. WE NEED GIRL POWER TO CLEAN UP THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW IT'S ALL MESS UP BECAUSE OF THAT BASTARD.|`|DP48dIxhaa	If your serious...then I would use it as a middle name! Oakes Obama seems cute for a little girl.|`|FsiG5WtQaa	If you really want to, then go for it. I suggest it for a middle name though.|`|UXxsDUECaa	The thought of someone who spells like that being responsible for a life frightens me.|`|KVcmTJ4zaa	why not?|`|h5cFkP35aa	They're hating because it's a stupid, ugly name.|`|bIMtnIcIaa	i think cus maby ur taking this a little in your head....GREAT CHANGE has come! and so will babys|`|nrGsxWw3aa	I think it is a strong name.
96HWpdkFaa	Maybe she's just having some lighter periods now. It's normal for the womens body to change. And sometimes lighter periods just happen!<br>  <br>  If your worried she can take a test to see if she's pregnant...to be safe.<br>  <br>  I think your fine.
CxRJwJsraa	before the famous Apple Martin, I had a friend who had a 3 yr-old daughter named Apple Lynn. I always thought it was adorable, and the girl was very sweet and the name fit her very well.<br>  <br>  The thing is...I really have a hard time imagining the name working after the girl is about 5 or 6. It seems eternally youthful. But, it might make a really unique middle name choice.|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like it.<br>  Reminds me of April, and that's a month, and Apple is a fruit, who cares?|`|t0mb150gaa	That is what Gwyenth Paltrow named her daughter...and no i do not personally like it and think the child would be teased. I mean remember in kindergarten when you are taught the alphabet...A is for apple...|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i love it. it's so unique and if it wasnt a fruit... i bet it would be a very popular name. i absolutely adore it!|`|igvUbqkyaa	If your name is Gwyneth Paltrow then sure.|`|w1necKzYaa	Stupid!! <br>  people that name their kids stupid things like that should be charged with child abuse!|`|CSysSbnlaa	Apple is a pretty and unique name. I wish I was named after a fruit or flower. I may also list:<br>  Willow<br>  Flora<br>  Gardenia<br>  Citrus|`|oYmZUO8Caa	It's unique. I don't love it, I don't hate it. You just have to remember that she will have that name all of her life - so just think about how you would feel if that was your name.|`|Uj1QQejQaa	She's gonna get teased.<br>  <br>  Kindergarten,A is for Apple.<br>  <br>  Middle name is good:)|`|pCbzhOrkaa	I totally agree with you! i find it adorable i dont know why everyone dislikes it|`|mHfACWezaa	If you like it that is what matters, But the child will get teased about her name when she grows|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I like it too, but I'd use it for a middle name. Not the first name.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	i really like it. its unique  !|`|BjDJfagmaa	Like others have said, I'd use it as a middle name.|`|yUFpAgtbaa	personally i think apple is a fruit name not a name for a kid<br>  but people name kids weird things all the time<br>  it is good to have a unique name verses one where you have to differentiate which person you are talking about when everyone has the same name|`|FZZTb7Y0aa	Gwyenth Paltrow  named her daughter Apple.<br>  <br>  I personaly don't think it is a awsome name. i have to agree with another answer. I remember learning the alphabet as A is for apple.....<br>  <br>  i would go with apple for a middle name.|`|mka6r0vaaa	I think that it is a cute name, although I'm not sure I would ever use it.<br>  Maybe the name Apollonia (ah-poh-LONE-yah), with Apple as a nickname...?|`|biKEQKlCaa	i'm sorry but i don't really like it. it is kinda pretty but i don't think i would ever want to be named after a fruit..but thats just my opinion.|`|4URp7Ew6aa	I don't really like, sorry if I hurt any feelings, but you might try it as a middle name?|`|Ezn3pe5Faa	I really like it. There is a girl at my school with that name and she says she loves her name.|`|UXxsDUECaa	I think it makes a better middle name.|`|EtmD50eDaa	Hmmm. Well it's different but it's up to you. The question is do you think she'll like it?|`|AA11608704	I think it is a cute name. I like Apple Blythe|`|Ds0PJ4RZaa	sry but horrible lol|`|H9o3jdm2aa	idk maybe kumkuat would be better|`|zw0YYjYKaa	i dont liek it at all.

d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	You will be fine.  What you are describing is the natural healing process.  The drainage you describe is normal serous fluid that is there as a result of the trauma to the tissue.  The brown area is the scraped outer layer of skin.  If it was infected there would be redness around the area, the drainage would have a foul odour, and the area would be overly painful.  It will heal up in a few days keep applying the neosporin.|`|AA12152549	Keep it as clean as possible.  This is the most important thing.  Ordinary soap and water works best.  Use the neosporin lightly and cover the wound with an appropriate dressing which you should change daily.  Make an appointment with your doctor right away so that he/she can examine the wound to make sure no actual infection is going on.  Do not delay this.  If redness and/or swelling develop and/or if the pain and soreness get worse then go to the emergency room to have this looked after.  The sooner this gets medical attention the better.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Show it to the nurse at school.  She'll tell you if you need to see the doctor for antibiotics.|`|4QCYjPYhaa	The puss is a sign of infection.  That should be handled accordingly|`|EiQtzZHPaa	you should show it to someone at home,if it is seirous dont use neosporin its for minor cuts and scraps you need peroxide|`|8mCZFINyaa	You have gangrene, your leg must be amputated.|`|YeyPROgAaa	Use peroxide to clean it out.<br>  It's that household stuff in the brown container.
Bw1h5xAcaa	It's not true for all babies, but there are definite trends that girls are more like 140s-160s and boys are more often 110s-130s. The thing is, this is based off of baby's baseline heartrate. You can only establish a baseline by observing the heartrate for longer than 10-15 minutes. A few moments on a doppler isn't good enough because you don't know if you're catching the baseline or a temporary acceleration or deceleration. That's why this prediction method can be very wrong for people. But in my career of monitoring hundreds of pregnant women, if you can catch the baseline heart rate, I'd estimate about 80% of the time you can predict the gender correctly.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Heart rate has nothing to do with gender; it does indicate age of the fetus though.  The younger (smaller) the fetus, the fast the heart rate.  My boy was in the 180's early on and down to 150-160's by birth.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Sometimes it can be accurate but not in my case. They thought I was having a girl because of a fast rate but HA it was a boy. Lol we did the ultrasound and he flashed his turtle every which way.|`|1o820L3Daa	Im having a boy, his heartbeat at 20 weeks was measured 159bpm. The sex of the baby has nothing to do with the heartbeat. Its a old wives tale.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Just about all those old wives tales say I'm having a boy, heart rate included, and it's a girl. So I wouldn't rely on that stuff.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	It's not true, i am having a boy and his heart beat changes everytime i get it checked..it's been anywhere between 135-160.|`|754f46072902dd5942d9978021c25003aa	Actually I just heard the same thing today for the first time.|`|VUKDrd2taa	Im having a boy and his heartbeat was 150 today at the doctor.|`|kVBDpAMTaa	I am having a girl and her heart rate is always around 140.
hChhOhOGaa	Maybe a second opinion on the testing.  Was he tested for Aspergers?  <br>  <br>  Asperger's Disorder is a milder variant of Autistic Disorder.   Both Asperger's Disorder and Autistic Disorder are in fact subgroups of a larger diagnostic category.  This larger category is called either Autistic Spectrum Disorders, mostly in European countries, or Pervasive Developmental Disorders ("PDD"), in the United States.  In Asperger's Disorder, affected individuals are characterized by social isolation and eccentric behavior in childhood. There are impairments in two-sided social interaction and non-verbal communication. Though grammatical, their speech may sound peculiar due to abnormalities of inflection and a repetitive pattern. Clumsiness may be prominent both in their articulation and gross motor behavior.<br>  <br>  Is he allergic to any food/medication?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Was he tested for epilepsy, oppositional defiant disorder, Leigh disease, Lesch-Nyhan disease...  gosh there are a lot of mild and not so mild reasons for that behavior.  What is unclear how bad he hurts himself.   Good luck, but I'd look into a congenital disorder that is metabolically based.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I would go to a different doctor.  It sounds like he does have some kind of an issue.  It is sometimes difficult to get a child "labeled" at a young age.  doctors dont want to label a child because the spectrum is so wide and there are so many different disorderes these days.  My nephew is 10 and just this year he was diagnosed.  It was obvious that he had a problem but it took so long for them to figure out what it was.  my friends son who in my opinion is autistic, flapps, no eye contact, brilliant, socially withdrawn and has ticks. has been to a nurologist many times but has not been diagnosed yet, he is 5.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what could be "wrong" with your son, I would go to different doctors and be agressive.  Tell them your concerns and you wnat answers so you can get him the help he needs now so he will be able to learn how to deal with his issues when he is older.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	I would get other opinions from other drs until one of them helps you.  This may be a phase but also something to not ignore.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Have you had his hearing tested?
GU3RauKOaa	Frankly, you probably have enough evidence to backup that fact that you are a good parent. before CPS comes have all of their report cards ready, any papers showing extracurricular activities, volunteering, gym memberships, anything that shows that besides caring for your kids you do extra activities with them. Make sure the house is tidied up and all that. They'll see that it is a safe environment for the kids. The next task is getting your oldest to shut up.<br>  <br>  You need to sit him down and explain that if he lies and says bad things about you that the government will take him and his siblings away and make them live in an orphanage or with strangers and they won't get to see you and your husband again. Even if he is angry now, that thought should scare him enough to shut his mouth. Don't worry, it will all be ok. He's not the first angry kid to lie to CPS, they won't take him away jsut because he says so. They will investigate and see that no harm is coming to these kids and leave you alone.|`|LMc23g9Maa	I think you'll be OK.  Let them know what happened, you might even volunteer the fact you agree to take parenting classes to deal with the discipline aspect of things, namely a sneaky child and it should all die down soon.<br>  Courage.<br>  <br>  I'd be furious if I were you!|`|MeYILJeSaa	I highly doubt you would lose your kids over this. If you did I would fight hard. That's ridiculous. I'm sure they'll investigate and find that's everything is okay. <br>  My 9 year old would be in for some severe punishment after pulling something like that.|`|zmpk29BLaa	I doubt it. If they investigate your house and talk to your other kids, im sure they will see that you are good parents. I'm sure they will take into account that they've been doing well in school too.. obviously if you make your kids turn in their homework then you are being a good parent.<br>  <br>  CPS is so busy that they don't do much unless its a CLEAR case of abuse\neglect.<br>  <br>  My best friend's mother has been getting into crack and stuff, and she just had a baby, so my friend (who is grown and out of the house like me) called CPS to report neglect for her younger sister... even in that case CPS hasn't been able to do much except randomly drug test her mom... which is sad, but it just goes to show that unless a situation is super serious they don't have the time\resources to do much.|`|nuTvB84Gaa	you never know.<br>  Try and be very nice to the cps investigator.<br>  If you've never had any previous calls or anything of that sort and you act very nice to the cps worker then you should hopefully be able to keep your children.<br>  And tell your 9yr old that he/she gonna have to leave you if she doesn't tell them the truth.|`|Qbu2Imqgaa	Don't worry. I have called dss because some one was clearly neglecting her kids and they have done nothing. That cop should have spoke to you...kids do strange things!!|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Well neglect can mean a lot more than feeding and putting clothes on your child's back. Are you sure there is nothing else that could be going on? Do you know what exactly your child said? Because usually a CPS officer is smart enough to know when a child is lying to get attention. I am not being rude at all, and I don't think you will lose your children over this, but it is more than not feeding your kids that they are concerned about. There has to be more going on here, or a lie larger than you know being told. I hope all goes well.|`|rqJSk1omaa	It sounds like you got a lot going on in your life and you were especially under stress and there is no need to make any excuses. I don't think that you neglect your kids nor do I think that they will be taken away but I do think that you should look at this situation as a sign.<br>  <br>  Maybe you son is has a problem that need to be addressed. He might not be totally happy just because growing from a child to an adult is hard. Maybe school's getting hard, he's getting erections, and he doesn't feel that he can confide in you about everything anymore. <br>  <br>  If hes lying and acting out try getting a psychologist for him to talk to. This would be a person, trained in how children think and feel that he could talk to about once every two weeks. He could tell secrets to this person, work though problems and let out some steam.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Nail the kid to the wall.  Point out the serious repercussions of his lying, and make sure he knows that he has majorly screwed up.  When CPS shows up, be polite, answer everything honestly, and do not volunteer any information.  Answer the questions, period.  Do not give them anything they could potentially use against you.  And whatever you do, Don't say Kids will be kids.  That implies you are not taking your son's actions seriously.  I would get this kid a therapist.  If he is creating this much trouble at 9, by the time he is 16 he will be serving life at the state penitentiary.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	If you can, talk with your oldest child and explain how serious this situation is. You can explain that you really need them to tell the truth. I hope everything works out for you! If you have done nothing wrong, then you have nothing to worry about.
mbprjCSiaa	*Mrs. Cullen 1 it was obviously an accident dogs get out all the time so calm down <br>  <br>  i think you should Take the dog to a vet you never know with dogs whats going on. best of luck|`|EMKuBql8aa	Wrong section, I suggest posting this in the dog section, this is for human babies, lol.<br>  <br>  Take her to the Vet, none of that sounds normal to me. My family bred Husky's and so I went through this a lot, it isn't normal, take her in something isn't right. <br>  <br>  Post in the other section, somebody elsewhere might know more. Good Luck|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Try the pet section. This is for human babies!|`|frpCK0utaa	This is NOT natural. No siberian husky should only weight 38 pounds. get her to a vet right now!<br>  <br>  ETA:to the folks asking how he could LET that puppy get hit. All it takes is one second of inattention, and the dog could bolt for the street. even the puppies are fast.|`|cb8FYxpuaa	i would be concerned i dont think thats natural for a husky. <br>  <br>  i would go see a vet to make sure.|`|4FR9d17Xaa	i would be concerned. Take her to the vet, there may be more wrong with her than meets the eye.|`|Bj3FedIcaa	I think you should try taking her to the vet. If she's depressed, it could kill her because she won't eat. Try to get her to play with the other puppy. You try and play with the puppy in front of her so it makes it seems like fun. Then maybe she'll start getting up and moving and eating again.If that doesn't work, i'd go to your local veternarian. :) Good luck!|`|ib8ovOxUaa	I think your dogs depressed, if so, call the vet. no matter what, EVEN if you think it's natural you should call the vet. it's better if you do that than waiting too long and your dog could get worse. don't ask us, trust your instincts.|`|qfBxQHCUaa	Why did she have puppies at a young age anyways? <br>  Is she being feed right?|`|osBdgA5yaa	I think you should get her to the vet. That sounds really bad, falling out in clumps, personality change. <br>  Depression?|`|QkOeODxLaa	go to a vet... AND HOW COULD YOU LET THE DOG GET RUN OVER?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  YOU SHUD NOT B TAKING CARE OF PUPPIES
2jMFurDoaa	if you have had sex you have the chance of being pregnant.<br>  take a test<br>  and if its negative..take your pill everyday AND use a condom<br>  if its positive then congrats mama.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	What matters is how often you took the pill prior to the unprotected sex. It's 99.9% effective if you have taken it everyday for 7 days straight. Once you miss a pill, you want to use a backup method of birth control for the next 7 days until you get back on track with the birth control again. I wouldnt worry too much about taking it a few hours late. <br>  <br>  You could be pregnant, there is always that chance. Even if you take your birth control religiously, you could still get pregnant as its not 100% effective. However, in your case I doubt it.|`|8a553a06ec63d3305f06ba0fe0b74456aa	No one on here can give you the exact chances of you being pregnant. There are different chances every time. One time you could be fine the next not. You need to find a more effective way of keeping track of taking you pill or a method you would be more likely to follow if you don't want a baby. I set my cellphone to remind me every night just in case I lose track of time. I usually remember but it is nice to have a reminder.|`|HO9RGUx9aa	use a condom or pills
pLD3pYsuaa	I really like Lexia Adelie and Harlow Adelie I think these are beautiful names and these names are unique which makes them more beautiful|`|cTk9nbvRaa	My favorite names from your list are:<br>  Jazline Adelie nicknamed Jazz or Jazzy!!<br>  Lexia Adeline nicknamed Lexi or Lex<br>  <br>  Very unique names by the way!

I dont like Adele spelt Adelie it sounds totally made up and the correct spelling is Adele.  Zaelee and Jazline are the worst. I dont like Lexia or Teagan either. Zaeless and Jazline are not real names I`m pretty sure. I prefer Alexia (Lexia as a nickname).<br>  <br>  I love Harlow Adele it is absolutely beautiful.<br>  <br>  Write back with the one you choose!|`|pNpcSmLvaa	- Teagan is super sweet and unique!<br>  I love the name Addison Renèe or Addison Paige : )<br>  Reagan or Teagan Adelie are nice<br>  <br>  I would call her Addison Paige/Renèe<br>  Or from those : Teagan Adelie|`|ZafHCbQbaa	I like the name Lexia.

aqto0hJTaa	OK, but I love you . . .|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Like the others said just tell her you still love her and give her time to cool down. It's kind of like a bad habit and it hurts but know they don't mean it. Give them some space until they aren't so angry then talk to them about it. What you said hurt my feelings etc etc. Try to give them a different phrase they can say when angry to let you know to back off for a bit.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Depends on age...but I'd have to agree with the first answer.  Just remind  them that you still love them.  Or as my family would do, guilt the crap out of them.  Tell them how much it hurts your feelings etc.  (I grew up with a lot of guilt, but I rarely said things like that)  <br>  <br>  They probably saw this on TV, or heard it from another kid.|`|Chib4b8saa	Give them a big hug and tell them you love them. If it continues though, I would consider getting him/her checked by a psychologist. The child could be suffering from depression.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	The discipline would depend on how old the child is.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Saying they hate you is not something you punish them for, thats silly|`|S1V47cPUaa	I hear that almost every hour of every day. I tell him i Love him and when he's done being mad he tells me he doesn't mean it (even though i know that) it's really hard to punish your kids when they are in that kind of a mood when you find an effective method i'm all ears!|`|WTv4e753aa	I used to tell my parents I hated them when I was angry. I never really meant it though.<br>  <br>  Don't take it seriously. It's just something they say when they are angry. I think all kids do that.<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  <br>  My website on bedwetting <a href="http://bedwetdaywetsupport.com" rel="nofollow">http://bedwetdaywetsupport.com</a>|`|mtOVRAnbaa	I agree with the first answer.. My 2 1/2 soon to be 3 year old daughter tells me now that she hates me and doesnt love me anymore evrytime she is frustrated and i just reply with a simple "well i still love you" and it seems to chill her out =)|`|juXQJJrXaa	MY DAUGHTERS USED TO DO THIS.. I WOULD SIT IN THE FLOOR AND PRETEND TO CRY.. ASKING,, WHY DO YOU HATE ME?  MOMMY LOVES YOU SO MUCH !!  USUALLY THEY FORGET WHY AND COME TO NUTURE MOMMY!  ITS REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY!  MY DAIGHTERS NOW ARE VERY AFFECTIONANT AND CARING AND ARE WONDERFUL NURTURERS.. TRY IT!|`|xt7xuvj8aa	Usually they don't mean it, and eventually they will come around and understnad how important you are to them, and how much they need you.  I would scold them, and review my parenting skills.  <br>  <br>  -L8THGRADER :-)|`|1qxhPyXzaa	My son went thru this.  I told him that I knew he was mad and trying to hurt me, but I loved him more and more everyday and that it was enough till he was ready to love me too.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	sit them down and explain what hate means they dont know how much they love u and how much u love them so dont be too cruel be kind and gentle

ZejwYamhaa	Film studies and Drama :)<br>  if you had to choose one though i would go with film studies because as well as the acting side to it, you produce your own videos and write scripts and stuff. <br>  As well as choosing a school course join a theatre group outside of school and get an agent. A agent will get you to audition for advertisements and stuff like that which will help you for your later goals. <br>  Also take English Literature at school.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	dram <br>  or film studies <br>  <br>  I would say drama.|`|0cM2pYk2aa	Acting<br>  Digital Media<br>  English<br>  Journalism<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  OH!

aYCjy8Neaa	Ultrasound is complete safe if done by and OB or certified stenographer. The only time they are unsafe is if they are done incorrectly and for too long of a duration. They say that it can heat up the abdomen and cause the fetuses body Temperature to rise if done for too long or if done incorrectly. But as long as you have it done by someone who is certified it's fine.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I know, my mom told me the same thing. They say that it might somehow bother the baby but they can't really prove if it does or doesn't. But looking around... all women have it done and no signs of an u/s making babies sick or cause birth defects so I say it's safe until they prove it otherwise :)|`|LKIhUMCgaa	no, ultra sound is nothing but sound waves|`|K5TrkUhCaa	No, it's safe to have an ultrasound during pregnancy. If it was not safe then doctors/ultrasound techs would not perform them on pregnant women. Millions of women get ultrasounds everyday for pregnancy.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	they are completely safe. i get one EVERY time I see my doc... and he's the President of Ob/Gyn's in my state, so i think he'd know!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i don't mean to repeat the third poster, but they wouldn't perform them as they do if they were harmful to babies.|`|lzUF22l0aa	if they were unsafe i do not think that they would perform them everyday everywhere. Good luck with everything
eV5E9MhUaa	Your probably pregnant, take another test. If that comes up negative but still no period, go and get a blood test. Good luck... if you need to talk to anyone you can email me. If your not pregnant... always use a condom or get on birth control.|`|1audzkx6aa	Yes you can, take a test|`|272YIuvHaa	If you let him ejaculate inside you, you could be pregnant. The first sign you could be pregnant is a late period and if you're late, then take a pregnancy test or request a blood test from Planned Parenthood. Your symptoms could be signs that your period is coming, but to be honest, most pregnancy symptoms are similar to those. <br>  <br>  I don't think that you're pregnant if he simply penetrated without a condom. Penetration and ejaculation are two different things.|`|xY0iRgqSaa	well when you tested it was too early. and it sounds probable that you might be pregnant. i would test again if you haven't started within a week or so. good luck.|`|PYafv6gSaa	you can be pregnant|`|zF1MRdUFaa	can be signs of getting a period or being pregnant take another test.

lzUF22l0aa	my personal experience i had a girl my first and i do not know what im having now.. that looks like a boy to me. How far are you and what did they tell you, you were having?<br>  it is to early|`|puCOYwMmaa	Boy?  <br>  <br>  They said I'm having a girl and there was absolutely nothing between her legs so I'd guess that's a boy.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I would say it is a boy.

But, maybe I'm wrong... In my (one time) experience, I'd say boy! That's my final answer! :)
SJx9IWWtaa	I think its influence from society AND that parents are busy trying to be their childrens friends instead of their parent.  <br>  <br>  I don't blame TV, but there are definitely some shows that show children disrespecting their parents, teachers, etc.  And kids see this, and see that people are laughing so they think its a good way to get attention.  But TV doesn't cause bad kids.  Mine watches the Simpsons, as did I when I was a kid.  But we are there watching with her, and she knows its just TV and what manners she should have in real life.  <br>  <br>  Then there seems to be this growing concern for EVERYONE to control when and how a parent raises their child.  We of course have the spanking war.  To spank?  Or not to spank?  CPS is getting called every time a kid gets disciplined for throwing a fit in public.  Some parents are out right scared to do anything about their kids behavior anymore because the police might get called.    <br>  <br>  Or parents want to be their childrens friend.  Because for some reason they think the poor kid won't love them unless they buy them everything they want, let them stay out all night, and do whatever they feel like.  :/  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong.  There are a lot of GOOD kids out there, but I'm starting to think societies need to say what a parent can and can't do to raise their kid will be the end to well behaved children.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It's not just nowadays.  There have always been and always will be kids who are out of control and others who are fine.  Every generation thinks the generation after them is worse off than the one's before it, but for the most part it's not actually true.   <br>  Of course, if you were a VERY young parent maybe you could ask your parent's why they didn't have control over you.|`|asTtNyTxaa	You said you were a young parent and you "think" you had control. Nice joke, the way you fool yourself is what keeps you thinking you are better than others. Can't wait until you grow up.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I think it is lack of parenting! A lot of people want to be their kids best friends rather then their parents or the fact that it is easier to just let them do what they want. It irritates me!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	People are LAZY. Being Lazy is the answer children don't bring their home work. Being lazy is the reason you forget to take your pills. Everyone is so lazy.|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	maybe you had proper care when you were growing up. these other kids probably are coming from a bad home...you never know what the reason is!|`|AA12012816	I think Chris above, goes towards answering the question.  There was a cover story on Time Magazine about a year ago, covering this point.  The percentages have gone up, especially in the UK<br>  I notice the television characters do tend to dislpay these sort of values and problems, but in a way focusing on problems, not on solutions<br>  <br>  My friend was helping to run a course for tteenagers, where they were asked 2 things:<br>  what do you think your parents want most for you in the world?<br>  A. To be happy<br>  Is it possible, that you being unhappy, may be a way for you to punish your parents?  <br>  <br>  People evolve:  They get to have boundaries as a baby, until they get responsibility enough to be child, adolescent and then young adults.  Being out of control is really sad to see.  It is sometimes the flip side of the discipline/freedom debate<br>  <br>  Find the Time Magazine article, or see specific courses which may help - why do you ask the question?|`|BRpzCFQlaa	I notice that a lot nowadays too. I'm a middle school teacher, and I do not remember kids being so disrespectful when I was in middle school. I''m only 24 years old by the way, so it wasn't all that long ago. I think it has a lot to do with poor parenting and horrible media influences, plus an overall lack of personal responsibility. The lack of responsibility it a direct result of the poor parenting though. I can't tell you how many times parents have made ridiculous excuses for why their kid cussed me out or didn't do their work.Kids just learn that they can do what they want and there are no consequences and now we have out of control youth. There are still some good kids out there, don't get me wrong. But that's why the bad ones are the way they are.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I feel like it is the lack of discipline, I have 4 young children and they are well behaved, of course they have there bad days but they are good children, I feel like alot of parents let there children get away with way to much or feel too bad when they discipline them, or some parents even think the bad behavior is funny or cute, and then they wonder why there children are out of control.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	I hear this quite often, but I don't personally see all that many "out of control" children when I go into public - at least, not any more than I saw when I was a kiddo.  Even the few I do see, it may be that the child is just having a bad day.  Maybe it's not always that it's bad parenting but the fact that there are people who judge parent's every move and make them feel uncomfortable to discipline in public.
WlU3NFu6aa	doh<br>  *slaps face*|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	no, she is not!|`|x84MEAv5aa	Not unless you had Sperm on your finger.. that was Fresh!<br>  <br>  If she thinks she is pregnant, get a test, or take her to a doctor for pete sake!|`|DTPERfnBaa	im only 15 and know that the answer is no you dumb ***. if you dont know you shouldent even have sex.|`|KQU5y20waa	ask a real question......|`|dNlCfhD2aa	no|`|Y1npBMS0aa	****! her baby is gonna be a finger! **** go get a pregnancy test!|`|aw348uOzaa	No if you don't even know this you shouldn't put your finger up your girlfriends ***
bP5zyipXaa	your not pregnant your stressed and stress effects your period try to relax|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	You didn't get pregnant from the sex if you took the morning after pill correctly and it was only 10 hours later.<br>  <br>  The morning after pill is a very strong dose of hormones for your body.  Its very hard on your system and is known for causing menstrual irregularities. So don't worry about it.  You might just feel guilty from having sex and that's why you are worrying about being pregnant.  No worries there.<br>  <br>  However, consider getting on a regular form of birth control.  The morning after pills is something you should only take once every 5 years or no more than a handful of times in your whole lifetime.|`|1KPYHLcFaa	I don't think you have anything to worry about, I've been there too, the morning after pill acts like a whole pack of birth control pills at once and pumps alot of hormones into your system your cycle gets really out of wack, it can be that way for about 2 months after you take it, until your system settles down again.|`|NWvLUIugaa	Because you took the morning after pill it can mess with the menstrual cycle because it is effecting your hormones (i think this is right). Or something of this sort so your period may come a few days to a few weeks later. I would call the place where you got the pill and ask them.|`|h5cFkP35aa	CM is right. The morning after pill messes with your horomones badly and forces your body into an early period. It may be off for some time and if the test came up negative you should be fine. Just give it some time to straighten itself out and USE PROTECTION.
fQLeIAh1aa	I had one in 2005, my husband and I were trying to have another baby and we went to the doc, hcg was high, had the ultra sound. They told em it was almost like the baby's cell just grew too fast and the baby died because of it. Another told me it wasnt even a baby but just cells. My belief is my husband fertilized the egg that created the baby even if he/she did not make it so yes, it was a baby. The next day I dont know if it was stress or timing. But i started to misscarry and had the d/c any way. It was heartbreaking. I didnt even know i was pregnant yet and when it was confurmed I was soo happy. Tehn i got a call from the doc adn they thought soemthing was wrong and it was. But i was told it is a 1-1,000,000 chance of happening. I had never even heard of it. But now we have 3 healthy kids. I am sure  you will too. If you ever want to talk let me know.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I've never had one but I read up on them...<br>  I'm sorry this happend to you..when a women finds out she's pregnant she usually imidatly falls in love with the baby and this is very sad.<br>  But A molar pregnancy isn't really even a baby. The reason you feel like you are pregnant is because it produces the same hormones as pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry. You will concieve again..keep patient and have faith. God has a reason for everything.<br>  <br>  <3|`|PAdif484aa	This link might help: <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/molarpregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...</a><br>  <br>  I am so sorry you are going through.

MeYILJeSaa	I think it would probably be fine. <br>  You know how on meat it says "use or freeze by"? I would think it's like that. Lol.<br>  Also, are you putting it in a deep freezer? It's only good for 6 months if you put it in a deep freezer.<br>  In a regular freezer, it's good for 3 months.|`|nyuB4POqaa	I think it's okay to put in the freezer, as long as it was only in there for 3 days. I used to put my milk from fridge to freezer quite often. Just check the milk just in case to see if it's still pretty fresh|`|mgtTMhLraa	I would just use it, would put it in the freezer. Its recommended that you freeze right away. Another thing, my milk only stayed good in the fridge for 3-4 days. Every woman's milk is going to be different. Make sure you check before feeding.|`|AA11979442	You can move breast milk to the freeze up until 7 days from it being in the fridge. Once you freeze that is when the clock starts. Just remember it is 3-4 mo in a regular freezer and 6-7 mo in a deep freezer.|`|u3YMCNLKaa	I would say if it's already been in the fridge for 3 days not to freeze it.|`|9EmOuiovaa	3 days might be a little long i think 2 days top before freezing/feeding is best. better to be safe than sorry.
KDb96QS7aa	I used it for both. I didn't want to be inconsistent. That would just confuse him - rocking to sleep sometimes, going to sleep on his own others.<br>  Ultimately you're trying to create a new sleep association (crib=sleep) and you can't really do that without being consistent.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	If you are going to use then you need to use it all the time. If you only use it sometimes then the baby won't be getting the "point" of CIO.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"CIO" was intended to be a way to force infants to sleep through the night before they were ready to do so. It was not designed to be a blanket permission for parents to neglect their babies for naps as well.<br>  <br>  Not that it hasn't been done. See <a href="http://www.truemomconfessions.com/confessions/tmc249323717" rel="nofollow">http://www.truemomconfessions.com/confes...</a> for one account.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	No, I just sit with my daughter until she falls asleep, then I leave the room (for nap times).<br>  <br>  At bedtime, she falls asleep in my arms while having her bedtime bottle, then I lay her in her crib and leave the room.  <br>  <br>  She is 8 months old.
sLkruqYVaa	So about the first issue i wouldn t worry , the right potty training age varies between 18 months and 3 1/2  so you still have another year before u start to panic lol, Do you have a holiday coming up, even if it s in the summer( in fact the summer is the best time to potty train because they can run around in knickers and vests so less washing for you).You could start the potty training at the start of the holiday so you d have a bit more time,the older they are the easier it is anyway.<br>  And as for issue number 2, i don t blame your kid, public bathrooms are pretty scary, i m sorry i can t think of a magic solution for that one it s an illogical fear that all kids have (monster under bed type) all i can advise is to perceiver every time you re out take her in the public bathroom or get your wife to, and hopefully she ll soon realise there is nothing to be scared of|`|DwFDF0A2aa	Unfortunately your wife needs to get on the potty training at some point.  I would suggest a rewards board with stickers on it for every time she goes potty on the toilet.  At 2 1/2 I would suggest that she takes her to the potty every hour.  If she is scared of public bathrooms, start her off on those travel potties.  Those are great little handy inventions.  That way she'll be familiar with it and you can take it with you where ever you go and she won't have to use public restrooms.  Eventually, you can bring the potty in a public bathroom and slowly get her used to them.  This potty can be used at home and in public.  The rewards board can make potty training a fun experience.  It can be a reward as little as "a walk to the park" or a healthy treat.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	I totally agree with the sticker rewards, treats, any kind of positive reinforcement that will make her want to go.  However......kids will go when they are ready.  If it works, great.  Introduce it, be consistent with asking if she needs to go, but dont force it.  She will go when she is ready.  Potty training is a control thing with kids. <br>  My son is three and just decided that he is ready.  I have been doing this for over a year. <br>  Keep doing what your doing.  Your wife will do just fine.  Your daughter will go when she is READY.  Don't worry, she won't be 5 and still not potty trained!  :)
WGAFP6mSaa	Oh my, I haven't heard about this, let me research it up right now.<br>  <br>  This is so sadddddddd.
BoXYiQIraa	My daughter does the same thing since birth and she's 7 weeks old now. It's probably gas! When my daughter starts kicking and kneading her feet in me when laying in bed it's a sure sign that she has a gas bubble. Try to burb her or you can use Mylican drops from the grocery store. That usually helps my daughter out a lot if it seems like she's having a tough time getting the burp. good luck!|`|j6dNwOPVaa	She could be hot, cold, or just plain bored.  Try dressing her a little cooler or warmer depending on how she's dressed now.  I would also try a bath and just let her sit in there and soak for awhile, baths truely do wonders with little babies, it reminds them of being inside their mommies.  Babies tend to get fussy over the littlest things too, like I said, could be bored or could be something as simple as a tag on her clothes bothering her.  I hope this helps you...if all else fails, call the hospital.  Is she running a fever?  Crying like she's in pain?  All questions to consider... hope that helps you somewhat!|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	depending on the age of your baby theres different things you could do i think you should try wrapping the baby tight in a receiving blanket and try rocking her while walking around and just talking in a calm voice. if that dont work maybe if you layed a blanket on the floor and put her on her stomach and put your cellphone in front of her...my son always stopped when igave him my cell phone.|`|ZnLBBOQeaa	I am a mother of 4 children, and i have had allot of those nights.  Have you tryed just some luke warm water in a bottle and than burp her.  She could have an upset tummy and the water will help.  How old is she?  If old enough could be teething.  My other suggestion is tryin laying down with her on your stomach and rubbing her lower back.|`|AA10716847	sounds like gas do you have any gas meds for her i have one with the same probs good luck and try the gas meds wont hurt her|`|LrBCJ8Graa	you should put some calm music on|`|HclKftzAaa	is she teething? unfortunately babies just sometimes throw their routine out the window. <br>  <br>  But sounds likes she's teething if she's fussing all about the place.|`|wRsSodTAaa	I have heard if you put a clock that "tick tocks" near her bed, it reminds her of her mommy's heartbeat and helps her sleep.  It will take her awhile to get on a schedule.|`|rb8OGnmZaa	Sound like baby may have gas pains.  Cuddle your baby and walk till she falls asleep.  Good luck.|`|pJ7icz0taa	Maybe she has a tummy ache.  Try warm water in her bottle drop a little juice in it.....try burping her.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	Mylecon drops( for gas) plus make her room dark calm and soothing.|`|o5I4pxlwaa	sorry.i can't help u.<br>  i also don't know what to do...
XXUNdEuUaa	they r both beautiful names but yes, i think they are too similar|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	yea there are very similar names<br>  <br>  its up to you to use them <br>  <br>  but they are too close, both have K L and the sound ee<br>  <br>  but they are pretty names maybe you can use one of them as a middle name like London Keely|`|Am54a7c0aa	Yeah, they are too similar for siblings.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Kayley and Keely are too similar to use at sibling names.|`|dvw0Ui9Laa	those are adorable names...<br>  but yes they are too similar for siblings..<br>  why about Kylie?<br>  thats not as close and yet still cute..<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|TCNDX14Daa	I think there way to close, the kids aren't going to like that in the future. trust me I know!|`|7uznrLBXaa	They are very similar.  They both (1) start with "K", (2) have an "l" and (3) end in "y".|`|sIqzhWMLaa	Yes, I do think they're too similar.<br>  <br>  What about Kayla & Layla?<br>  or<br>  Laylah & Kaylee?|`|dAgtW3G0aa	Yep they are too similar, I know a Kyle and Cole who are twins and they're always answering to the wrong names because they sound similar and people are always asking "so which one are you" and they arent even Identical twins people just get confused because of the names.<br>  <br>  Kayley is also quite overused and Keeley is a little more unusualy how about using the Alexandra as the other first name with the nickname Lexie, lexie and keeley sound nice together.|`|gZdpYcVvaa	You're an idiot, and the only person who would think it's a good idea is somebody who calls themself sweetie pie nightmare with a picture of vampire fangs. Name them something normal or they'll resent you for the rest of their lives.|`|IcXXJNPJaa	Yes, they are way too similar.<br>  People like their friends, and teachers will get them mixxed up all the time.<br>  And you will from time to time too.|`|kaHvWfwhaa	Too similar for siblings!|`|nf6aqR1Haa	I think their too close, I love both of the names though.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Yes they're very similar. Maybe you will like one of these...<br>  <br>  Kayley and Kirsten<br>  Kayley and Kenzie<br>  Kayley and Kalina <br>  Kayley and Kimber<br>  Kayley and Kelsey<br>  Kayley and Kylie<br>  Kayley and Katelyn<br>  Kayley and Kendra<br>  Kayley and Kalista<br>  Kayley and Krysta<br>  <br>  :-)|`|fboC1N7gaa	They are a little too close. What about kaelyn (kay-lin) and Keely or Akeelah and Kayley?|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Yes, I personally think they're to close and knowing me, I'd get frustrated with it.<br>  But, they are "different" names I guess, but they do sound awful close.<br>  ?<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED.|`|AIJgbvIcaa	I think they are too close. The main part of the name sounds the same when said out loud.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	yeah i think they are too similar.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hi there, yes, they are too similar (sorry) if you want my opinion on which i like better, i say kayley...very pretty!!
qUOaE4uLaa	the healthiest thing for your baby is to wait until she comes on her own. I am currently due on Monday and beleive me I wanted to induce too until ppl started telling me that there can be complications with inducing and especially early. Just wait at least until AFTER the due date. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|aTyNsdApaa	I was induced with my first at 39 1/2 weeks. My doctor and I were worried that she was getting to big and he said I could have gone another week or two. It was so nice. I loved it and hope to get induced with this baby. I got to call my whole family and tell them the big day. I went into the hospital  at 8  in the morning had my bag of water broke, an epidural, and 6 hours later a healthy happy baby in my arms. She had a appgar of 10 when she was born and weighed 8 ibs. I loved it.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	I was not induced with my first born, but the Dr did say I could be, but I was scared because it was my first and didn't know what to expect, so I waited it out. My second born, I was induced almost 2 weeks early and it felt SO good to get her out!!!   I was SO uncomfortable! I am only 5 ft tall and had a 7.6 lb baby! If she'd been in there the 2 extra weeks till her due date I think  my body would've fallen apart! LOL  but it was also nice to be induced because I didn't have the stress about worrying about where I would be when my water broke, or racing to the hospital while in labor, and all that surprising stuff!|`|01f0dac47a423ecab2421c4e39d16905aa	Only be induced if you have to.  Let nature take it's course.  My son had to be induced because he is a hard headed and wanted his mommy.  He had nearly no fluid left.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  We went to the doctors after staying up all night and straight to the hospital.  He is a mommas boy now but loves his daddy so much and we love him.  He is wonderful.  Just let your baby choose that day.  That final exam will let you know about the fluid and if your baby has enough to survive.  If not then let it be.  Your doctor if they are good will schedule you accordingly.  Don't let the short term negate what might effect your baby in the future.  You just stick it out girl.  You can do it.  You are a wonderful mother so far just a few weeks more.  You can do it.  I have no doubt and I don't know you.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	No being induced is really horrible.<br>  My sister was induced with her last baby, they did the gel thing where they stick their hand right up and rub this gel on your cervix which is supposed get it to dialate.<br>  She said it never worked the first attempt and she was so sore already but they had to do it again - very uncomfortable, she said the second time it worked and the contractions came out of nowhere and took her breath away before she even had a chance to realise what was going on.<br>  If you are not in any danger with your pregnancy and you have no real reason to have it early than i suggest just letting nature take its course.<br>  Goodluck with whatever you decide though.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	well you still have about a month (4weeks) until she should naturally come. I know the feeling. I am 34 wks right now and I'm thinking this baby has to be a goo 62lbs for the amount on discomfort I have. lol. I would wait until you hit 39wks and think about it then. Can I take 1+ week? Or should I do it now.... I was began induction with my daughter on my due date and started having my own contractions after my water was broke so I didn't even need to be induced. I am pregnant with my son right now. I think I'd like to go a little earlier with this one if I have a choice. It's your choice. Whatever you think your body can handle. Good luck and congratulations!!!|`|AztPvbauaa	I'm 36 weeks four days just like you.so eager to be done with the pregnancy and meet my little boy.initially contemplated induction until I got educated on the effects.just hang in there Hun.she'd definitely come when she's ready|`|nyuB4POqaa	I wouldn't get induced, she'll come when she's good and ready.|`|aZ2siUcfaa	I would not be induced. The least amount of interventions with your pregnancy and delivery, the better. Interventions pose MORE risks and MORE problems to the NATURAL process of childbirth. Let your baby girl come out when she is ready and when your body is ready to deliver her (delivery takes both you and baby working together to come out!) I would only ever be induced if there for sure was something wrong with me or baby to where he/she would need to come out immediately. Hang in there! It'll be worth it!<br>  <br>  Breeana (Cody S's wife)|`|Si9hhcW1aa	I was induced with my last child. It was not as bad as everyone told me it would be. I was miserable and everything turned out okay. Good luck!|`|uQc4UA2Caa	I HAD BACK PROBLEMS BEFORE GETTING PREGNANT IM NOW 29 WEEKS YES I WANT TO GET INDUCED I WAS TOLD MY GIRL MIGHT ARRIVE EARLY BUT IF SHE DOESNT I WANT TO BE INDUCED AT 38 WEEKS. I DONT THINK MY BACK COULD HANDLE ANY LONGER THAN THAT. <br>  IM ALSO EXTREMELY AGAINST C-SECTION AND EPIDURAL SO I DONT WANT MY BABY TO BE HUGE.|`|4rV15ZYuaa	Nope, would not be induced. She'll come when she's ready :-)|`|QwHHmJohaa	I had to have c-sections with my last two kids.   The recovery period is much longer and painful than natural.  Also both of them had breathing problems, as I have been told is very common for c-section babies.   <br>  <br>  Also, being induced is MUCH more painful, cramping wise than natural...  I worked in a hospital, and we were actually told to warn the patients before they were given the option of inducing. Going the good old natural birthing route with a partial spinal block is usually the best route for healthy pregnancies.|`|QluBTwCvaa	My understanding is that the longer the baby stays inside the safer she is. A full term baby is 40 weeks. The baby's lungs need to develop fully so she can breathe well. Your discomfort would mean nothing to you later if you did not give your baby the best situation and there was a problem resulting. I do not know what 36/4 means.|`|irGE84Qdaa	i,ll chose natural birth i will not like to be induced i m right now 38 weeks and 4 days but i,ll wait till 40 weeks if i have to i,ll wait for 1 more week and if not then i,ll chose induction when its need its not safe enough hun.<br>  good luck|`|jYPeis3Saa	no i would not be induced., <br>  <br>  its only a few more weeks until you are due. the longer the baby stays in the better
692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Sounds to me she has an insecurity an may feel guilty for leaving him with you so much, so when she is in public she makes up for this insecurity by trying to act like an overprotective good mother.  This may cause alot of problems in the future as the child gets older and becomes more an more clingy with you.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	sounds like she needs to woman up and take respons. for her and her baby. you arent doing anythin wrong and its her fault if the baby becomes more attached to you more than her,ive seen it done. and it also sounds like she isnt much of a friend if shes doing this to you :|
mGCYkqXNaa	When I was pregnant (at 6 weeks) I had VERY heavy bleeding for 10 days straight. I went to Planned Parenthood (at the time I didn't know I was pregnant...they were of no help at all) and it was so bad, when she was "examining" down there, she RAN out with the thing still in her hand to the microscopes (and then blamed the bleeding because I was wearing a pad....yeah, dumbass, I put the pad on after I started bleeding!) Sorry, I could go on all day about the horrible Planned Parenthood <br>  <br>  It turned out to be a threatened miscarriage I was having. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I ended up miscarrying at 11 weeks. (I had a teensy tiny bit of brown spotting for 2 days prior) I didn't get any medical help when I had the threatened miscarriage. Only 30% of people having one actually miscarry. <br>  <br>  So there's my experience with it. Sorry...that probably doesn't help you any....I feel bad now
Y3DR1EBUaa	I agree with you totaly & besides the older the are the greater chance of a baby getting  down syndrom or something... not to make you feel bad..|`|AA12226162	its your life sweety do what you think is right.  if you want to get married first then get married but lots of people in love and live together have kids together|`|oHNrktxTaa	Honey, that is a question that only you can answer. <br>  It is difficult for me to tell you, when you should get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Have you talked to your fiance about the situation of trying? If you talked to him about it, than he might give you a better idea of when to try. <br>  You are NOT old. There are tons of women in their late 30's even early 40 who are pregnant & giving birth. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you def. have this conversation with your fiance first.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you!|`|HU30GRn3aa	If you both are in a strong relationship then it's considerable..it's something you two should go through with. BUT with today's economy make sure that you both are financially stable enough to do it. Don't worry about being older or whatever I've known people that have had children at an older age and are fine. My aunt had her 8 year old boy, my cousin, at the age of 36. She is still running around the house with him..outrunning him even :)
oHNrktxTaa	Day one begins with any initial sign of blood. It is considered a period. <br>  <br>  Good Luck & BABY DUST!|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Well thats the same question i wanted answered. I tend to get brown stuff when my period is due and i wanted to know which day do i count as day 1,but i read and heard from websites and ppl that its when u get the blood, good luck baby dust  2 u|`|YLXpwqceaa	Day 1 is considered the day you get any types of blood.  Full blown period, bloody discharge (could be brown even), spotting, it doesn't matter.  Count that day forward!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|5tp4c1TEaa	I was told that cycle day 1 was the first day you had a full flow of blood, not just spotting. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|Jswomud7aa	Cycle day one is the day you START your period which means any sign of blood whatsoever that doesn't have to do with a trauma or injury.|`|nzGdMWbZaa	When you initially notice blood is considered the first day of your period.
HclKftzAaa	yes it is normal. Women go through the whole spectrum when they are pregnant- some can't get enough sex, and others wish they didn't have a vagina for now.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could still help him release his sexual tension by masturbating him etc?<br>  <br>  I am not often in the mood (thank goodness i am sometimes!) but i try to make the effort to make love with hubby at least once a week. Because i want to want sex with him.<br>  <br>  Do you at least wish you did want to have sex with him? Cause if you do, then you can work on it. But if you absolutely don't want to and don't wish you did want to- i think he's going to have to go without.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	Aww hun that is fair enough, I was horny like crazy with my first child and second but came the third and I didn't want a bar of him, pore bugger but I would try to set the mood and have fun with him and once I got into it, it was fine. Very normal hun.<br>  Congrats and good luck.|`|kBqxRuPLaa	Yes i'd say it's normal. Women's hormones and emotions are so up and down during pregnancy, it's CRAZY. While some women feign for it, others are disgusted with the idea. I didn't want sex either around your point, I felt so uncomfortable with my body and just wanted to lie around and eat! Lol. Don't worry, love! Congratulations though!|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Yes its totally normal. I went through that with my first pregnancy. Just the thought of my husband touching me would disgust me. I felt so out of whack! But when he did set the mood I would get into the swing of things. Now my second pregnancy was totally different. I couldn't get enough of him. Lol.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Yes my first pregnancy i felt that way. Like ugh I just was like nope. But this time I could care less either way. So yes its normal|`|ktOoGh6oaa	GIVE THE POOR MAN SOME|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	yess totally normal .<br>  i went though that stage ealier in my pregnancy<br>  all of a suddenn your gonna want sex
Jswomud7aa	17 and 19 are your best bets since you usually ovulate 14 days after the start of your period. Sperm live 3-5 days and Eggs live 12-24 hours. <br>  <br>  If you experience any sypmtoms of pregnancy it wouldn't be until about 10 days after fertilazation and that's a BIG IF, most don't start feeling those symptoms until about 5-6 weeks pregnant. <br>  <br>  Take a test around the 26th, but don't be sad if it's negative, just re-test again after you should start your next period if you happen to be late.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!
Yyqhbyoiaa	The only thing you can do is go get a check up at the hospital.<br>  I was 34 weeks when I went into pre-labour and went into full labour at 34.6 weeks. It started off with b/h contractions so I thought nothing of it but still being 34 weeks you don't want to put baby at risk.<br>  <br>  I was loosing discharge for weeks and it was sometimes clear, yellow and sometimes little tiny streaks of blood.|`|atmDaT61aa	If you have a bladder infection it would hurt when you urinate

ggfE4rlvaa	It just means she's done being sick and now her lungs are cleaning out. Nothing you can do unfortunately, just let nature take it's course. Had the same problem with my daughter, and in a day or 2 after the "nasty guck" started to come up, she was clear. Good luck!|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	You can purchase a humidifier. That is suppose to help clear up congestion. Be sure her crib, or where ever she sleeps, is not next to a window. The cold night air will only aid the phlegm, as well as dry air.<br>  <br>  I do not own a humidifier, but whenever my baby is congested and I hear phlegm in his throat, I will give him a long bath with the window and door closed. Soaking in a very warm bath in a room full of steam really does the trick for him.<br>  <br>  If the phlegm is really a problem and is not going away, you can ask her doctor for some medicine. There is a medicine (they are drops) that he can prescribe that helps clear away congestion.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	I don't think there is much you can do about it. Whenever my daughter had a cold, she if she was phlemy enough, it would make her cough.  You just have to wait it out. Sometimes it takes awhile, even maybe a couple weeks to get rid of the last of the yucky stuff! I know babies sound horrible when they get the slightest cold, but there's not much to do about it!!  One time my daughter had a cough and stuffy nose kinda cold and her stuff nose turned into a runny nose that lingered for like 3 weeks after her cough was gone!!|`|u3YMCNLKaa	Put a humidifier in her room at night. We have a cool mist humidifier that doesn't get hot so it's safe for her to be around. Just be sure to put fresh water in it and change it out daily, because otherwise mold could grow even if you can't see it and get into the air. Try this for a couple of nights to help loosen u the plegm. You could also turn the hot water on in the shower and just sit in the bathroom with her to breathe in the steam. Good luck!|`|OWkKgSPjaa	There are two solutions: 1) She might vomit it out. So when she vomits, that's when it will come out. 2) Give her drinks that are not sugar to increase the phlegm. Water and milk, for me, is a solution to that with my children and nephews and nieces. This might not work for all kids, but it did for mine.|`|9EmOuiovaa	there is not much you can do about it but do try to give her a little more water to drink and that may well help a little
Wzws8v8daa	no... it's all about clitoral stimulation|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Hitting the uterus is near impossible unless you are extra long. And if you are that size trust me a women wouldn't prefer that. It's too painful.|`|9X09kM4oaa	No, I don't. Size doesn't matter. Its not the size of the wave that matters- its the motion of the ocean (lol I know thats corny)|`|jkDbDjcRaa	If you're trying to conceive?  Or just in every day life?<br>  I think it's subjective to each woman.|`|oybsfVqPaa	I know some girls that feel it intensifies the feeling, but honestly.. It feels like bad cramps or gas when it happens to me. :) I just want to slap him if he does it.|`|kvCa4xCmaa	no, it hurts when you hit our cervix. but it does feel good when they go deep but not just bang out my cervix|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Um... not.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Guys really think that matters ...At least most girls I talk like it easy and slow and oral....The other stuff is ok but not too deep THAT HURTS!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Not if you are pregnant! Ouch!
oHNrktxTaa	Sore breasts can be a symptom of ovulation which depends on the length of your menstrual cycle. It can also be premenstrual or pregnancy symptoms. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between the two. <br>  The best way is to wait as your AF gets closer. The HPT may not pick up on pregnancy yet, because your HCG levels may not be high enough. When it gets closer to your period, I would retest early in the morning. Your urine will have the most concentrate in it.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you & BABY DUST!|`|YLXpwqceaa	The only time my breasts ever hurt was when I was pregnant...the only time.<br>  <br>  Mine hurt so bad that my husband would have to take my bra off because it would hurt for me to reach back to unhook it.  And even then I cried.|`|k9LLMLp3aa	wen my breast did dat it was because they were growing.maybe thats wat is was.
ynAXDyQDaa	I choose to not use tanning beds because I don't think a fake tan is worth getting skin cancer. My mom got skin cancer from tanning beds.<br>  So if you really think it's worth it, then go ahead.<br>  Just stating my opinion.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Personally I don't like mystic tans they look pretty obvious. It depends where you go for the cost some places have you pay by minute packages some you can buy weeks or months so you can walk in and pay for each tan as you go. If you aren't tan now and haven't tanned before you'll want to start in a level 1 to build a base tan. Starting at 5 is a good time and you should go every other day but everyday won't kill you. I used to go for 2 days then skip a day because your skin needs time to repair. If you want to get dark fast get something with a bronzer in it. It'll give you a darker look immediately because of the pigment. There are multiple steps of tanning lotions but make sure you get one tanning without a lotion is bad for your skin. I would say get a bronxing lotion with 2 or 3 bronzers in it. But they can be pricey sometimes more so then the tanning package itself. Use that everytime you go tanning but not on your face, get a different lotion for that as your face tans different than your body. Don't forget eye wear most places won't let you tan if you can't prove you have goggles or stickies to cover your eyes. Start building up your base tan by going a few days at 5 minutes then go up 1 or 2 minutes. The max you can do in a level 1 bed is 20 min, or 15 minutes if the bulbs are new. Within a few sessions you'll notice a change in color but if you turn pink even the smallest bit stop going until the pink is gone burning your skin is bad, burning it repeatedly is dangerous! Ask the tanning salon you choose for their advice as its their job to know what their doing. If it seems like they can't answer your questions sufficiently then go to a different salon. <br>  A tip for buying lotions: buy your package one day and see what lotions they recommend for you then go out and see if you can buy it or something similar online or at a beauty supply store. Tanning salons jack their prices up a crazy amount and I've used some "off brands" that worked better than their brand.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	do NOT spray tan! I did that for winter formal and i was ORANGE! You have to be albino or you will be orange I'm not even kidding! There are high power tanning beds that u can go in like 4 times and be tan by the dance. The lady that worked there told me. Star for you for saying my real name(Sadie)<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  Ahh i forgot to star! But i just did, and i go by mercy lol|`|6yZuB1wBaa	mystic tanning- its hard to say if it will turn your skin orange. maybe try a lighter color. <br>  i would stray away from tanning beds. if you want to keep your skin in good shape.<br>  so go with the spray tan.|`|Nau1lEy7aa	Tanning beds take alot longer.<br>  Just go get a sray tan. Sometimes they can look blotchy or really orange, but hopefully the place you go to knows what they're doing.|`|ibOD8ggDaa	use a tanning bed they take about  15 to 20 minuets i forget how much they cost though sorry|`|LORh42ICaa	i go tanning and when i first started out I needed to be tan for an event. If you prefer Spray Tan then do the one where they personally spray your entire body. It will look good and real. IF you do the machine that tans you it comes out  horrible. Im not quiet sure of the price. If you do the bed on your first day do 12 min on a medium bed, second day do 12  min, skip a day and do 15 min, then finally skip 2 days and do 15 min on a higher bed. you will have the perfect tan that you want. It costs be like 11-14 dollars each time i go, depending on the tanning cream you buy there.|`|al4qc3Ywaa	if u get a spray tan ur gunna look orange

jYPeis3Saa	generally any smart doctor would not schedule a c-section unless it was medically necessary.<br>  c-sections are not fun. they are major abdominal surgery and it can take a while to feel "normal" again. i however felt completely back to myself within a week. (had an unplanned c-section)<br>  <br>  if youre worried about your husband being away or moving when your due date is close ask to be induced which i am against unless medically necessary, but its better than a c-section.|`|V7sfV5odaa	To many If's...

I never had one, but I have compared my recovery (natural vaginal) to friends who have had c-sections. I wouldn't recommend it unless it was medically necessary. You could schedule to be induced early if you were close enough to the due date, and your doctor did some tests to make sure the baby waas okay to come out!  I'm sure it will all work out though! Don't worry about it!|`|85pp4KGiaa	you probably could depending on the doctor you see. BUT* keep in mind that things don't always work out as planned. You could have it before you are scheduled. You can NEVER tell anything about your pregnancy. It is a day by day basis.

Believe it or not, you like him.|`|816cUTbuaa	duh! you like him. that's obvious.
7VJcd5YLaa	It is either the latch, a yeast infection (I had 3 while nursing - it felt like my daughter was a piranha - she had no signs of thrush at all), or could be the start of mastitis.<br>  <br>  Being that it is not as sore when you pump could be that it is a latch problem.  Sometimes one nipple is shaped a little differently, the baby eats more aggressively on one side, is positioned a little bit differently, etc. and it puts a strain on the nipple.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you go see a lactation consultant ASAP, they will watch you nurse, help with positioning and latch and be able to help if it is a yeast infection or the start of mastitis. <br>  <br>  Two things that I swore by that eased discomfort were the lanolin cream and believe it or not - cabbage leaves!  You put the lanolin on your nipples and it is safe while nursing - it is very thick and can stain, so wear a breast pad when you put it on - and don't worry about washing it off before feeding - it is safe.<br>  <br>  Now for the cabbage leaves - get a head of cabbage and peel the leaves off and put them in your veggie crisper - when your nipple hurts, take a big cabbage leaf and wear it under your bra.  It will soothe instantly - I know it sounds strange!  When it is wilty, just get another leaf and do the same.  This advise (and a few heads of cabbage) came from my lactation consultant - she takes heads of cabbage on house calls with her!  There is something in it that is healing.  Give it a shot!  I would have given up many times if I did not have this secret - and we nursed for 2 years successfully.|`|IGcS9K62aa	It's probably a bad latch. Try another position on that breast (football carry). Make sure the nipple is getting past her hard palate. Try squeezing the breast making it more narrow as you pull her toward your nipple (get as much of the breast as you can in her mouth). Also, once she's latched on use your finger to pull her jaw down--getting her mouth opened wider. <br>  <br>  Infection is a possibility. Try getting a better latch and see if it persists. If so I would see a DR. But since the pain is lessened when pumping, it's probably the latch!!!!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It very well could be her latch. You may also have a little crack or the start of one. try some Lansinoh (or other breastfeeding/nipple cream). It's safe for the baby and will help you. Also when she's done nursing make sure you dry your nipple completely before putting it away. That will also cause cracking.|`|gK7kuyQqaa	My nipple will be sore to if someone suck on it for 7 weeks. I'll say thats normal.|`|AA11371251	it's the way your baby is latching on try laying her a different way while breast feeding and that might help!|`|Y9qhkO1faa	I hope this doesn't gross you out, but quite often an infection (like mastitis or a yeast infection) causes salty tasting breast milk. If you taste just a drop, you should be able to tell. If not, most likely the problem is that your daughter isn't latching on. My guess is, that it is some sort of infection if it is only one breast. If you weren't getting a proper latch, it would probably be both sides. I know it sounds weird to taste your milk, but it works. Google "salty breast milk" and you will see I'm not crazy. It's a whole lot faster than waiting for a doctor's appointment.|`|pZg05uygaa	If your nipple is still really sore after 7 weeks of nursing, there is probably something wrong with the way your baby is latching on. Instead of sticking the nipple in her mouth (which is a common mistake), tickle her mouth with your nipple until she opens very wide, and then quickly pull her onto your breast so that she has all of your nipple and areola in her mouth. <br>  Try this website: <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/basics/latch-resources.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/basics/...</a><br>  Seeing a lactation consultant is one of the most helpful things you can do. She will be able to look at your baby nursing and help you improve the latch, look at your baby's mouth and see if anything is going on there that causes pain.<br>  Use lots of lanolin.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Ok, I'm using my husbands account, so sorry about the name!  LOL!  I don't want to freak you out, but if you are having a "shooting pain" you could have a breat infection called mastitis.  Speaking from personal experience, I had a really cracked nipple when I began breastfeeding. Well, apparently bacteria from the baby's mouth got in the crack and caused the infection.  When I had it, I would nurse my baby on the good breast and pump the infected one so I didn't lose my mile supply on that one. Keep an eye on it, you may need to go to the doctor and get an antibiotic, but don't worry. you can still breastfeed!  Hang in there!!!|`|a5c553f88ddc5e6ae111a11b956e0d57aa	hello, I just had my baby 1 mo. I .The only time it hurts is when she has an improper latch, i also have a fast let down and sometimes my nipple slips from her mouth after a sucking Noise she makes ( repetitively) which hurts when she sucks nippl back in her mouth. <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/sore.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/sore.html</a> this link should help a lot. Traumatized nipples can readily become infected with bacteria or yeast, delaying healing and causing pain even when positioning and latch-on are corrected<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVFebMar00p10.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVFeb...</a><br>  hOPE IT helps, don't worry it can't hurt forever.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	shes not latching on properly, try different positions plus apply lanolin cream multiple times a day.  I applied right after each feeding and whenever I felt that it was not on anymore.  Don't stop nursing on that side.  It will make your milk flow less.  If it becomes unbearable, pump and nurse on the other side double.  like left left, then nurse right.|`|nyuB4POqaa	That's normal, but you should probably check to see if your daughter is latched on properly, sometimes that can cause quite a bit of pain if they're not. Also, try some PureLan cream for your nipples apply after ever feeding if yo uwish. Helps wonderfully :)|`|6zeZwQL6aa	It could be the latch.  When she's sucking, are her lips touching your areola?  That's the correct position.  If her face is too far away from your breast and is just grabbing the nipple, that's painful.  7 weeks is a long time to still be in pain though.  If she's latching on correctly, your nipples should've toughened up by now and gotten used to the sucking.  <br>  <br>  My nipples were extremely sore the first month.  The pain was sharp and it hurt like mad when my son latched on.  I couldn't stop breastfeeding, so I used a nipple shield every time I fed for 2 weeks.  That really helped lessen the pain and gave my nipples time to heal a bit.  One day, I fed without the shield and the pain wasn't as bad, so I used the shield off and on until I fed again without the shield and each time I repeated this cycle, my nipple hurt less and less, which meant I was finally able to feed every time without the shield.  I was so happy to be rid of it.  The shield is a pain to handle but it really helped to lessen the sharp pain before my nipples got used to be sucked on.<br>  <br>  Also, just like you, my nipple wasn't as sore either when I pump.  The suction of the pump isn't as forceful as the suction of my son latching on.|`|MeYILJeSaa	It sounds like she is latching on incorrectly. It shouldn't hurt at all.<br>  Tickle her top lip with your nipple until she opens WIDE, make sure her top lip isn't turned under when she's sucking. That can make it hurt more too. <br>  You may need to see a lactation consultant. <br>  If you're sure she's latching on correctly, you may want to call your doctor and see if you have an infection..<br>  <br>  Put some milk on your nipples, it really helps with the pain. Or get some lanolin cream.|`|PymLdXM8aa	YOu need to go to to the doctor. It sounds like you have an infection. Are the cracked and bleeding, or pussing? Your baby is most likely not getting a proper latch, and that is why they are so sore and hurts more when shes nursing. At 7 weeks you should be fine to just pump for a few days to let your nipples heal. Otherwise you can go to a LC and they have things for this. I believe there called nipples shields?<br>  <br>  GL and good for you to keep going. I also had very cracked and sore nipples the first couple weeks, and it was rough but you just have to let them heal and always make sure shes latched on well... OH and also i forgot to ALWAYS use Lanolin or something like it when your sore.... honestly the stuffs amazing.... i didnt really use it after, but if this keeps happening you probably should.  GL hunny :)|`|u3YMCNLKaa	It sounds like she's not latching on properly. Make sure her mouth is wide open before you give her the breast. Her entire mouth should cover the areola, not just the nipple. I had the same problem with my first baby! It was so painful! With my second, I had no pain. Good luck!|`|9EmOuiovaa	you may have a blocked ducked try rubbing the area while having a warm shower and keep feeding as if you stop it will only get worse. if the skin around the area looks red and is warm to touch go to your doctor.
7VJcd5YLaa	After 6 months old - they can have children's motrin.  If you still are really worried, you can take her in - they work for you - not the other way around - the ER will be happy to answer your questions - I don't like to take my kids in unless I am absolutely sure they need to be seen - they get exposed to a lot more than if I keep them at home and watch and wait -  don't do too much ice cold though - you can cause her to get chilled and actually raise her temperature if she begins to shiver.  <br>  <br>  Dress her lightly - put her on a sheet, give some tylenol or motrin (you can call ER for dosage if you don't have a dosage chart for her weight), relax - 103 is not as high as it seems - they can go up still higher and be ok.  <br>  <br>  Give fluids - if she is vomiting - go easy - keeping hydrated is key here whether vomiting or not.<br>  <br>  And take a deep breath - if this is the first high fever you've had with her - sorry to say it won't be the last.  <br>  <br>  She'll be fine.  <br>  <br>  If she does become lethargic (hard to rouse or really out of it) take her in immediately.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way - if you take her in - you might get some peace of mind.  She's your baby and you have to follow your gut.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Give her some baby tylenol, this helps greatly with high fevers. 103 if awfully high though, as 104 can cause brain damage I believe. If nothing is working I would bring her in. Or try giving her some ice water in a bottle (if she still takes one). Or a cup even. Good luck and I hope your daughter feels better soon!|`|qUOaE4uLaa	Dear I dont care what the ppl at the ER said....take that baby to the hospital. She can start having seizures. 103 is too high for a baby that age.....get a towel and put it under cold water then wrap her in it. Make sure you are giving her ice and not water to drink. Just let her suck on the cubes until you get to the ER.<br>  <br>  Ask your baby's doctor when she'd like you to call if your baby has a fever. Common guidelines are:<br>  <br>  ?  If your baby is less than 3 months old and has a temperature of 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher, call the doctor immediately. A baby this young needs to be checked for serious infection or disease.<br>  <br>  ?  For a baby between 3 and 6 months old, call if his temperature reaches 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) or higher.<br>  <br>  ?  If your baby is 6 months or older, call if his fever reaches 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) or higher.<br>  <br>  When you call, the doctor will probably ask you about other symptoms. The most important thing is how your baby looks and acts — if he has lost his appetite, has little energy, is noticeably pale or flushed, or is extremely irritable and can't be consoled, or if you notice other changes in his behavior and appearance|`|u3YMCNLKaa	First of all, don't freak out! If you have called the ER and they say to wait it out, then they know what they are talking about. A baby this age can certainly have a fever that high, but you definately want to take measures to keep it down. Keep her in just a diaper and t shirt to let the heat escape from her body, alternate beween baby Tylonal and Motrin to fill in the gaps between the doses. (That's what my children's pediatrician has me do.) Just look out for any sudden changes in your baby that do not seem right, and keep giving her liquids to prevent dehydration. Just don't give her too much water, breasmilk or formula is best, water in moderation. Good luck!|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Please, Please, please, Listen. <br>  It is normal for children to get high temperatures with a virus. 103 is a normal high temperature. children do NOT get brain damage with a temperature of 104. Actually for brain damage to occur the bodies temperature for a child must reach over 107 degrees. The body usually never reaches this temperature unless under 2 conditions, 1) the child is left in a hot place like a car or 2) there is a problem with the child's hypothalamus - the temperature regulation center in the body. <br>  I have seen many children have temperatures 105 and they turn out just fine. <br>  give tylenol or motrin and lots of fluids.|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	please try the ice cube thing it really does work.
5wmrZEQ9aa	I had a preemie too.  We also had to supplement with formula, but only for a few weeks.  I was told to feed her more often, instead of supplementing.  I was told to feed her every 2 hours, regardless of whether she was acting hungry.  I did this, and her birth weight doubled by 3 months.  I fed her every 2 hours during the day, and every 4 hours at night until 3 months, when she started sleeping through the night.<br>  I would suggest stopping the formula, and try nursing her more often.  Don't let her "snack" every hour, but keep her to a 2-3 hour schedule instead of a 3-4 hour schedule.  You can still build up your milk supply by drinking lots of water, and eating oatmeal, and taking herbal supplements, such as Mother's Milk tea.  The more often you nurse, the more milk your body will produce.  I always pumped first thing in the morning also, before I fed my baby (about an hour or two before...I just got up really early.  It was a sacrifice, but I was also determined to nurse), and then took a hot shower, which helps stimulate the milk, and then fed my baby.  That helped my supply more than anything.<br>  Good luck!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I'm a preemie mom too.  You need to lay off the formula if you really want her to be breastfed.  You may need to nurse her more often for a while as your supply adjusts to her true need.  Breastfeeding is all supply and demand.  You have a supply that meets her needs now based on what she wants with the formula.  It only takes a couple of days of her nursing on demand to get your supply up to what she needs.  I'm not sure why you think your supply is down. Is it because your breasts don't feel as full?  That's normal at this stage.  I would caution pumping after every feed and here's why-your baby needs to adjust your supply.  If you pump after every feed that signals the body to make more but it's not necessarily what she wants/needs your body to make.  Let her nurse on demand to stimulate your supply and adjust to her needs.<br>  <br>  She will tell you what she needs.  Lose the formula and be prepared to nurse more often until she gets your supply to the level she wants.  Also, you are accustomed to feeding her every 3-4 hours.  Strictly breastfed babies can eat every 1 1/2-3 hours so don't be alarmed if she wants to eat more often than you are used to.  Just monitor that she's having wet diapers (which I'm sure she will!) The hospital gets us preemie moms so freaked out that it's hard to get past all the worry.  You are doing a great job and just be confident in your ability to provide for her.  She'll tell you what she needs.|`|XRX6vKNmaa	Stop your heath or vitamin store and ask for Fenugreek breastfeeding herb. It is safe and it won't harm the baby. It cost about 14 dollars. You can google the information if you have any questions and feel free to ask your doctor if you have any other concerns. <br>  <br>  I am glad you are breastfeeding it is great for the baby. Keep it up!|`|0c6afe76e38ea505da9f14e4c238a25caa	try a tea called mothers milk. you can buy it at any health food store and nurse nurse nurse!!!!!|`|p5oIcPsVaa	Don't lose hope and don't give up! It sounds like you're trying really hard. I had the exact same problem recently only for different reasons. All you can really do is nurse as often as possible.. and pump after each nursing session to get any remaining milk out and further stimulate the supply. So you might need to start pumping more than twice a day if you can. I also started taking the herbal supplement fenugreek and it really worked!! You do need to take a lot (about 3 capsules 3 times per day), but it helps for most women. I also eat 2 bowls of maple & brown sugar oatmeal per day. I was supplementing my baby with formula and she ended up being fed about 50/50 (breast & bottle) and it was a struggle to maintain my supply. Just try to stay relaxed if possible because stress doesn't help either. My milk supply has increased by far so those would be my suggestions to you. I hope this helped a little bit!!

PcjOgAacaa	The day 21 test ASSUMES you ovulate on day 14.  But, not all women will ovulate on day 14, even if you have a 28 day cycle.  They want to test you 7 days after you ovulate, so you need to figure out when you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Chart your BBT's, and when you notice a sustained thermal raise, you ovulated the day before the temperature rise.  See www.fertilityfriend.com or Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.  <br>  <br>  Or, you could use OPK's, and assume you ovulate the day after a positive result.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sk46uigvaa	DAY 21 I THINK

G diapers have a cover made of cloth, a snap in thing that holds the diaper cloth or insert. sometimes it takes a few to make them leak proof. with these you can use a flushable diaper insert , or a washable diaper cloth. with cloth diapers, you would have literally a cloth that is washable and reusable. they do have pins though and my niece has been poked and she lets you know it. also with the cloth diapers you'd need to get covers. the good thing about these are you can keep them and in a sense they are cheaper as far as buying diapers. however laundry is always being done. and to clean baby poo off of these is not the greatest and sometimes the poo actually runs out of the diapers and all over the baby and whoever is holding them.  learning how to fold them so they fit properly takes practice. trust me i have been through it. there are a few things i can think about with disposable diapers. for one they sit in the land fill for up to 300 years. you spend a whole bunch of money on them and also go through a lot and a real lot at that. Sometimes the baby will grow out of a diaper as soon as you buy a whole pack of them and it is a waste of money. if you don't care about how much you are spending then do the disposable but if the parents are trying to go "green" then diffidently the G diapers and the cloth diapers.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	<a href="http://www.gdiapers.com/gdiapers101/flush-compost-or-toss?gclid=CO6j1-7-7JgCFQw9GgoduWkQ1A" rel="nofollow">http://www.gdiapers.com/gdiapers101/flus...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diapers.com/Product/SearchResults.aspx?FreeText=green+diapers&QueryFrom=Search&cm_mmc=Google-_-Diapers%2FGeneric-_-Green+Diapers+%2F+Generic-_-organic+diapers-3010112741|-|100000000000000546721&cm_guid=1-_-100000000000000546721-_-3010112741&gclid=CKO4yvb-7JgCFQG7GgodnVc81A" rel="nofollow">http://www.diapers.com/Product/SearchRes...</a>|`|7y8OUFFYaa	Diapers you eat after your baby s h i t s in them.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Organic diapers are big grape leaves and twine! Yay!|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Most likely organic diapers are safer for babies than other diapers because they don't contain as many harsh chemicals and dyes. I'd go ahead and give them for a baby shower :]|`|xfj1B7YSaa	yeh its totally safe for babies. the only difference of organic diapers to regular ones are the thngs the factory used to make the diapers. theres really no difference wen it comes to like using it for a baby. the best part about organic diapers is helping the enviroment. so for the organic ones. im not sure if its cheaper or more expensive than the regular ones
jxpEIKI4aa	As a childcare provider and the eldest of 7 (so I was 2nd mom for many years) there are a couple of things you need to realize about kids and parents. First, kids will get hurt. Kids will get hurt. Kids will get hurt. And if you lock them in a padded cell they will find a way to get hurt. And guess what? 90% if the time it's not anybody's fault. Don't blame yourself or your sisters. They've merely accepted this fact. That's not to say kids should be allowed to swing from the ceiling, but that brings me to my second point: <br>  When the parents are there, let them be the parent. When your sisters say they are "there", allow the responsibility of the children's safety to fall from your hands and go to theirs. If anything does happen allow the mothers to be accountable for it. It takes the pressure off you and also shows you respect their parental authority. <br>  Realize that constantly "giving advice" on how your sisters should raise their kids might seem like you think they're "bad mothers" in their eyes. Trust me; they know they're not perfect parents better than you do. And they know their kids are not always angels (whether they can admit it out loud or not). Although you mean well, they may feel like you're criticizing them, and if they're on the defensive when they're around you, any help you try to provide will fall on deaf ears. <br>  <br>  So, first learn to respect your sisters as mothers. Make a list of everything they do that makes them good parents. Maybe one spends a half hour playing with her kids, or tucks them in each night, or makes sure they get at least one serving of fruits and veggies a day or they always have clean clothes. No matter how big or small write it down. Read these lists before you visit your sisters. Then try to give each one compliment on their parenting during your time with them. When you see a niece/nephew doing something you don't agree with take a moment to count to three slowly. Access the situation. Why does it bother you? Is it because it's too chaotic for you? Is there something you don't want to be broken? Do they make you jumpy? Is it more about you than them? If so, excuse yourself and go to another room to gather your wits. Remember, mom is used to this, so it won't bother her like it might you. Breathe. Relax. Go back with a smile. On the other hand, if they really are putting themselves in danger, then you can step in. Take a deep breath, walk over to the child, get on their level (make eye contact as best as you can), and gently ask them to "stop jumping off the kitchen counter". Then give the reason that you want them quit. "Because you might bump your head on the cabinet or the floor." Then give them something else to do. "I brought some Lego blocks. Would you like to play with those?" <br>  This kills two birds with one stone. First, I've found that children respond best when you treat them with respect and intelligence. Just yelling "get down!" often falls on deaf ears because it doesn't mean anything to them. What they're doing is fun and you just want to spoil it. But if you take the time to explain why you want them to stop, they might not want to stop having fun, but they also don't want to be hurt. If you can respect their intelligence they'll be more likely to respect your authority in return. But if jumping off the counters is the most fun to them, then not getting hurt may not be enough to make them stop. That's why having something else for them to do will help. By re-directing them to another activity they'll see they can have fun and be safe too. If you'll join them in the fun, they'll be more excited to do it because you're not just bossing them around, you want to be with them. And kids (like adults) love to be wanted.<br>  You'll also show respect to your sisters because you're not ordering them around or criticizing them. You show that you genuinely care about the kids, and aren't merely on a rampage against their parenting. <br>  Try not to say anything negative about their parenting for awhile. Tell them what they're doing right (especially after they do it). When sis gives little Joey apple slices you could say, "I think making sure that the kids have fruit everyday is wonderful. It's so important for kids to be healthy. You do a great job making sure they eat right." Never mind that they go to McDonald's everyday, too. Stick with the good stuff. When Joey says thank you, tell mom, "Joey has good manners. You've taught him well." What you're doing is building up your sisters. You become a positive force in their lives. You're showing them that you love them, respect them, and notice how hard they work. In turn, they will respect you. It will take some time. Especially if their more accustomed to criticism than praise. Once they respect you, they'll also respect your opinions. <br>  If the kids refuse to listen to you, you can go to their mom. Think of a respectful way that you’d like to be approached if it was your child. Try something like, "I've noticed that Joey|`|6zeZwQL6aa	Unfortunately, I don't think you can force your sisters to listen to you.  They don't think there's anything wrong with their children's behavior, so they're not going to listen to anyone.  It's really unfortunate your sisters would rather sit there and relax than take the responsibility of watching out for their own children.  It will probably take a serious injury for them to wake up, but even if that happens, they still may not get the hint.  Sorry...|`|EMKuBql8aa	You can't. You need to MYOB even if you have kids. No parents are perfect. Thats nice you worked somewhere, but you work for a few hours, clock out, and come home...being a parent is a 24/7 job. Until you are one, don't input your thoughts/views.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Like all people, there is little that one can do to be heard, if someone chooses to be deaf. If you really feel the kids are in danger then SPEAK UP! Be clear with the kids when you give commands, for example, "be careful" is rather vague. State the specific behavior you would like to see or would like to see stop. However you need to realize that because these kids are not getting the message at home, it will be foreign to them. I think if they are exhibiting these behaviors in your home you have every right to say something. However if this is at their home, or a third party then it is really up to your sisters.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	One of my sisters has 6 kids and doesn't pay attention to any of the stuff they do. They get hurt all the time, but there really isn't anything I can say or do about it. You can't make someone listen and it's really intrusive and frankly rude to tell someone they are being a bad parent. Basically mind your own business and learn from whatever you think their mistakes are. Your turn will come around when you have kids.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	even though they are family u really cant say anything even if u have kids of your own. their your sisters' kids you have to let them learn from their mistakes|`|MzHwklzKaa	Quit!<br>  <br>  You aren't going to get any respect, and eventually, your sisters and the kids will resent you.  <br>  <br>  Step back.<br>  <br>  Remember, if they have you, a built in baby sitter, why should they lift a finger?<br>  <br>  All you can do is have rules for when they visit you, or when you take them places.  After that, mind your own business.<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD:<br>  People are telling you to call CPS.<br>  BEWARE!!!<br>  Calling the government into your family business can have serious consequences.  Plus, no matter what they say it's NEVER anonymous!!  It will get back to your sisters who called the law.|`|sLkruqYVaa	hunny kids do crazy stuff what you re sisters probably know that you don t yet is that no matter how much you watch them no matter how much time you spend running after them crying out "no don't do that'  stuff still happens their isn t much you can do about that , and the other guy is right it isn t the same thing looking after some ones kids that you "give back" at the end of the day as being a 24 7 parent. Im not saying that it's the right attitude to just sit down and drink your coffee while the kids are swinging off the chandelier and climbing on the roof but your sisters must live their children and if they feel that they are truly in danger they will interfere
DJMPQlFDaa	So she put one of her children up for adoption, while she was living out on the street. Did she inform the child's father? They might have took in their child. Well in any event is she still living in the streets or does she have a stable environment. Because if she now has a stable environment she might be able to adopt. Why does she want to adopt? Is it to replace the child she put up for adoption? I would make sure that the adoption agency knows that she doesn't take care of the babies she has now and for you I would hope you have custody of your son and wouldn't let him live out in the street because that is cold blooded.|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	i dont quiet understand this..<br>  people adopt children because it gets hard finacially.. they will normally do the youngest or oldest as they think they will cope easier.. <br>  i would personally move the youngest as they wouldnt have good memories of me..<br>  if she was pregnant and adopted the baby maybe its because its against her religion.. or doesnt want an abortion so that was the safest way..|`|CrKox2niaa	Maybe there's information she didn't give to the agency? You can contact the agency she's trying to adopt through and give them all the facts you have so that another child isn't inadvertently put into a bad situation.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I don't know.  It shouldn't be allowed.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Why don't you just ask her.|`|2N4j1ficaa	you can contest any child she want to adopt as  you have relevant information and im shore if the agency's have the right info the children would not be placed with her in the first place
PxawVQ7Xaa	Let them put him in jail for a short while that should do the trick, that's what happens when you do those types of things when you're older. <br>  <br>  I think it's interesting how you complain about him breaking the law then do something even more illegal, stealing, you're not the parent so you can't use the "my house, my money" excuse.<br>  <br>  You can't beat respect into some one, if I completely kicked the cr@p out of you that means you would respect me?|`|prqrQcd1aa	Teach your brother leading by example. Sounds like you are also having to be the parent as well as the brother.. see what has got him so pissed off about, talk to him about it, and continue to discipline him and be consistent with it in all aspects!|`|EMKuBql8aa	Have you guys' thought of military school? That might fix it, lol.<br>  <br>  Easy fix: Ground the crud out of him, I'm talking bare minimum (no electronics, nada except school books) Let his comments roll off of you, he is 16 and when he sees they get to you, it just encourages it more. If you ignore it, he will eventually stop. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is extreme, but do what my parents did: Take literally EVERYTHING out of his room except for the bed, his clothes, and school supplies. He gets 3 things back a time for good behavior or maybe a good grade on a test or something, I dunno. I slept on a mattress on a floor for 5 months, but it sure straightened me out, lol.<br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN: Are you considered your brothers sole caregiver? If you are, military school might not be out of reach financially. I forgot the percentage, but I believe at 30% or more you can send your minor dependents there free of cost. Actually, I'm pretty sure it is 30%, I'm rated at 40% and ithink it is free for my kids if I ever wanted to send them there, lol. I know he isn't "technically" a dependent, but there is probably some loophole for someone in your situation where you take care of him day in day out. Call your rep and find out more.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Your parents obviously did something right to raise a good, respectful young man like you. If you had received those grades, and used that type of disrespect to your father, what would he have done? Think about it and then do it.

If it comes down to it, overpower him, and let him know that he will not win against you. pin him down and dont let him go until he relaxes, and then tell him that you just want what good for him. he will get emotional and understand, and (believe me), his behavior will get better. im not sure what your injury is, but please be careful if it comes to this point.|`|JPfraSk9aa	If you can get some video's of real things that happened not fiction and let this sink in with a little respect to the guys that gave him the freedom to act like any kind of jerk he wants.<br>  while families are left homeless or vets have returned to improper care never to have their own lives again so he can have his.  Take him to a church and keep him in their.  Take him to a vet support group just to show him what they all did and especially you because you love him.  Or you just might have to knock his brains out.  Be nice to go to a juvenile delinquent camp.  Your problem no one ever sees him doing this stuff and he lies to defend IT.  Buy a camera phone but don,t let him know.  The things we do for love.Your mom and dad need to wake up and he needs to move out and possibly ruin his life in a prison. Go to a website and view that and maybe this one will get to him.  www.certainvictory.com<br>  Who knows maybe someday he'll be an honorable officer.<br>  God Bless you and keep you well,<br>  God Bless him and keep him safe.

MzHwklzKaa	It's never a good thing to hold it, no matter what age you are.<br>  <br>  When potty training, it's best to get to the potty ASAP.  No waiting.  They're still learning about how "full" is "too full", it's best to get them in to go so that they succeed, rather than having to clean up a near miss.<br>  <br>  The ability to hold it will develop on it's own as the child gets more control and maturity.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|hieQHR0daa	Once the bladder is full there is still urine coming down from the kidneys to the bladder and the tubes that carry this get stuck and pressured by this fullness. This can result in infection or over stretching of the ureters. Therefor quick emptying is more helpful. Urine is constantly being made and running down the ureters into the bladder where it is contained until the bladder is full.<br>  The bladder grows with the child and capacity increases. No one should put of emptying the bladder.<br>  I hope this was helpful
5YPSyP91aa	they can sleep easy after something like that because they cry hard and it makes them sleepy. see if u can wake her though, i know it will be hard to do because they sleep deep when they first go to sleep. in the future, don't let her sleep after a head hit, give them time to show you they are ok, you want to see alertness and giggling etc before you give the all clear. there will be more head hits, many more, and hard ones. our son has had some hard ones and it's very unsettling every time, but he always seems to be ok after.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	An elbow is not that hard.

(i am a person that suffers from self inflicted noise induced hearing problems (loud guitar), not fun)|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Does your baby have a vibrating chair?

But you'll notice that loud noises usually soothe better than soft ones...vacuums, washing machines, shushing loudly.  Babies are used to the noise in the womb.<br>  Good thing you've got a bass player...|`|AA11283813	Hey, this is awesome!!!  The low tones of the bass are probably really very soothing  and comforting.  Did he play allot around you when you were pregnant?<br>     I wouldn't be surprised at all of this cute little tiny kid played bass when he/she can reach the strings...better.  ~wink~   enjoy!!|`|l6nAcep5aa	great idea i may try something similar! as i also have a three week old son.. he has colic and does alot of crying as well!<br>  im sure it wont hurt bub at all :)|`|NOjcTeT4aa	No it won't it's really great you already found something that works with him.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	I think it's great! Maybe it will make him smarter also!|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Nah, shouldn't be a problem. You have a clever daddy on your hands :)|`|jYPeis3Saa	no. its clearly soothing to him

2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	If you can, try to stay away from all medication while you're pregnant.  Even the OTC and herbal remedies can be damaging.  In fact, most any OTC pain medicine is harmful.<br>  <br>  Read labels carefully.  Some medicines will strictly say to avoid the medication, and others that have some possible side effects will say to call your doctor before taking.<br>  <br>  If you're on prescriptions, your OB should have told you at your first visit.  If you haven't seen one yet, you should.  There are some online sites drugs.com and webmd.com that are pretty helpful.  <br>  <br>  In my sources, I put an article on ehow that I found really helpful when I was pregnant.  Hope it helps you too.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	you shouldnt take any medication while pregnant. if you are going to take anything at all, contact your doctor or midwife first.|`|XKhNw221aa	NEVER take anything with aspirin. no matter what. also, think of your baby like a tea cup poodle, anything you wouldn't give that poodle, don't put in your body. but avoid most medications except those prescribed while you knew you where prego. but it is ok to take prenatal vitamins.|`|f77aab9e43f19a60f6283af7e67b7d48aa	Okay, so far, everyone is right, BUT I think that you were more thinking along the lines of "Is there anything Specific that you shouldn't be taking while pregnant".  There are whole lists of things you shouldn't take, but mostly it's all stating the 1% of ALL THE WOMEN ON THE PLANET would have a reaction to This drug or that antihistamine...<br>  <br>  You should talk to you doctor before taking anything exotic, but mostly it's the antibiotics and things of that nature that you need to watch out for.<br>  <br>  Pain Killer wise you can't take anything with Asprin in it b/c it thins your blood and could cause you to hemorrhage.  But you can take low doses of Tylenol and Advil.  No Aleve (naproxin Sodium), same problem with that as Asprin, but for different reasons.  NOTHING With Codeine in it, no muscle Relaxers or anxiety meds w/o Doctors Orders.  <br>  <br>  Don't know if this helps, but good luck.  My wife is 31 weeks preg. right now, and I had to have this same argument / discussion with her.  You don't have to worry, just be careful.  :)|`|cIn8BkYHaa	You should stay away from advil and asprin for sure. Depending on what perscription drugs you could be in for disorders they may suggest switching to a more baby friendly one. If you need to take pain medication take tylenol.|`|nyuB4POqaa	You should avoid all medications, unless your doctor has otherwise stated|`|l9EENhecaa	<a href="http://getinanswerss.solarsciences.info" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswerss.solarsciences.info</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	It is hard to say.  Periods after a pregnancy take awhile to get back regular.  My little girl is almost a year old now and I can still miss a period one month.  :/  Some may last for a few days and then the next I can go for 3 weeks.  :(  <br>  <br>  You might want to talk to your doctor about getting on some sort of birth control to help you get them back regulated.|`|oWdNHaRGaa	Hi<br>  i had my little girl 2 yrs ago and i didn't get my period for a least 4 monts after i had mu baby. my doctor said that it was my hormons.
PLbmKNpvaa	I'd just wear some nice black pants or jeans and a comfortable top. Keep in mind that really they're probably going to be more interested in what kind of person you are (if they're any kind of decent humans themselves) than what you're wearing.<br>  But if it makes you feel better, wear a red top if you have one as it's a strong color and will make you feel more 'powerful'. It will also show that you're not one to hide in a corner and that you're a strong person. Colors can show how we feel and if you want to feel confident you need to look confident :)<br>  Good luck :)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I think you'll be fine. The fact that you're even asking the question shows that you are considerate.<br>  <br>  I was wearing jeans and a comfy top and had just come off a 10 hour flight when I met the in-laws!<br>  <br>  If they know you're pregnant just wear something comfortable. You don't want to be sitting there talking to them, thinking about how uncomfortable you are.|`|xsvDrtrRaa	why just now? you should meet them at first wear something that looks formal and makes you look good but not to much that will show your smart|`|2N4j1ficaa	any thing you want they will love you hun ... don't be so worried  he loves you so will they|`|p6AMoTs8aa	first off, do they know u r expecting? if they are wear something maternal well it depends how far along you are. Please dress decent no cleavage nor short skirts stilettos. You can wear a nice top with jeans or a nice dress|`|IHDVQs3kaa	You should wear whatever makes you feel comfortable.  Remember, they are probably just as nervous as you are.|`|TELl62yKaa	yr comfort is priority, so u can wear any thing what is comfortable to u and yes also sober.|`|FRE2gov3aa	Before you got pregnant you should have met his parents a long time ago.|`|C5ZocttQaa	wear something comfortable....a pair of basic jeans a cute shirt....be urself if he loves u then they should love u too|`|xp0BnsD0aa	This happened to me - finally met the in-laws 8.5 months preggo (because of the distance away).

QwHHmJohaa	If she's skinny she will show very quickly.  You also tend to swell a little in the beginning, just your body getting ready to start stretching, it may go down around the middle of her third month.|`|Cu8svhwAaa	Yeah, sounds pretty normal to me, especially if she's on her second.  Also, it depends on the body size before becoming pregnant. It should be about the time they do the ultrasound to "date" the pregnancy so maybe they will find out why she's so big already.|`|utYyjRFdaa	ooo what if she is having more then one baby? that could be a possibility...i don't know to much about the rate that the child should be growing...but 2 months sounds a bit early to be clearly "showing" i thought it was supposed to be around 3...but hey everyones body is diff...what is her body size...that could also be a factor<br>  <br>  n your dog is such a pretty color|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Don't stress!!! Tell your sister its normal! I didn't start showing til my 5 month!<br>  And i am a little small girl (125lbs) --Well then i was. I'm 36wks weigh about 155lbs now. But i don't look 8months prego!<br>  <br>  Every girl is different!

There is no normal in pregnancy.  Everyone is different.|`|dJ7xagFCaa	yes yes! its normal chill... maybe its twins, or the baby could be developing faster, nothing abnormal|`|V5W8jE5Yaa	yeah she is fine...but if you are that worried ask a doctor

kc2Sa7ibaa	I don't know.. My friend started modelling as well and now she is 'too good' for me.<br>  <br>  I know I would have low self esteem without models anyways. All you have to do is look around the classroom to see 10 girls prettier than me :-\|`|XOnSRoR2aa	It all depends on the girl. Some will become aloof and arrogant with even just a pinch of success as a model, some will become incredibly self-aware and conscious of her flaws and hyper-vigilant about what she eats, and some will simply treat it as a job and not let it have a tremendous affect on her. <br>  <br>  I've been modeling since I was six years old, and I have a healthy self-esteem and am completely comfortable in my own skin most of the time, and no one would ever describe me as being "prissy." I rarely ever wear makeup or bother with my hair, and I'm more interested in surfing and skateboarding than shopping. For me, modeling is just an awesome way to get a paycheck. It doesn't define who I am, or affect the way I treat my friends, and I don't starve myself or fuss over my appearance. It hasn't thrashed my self esteem at all, but my esteem was never built around my looks to begin with. <br>  <br>  I'm really sorry you lost your friend. I imagine the novelty of modeling will eventually wear off and she will really miss you and regret losing your friendship. : )<br>  <br>  ~ Pax / peace|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I don't think so, I think to be a model you need to have a tough skin and an amazing self esteem or it will. I use to model, but I don't any more. I did a bit of everything; runway, print work, and commercials. I was signed to an agency and I was really in to it, but then one day I got bored of it and feed up with the whole model thing. My agent wanted me to drop down to 110 from 125, I'm 5'11 so that's way too skinny. I didn't want to do it anymore. Sure sometimes my self esteem would be down, but for the most part I was more than fine. But I think if I would have stayed in the industry longer, it would have started to take a tole on my self esteem.|`|AIJgbvIcaa	I don't agree with that.<br>  <br>  I think everyone has a choice to be comfortable in their own skin. :)<br>  We're all self conscious on a certain level but looking at someone with envy is a choice.<br>  Plus half the models out there are ugly and odd looking.|`|OFdCY2Owaa	No, I don't think so. These girls who model choose to get into it and train themselves to stay thin, but have fun doing it.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	no i don't think so. so many people blame the media for eating disorders with young girls. the girls choose to listen to that garbage about getting under 100 pounds. it is their own choice. and yes i do know a lot of eating disorders have to do with depression and not getting skinny. but some have to do with both. that also goes for beauty pageants. some pageant moms are absolutely crazy but if the girl enjoys it then let her do it!|`|5tqh0akYaa	It depends who you model for. You could be doing it for fun or you could get put with people that starve themselves. Not all modeling is bad just some companies.
tnhF5Gaiaa	Aww that sounds like so much fun. I think she will love it! I love Waikiki beach, I don't live in Hawaii but I go there a lot. It sounds like a great 18th birthday to me, she would have to be a crazy girl to not love it.|`|evEJxv06aa	yes it does sound fun and i know your sister will be very surprised and  have a blast party and also go eat in a restaurant that will be fun to right here is one site that will help you find the perfect one its called yelp.com|`|8DhRxcF7aa	This sounds like a lot of fun. I wish my parents would have down something like this for my 18th birthday|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	strippers|`|uYDoPNv9aa	wow! AWESOME sounds fun:)<br>  good luck girly|`|YAM1LFsgaa	sounds like she would love it!<br>  <br>  I would!
I2lEkHJ9aa	NO, NO, NO! no burning of the nipple please!!! what you are experiencing sounds normal. as your breast are changing as you are nursing sometimes the nipple itself will get these and they can even bleed. just keep nursing. it wont hurt the baby and will go away on its own. just make sure the baby is latching on correctly. this will happen sometimes because the baby is latching on to the nipple itself. the baby needs to get past the nipple and push down on the area around the nipple. this will help prevent further damage. express breast milk and put on your nipples. this will help heal the damage tissue. you can use lanolin ointment as well. you might want to contact a lactation specialist. they are the best at answering breastfeeding questions instead of your OB/GYN.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Get a new gyno.....|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I don't know what it is but please for your own sake get another gynecologist.|`|Dx2ayijwaa	Wow, maybe you should switch to a different Gyno? You really do need to go to a GP, and as soon as possible. I understand your feeling inadequate about the body you inherited from pregnancy, I felt that way too. I just decided one day that though my body may be torn up, my mind wasn't and I really didn't care..... Stuff happens, life sucks sometimes. Anyway, The cyst could be a couple things. I'm most worried that it could be breast cancer. You really need to get it checked out like all sorts of yesterday,  and if your not satisfied with there response, don't hesitate for a referal to get a second opinion.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	Sorry, that stinks... but maybe you should find a new gyno?|`|2N4j1ficaa	wow not heard of this before  but cyst do take a very long time to go and some do require surgery|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Sounds like a bleb, or milk blister:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nipplebleb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  What is a milk blister? <br>  <br>  A milk blister, or blocked nipple pore, is also called a bleb or nipple blister, or simply "milk under the skin." It occurs when a tiny bit of skin overgrows a milk duct opening and milk backs up behind it. A milk blister usually shows up as a painful white, clear or yellow dot on the nipple or areola (see photo), and the pain tends to be focused at that spot and just behind it. If you compress the breast so that milk is forced down the ducts, the blister will typically bulge outward. Milk blisters can be persistent and very painful during feeding, and may remain for several days or weeks and then spontaneously heal when the skin peels away from the affected area. <br>  <br>  This is not the same as a blister on the nipple caused by friction. This type of blister, which may sometimes be a red or brown "blood blister," can be caused by friction from baby's improper latch or sucking or from the use of a badly fitting nipple shield or pump. In this type of blister, the problem is nipple damage due to friction, rather than a milk duct opening being blocked. Here is information on healing broken skin in the nipple area, plus more thoughts on the causes of friction or blood blisters.<br>  <br>  A white spot on the nipple may also be caused by an obstruction within the milk duct (as opposed to skin covering the milk duct). The obstruction might be a tiny, dry clump of hardened milk or a "string" of fattier, semi-solidified milk. The first type of milk duct obstruction will often pop out from the pressure of nursing or manual expression, or can be gently scraped from the surface of the milk duct with a fingernail. The second type can often be manually expressed from the milk duct; reducing saturated fats can help to prevent recurrence of this type of obstruction. Both of these types of milk duct obstruction are associated with recurrent mastitis.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You have to click on the link to get to the photo. I would try to get a new gyno since she's not being very helpful and all. I can't imagine paying someone for services that they really aren't providing.|`|aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	There is a very simple burning procedure to be done in order to remove it - ask your GP not the gyno.
2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Well, that depends on what you mean by right after.  I lost 12 pounds right after.  (Literally, hours after I was weighed).<br>  <br>  After that, I still lost weight very quickly.  I had gotten up to 148 and within a month, I was close to pre-baby weight of 120 and I wasn't even exercising it off or dieting.  Or breast feeding which is supposed to help.  I was one of the "lucky ones"<br>  <br>  If you're worried about the rate of how fast your losing weight, you might want to talk to your doctor.  Everyone is different, true.  But losing it too fast could be a sign that there is something wrong and it is being caused by something unhealthy.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I think the total is 10 pounds... But i'm guessing it varies a bit-I carried a lot of water with my middle son so dropped more weight than with my older and youngest ones.|`|OUbgs89taa	you will lose the weight of baby, placenta and amniotic fluid. If you breast feed you will get rid of stored up water and fat faster than if you bottle feed (so i've heard)<br>  <br>  Your womb will shrink back to normal within a couple of weeks so that might make a change in weight aswell.|`|nyuB4POqaa	everyone is very different<br>  I lost 10 lbs right after, BUT that's all I lost LOL <br>  I haven't lost anything since and it's been almost 4 months <br>  :(
Xrwvu5Uraa	You are doing the best you can! Don't drink fruit juices, stick to water mostly...and try to eat some raw veggies and fruits. Also, eat oatmeal, eggs and bacon for breakfast, no carb food, like breads and some cereals. That is what my doctor told me to do because I have gained 25 pounds, putting me at 150 at 6 months pregnant and I was obviously 125 pre-pregnancy. I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to lose all the weight after! <br>  <br>  Good luck!
OTBv9AsBaa	Since the economy is so bad right now, you really shouldn't have even allowed yourself to get pregnant. I'm sorry to say that but it's true. Anyway, you should talk to your sdoctor about proper weight gain during pregnancy. Good luck with the weight gain and good luck with struggling to pay to take care of the unborn little one!|`|nyuB4POqaa	around the 8th month you usually gain a pound a week, and then the 9th month you slowly start to lose, you don't gain as much in the last month. Well for myself anyway.|`|ILX3pSNfaa	TACOS SMELL GOOD<br>  ~?Richard The Gay Clown?~|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	about the last 5-10 weeks of your pregnancy. although I am only 25 weeks my doctor just went over this with me because I already gained 25 pounds...=( <br>  <br>  good luck
LiJ5TQJraa	People are inconsiderate and the economy is crap, and I dont get that if people can afford to go out and eat why they cant afford to tip? Alot of folks don't realize that when you are getting a service like being waited on, getting nails done, hair, massage, the guy washing your car, taxi service, etc, you should tip....a lot of people know, but don't want to waste extra money...<br>  <br>  I'm 7 months pregnant, and I work as a Massage Therapist and its starting to feel like labor-style work by now, and today, I had 4 clients, and not one tipped me. And it kills me when they pay, and then ask me for $5.00 or $10.00 in change when I just massaged them for 60 min.....|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i was a waitress the whole time i was pregnant, i actually worked the day i had my baby! i made good money, i used the "pity" to my full advantage..<br>  <br>  actually, one time this guy said "hey.. ill give you this tip if you name your baby after me" as he hands me 2 bucks.. i said , "what do you want me to name her?? 'cheap a s s ???" luckily he thought it was funny and left me 10 bucks.<br>  <br>  but i did have someone say "you know usually, when your pregnant, you grow out, but your just so wide..." i was like WTF?!?<br>  <br>  people are just terribly serious when it comes to food. dont take it personally.|`|VStc5INEaa	they probly liked you they jus probly didnt kno the "20% rule". u would be suprised to kno how many ppl dont kno about it.....im 19 and my mom explained it to me last week. i dont think it was anything personal....or that could have been all they could spare at the time. u kno gas is goin back up.....|`|nyuB4POqaa	No, I doubt it's because they didn't like you<br>  Sounds like they were pretty darn cheap|`|AA11471943	im really surprised they were not tipping you better! everybody loves someone pregnant!!|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	we are in a recession atm, no one has spare any thing to give, dont take it personally
BV0Hn4jDaa	I personally don't like the name Danger..I've never heard of it before. If you want your kid to have like a fierce name or something, I suggest Hunter..Rylan Hunter<br>  Is Rylan Ryan and Dylan combined?It's a really unique name and, well , yeah.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	no its not ok|`|MKyOKdPwaa	i think Rylan is a great name but i really agree with your friends i dont think your son would appreciate the middle name danger...you have to thik of when he is older and going through school or even job interviews and when travelling with a passport|`|cIn8BkYHaa	Hmm. I was hoping you were going to say his first name is Rodney middle name Danger last name Field. Just kidding. It's really personal preference as to what you like. A fair amount of people get stuck with middle names they aren't too fond of all the time.|`|fNv2Re6baa	I do think it is cruel. Especially if you remember the phrase ".....Danger is my middle name..." However, you could have a name such as Kanger or Pager. If you like the ring of it, why not have a middle name that rhymes with Danger?|`|88ItgDEoaa	Of course NOT OKAY. You should not keep such a name to which people will laugh. Moreover, the child, when he grows up will condemn. He might really turn a danger being provoked by his middle name.<br>  <br>  Keep a good name.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	I don't think it's a good idea. This baby will be a sweet and innocent child and shouldnt have "danger" in his name. no matter how cool you think it would be.

Doom?|`|DIuE4vshaa	My husband made sure our boy had the middle name Talon.  9 times out of 10 know one will know the middle name untill the day he walks on stage to get his diploma from high school.<br>  <br>   That's when everyone found out mine....I don't have one.|`|y8hLTig1aa	love it!!|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I think thats a very good name! Rylan is one of my favourites! I don't think it would be cruel to have Danger as a middle name, most boys don't even tell people their middle names.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|AA11391968	How about Rylan Espen (for ESPN sports channel).  Danger will lead him to trouble,|`|52otNiElaa	He's going to become a Punker.|`|xue72D76aa	If you have any guy friends, ask them how they would have felt about having the middle name "Danger".  You have to remember that kids are cruel and any fodder that they can get their hands on can be just the ticket to making your child miserable.  Names are incredibly important, as they are with you for life (unless you finally get that name change, lol!).  How would you have liked growing up with a similar middle name?|`|pOekC2Sqaa	Well, if you were saying is it okay to give him the name Danger as a first, then I would've said then that was cruel. However, because you're saying it's for the middle name, I don't mind too much. Though, it's a bit mean. Just think about what's going to happen when he's older. Whilst Rylan is nice, I don't think Danger is suitable for a middle name. Though, personally, I kind of like it. Even though you're friends are trying to help, it's up to you what you name your son in the end.<br>  <br>  G2B|`|8D5trv2Oaa	Hi, I don't think it's particularly cruel but it still isn't nice. He might get teased on at school. Maybe try combining Rylan with another name? Like Max, Rylan-Max.

nyuB4POqaa	My girl is 3 1/2 months, and I think she is teething as well. I really don't know much about teething either, because I'm a first time mom as well. But, I definetly know that something is going on, because she's been extra fussy for weeks, and constantly chews on things, Drools alot, refuses breast/bottle for at least 5-10 min's at alot of feedings, she isen't sleeping much at all, and her nose is slighty runny, she grabs at her ear quite a bit,( I had to her to the doctor, and no she doesn't have an ear infection) but she is not sick. Everyone says she is way too young to be teething, but I don't beleive that at all, because I had teeth when I was 4 months old, so obviously I had to be teething before hand to get 2 teeth at 4 months lol<br>  It sounds like he is teething|`|aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	There is not necessarily sign of teething. There are residuals on his gums that are etching or hurting the baby. He is trying to comfort himself ..the ones around should rush to clean his gums after each meal, not proudly sending a wrong message to everyone waiting for the first teeth to come out..and the poor baby is suffering. They've got around 6 more months to wait for that to happen.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	the babies will get very fussy. they will try and bite on anything and everything. you can usually tell when you stick your finger in your babies mouth and feel around the gums and it feels a little bitty hard spot sorta like a pebble on his gums. sometimes they run a fever. but every baby is different.|`|byM2zxPAaa	when he is drooling alot, pulling his ears and trying to eat his hands. also his urine may be very strong with a hint of ammonia, also a chance of nappy rash.<br>  also because hes trying to eat his bottle he might be ready for a weenie bit of baby rice, rafferty's have a very good organic rice made especialy for 4 month olds... you could try it..|`|TpvXqBPTaa	when your baby is drooling alot|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In my opinion, the only person who can really look in your baby's mouth, or feel and be sure that he is teething is the pediatrician.  In my experience, everybody else always thinks one's baby is teething early.  <br>  <br>  My son started drooling and sucking on his fist at around 4 months.  Grandparents, casual acquaintances and old ladies in the grocery store would inform me that he was definitely teething.  We didn't see a tooth until month 6.5.<br>  <br>  The real issue with teething is figuring out whether or not he is experiencing pain so that you can help him.  It's difficult to know at first.  But there were definitely times after he started teething but before teeth appeared that I was certain he was trying to tell me that his mouth hurt.  I mean, when he's jamming his fingers into his gum, crying and looking at you like "Please help me with this." it might be time for a little Tylenol or a teething ring.<br>  <br>  But in general, just hang on.  It's one of those "you'll know" things.|`|14JQ11AUaa	My son started to teeth just before he turned 4 months. He is 5 months and 1 week old now...no teeth yet. But his gum's hurt because his teeth are getting ready to grow. Your son may be teething, here are some ways of knowing:<br>  <br>  -Is he fussy?<br>  -Does he have a slight temp.?<br>  -Is he drooling a lot?<br>  -If you were to place your middle knuckle of your index finger side ways in his mouth, does his bite down real hard?<br>  -Does he chew/teeth on his fists/fingers?<br>  <br>  Things you can do for him during the teething period are:<br>  <br>  -Infants Motrin, if he is "real close" to 20lbs he will need 1.25ml, if he is smaller just ask the pharmacists.<br>  -Baby Oragel, they carry night time formula as well..Walmart has them as a package day/night for $4.<br>  -Teething toys<br>  -You can place your finger in ice water for a bit, until it is cold, then let him teeth on your finger.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you :)|`|RdprMxoUaa	All the things you mentioned are signs of teething. My son has had most of them. Blisters on the gums, red swollen gums, red cheeks, nappy rash, runny stools, chewing toys and fists a lot, not feeding as well as before, stuffy sinus, slight fever and generally unhappy. They can have them all together or one or two at a time.<br>  To those who say 3 months is early for teething, my son started at 2 months.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	with my son teethin consisted of lots of drooling and a runny nose. he chews on his fingers and gets a little fussier then normal.|`|L2Nde54Haa	yep, probably teething, most ppl expect a tooth 2 b visible or that u can feel it, but the truth is teething is also when the gums and bone are getting harder to prepare a solid foundation 4 those little nubs 2 grow, so baby might teeth 4 a while b4 u see any !! u'll have 2 deal with fussy, maybe fever, lotsa chewing and some little bit of rash, all worth it when u see those first teeth, makes them cute as heck!!    lol  , oh and all the dribbling u can handle!|`|OUbgs89taa	3 months is early for teething. Put your finger in babys mouth and run it along the gum area where teeth would be. If you feel a little sharp or hard bit. its probably a tooth coming in. Other signs are rosy red cheeks, grumpier than usual, more dribble, chewing on objects more. If your concerned just buy a teether from the store. Its nothing to stress about.<br>  <br>  My son was 5 months old when he got his first tooth. My neice was about 9 months so the timing varys.
575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	The points don't really mean much of anything, for the most part.  :)<br>  <br>  They add up when you sign on, when you answer, and when you get a correct answer.  Over time you move from one level to the next - and yet, when it comes down to it, they mean nothing more than that.  If you ask a question you lose a few points.  <br>  <br>  A couple of times Yahoo offered free little gifts (a little keychain thing, a plastic drinking cup - things like that) to people, and what they offered depended on the level someone was at.

7GJdKGyVaa	well, i have had many dogs in my 16 years of living. and mostly small dogs so i would like to think that i might have some experience with this subject... XD  <br>  <br>  a shih tzu is a great dog to have, they come in a few colors and they dont shed. and if the dog isnt allowed to be in the house when no one is home you could get a crate or cage for it so that way you can put it in there while your gone. <br>  <br>  i have a pure bred shih tzu and 2 shih tzu poodle mixes. they are great dogs and easy to train. and our biggest one is only 16 pounds. if you want suggestions or need info on different small breeds i would be happy to help. i have alot of experience with dogs so if any of my knowledge could help i would be happy to offer it.|`|2QvIM81Haa	Hm.. well if the dog isn't aloud in the house when you are out, I would suggest a big dog. Small dogs are.. well... kinda wimpy.|`|8oKazGVGaa	get a bulldog or a beethoven|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	A robot dog|`|SkKG0Kcqaa	what u should do is get a medium sized dog probably a hound- or dong thats bread for out doors and with little yard space ur going to need to walk it every day and play with it alot and i agree you should go with a shelter dog i have a shelter dog and hes the sweetest but make sure u can get one that handles out doors well with a lower energy|`|cj29AORfaa	Click the link below and take the little survey. After you submit it,a window will open telling you the best dogs for you along with some info on them. Hope this helps and goodluck.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	well i have always had pets so this has never really been an issue. but pets teach responsibility and you help them too. i think you need to tell her you will all take care of it. i strongly suggest you get a big dog since small dogs are uncomfortable outside. if there is an animal shelter in your area you should definitely adopt from the shelter. don't go wasting $1000+ on a little maltese or some other puppy mill bred dog. also there are a lot of mutts at shelters and mutts have less problems. my dog rocky is black lab, german shepherd, border collie and he has never had issues. but our pure bred yellow lab is already having hip problems at 3. labs are great but they require a lot of attention and they get horrible hip issues. however if you have a dog that is part lab there won't be many issues. if you are only getting one dog i also reccomend getting a pit bull. so many people dislike these dogs because they are notorious for being aggressive. they are more people dogs than "dog's" dogs. definitely go for a big dog though. Oh and yorkies are great but they need a lot of attention like most dogs and they could not stay outside for long alone. I hope you can get a dog and PLEASE save a dog's life and adopt from a shelter.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	well if the dog isnt allowed in the house then you will have to get a big dog. small dogs dont cope very well outside on their own.
G9UNW0NYaa	Wow!  It's not about you!!! If the mother has a shower, it is for baby stuff.  Seriously, if you think you need a macho man bag or something, go out and buy one yourself.  Ug.....|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I read something on here a while ago about having a poker game where the buy in is a packet of nappies/diapers. I thought that was a great idea.<br>  <br>  As for 'man gear', what do you mean by that? Baby stuff is for babies, not for the parents...|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	you probably cant find any info coz its not really something that people do. Why dont you and your wife have a baby shower with both men and women invited? That way its more about both of you and your baby, not just mum and bub? I mean, the only reason they have a baby shower for women is because she is the one that has the carry the baby and give birth, its not as easy as it may sound.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	really now. if you can't find anythin about it online, there could be a reason...|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	my husband and i are actually having a more manly babyshower.(when the time comes)  hes in the military and we are fairly new to ca. so he is invinting his who squadren out to a park(because our house isnt bigg enough) and my friend jes that lives by us and thats it. they can bring their spouses gifts encouraged and the guys are going to be able to drink and do just the guy thing. and then later that night (for the people who are sober) the guys are going to the dunes for some quad action. i love the idea considering im not too girly. just a big party not anything girly. no games or stupid stuff just gifts for the two of us to open and fun. hope this helped. and congrats on the little one!!
28WJwHf4aa	No, you don't feel pain. You are given an anesthetic which numbs your body. All you feel is some pressure and tugging. Not painful though.<br>  <br>  Some women require oxygen, but not all. It can be intense and some women can hyperventilate because it's overwhelming. If the baby seems to be under distress during the c-section, the doctors will also sometimes require the use of an oxygen mask. You are still able to breath, but getting a more forceful amount of oxygen can help relax both the mother and baby.|`|8ELfnTODaa	all i felt was a lot of tugging around. like nothing hurt but i could pretty much feel them opening me up. it was so freaky and they didn't put me on oxygen.|`|QwHHmJohaa	No that'ss not true, I have had two c-sections.  I didn't need an oxygen mask for either one of them.   There is a slight pressure on your abdomen when they are cutting and pulling the baby out, but besides that no pain.    The one thing that really bothered me (that I wished someone would have told me) is that when they give you the block you feel like your partial trapped in your own body.  That freaked me out a little at first.  You also can't hold your baby after its born until the meds wear off... so that stinks.|`|eya1WDS4aa	the normally only put an oxygen mask on you if your not awake durning the c -section. i had an emergency c section and i had an oxy mask on. the dr said it was for a few reasons. One being that a reaction could happen from the anesthesia---(sp) two being during emergency c sections they try to get the baby out as fast as possible so if something happens to the mother its easyer for her to get air.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i had nasal oxygen (no full mask)<br>  <br>  i never felt like i was choking or couldnt breath. or pressure on my chest. if you felt that then maybe it is a reaction from the epidural. or whatever drugs they were administering through your iv. <br>  <br>  you do feel a lot of pressure and tugging and pulling when they are taking the baby out, but other than that you shouldnt be feeling anything.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I never needed an oxygen mask, the pressure from them taking the baby out is kinda weird, kinda made me feel like I was being punched a little bit in the tummy.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	That is the weirdest thing I've heard about c-sections. I had two and yes you do feel a lot of pressure and pulling but nothing to where you feel like you're choking and can't breathe. I had oxygen both tomes but it was only because my babies where under stress. My first was a premie and I had preeclampsia with him. Now my second had the cord wrapped around his neck. You do get oxygen but I thonk if I remember correctly its for the babys health. And yours too.  <br>  Talk to your docotor if you have questions about a c-section, he will give you better info and calm your fears. <br>  Hope I helped.

But punishment is a form of discipline|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	punishment is the consequences of your actions.<br>  <br>  discipline is using the correct punishment so that the child will learn their lesson and correct the bad behavior.<br>  <br>  did you learn your lesson and are you going to do it again?<br>  <br>  addition: i suggest you have a grown up talk with your parents about the lesson you've learned and that you won't do it again. It's possible that if you show responsibiliy and man-up to what you've done, they might be more lenient with your punishment (and don't ever betray their trust again!)|`|RSczEcZCaa	lol! how long will this punishment/discipline last? o boy i pity you (but enjoys reading your questions!), but i guess what you should do is after reading my answer, to shutoff your computer and do what they tell you.

Just be home in time okay? good luck :)|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Discipline basically means to teach or train for something which can happen in various different forms. Where as punishment isn't suppose to teach, they're just angry and want to make you suffer for something you did.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	4 months is a lot. but you deserve some type of punishment|`|34VfDyuyaa	i think it's discipline through punishment.<br>  <br>  discipline has many ways, one is punishment.<br>  harsh punishment though, with your situation.<br>  <br>  just be a good seventeen year old boy and accept the punishment, or discipline.<br>  think about it, you must have worried them by being out 4 hours past your curfew, and you didn't even call them to tell them that you're fine.<br>  <br>  so long as you behave and follow the punishment or discipline, then you'll be fine, maybe they'll shorten your groundation.|`|j3YRIJafaa	you done sonething wrong therefore you are being punished, your parents think that by putting you to bed early and not letting use your stuff and have you on a strict routor will help you see your ways thats discipline and by the sounds of it, it is working lol.<br>  so yh there is a difference - punishment is to do with u and discipline is to do ith your parents!<br>  just stick to everything they say and it will be over because they think you have learnt your ways and look like your enjoying it then they will realise this isnt a punishment to you anymore lol - hope this helps
prqrQcd1aa	well, you must have done something to earn it! Eh... just deal with it for now, you should have known better.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Okay, what's the question here?

Seriously, I didn't read the whole story, but trust me, you would punish your child the same way if she did that!  I know you probably don't think so now, but I have a baby girl now, and if she did some of the crazy things I did, I'd punish her the same way my parents did!  trust me!  When you have kids, you'll understand.

I go until between 2-4 am.  I actually remember having to go to bed by 10 at that age, and that was when I wasn't in trouble.  I think weekends it was 12 though.  Just listen to your parents.  It won't be long and you will be on your own, and able to do what you want to do.|`|j3YRIJafaa	they are punishing you because you did something wrong, i wouldnt argue with them cos that will get you no where only going to bed at 8! so do as they say and it will be over with quicker cos when they see that you are obeying them they will think you have learnt your ways and lift the punishment off :D<br>  just when you go out next time be back on your curfew and keep in contact with them, i am sure if you tell them exactly where u are then they would let you stay out later - hope this helps|`|02fjVtsFaa	seriously what is your problem?

Focus on improving yourself and setting up a good life for your son<br>  3) Avoid your son's father for atleast 3 months.. thats usually how long it takes to get over somebody.<br>  4) find new people to hang out... reconnect with old friends.. find other new moms inyour society that you can discuss your experiences with.<br>  <br>  Honey you need change, and that will help you move forward and leave this Mean guy in the dust, because you deserve better|`|j3YRIJafaa	if you feel you havent got a hold in your life because of what has happened recently then i would say take a breath and forget about him for a while. by what you have said he sounds confused and doesnt where he is at with his life at the moment and he needs to figure that out in his own time, i wouldnt bug him or pressure him just focus on spending time with your son, and when he figures his life out and sees which direction he wants to go in then he will, you will hurt for a while at the moment but in time these pains heal so just get through each day and completely focus on your son and he'll figure it out - hope this helps xx|`|mMPVZ0Zmaa	I went through something similar a year ago. I had dated this guy for 2 years, he played mind games and was constantly lying to me the whole time. Almost literally after I told him I was pregnant (with him of course) he left me for someone else. The only difference is he completely tore of contact from me. So I have been a single mom from the start.<br>  <br>  The most advice I can give you is to let him know you cannot mentally handle this. Put some space between you two until you feel better. No baby deserves to be caught in the middle of love games anyways. Down the road limit your conversations with him to being only about your son. This will help you get over him. You will find someone new! I know exactly how you feel. It is so hard, but just know that everything will be alright in the end.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Listen, you are better than this, and you deserve to be with someone who can give you a straight answer and not play mind games with you. Move on and heal, take care of your self and your son, and when the time is right..someone will come around that is actually worth your time!
prqrQcd1aa	It is possible, i've done it myself before. Yes it does take time to heal.. and yes it could be kinda painful at first, but eventually you will get over it all. You will see him as just your child's father and nothing more. Just be shure to try to be civil with eachother for the sake of your child.|`|AA11735666	I'm only 19 years old, so my answer may not mean so much to you, depending on your age, but I dated this guy off and on for like 5 years!

So, his dad said he had to break up with me because he needed to keep his mind on his schooling if they were going to pay that much money for it.  And I didn't want to crush his dreams of going to a good college, and getting the best job for him, so I understood.  But I felt like I would never ever stop hurting from it.  So, I know how you're feeling right now.  BUT, now, 5 years later, I'm engaged to a wonderful man, and we have a beautiful baby girl together, and I'm over him.  Time really does work magic!

However, I don't think it will help you dilate.<br>  <br>  On the opposite side of the spectrum, sex could also initiate labor.  The movements, contractions from orgasm, etc.<br>  <br>  You might want to check with your OB to make sure it is still "safe" for you to have sex before you have it though.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	I believe this is to be somewhat true but in the latter part of the pregnancy..good luck!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I believe the rumor is his sperm will soften the cervix. <br>  <br>  Go ahead girl and have some fun nights!!!!! =)<br>  <br>  Congrats & Good luck!!!|`|C5ZocttQaa	actually it is true.....the mans seaman softens the cervix and helps u dilate....which can speed up the process of labor|`|HclKftzAaa	when they want to soften and dilate you cervix, they have this gel that they put on it. Interestingly enough, the stuff that is in that gel is a synthetic version of some of the chemical components of sperm!<br>  <br>  So yes, biologically, sperm can help soften and dilate the cervix.<br>  <br>  When a woman orgasms, she produces oxytocin- this is the same as the synthetic hormone they give you by drip to induce contractions.<br>  <br>  Also, during orgasm your uterus contracts. It is thought that this movement can help stimulate real contractions.<br>  <br>  You are far enough along that i wouldn't worry about accidentally inducing labor, so, if you're in the mood, go for it! :D|`|2HETgiwgaa	Prostaglandin - which is what they may give you to help "ripen" your cervix if you need an induction - was first isolated from human semen - so there is fact behind what you've been told.<br>  <br>  Unless you've been told to avoid it, you'll be fine having as many "fun nights" as you like - and, if/when you're passed your due date - it's a fun way to try and hurry things along.<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	There is something in the male ejaculant that can help dilate and or soften the cervix. It has to build up for 4 or 5 days to be strong enough though. No sex no masterbation or any form of release. Yes it is true. If  you want to dilate have him hold off and then after 4 or 5 days have intercourse and let the semen sit on your cervix for as long as you can stand! It should help. I'm trying to do that now actually (not RIGHT now) but at this time in my pregnancy.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	yes my midwife told me its true. if your 35 weeks then it would be ok to go into labour at that point :)

I'd put the cots next to each other. They've been sharing a space for so long, they'd become anxious being at opposite ends to each other. Your babies being born at 29 weeks gestation is still good, so don't worry too much. A baby can survive born at 22 weeks gestation - My cousin was born at 22 weeks gestation 33 years ago and technology has moved on a lot since then - So holding out to 29 weeks is brilliant. A little time in hospital to help their little lungs mature, and they'll be home before you know it. I had no idea you were a teen mum until you mentioned it just now, so that's testament to how mature you are. I commend your bravery.

ciz0qYwnaa	Honestly I think you're just a normal person like the rest of us. You have your own opinions and beliefs (and you share many of mine), and you are fully entitled to them. I think you are strong-willed and a bit stubborn. <br>  <br>  I also believe every woman has the right to choose whether she wishes to keep the child or not. Abortion might be needed in extreme times (when the woman's family threatens to kick her out if she doesn't lose the embryo and similar cases). But I also think the embryo's father should at least give his opinion on it. He should try whatever he can to preserve that life and care for it, not just run away like most of the teenage dads do. Preferably the pregnant would could give birth to the child and put it up for adoption, but if she chooses abortion that's fine. I'm pro-choice. <br>  <br>  Hitting for children might be bad, but it tends to differ. My brother has never been hit severely in his life, whereas I have many times while I was a child. Now I'm docile and disciplined, whereas my brother is rude and hot-headed and spoiled. Hitting and spanking might help correct a child's ways so that he/she will seem more civilized in the future - that's my case. And for hitting older kids... I don't think it will have much affect over them. I'm 15 and I already forgot the last time I got hit. I know if my parents were to hit me again I'd just storm into my room and let is pass. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in God either. At least not the god written in the bible. I think there might be a supernatural force out in the abyss somewhere, but I don't think it's a god. I believe in science. I believe the creation of the world was caused by the Big Bang, not by the Jewish god. I believe that we humans came from evolution, not from Adam and Eve. <br>  <br>  Love has no race... So truly said. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I think it's a good thing to command respect from your peers, but don't be too stubborn with it. However if you're comfortable with that, do whatever you please and don't listen to me ( :|`|2QvIM81Haa	I dunno if I would want to be friends with you.. "I've made out with friends boyfriends behind their back."<br>  <br>  Offense intended when I say you seem like a backstabbing b*tch..<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  And a control freak... "My friends won't talk back to me, because they know I'll always win no matter what it is."|`|XOnSRoR2aa	I think you're a bit of a paradox. You seem to be so incredibly confident and self-assured in some ways, and yet you're asking us for validation of your beliefs and actions and what we think about you, which is contradictory to the boldness of some of your points and behavior.<br>  <br>  We all contradict ourselves a bit and have our vulnerabilities. I think you are trying very hard to stand out and appear to be going against the grain, but really you just want to be accepted and assured that you're fine. That's okay. Deep down we all want to be accepted. When you are younger you mainly accept the values and beliefs of your parents and those surrounding you, and don't really challenge them, but in your teenage years it's natural to start forming your own belief system, asserting your opinions, and testing the waters a bit. You feel very strongly about some things, and your feelings are likely to keep evolving. Some of the things I had such strong convictions about at 15, such as being agnostic, I've completely changed my mind about in the past two years (I'm very much rooted in Christianity now, which is the faith I was brought up with and broke away from at 13-15). It's healthy and important to be an independent thinker, and it sounds like that's what you are. I don't agree with all of your beliefs, but that really doesn't matter. You are entitled to your own opinions, and I am mine. Just remember that even though you may feel incredibly strongly about something it doesn't necessarily mean that you right and everyone else is wrong. Be willing to listen to what others have to say. It's a sign of maturity, and people will have far more respect for you and be willing to listen to what you have to say if you treat them with the same courtesy. <br>  <br>  My only real objection is to some of your behavior towards others. I believe that everyone should do their best to follow the golden rule, and I very much doubt that you would appreciate it if your friends made out with your boyfriend (or girlfriend) behind your back, or if they always insisted that they were right and you were wrong and you needed to shut up and listen to them. You would probably feel hurt and used if guys dated you out of pity or to boss you around and make you their b*tch. I believe in karma, and all the toxic behavior and cruelty to others is bound to come back and bite you. You may find temporary satisfaction in what you're doing, but eventually you will up very lonely. <br>  <br>  I get annoyed with my parents all the time, but one thing that I've learned is that the more you refuse to listen to them and think they are overbearing, the more they will see you as a teenage brat and come down on you. Throttle back on the attitude and you'll have a happier home life. It's totally fine to not know what you want to do with your life, and you'll probably have better luck figuring it out if you let people who love you guide you once and a while. <br>  <br>  And about respect...... You demand that others respect you before you respect them, but yet your behavior is not worthy of respect, so how is that going to get you anywhere? Treat others as you want to be treated, and give them respect, and oftentimes it will be reciprocated. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you. : )|`|o8uGsZxmaa	You should like such a ******<br>  <br>  I disagree on -<br>  <br>  -I believe every woman should have the right to an abortion if she chooses it. <<< Baby's have fingernails you know <3<br>  <br>  -I think spanking is wrong, although older kids who are too dumb to know right from wrong should be hit.<<< Violence is not the answer.<br>  <br>  -I've made out with friends boyfriends behind their back. <<< You sound like a backstabbing ******.<br>  <br>  -I don't listen to anyone who tells me to do something I don't want to do.<<< if you listen to people you might actually learn something.<br>  <br>  -My friends won't talk back to me, because they know I'll always win no matter what it is.<<<< You sound like a control freak<br>  <br>  -I only date guys for the hell of it, because I feel sorry for them, or because I know I could easily order them around and make them my *****.<<<< That's horrible :( And again, you sound like a control freak.<br>  <br>  Do you like making people's life a living hell?<br>  Your friends are probably scared of you.<br>  <br>  Thats my opinion of you,<br>  <br>  Good day =D|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	You asked for opinions on me:<br>  1.

6zeZwQL6aa	My son is 17 months old and he has a lot of fun playing with a soccer ball in our driveway.  I kick it away from him and he runs after it.  He likes to watch the ball roll down the driveway.  But toddlers have really short attention spans too, unfortunately, so he'll probably be tired of it after a few times of that activity.<br>  <br>  The important thing is to take your son out and let him see as much as possible so he won't be bored.  He can even get a kick out of going to the grocery store if you let him walk because he'll be curious about everything there (but it's a hassle to monitor him all the time).  The park would be a good place to go (see if he's able to climb on the jungle gym and the swing is fun), or a petting zoo like someone already mentioned where touching is okay and he won't break anything.  A 17 month old is old enough to appreciate Chuck E Cheese.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't know any teaching games.  My son is learning the names of objects just by pointing at them and me saying the name repeatedly or learning foods and utensils during meals.

mgiJVjaKaa	The first time a girl has sex, it can alter her period a bit - especially with you guys having sex so close to her period. Wait a week, if she still hasn't had her period test again. But if the condom didn't break or leak (and you used it correctly) and it was only a couple of days before her period, it isn't very likely that she's pregnant.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Don't stress about it. It was her first time, so her body is changing. Plus sometimes when you have sex right before the period comes on.. it can make it come a little later.<br>  <br>  If you use a condom, didn't break or nothing.<br>  <br>  You're alright! Yall two don't stress too much!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	She would have been able to get pregnant on the 3rd. You ovulate 14days before your expected period.

But most likely she isnt pregnant good luck!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	chances are super low considering you used a condom and it didn't break, and the at-home test came back negative. but it COULD HAPPEN, do take another step and go to a doctor to find out for sure. I am sure she is probably stressing, which is causing her period to come later because it was her first time having sex, who knows. A doctor would be the best answer if she doesn't get it soon. Good luck to the both of you.|`|tHEBPDenaa	if you just had sex last week, even if she is pregnant it probably wouldn't show yet on a pregnancy test. however, it sounds like you had sex a few days before her period was due and girls are not very fertile at this time... you can get pregnant any time of the month but the middle of her cycle is when her chances are highest. if you had sex a few days before her period is due, the chances are low that she would get pregnant (although they're still there). <br>  <br>  stress plays a huge role is delaying your period. if she's stressed about the chance of being pregnant, this could be the reason her period is late. <br>  <br>  also, i'm assuming she isn't on the pill and unless she's on the pill, her period probably won't come at the exact same time every month. <br>  <br>  if i had to guess, i would say she isn't pregnant but there's no way to know for sure. wait another few days and if she still doesn't have it, take another test. my advice would be to go on the pill though and use a condom as well. then you won't have to worry and her period will come at the same time each month so you won't have to wonder!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
Coc593Ikaa	Insert Tab A into Slot B. Retract. Repeat until satisfied with result.<br>  <br>  ADD: Seriously though, do research on ovulation and start keeping track of your periods. Once you know how long your cycles are and when to expect another one, you can subtract 2 weeks from you next period to get an approximate ovulation time. Have sex every day or every other day for the week leading up to ovulation and then for a few days afterward. You may want to look into ovulation predictor kits to determine more accurately when you will ovulate. Or you can track your body temperature. There is too much info to cram in here. So do some googling!|`|3tVFWlqhaa	i think your only young , if you are you need to talk to someone about u wanting a baby|`|f18db9d59efe37b3f719816f9f8bea25aa	Frankly, if you're not sure what it takes to get pregnant, I'm not sure that we need you pro-creating in the first place.|`|XoRkPaa1aa	How old are you?

You might only have one ultrasound during pregnancy, most likely two though (dating scan at around 12 weeks then one at about 20 weeks to check growth and that everything is going okay). The dating scan is usually the one that will give you a due date if you weren't sure of the conception date or your last period date.

I feel that the only ones in that list that show towards a "bratty" child is where they are rude, hit, or refuse to share. The rest are actually normal signs of being a child. Your children throw tantrums when you don't give them what they want because they depend on you and love you and expect you to get them everything in life. You give them everything to begin with, then when they start to get old enough to do more on their own, it just takes them time to understand Independence.<br>  <br>  I would say throwing tantrums because you won't give them what their friends have is pretty normal, but giving in?

Pregnant women are very hormonal, and the least little thing can set them off. As far as the weight issue goes, pregnant women are feeling bad already knowing that they are going to get huge, and never look the same again already, then you just threw fuel on the fire. Looks like you're the one that got burnt. Didn't your parents always tell you not to play with fire!<br>  If you want her back, you will have to lose the attitude, gain some compassion and understanding, and give her whatever she wants, and needs. You are going to have to pay child support no matter what, so you might as well try your best to get back in your baby's mama's life, so that you can spend time with your baby.|`|J8tYQZ4gaa	yopu may think she is fat but no women wants to hear that its rude and mean especially if you said it in a mean way mabye if you said "baby your gaining a lil bit of weight" and it shouldnt matter about her size if she has a great personality it shouldnt matter. so if i were you and you want her back plan something romantic to apologize to her and tell her how beautiful she is!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Either you are joking to get a rise out of people or you are a real thick headed asswhole....

First she is pregnant and cant diet so its not going to do any good and will just make her feel worse than she already does.  Second, you are right, she does know if she is over weight or not and she doesn't need you telling her.  Instead go on walks together or hint towards some things that she could do so that SHE feels better about herself.  <br>  She gave up on you when you let her go for a month.  You didnt seem to care about her for a month why should she care about you when its good timing for you?  She has moved on you need to let her go.  <br>  <br>  By the way a great man does not call his pregnant girlfriend fat!!!

And the stress of getting the actual piercing wouldnt be good for baby either.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	I would avoid it, simply because your immune system isn't normal right now and it could take a very long time to heal and open you up to infections.

Just don't chance it! Your hormones and body are all over the place so the chances are you will be more prone to infection.

Just wait until after your baby and have it as a treat!

Don't overdo the jazz thing.  One is enough.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend you give him a somewhat "normal" middle name that he can use if he doesn't like Myles.  You need to have a very confident personality to feel comfortable with a unique and anachronistic name, and not everyone has it.  The last thing you'd want to do as a parent is give them a name they're embarrassed by.<br>  <br>  (I know that sounds like a downer, but I remember a kid I went to highschool with who was named Reginald, and he was a skinny shy guy who was literally embarrassed to introduce himself, and I always felt sorry for him because he just wasn't confident enough to wear a name like that with pride)|`|swL7bQfAaa	Samuel.<br>  <br>  Both Christian and Surnames are slightly unusual, you need a more balanced and slightly more common name to put in the middle.<br>  <br>  I am a lover of Unusual names for children, but believe they should have a choice of a more common name in the middle if they wish to use it later in life.<br>  <br>  I actually love all your choices.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Myles Lawson Desoto<br>  Myles Everett Desoto<br>  Myles Evander Desoto<br>  Myles Lucas Desoto<br>  Myles Linkin Desoto<br>  Myles Rylan Desoto<br>  <br>  i like all of these combos. :)|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Myles Davis<br>  <br>  Myles Patrick<br>  <br>  Myles Anthony|`|k8sukeTbaa	Myles Eli sounds good.

Levi and Eli both flow phonetically, but rearranging the letters in levi spells evil, and that's a bad omen.  Eli flows, but I actually think Myles Elijah sounds much better, it just rolls off the tongue.  Cruz is a no go, it doesn't flow to have 1-syllable first and middle names that both end with the same sound, especially an "s" or "z" sound.  I think Myles Ian (pronounced E-an) sounds good as well, but Myles Elijah is my suggestion, say it over and over and it sounds like some exotic resort near the Taj Mahal.|`|Hd6xrTU7aa	I like:<br>  Myles Jay<br>  Myles Geoffrey<br>   and Myles Coltrane.|`|7708161c5408392d4a303b97b60f207faa	I like Eli, but I like the previous suggestion of Lucas also.

As long as you are aware of boundries of the world and you set them you'll be fine.  Be strong and confident as you are already.  And be like a duck and let the water roll of your back.

ZSBZ83Dpaa	From what you tell here it is not possible to disentangle the psychological background of the preference you feel for older men. The fact that your dad left your family when you were 10 may have to do with it, but not necessarily so. Be that as it may, I can tell you that many young women feel attracted to men who are a little (or even more than a little) older, for reasons that you have stated and also because an older man may provide more security and confidence. So there is nothing wrong with you in that respect. And as you get older yourself the age difference won't be as big any more.<br>  <br>  But being abused is a whole different story. From what you say you just feel attracted to this guy but not to being abused. You should definitely stay clear of anyone who has an alcohol problem combined with a problem of verbal or real violence. That can only lead to disaster. These men never change. If you like men older than yourself, there are quite a few nice ones around who will love to be kind to a young woman, and you should definitely go for that type of man. No woman is made to be abused. Some women unfortunately learn to live with an abuser, but please don't join their ranks!<br>  All the best to you!|`|FuUQ0ofraa	just know there are guys out there how will treat you how you want to be treated. And nobody deserves to be abused. Just say NO I will not put up with that!|`|IH0kLuwZaa	its mental thing that i've been trying to figure out for the longest. some parts f you likes the attention even if its not good .. you  self sabotage your self and tricked yourself into thinking that you can't do any better so you put up with crazy crap you just have to tell yourself everyday that you deserve better until you start to believe it and once you Truly believe it you won't allow any man or woman disrespect you in that matter|`|eba4f73f341b0091df25945e8ca17ed4aa	No one deserves to be treated like that, and though you may feel protected by him, you aren't. He is the one harming you, and even though it will be very hard, you need to end it or you could be seriously injured, and if he is really bad, killed. You need to end it and it will be very hard, but you may not want to be in person with him when you end it, because he might be drunk. Just make sure you do end this because you do NOT deserve to be treated like this.|`|j3YRIJafaa	there are all kinds of abuse - verbal, physical and sexual are the main ones. the reason you keep going back to him is because you feel you need him to be yourself and keep you going, no woman needs a man to be herself, it sounds to me like something in your life has made you feel like this, and it is likely to be what happened with your dad, i would end it with the guy i know this is going to be very hard but you have to do it no one should be treated like this! then re-connect with some friends and go out with them, spend more time with your dad and get some hobbies, join a few clubs stuff like that and forget about him and this need for older men and focus on yourself and your life - hope this helps good luck x|`|prqrQcd1aa	Please go get some counseling, you are already an abused woman!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	The 40 year old should be in Jail, and Older Men are NOT Better, you just haven't found one your age yet who has your same interests. YES you are on your way to being an abused woman. Get help now. The 30 year old has a drinking problem, and you don't WANT to be with someone who is an alcholic. He is the one who is immature if he can't handle his anger or his alchohol. For God Sakes date someone your own age...THEY ARE out there. Look for them!|`|HclKftzAaa	you have abandonment issues. Because your father left when you were so young, you are desperate for approval from father figures, and the only way you know how to do that is sexually. I would go to counseling so that you can sort out these issues before you get into your first relationship.Once you start adding sex to the equation it will only get more difficult.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	If you aren't careful you'll fall into a pattern of only being attracted to men who treat you poorly. There's nothing wrong with liking older men, often they ARE more mature and treat you better. But when it comes down to it, the only thing that matters any in relationship is respect. If the man that you're with doesn't respect you enough to not hit you then he's not worth your time and effort. Men like that will often say "I don't mean it and I won't do it again" and then do anyway. You're better than that and you shouldn't have to feel like you have to stay with someone that can't control himself.<br>  Make a rule for yourself and don't break it. If he hits you, leave and don't go back. No matter what. And make sure that ANY man that you hook up with knows from the first date that you will do the same!|`|R8fVBPnmaa	That's mostly correct I'm fairly certain of that !?! If an OLDER guy had a cute young thing.,. a.k.a.(PYT <pretty-young-thing> for one there just may be something about your personality that he also M I G H T like `bout you !?!..But do not foget.. 7 depending on age differences most times: A younger female is for the most-part a TROPHY  for him to brag on !! & or show off amongst the guys/[his so`,called ?friends?!?!  But ofcouse there's almost always some older gentlemen that will treat whoever she might be that may be his romantic intrest !?! LIKE A QUEEN !!! just do'nt forget `bout any stories you've heard of the fractions that are USED,ABUSED treated like crap  etc. !!! & G/L to you ~!!!   r'`R`'r|`|ntdGOZqGaa	First off I think that you have to understand that if a man loves you he will never ever raise a hand to you ever. That is disrespectful and shows that he doesnt care to much about you if he can hurt you like that. If you want to be abused you will be if you let it happen. No one has to put up with anyone hitting them, if it happens more then once its your fault for staying there and putting up with it. And why would a 40 year old man be kissing a 14 yr old girl? Your mom was very right for having you on lock down, I wouldnt let my daughter out of my sight lol. I dont think there is anything wrong in dating older men if that is your thing then its your thing, you are a grown women and can date whom ever you want. Hope you dont let a man disrespect you or ever put his hands on you bc no one deserves that. Good luck

692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I was taught never to pop mine for 2 reasons, it will leave scars and poppingthem spreads the bacteria which prevents it from healing and causes new ones.. i know its hard to resist though.  Just picture your face full of craters when you grow out of acne.. maybe that will help...  i say just pop the huge ones that are noticably big, and immediatly follow with a cleanser that will clean up the bacteria, you can get little packaged ones to carry around with you.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	My older sisters are like that, but I found I only got the urge around that time of the month, LOL, when I was hormonal.  When you get the urge, remind yourself that they will go away faster and not look as bad if you leave them alone.  Some need to be drained, for pain purposes, but most will just get worse and take longer to go away if you fuss with your skin all the time.  Also, try looking in the mirror less throughout the day.  Hard to pop them if you can't see them.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It's pretty normal. I got it from my mom, she used to get rid of mine and now I just CANNOT leave my pimples alone! They can scar, but a good way to minimize that is to use cotton tips instead of your fingers to squeeze them as it reduces the damage you do to your skin.<br>  If you want to avoid doing it altogether, try using a cleanser and toner to clear your skin so that you at least have less to be tempted by :)|`|gWiZAsfBaa	It's normal. My sister is like that too. After a while she couldn't stand looking at people with pimples and not having the urge to pop it. I'm serious about it. She couldn't control it and yes, some of them do leave scars. She finally stopped it through sheer will, but she admits there are times when she still feels the urge to do it if she sees someone with a big enough pimple.|`|I2lEkHJ9aa	ok, STOP PICKING AT YOURSELF!!!! yes, you will leave scars. anything can become a habit. this is obviously a really gross one. and really bad for your skin. every time you "pop" a pimple you are opening yourself up for a way for infections to enter your body. just don't do it anymore. when you get the urge do something else to distract you. good luck....

CSzDV3gEaa	if they know you and pay attention then yes.|`|A3zAXntxaa	If your eyes are as red as the Devils d*ck. But yeah, you'll probably smell like pot and your eyes will be red. Unless your parents are clueless.<br>  <br>  <br>  (LMFAO, don't take that Devil thing seriously, it's from Pineapple Express.)|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	They would be able to tell and not just from your blood shot eyes and the fact that you will most likely smell like pot. They will be able to tell from the way you act, trust me. I meet people at parities talk to them for a few minutes, they go away and smoke some pot, and when they come back I can so tell and I have only known them for an hour and your parents have known you your whole life. <br>  <br>  The high normally last a few hours, its like 3 to 5 hours for me. It depends on the quality of the weed and how much you smoke of it. Also if its your first time you don't always get high, and if you do you will be very sleepy.<br>  <br>  Wait... are you talking about just pot or like other drugs, you didn't really say so I just assumed you were talking about pot.|`|ynAXDyQDaa	Unless they are oblivious and were never teenagers themselves, yes they will be able to tell if you were high. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|msNXomjTaa	Yup; there is a very good chance of it - from physical changes (eyes, etc.) but also behavior.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	if your parents paid attention to you then yes|`|RBOc42Koaa	if your smoking weed, which i'm guessing you are, you can tell by:<br>  red eyes<br>  smell of breath<br>  smell of clothes<br>  and smell of hair<br>  <br>  <br>  if your smoking weed, and going home, go straight to your room..and say something like "i'm tired, night" or something, so they will leave you alone.<br>  <br>  when you smoke weed bring along eye drops.<br>  if at a house when smoking, take a shower...but if you can't, just spray a bunch of perfume shiz on.<br>  <br>  if it's your first time getting high, you probably won't feel anything.<br>  I didn't feel anything until like the 6th time i did.<br>  if it's not, which i'm pretty sure it is since your asking this question, then the high could last anywhere from 3 hours to 7 hours.<br>  that depends on if you're outside, how much you smoke, and if you smoke it right...if you are smoking it.<br>  there's a lot of different ways to do it, just so you know.<br>  <br>  <br>  do you even know how to smoke weed?<br>  because when i first started..i had nooooooo idea how to get high well. haha.|`|gT31DB1caa	i spent all of my teenage years doing what i want because i thought my parents were stupid and wouldn't know then i became a parent myself your parents always know what is going on with you and what you have been doing behind their back it is just to what extent do they choose to ignore it ...|`|oxriDchOaa	Depends on who you are, how you react and how much you smoke.  Lots of people don't feel it at all the first time they smoke.  Some people get totally baked.<br>  <br>  To be safe, give yourself five hours or so between when you plan on smoking and when you plan on seeing/talking to your parents.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	yes your parents will notice.<br>  being high lasts up to 3-6 hours.<br>  i pretty sure your parents arent that dumb to tell when there son is high. so not smart to get high then go home... not smart to get high at all. U should research about geting high and what it actually does to your body.|`|NaYTDqmnaa	YES your eyes will get realy red and u will be very confused its kinda lyk being drunk only high|`|8oKazGVGaa	yeh they can tell! get white eyes|`|tyBG2O7vaa	no duh it lasts for at least 5 hours..
54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	A lot of women still get pregnant with PCOS... some need medical intervention (fertility drugs mostly) and others still manage to conceive naturally. PCOS isn't a fertility death sentence. If the time in your marriage isn't right for another baby, then give it a few more months and see if things get better.<br>  <br>  I'm 31 and I know that 'rushed' feeling all too well - but both of us still have time to complete our families. Having a baby at the wrong time can destroy your marriage and you can end up being a single parent to two small children. You should think about that.|`|afDDiHbXaa	why don't you carry on and deal with the fertility docs tell them you want a family coz if you stop it now it may take months before you get an appointment but just use condoms until your really sure that a baby is what you want at least that way your sorting your body out but not adding a baby to complicate things but not holding up fertility drugs etc i no how hard it is to get an appointment with fertility docs.|`|SLwl2k1raa	I have a lot of friends who have PCO and have gone on to have beautiful families. PCO isn't a death sentence, yes getting pregnant is going to be difficult but it doesn't mean it's never going to happen again. Adding another baby into an already strained marriage is only going to cause your family more stress than it needs right now. If your husband is already working two jobs and you are unemployed how are you going to support another baby? <br>  I hope this helps. Good Luck|`|1fbd8f6b9906fd503f3772b724af78d6aa	I have pcos and am 28 years old, I wouldn't add a baby to save a marriage. I would work on the marriage...strengthen it...then see if having another baby is something he wants to do and do it together. An unplanned pregnancy on a marriage thats already stressed and pocketbooks that are already stretched would just be more grief. PCOS is totally manageable. Change your eating habits to a gluten free low glycemic intake diet. Exercise. Take your metformin or glucophage as well as birth control of some form. Be healthy and manage your pcos and you can conquer it, I recommend Healing Syndrome O as a great uplifting book to help you out. Your time for having babies isn't over because you have PCOS unless you let the PCOS rule you. All else fails there are progesteron pills and shots as well as clomid which fortuneatly is on the $4 prescription list at wal-mart!|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	If ur not sure, dont do it.
RSczEcZCaa	How heartbreaking really. when my baby had tooth fracture from a bad fall he was in the same situation. it took us two weeks cuddling him every night while he cries. i suggest you give pain reliever before bedtime and gently introduce the bottle in his mouth while half-asleep. if this doesn't help, i think cuddling is the only way to go. weaning is also good but in my experience babies at this age drink less milk from a cup as oppose to bottles making them less nurtured.|`|7f9556755f69705a513723fb306b1046aa	Maybe you could find a very soft dummy somewhere:  I know they come in different textures so maybe a big shop like Boots would stock them.  Also try dabbing oil of cloves on his broken tooth before giving him a bottle:  that might numb the pain.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You need to contact his doctor and see what to do about this! How did he break his tooth? Make shure you are feeding him lots of foods that have high water content, and contact his doctor...maybe get him to suck on some ice chips and then try to give him his sippy cup.

cP0NnP6Oaa	yes you can still get pregnant. it does NOT stop ovulation. they active pills give you a hormone to "trick" your body to thinking your in  early pregnancy when your arent. the inactive pills dont have that hormone they are actually just sugar pills. so the lack of hormones tells your body your not preg. so you have your period|`|AA11538461	It is a controversial topic.  Back when I took the pill in the early 80's, all the doctors said it stopped ovulation.  Now they don't seem so sure.  If it does not stop ovulation, it is really an early abortion device.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Yes, you're right, the pill does stop you from ovulating.  If you take your pills perfectly you know there is always still a slight chance to become pregnant.  Every time you miss a pill there is more of a chance.  If you miss a pill and realize the next day then take that pill when you realize and take the next one (the one that actually should be taken this day) later in the day.  Then, you'll be back on schedule.  Hope that helps...

1vaqtRI2aa	The only way to know 100% if you're pregnant is if you take a blood test.<br>  <br>  Those symptons alone aren't enough to be pregnant- you could be PMSing or just have an upset stomach. Are you sensitive to smell? Have you gained weight? There are several other factors.<br>  <br>  So just go take a blood test- Take care!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Do you mean nausea? If the test showed positive, you are probably pregnant. Try taking another one.|`|iphheJkoaa	Maybe it's just a side effect from some excesses you where doing.

28WJwHf4aa	Wow. I highly suggest you stop having sex until you know the basics of it.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It was almost certainly cervical mucus from yourself, I wouldn't worry about it at all. If it looked like all of the sperm was still in the condom (and it wasn't leaking anywhere) then I'd say you're pretty safe :)|`|jYPeis3Saa	you could have been ovulating and that is just the discharge from it.<br>  <br>  i do suspect that you are too young to be having sex based on your question|`|zgKBpvsYaa	Not to scare you but condoms are typically 97- 98% effective.  That leaves you with 2- 3% chance of becoming pregnant.  But if you guys already checked the used condom and found no visible signs of a tear it sounds like he could have just made you came extra that day.  <br>  If you want to be 100% positive I would take a pregnancy test or go see a doctor and ease your worries.|`|6ybMmWHXaa	its chick juice get use to it (not kidding)|`|WU3iVaa0aa	I don't think that you would get pregnant this way.

First off, ignore those stupid people.<br>  <br>  There is a chance the condom had a small hole on it.  If that was the case, you wouldn't be able to see it necessarily.  But, that probably isn't what happened.  <br>  <br>  Normally, right before your cycle starts (and sometimes afterward) you can have some thickish, white vaginal discharge.  I'd be willing to bet that is what it was.  It doesn't happen all the time, so you might not be used to see it.  I know it doesn't with me, and I was in a similar situation.<br>  <br>  However, the thing that concerns me is you said it was sort of mucusy.  If you've been itching, it might be a sign of a yeast infection (or an oncoming one if you haven't had itching.)  So, eat you some yogurt for a couple of days to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  I don't think you have anything to worry about though.  If you are still worried after this, you can go to a convenience store and try to get a morning after pill.  Another option would be to call your local Health Department and see if they have "Plan B" pills.
HXrILdRwaa	How will we pay for treatment?<br>  <br>  Fertility treatment isn't cheap - the average cost of assisted reproductive techniques is $12,400 for a single try. Since many health insurance policies don't cover fertility therapies, check your policy carefully before you do anything. Currently, 14 states - Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia - require insurers to cover diagnosis and some treatments, but even within a state, policies can vary. For example, certain states cover fertility drugs but not assisted reproductive technology. Some financial institutions also offer loans specifically designed for fertility treatments. Check the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Web site for information about your state's laws.|`|1fbd8f6b9906fd503f3772b724af78d6aa	IDK but definitely not Georgia. My husband's employers switched to a new Cigna medical plan and it has not a signle penny of infertility coverage...our other one did...its so heart breaking.
tDyNwGdcaa	i went thru this when i was pregnant with my (now 2 and a half year old) daughter. my partner and i had been together forever and he just decided the whole thing was too much and he wanted greener pastures that could still party and hang out.<br>  <br>  he was a jerk and your ex is a jerk. any man who leaves his partner while pregnant is a jerk.<br>  <br>  if he didn't want the responsibility he shouldn't have put his bits there!<br>  <br>  i don't use this site often so not sure if there is a way ti private message but if there is and you need to talk please feel free to contact me.. my heart breaks for you because i know how it feels. :(<br>  <br>  still it is better to know now than have him do the dirty while you are trying to adjust to having your new little baby at home! (i took the twit back and he then cheated on me and is now trying to conceive with the other woman)|`|QwHHmJohaa	I'm not going through it now, but when I was pregnant with my daughter I did...  I'm not sure if you have family around, but if you do- embrace it!!  I didn't, and I didn't really have friends either because my (ex) boyfriend had kind of alienated me from them.  I just focused on my baby and how she was always there with me so I was never really alone.  You're close to having him or her, so focus on that and your beautiful miracle.  Soon you will be busy being a mom and your focus will change.  You don't need the love of someone who is willling to ditch you and your baby.  : )|`|GX1hvK8Yaa	Stick him with child support for 18 Years,get that guy back.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	That happened to my with my first baby. I was scared, depressed, lonely, you name it. I hated it. BUT, everything worked out, and now that whole time in my life is in the past and forgotten, and my son and I are happy and healthy! In my situation, the father saw our son a couple times when he was an infant and then moved across the country and hasn't seen him in 4 years. We got over it. Don't miss him at all!   Try not to let the break up get you down so you can enjoy your pregnancy. I didn't enjoy mine like I should've because I spent so much time wondering "what am I going to do????"  and "why'd he leave me??"    If you are feeling lonely you can email me!<br>  Good luck and keep your head up! You'll have a little baby soon that will put a smile on your face for the rest of your life!!!|`|TwVd0etQaa	Its bad that he has left you at such a hectic time in your life. Im only 6 and half weeks pregnant and split up with my boyfriend BEFORE i found out i was pregnant. It totally sucks and i still haven't told him yet. The best thing is i've got my mum who has been my rock. At this stage in your pregnancy i would try and concentrate mainly on the baby and taking care of yourself. Personally i wouldn't give your ex the time of day, to leave you now seems to me he is being a coward towards his responsibilities. Have you got family and friends who will support you ? E-mail me if you need to talk :)|`|7wFqVKk3aa	maybe you should have kept your legs closed
QluBTwCvaa	I would say that if your parents are really strict it is because they love you a lot.  If daddy is able to support you, get married. Couples who just live together have a 50% higher divorce rate if they do get married.<br>  Telling your parents will be the hardest part.  They may feel like they have failed you in letting this happen, like they have been poor parents. If your mother and father love children, they will love this one too.  I let my daughter struggle through telling me though someone else already had.  She just could not, so I said, "So when is the baby due?"<br>  <br>  If  your dad and mom are not physically abusive, you can tell them alone. I would tell just one of them, whichever is easiest for you and let that one tell the other, or go with that one to tell the other.<br>  <br>  If that still seems impossible to you or even dangerous tell your pastor or their pastor and let him help you tell them. Parents are strict with rules because they know how easy it is to get into a bad situation. The rules were for your protection. They probably will still want to protect you and the baby.  The father on the other hand had better watch himself and approach with caution.|`|1o3OqSioaa	First thing to do is to find a place to move in to with your baby's daddy while making wedding plans, since you are in love, and having a baby.<br>  Secondly, tell your parents that you are moving in with your fiancee while you are planning the wedding.<br>  Thirdly, plan a quicky wedding at the courthouse, it's cheap and quick.<br>  Now, tell your parents that you are pregnant. They will be thrilled that you are married, and now they are going to be grandparents. They may figure out that you were p.g before you got married, but now they won't care since you have done the mature, and responsible thing.|`|28WJwHf4aa	Writing a letter? No, don't do this. Just tell them. If you're going to be a parent, you're going to need to know how to handle things in a grown-up way.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Don't write a letter. Just be honest with them. Yeah they may get mad but they'll come around eventually. It is going to be their grandbaby after all. Especially if its the first.|`|OpoETyfoaa	talk to your mom on the phone and be like guess what... i am pregnent. dont be afraid u r old enough 2 make your own decisions. go for and good luck|`|2oIVTQEEaa	1st of all, both of you must be confident enough to face both of your parents.  You must be ready in any possible way that will happen. Defend each other.<br>  <br>  Okay, here you gonna do.<br>  Let the parents of the guy first know about it. How? both of you will face them. The guy will open up to his parents and then the two of you will apologize to them and explain everything that you did not mean it and prove to them that both of you will support each other.<br>   Next, set again a meeting for the side of the girl. If possible, if the parents accepted already, invite them to join for a help.<br>  <br>  Although, for the first few days, it is hard to accept for both of your parents but they have nothing to do but to support you. <br>  <br>  Be confident!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Forget the letter.  Don't do it over the phone.  Don't get an older couple to help you tell them or to tell them for you.<br>  <br>  While you're younger than I was when I had to tell my family about my little surprise, you should just be honest with them.  Try to find a time when you can all sit down, probably for a few hours, and have a discussion.  Depending on what they think of your boyfriend, you might want to have him there too, to show that he is supported and committed to you and your baby.<br>  <br>  One thing I did, was I went to my parents with a plan.  I was already living with my boyfriend and we'd been together for awhile, but we were living with roomies.  We had a nice laid out plan about moving out, him asking for more hours at work to start saving money.  If you're in college, or planning on going soon, consider taking online courses.  <br>  <br>  Just tell them that you know you're young, and that things might not have happened the way they would have wanted them to.  They might be mad, but someone had it right when they said you're still their daughter.  They should love you and be supportive.<br>  <br>  Hell, me and my mom got closer after the initial shock.<br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|cdad84533f0f36972e30b8b4ec80167faa	Oh my. Find a couple of older people (pastor, youth group leaders, etc) to help you tell them. They'll freak out, no doubt about that, but those older people can calm them down, talk to them and help them realize that you made a mistake, no one is perfect, and things will get better. Hope everything goes well.|`|QOcWKbmKaa	you need to sit down with them and just tell them no matter how hard it seems now it will be okay in the end.  the sooner the better.  They may be upset at first but they will get over it.  Its your decision and its too late now for them to do anything but accept it.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about it too much!!|`|V5W8jE5Yaa	do not write a letter...it would be a lot better to tell them asap cause the longer you wait the worst the outcome will be....and that is great that the dad is supporting you i know way too many mothers with kids that have no dads.remember asap!|`|J03Qy5aoaa	I'd suggest that you just be straightforward with them... the longer you try and hide it the worse it will be.  Furthermore, you're parents may be mad, but you are their daughter, they'll want to help.|`|dJ7xagFCaa	tell the truth, dont be scared, dont abort.<br>  at least you will be handling this in a mature way. and if ur 18, you CAN date. legally|`|wP6Pi7iZaa	You should go straightforward and tell them. You don`t have to tell them right away. But you should tell them before 3 months. YOu should probably call them.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	I don't think a letter or a phone call is a good idea for something this important, you need to tell them in person. You might want to write out a letter (for yourself not to give them) beforehand though just so you can kind of plan out what to say, but you should definitely tell them face to face. <br>  <br>  I would also not have the dad present when you tell them. They don't even know you're dating him or anything, I think it could make them (esp. dad if he's anything like most dads) even more upset. Have him available at his place though so you can call him for some support afterwards, or let him talk to your parents etc. <br>  <br>  This is going to be a LOT for them to adjust to and they may go kinda crazy especially at first so try not to take their initial reaction too seriously or get too upset about it. Hopefully in the long run they will be OK with it and support you.
zgKBpvsYaa	Hmmm... I highly doubt that extra fore skin has anything to do with your erection problem.  I would guest that you are nervous about having sex with this girl since you mentioned that she is a virgin.  You probably feel pressured to live up to a certain potential therefore lost your erection.  <br>  Unless your feeling pain from the tightness of the condom I wouldn't correlate that with being painful for her, but I would definitely try some lube on the girl.  Hope that helps.  Happy Humping!|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Well it sounds like your problem is that you can't handle things being too tight. A few thing to try that may help.....<br>  <br>  For the condom issue, if they are tight on you and hurting you, then you need to start buying Magnums or Magnums XL. And be happy about this because it means you are blessed ;) <br>  <br>  Second to help with your girlfriend, you need to engage in more foreplay. Do whatever you need to do to get her FULLY turned on. Make her need you! One thing that works, other than the obvious, is try having her lay on her stomach and kissing all over her back, neck and shoulders. It is a very sensitive spot for women. Doing this along with all other foreplay moves will not only make her more "lubed up", but it will also get her brain going and in return her vagina will relax. <br>  <br>  I don't know why you able to before but were you drinking with these other sexual partners? That would cause you to put the pain part of it away as your body isn't as responsive to it. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.
QaJGkXp2aa	7 and a half.<br>  <br>  33 weeks times 7 days/week = 231 days<br>  <br>  The average month is about 30.5 days<br>  <br>  231 divided by 30.5 = about 7.5<br>  <br>  You can't argue with that math! :)|`|HclKftzAaa	everyone has a different answer because there are a few ways to measure pregnancy length.<br>  <br>  The most common mistake is using 'lunar months'- or assuming a month is 4 weeks long. so most ppl will tell you you are 8 months one week. however, we ALL know that pregnancy is counted as 40 weeks/9 months.<br>  <br>  This is because a pregnancy CALENDAR month is actually 31 days long. (40 weeks x7 days = 280 days. 280 days divided by 9 months =31.1 days).<br>  <br>  So, if you are 33 weeks. 33 x 7 = 231 days.<br>  231 days/31 days= 7.45 <br>  <br>  you are therefore 7.45 months pregnant. (0.45 x 31 = 13.95 days)<br>  7 months 2 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  and yes you CAN say 'i am in my eighth month of pregnancy' but you are NOT YET 8 months. <br>  <br>  :D|`|rkSBHqtQaa	33 weeks would equal to 8 months 1 week.

7iwZRuUmaa	you are not pregnant. but you are definitely a hypochondriac.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	why did you right such a long essay!!!!!!!???????<br>  i could've bought 10 tests by now!<br>  dumbo!|`|Cu8svhwAaa	I don't think you're pregnant.  It does seem like you might have a UTI though.  Either that or a yeast infection. You should really make an appt to see the doctor so you can know for sure and be properly treated for it.|`|SLwl2k1raa	The only way to know for sure if your pregnant is to get a blood test from your GP. It doesn't sound like you are pregnant but I would definitely have a chat to your GP about your other symptoms. I think you are just being paranoid and reading too much into everything. Your symptoms could be totally unrelated to each other. <br>  I hope that helps. Good Luck.
QdIFhWjfaa	It's 6 weeks if there is no complications!<br>  Don't be silly and just wait, or you could get pregnant again|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	Usually its 6 weeks, but can be anywhere up to 3 months.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	you are supposed to wait 6 weeks|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Not till the child is taking breast feed.
2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Yes, you could be.  <br>  <br>  I was on the pill, but my periods were never really regular even on that.  I started two weeks after I ran out and had taken two pregnancy tests that came back negative.  I was taking my pills the whole time and even had some breakthrough bleeding for a few days, when a dream sparked me to take another that came out positive.<br>  <br>  From what the doctor told me, breakthrough bleeding is pretty common in the first month and can even go in to the second month.  The home pregnancy tests take about two weeks before they can even pick up on hCG levels.  On top of that, you can be like my friend and have had low hCG levels early on.<br>  <br>  With three coming back positive, you've got a great chance.  I'd make an appointment with an OB for a blood test and maybe an ultrasound.  That would be the best bet to figure out how far along you were.|`|AA10979033	You could be farther along then you think. By the way congrats on being prego:) I had the brown spotting and it was fine I was told that was old blood. The way they will find out forsure how far along you are is a ultrasound. Good luck and again congrats!!!! Babys are the best|`|ejHfqSD1aa	Yes, it is very possible you are further along. I would go to your doctor so the can do a sono and get the measurements and see how far along you are. Congrats and Good luck.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yes it could be positive you are further along than you are....the tests could of came back wrong, or it was too early to test. go to your doctor to get a blood test done, then you will know for sure. good luck.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	I would go to your doctor. That sounds very confusing.
SA1y0lm1aa	ive had 2 c section my last one was a year and a half ago ... answer to your question you asked me........... now how long ago was your last c section... ok update i have an evil uti... fist one hurts like freeeeking hell... help me any ways i was looking up on the internet and they said if you have a lot of blater infections and uti s and then dont have one it might still hurt and your doc might need to give you and all the time anitbiotic to keep them from comeing back and in 2 months you could be all better.... ask your doc about that|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	you've just got to get to a doctor, who knows
3F8f1SoQaa	it sounds like you are a little worried about his behavior and development. The best thing you can do is to contact your local early intervention program and ask for a developmental eval. They may ask you if you have any specific concerns, and it is OK to say "no...I just want to make sure that he is on track". If by some chance he DOES have any sort of delay, they will tell you how to get free or low cost therapy that he needs.<br>  <br>  my youngest got into EI at 24 months old for a speech delay. He was involved for a year ( until he turned 3). He got monthly visits with an intervention specialist where she played with him one on one for an hour, he went to a music specialty group where most of the kids were speech delayed, he got 2x per week individual therapy and probably $700 worth of therapy tools. they also helped him get into special needs preschool when he was too old for EI anymore. He ADORES preschool and has done better than I expected for the youngest of 3 kids who has been home with mom his whole life.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	First of all, being a stay at home mum has absolutely nothing to do with speech development!!!!!  My eldest daughter spoke in full sentences at that age, and complex ones at that. My son did not speak until he was 3. I was a stay at home mum for the whole of that time, so there is no truth in that whatsoever.<br>  <br>  My son, 3 and a half now, will not sit and "learn" anything either. You should just be playing with him to be honest. Even at the first year of school the curriculum is play based. Sing heads shoulders knees and toes, and get some instruments/shakers (if you don't have any, make some with him). He'll pick it up better that way.<br>  <br>  Also, just another thought, does anyone in your family wear glasses?? Maybe worth getting his sight checked. We thought my son might have a hearing problem, but we knew something was wrong, and it was his sight.|`|yDdGoYLJaa	Hi there. I was just wondering how he interacts with you and other people? Do you get smiles out of him? Does he kiss you and is he affec affectionate with you? Also, does your son make eye contact?|`|1WBimx1laa	I am not trying to scare you but my daughter is speaking almost full sentences and she is not even 2 yet. My friend has a 5 year old little boy that was diagnosed with Autism or ADHD and they seemed to act the same way you are describing. I would highly suggest taking him to his pedetrician and see what he has to say. TEll him all of this.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i have a 17 month also. he is startin to throw bad temper tamturms :( he understands no, and has started shakin his head with it. he mimics the sign we do for "all gone" hehe. he has just started to wave bye bye and has said it a few times. he says no and of course mommy and daddy and every version inbetween and even his sisters name. but he doesn't have a very large vocabulary. i was told at the 15 month visit about 5 or so words is average. he has learned where his tummy is, but thats it. he does get involved with tv, i do have to really watch how much time its on, because he gets totally engrossed and doesn't even hear us when we call him. at this age i think there is just so much to see and do, he has realized thathe can see on the table and bathroom sink. so anything within reach is fair game! still having trouble keepin him outta the toilet and dog and cats water dishes, hehe. but from the sounds of it to me, your son is doin just fine :)|`|AA11270223	<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/04/040406090140.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <br>  Read this article, and then think about your question.  Are you willing to risk your child's future?  ADD/ADHD does NOT have a cure, and any medication you can give them for it only "helps" it doesn't totally "fix" the problem.
Xrwvu5Uraa	You need to apply for Medicaid in your state. Go to your states department of human services website and you will find information about it there. Most likely, you will have to go to your local DHS office and fill out paperwork and such. You will need certain information but the website will list all of that information. Just in case you do not know what Medicaid is, it is insurance for low/no income people and/or pregnant woman. It is goverment aide to help you with healthcare during your pregnancy. Good luck to you & congratulations on the baby.|`|m8d2r3ctaa	just go get a job u old enough for one|`|1U7yLEf9aa	You need to get on government insurrance (medicare) in tennesse it's tenncare. Call the health department and they will tell you all about it. It's free and there are no copays. It's not meant to last forever though. Just until you can get on your feet. Good luck. Congratulations
P7q9cNaiaa	If she isn't your girlfriend I wouldn't have sex with her. You want your first time to be meaningful. That's just my opinion though. And yes, if you ARE going to have sex, definitely use a condom. If you don't know how they have instructions in the box!! I would really rethink this though!|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Figure out how to use one.<br>  <br>  See if she's on birth control.<br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse.<br>  <br>  Roe v. Wade.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	lmao this has got to be a joke<br>  hehehehe|`|tOIz5WB3aa	Don't do it, you sound too immature.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	obviously you aren't ready if you don't know how to properly use a condom. wait until you are ready.|`|8oKazGVGaa	practice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with both
AA10979033	When you go to that first ultrasound and see that little baby is when it kinda hits. When you start feeling pregnant is about 3and half 4 months you can start feeling a little fluttering feeling. Then you start feeling kicks and flips. Right down every little moment that you wont want to forget somewhere down the road and i would take a belly pic every month i didnt do alot of that stuff and its sad when you start to forget. Congrats sweetie Im so happy for you. Good luck and God bless you and your little baby.|`|mGzYQvJIaa	you feel always dizzy when youre pregnant|`|FinoWunOaa	im 24 weeks and I dont feel pregnant until baby starts kicking lol|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I started to really feel pregnant around week 20.<br>  <br>  What do you mean was it your first ultrasound? Do you mean when is? Normally around weeks 10-12.<br>  <br>  I had morning sickness in the beginning really bad...and no appetite. There are many symptoms and each woman doesn't experience them all. Good luck to you.|`|2nqmoerIaa	my mom says in her 4 th month you begin to notice <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Well, personally, I didn't feel pregnant until my second trimester.  I never had a hint of morning sickness until about half way in my fourth month.  But that isn't how you want to "feel" pregnant.  Though, my aunt said she never had morning sickness and she has two kids.  <br>  <br>  Since I was a high risk pregnancy, I had ultrasounds pretty regularly and they did one at two months.  They showed me this little circle that was the size of an english pea and said it was my baby.  So my first couple of ultrasounds didn't really make me "feel" pregnant since there weren't any distinguishable features.<br>  <br>  I had even started showing a little bit and didn't feel preggo.<br>  <br>  I think I felt pregnant when my ultrasound showed a little alien with a big head, an eye spot, and little nubs for arms and legs... but when I first felt like a mom, was when I got to hear the heartbeat.|`|PgSW7tfnaa	Well I had terrible morning sickness so that part wasn't really a great part of feeling pregnant...when I really felt pregnant was when I was 4-5 months and bought maternity clothes...which is a lot of fun cause you are showing a bit. Also yes the ultra sound where it actually looks like a cute little baby..oh is such an incredible feeling. Im such a sap I cryed. This is my first and I am due April 20th...but Im sure you will really feel prego when you are about 4-5months.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Well i started getting sick around 12weeks, but i still didn't feel pregnant. When i got my first ultrasound and seen my baby on the screen still didn't hit me that i was pregnant! Lol. it was wonderful tho.<br>  <br>  I started feeling pregnant when my belly started to pop out! & i could see her moving around in there (20wks<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I'd say I probably started feeling pregnant around week 16 because I started feeling bubs fluttering around. Before that I had little to no symptoms, so some ladies would probably feel pregnant earlier than I did.
y96eYj0Faa	Wow. That's really heartfelt. Lots of emotion poured into a few lines. Nice.|`|qRElKKjXaa	Great! : )|`|o8uGsZxmaa	That's wonderful =D<br>  <br>  You should give that to your mum|`|avpv7u8saa	Thats beautiful|`|ZQ0dRFoTaa	That is beautiful.<br>  I am truely amazed.<br>  You have talent.<br>  <3|`|JiRa3lgkaa	:D|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	Your poem does not suck.  Poetry should flow like the ebb of the tide it builds up inside the wave and comes down    some times hard other times slow.  The best time is when it flows    freely unreigned <br>             and your point     to release the pain <br>  <br>  <br>        I understand|`|PwYnVjWbaa	awhh thats so cutee(:<br>  <br>  you feel like a typical teenager i mean thats how my sister an i feel all the time. an i totally understand what you are saying(:<br>  <br>  an yes most teenagers feel that way. like more that half the people i know fee that way with their parents(:|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	OMG! ARE YOU PREGNANT!!! ;P<br>  jokes, jokes<br>  <br>  That was really good although I think the beat in "I know you have your...block in your way" was a little bit off.<br>  Apart from that, the poem's perfect!|`|8oKazGVGaa	its soooo soooo sooo nice....................................|`|uIAHkm0Naa	nice<br>  emo|`|pFmtHEv4aa	This is sooo beautiful.

I just read it again and that time it made me cry.<br>  What a powerful thing you have just written.
G9UNW0NYaa	Yes, it's fine!  It'll cause your uterus to tighten, like a contraction, but as long as it's not painful, you'll be ok.  My dr said it was ok until the day you deliver, as long as the pregnancy is going well.|`|2nqmoerIaa	yup its fine don't do it too much don't want to rush anything or even better ask a doctor <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|uQc4UA2Caa	YES OF COURSE AND IT HELP STRENGTHEN YOUR UTERINE MUSCLES|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Yes it is safe. It's best if you don't use a toys at this point in case of infection. Clitoral stimulation would be the safest. Yes it's safe.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It'll be fine, it generally doesn't cause contractions.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	yes so long as you are using somehting thats clean|`|iuMwVqnZaa	girls can masturbate?? cool!!|`|FinoWunOaa	well im 24 weeks pregnant and I still have sex and so far the baby still looks healthy so Its safe but dont stick a 10 inch dildo inside you last thing you want to do is pop your water bag|`|nyuB4POqaa	Of course sex and masterbation is fine, unless you're a high risk pregnancy, but I'm sure you and you're doctor would know that.|`|AA10979033	I would check with a dr first. You don't want to do anything to hurt that little baby.|`|coLCsrJdaa	Yes, and I like your screen name!|`|D2gkFpROaa	I dont see why not its not like the baby gonna slip out.|`|0o5L45dcaa	Go for it baby, not going to hurt and thing. just don't put anything deep inside you.|`|QOcWKbmKaa	its perfectly safe.  <br>  As long as you are not forcing air in its safe
1f2IPLB2aa	normally you would get a birth certificate for still born... depends on how many weeks etc thats all i know|`|YmEGCGtnaa	if the baby took 1 breath of a life evn for just a millisecond, yes she gets a birth certificate and sadly a death one as well. she doesnt "have' to have a funeral, it's optional and up to the parents to decide, but many in the medical field feel it helps put closure to the incident and helps the parents mourn to have a funeral bc it acknowledges their death and life. after the baby is delivered, the staff lets the parents hold look at and hold the baby and even take photos if they wish and if they want visitors to see the baby like grandparents etc then that is also allowed. they ask the parents if they want a ceremony and how they want the child to be buried. usually their health insurance plan covers these types of things, so the hospital pays for the funeral, burial, photographs, etc. the mother will be in the hospital for about the other amount of time any other woman would who had  a born alive child, it just depends on if she had a vaginal or c-section.|`|2N4j1ficaa	in uk yes she will get both a birth+death certificate ... in hospital as short as possible 3 hours  as for a funeral .. yes it helps with closer|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It depends on the country you're in. Here in Australia you do get a birth certificate although I'm pretty sure it says something along the lines of deceased on arrival. She doesn't HAVE to have a funeral, but they will certainly assist her in setting one up if she wants one. After it's delivered they will wait until she has decided what she wants to do. Sometimes they will offer the option of having an autopsy done if they aren't sure of the reason for the stillbirth. This is so that the parents can have some closure and also to offer information on what to do for subsequent pregnancies. <br>  Most hospitals will keep her in until she's showing signs of healing etc. but will require that she see a counsellor or something similar before they allow her to go home.<br>  Of course this is all information based on Australia's habits, but I would assume that many countries have a similar process.|`|UNXf7lZZaa	You do receive a birth certificate with a stillborn, but you also receive a death certificate. Its optional whether to have a funeral or not. After it is delivered, doctors ask for consent to basically examine the baby. They pretty much evaluate the child. You do not have to stay long in the hospital. There have been times where the mother delivered and left about an hour or so later. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped :]|`|I2lEkHJ9aa	it really depends on the hospitals policy. at the hospital i work at, any baby over 20 weeks has to have the remains be taken care of by the family. baby will go to the morgue after viewed by family and will be picked up my the mortuary for funeral or cremation. before that is considered products of conception and will go will all other body products to be incinerated. death certificates/pronounce of death are then filled out again for a baby over 20 weeks. the mother can usually go home the next day if she wants or can stay the regular 48 hour period. we have a grief counselor who comes in and talks with the family. usually gives them a memory box with a lock of hair, footprints, ect. and gives them info for a support group. sorry for the loss. this will be a very difficult time for your friend.
pUIGCtaZaa	You need the morning after pill...immediately! Your local pharmacy should carry it. If you are under 18, however, you need to have an adult with you to purchase it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gzwdEZcMaa	morning after pill at chemist for $30 available over the counter just ask at prescriptions section|`|IjOEpqgOaa	You can get plan B at CVS you must be 18years or older to buy. Its about 20-30 dollars.<br>  If youre not 18 bring someone that is to buy it. <br>  <br>  Buy a pregnancy test too, (you can be any age for that)|`|UePq4gqqaa	wait until your next period is due, if you miss it get a test.<br>  <br>  you can get plan B but they say to get it the next day from the pharmacy. not sure if you need an adult. i would asume so.<br>  <br>  If you just had your period wait 2-3 weeks ans take a test.|`|AA10979033	Yeah your right your a ****. And I hope God forgives you for living this way. Get a life quit running around having sex b4 being married and quit getting mad at your boyfriend and doing it with someone els. Let me know when your going to be on Jerry Springer so I can watch......|`|QOcWKbmKaa	plan B is available at planned parenthood.  Is there one near you?  Its free in most cases but could cost up to $10.
t0VJFXNSaa	Alright man, If a girl thinks she pregant she can trick her body, Im 18, And just got outta this boat, my GF was 14 days late. Talk about a bad couple weeks.<br>  <br>  But the test said no.<br>  <br>  Trust the test!<br>  And dont worry about it so much, Go drive, Shoot guns, game, something else.<br>  <br>  Its nothing. <br>  <br>  Mentality is the key here :]<br>  Girls can miss periods due to stress, and i bet being scared of that is going to stress her out too.|`|2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Don't worry.  You're not doomed, not quite.<br>  <br>  Since she is only three days late on her period, that isn't all that late.  Anything can cause a delay in a menstrual cycle, even stress over thinking she's pregnant.  <br>  <br>  If she is pregnant, she's probably still to early for a urine test to pick up.  Most of them boast the "5 days before your missed period" spiel, but that is only for people with high hormone levels.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would give it about a week to see if she gets her period.  But, if you're really worried, you can go to her doctor or a health department in your area and get a blood test done.|`|XOnpTA2Naa	only three days? anything could trigger her period to be late. stress, hormones, etc. take another test and if still in doubt see a doc. i knew i was preg when i was feeling sick all the time and couldnt eat anything. does she have signs? plus do not say you're doom. its a real miracle to actually have a baby. for two years i was trying and when i was finally preg. i lost my baby at two months. the worst day of my life, i had the baby in the toilet and the nurse on the phone said i had to bring it in. 12 hrs in the hospital and had to get surgery. after that the bill was $20,000.  im 21 years old and i have cousins 13 years old with kids.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	take her to the doctor. <br>  <br>  but if shes hella stressed about the possibility the stress might be whats making her late....|`|gBji49alaa	Have her take the plan B pill.<br>  <br>  MAybe she already took it.<br>  If she took anything to stop the "pregnancy" from developing then that's what your problem is.<br>  <br>  have her take it within 5 days.<br>  then you're straight.|`|FinoWunOaa	have her take another one in a couple more days or take her to a doctors to get blood work to find out and if she is your screwed lol not really but dont worry babys are awesome im 18 and have my 2nd on the way|`|syLCg7f3aa	Ok, if you're old enough too have sex...you are old enough to deal with the repercussions. Even with protection, pregnancy can happen.|`|BLQsD0w5aa	I'm guessing she isn't on the pill?? If she is, then I don't think you need to worry. If she isn't on the pill, you really shouldn't have had unprotected sex with her. Did you pull out? If so, there is a less chance that she could be pregnant. Just wait for about another week or so, and if her period doesn't start, have her take another test.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you two! And think about using a condom next time, k?|`|gYkQc8Lraa	SUCKED IN
iogL3GFVaa	You are probably very stressed and with the absence of your period that will just make you more stressed. Try to calm down, and don't think about it for a while(hard to do, I know). You should be fine.Just wait till you are ready for all the consequences of sex.|`|taOckxHxaa	You are probably not pregnant from what you describe, though there is at least some chance.  The pain and worry you feel is a symptom of having sex when you know you are not supposed to.  Don't put yourself through this in the future.  It is best to set boundaries, such as by not being alone with one another in order to avoid sex.  Now, a simple home pregnancy test can pretty much let you know if you are pregnant, or call 1800395help to find a pregnancy resource center.  They will give free pregnancy testing and caring support.  Take all the best care.|`|b6cuytMyaa	not to be rude or anything, but how are we supposed to know if you are pregnant?<br>  you know there is a thing called a pregnancy test.|`|rsVfcskjaa	practically the same thing happened to me and i got a test and i wasnt pregnant so i think yu'll be okay.<br>  i was really scared and stressed too|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Stressing  can make your period got into wack mode! But to me you're having the invisible period lol that's what i called it, when i had bad cramps like my period was on... but no blood.<br>  <br>  You're not pregnant! <br>  <br>  Stop stressing! :)|`|fRBZSVvIaa	It could just be your stress, I do not think you are at all. I remember my first time, I was the same way, my period was very late.|`|oQRWSt8oaa	Don't worry! They're just menstrual cramps. You either miscalculated when you're due or you're a couple days late.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	4 days? doubt it. stress makes your period late so just relax.
xgcJsAj0aa	was their any operation.......it seems like there is something wrong...u need to visit a physician.....
xue72D76aa	They tell you to wait for 6 weeks to allow your cervix and uterus to return to their original shape.  Having sex prior to that six weeks increases your risk for infection.  Just remember that you can still get pregnant after giving birth, so protect yourself unless you want to have two very closely spaced children :)|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive always been told its fine after your 6/8 week postnatal check x x|`|afDDiHbXaa	whenever you feel up to it.juat take precautions.|`|vkQOeDlUaa	depends on how you are feeling...<br>  They tell you to wait 6 weeks, but anyone rarely does.<br>  Let your body tell you when you want to have sex again.|`|BqXSymxjaa	They say to wait at least six weeks.|`|MqFeJiukaa	6 weeks|`|XoRkPaa1aa	...What? It you meant "how many months after a normal delivery can you and your husband have sex?" Unfortunately, you should wait til you stop bleeding, which is about four to six weeks after. But it is all a matter of opinion, if you want to be safe, ask your doctor if it's safe when you go in for a check up six weeks after delivering.|`|KEoChTcdaa	Months? NO WAY!!! My hubby and I had sex exactly six weeks after. And I was dieing at four!! It hurt a very little bit because the muscles were still sore. But use protection. My mother is living proof that you can get pregnant asap and on your period too. My brother and I are ten months apart. Do that math...lol|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Months? Girl.. you're crazy! <br>  <br>  Doc said its good to have sex after 6weeks. Meaning after your 6week check up and everything is fine! <br>  <br>  Then you're good to go!|`|uIAHkm0Naa	just tell him to mount you when the baby is coming out and then you can get a little D.P. going|`|vXXDzBaKaa	You are actually suppose to wait until you go back to the dr for your post pardum check up.|`|IaMByOjFaa	Well they tell you 6 weeks but if you feel up to it sooner than it your choice.|`|nyuB4POqaa	I had sex at 6 weeks|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	about 6 weeks
xue72D76aa	Let me start by saying that I understand where you are coming from completely!  I went in for a check about 3 days before my due date and I was completely closed.  My doctor (also apparently in a rush) asked me if I'd ever had my cervix frozen because he was astounded that I hadn't dilated at all.  He also said, in an offhand way, "If you're a week late, you need to consider a c-section."  I was VERY upset because I, like you, did not want an unnecessary c-section.  <br>  <br>  You are right, though.  You can go 42 weeks and be fine.  Beyond 42 weeks, the placenta starts to break down because of its age so it is dangerous to go beyond 42 weeks.  It is your right to refuse an unnecessary c-section, so if you don't want one, stand your ground.  Things can change dramatically in a short time period.  For me, I was 10 days late and arrived at the hospital (after 2 false alarms) at 6-cm, dilated the rest of the way in about an hour and had my baby.  All about 8 hours before I was to meet with the doctor again (at which time I'm *sure* he was going to push the issue again!).  <br>  <br>  Good luck and remember, you have the right to refuse a c-section!|`|vXXDzBaKaa	Of course the dr. wants you to deliver before he goes out of town because he wants the money. If there are not medical reasons why you need a c-section then you shouldn't be given one. Dr's do allow women to be pregnant for up to 42 weeks before inducing them. The baby is ready to come out though after 40 weeks the baby isn't doing anything but laying in the womb getting fat so you might have a bigger baby but he/she and you will be fine.|`|dpPqH7BAaa	It sounds like he just wants to do it before he travels. Just remember one thing. You do NOT have to do what he tells you, this is your body and your baby. You do NOT have to have a C-section, or induce before you are ready to. If he tries to make you, get a new doctor!!!!!|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Ask the doctor to refer you to another physician, should you go into labor when he is away. You shouldn't rush things just to work around his schedule.|`|qxlVHhkFaa	Your placenta gets old and not enough blood can pass through effectically and with all your baby's movements he/she could also of detached the placenta a little.

Get him to refer you to another doctor and let the baby come when he or she wants to. Its fine to go over 40 weeks, i myself was 2 weeks late, most first babies are. Dont do anything you dont want to, ask for another doctor. good luck

prqrQcd1aa	I"m going to answer this as an adult that has 3 kids and also as the oldest of 5 kids who has went through custody battles and so on.<br>  <br>  The father has all the rights that you do. Now if your child is say 3 years old and he is just now entering the child's life, you want to request that he gets to know his father first before you just send him off to stay the night with him... otherwise it will be like he is going to stay the night with a stranger. <br>  <br>  Now, all that being said, you need to file for child support if you have not all ready! I'm not saying that because he is bringing on a custody case, but because you should not have to care for the child on your own financially!|`|2N4j1ficaa	well legally he dose now  dont worry he cant take him but he shud see his child    you never no he might just turn out to be a great dad ? and its more than likely the Cort's will grant him access any way|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Specific rights on a specific situation in a specific state can be something people on here may not be able to really know.<br>  <br>  In general, your son's father has "parental" rights (if he hasn't relinquished those or permanently lost them as a result of being an abuser or someone who abandoned the child for x number of months/years.<br>  <br>  Generally, parental rights means he has a right to see the child, to not have you try to keep them apart, and to have a say about something placing a child for adoption.<br>  <br>  What other rights he has depends on whether there is a court-ordered custody arrangement or not.   Even then, court-ordered custody arrangements vary.  There is "physical" custody and "joint" custody, and then there are matters of things like a right to talk to the child's doctor or teachers, etc.  "Sole" custody generally means the person who doesn't have custody has no rights to decisions about schools and things like that.<br>  <br>  If there is no court-ordered custody arrangement he has a right to ask for one.  That doesn't necessarily mean he can get custody of your child (although he could under some circumstances); but he does have a right to ask for a court order that will specify exactly when he gets to see the child, what voice he has in decision-making, etc.<br>  <br>  He does have a right to file for custody, but that doesn't mean he would win by any means.  Then again, under certain circumstances or if certain lies get told about you, he may stand a chance of it.<br>  <br>  Usually, too, with parental rights comes parental responsibility (which means the expectation of child support).<br>  <br>  If he disappeared for long enough and never kept in touch, then there could be the abandonment issue.  I believe, though, that before a person loses all parental rights because of abandonment, there has to be attempts by the court to contact/notify him x number of times for x long, and after he doesn't respond that's when the matter of abandonment may come into play.|`|S2h30aZwaa	Well, he's right and wrong at the same time.  As the "father" of the child he does have the same "rights" as you.  He does have the right of visitation, whether or not he is paying child support.  Depending on the state you live in, will depend on the way "fatherhood" is established (i.e. DNA or birth certificate).  Most states lean more towards the mother as custodial parent, that is starting to change.  Your best bet is to go to a family attorney and preemptive strike, before he tries for custody. If you can't afford an attorney, speak to a SRS worker and they may be able to assist in that matter.  Also some cities and states have law hotlines and they will point you in the direction of an affordable attorney.  Bottom line is, if he is the father he does have rights and you can't keep him from the child.  I would get a notebook and document everything, calls you make to attorney, calls and meetings you have with him, and a brief summary of what was said.  The more documentation you have the better.  I would avoid contact with him and let the courts settle this.  Remember, you will have to deal with him for a very long time.  Try and keep it as civil, even professional, as you possibly can.  Don't lose your temper, that will NOT work in your favor,  Keep in mind that you need to do what is best for you son, not what is best for you.  GOOD LUCK!  I'm rooting for you.|`|LLbOdAqjaa	Oh custody battle.<br>  <br>  Umm well he is the boys father, if you do go to court eventually there will probably be a DNA test to prove that.<br>  <br>  And if he does get some custody he will have to pay child support.<br>  <br>  But then again since you two never got married I am very unsure<br>  <br>  <br>  I would definitely do some deep internet research on this,.. because each state is different etc.|`|AA11024148	if his name is on the birth certificate then he has every right you do.<br>  <br>  go to the courthouse right now and get custody of your child.<br>  i know in a commonwealth state (which is where i live) you don't actually have custody untill you go get it. it's one of those laws that don't normally get much attention, but if a lawyer is brought in, it (custody papers) will be used.|`|OTFZtGCaaa	It might be different from state to state, but in California the father has the same rights as you do and (unfortunately) in certain states it is not uncommon that a judge grants fathers overnights even for newborns, regardless whether you’re breastfeeding or not (very sad, but true).<br>  <br>  Your best approach is to always keep the well-being of your child in mind.  There are unfortunately many men that don’t want to have anything to do with their child.  If you thoroughly think about your situation, you (or more your son) are actually one of the lucky ones where the father wants to be actively involved in your son’s life.  <br>  <br>  In most cases, the initial stage between the parents is difficult as there are still many emotions and issues unresolved.  However, you’ll make everyone’s life MUCH easier if you tell him that you are glad about his desire wanting to be actively involved in your son’s life.  (Hopefully) He’ll appreciate your approach and he won’t get all worked up thinking he’ll have to fight you over visitation with his son.<br>  <br>  Most likely you’ll get much farther with this approach, and if you’re able to work out an agreement either directly with him or through mediation, everyone wins (well, maybe not the lawyers).  If you take it to court, you never know the outcome and you might get a big surprise if he gets a much bigger share than you would ever have dreamed possible.  If your approach is supportive of his involvement, his visitation request might be surprisingly reasonable.<br>  <br>  I don’t know how old your son is, but it sounds like he’s within his first year.  Because he’s so young, I would advise you to do a trial period before you put a schedule on paper.  My (at that time 5 months old baby) baby’s father initially insisted in overnights but he came quickly to the realization that it’s not good for our daughter.  We’re now doing one hour lunch visits twice throughout the week and 4 hours every Sat & Sun (which is a pain in the behind for both us parents as we’re talking about 1 hour driving, but it’s the best solution for our daughter at this time), with the attempt to increase the hours and only do one of the weekend-days when she’s older and ready for it, and much later to every other weekend in addition to certain times throughout the week – all depending on our daughter’s needs and what’s in her best interest.  If your son’s father is a reasonable parent he’ll recognize if your son misses you and will work with you to make adjustments to shorter visits in case you started out with visitations that are too long.  As long as he feels he is not excluded, things might be fine.<br>  <br>  As far as the child support is concerned, let your local government agency handle that.  They do all the work for you for free;  both parties have to provide income calculation and then they do a simple calculation of income and time share with the child, and some expenses considered.  Once that’s all done, there can be automatic payments, which means you’ll never have to ask him for money directly as the agency will take it from him and send it to you (provided he’s a W2 employee); also convenient for him.  It keeps unnecessary stress away and allows you to concentrate on what’s really important – your son.<br>  <br>  The fact that fathers have the same rights might be tough to digest at first, however, think about how often we women criticize men that are not involved in their children’s life and how we look down upon these type of men … and when they do want to be involved, we don’t like it either … it’s hypocritical. <br>  <br>  It might also help to think about it from your son’s perspective.  I’m sure you’re a good mother and you want what’s best for your son.  Think about how your son would feel if your situation was different and the father wouldn’t want to have anything to do with him.  He would be heartbroken and it would leave emotional scars for the rest of his life, longing for his father.  He needs his father in his life as much as he needs you.  Despite (I assume) bad feelings between the two of you, I’m sure there are lots of things he’ll be able to teach your son which will enrich your son’s life.  Last but not least, I’m sure there must be some good things about him if you dated him for more than a year.  ;o)
S2h30aZwaa	Sore breasts was a common thing for me as well.  However, with my first pregnancy, during the week I was supposed to have my period my breasts were incredibly sore.  As in more than just tender, they hurt constantly and felt really heavy and full.  I had quit looking at the calendar and actively "trying" and had put the thought out of my mind, very hard believe me.  So, it came as a surprise and shock to find out I was finally pregnant.  Good Luck!

2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	It depends.  <br>  <br>  I never had regular periods either, so someone telling you to wait till you miss a period might be giving you MONTHS to wait.  Break through bleeding is pretty common in early pregnancy from what my OB told me.  I had a light, spotty period my first month and I thought I wasn't because of it.<br>  <br>  Home pregnancy tests are pretty sketchy.  There are some that say they can tell 5 days before your missed period, but that takes quite a person to pull it off.  If you want to go that method though, you'd probably want to give it 3-6 weeks and get a kit that has multiple tests.  I went through 5 tests before I got my "faint line" and it was a couple of more days before it was an obvious line.<br>  <br>  The quickest and most conclusive way would be to go to a doctor or your local health department and have a blood test done.  Even with that, I'd still give it a week after to see.  <br>  <br>  Remember, there is a bunch of stuff that can go wrong this early on.  The zygote doesn't attach properly, not enough hCG, etc.  Since it is pretty obvious you're trying (with you stating you were checking your ovulation) you might want to wait longer before you decide to find out.<br>  <br>  Whenever I was trying, I found did the blood tests and "lost" two in the very early stages.  The OB said technically they weren't lost, but didn't take.  Contrary to some belief, getting pregnant isn't really the problem but staying pregnant is.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	You can't tell until you miss a period. That is the main symptom of pregnancy. Period symptoms and pregnancy symptoms are very similar so the only way you can really know is if you miss a period. You can test the day after your missed period to see if you are pregnant. Don't listen to the people that say 'most chicks say they can tell just days after' coz that is bullshit. U can't tell a few days after ovulating. It takes 2-3 days for the egg alone to be fertilized after ovulation. Im sorry to say its just a waiting game so see if you get a period or not.<br>  Good luck|`|cIn8BkYHaa	Usually 2 weeks later a test should come back positive or negative. Although if ovulation was late it could possibly be 3 weeks, it's usually better to retest to be sure.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	2 minutes|`|Du8QhOmaaa	I would wait 3 weeks and then take the test.|`|nyuB4POqaa	3 weeks|`|tO8fDsxhaa	The over the counter tests say a week.

AA10487097	When you start PMSing|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Well, that's impossible to know unless you were charting. If you have a regular 28 day cycle, then you should get your next period around the 27th of this month. If you have a shorter or longer cycle, then obviously that date's gonna be wrong. Not everyone has a perfect 28 day cycle.<br>  <br>  In future, calculate your cycles. Day one is the first day of your period and you count to the first day of the next period (and also count that as day one to start calculating your next cycle). After about 3 months of doing this, you should have a fairly accurate idea of when you're periods are due every month.<br>  <br>  Some months I have heavier or lighter periods than normal... but if you suspect you're pregnant you should do a test. Sometimes very light bleeding can be confused for a light period, when indeed it's implantation bleeding.|`|xjXxs92caa	Only you know that.geez.|`|0Jxkioh2aa	count 28 days from the day of when your last one started, and it should be within a few days of that. some cycles are a bit different though and that may not work for you but it's worth a try. soo you should have one on the 27th of february|`|jeDExMWBaa	go to the store and spend $10 on a pregnancy test!

This can increase the risk of the condom breaking,  To stop this from happening use some lubricant like KY jelly either on his penis or around your vjj.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to be having sex regularly, get a script for the pill in preparation for you next period.  I think you start taking it on your first day of bleeding.  Still use a condom if you really don't want to get pregnant, and just in case of STD's.<br>  <br>  Have fun!  Be safe!|`|xsvDrtrRaa	best thing for you to know if you are pregnant is to have  a pregnanc test we cant say if your pregnant or not sometimes we feel like we are but actually were not things will be clear if you will get your car working and go to the nearest store where you can  buy a P.T|`|jeDExMWBaa	$10 for a test box at CVS!

Bhy4k9wPaa	What is Sukhi?!?<br>  <br>  Common contraceptives-the pill, coil, implant and a condom.<br>  Less common-injection and patch.<br>  <br>  Trying to think of others...|`|AA12156890	* Hormonal methods include birth control pills, shots (Depo-Provera), the skin patch, the implant, and the vaginal ring. Birth control that uses hormones is very good at preventing pregnancy.<br>      * Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are inserted into your uterus. IUDs work very well for 5 to 10 years at a time and are very safe. And the Mirena IUD contains a hormone that can help with heavy periods and cramping.<br>      * Barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, and sponges. In general, these do not prevent pregnancy as well as IUDs or hormonal methods do. To help a barrier work better, use it with a spermicide, a chemical that kills sperm.<br>      * Natural family planning (also called fertility awareness) can work if you and your partner are very careful. You will need to keep good records so you know when you are fertile. And during times when you are fertile, you will need to skip sex or use a barrier method.<br>      * Permanent birth control (sterilization) gives you lasting protection against pregnancy. A man can have a vasectomy, or a woman can have her tubes tied (tubal ligation). But this is only a good choice if you are sure that you don't want any (or any more) children.|`|80fWQyDnaa	It has side effects . Why not use condoms ? This is safest .

2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Actually, home tests aren't all that accurate during early stages of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Not trying to say anything, but I've never even heard of PregTest and while it isn't always a sign of quality, but generally more popular/expensive brands are better at detecting hCG sooner.<br>  <br>  Normally the best time to take the test is in the morning.  Your hCG levels are higher then but depending on how far along you are, they could still be wrong.  Most home kits don't register till your 3-5 weeks along.<br>  <br>  I actually had breakthrough bleeding my first month of pregnancy, and was 6 weeks with 5 negative home tests before I even got my first "faint line".  Finally, my doctor did a blood test at my regular appointment and that was how I knew for sure.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	very reliable but may be your HCG are low so test again in a week time if your period dont come best of luck......|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	The home test if reliable. Your apprehension may not be correct.|`|OUbgs89taa	Most the time, the test is correct... having said that... i have a friend that was prgnant and the home tests all came back neg. <br>  <br>  You should try using the first urine of the morning esp if you are very early pregnant and see a doctor for a blood test if you are unsure.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	its quite reliable but can make mistakes|`|nyuB4POqaa	No I doubt it<br>  You're probably not pregnant
jaAolejUaa	it is advised to but not a must|`|gx4s68s8aa	You don't have to sleep on your left side.  However, the left side does provide for a little more circulation to the baby.  Many woman sleep on their backs or on their right side and it is just fine.  You might want to ask your doctor about this at your next appointment.  Because if you have certain medical problems etc. then your doctor very well might prefer you to sleep on your left side.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I don't think...|`|ygimTNzoaa	No, I'm 20 weeks along. I mostly sleep on my right side because my man is on the left side of the bed he says he loves to turn and hold me. So I prefer the right side. Getting further along in the pregnancy near the end I hear it's not good to lay on your back for more then 5 mins because of the pressure on all you're intestines and spine. You should lay on your side or your stomach only when past 35 weeks is what I hear.|`|MkCTwE95aa	It is true that sleeping on your left side is better for blood circulation to your baby and the rest of your body. Especially as you get bigger the more helpful it is to sleep on your left side. I have had an issue with vericose veins in my pregnancy and my midwife said sleeping on my left side might help with that which could be true because some mornings i wake up and they are barely there and other mornings i wake up and it is scary! lol      Lying on your back wont hurt the baby but it will slow blood flow a little and that is only for prolonged periods of time, its ok to lie on your back when your doctor is checking your fundus and all that. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night on my back but just turn back over to the left side.     The right side has the same issue as lying on your back, the vein that your uterus can press on to slow blood flow is a little more to the right.  But many women sleep in all sorts of positions and their babies are fine, its just another one of those helpful hints to do as best you can.|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	No, it's simply the recommended side for the best blood flow.   There are two large arteries in the back area. If you are pregnant, then both of these arteries can get pinched by the weight of the pregnant belly if you lie on your back.   If you lie on your side, only one of these arteries may get pinched. The smaller of the two is on the right side, so if you lie on that, the bigger one would flow more blood in the body.   If you lie on your left side and pinch the larger artery, it's still okay since the other artery is flowing good.   When I was pregnant, I had a water bed which gave me a third option of sleeping on my stomach, since the mattress made room for my belly. Both of my back arteries flowed fine.|`|joPJtKemaa	Absolutely not!!!!!!!!|`|yPNvecc7aa	I keep reading this too.   I'm 26 weeks and my doctor has not told me to sleep a certain way. If it was such a huge deal, I'm sure she wouldn't have let me walk out of her office without knowing this crucial information. Plus, every time she checks me or the baby, she makes me lie back flat.  Maybe it will come later.  At the moment, I am still sleeping comfortably on my back and either side. (Not on my stomach obviously.)|`|cypZ0ykXaa	its better  to sleep on your left side. Sleeping on your left side will increase the amount of blood and nutrients that reach the placenta and your baby. Keep your legs and knees bent and a pillow between your legs. just avoid Sleeping on your back & Sleeping on your stomach. but, i prefer on both left & right sides."good luck"|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The left side is better for the baby, but it is perfectly fine to alternate between your left and right sides.  Just try to stay off your back and stomach.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i was told u cant lay on your back i was also told you cant put ur hands above your head.i sleep however i can get comfy. most of the time i end up switching positions every half hour anyways|`|8WRnqs08aa	You can sleep on your left or right side or your back if comfortable. The reason they say to sleep on your left side is because if you sleep on your right or your back, it could cut off oxygen to the baby, especially the further along you get in to your pregnancy. I try to prop pillows around me and I am more comfortable on my left side versus my right or on my back.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Sleep however you can. Your body will let you know if you need to change positions.     Don't get caught up in the left side only/don't sleep on your back hype. I'm 38 weeks and sleep in the least painful position, which more often than not is on my back.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	When you are farther along it is best to sleep on your left side (not your back, that will become horribly uncomfortable and could compress major blood vessels) because it will put less stress on your organs and vascular system than sleeping on your right side.  Early in pregnancy it's fine to sleep in other positions, but as your belly grows these will become very uncomfortable or even impossible.|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	Your vena cava is on your right side. Laying off of it helps keep blood pressure and swelling down, but you can lay on it no problem.|`|l10h4yqeaa	That is untrue. You can sleep on either side but should never sleep on your back because it can block a major vein. They say sleeping on your left side does help if you get heartburn. But either side is ok.

VhE4KWhOaa	He needs to know its wrong. swat him the next time he does something or if ur against spanking or whatever put him in the corner tell him we don't push or hit and we don't give gracey little things explain to him. he's old enough to know right from wrong but he still doesn't know about the rights and wrongs dealing with a baby. he needs to be punished and he will realize that "hey i shouldn't do things like that or i get in trouble."  he may cry and scream if u do punish him but make sure u go through with the punishment|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	One thing that comes to mind is a game to teach him about giving nice touches to his sister. It was on a supernanny or nanny 911 or something. Get a lot of soft, comfy objects. Have him close his eyes and rub his arm with the objects and talk about how it feels. About the pennies in the mouth.... hmmm That's tough|`|hieQHR0daa	He needs to know that this is wrong. Take him aside and ask him how he would feel if you threw a big heavy book at him?  Part of his problem may be that at five he still has a limited vocabulary and cannot always express what he is feeling and thinking. Using drawings and dolls to communicate can work well for some children. If he persists with this then he really needs expert help.
MDTgUDnUaa	It may be a vitamin deficiency caused by the pregnancy. Have you talked to your OB and regular doc? It is true that hair-loss is more common after having the baby. I'd check with your doc and see if there is something they can give you to help.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	the less i shampoo my hair,the more that seems to fall out when i do. its ok to lose 100-150 hairs a day. this is something you should ask your dr|`|joPJtKemaa	Are you taking your prenatal vitamins religiously?

j3YRIJafaa	nope this is not weird at all, you are just obeying them and this is good, with this you will learn self control and all the good factors that will reward you with success in life, you have a good structure in your life and be proud of that and especially yourself with how you are dealing with this and i am sure your parents are proud of you because you are not throwing it back in there faces! just keep it up and you will do well - hope this helps|`|prqrQcd1aa	No, it's not weird at all, many people thrive on structure... In fact yes, in many ways they are "training" you!|`|uly3aFqtaa	How old are you? [Just wondering].<br>  <br>  Well as far as I know, most kids get rather sick of being 'bossed around' by their Parents by some stage.<br>  <br>  Maybe you've just been brought up very well, but perhaps this 'structure' isn't allowing you to learn independence - it seems like you are very used to your Parents being the ones that control your life, but you need to understand that you can control your life to a certain extent.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	i was a very good kid. i never drank never did drugs never went to parties. i was good made good grades but i was mouthy as all get out. i get along pefect with my parents...even though they say im a b***h but thats all gravy. youre doing things rght kid done change a thing...btw im only 20! just trust me on this one.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	No, you're just being obedient. You cause more problems not listening to them. However, there comes a time when you will have to go against their word sometimes. Just make sure that your reason justifies your actions.|`|zLUk9YyCaa	No not at all. Your parents musta been very good at raising you if you don't put up any resistance.<br>  <br>  (this comes from someone whose still being raised so I guess you kinda have advice from your perspective =)  )|`|KvmjaU86aa	Parents been training their kids since day one because it's they're job.|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	This sounds like normal parenting, but it can be bad for you if they over-do it... <br>  <br>  You run the risk of developing an overly submissive personality as an adult. This is called the "nice guy syndrome". You'll end up being very well-mannered and well-behaved, but this instilled behavior to do whatever it takes to be a "good boy" will interfere with your wants, needs, and desires in life. You'll end up doing whatever it takes to please and accommodate the needs of others whilst ignoring your own needs.<br>  <br>  Structure is fine, but you also need to be comfortable with being in control of your own life. Playing it safe and staying within the lines has it's negatives, so be careful. Don't be afraid to stick up for your feelings, wants, needs, and desires. Don't be afraid to stand up to your parents if you feel your feelings, wants, needs, and desires are being oppressed or going without concern.<br>  <br>  If you have the chance, read the book "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Robert Glover. It offers fantastic insight into this phenomenon.|`|idgJndmBaa	Wait. I'm confused. So confused! Aren't you the guy who wrote all these questions earlier about being grounded for a really long time and having a 9pm bedtime and how if you complained it would be pushed up to 8 and that you think they are harsh? I could have sworn that was you. <br>  I don't get it. Why are you saying you like the structure now, but a few hours ago you seemed to resent it?<br>  <br>  And if you're a teenager old enough to have a Yahoo account you're too old to be spanked or have a 9pm curfew. That's not preparing you to be an adult at all cause it's too harsh and regimented.|`|34VfDyuyaa	it is not weird.<br>  it is good, very good.<br>  you will grow into a very disciplined human.<br>  chances for success are higher for people who are disciplined.<br>  <br>  if you like the structure, then you know it's good for you. whether consciously or subconsciously, you acknowledge the discipline as a benefit in the future.<br>  <br>  um, although spanking might be a little too cruel?|`|rhDnaro5aa	I dont think its wierd to get along with your parents.I say if it works for you, then why change it.
hVVALFAPaa	Babies sometimes get irritable right before a growth spurt. At about 12 weeks, she should be due for a growth spurt. You may find that she will be eating more often,  and being irritable, then go through a period of lots of sleeping.    The growth spurts usually happen at 8 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months.    They can also get irritable sleep patterns when they are learning a new skill, like rolling over, crawling, standing, walking. They 'work' through it in their sleep, just the way we sometimes dream about and work through our own problems.     You may try starting her out in your bed but put her in a bassinet after her first nighttime feeding. She may just need a bit more room to work things out.    Good luck!|`|yCwPxulYaa	I co-sleep with my daughter often (not every night, but often) and she does move ALOT in her sleep. What I have started doing, is putting something between us. Last night she feel asleep in our bed so I let her stay, and I just rolled up a receiving blanket and laid it between us so she would not kick me/punch me/pinch me/ while she was sleeping.  If she starts moving to much, usually all it takes for us is a couple of pats on the bottom and she drifts back to sleep. This morning, I woke up to her sucking on the tip of my nose thinking that it was her breakfast  We have interesting nights sometimes but I have found that if I give her enough room to flail around while she is sleeping, we all sleep better.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	My baby is 7 weeks old and sleeps with me.  Sometimes she will make noise in her sleep. Lots of time when she starts to kick and turn her head a lot in her sleep it means she will be getting up soon.  My daughter is also sleeping 4 to 5 hours only getting up to have a quick snack then fall right back to sleep.     The kicking and moving is normal.  If its getting really bad and you can't sleep try putting a crib or bassinet in your room by the bed so you can still be close but not get kicked.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You need a side car!    You can get a fancy specially made co-sleeping sidecar but they don't work that well OR you can take your crib and use it as a side car.      Or you may, and I know this sucks, but you may need to have her sleep on your chest for awhile.  BTDT.    Now the *theory* is that the baby sleeps in the side car and has all the space they need but can also be right next to you and nurse.  In reality I have spent a lot of nights in the side car, but hey at least there was room somewhere in bed for me!    There's a whole long explanation I used to give for using a crib as a side car but in a nutshell.  Take the drop side off the crib.  Have the mattresses level.  Make sure that the bed frame and crib frame can't move away from each other, make sure the crib mattress and bed mattress can't move away from each other.  Roll up a couple of sheets or use very firm foam to make a gap filler to fill the gap created by having one side missing from the crib.  This should be about the height of the crib mattress and not fluffy.  Put it on the far side of the crib mattress near the bars.  Its helpful to make a pad that goes over the crib mattress and under you to help with the transition between the two mattresses, something not fluffy (those old style quilted vinyl backed table cloths are awesome).  Also its more comfortable if your crib mattress doesn't have the anti-crush sides.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Put her in her own bed. It is too dangerous for her to be co sleeping with you. Maybe that is why she is fitting during the night. The sooner you do this the better so she can learn to sleep on her own or you'll have her in your bed for a long time. Not only will she start sleeping better but so will you. And you'll have more energy to play with her during the day.

XOnSRoR2aa	: )<br>  <br>  Yes, I have. That quote is one of my absolute favorites, and the sentiment dwells within me. There have many times when my breath has been taken away and my heart has started to thunder and I feel like I'm going to cry simply because what I'm looking at is so overwhelmingly beautiful I almost can't take it all in. I get mad, I get annoyed, and hurt, and stung, but holding onto it all is like carrying around a hot coal that will distract you from noticing the beauty and good in life. I've been extraordinarily fortunate to travel to many countries around the globe at a very young age (17), and to see the natural wonder and beauty of the world, and more importantly of the human spirit. You don't need a passport to witness this, though, because it's all around us if only we're willing to notice. Soak up all the splendor, let the rain refine you, and always, always look out for the best and the most beautiful in the small and the simple as well as in the grand, and in everything and everyone, and never take anything for granted.

It still brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. And it deserves those tears. Sometime, when you're alone, when you've got some money, between august 10th and September 25th, Drive north From Newport all the way up to Astoria, Oregon, non-stop. Start at about 10 in the morning and you'll see what I mean. And you will be caught up in the beauty, And it will fill your heart up like a baloon, I just hope it doesn't burst, because this is by far (at least 10 times) more beautiful than any other place I have ever seen in the United States (I did come through Nevade and See Wecome  Mountain from the west with a full moon over it one time, that was pretty crushing as well). But YES, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AT, AND YES, I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT. Don't forget what I said about the North Oregon Coast, and I put the dates in there so you can avoid the rain.

AA12254690	For a boy to be Junior is soooooo "played out" for lack of a better word. So many people do this I feel like soon every single boy in school will be a Junior. Yes, it is nice to have a name sake however it is not original and well done too much.

It is so American cliche. I also think it's a little stuck up to call your child after yourself, a grand parent or someone special makes sense but why would you want 2 people in the same family to have the same name?

Tacky!|`|W7l1awFPaa	Why would I want to?  It is not like a child would be a clone of me.  Plus think of all the confusion if someone was calling your name and both of you were answering?

382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	I have had my 3 kids christened in Victoria. Yes, you can still have your baby christened even though you have never been.<br>  It is up to you how much you want to pay the priest to perform the christening. There is no set fee, you just give the priest a donation. We gave him $50 each time to christen our sons. <br>  To organise it, simply ring the priest and speak to him. Basically all you have to do is choose what date best suits you, and give him your babies details. Then turn up on the day! Our priest holds the Christenings during the mass service, but many hold them seperately.<br>  Lots of luck with the new addition!
CPwdVc4caa	I know how you must feel; I lost my first baby last June at 19 weeks, only a couple days before my gender scan was scheduled.  It gets easier to accept with time, but you never forget the baby that could have been.  Let yourself grieve, and don't be afraid to lean on your family and significant other.  Someday we'll know why these things had to happen.<br>  <br>  As for the bleeding, if it's any heavier than a pad an hour, you need to get to the ER.  You could need a D&C to get rid of any tissue still left.  Otherwise you can expect bleeding for another 10 days or so.|`|AA12254690	I never had a miscarriage but i would like to send my condolences out to you. I'm sure you will eventually feel better.

Nature can be very cruel or kind depending upon your point of view. Sometimes it aborts a baby because it has a defect which would make it's life unbearable and this may be the case here, and to this extent it may be a blessing in disguise. No one is at fault,no one has done anything wrong it is just the way it is. I wish you well.    I really do.

I was never able to hold the baby comforatably, and I know my kids were not that comforatable me having to really work hard to get them and me in a comfy way. <br>  I too felt the pressure of not purely breastfeeding. It is your right as it was mine, to do what works for us. If you want the benefits of breast milk and the convience of bottles, try pumping the milk and bottle feed it if your making enoug to make it worth the extra effort maybe?<br>  The first months are so draining, no sleep, trying to recover from birth, do what is also healthy for you too hun. Dont worry about others, you and baby will be fine. I already warned my daughter that she may or may not want to breastfeed and that if she starts stressing out (shes got adhd really bad and gets really emotional) to try to pump and bottle feed. My daughter is having her baby as I type, sorry for going on so long, I cant be there, Im nervous.|`|20jl3ReDaa	My son is 2 now but when he was a newborn he had a lot of difficulty with breastfeeding. So I know it feels like your on your own but you're not i promise!<br>  In the end (after lots of pushing and complaining to the doctor by me!) we worked out that my son had a 'tongue-tie' basically the bit that attaches your tongue to the bottom of your mouth was too far forward on him which meant it was difficult for him to latch on properly and suck. Eventually he broke it himself (which is common) but that was after him losing a lot of weight and me being VERY stressed!<br>  <br>  Have you tried a nipple sheild with the bit that makes your nipple pull out more? Like this: <a href="http://www.motheringfromtheheart.com/275%20Nipple%20Protector.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.motheringfromtheheart.com/275...</a>  i found this helped a lot.<br>  <br>  Other than that try expressing some milk and giving her that in a bottle before she has too much formula, I do think its best for babies to have breastmilk but please don't get too stressed about it, you have enough to worry about!<br>  <br>  Speak to your midwife/health visitor about it, i ended up having to do half and half (formula, breastmilk) because my son was too hungry and i didnt have enough milk.<br>  <br>  As long as you try, you have nothing to feel guilty about!|`|RdprMxoUaa	She could be teething. My son went through the same thing at around the same time, Maybe a few weeks older. I know it sounds way too early for teeth but it happened to him. My son would start to suck the breast and then pull of and cry. It was just too painful for him. For some reason a bottle was ok though. Try expressing your milk with and electric pump (manual is too hard if you are doing it for an extended period of time) and give it to her in a bottle. That way she is feeding and you don't have to stress about the pressure of not breast feeding. Once her mouth feels better she will probably be willing to try feeding directly from you again. Hope this helps.|`|byM2zxPAaa	look i see it this way.... more importantly it is how you and baby are, people can think what they want to... but if your bub is happier when she has had a formula feed, maybe that is the way to go.. it sounds like it to me.<br>  happy baby means happy mumma.<br>  I tried breast feeding for 3 weeks with complete failure (due to birth trauma my brain would not do it)... my baby was upset and so distressed from being very hungry that i just gave in and gave her formula... she's 9 months old now, has never been sick and sleeps 14 hours a night... now that is a satisfied baby...<br>  <br>  i hope i helped... i know exactly how you feel|`|jS6Qkj0faa	it could be colic. for her it means a belly ache. there is some research saying removing dairy products from the mother's diet has had good effect. either that or it could be something else in your diet such as too much caffeine, tomato, pineapple etc. It must be heartbreaking and frustrating having a little one who you love so much but cant soothe. Nipple shields are only any good if you have introverted nipples and need something for baby to attatch to initially. If your boobs are big and full of milk its a good idea to express a bit first to soften the area so bubby can attatch properly. Colic usually resolves itself around 6 weeks of age but its a harrowing time for parents until then.<br>  Breast milk is best for baby- it has everything they need and protects them against bugs/ germs. the reason ppl are so pro breastfeeding is that it IS better for the child and no formula will ever hope to copy it. I understand how you feel though - went through that with my first son.<br>  Try and get some rest while baby is resting and look after yourself too. have a nap when bubs is napping and make sure you stay hydrated and make sure you eat as well. its easy to get wrapped up in looking after a newborn and forget about yourself. can hubby/ grandma/ neighbour take bubby for cuddles while you have a bath or something nice for yourself? <br>  try talking to a lactation consultant (often they are available through baby/child health centres) or ringing the la leche/ breastfeeding association in your area as they are a mine of useful information as well.<br>  good luck.
jw1bNJMCaa	The man on top.Yup, it's that simple. This is the best and most natural position to get pregnant! Given its simplicity, this 'secret' is almost a no-brainer! Yet, very often, the simplest and most natural way is usually 'The Way', or 'The Position'. In fact, this common position among couples is one that is favored by doctors helping those with difficulty conceiving.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its too EARLY to teach her to fall asleep by herself.    And even feber and other advocates of CIO say not to do it until baby is 6 months old!    http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/comf...  Am I creating a bad habit by allowing baby to nurse to sleep?    Your baby's desire to nurse to sleep is very normal and not a bad habit you've fostered. Don't be afraid to nurse your baby to sleep or fear that you are perpetuating a bad habit. Baby often will seek the breast when sleepy or over-stimulated because it's a comforting and familiar place to him. To associate the breast with wanting to relax enough to go to sleep makes perfect sense. As adults, we also do things to relax ourselves so we can go to sleep: we read, watch TV, get something warm to drink or a snack, deep breathe, get all snug under the covers, etc. Nursing does the same thing for your baby.    For many babies at the height of exploration or distractibility, nighttime or naptime can often be the ONLY time the baby will nurse well. Allowing him to nurse at these times when he is more focused on nursing and less intent on other things helps ensures that he gets enough milk, that your supply is maintained, and that the nursing relationship goes on. Don't be afraid to nurse at these times or fear that you are perpetuating a bad habit. Instead, take advantage of these times for better nursing.    The sleep issue is not merely a matter of good versus bad habits. It is much more an issue of culture and lifestyle and expectations. Here are three approaches to parenting issues:        * Forcing baby to change to fit the parent's lifestyle is one approach. Our American culture tends not to be very baby friendly, and rarely makes accommodations for nursing babies. The current trend, seen in many popular books and parenting magazines, is to force baby to do all of the accommodating so that we experience as little change in our pre-baby lifestyle as possible; for example, baby MUST sleep through the night so that we get unbroken sleep and a "good" baby is seen as one who makes as few demands on his parents as possible.      * Another approach is to try to approximate the mothering style of traditional societies and let the parents do all the accommodating. This approach can be very difficult to pull off without lots of support and changes of expectations in the people around us.      * A third approach is to do as much accommodating on the parental side as possible, and then to "ask" baby to accommodate the last part of the gap. This is an approach that can work for many families. With this approach, parents do all they can to be sensitive to their baby's needs, and only ask baby to accommodate when nothing else truly works.     http://www.naturalchild.org/tine_theveni...  For some strange reason we tend to think that to satisfy a child's need is to make it into an unbreakable habit, where in truth the exact opposite is true.6    When our children develop a "good" habit, one that suits us, we are afraid it is not going to last. But when our children develop a "bad" habit, one that does not suit us, we are afraid it is going to last forever. So many people are afraid that their children will not grow up. We are told to feed them solids with a spoon at three weeks of age, lest babies will never learn to eat solids, let alone with a spoon. We are told to toilet train them when they are one year old or they will never quit wearing diapers. We are told to begin to discipline them at one month, otherwise they will never listen to us. We are told that children must always sleep in their own bed or they will always want to sleep with us. It is commonly believed that babies need to be weaned by the mother. And yet when weaning is left totally up to the child, it happens in a natural, healthy, and relaxed way. At the time the child no longer needs direct physical contact with his mother, then he weans himself from the breast. Likewise, parents' experiences indicate that the healthy child will wean himself in time from the parental bed.    Children should be given the credit that, provided the home environment is healthy, they will mature. As each need is fulfilled at each stage, they will move on and become more mature. (We did. Let's hope.)    http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...  Normal babies sleep during the day and are up at night, at least for the first several (6-8) weeks. That is normal and expected and nothing we can do to change that. That means that parents need to sleep when the baby is sleeping to avoid all the great things that go along with sleep deprivation. Older infants get up at night, but less often, and it is normal for one year olds to not be sleeping through the night. Of course, if I did my job earlier, you now understand that nobody sleeps through the night. Interesting tidbit: about 80% of parents of one year olds identify their children as having "sleep problems." Eighty percent? Maybe we have an expectatio|`|zcYl3ftTaa	It is too early for the cry it out method.  Also, letting you baby cry for two hours until she falls asleep from being exhausted is not the cry-it-out method.  It is not too late to have your baby self soothe. She will learn it on her own. Try patting her back or butt when she wakes up from being put down. You don't have to leave her cry, and you also don't have to pick her back up.  There is nothing wrong with rocking your baby to sleep. It is part of your job as a parent.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	You cannot "teach" a baby to fall asleep by themselves and letting her CIO it out for 2 hours is neglect IMO.  Even advocates of CIO do not endorse just letting them cry for hours on end, they also do not recommend any earlier than 6 months.

I still remember it viscerally and emotionally.  It's a black hole inside of me that never goes away.  Why do you have to torture a 12 week old?  What is her crime?  That she's an infant and has infant needs?  Don't let her cry it out.  You can see and hear that she's suffering.  What's the point?  She is not capable of manipulation.  An infant under 12 months just NEEDS.  Do you want to teach her to give up on having her needs met at the age of 3 months?  She's a baby for a short time and her emotional experience now will determine her sense of feeling at home or not feeling at home in this world for the rest of her life.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	You let your 12 week old baby cry for 2 hours??? That is horrible...even people who believe in this method don't believe it should be started until 6 months and you are suppose to only let them cry for a short time...not 2hrs......pick up your baby and don't let her cry like that...My baby is 14 months old and I still rock and breastfeed her to sleep...they will eventually learn to fall asleep on their own when they are ready...they are only little for a short period...|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	She can be taught but once we start something they expect it all the time. It use to be as soon as I lay my daughter down alone she would wake. Now if I lay her in her rocker and turn it on she will whisk right off to sleep. Try putting her in a swing or rocker and see if that helps. I would suggest letting her cry|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	It IS too early for the CIO method. It's ok to rock your baby to sleep. I still rock my 8 month old or lay down with him until he falls asleep. My 4 year old stepson was the same way, we layed down with him until he fell asleep until he was about 3 years old and then he was fine to fall asleep by himself with his nightlight and lullaby CD. If you were a baby, would you want to fall asleep by yourself or cuddled up with someone you love?|`|yAjAHADiaa	She's only 2 1/2 months old.  Yes it's too early.  If she's crying, it's because she wants you to comfort her, feed or change her.  She's not doing it just to be a stinker.  She is too young, 6 months or so is old enough.  By that time, they have adjusted to your sleeping schedule (night is bedtime, daylight is time to be awake) and they can understand that you are still around even if you leave them alone.      New babies don't know what is going on if you just disappear.  By the way, the crying it out method involves checking back in after 5 minutes, then 10, then 15, and so on until baby falls asleep. It ensures that they know you are still there but will not be giving in.  Don't pick them up, say a few words, soothe them and leave.  It took my daughter 3 nights of this when she was 6 months old.|`|DIZKlxNraa	i have the same problem with my 8 month old... never did cry it out... I would wait for that till baby is 6 months old at least but you can try other methods described in "no-cry sleep solution".|`|5DJcir9saa	I do a variation of the cry it out method and it might take a little extra effort at first, but it usually ends with good results.  I too, got my son in the habit of falling asleep while I rocked him but he now falls asleep on his own.  First of all, if she likes to be rocked before she goes to sleep then continue to rock her but once she starts to get a little drowsy, lay her down.  If she begins crying then go and  pick her up and comfort her until she relaxes. Then lay her back down.  If she starts to cry again do the same thing (don't run to her the second you hear her cry, you can let her cry for a few minutes to see if she'll soothe herself).  Continue to do this until she realizes she will have to soother herself to sleep.  This worked really well with my son.  He started sucking his thumb (to self soothe) when I first tried this method but has since stopped.  I like this method better than the cry it out method, simply because I feel bad if I just let him cry!|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Read "The no-cry sleep solutions" by Elizabeth Pantley, I'm sure you won't even consider CIO after that|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Yes. She is too young. If you want to use that method it is bet to wait until at least 6 months of age.    2 hours is WAY to long to let them cry even when they are age appropriate.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, it's far too early for CIO.    Pick her up, comfort her, put her back down when she calms but before she goes to sleep in your arms. Repeat as necessary.|`|zwctZ812aa	I would say it is too early for the cry it out method.  I don't believe in it until after a year, but that's just my personal opinion.  At this point, your daughter doesn't realize that she's manipulating you to pick her up by crying.  She sincerely just needs to be held and loved.  It is not too late to teach her to sleep by herself, she is still very young, but may just not be ready.There's nothing wrong with rocking your baby to sleep.  I still rock my 13 week old to sleep most of the time, but the last couple nights I have suddenly been able to put him down drowsy and he wakes up, looks at me, then closes his eyes and goes to sleep.  this is a totally new thing for him...I just kept trying.  When I layed him down, if he woke up and fussed I would pick him up and get him to sleep again and try over.  Good luck, I hope it happens as suddenly for you as it did for me, cuz it really is nice to just have them go to sleep.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	She will learn to fall asleep in her own time.  I personally would not use cry it out of any sort with a 12 wk old.  Not for me.  I could not let my kids cry for 2 hours straight even when i used my own modified version of cio - which apparently isn't even the actual method.  btw my kids were also way older babies than 12 weeks.  at this point, keep nursing her to sleep and rock her.  lay her down once shes asleep.  if she wakes up, repeat.  the time will come when she is old enough to fuss to sleep.  i knew with both of my kids when they started crying at bedtime when i entered their rooms.  when they were old enough to know what i was doing they were old enough to fall asleep on their own.  that was how i judged it.  keep feeding and rocking your baby to sleep.  i promise, its not bad at all to do it that way right now.  you will not spoil her or start a habit at this age.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sounds like you're already making her Cry it out.  Please do NOT leave her to cry for 2 hours!  What exactly do you hope to accomplish.    At this age it's perfectly normal for a baby to fall asleep at the breast, or being rocked in mama's arms.  There isn't a single thing wrong with it. If she wakes when you put her down, try waiting untl she's DEEPLY, limp, asleep.  Then keep a hand on her until she's calm and relaxed again. Or try leaving a bra or shirt in the cot with her. Your scent will comfort her.    She has plenty of time to learn to put herself to sleep. At 3 months she has a legitimate need to be held and rocked and comforted.  So please meet that need if you can.  In a few months she'll probably start staying awake longer after some feeds, and you can try putting her down awake.  But even then, I'd urge you to NOT use the 'extinction' method -- leaving baby to scream until she passes out from exhastion.  There are many gentler ways.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Awesome job, mama! Maybe you can be like this lady: http://www.truemomconfessions.com/confes...|`|ui7waO1haa	It's not too early for the "crying it out" method. If you wait on her hand and foot, she will learn that every time she needs something, she'll cry. That's a psychological thing, even in a twelve week old baby.
