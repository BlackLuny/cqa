ZOYyfBFYaa	No, there is a UK section for the sims 3 website, so if you are really concerned, contact EA or the contact you were given when you ordered the game. Make sure you only ordered it from the sims 3 website. I'm really excited for the game!|`|6STxgw9laa	Nah, GAME is a very mainstream and legit company so I doubt they would scam - they have probably ordered copies from the US and are selling them for a profit in the UK.     Hope I helped yer :P

NyyRuaVqaa	Lolita is not cosplay. Please recognize that Lolita is an alternative street fashion and subculture, not a bunch of costumes. There are girls who dress like this on a daily basis.    http://www.annahousefashion.com has the cheapest good quality lolita clothing in any webstore, and they will custom-size their clothing if you need it. Their dresses are about $100. (The prices are in Hong Kong dollars.) Yes, that's the cheapest. Anything you find much lower than that is going to be poorly made with awful materials. There's no getting around it.    I'm sorry if you think I'm coming off as anal, but I'm honestly not trying to. Lolita tend to get offended when you call our daily wear costumes, and what is costume-quality (whatever you'll find for $50 bucks on eBay for example) is not Lolita.

AA11968008	Seafarers of Catan is an expansion set. It brings new rules and options to The Settlers of Catan, the basic game. Seafarers is not an independent game. Seafarers can not be played without The Settlers of Catan.    There a lot of games in the Catan series. It can get confusing. As of this writing, Boardgame Geek is down for maintenance. When The Geek is back online look there if you are still unsure of what to buy.    Add: Okay, The Geek is back online. Go to this link: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3...|`|7ViNk0fOaa	Seafarers is one of many expansions to the base game.  You would need the original Settlers of Catan to play the Seafarers expansion. I've only ever played the basic game, but know people who will ONLY play it with another expansion called Cities and Knights!  There is also an expansion to add 5 and 6 players to the game. There is a stand alone space game (Starship Catan) but it is significantly different that the original.      I would suggest getting and playing only the original and then over time buy an expansion and play with it for a while, then get a second expansion and play with ONLY it for a while, then combine the two and play BOTH for a while.  Do this as you slowly add more expansions and determine which versions you enjoy the most.

7LUSfdgKaa	when you first come past the pool with the dogs in front of it theres a building straight ahead. remember that. drop your buddy by the wheel and run to the far side of the building and hide against it. not many baddies come after you there. and by not many i mean uhm none. you can literally sit on the far side of the building opposite where the baddies come from the entire time without firing a shot. chill till the helicopter lands, book it to grab your pal and throw him on the copter as fast as you can.<br>  works on veteran too.|`|2pEKV27Laa	ok there is a little snack shack lookin thing next to the ferris wheel, you should hide in there for the majority of the fight, you will get bombarded with grenades but if you keep kinda close to the entrance of the shack you can quickly throw them back. if you can throw the grenades as close to the enemy as possible. and do not exit the shack until the rescue helicopter arrives, then just run like hell|`|riay8u27aa	That part was complete hell for me.

The rush to the CHOPPA|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	One of the things I do is snipe the helicopter troops as they exit the heli. I can usually do this with two of the four helis.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of the 10 APMs you have (making sure they are far enough apart to not trigger each other) to mine the accesses to the "parking" area. Also, if necessary, re-arm with the weapons discarded around the area.<br>  <br>  I usually sit behind the tree just behind the ferris wheel, and periodically check the side closes to the wheel (I generally keep to McMillan's side). Also, make use of your grenades.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, if you don't have it, the second piece of intel is in the building to the S/S/W of the ferris wheel. Go all the way to the "road" leading from the pool (AFTER the helicopters drop their men), and approach from there. you will see the door opened, and the intel is inside. The first one is at the top of a fire escape not too far before the pool (just after you are have to "scout ahead" and have to deal with the two dogs and the trigger happy Russians...you'll know it's the right fire escape, because it's the only one that you have to use a ladder on. The intel is on the 3rd floor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bMRCtxEuaa	when your waiting for mcmillian to call the heli place C4 on cars and place claymores beside some cars so then they explode also find a shot gun and replace sniper with AK-47 then just go all out.you can hide behind places like buildings or the sheds.then all you do is kill the guys that come close to you and when the enemy helis come you can just spaz the people coming down|`|VSflEDUVaa	Before McMillan calls the helli, set all your claymores around the area in the open.

lot0fR44aa	it shouldnt be any harder to beat than any of the other pokemon games  every now and again u mite hit a stump and have to train your pokemon up more (reason i dont play pokemon games anymore) but other than that platinum shouldnt be any harder that diamond or pearl hope this helped:)|`|hNa5oHxQaa	It's about as hard as it is playing Pearl.|`|LnYr2dLfaa	It's not much harder than Diamond and Pearl if you played them enough. If you are new to the Pokemon then it might be a little hard considering you are not use to the Pokemon feel.<br>  <br>  If you've played the other games for the Gameboy you should be fine.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Doesn't this game come out in March????<br>  <br>  <br>  Lisa|`|brVj9ktDaa	yeah hardest thing ever|`|1BHM6z8faa	No it is not i beat it in a week|`|q6OAn4UAaa	It's pretty rough, but if you train your guys equally you'll be fine. and are half of the people on here retards? they only answer questions for points..... i don't even know what points do. I think that if you put time into training your pokemon, you'll have a great platinum life.

elY5vkVyaa	Much to my annoyance the expensive pots of sand and gravel sold by Games Workshop look much better than normal sand; I sometimes use Sharps sand (builder's sand) but the GW stuff is what I primarily use.<br>  <br>  Plenty of tips and tutorials here:<br>  <a href="http://warhammer.org.uk/PhP/viewforum.php?f=4" rel="nofollow">http://warhammer.org.uk/PhP/viewforum.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/kb.php?mode=article&k=175" rel="nofollow">http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/kb.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.coolminiornot.com/go.php/go/articlephp/levels/99/expand/all?" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolminiornot.com/go.php/go/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.miniaturementor.com/painting_tutorials.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.miniaturementor.com/painting_...</a><br>  <br>  There are dozens of ways to decorate bases but the general rule for a good looking effect is to use a mix of textures and materials. If I'm doing a grassy base I use bare earth (sand), short grass (flock/scatter grass) and long grass (static grass).|`|kryCEpw0aa	The easiest way would be to coat on some watered down PVA glue or just regular elmer's glue and then dip the base into some sand or flock. Flock is obtainable at any crafts store. Then shake off the excess and let it dry for a while. There we go.|`|FhhDGg0eaa	Along with the answer above, GW also sells tubs of "static grass" that can be used in small spots to add stands of taller grass.<br>  <br>  Also when you are buying your sand, get the cheapest stuff you can find.  More expensive sand will be all fine grain sand, whereas the cheaper stuff will have larger chunks of sand or other rock mixed with the fine grain stuff.  It may not look great for bottled sand or other craft uses, but basing purposes its better as it will add some character and variety to your bases.<br>  <br>  You can also find bags of talus rock in model trains sections of hobby stores that that can be used for larger rocks to add individually or in clusters to add more variety.
2GNFQPdmaa	Either you got the flight point and it's not connected to Dal or you didn't get the FP yet. Make sure you have all your FPs in Borean and then go back to the basin. You can ride into schol by going north out of borean no problem, and you don't need to fly to get to any of the towns
ye9h5jXvaa	You can't give the animals a present when it's their birthday, unfortunately. It seems like you should be able to, since the game specifically tells you it's their birthday, but for some reason there's no way to give them a gift. About the best thing you can do is send a letter saying Happy Birthday, but they won't react any differently than they do to a normal letter. It's really sad Nintendo overlooked this.|`|otOu2cC6aa	I think you give it to them personally. go up to them, drop it on the ground and let them pick it up! simple! tell them its from you!|`|2df828c9feb3e4db13e2b12026ff8df8aa	Send them a letter on their birthday and attach a present to it.  Make sure you have the words Happy Birthday somewhere in the letter.  They will then reply the next day with a gift attached to their letter thanking you for making their day special, or words to that effect.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|F13Gjn6Haa	Be my friend on Wi-Fi first just read my question

UOncui9Waa	Seinfeld, Mortal Kombat, Windows 3.1, Nirvana
Hvd82Owiaa	You're really only giving half the story with the RAF program though.<br>  <br>  For anybody to get triple the experience, they have to be grouped with you. If the two accounts arent grouped, nobody receives triple experience. Also, as a trial account they can only level to 20 before they stop getting experience, then they have to upgrade their account in order to continue past level 20.<br>  <br>  Its nice you want to help others out, but you really should represent the program correctly. The way you did it here comes across as if you're trying take advantage of people.

AA12177717	You are the boss of your knitting, kiddo, and if this is for a border, it isn't going to hurt anything to change it.  However, you'll need to be aware that if the center of your blanket is stockinette stitch you will not have a smooth transition at the border, since every other row you'll have a knit stitch where the knitting begins on the one face and a purl stitch where the purls begin on the other.  IOW, use stitch markers so you remember where the borders are.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	yeah you can exchange the garter stitch for seed stitch, all you need to do is make sure that you have the right gauge.

l6lh6fT8aa	You seem to be set into a pre-creature update mindset. I believe around Mirrodin or Kamigawa block, all creature types lost any extra rules text (i.e. even a Wall could attack, except that all Walls were errata'd and given Defender). <br>  <br>  The same is true for Flagbearer.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	1) They are a wall and CAN attack.<br>  They actually changed it from how it used to be (aka, how you know walls). All of the old cards with the "wall" creature type gained the "Defender" keyword (This creature cannot attack). So yes, they are a wall. However, they no longer automatically gain Defender just for being a wall, so they can still attack.<br>  <br>  2) They are also a flagbearer. Actually, the flagbearer ability was printed on the cards themselves. If you have one of them out, the Changeling would count as a flagbearer. However, the opponent only has to select ONE target as a flagbearer, so it won't force them to target the changeling unless to make it the only flagbearer on the field (hard to do).<br>  <br>  3) Same as 2. You can actually use Unnatural Selection to change your flagbearer's type to something else and make an opponent's creature the only flagbearer on the field. Then they have to target it! (If they normally could; no countering things that are already in play, or anything silly like that). <br>  <br>  Your flagbearer doesn't retain its old type because it says "Target creature's type becomes that type until the end of turn" instead of "Target creature's type becomes that type in addition to its other types until the end of turn"|`|DdkyUEnhaa	Changeling (This card is every creature type at all times)<br>  <br>  Creature TYPE is not to be confused with ABILITIES or KEYWORDS.<br>  <br>  Changeling itself is an ability. Defender is an ability. Wall is not an ability, it is a creature type, therefore the changeling can attack regularly.<br>  <br>  Creature type has absolutely no effect on the creature itself unless noted otherwise by another card.<br>  <br>  Check the link, it should help.

One site is called www.download-full-games.com.  I would only try that if you're really desperate.  I myself think that I'm going to use ebay if the price is right.  <br>  <br>  There are also torrent sites like isohunt that you can download the game from, but I'm not sure that it's a good legal option.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|A1BJdVyhaa	You probably can if you look hard enough.

qbmkMWqeaa	Pokemon breeding works very simply. First you have to find out which egg group a particular pokemon is.. for example Eevee, which is Normal.  Being Normal, eevee can breed with any other normal pokemon, even Hippowdon.<br>  .<br>  <br>  Take a Female Eevee and a Male Hippowdon  and put them in the day care and after a few hundred steps or you will have a baby eevee, and if the Hippowdon  knows it, the baby will have the egg/breeding move Yawn. the father will also pass down certain TMs and HMs...<br>  <br>  <br>  But from the sound of your question, the best answer I can say is, you get what you breed...if you want an eevee, you need to breed a female eevee.  You can't take a torkoal and a Tauros and get a Delcatty..it doesn't work that way.

WxmNSxNGaa	Bring whatever you don't mind spending. A few hundred bucks will usually last awhile at $5-$10 a hand, but sometimes you'll lose that in an hour (or less). If you happen to lose it too fast, you can always just hang around, drop a 20 or two in a video poker machine (that'll last you an hour), or just watch whomever you're with play. By the time you play in your two poker tournaments and have dinner, you won't have to kill that much time playing blackjack, so just take whatever you're comfortable with losing. $550 or so will be plenty ($240 for poker, the rest for blackjack) but if you only feel like spending $100 at the blackjack table it's not like there's nothing else to do.|`|85AoQYh8aa	i would say stick with the poker if you think your skills are there.  Really dont see why anyone would play blackjack knowing the more hands they play the more likely they are to lose money.  I would say you bring a thousand and if your more comfortable with the sngs then play those but if you can find a 1/2 cash game the fish there are sooo nice.  Hell even the so called regulars at these tables are easily manipulated, but there will be a few you dont want to get tangled up with.  Really observe the table when you sit down just seeing everyones table presence will tell you alot.<br>  <br>  With poker it can be opposite depending on your knowledge and skills and your opponents|`|d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	I don't think you'll find any blackjack tables for under $15 at the Borgata, and on weekends if its crowded you may need to play $25 a hand.  I may be wrong, because I haven't been at the Borgata in awhile.  Bally's advertises some $10 tables at all times (in the Clairidge).  You definitely won't find a $5 table in Atlantic City except possibly on a weekday morning when the casino is empty.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by a sit-n-go, but I will assume you are just risking $240 and will take an hour or two for these.  Figure another hour or two for lunch and/or dinner.  So lets say you'll be playing $15 a hand blackjack for 6 hours.  I don't think that $500 is enough if you're not doing well (assuming you lose $240 on the sit-n-gos you only have $260 remaining).  Most likely $1000 will be enough, and if you are doing bad you can take some breaks in between or spend more time at lunch and dinner.|`|boWDjT9Gaa	If you're going for that long of a time, I would say bring at least $500 but, have $1000 to be safe.  My best friend always brings several thousand ($3k for example) to be sure when we play for long periods of time. Unless you're a really, good blackjack player, you'll be tapped out sooner than you think. Good luck.
LnYr2dLfaa	The older Prince of Persia games were the best. I don't much care for the new ones, mainly because it doesn't feel as original as the old ones; much like every game series. Sands of Time or Warrior Within are most likely my favorites of the series.<br>  <br>  Legend of Zelda is pretty close; anything from Ocarina of Time onwards.|`|ApAuRnCeaa	I dont think they are that great, but i am not an adventure game type person.|`|zm7aBc8Xaa	I like them all and they all are very fun to play because with the adventure and all the jumps and runs you can do, so it is very fun...FOR ME.|`|UJbKH9yWaa	gaaaaaay
LItIiiHKaa	The concept itself is related to the ratio of your bet to what could be made if you win the hand and the odds of winning it.  <br>  <br>  Simple pot odds determine how much you're putting in versus what's in there now.  For instance if it costs you a buck and there's 3 bucks in there now you need to win 3 out of 4 times to break even.  So you assess your chances of winning and if it's this or better you call.<br>  <br>  It's not all that simple though which is why what you really want to do is to figure out how much you will need to put in the pot and how much you will win in the end, which is more complicated but gives you a much better idea of whether you have the odds to call.  Newer players though are advised to start with the simple pot odds and as they get better they will get a better feel for what the real odds are.  <br>  <br>  Figuring out your chances of winning isn't as easy as it seems as well.  Newer players will assume that if they improve their hand they will win but in reality this isn't always the case and you can hit your hand and lose a lot of money to a better hand as well.  However again it's best to start out simple and then refine your calculations as you understand these concepts better.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	im not sure what you mean by "pot odds" i suggest you play for free at  a free poker web site to learn more about the game|`|85AoQYh8aa	pot odds is pretty simple lets say the pot is at $40 and someone throws out a $10 bet if this is the case you are getting 4:1 odd which is very good in most cases.  So getting 4:1 odds justifies you calling a hand where you feel you have AT LEAST a 25% of winning now this is just going by pot odds if you feel this guy will pay off your hand if you make the winning hand you can justify calling with even less of a winning percentage this is a simple explanation of implied odds, which a lot of players will call you a donkey after you take all their chips when you were calling without pot odds and hit your hand.<br>  <br>  anyways im not huge into pot odds i almost always put the decision on my opponent by betting and making him correctly calculate pot odds and implied.  But if im pretty confident i know his hand i will make sure i dont give him the odds to call<br>  <br>  But in reality they made your play the correct one and they are the donks for making the final call.<br>  <br>  wow 2 thumbs down i didnt think i was that far off, I know king kobra threw out one of them who so confidently answered a simple NL holdem question wrong earlier

oHOBStehaa	Wow a dragon deck. It is fine, but this deck cannot really win in the regionals because there are a lot of serious duelists there. Also, even if Tele_DAD is nerfed on the March 20009 banlist, it can still win, especially against this deck. I can see that it is more of a dragon beatdown of fusions. <br>  First off, you need some kind of drawing power. You can stall with you Spirit Reaper and Marshmallon to wait for the cards you want but card effects would wipe it out eventually. Second, this is a fusion deck and I don't see a Polymerization. I know it is slow and a pain to have but really, if you pulled off FGD with it, a Dragon's Mirror would finish them off. For your traps, you should probably get better ones, such as Mirror Force and Magic Cylinder.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Monsters: 19<br>  3 Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon<br>  2 Prime Material Dragon<br>  2 Tiger Dragon<br>  1 White-Horned Dragon<br>  1 Cyber Dragon<br>  3 Blizzard Dragon<br>  3 Red-Eyes Wyvern<br>  2 Mirage Dragon<br>  2 Plaguespreader Zombie<br>  <br>  Spells: 11<br>  2 Dragon's Mirror<br>  1 Future Fusion<br>  2 Stamping Destruction<br>  2 Foolish Burial<br>  1 Soul Taker<br>  1 Heavy Storm<br>  1 Monster Reborn<br>  1 Brain Control<br>  <br>  Traps: 10<br>  1 Mirror Force<br>  1 Magic Cylinder<br>  2 Compulsory Evacuation Device<br>  2 Bottomless Trap Hole<br>  2 Dimensional Prison<br>  2 Dust Tornado<br>  <br>  Total: 40 cards<br>  <br>  Extra Deck: 15<br>  2 Five-Headed Dragon<br>  2 Red Dragon Archfiend<br>  3 Goyo Guardian<br>  2 Thought Ruler Archfiend<br>  3 Stardust Dragon<br>  1 Black Rose Dragon<br>  1 Magical Android<br>  1 Chimeratech Fortress Dragon
8hbm4uiPaa	First, you have too many land for RDW.  You certainly don't need to go above 22, if that high.  The last thing you want to be doing in RDW is top-decking land in the late game when you really want a burn spell to finish off your opponent.<br>  <br>  I would also main-deck Volcanic Fallout.  There really are not going to be many times when you don't want to see that card (unless you are under 2-life) and it will win plenty of matchups, especially against Faeries, Kithkin and B/W Tokens, three top-tier decks that are very prevalent in Standard.<br>  <br>  When playing RDW, you really want to win game 1 so you have two shots of winning the match.  There are plenty of cards that hate against red that might make your final two games difficult (Burrenton Forge-Tender, Ruined Halo, Story Circle)<br>  <br>  When picking cards for the sideboard, you really want those cards to be the best cards in your deck once you have sided them in, otherwise, you have to question why you didn't have them in the main-deck to start with.<br>  <br>  I would sideboard Moonglove Extract.  It's the one card you can run that will deal with Burrenton Forge-Tender, or anything else that has protection from red.<br>  <br>  Unwilling Recruit and Vexing Shusher are fine for the sideboard, as they qualify as cards that can be very good against certain decks.  Hell's Thunder is one of those cards that you either play or you don't, so I wouldn't put it in the board.|`|l3GfXTBpaa	Murderous Redcap's are good. <br>  Deck looks like your standard RDW.

I don't think they'll continue with that naming scheme. They only named that because they thought it would cause a "revolution" in gaming, notice the quotes. I personally would like the next one be called Xbox3 (cubed). It makes more sense; it's the third installment of the Xbox series and a box is cubed, Ah, right? Get it?<br>  <br>  Anyway, what console is best and why depends on your preferences. Right now, the Wii is outselling everything, but only because of the legions of loyal nintendo fans who remember the good old days and paste that over reality. Then there are the sheer number of young children who are captivated by actually making objects move by corresponding with their movements. But really the Xbox is a solid piece of hardware, a little outdated, but still beefy enough. the PS3 is a monster, it's basically a computer, but it's too expensive right now.

T8AvZltDaa	No you cant do that in No-limit Texas Hold em, or most other gambling card games|`|y822j5h5aa	NO. Negotiations during play for chips or for cards are generally not permitted. In this case you would have been offering him chips to fold his hand, and this is not permitted!<br>  <br>  Often however, in live play,  there are usually no rules for sidebets, and sometimes you can hedge the river with a side bet. For example, since you were both all in, and knew he could only win with a K, you could make a side bet of 100 chips at 12 to 1 that the river card would be a king. If it is not a king, you lose 100 chips and win the pot, if it is a king you lose the pot, but win 1200 chips.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to determine whether side bets are allowed before you start to play, and try this sometime, you will be surprised how often a player will accept the bet. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

dZ3B2vNIaa	Clothespin doll:  Glue a pompom to the top of a clothespin.  Make sure you glue it to the end that clips.  Glue pieces of yarn to the head for hair. Carve a hole with a thin knife or screwdriver.  Cut a piece off a popsicle stick thin enough to fit through the hole.  Tape a little skirt made out of felt to her.<br>  <br>  Stuffed Animal Jacket:  Take an old handkerchief and cut the pointed end off of it.  Cut holes near the ends for the armholes.<br>  <br>  Storage Box:  Take an old shoebox and wrap it in fancy wrapping paper, cover and all.  Write: _________'s Storage box.  ( write the line too so the person buying can personalize it.)<br>  <br>  Stuffed Animal Poncho:  Take a sheet of fabric and fold it in half.  Starting from the top of the sheet, cut the top of the poncho, then cut down until you have a poncho shape cut out.  Cut the hole where the head will come out and cut little ruffles at the bottom.  ( I'm meaning those little string things that hang off it)  <br>  <br>  Dog Bed:  Take two old blankets and sew them carefully together.  Leave a large, unsewed hole before you close it up with the finishing stitches and stuff cotton balls and similar-feeling stuffing inside it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
y02PZj22aa	For that age, you'll probably have better luck looking for a bodysuit or leotard.

But if you really want an all out war expierence, try Battlefield Bad Company, but only if you have Xbox Live.

All those other games are overrated.|`|VSflEDUVaa	Its kind of hard to compare all of these games, because of how diverse they are. For the TPS, go Gears. For the FPS, go Halo 3.

MFAVIW1waa	It's Unown. You can find them in the cave near Solaceon Town. Fly there and head north but don't leave the town and then turn right, keep going then go down once you can't go right any more. Jump over the ledges but make sure you don't jump over the last one and turn right and head up into the cave. You can catch all of them (26, A-Z) if you want to or just catch one then go get your pokedex upgraded.|`|Oi7W2R5Maa	Here Is the list<br>      Kanto#   Sinnoh#   Name   Types   HP   Atk   Def   Spd

TQQMM1ivaa	Hi, I copied this from NeoSeeker, I think it's the same one I use.  This is for both Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.  Make sure you have the FCFF right, as I cannot tell you how much that frustrated me when I messed it up and it didn't work. XD<br>  EDIT - Some of the names are spelled wrong on the code that the person typed.  I had to just paste the URL because yahoo cut half of the code off.  I could email you with the rest if you'd like, but the URL is <br>  <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/DS/pokemon_diamond/action_replay.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/...</a><br>  for this one you press L and R to activate it.  If you use ctrl and F on the Neoseeker page and type in mining, I believe it's the fifth one you find.  This code doesn't mess up your game as far as I've experienced (knock on wood) and I've done it with 4 of my friends' cartridges so far.<br>  <br>  94000130 fcff0000<br>  B21c4d28 00000000<br>  B0000004 00000000<br>  10001170 00000***<br>  D2000000 00000000|`|msJ6xiBVaa	go on google, type in pokemon action replay codes, and it will list a bunch of sites, and then just find the code you need :)

QzD3rJtMaa	Well first of all, Allure is at 2 now.  Second, why in the world do you not have a Chaos Sorcerer in here?  This deck was the main reason they unbanned it.  I'd make this deck myself, but I don't have that kind of money.  Another good addition to this deck would be Gold Sarcophagus.  Once Gold Series 2 comes out, you should try to get 2 and add them in this deck.  It'll help to get your 2 main win condition cards, JD and DAD, before they get milled.  I also just realized that you have no Honest?  You can't have a Lightsworn or a Twilight deck without having 3 Honest.  If you have them, then add them.  If you don't, then shell out the money to get them.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest a little change in your deck format.  This deck is basically running like a Lightsworn deck, so it needs to be of the same format.  Therefore, you should have 1 CCV and 2 or 3 Beckoning Light, no Solemns and no TMP.  Your Spells look fine minus the 1 Allure you need 2 take out.  You definitely need more monsters.  This is where adding the 3 Honest and Chaos Sorcerer come in.  I'd also say to take out the Crows as I don't see a need for them here.  As for what to replace them with, that is up to you.  Don't worry about going over 40 cards as it is not a problem with this deck as you will be milling a lot.  So having a few extra cards is to your advantage here.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if this looks sloppy.  A lot of it is out of order of how I wanted to say it.  I kept going back and forth looking at your deck and kept noticing different things about it every time I looked at it.  lol.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	As of March 1st:<br>  Allure of Darkness = LIMITED to 2<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://shriek.twoday.net/stories/5521523/" rel="nofollow">http://shriek.twoday.net/stories/5521523...</a><br>  <br>  Why no Chaos Sorcerer?

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	First things first...do you have a High Speed 'net connection. If you don't...don't bother, you won't be able to play on-line anyway.    Secondly...does your computer have the heart and legs to run the game? Use the link below to have it scan your system (the instructions are pretty self explanatory).     If your computer will run the game...it will cost you $10 less than the X-Box version did. As for being identical...no. The PC version has a bit more game-play, for several reasons. Since it is technically still a "new" game, it should run you about $50CAD or so. (US price slightly lower?)    If you have friends who have it on PC, or plan to join a clan, a decent headset will be a must. (You can use the in-game client, or another client like X-Fire, etc, for Voice Chat.) On the other hand, if you just want to play for fun, it's purely optional.    Good Luck!

GTA IV online is better??? dont listen to that kid he doesnt know what hes talking about. cod 5 is one of the best online games you can get. simple fact. i only have world at war for the online play, i havent even touched the single player. i think you should convince them to get you live and play there, but if that doesnt work then get it for the PC
EmBsBvJJaa	well since you guys are older, maybe instead of like babysitting all of you in each of your neighborhoods could do a daycare kinda thing.or if you want it to b more fundraiser(ish) then you could auction off clothes that you dont want anymore but for a low price.i did it once i was like rich!:) but then i spent it all!hope this helped! :)
kIqq7yIAaa	yes this is normal    your toy is picking up interference from outside sources  this happens if you live near any sort of broadcast tower or military base  by law your toy must accept any outside signal even if it causes unwanted or erratic operation  to avoid this situation ensure it is turned off when not being used  another option would be to change the frequency the toy operates on  but be dvised this can be far more costly than the toy was to buy|`|mZspb59xaa	i used to have this book when i was ten and when you opened the cover it made a screaming noise. it woke up my mom screaming while it was closed and freaked her out when she was sleeping!!! be carefull, you never know what toys can do when they are possessed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|SxuUFOATaa	a lot of radio operated toys operate on the same (or close) frequency as CB radios.     someone was close enough to interfere.

nsUeaPCLaa	Forget manhunt. Play your own game of man tracker. You are spit up into 2 teams. If there is 5 people, 2 are trackers, 3 are runners, The 2 people get bikes, the others run. The objective for the runners objective is to get to the destination without being touched by the people riding bikes. Everyone (runners and bikers) start off at the same spot, and the runners get a head start (you can choose how long.) mix the rules up a bit. I suggest roads only except for backyards of the people you know. and create boundaries,  But if you still want to play manhunt,

440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I don't have the game and I couldn't find a solution to your problem on their website. However, you could try creating a temporary folder and then copying the entire CD/DVD into the folder you created. Then, try and install the game from there. Make sure you leave the CD/DVD in the drive just incase it need to verify you own the program.<br>  <br>  You might have to create your own shortcut Icons for the game if it doesn't do it on its own, but that's no big deal. You may also need to adjust the properties, so that you're using the Windows XP compatible mode, since the program is so old.<br>  <br>  Once you have it installed, you should be able to go back and delete the temp folder you created for the install.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

8563099a1dde3cb3254ad0e9f0ba8ad0aa	Depends on the Hollywood Video, if you tried it with mine, I would not return the game and let it sit over in the corner for 50 days, then it will go to collections where they will charge you full price for the game.   (and maybe the late fee too, whic will be about 50).  We check the disks every time, especially with x360 cause the ring of death on the disk.  You would have to buy the game from hollywood video if you returned the scratched one. That's also beside the moral factor, you damaged it you pay for it.  Hell if its a old game, you could get it cheap there or some where else.

If you are playing with the traditional format then this deck's requirements is fine. Second, what is the theme of this deck. I can't see any strategies in here. No offense but this is one of the most random decks of all. You gotta have some kind of strategy and theme. Ex. Theme: Lightsworn deck ; Strategy: Swarming<br>  <br>  I don't know man, but this is really weird.<br>  <br>  PS You don't need to tell the rarity of the card. It kinda makes it worse.
Wmn5Bh1Zaa	I just bought an eastsheen 4x4 and it is great.  Perfect size for my hands and rarely locks up if at all.  100x better than the Rubik's brand.  <br>  <br>  I have NEVER used a Meffert's brand cube, to be honest I didn't even know that they made anything other than the megaminx.  But I recommend you purchase an eastsheen 4x4 from ebay.  I got mine from huskyomega for really cheap, and it shipped quickly (considering it came from Taiwan)
5zu7AdlKaa	i remember that game you had to chase the guy in the shadow with the cool slide cant remember what its called
eU0eQ9EWaa	More claustrophobic environments. Yeah, I know, they would kill you easily if you got stuck in one. But hey? If you're outfitted with a nice slice-n-dice weapon, why not?<br>  <br>  More ammo overall for the weapons. And lots of explosives. Rocket launchers, grenades, mines, you name it.<br>  <br>  A higher level cap to keep the game fresh. At least up to 100. They should work more into a higher Stock space count. That would be nice.<br>  <br>  More crazy things to kill zombies with! They implemented some very unique weapons like the Excavator and the Mega Man cannon. <br>  <br>  Smarter AI. For both the zombies and the rescued people (the rescued people need a lot more work. The zombies need to act a bit stupider, yet smarter at the same time. Gee, maybe they're fine the way they are?)<br>  <br>  MULTIPLE save slots. What a pain in the BUTT starting over again because I screwed myself over on the cases one time (and I got kinda far). I think they'll address this problem though.<br>  <br>  I can't believe I'm saying this, but more variety in the food. Some of the stuff they put in was okay, but to really get those unique food boosters, you had to cook them or do something behind the counter of a store. This was a bit annoying, and they should reduce this a bit. Not take it off completely.<br>  <br>  Overall, this game will own. And if Capcom comes through, they will have crafted yet another beautiful zombie apocalypse survival horror (kind of) game.|`|Gs5TMXfHaa	Obviously more crazy weapons to bludgeon the crap out of zombies with. And lots of more humor, I think that's important in that type of zombie game and I love it when it exists in abundant proportions. Most importantly, however, I'd like for there to either be an online playmode or co-op, because THAT would be intense and instead of having to make my girlfriend sit down and watch me kill thousands of zombies she could partake in the action. Come on, Capcom!<br>  <br>  PS. More save slots...how do you only put 1 in a game like this where you can screw things up? I mean, honestly what the hell?|`|AA11083526	None of those lame cutscenes when I'm kicking *** and taking names, then having to start over by taking out all of the zombies again, like in the grocery store for example.

zkscW8seaa	Edward is right, trading Honest for Rainbow Dark Dragon is a horrible trade. Why? Simply put, Honest can be used in more Decks and isn't such a pain in the butt to get out. Rainbow Dark Dragon requires 7 different named DARK monsters in your Graveyard, that's huge! Honest on the other hand, pulls out a D.D. Crow type move on your opponent's attacking monster, inflicting possible severe damage, definitely better than RDD.|`|beRLnydHaa	dont trde that thats a rare if you want to trade it trade it for a regular rainbow dragon then change your deck to elementals because you can fuse neos with rainbow dragon ot make rainbow neos 4500 atk. and  2500 def.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	No, Honest is worth waaay more than that junk dragon.

Honest can range from $40-$60, while Rainbow Dark is about $15-$20.  You would definitely need more.  Besides Honest is an amazing card that can be used in a lot of good decks, while Rainbow Dark just sucks and shouldn't ever be used, even in a Dark deck.  lol.  I wouldn't do the trade even if they were of equal value.|`|XiOfPxpdaa	hell i'd give you my light and darkness dragon or caus emperor dragon envoy of the end for honest

Space Marines are awesome, and cheaper.|`|IfXJk1qoaa	Hmm, I don't have the new Imperial Guard codex (did that even come out yet?) but GW rules are generally the same across the board.  I'd say no, and I base that on the Eldar forge world lists, which don't allow you to mix and match soldiers from different forge worlds.

MsBujfBDaa	Excellent stats! Far as I can see, you have lots of ways to make money. I'll list them:    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    >>>> One of the best ways to make money is, no doubt, green dragons. Your combat stats are similar to mine, so I'd say you should take an anti-dragon shield, great armor, and about 20 lobsters. A WHIP is highly recommended, and watch out for revanants! Your prayer will help you out.    STATS TRAINED: Attack / Defence / Strength / Magic / Range.    PROFIT PER HOUR: 150k.    >>>> Then there's thieving! I would recommend going to Draynor and pickpocketing the master farmer - you get at least 2 ranarr seeds per hour! In case you don't know, ranarr's are worth around 30k EACH SEED. There are several other valuable seeds you can steal, so get to it! I would recommend taking 3 lobsters with you if you're staying for an hour.    STATS TRAINED: Thieving    PROFIT MADE PER HOUR: 40k to 150k.    >>>> Mining is a classic way of making money. At your level, I would recommend mining gold, and as you get to higher levels, you can mine more valuable ores. A great reward of reaching a high level in mining is the ability to mine RUNITE ore, which sells for 12k a piece! The competition is fierce, but the money made? Tons of it.    STATS TRAINED: Mining    PROFIT MADE PER HOUR: 100k to 400k    >>>> Woodcutting is the best way to make money for non-members, and it's a great way to make money for members, too. At your woodcutting level, cutting yews would be best, and at level 80, you should transfer over to magic logs. Level 80 because at that level, you can actually compete with the other people trying to cut mages. It's one of the best ways to make money because you can be on another site while you woodcut, and all you'd have to do is check on it from time to time.    STATS TRAINED: Woodcutting    PROFIT MADE PER HOUR: 60k - 150k      >>>> Although you haven't listed your hunting level, you don't need more than level 1 hunting to make 100k per hour! Yep, all you need is a noose wand, and feet. Runescape feet. All you do is track polar kebbits, and collect their fur. Drop the bones and meat - it's worth nothing, almost. Be aware that polar kebbits are located far north into runescape, so an amulet of glory is recommended, since it's a long distance to travel. The area is north of Relleka.     STATS TRAINED: Hunting    PROFIT MADE PER HOUR: 100k  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _       Thus, I conclude my methods. Hope this helped!|`|FZFQi97kaa	Depending on your fishing, go to Catherby/Fishing Guild, and fish sharks/swordfish, get atleast 1k of either and then sell.|`|Iva8drdfaa	What is your level, and what are your skills, and how much oney do you have?    VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV    Well, you didn't list your fishing level.  And this is one of the better ways to do it, In my opinion.  Well, if your fishing is above 63, go to the Fishing Guild, and fish for Lobsters, or Swordfish, until you reach level 80.      By then, you'll be sitting on more than 5mil.    VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV    But killing Dragons or Fire Giants does good as well, as you can sell the Hides and Bones, to make profit, while boosting your combat stats.  Especially good for ranged training.    VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV    Then wodcutting.  Cut Maples until you can cut magics, as Yews, are always crowded and slow.  Then cut magics, until you reach lvl 80 woodcutting.  You should be sitting on a lot of money by then as well.|`|nMWtEmEFaa	Fish for some lobsters and then sell them in the marketplace. I easily got to 2mil in just one week just by doing that. You have to be a paid members though, to get to the best area to fish for lobsters (well at least the areas that have a bank close to them). The best spot to fish for lobsters is at Catherby (for paid members). For free members, it's at Karajamia island.    Don't forget to buy a cage.|`|DdqAM9Yiaa	playing the fool being smarter than a noob or on runescape i collect silver i mine my self i have 105497k of silver ill give you 10000 of it m,y runescape name is iggymydog|`|sIhDawUpaa	well there r a couple ways for example, you can cut yews or magics.

wbIEau0qaa	Formerly a human ninja and member of the Japanese ninja clan Shirai Ryu, Scorpion is now a hell spawned revenant, inexorably seeking vengeance against those responsible for the destruction of his clan and the death of his family. Although essentially neutral in allegiance, Scorpion will align with anyone who can assist his plans of revenge. In addition, he is usually portrayed as a villain in other media due to his hell spawned specter nature, unrelenting lust for revenge and menacing appearance. He was once manipulated by Quan Chi, who promised him life in exchange for his impressive combat abilities in order to defeat Sub-Zero. Since Scorpion is a specter, sorcery and supernatural anomalies have proven effective against him in battle, though none have ever succeeded in destroying him in an absolute sense.      [edit] Storyline  "Scorpion" was the code name of one of the Shirai Ryu's finest warriors: a ninja assassin named Hanzo Hasashi. His father, a former clansman, forbade his son from joining as he did not wish him to live an assassin's life, but his request fell on deaf ears because Hanzo wanted a comfortable life for his wife and son. During the events of Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero, he was enlisted by Quan Chi to find a map hidden in a Shaolin temple. However, Quan Chi had also hired Sub-Zero  Scorpion's arch nemesis and member of the rival Lin Kuei clan  as insurance in case Scorpion failed in his mission.    They met while reaching for the same map they were sent out to acquire. A battle ensued, with Sub-Zero decapitating Scorpion and leaving his corpse where it fell. Scorpion's soul entered the Netherealm, where he had to decide whether to stay there for eternity, or to return to the world of the living as a specter while losing any memory of his past and his family. Fueled by anger and the desire for revenge, Scorpion opted for the latter, upon learning that the Lin Kuei had massacred his family as well as his entire clan. He vowed to kill Sub-Zero in retaliation for his own murder.       Scorpion, as depicted in John Tobias' comicScorpion would not come in contact with Sub-Zero again until Sub-Zero had been sent by Raiden to enter the Netherealm to regain an amulet from Shinnok and Quan Chi. He bested Scorpion once more in battle before retrieving the amulet. Once back on Earth, Sub-Zero was invited to participate in the Mortal Kombat tournament, but little did he know that Scorpion had been invited as well. The two interacted on Shang Tsung's boat en route to his private island, with Scorpion declaring that he would seek revenge for his death at the tournament.    While Scorpion and Sub-Zero never met during the actual tournament, they did meet in its closing moments. True to his word, Scorpion slew his nemesis in a fight to the death, and then disappeared back to the Netherealm in a burst of flames and ash. Scorpion learned of Sub-Zero's plans to compete in the second tournament. Enraged at the idea that he had somehow returned, Scorpion tracked him down during the tournament, during which he noticed Sub-Zero sparing the life of a fallen opponent. He realized that this Sub-Zero was actually his killer's younger brother, who was sent to complete his brother's failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, Scorpion vowed to serve as Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.    When Shao Kahn tried to conquer the Netherealm after his invasion of Earth, Scorpion was inadvertently set free, and he pledged allegiance to no one. Kahn, however, recognized Scorpion's skills, and enlisted the ninja in his forces. Scorpion's allegiance to Kahn quickly dissolved when he discovered that Sub-Zero was one of Earth's chosen warriors, with whom he then sided in their final showdown with Kahn. However, he came to believe that the younger Sub-Zero was actually involved in the deaths of his family and clan, and Quan Chi offered him life in exchange for his assistance in the war with the Elder Gods; Scorpion accepted simply for the opportunity to face Sub-Zero in combat, in which he emerged victorious. However, Quan Chi revealed afterward that he himself had orchestrated the murders, and as he sent Scorpion back to the Netherealm, Scorpion grabbed him in the midst of his spell, sending them both into the dreaded realm.    Scorpion while trapped in the Netherealm tortured Quan Chi. He eventually struck a deal with Drahmin and Moloch, who fought off Scorpion for him and enabled him to escape. Scorpion followed him, but was deposited in a different location by the portal. He continued to hunt Quan Chi until Drahmin and Moloch, who threw him into the Soulnado, believing that it would kill Scorpion once and for all, ambushed him. Scorpion managed to escape into the Void before the purity of the Soulnado tore him apart. There, he met the Elder Gods, who were aware of his presence and enhanced his mortal and supernatural abilities, and gave him a new mission to seek and destroy|`|5NpI6rLwaa	What the first guy said :)|`|4b00d9a31d6a0bab2ccf1a1493eca11faa	Formerly a human ninja and member of the Japanese ninja clan Shirai Ryu, Scorpion is now a hell spawned revenant, inexorably seeking vengeance against those responsible for the destruction of his clan and the death of his family.|`|gKEbUVtfaa	Well if you know scorpion you should know that he has NO skin.

Someone who trades away a game gets the same points that it costs the person to receive it.  <br>  <br>  Another great thing is that when you join Goozex you get 100 points free and one free trading credit.  That is enough to buy an older game.   THEN, when you've done a successful trade (which costs you nothing because of your free credit), you get another 100 points.   <br>  <br>  If you refer a friend you both get 1 credit and 100 more points.   In fact, if you want to join, use my referral code if you want.  It's will help us both out.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goozex.com/referral.asp?idr=6168034505119" rel="nofollow">http://www.goozex.com/referral.asp?idr=6...</a><br>  <br>  Feel free to email me for help or more questions too.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	Yes its legit email me and ill help you<br>  I have gotten games from there if you want u can add me as your referral so you can get extra points when u send a game out<br>  The games can come in different conditions from new-not working. Don't worry about it not working because they have a system to work that issue out. If its doesn't work they make you send the game so they can check and they reimbursh your money for shipping game|`|wbcmHJ3waa	scam city on the website
wMeqWUZoaa	its becuase the original creator left squaresoft/enix to make his own company, called mistwalker on the xbox...why??? because after his two big flops final fantasy spirits within and final fantasy xi online didt so poorly he lost alot of money and xbox being the the company that buys people off..offered him alot of money to ditch the company thta was once ps exlusive to make a new company soly for the xbox...ie called mistwalker...now you know....|`|uctxzjIIaa	Every FInal Fantasy released so far (other than a few of the handheld games) was already deep into development by the time the SquareEnix merger was official, and the process of actually combining the business wasn't completed until just about a month before FF XII was released.<br>  <br>  Wait until FF XIII before you start talking about Enix having made any changes whatsoever to Final Fantasy.|`|siUZ513taa	I agree.  Don't know why exactly, but ever since then everything hasnt been so great (Except for a few exceptions)

MiulNPYNaa	Well you can't tap it if it is used to play a spell, because it is already tapped in order to play the spell. If you destroy the land that was used to play the spell? Nothing, the land is destroyed but your opponents spell still resolves as normal, because the spell has already been paid for using the mana in your opponents mana pool when his land was tapped. You destroy his land in response to him playing the spell, but the spell is already placed on the stack, your "destroy land" resolves, destroying his land, but his spell will still resolve as normal. I hope this is what you were asking :)|`|Hp18CSwLaa	when you tap a land, it adds mana to a "mana pool." Even if the land is destroyed, the mana stays. no mana is lost.|`|d6QY6Rljaa	Once a land is tapped, the mana goes into the "Mana Pool" for later use during that turn. So, even if you destroy a land the opponent is tapping, as long as it was tapped for mana, the mana stays. I have had fights over this, because I abused this rule so much -_-. Now, rather or not that rule has changed in the past 2 years, I wouldnt know, but thats what I remember.
