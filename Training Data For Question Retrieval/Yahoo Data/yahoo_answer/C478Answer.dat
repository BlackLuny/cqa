Or use it as a coffee table, sit it next to the couch it will come in handy to put drinks and books and stuff on when your sitting on the couch.   I have a crappy old tv stand with wheels that i have sitting next to my couch with a nice scarf over it, its good cos its big enough to put some some picture frames and stuff and still enough room to sit a cup of coffee, it's also good cos it has storage space underneath where I put books magazines and board games. You just need to use your imagination!!  :-)|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You now have a stool, a hassock, a plant stand, or an end table.

ElBaODCCaa	Is it solid wood? If so,  You can use a liquid de glosser or liquid sanding solution to take of the varnish.   You then have a couple of options.  1. Use a semi gloss latex paint in black. Paint it on and rub it in and wipe of excess going in the direction of the wood grain with a soft rag.    2. Use a minwax gel stain or water based stain in Ebony. Use a paint brush to apply the stain and a staining pad to drag off the excess.  the more coats you use the darker it get. The wood grain and original color will peek through a little for a weathered look.  If you can get a piece of scrap wood, do do and try these techniques out before you start on the furniture.
7igxiGrAaa	The best weekend for garage sales is Memorial Day Weekend. Start it Saturday and go till Sunday. You can add Monday in if you want but most people are set on their ways to parties and barbeques on Monday. This weekend is excellent because the weather is nice and warm and people will be out and about. Many people have 3-day weekends and travel so there will be more people in your area that usual.  We've always had the best success on this weekend.   4th of July weekend isn't bad either.|`|h1OSKOLsaa	Most people that look for garage sales (junkers), are usually out by 7:00 in the morning.

y31mee4Faa	Nothing wrong with your English...    Look on the can/bottle & see what solvent was used to make it.  You should find something like acetone, hexane, heptane, benzene or possibly something else.    After you've determined what the solvent is, call some art supply stores & see if they carry that solvent.    The solvents in rubber cements evaporate very rapidly, so you should keep the lid tightly closed until ready to use, then put the lid back on tight.      Good luck...|`|gFHTcIc8aa	Throw it out buy a new bottle.  Once rubber cement has "cured"  or "hardened" it's unusable.    Edit:  You can usually use rubber cement when somewhat stiff but not rockhard. I'm assuming the rubber cement you have is rockhard. As far as trying to "soften" ruber cement it's much safer and easier to throw out bottle & spend another $2 to buy another.    ******CAUTION******  IMHO: Unless you're somewhat familar and comfortable with handling toxic solvents and understand which solvents are compatible with your bottle of rubber cement, I would not go any further.  Note that the solvents that you would need to soften rubber cement are at the very least toxic to skin as well as being very flammable.        .|`|4mwVxvLOaa	nail polish remover    call the inc    buy new cement|`|K97esxDsaa	I'm fairly sure acetone (nail polish remover) is similar to the solvent used in rubber cement. You might try putting a small amount in the container and seeing if that thins it back out.
y31mee4Faa	Not sure what you mean by bumpy, but if the tiles were not laid level, grout is not going to cure the problem.    When adding thin layers of grout, you will need to carefully paint the existing grout lines with a latex bonding agent & mix some of the bonding agent into the grout mix, in place of water.    Only paint the bonding agent where you will be adding more grout & let it get tacky before applying the grout...best to practice first so your grout or bonding agent doesn't dry out too much.    If this new application runs to a feathered edge, the new grout may flake out later.      Good luck...
AA10097817	Rubbing alcohol and a clean white cloth.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I use my carpet shampoo machine; it has an attachment for furniture.  Then after I shampoo, I either take the cushions out in the sunshine and fresh air to finish drying (they are just damp) or pop them in my dryer for a spin and a fluff with a couple of clean tennis balls.      Regular vacuuming of furniture helps a lot and treat spots as you find them.  In most cases, a cloth dampened with a little clean dish water will take any spots away.  And sending the cushions for a spin in the dryer does kill dust mites if that is a concern.  You need to leave them in there for about 1/2 hour.  I usually put in a damp towel to attract the dust/loose dirt that might come out and add a fabric softener sheet to keep static from building up.|`|qouUjd7Raa	Recommend that you rent a THERMAX CARPET AND UPHOLSTERY cleaner. Rental ranges from 12dollars to 25 dollars depending on the amount of time you need to clean the upholstery.

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	My Darling, to keep my whites nice and bright, I NEVER, EVER mix them with other colors, no matter how tempted I may be to throw the light green top in, instead of waiting for a full load of colors, I go ahead and WAIT!  That little light green top, will leave behind fibers that will dinge up your whites over time.  Sometimes, though, it seems no matter what I have done, the whites start to look a bit dingey, despite my best efforts, so I have a few tricks up my sleeve to bring on the white and lose the minge dinges.  These are my tried and true ones:  1.  First line of defense is the Oxy-Clean.  Nice HOT water, a scoop or two of OXY-CLEAN and let the cycle begin.  Once it has started and mixed thoroughly.  Then I turn the set off, and wait about an hour, come back in and let it complete the cycle.  This usually brings the whites up a notch!  2.  I wait for a nice SUNNY SUNNY day and hang my whites after washing in the bright sunshine and let them just air dry in the breeze.  This brings on lots of whiteness!  3.  I DO NOT use fabric softeners as they tend to really make clothes turn yellow and dingy pretty quick.  4.  I add a cup of vinegar to the rinse water for a more complete and clean rinse and it also add softness without the "dingies".  5.  I add BLUING to the water, like Mrs. Stewarts BLUING.  You can find it online and in some stores like Target and Krogers.  6.  As a last resort, I will do bleach, not so much because I don't like it, but I do try and keep it green, but if it isn't coming clean, green is MEAN!  I will fill the tub with HOT WATER, make sure the clothes are totally wet, soap is completely mixed in, then add like a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of bleach and allow it to mix and then stop the load and wait like an hour or so and resume the load as usual.  If you can combine the bleach with an air dry in the sunshine, you should see magic happen with the white and bright!  I hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Wash your white clothes separately from your colors, and use a detergent specifically for whites. If your washer has a compartment for bleach, you can add a bit to the load now and then.|`|56d5ca1c1074ee0bc37bc6dbdb7e274baa	If you always wash whites alone, and make sure you rinse well, and dry in the sun, they should stay lovely and white. If they do look a little dingy, you can soap in a nappy whitener. This works great, and is not harsh on your clothes.|`|Su0O55W8aa	Clorox for colors on the colors and regular clorox for whites.|`|AA10520442	I wash my whites every time I wear them.  Leaving them sitting in the hamper leads to dinginess because the oils,sweat and salts from your deo start staining the fabric.

JvywwyWBaa	A bathroom should have daily attention to toilet, seat, sink and counter top.   And immediate attention to the shower/bathtub after each use.  Deep clean weekly, at least.    I use a clorox wipe on the sink and counter, and another one on the seat and top edge of the toilet. A squirt of TB cleaner, and a quick swish, and we are good to go for another day.  I like Arm and Hammer Scrub Free with Oxi-clean on the shower/tub.  I have fiberglass.  I spray it down every morning.  On deep cleaning day, I also use a nylon scrubbie.  If you have kids, or live with a man, check the front of the toilet bowl for misses daily.  Get them last with the TB wipie.    Good Luck|`|AA10097817	This is how I clean my bathroom. Part of it is a daily 5 minute routine. Keeps everything under control.    Tuesday night - spray down tub/shower, sink and toilet with Lysol/water in a spray bottle.    Wednesday morning - take shower. Before getting dressed or drying hair, climb back in tub/shower to dry the tub/shower with a towel designated for that purpose. Keeping the tub/shower dry keeps the mold away, so do it every time you use the tub/shower. Because I sprayed with Lysol/water the night before, all surfaces were sanitized overnight as it dried.    Every day, swish the toilet with a toilet brush kept in a container with Lysol. Swipe the toilet surfaces with a damp cloth designated for that purpose. Swipe the sink dry every time you use it.    Once a week vacuum and mop (or wipe down on your hands and knees with a cloth if the floor area is small). You can use the Lysol/water spray for this, but I use vinegar/water spray on my tile floors.    Most of this is a daily routine. Only a couple of things are done as weekly cleaning.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	I clean my bathroom once a week. But it is only my husband and me in the house and my husband is hardly ever here.

It's much more versatile than the floor mop.  I use it to clean my gas grill, stove, range hood, counters, cupboards, floors, windows, bathrooms, to strip wallpaper, defrost my freezer, pretty much anything.  It does windows better than any window cleaner providing you use the microfiber cloths with it.  They wipe up better than any "rag" or paper towel even thought about.  And when the cloths get dirty, ya pop them in the washer and dryer and they're good to go again.  A roll of paper towels probably lasts me a month now; better on the budget and the environment!  I don't buy all those assorted cleaners and don't have the fumes,smells and scents to deal with either.      I got a Shark model and I've very happy with it.  Just remember when cleaning with steam, you have to let the steam do the work.  You don't have to scrub, just keep steaming and the steam will lift the dirt so you can wipe it away.  I think that was the hardest thing for me to adjust to; I was so used to having to scrub everything to get the stuff off!|`|3QYwZRrmaa	i got one and its great, it gets the job done faster and its easier    answer mine aswel please  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|AA10097817	I have a steam cleaner.

Clean the whole carpet with a rented machine, or hire a professional.|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	My floors are shiny and clean! I don't know about the germ killing aspects of the thing, but I bought a Shark steam mop and it came with a little Shark steam cleaner. And it may not get hot enough to kill all the germs, but it sure leaves a lot of clean in its wake! I use it to clean my living room and dining room windows, from the storms to the actual original windows on my 1930 brick craftsman house. The windows came CLEAN like no other time I have washed them in the 9 years I have owned it, and certainly never this clean before. The light that comes through now, is streak free, clear and really nice. Made the windows look so great, EVERYONE was commenting about how different they looked! Did I change the drapes? Nope! Did I add something new? Nope! Just simply cleaned them with the steam cleaner. It got all kinds of grunge off the windows and the sills, that I didn't even know was there. It doesn't work quite like they show you on TV, but still, when you see the clean, you don't really care if they puffed a bit! I have wood floors in the dining room, living room, stairs, hallway and bedrooms. The kitchen and butlers pantry have linoleum floors. It breezes through them with no cleaners, although once in a while, because I have dogs and they will potty on the floor, given half a chance, or throw up something that didn't agree with them. I just whip out the steam mop, wipe up the big stuff with a paper towel and then maybe spritz a cleaner that smells good and steam right over it. Cleans whatever is left over and leaves a nice scent behind, instead of puke or pee. Then I drop the pad into the laundry and run it through the next load, its ready to go again and again. I NEVER dry the pad in the dryer, I simply put a fresh one back on the steam mop. It only takes about 30 seconds to a minute to go from cold to being able to steam mop. I use a micro fiber cloth, maybe a cleaner and then steam off and wipe, I have removed gunk from a REALLY OLD linoleum floor that I thought I'd have to replace, grunge from windows, dried on food and guess what I am from cabinets and baseboards, and steamed some wrinkles from a shirt with the steam cleaner. Personally, its the best $80 I have spent in some time! I have given up my wet mops, swiffer dust mop, the dust mop and the half dozen buckets of dirty water I went through in a week of mopping. Is it germ free when I am done? I really don't think it is, as the temp, while hot enough to clean, would probably melt stuff or destroy things if it actually got to higher temps that are needed for actual germ killing. I also remember in a science class (a 100 years ago) that to kill germs, you needed to reach boiling temps for 10 minutes. I know for canning you need the higher temps longer for this same purpose, so unless you want to STAND there for 10 minutes on one spot, I would say NO germ killing to 99%, but maybe enough to keep the baby somewhat safe. One way to be sure of germ killing, is to maybe use a capful of bleach to the water? But I would be really careful inhaling THAT steam! But I can tell you this, it has reduced the need for many cleaners, and certainly the ones that are toxic and dangerous. I use my basics, like bleach, Mr. Clean with Febreeze, baking soda, borax, Greased Lightening, vinegar.  With Steam mop, I have reduced my need for even the basics.  I think the best part of it, is you can see nothing is left behind, no chemicals for baby or you to inhale!  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I have one & I really like it I have the H20 steam mop.

8wymR7UGaa	hi katydid    yes you can paint your tiles and it is not that tough to do i paint tiles all of the time around tubs and showers and they look great for years. first of all give them a bit of a sand. maybe some 100 grit sand paper. then clean with TSP and water, rinse and allow to dry. then apply 1 - 2 coats of an alkyd primer undercoater then apply 1 - 2 coats of an alkyd porch and floor enamel. if you want you can get the primer and finish coat tinted and use it as an accent. always allow ample drying time and give a light sand between coats. this will give last for years and i bet you will forget about even changing the tiles after you are done.. if you want your counter can also be done this way just don't prepare any food on it, use a cutting board.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Absolutely, and it will look really pretty, try home depot or Lowe's, hope ur an artists or know one, ah wait they have stencils.

You can scrape the grout out all around the 8 tiles all the way to the wall. They sell a cheap tool at the tile store to do it. Once you have all the grout out break the tiles with a hammer. Then pry the pieces out with a screw driver. Pick out 8 new tiles in a color that you love. They sell small containers of adhesive/grout (all in one). Use it on the back of each tile and fit them into the spaces. You can fill the areas around the tile using a putty knife. Use a sponge to remove the excess. Voila, you are done and it will look great.|`|62jRmIrBaa	Don't paint! chip out the offensive tiles scrape adhesive used and replace with tiles you like of the same size and thickness.

It is true that the finer the teeth (More teeth per inch) give a smoother cut but the rule of thumb when cutting steel is three teeth should contact the steel at any one time to prevent clogging the teeth and reducing the chance of the blade over-heating and loosing it's temper (Hardness).    8 teeth per inch is a little too coarse, 10 teeth per in to 14 teeth per in would be optimal for cutting speed.    Definitely wear googles whenever cutting any metal.  Also it is a good idea to wear hearing protection as the noise is higher frequency and likely over 85 decibals which is the safe threshold for noise.    Good Luck|`|3W18HDxxaa	a metal shear or a hack saw
YiY9Yd2Jaa	Regardless of the comment from some others here, reflective foil is a very efficient way to insulate. I spent many years living on a ketch and it gets very hot below decks in the tropics, but once I did the same thing, cover all glass with reflective foil, the temperature dropped quite dramatically.     You husband sound quite innovative. You might want to consider canvas exterior blinds to make the foil less obvious and further improve the heat reducing properties of your home.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	L-O-L!!!!    HAHAHAHAH!!!    OK, this question made me laugh out loud, literally!  Thank you for that  :-)    Anyway, let me just say this much...  anyone passing by and seeing your windows covered in aluminum foil will have a similar reaction; unless, of course, they are the type to ALSO cover their windows with foil.    I can't imagine your husband would be very open to alternatives, because if he were, he'd surely never put foil over your windows in the first place.  But for starters, there are any number of highly reflective blinds you can get which will be not only private and cooling but aesthetic as well.  There are also a number of low-transmission films you can get for the windows or, better yet, low-e glass.    Anything is better than tin foil on the windows - which is worse than a wire coat hanger for a car antenna or duct tape to cover holes in your sofa!    No to mention you can't see OUT either...    Thanks again for the laugh  :-)|`|aDElEo4Xaa	some bed sheets|`|mbSZpgw8aa	Black out curtains.|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	Not sure where you live but I used to live in Colorado and there is a plastic film thing that you can use instead of foil.|`|6DxHPVohaa	I live in south Texas where the damn son comes up at 7 am and will heat up your house right away.and foil is so trashy so on the windows that i never open..i use Black plastic..from the out side you cant see it..and if you never open your curtains on that window..then your curtain will hide it...it really works...and you can sleep past 7am|`|1rlFqcVbaa	Some cheaper curtains (Walmart has some very cheap curtains) or you could buy some material and sew some curtains yourself.

It hangs down like a regular blind and comes with clips to raise and lower the blinds.

oIRLs6Spaa	Venus Fly Traps should be dormant in the winter and they should not be fed. In fact, you really never need to feed a venus fly trap. They get all the nutrition they need from the sun. They are green, which means they have chlorophyll and can photosynthesize. Anything that they can catch on their own is fine for them to eat. Obviously there aren't any bugs out in the winter, so that means that they don't need to eat. Think about where they are native to (Wilmington, North Carolina) and try to mimic the growing conditions there. In winter, there aren't bugs out, so obviously the plants won't be eating.    Assuming you live in the northern hemisphere, your plant should be dormant right now. During dormancy, they don't need much water. Just enough to keep the soil moist, but not wet. When they are growing in the spring, summer and early fall, they need a lot of water. I use the tray method where I set the pot in a tray with 1 to 2 inches of water and refill the tray as needed to keep the water level stationary.    In case you are new to growing Venus Flytraps, I will give you some basic tips. There are really only 4 things Venus Fly Traps require to stay healthy:  1) Sunlight - at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day  2) Water - rain, distilled or reverse osmosis water only  3) Soil - Nutrient poor soil such as peat moss  4) Dormancy - Venus Fly Traps require a 3-4 month dormancy period    Venus fly traps like lots of light. Try to give it at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. The more you can give it the better. It is best to grow your fly trap outside where it can get plenty of sun and catch its own food. You don't actually have to feed a Venus Fly Trap anything other than sunlight and water. If you do choose to feed it, don't over do it. Feed it only insects and at most only a couple a month.    Venus fly traps need clean water. Usually tap water will not do. It is best to use distilled water, rain water, or reverse osmosis water. Venus fly traps need water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) measurement of 50 ppm (parts per million) or less. In order to get this, you probably need to use distilled water or reverse osmosis water or rain water. Their soil should be kept wet at all times except during the winter when it should be just moist. It is best to use a tray and set the plant in an inch or two of water.    If you need to repot, for soil you can use a combination of peat moss and perlite. Most growers use a 50:50 mix of peat moss and perlite. I have been leaning toward using pure peat moss lately. Venus Fly Traps aren't picky, but be sure to use some form of peat moss or sphagnum peat moss with perlite or vermiculite to ensure that the media is nutrient poor.    Without a dormancy period, your plant's health will start to decline and it will eventually die. You should definitely put your trap into dormancy next fall.  You can read more about dormancy here:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-tra...    If you have any more questions, you can join the forum on my site and ask them there:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/|`|WcudvcLxaa	i agree with robert s  just put some trash or raw meat next to ur plant and it will catch the fly    good luck!|`|UmBAjLE3aa	Keep a banana peal out for a few days.

AA10725997	I would say the price is fair if it is from a reputable plumbing contractor.  I don't know your area but from where I am that is what I would expect to pay and or charge.    With the change in size there will be a reconfiguration needed. Adding the recirculation will add time as well. There will be some copper and fittings as well. Not to mention the vent reconfiguration    A normal change out runs a out $ 350.00 The extra $ 125.00 seems fair to me.|`|cSwMlSSUaa	I would charge you more than $475 to install a 80 Gallon water heater. id do it if i were you.|`|6DxHPVohaa	if you are buying the heater then thats way to much...ask around...call relatives..ask neighbors..then get in the phone book and call 12 then make a decision...its not hard can be done in 30 mins.the hardest part is getting the old one out it weights a ton...and ask if they take it with them...the old one.|`|NvXbH88raa	good deal!

I bet not!|`|BUPiXrxVaa	If you are buying the hot water tank, it should be about half that price for installation.    Maybe it's because it's a hot water heater. Most folks use a cold water heater. If the water is hot what's the point of heating it.|`|5feee65246b1bdb16ac518b47ab461a4aa	Do you have electric or gas?  That may be a reason for the price.        RE on answer:  It may be easy to remove it if it has unions on the cold and hot water pipes.  If not, you need to solder and it can be difficult if you never did it before.  If it's gas, you need to make sure that you have no gas leaks.  The electric is fairly simple to do, just make sure that the breaker or fuse is turned off.|`|fyWGMB9caa	if that includes the circulator you are getting a fair price

fCF02V87aa	Those two appliances pull way to many amps to be on the same circuit. Chances are you have a tripped breaker or blown fuse. Check your panel and try to reset so you can at least get your hot water back for now. You will need to have your electrician add another circuit and separate those two items.|`|cdb7510f11b08036cfff90d2a8e22235aa	Maybe you tripped the circuit breaker or fuse.    check the fuse box|`|BUPiXrxVaa	Why, because your guardian angel is looking out for you and trying to prevent a house fire.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	It sounds like the breaker tripped because both were trying to work at the same time. You're going to have to decide which one you need most and turn down the thermostat of that unit or at the very least turn the thermostat down on both units so they don't draw as much current and trip the breaker again. To reset the breaker, turn it all the way off then turn it back on, it helps to turn off one or both of the units first. Good luck to you.|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	They should not be on the same circuit.  This must be corrected.  Try turning off both items.  Reset circuit breaker.  Turn on dryer and see if it works, then turn off.  Now turn on water heater and see what happens.  If the circuit breaker trips with the water heater you probably have a shorted heating element. If the dryer trips the breaker just don't use it until you can get it serviced.|`|OUcQjqI0aa	you're going to have to wait until monday.  both appliances need to be on their own dedicated circuit.    get an electrician to test your breaker box and run new wire.    if your house is really old, you may need to have it re-wired completely.    dryers run on their own 30 amp circuit  water heaters also run on their own 30 amp circuit. these cannot be shared.    if you are not careful, you can end up burning your house down.|`|4zP4Owlgaa	Fuse must be gone. If it's a circuit breaker, just reset it. If it's a fuse, then pull it out and check continuity to see if it's blown. If so, off to the hardware with the fuse to find a replacement.   Don't do any of this if you aren't aware of the hazards of electricity: it can kill.  Where I come from, those two items need their own circuits.|`|z5BrAz4Faa	The circuit breaker in the breaker box is more than likely bad. You could look at it and make sure the wires aren't burned off and that the breaker is latching to the on. Without a volt meater it would be hard to say exactly what is wrong. 90% chance your breaker is bad.|`|3j87v4sWaa	both appliances need to be on a dedicated circuit. if both run at the same time, the breaker will overload and trip off. its a simple fix if there is an open space on the breaker panel. however, i do not recommend attempting this if you don't have electrical experience (high voltage kills!!) my best advice... wait till monday, or call a friend/neighbor to add another breaker.   good luck and be safe...|`|5feee65246b1bdb16ac518b47ab461a4aa	First of all, how long have you been in your house and is this the first time that this has happened?  If they are both on the same circuit, you can only have one on at one time.  This will be hard since you never know when the water heater will go on.  Second, both of these need to be on dedicated (single) circuits.  The water heater should be on a 30 amp two pole breaker and the dryer should be on a 30 amp breaker also.  Please have this checked as soon as!!!  I would also no run the dryer as the hot water is more important.  Check to see if the breaker is tripped.  he breaker will be in the middle position.  Just turn it off and then turn on.  Good luck!|`|NvXbH88raa	Probably tripped the breaker. As has already been stated the water heater and dryer each need their own circuit. Turn the dryer off and leave it off.Unplug the Dryer. now see if the breaker will reset. if it will leave the dryer unplugged untill you can get an Electrician in to check it out.This way you will have hot water.  If the breaker trips with only the water heater on.   Leave it off do not try to reset! Get an Electrician to check it out.
ePVQmhxgaa	Get off the computer and get started!!!!    I find starting to be the hardest part. :P|`|H4pqDG09aa	pick everything up that shouldn't be out. Tidy up, such as fluff pillows, pick up toys, news papers, magazines etc. Then wipe counters down, load dishes, anything noticeable that is out should be picked up. It's sad to say but there isn't a really fast way. But, the one thing that really is noticeable are things that are not picked up.  To clean bathrooms, get a damp older rag and wipe everything down and dry with paper towels. Not disinfected but it looks clean, the same goes for the kitchen as well- wipe-then dry.|`|vptnBsy1aa	Start with the messiest room first so it will really look like you've accomlished something! Put everything that stays in that room in it's place, if it doesn't belong in the room - put it in the room it belongs in (just set it in the room, you don't have to put it away right now) . Once you get the first room cleaned, move to the next room and do the same thing. When you focus on one room at a time, you'll get it done quicker and the progress you see makes you feel like you accomplished something!

fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	Sounds like it is properly grounded. The very early Romex cable used to be covered in a fabric weave, but it might not have had a ground wire. BX also had fabric covered rubber wires when it was first made. Since your tester read "correct", and you grounded the wire to the box, I am almost sure the cable is early BX.     When the BX is installed, the electrician puts a small cup like insulator called a "cherry", (because it is red), where the metal cable enters the metal box. That is to prevent the wires from shorting out in the event he nicks or cuts into the insulated wire. Seeing that red insulator is proof positive that the cable is BX.|`|3W18HDxxaa	yes   its grounded to the out let box|`|52e654eabf1bcef75fcacc45bc4305a0aa	Yes, it sounds like you have grounded the outlet.  The old romex had no ground wire in them. Then in the Fifties they added a ground wire. When they installed the wires they wrapped the ground wire around the end of the romex and tightened down the clamp. The clamp grounds the box to the ground wire.  So as long as the clamp is tight it is grounded.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	It might be a case of the moisture from inside the house migrating through the wall and condensing on the vinyl siding.  Get some kind of access hole on the inside of the house wall to look for a 'vapor barrier' material.

AseJ6Y13aa	Sounds like your ignition is not being fed the power to work so you will have to trace the problem back to the circuit board. Make sure that the furnace is wired up properly. I suggest calling a local HVAC service company and having them come out. It dose not cost to much and you can learn allot from them for the future problems you might have.
AA10604735	Just off the top of my head, I would say the closest to that "look" would be Chorisia speciosa the Silk Floss Tree, and the several different types of Tabebuia like T. impetiginosa.  There are probably others.  I guess Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) in its native haunts would give you that feel.  But if you irrigate Jacaranda it will never loses all its leaves, and in turn it will never be covered with flowers either.  It will only piddle out a few flowers here and there. In the tropics, what you need to look for is a tree that loses its leaves during the dry season (called "winter" some places but not a real winter like in the temperate zone) and then tends to bloom all over before it ever leafs back out.  Two other suggestions since you may be in a an in-between area: Evergreen Pear, Pyrus kawakami, will never loose all its leaves but does have a cherry-looking white blossom since it is closely related.  Taiwan Flowering Cherry, Prunus campanulata is a true ornamental cherry that does not require a typical winter chill to bloom. Spectacular.  Look these all up as an image search on Yahoo! and rejoice.  I envy you for being able to plant and enjoy them where you live.  No temperate-zone cherry can compare, IMHO.
ec2dc5211c53f8480f101ad72a7e1eb4aa	You are talking about "waterless cookware".     If these were better than standard cookware, chefs and restaurants would use them. They do NOT.     Be wary of product that has in home demonstrations.     Most stainless pans are made of "poreless" high quality steel. All Clad, Calphalon, Ramesy, Henckels, etc.     Waterless cookware is a scam. these pans are hard to cook in, do not live up to the hype, and are outrageously expensive. There are thousands of complaints about their bait and switch sales. You end up paying 3 times as much as you think you will.     If these pans were so great, you'd be able to go to your local department store and buy them.    heating the pan all over will NOT overcook the surface of the food. It's the cook himself who overcooks food by turning the heat too high or leaving it on too long.     It's a total scam.

Next, half fill a bowl with hot, soapy water (pure soap flakes like Lux are best) then immerse the black parts of the shirt into that, holding the cuffs and collar out of the water. With one hand swish the shirt vigorously, squeezing the soapy water hard under the armpits. Empty the hot water, fill the basin with cold water and manually rinse three times. You will find that the white bits can go in without turning grey if you do the rinsing quickly. Hang on a coathanger with the cuffs pegged up beside the collar - put on a line outside to drip dry if the weather is fit. Otherwise squeeze all excess water out and hang over the bath, or above a radiator indoors. Clearly the washing machine doesn't come into any of this! From experience, I would say the whole process won't take you more than 5 minutes.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	I would take the collar and cuffs off and reattach with velcro ... problem solved.  That's what I used to do when I sewed a lot.  Otherwise, it's a tough call.  <br>  <br>  You could always take it to a dry cleaners but that isn't always a sure thing either.  I worked at a One Hour Martinizing Dry Cleaner for a few years.
vk6sczbLaa	Use the same hooks. Just match up all the holes and hook it to a single rod. Then have the liner fall in the tub, and the decorative curtain outside the tub. That's how I have it set up.    I want to say the packaging will tell you how many holes are in the curtain, so make sure that the two you get are the same size. I have a standard sized shower/tub, so for the size of curtains I needed I use 12 hooks.|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	They use the same curtain rings.  You just buy a package of rings.  I think it is a standard number.  The liner hangs INSIDE the tub and the decorative curtain hangs OUTSIDE the tub.|`|285cdf0f42a5ad1b82e6756c69e8c768aa	They can both go on the same hooks, you will need 12 hooks. Also, so you will not need to replace the liner all the time, a tip I learned from my Mom --- every once in a while, wash the shower curtain, and the liner with a load of bath towels on cold water (gentle or normal)  The motion of the towels washing in the machine will help "wash" the shower curtain and liner. You can also occasionally wash the rubber bath tub bath mat with bath towels as well.   Hope this helps you. Take care.|`|9a9bc3fcd75b9c1aaf0f67c0fead9c6caa	You can hang them together. Just make sure the liner stays inside the tub.    Most shower curtains have 12 holes, so you should need 12 hooks.  Count the holes in the curtain to make sure.

f1beDbKIaa	My freezers (I have more than one fridge) do not have lights.  I assume it's because when you turn on the light, the bulb changes temperature wildly, and again when you turn it off.  That's got to be tough on the bulb.  One solution might be to use LED lights, which now come in white.  And, they use less power for an amount of light, so they don't get so hot.  That would make them more efficient.    Of course, it could have to do with the issue of having frost all over them.|`|TvkR2ftsaa	I believe that you, sir, need a new freezer!|`|PgQui4jNaa	I have often wondered the same thing!

That is a darn good question! I agree with both the answer about bulb shock and the LED answer. My guess is, however, that the freezer is such a small space and usually at eye level so the ambient light (from an overhead kitchen light) would make the freezer light redundant.|`|QPWjtDzcaa	I had never seen a light bulb in a freezer, until I purchased my first house in 2004.  It was just a standard, 60 watt incandescent bulb, that turns on when I open the door, and turns off when I close it (same mechanism in the refrigerator.)  Every appliance in the kitchen was "brand spankin new" when I bouth the home, so I assumed that, well, someone at Kenmore was thinking the thought you had at some point in time.      The bulb works fine, and I have only had to replace it once, although, that *is* one more time than I've had to replace the refrigerator bulb.  I think Suitti might be on to something with the extreme temperatures.  Living in Minnesota, we have extreme changes in temperature from season to season (heck, sometimes in short periods of time too, it's 45 degrees warmer now than it was 40 hours ago).  There does seem to be a correlation to how often I change my outdoor bulbs vs. my indoor ones, where the temperature is relatively consistent.  And I use my indoor lights more frequently.  Whether there is a real connection between temperature extremes and the lifespan of a bulb, I am not certain, but from experience, it certainly appears to be so.    The only information I have been able to find relating to coldness and lihgtbulbs is a "resistence correlation" on wiki:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescen...    I don't think that really answers the question a great deal.  Maybe you'd get better answers asking in the physics category, or possibly (this might be a stretch) one of the electronics ones.
AA10895799	IKEA's stuff is stylish and innovative.  I love going to the store and would not leave my child there unless I knew someone working there at the same time I would be there!  U can get great ideas going to the store and by getting a catalog.  The sofas are a great bargain!  We have 2. One in the den. We bought 2 slipcovers so we have new sofas this year!  They have things of varying quality.  Cheap stainless steel flatware that will rust or the very heavy, much more expensive flatware that won't..  Shelves are great.  U have to use yr head and check it out .  Go there before going to another furniture store.  Frankly, I would go there and then go to a day of thrift store shopping.  U can't beat the prices on the furniture, tho'.  The linens aren't that great. There are loads of plastic and steel items that U need to complete a house that are cheap and good quality at IKEA, so go.|`|nOVSf06Raa	if you have the money buy yourself one good piece at the time , it will last you for years to come unless you are the type of person that like to change furniture often ,this store is convenient for students and people that move a lot , you are the only one that can really decide on it when you go and see what they have it's a shopping trip worth taking ,I have never been personally but I have hear others talking about it and they said the same thing that I just told you .|`|AA10250756	You are much better off finding sturdy used furniture on www.craigslist.org or through your newspaper. The IKEA stuff does fall apart. It looks good for a few years, but there is much more durable stuff. You can also check out the stuff at your local staples or office depot. It's a lot more convenient, but like I said I got stuff through the newspaper and craigslist that was made of real wood and I still have it years later.|`|YbnMcP9yaa	Just like all stores, it will depend on what you buy. I feel the sofas are pricey for what they are. I am personally not a fan of putting my things together (most things).|`|NNTPnhZgaa	I don't know where you're from, but if you're going to the IKEA in Atlanta, you know as well as I do that it's just one big headache.  Their stuff falls apart.  Seriously.  Nothing there is good.  Not even their childcare.  Their furniture is horrible.  The prices seem amazing but you get what you pay for.  I bought a box of cookies there once & those weren't even good.  The only thing I enjoy about that store is their cafe, haha.|`|Ez5ZhYofaa	id say that it really depends on what your buying,  some things are expensive but i recon most of the things are good quality,  i dont think i have ever baught something from IKEA that wasnt good quality,  and most of the things there are very handy.  in my opinion id say you should shop there.  its even great for your kids if you have any, because theres a playground and lots of things kids would like to play with,   so i recon yes you should shop there.

AA10378604	well, the lint is moist because the dryer was trying to push the wet air out through the vent, it sounds like you have a buildup of lint in your vent that needs to be removed in order for your dryer to work. You should try to clean the vent all the way through. Then, try starting the dryer with the vent disconnected and make sure that you have enough air flow there. If it is gas, it will be fine as long as you don't leave it on. This may also make a mess so be prepared.|`|AA10409603	is your washer spin drying the clothes enough?? sounds like your clothes are still way too dry to go into the dryer!!  and stackables are for smaller loads than the floor models,, do not over fill it|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	That vent pipe has to be cleaned out.

wMijB5Bmaa	As for building the pond itself, several companies sell manufactured plastic ponds.  All you have to do for these is dig a hole and drop it in.  From there you can pretty it up by dropping rocks or plants around it.<br>  <br>  The home of a Comet goldfish should contain densely planted regions as well as big open areas where the Comet goldfish can swim around without being entangled in aquatic plants.

This works with a float like in a watering tank on a farm.
EXpaRBsyaa	The Bernina 707 is one of the best 3/4 size machines made.  It is a very reliable workhorse of a machine and still holds all or nearly all of its' original value.  Truly a desirable machine.  Now...as to the reason the machine doesn't operate correctly:  On the inside center of the hand wheel you will find a ridged knob.  This knob locks and releases the handwheel to the main shaft, allowing you to wind the bobbin without the needle going up and down.  If you turn this small knob away from you, it will tighten and the machine will run properly.  If you turn it towards you, it will release the main shaft and you will have what you now have...the handwheel will turn but the machine won't sew.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Sounds like the belt is shot or the drive gear has come disengaged for some reason.

Don't change your cabinet, just change the doors to match the counter top. Once the doors are removed, many people paint both the outside and inside of the cabinet case, a neutral color or in some instances, match the kitchen etc. But, we have found that a good quality door, matching the counter top, will make the entire project look better than one might expect because the first thing everyone sees is the cabinet door.

We decided to get new cabinet doors from Lowe's (from "Quality Doors" in Texas) and we picked a red oak, unfinished. We made the woods match pretty well. And we added crown moulding at the top so now you really don't see that much of the old cabinets.    I think LOTS of wood finishes look nice with black granite. I would go with medium to dark tones, like cherry. Personally, I think white or very light cabinets look too stark with black counters.|`|ElBaODCCaa	Buying all new granite would be a very big expense.  Find out what type of wood your cabinets are.

N4IvZmPiaa	A lot of people will give me grief for saying this, but really any of those portable heaters are designed and fall under the category of a construction heater in the gas handling codes. They were never meant to heat any part of a living area while people are inhabiting it. That being said...I know everyone uses them in ice fishing huts, garages, sheds and homes in a pinch. Just remember that these are unvented heaters. They are using up the air that you breathe, and they are putting products of combustion into that air.    The rule of thumb that we use is 1 square inch of fresh air supply for every 1000 btu's. So if it's a 20,000btu heater you need a 2 inch by 10 inch opening to provide adequate combustion air, and ventilation for the spent gases. I would recommend opening a window slightly at each end of the area where you use it. As I said above, everyone uses these things...but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you have this running while anyone is sleeping in there! These units can easily start to produce carbon monoxide if the air supply is not adequate or the fuel runs low. Also carbon monoxide detectors are an absolute must have!     Read and follow the manufacturers instructions to the letter! Especially the parts about clearance from combustibles and ventillation.|`|4mwVxvLOaa	open ventalation & conect a pipe to that thing & buy a top to get co2 &c3m out of your house|`|AA11275863	DO NOT TAKE A PROPANE TANK INTO THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	You need to be aware of carbon monoxide that these put off. You really need to have some good ventilation in the house which would likely defeat the purpose of the heater in the first place. Best of luck to you and may your power be restored very soon.|`|AA10263113	It depends on what model you have. Do a search on      reddy heaters propane  and look for your model. With proper venting it may be ok, but CO is very dangerous.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	If you are going to monitor it constantly and keep it at least 10 to 15 feet away from anything combustible, including the floor covering, you may be able to heat one room.    My question is, in your question you said Ice storm, does that mean you don't have power? A propane ready heater needs power also, not just propane.

It;s not that hard if U R handy and if U R not, just read about it and tell someone U hire what U want and show the.  It's called roughing out the room and framing it up.

AA11498082	Think this covers all of your questions: http://www.viable-herbal.com/singles/her...
AA10604735	Q:how are the growth habits, patterns different between deodor cedar and leylandi cypress?how so and why so?  A: Although these are both considered needled evergreens, and both are conifers, they are very, very different.  Leylands are much narrower in proportion to their height than are Deodars.  In other words, both grow fast but Deodars grow wide as well.  Leylands' shape tapers in a little before the lowest branches to the ground.  Deodars' natural shape is "Christmas tree", with the widest portion on the ground at the base, then tapering up toward the utmost tip. Leylands' needles are adpressed along the stems of flattish sprays, while Deodars' needles are individual, and arranged in fascicles, like pine needles, only much shorter.  Leyland's have an almost lime-green color.  Deodars are grey green, and some of the newer cultivars are almost blue like a Colorado Blue Spruce.  There is a Naylor's Blue cultivar of the Leyland Cypress available too.  Q:btw, which one is more disease, problem resistant?  A:Deodars have fewer  problems at this time.  Their worst issue is Deodar Weevils, an insect that bores holes in their trunk. Deodar Weevils may be treated if caught in time, so that they will not kill the tree.  Leylands are dying all over the place from a fungal disease call Bot.  There is no practical cure for this disease in Leylands, and the Leylands are genetically identical, unlike Deodars.  So, once Bot starts in a stand of Leylands, the whole group quickly succumbs.  Q:also, is it okay to plant deodor cedar as close as leylandi at 10 feet apart?or would they need no less than 20?  A: I would never plant Deodars closer than 20' apart, but many people in the business do it. IMO they will be sorry in just a few years.    Q:why so?  A: Cramming them too close will obscure the beautiful shape of Deodars which draws people to plant them in the first place.  Poor light and circulation of air in the sections where the trees "bump into" each other will precipitate in dead and unsightly branches which will need constant removal.  Money will have been wasted because of stupidity, impatience, or both.  PS: Deodars are about a 9 on the Classy scale and Leylands are about a 3.  The only real problem with Deodars, their spindliness, can be cured by a very light and careful pruning of about 3-4" of each of the soft outer branch tips each early March (in the N hemisphere) or September (in the S hemisphere). Start this very light pruning regimen early in their lives, and continue until they are too big to reach all the branches with a pole pruner or ladder.

nSQhVRGZaa	Hi Freedom.......screw type CFL's can be used as long as you have cool and warm alternated throughout your growing area.  You will need to surround them on short (approx 8" tall) lamps around the growing area and some in the center (depending on how many trays)  They still give the full spectrum of the sun but again - will need to be distributed evenly or the plants will lean toward the light source - and unless you want to keep turning them all the time....well, you get the picture.  As the plants get taller - you can always put books under the lamps - unless you're using a ceiling fixture - then the plants will need to be lifted up to the fixture....and lowered as they get taller.|`|KVHYXILkaa	You can buy Full Spectrum CFL's.

It generally needed a gloss floor covering wiped onto it weekly, to keep it in reasonably good order. It was made from a mixture of linseed oil and other substances bonded onto a backing such as felt or burlap. It had a tough, rubbery surface.   It was generally fastened to the floor with an adhesive. It was most commonly used in kitchens, bathrooms and playrooms.  It was also used in small pieces for block printing.  It was invented in 1860 by Frederick Walton, an Englishman.    Vinyl floor covering is the type that supersedes it. It has plastic in it, which makes it easier to care for and makes it last longer.

But never factors in the cost to produce the electricity-- and in most areas any heat provided by electricity is always higher than gas heat.

It could also be non-related to the oil, possibly a weak ignition transformer, electrodes out of adjustment, cracked electrode porcelains, etc.  Also dirty flame detector, you should call a service tech.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	If it ran dry, it probably needs a new nozzle. Probly clogged up with gunk from the bottom of the tank.|`|fyWGMB9caa	clogged filter ?|`|8e3c1da786497f2130276d9d3c413210aa	Sounds like it need servicing  nozzle,filter, strainer

FlsrXuJOaa	You don't usually want to over seed anything in a Bermuda lawn. :( It is a really aggressive grass, and even spraying it with roundup or turflon ester doesn't have much success killing it permanently. If you over seed with anything else, the Bermuda will choke it out. Also, rye and fescue are in general cool weather grasses so they won't do well in texas in the summer when it's really hot. Bermuda grass is really pretty, though. It is really thick and lush in the summer and does a good job of doing its own weed control. Hope this helps!|`|Guy3V1xkaa	go to lowes and ask the outside lawn and garden department, they sell stuff to take care of your lawn in the winter.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	You can't do anything right now, it will be a waste of money. Your bermuda will start to green up in another month or so depending on where you live in Texas, be patient. I'm a Golf Course Superintendent from Texas now living in Cancun. When it starts to green up, go to Home Depot or Lowe's and buy a bag of fertilizer. It's not critical which one, just fertilize. Any Scott's  or  Lesco fertilizer will work well for you. Textbook recommendations are 6 to 8 lbs. of Nitrogen per 1000 square feet. Depending on the size of your yard, that's about 5 to 7 bags per year. Don't overseed unless you want to mow your yard all winter.|`|IR72L8gOaa	From our location in ND, it is fine to plant grass seeds in Spring or late Fall where conditions are a lot cooler than in summer time.  The grasses we planted late last fall grew very well to our surprise!  We saw tiny plants sprouting from the ground a week after dropping seeds on the ground.  The only problem with dropping seeds rather than burying on the soil is that we had birds visiting and feasting on our grass seeds.  But we've dropped enough so the birds weren't able to eat them all.  We kept watering the ground and kept the soil moist the whole time.    If you want instant grass, I suggest getting some sods from a local landscaping business.  We've done this last Fall.  We've decided to cover part of our front yard with sods because we thought the seeds won't have enough time to grow for our open house.  You just need to keep watering the new sods at least once a day till there is new growth.  In less than two weeks, we noticed new growth and we weren't too worried about it.  Hope this helps.

If you keep it upright,  you should be able to plug it in right away.|`|AA11785060	Right away.  No reason for it to sit unless it is over 25 years old.  Newer ones can also be laid down on their sides if you have to, won't hurt a thing.  Just make sure if you do tilt or lay it down, you take out any glass shelves or any shelves for that matter, otherwise they will fall out and get messed up or break.  Once you get the refrigerator moved into its new location, if it has been basically upright all the time, even if leaned over on a 2 wheel cart, go ahead and plug it in. No need to wait on it for any reason.    Really old ones would lose their oil out of the compressor and it had to settle back down, if layed on their sides.  But new ones don't have that issue.   I sold and delivered refrigerators for several years, never had any problems.  Other than getting them through doors and up stairs!  If your doorways are too tight, do go ahead and take off the doors, will make the unit lighter and easier to handle also. Good luck.|`|f0NFwXxwaa	Hi      There really isn't a rule to work by on this situation but I understand your concern. When you buy a new fridge and have it delivered you are advised to let it settle for so long and then plug it in.     When we moved my wife defrosted the fridge and freezer and gave them a good clean out. The next day we moved in the new house plugged in and all was well.     Hope your happy in your new abode :)|`|4MxCAm6gaa	You can move it right away. The important thing is to not lay it on its side when transporting it. If you tip it too far when moving(on a dolly) you should wait a few hours before plugging it back in to be safe.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	You can move it immediately. Do not lay it completely on its side unless you absolutely have to. If you do lay it on its side, allow it at least 24 hours sitting upright before you plug it in.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	2 seconds, but if it gets tipped or laid down in moving, let it sit for a couple hours before plugging it back in.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	You can move it right away but generally once you get it to where it's going to sit you should wait 12-24 hours before plugging it back in.

2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	if this is a water heat system and you don't have a valve at the boiler to shut off or adjust the first floor then no.  The Valve is a water valve used to bleed air out of the system not for adjustment of heat.  A lot of the older systems did not put valves to bypass certain areas and just ran the water through one to the next heater.  To create a bypass it would have to have a pipe that went passed the heater with a valve that directed the water to the heater and through it or around it.
jVeEfJnkaa	I have always had great results with Mean Green cleaner that you find at the dollar stores.   spray it on directly, let sit a few minutes and scrub with a warm wet cloth.  You will probably have to repeat the process a couple times.  If that doesn't work, the stain is probably not going to come out because after sitting so long, it might have actually dyed the carpet fibers.  Good luck to you.

346c457f7a4722f6b8fbb974db297924aa	Hey Shari I did a research and found that the best grasses used in Michigan generally consist of bluegrass or bluegrass mixtures. I have included a list below.  <br>  <br>  Kentucky Bluegrass<br>  Kentucky bluegrass is the most widely used turfgrass in Michigan. With proper management, it forms a long lasting lawn, and it is an aggressive sod former. Bluegrass grows rapidly during cool, moist weather, with slower growth during hot, dry weather. When rainfall is not adequate, watering is necessary to maintain high quality. All cultivars respond well to a mowing height of 1 ? to 2 ? inches.<br>  <br>  Many cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass are available, and new selections are constantly being introduced. Cultivars may differ in color, disease resistance, vigor, and amount of care required for best performance. Unfortunately, no single cultivar provides ideal performance under every condition. Even disease resistance can change as new strains of diseases appear. <br>  <br>  Fine-leafed Fescues<br>  Fine-leafed fescues are cool season turfgrasses that are more tolerant of shade and infertile, droughty soils than Kentucky bluegrasses. The fine-leafed fescues are best adapted to dry, shady sites and will not tolerate wet, poorly drained soils. Compared to bluegrasses, fescues require minimal levels of management, including less fertilizer and water. Excessive fertilization or irrigation can cause a severe thinning of a fine-leafed fescue lawn. Leafspot diseases can also cause an extensive thinning of the lawn during midsummer. For these reasons, fine-leafed fescues are seldom grown alone, but are primarily used in mixtures with bluegrasses. Red fescue, chewings fescue and hard fescue are the three fine-leafed fescue species grown in Michigan. Red fescue is a sod former, while chewings fescue and hard fescue are bunch-type grasses. <br>  <br>  Perennial Ryegrasses<br>  Perennial ryegrasses have an erect bunch-type growth habit with rapid seed germination and establishment. Medium levels of fertility and well-drained soils are preferred. Both common and improved perennial ryegrasses are available. Common or unimproved types tend to be short-lived, due to lack of winter hardiness. These common types also have a coarse appearance and a tough fibrous leaf with poor mowing quality. Improved cultivars developed for turf use have greater winter hardiness and better mowing characteristics. Only these improved cultivars should be considered for a lawn where rapid cover and wear tolerance are required. Ryegrasses may be seeded in combination with bluegrasses to establish a lawn on sloping areas where erosion is a potential problem. <br>  <br>  Rough Bluegrass<br>  Rough bluegrass forms a light green prostrate turf that is adapted to moist, shaded conditions. It is superior to Kentucky bluegrass in establishment vigor, but will not tolerate traffic or hot, dry conditions. It does not blend well with most turfgrasses, due to its light green color. Rough bluegrass is not recommended except for wet, shaded sites where fine-leaved fescues will not persist. <br>  <br>  Turf Type, Tall Fescues<br>  A new generation of finer textured, tall fescues has been introduced. These grasses have shown to be very wear and drought tolerant. Disease and insect problems have been minimal and performance on dry, sandy sites has been very good. They will also perform well in sun and shade. Winter hardiness seems adequate in southeast Michigan, but hardiness in other areas is unknown. Tall fescues are bunch type grasses and should not be used for overseeding or mixed with other grass species. At this time, turf type, tall fescues should be used on a trial basis.|`|OQeXXvaPaa	try using a moss or a ground cover plant (and yes, I am serious)

Feet, yards, metres? It would assist greatly if you could be marginally more specific.|`|Gem96NQyaa	You're not providing enough info here.  What's the square footage per pack?  "10 in a pack" doesn't really tell us anything, because flooring comes in all kinds of sizes.<br>  <br>  Assuming you mean 15 feet by 13 feet, multiply 15 by 13 to get your total square footage needed.<br>  <br>  Then all you have to do is determine how many packs are needed to fill that area, based on the square footage per pack.|`|fynzkVK4aa	15x13=195 sq feet or 66.5 square metres.<br>  <br>  It will usually say on a pack how much square area one pack will cover.  Just divide the number above by the amount it says one pack will cover, that will be your answer in packs.<br>  <br>  E.G. If it says it covers 3m, you would divide 66.5/3 giving you an answer of 22.2 packs, so you would need to buy 23 packs to cover the whole room.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|yk7Qv1GZaa	That's 15 X 13 = 195. Now just look on the package and it will say how many square feet (or whatever you're working with) per pack. The divide 195 by what the package said. That will give you the number of packages you need.<br>  <br>  Remember though, you'll need 5%-10% more to allow for scrap.|`|60db7e648583c2d8bbd2fc79bd2f0368aa	Assuming they are 12" square,,,you will need 20 cases. That's allowing for cutting and sizing special pieces.|`|IRl2qTDuaa	it would help to know what size the flooring? is it 1 sq. foot? is it 2 sq. feet?

iZ4JugiAaa	Hang it outside on a sunny, breezy day.|`|dPk7dr7laa	Try using the at home drycleaning system you can get at Walmart in the laundry Isle. They are only about $20 to get the starter kit and then cheaper to buy the drycleaning pads without the kit after that. I have used them and they work well to get smells out. Also try putting it in the sun for a short time (not too long or you will fade the color) before using the drycleaning home kit. The sun is always good at getting rid of mold and fungus on thins. It kills them and that gets rid of the smell.

AA10389562	I never use organic mulch for vegetables.  They can contain too many pests and diseases.  I always use plastic sheeting and cut holes where the plants emerge.<br>  <br>  I water either once or twice a day depending on the temperature, early morning and late afternoon.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	I usually don't use hardwood mulch around my veggies.  Shredded newspaper or composted leaves.  But mostly because I'm a tightwad - and those things are free.<br>  <br>  I'd change that second question to how many times per WEEK, not per day.<br>  <br>  I'll water plants in containers once a week.  But plants in the garden - properly mulched - if I get a good rain once a week, they don't need extra water at all.  If there's no rain, a nice, deep soak twice a week is fine.<br>  <br>  Watering once a day says you're not watering deep enough....The water will mostly stay in the top 4 to 6 inches of soil.  That will train your plants to keep their roots near the surface - where the water is - which will make them even MORE susceptible to drought in the future.  Infrequently deep watering is much better than frequent shallow watering.|`|OQeXXvaPaa	Try lasanga gardening, it's basically cardboard, hay and yard scraps layered out and then watered for minimum watering and maximum weed protection.
