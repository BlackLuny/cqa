20090128153113AA5pUub	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Why doesn't my computer connect to the network at startup?	I work in a school where there are about 70 or more computers on the network. I have one computer that disconnects and needs to be reconnected everytime I start it up. What should I do to keep it connected like all of the others. Thanks!      The OS is Windows XP and when the computer starts up there isn't an error message. It just says it couldn't connect all the network drivers. These computers are workgroup as well as some being on a DHCP server. This particular computer has both options at login (local or domain log in). The students log in under the local user. There are other computers in the lab that have this as well and do not disconnect from the network. I'm not sure if the ip address are assigned automatically.  It is not a physical problem because I tried it in another location with a different ethernet cord and it is still the same. Thank you so much for your help!

I have Comcast high-speed internet.  I have their modem. It comes with a USB cable.  Do I need 2 USB cables to use a router/acess point?  Do I need a router OR an access point to do this?

20090128160120AA3XDfb	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is it okay to leave a laptop plugged in and on all the time?	I have an HP Pavilion Laptop, and usually turn it completely off at night. But for the past week or so, I have resorted to leaving it plugged in and completely on all the time (all night, all day). I changed the settings so the laptop doesn't go to sleep/hibernate, but the screen does go black after 5 minutes. The reason I did this was because I wanted my AIM to stay on all night, so in the morning I could quickly check it/change my away message.    Is this okay for my laptop? The ventilation is not a problem, because it is sitting on my wooden desk. But will the battery life be affected? Am I better off just turning it off? My laptop is almost a year old, and I don't want to kill it.    Thanks! :)

Is there anyway i can use my girlfriends macbook with the install disc(s) in her ROM drive and connect it via firewire to mine and run the disc(s) like that?

However, now that I'm seeing the current Vonage commercial that he talked about, it seems like they're saying that they offer Internet connection through a wireless device, (perhaps like one of those USB wireless modems, except they were offering unlimited use for something like $24.95, instead $59.99, like AT&T charges).      So I went to the Vonage web site, looking for such a service, but couldn't find it.  Does anyone know where I can find this information?      I wonder if they're confusing people on purpose, or does it simply come natural to them?

20090128171745AAwrLzh	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	My sister's computers FUKT help plz!!?	Ok, so she was running on the latest version of ESET NOD32 blah n blah, shes on an acer, which would account for alot of the shitty performance, BUT not all of it.        1)  Her internet explorer wasnt working so i tried to uninstall it.  I didnt have that option through control panel, so i tried to manually delete it.  It wouldnt let me do that (said the file was in use), so i went thru and tried to delete it file by file..  The file named internet explorer (.exe file) kept replacing itself, along with some sort of internet explorer 'quickfix' program.      2)  I uninstalled limewire (which she used as her internet browser since IE didnt work) since i was under the impression that i could put install programs that she needed on shared docs virus-free.. But then my computer disappeared from my sister's shared docs, and i couldnt access hers from mine!!!      I decided to restart her computer, and everytime i log in (even in safe mode!!!!) the computer logs me out.  I cant think of anything else to do H-E-L-P

20090128171558AAqqWuf	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why does commercial technology have to be updated every 6 months?	Why is it that every 6 months a new computer processor or new RAM or new GPU's come out? Why can't they just sit down and work for a year, make a product that they just can't currently find a way to improve that will last 2 or 3 years? Are people REALLY discovering new things that fast? Or are they just slapping on more cores for the money? I realize these companies are a business and their primary concern is making money, but can someone who knows tell me if money is why they keep bringing out new tech or is it legitimate advancements?

I'm doing a c++ program project for my low-level c++ class where I have to validate email addresses that are listed in a .txt file.  My problem is that I have no idea how to go about placing the contents of this file (i'll call it "addresses.txt") into a string in order to perform functions on it.      Preferably, I'd like to place each separate address in its own string (or maybe use the same string object to store one address, test it to see if it's valid, then replace it with the next address).  I think I would know how to do the rest if I could just figure out how to move it from the txt file to a string.  Thanks a bunch!

20090128164010AADB40m	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Looking for advice on a CPU and video card?	I'm looking for some advice about which CPU and video card to purchase for the budget HD media center/gaming rig I am currently building. I'll start off by listing what I currently have..      - Antec 300 Case   - Gigabyte EP45-UD3P Intel Crossfire Motherboard   - Corsair 650TX PSU   - WD Caviar Black 1TB HDD   - Arctic Freezer 7 Pro CPU Cooler   - Samsung 46" HDTV (46A750), for use as a monitor.      I have about $500-$600 CAD to spend on the CPU & Video card and was looking for advice on how to properly split the cost.       Currently, I am interested in the Intel Q9550 (as i heard it overclocks well) aswell as any brand of 4870 1GB (probably the coolest and quietest since it will be in my living room) but an not adverse to getting an Nvidia if the price is right. Of course, both of these do not currently fit in my budget.      So, Would it be wiser to spend more on the CPU over the GPU? Also, since I am using my 46" HDTV as my monitor, would it be better to purchase the 4870 1GB over the 512MB version (to output at 1080p)? With the recent introduction of Nvidia's GTX 295, is there any chance the 4870 1GB's drop in price? Any 4870 brand recommendations?      Also, I have the opportunity to buy hardware in the US and bring it back to Canada. Would it be worth it and would the warranty still be valid?      Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

20090128175547AAhA5Hw	Computers & Internet;Software	Should I use Limewire?	I know all about how it is illegal to download copyrighted songs and how I could get a virus, but truthfully I don't know anyone who has actually gotten caught, or even got a virus and most of my friends use it. For now I'm using Itunes, but I really want to get more music, but not spend a lot of money. I don't want to pay a subscription like rhapsody because I dont want to have to pay monthly for music, that i can't keep and do what I want with it. If anyone knows a music service that you only pay once for a lifetime subscription fee or maybe sites where they use ads to pay for music. I know about spiral frog and qtrax but they dont work for ipods. I really want to legally get music, but really if the U.S really cared about people who download illegal music, im sure they could easily shut down things like limewire, frostwire or those others. They did it with napster and that kawaza site, so why is it so hard for them to do it with the most popular ones? So what do you people think I should do?

Those are the ONLY two formats that I can record in.  I use Windows Movie Maker to edit my videos and I have changed the settings to export in 16:9, but my question is, will it upload to YouTube as widescreen? or, would I need to record in widescreen.      I can't record in HD because it's too laggy for my computer.      If you look at my videos ( http://www.youtube.com/cressferriera)  they are all not widescreen and have those black boxes.  I just recorded a video that I have not yet uploaded, I exported it in 16:9 and also exported it in high quality (large)      I hope someone out there has any answer that will help me.

I get the standard error message of "USB device not recognized", and that it has "malfunctioned", but there is actually nothing wrong with it.      It still charges when plugged in, but I can no longer transfer music or view files. It is not listed as a portable device in Computer.      It has firmware version 1.31.01e and I have Creative Mediasource 5 running on the computer. I have tried the inbuilt scandisk on the mp3 player, but don't want to reformat it in case it still doesn't work, leaving me an mp3 player with no tracks.

What started out as a seeminly good idea, has tuned into a joke! At first, I couldn't add the 'image' ads at all. Banners, leaderboards, you name it... no success...      I eventually managed to get some 'text' ads up there, tried a combination of 3 trying to find the format that worked for me (I hate those text ads and don't think anyone clicks on them at all!) I was still having major nightmares with ads not showing...       when i tried to copy and past the code of the one format that i liked ALL the ads disappeared. ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING!      Now I am back to zero ads again.      What did I do wrong? Have I been banned for...*ooohhhhh bad conduct*? Surely not... for what???      Can anyone advise on another affiliate program that is better than adsense, as I've no hair left to pull out and I'm feeling a little blue.      Oh, and if anyone can recommend a good forum/website/guru who is well known in the field I would love to know (please no affiliates / ebooks / ads thanks). Just somewhere that I can search for advice and maybe read some good articles.      xLightx      Why can't it be easy for heaven's sakes!!!

BEST ANSWER WILL HAVE MORE THAN 2 SENTENCES   I tried to get help from this site earlier but I forgot to mention some details. My laptop is a Sony Vaio produced some time between 2003-2005. It has Windows XP Service Pack 2 running at 2.8GHz with 1GB RAM.    The laptop will randomly go to 100% CPU Usage and then freeze. The freezing is completely random, it does not occur if I goto a certain website or program.    After it freezes, I hold the power button until it turns off, and then I turn it back on. Everytime I do this, Windows XP tells me that on of my harddrives needs to be checked for consistency.    What does this mean? How do I check it for consistency? How do I stop my computer from freezing?   I've run several malware removal programs and registry cleaners, I know those are not the problem.   Best Answer will have more than 2 sentences and will have serious backbone to it
