Remember when the AGW alarmists were predicting that global warming would ring the death knell of the ski industry?      If you don't, here's a link to one example of such baseless alarmism:       http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/apps/pb...       Apparently for the last two years, and three out of four years, the ski season has been characterized by ideal conditions - cold with snow.       http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont...        http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinati...        http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20081...       So, what happened to the cries of alarm?   Why are they among the many global warming predictions that have failed to come to fruition?      Or.... is THIS what they meant?   Is the climate threat to the ski industry the number of days in the season when it will be too COLD to ski?       http://thewomblog.com/?p=5558

My wife's younger sister is coming to town to stay with me for a couple of days because she has a job interview.      My wife warned me that college has turned her into a tree hugging hippie - but she still looks smoking hot.      Anyways, my wife told me to do the best I can around her when it comes to 'living green'      So I suggested that while she is here - we should shower together to save water.      Now my wife is reconsidering her long weekend away because of that comment.      Should I just recycle beer cans instead?

20090304091222AApTQ7c	Environment;Global Warming	How much of the recent temperature lull can be attributed to TSI?	Since 2000 or so, TSI has dropped by about 1.3 W/m^2    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...       In contrast, total anthropogenic forcing since the beginning of the industrial revolution has been about 1.6 W/m^2    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...       This 1.6 refers to a time period of about 120 years. So during the last 8 years, we should expect only (8/120)*1.6, or about 0.1 W/m^2 increase in associated greenhouse gas forcing.       But at the same time, we had a drop of 1.3 W/m^2 in solar forcing.       The drop in solar forcing is then 13 times greater than the expected rise from GHG forcing over the same time period--quite a large difference.      So how much has this TSI drop affected 2000-2008 temperatures?

The Aztecs thought so:      "Sometimes the obsession for control of the climate got a bit out of hand, as in the Aztec state, where the local scientific/religious establishment of the year 1500 had long since announced that the debate was over and that at least 20,000 human sacrifices a year were needed to keep the sun moving, the rain falling, and to stop climate change."       http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=544...

20090304111335AAbIkvf	Environment;Global Warming	Why aren't we in an ice age?	Okay, I know, technically we are, but we're in an interglaciation.  Why?  When you look at Vostok or Greenland ice cores, the most prominent feature is the sawtooth 100k year pattern of interglaciations.  Most of the time, temps peak, then drop slowly for an average of about 6k years, then fall back down to glaciation levels 6-8C colder than our 1800 norm.  But for the last 11,500 years, temps have always been within 2C of that baseline, and most of the time within .5C of that baseline.  This long period of steady temperatures is the biggest anomaly to the ice cores in several million years.  So why did the pattern stop?  Why didn't we slide back into a glacial period 6,000 years ago?  Does someone have a different way to interpret the pattern which would predict this long period of steady temperatures?  If so, when does this end and what's coming next?      As a tangent, I'll point out that Homo Sapiens have been around for about 200kyears, and our female common ancestor lived 187kyears ago, right as temperatures were starting to rise.  Likely she had some feature (lack of body hair, perhaps?) that was an advantage in a rapidly warming climate.  As a species we are on our second interglaciation.
20090304102244AAhVx8t	Environment;Global Warming	Has anyone compared the quality of references provided by skeptics to those used by the IPCC?	The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) publishes "impact factors" for most scientific journals.  An impact factor rates each journal in terms of its importance in a given field.  A journal much used by skeptics, Energy and Environment, is not even ranked since it doesn't meet accepted standards of peer-review.  So, has anyone compared average impact factor of references cited by the IPCC in one of their synthesis reports to the average impact factor of journals used by a skeptic in a non-peer-reviewed publication?  For instance, a very interesting comparison would be the references in the chapter Lindzen edited for the IPCC report and his position paper on climate.        I suspect the IPCC chapter will have a much higher average impact factor than the position paper.  If that is true, why would that be?      Impact factor explained:    http://www.thomsonreuters.com/business_u...       List of Impact Factors from 2006:   "http://abhayjere.com/Documents/Impact Factor 2006.pdf"
20090304100549AADVGiA	Environment;Global Warming	Why would you expect a linear response from a highly nonlinear system?	Skeptics commonly claim climate is too complicated to model, impossible to predict, and thoroughly misunderstood.  Yet skeptics then turn around and say there should be a direct correlation over all timescales between increases in CO2 and global mean temperature.  This seems at odds with what is known about nonlinear dynamics.        So, in a nonlinear system like climate, where there are positive and negative feedbacks running around, linear and nonlinear couplings between those feedbacks, multiple forcings operating on different timescales, all imposed on top of significant natural variability, why would one expect there to be a correlation of 1 between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global mean temperature?
