ENtu4Yraaa	Publix is the most cleanest. Winn-Dixie is the least expensive, but you have to be careful not to buy expired food. There is definitely a price difference when shopping between the two. So you can pay more for a nice shopping experience or pay less for a decent experience. I prefer Winn-Dixie and Walmart because I hate getting raped at the cash register, but I buy my fish at Publix because they don't buy it all from China like the other two. I think Albertson's is out of business, but they were even more expensive than Publix. I don't know Sweetbay.|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	Publix...... by far the best !
VzJcl7WAaa	look for a store that's more local/family owned.  and ask the manager if you can make a movie, just as long as your not gonna make a big mess he will most likely say yes.
AA11452852	At the Web link below, you will see an entry for Nsikak Okosi, living in Antioch, CA, and formerly living in Topeka and Manhattan, Kansas.  Unfortunately, they charge ($1.95) for the actual address.  It sounds like it could be your guy, but it is up to you whether you want to pursue it.    http://www.ussearch.com/consumer/ala/cat...    Good luck!!

(Here's a newspaper article about it.  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/busine...  Microloans are quite common in India.  See if you can find an affiliate of the Grameen Bank.|`|QY48ErA3aa	you can contact 'small scale industries'    or TN govt website
abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	try www.net4.in|`|65AEYuSHaa	www.vodahost.com 600 gb at a reasonable price, and the service is good...
wrMmU3Asaa	yes, i'm afraid for even one stamp you have to wait in line. especially if you don't want to buy a book of stamps. when it is your turn, you hand the envelope to the postal person, she/he will weigh it and let you know how much it will be. she/he will also ask you if you want overnight delivery (cost a fortune!), 2 day delivery, or standard rate. if you are not in a hurry for its arrival, standard rate should be fine. overnight delivery is never a good idea because the u.s. postal service does not guarantee overnight delivery even though you would pay the fee. hope this helps.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	If is just a letter, there is a coin machine that will get you a .42 cent stamp...Bring change..But if is a package..Just hang it to the dude in the counter and pay him cash, or credit card.  Sometimes, your local grocery store will have stamps to sell.  All you need is just one .42 cent stamp
AA11328275	There are a few in San Antonio, but they only have certain days that are scheduled for male strippers. Check locations around 35 and 410.|`|VnOnxZcyaa	you on the corner and show your ****. you'll get a stripper fo sure in ur apt.
x0flaLfUaa	Yes, no more pick and mix. Its hit me harder than I thought.|`|AA11366224	Not really.  Now they've gone, we can think back nostalgically to what they were in their glory days rather than the overpriced sweet shop they became.|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Kind of.    Edit - Clearly not everyone loved it that much because it went bust.|`|5589fbd695adfa2721fe85c5288a8fb9aa	i cry myself to sleep everynight thinking about it!|`|Z0nooDxDaa	not really, i never hardly went in their apart from gettin chocolate at christmas time.|`|QKh5gCkfaa	Woolworths has been in our Town since i was born i cant remeber it not being there so in that respect yes. But i never really went in there to buy anything.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	yes!|`|9HUjDaBVaa	You don't know what you've got till it's gone ;-(|`|nPFgW5XRaa	Not one iota.|`|442eea184ced6819a7d0e72ef6237acaaa	No definately not in the least.  You tell me 1 thing that Woolworths sold that no other shop anywhere else doesnt..... apart from a Woolworths carrier bag.  I am not sad in the least, apart from the people who lost their jobs through the stores closing.|`|RdHeKBUMaa	Wool-a-what?|`|hriNq1q7aa	yea - where do i get decent pick n mix from now!!|`|AA11327323	Not at all. It was at one time inexpensive, I noticed prices creeping up daily.                        As an example I was looking for a cheap plastic tray, the cheapest in store was 6.                          Just across the road was a Pound shop, every thing 1, I saw the exact same tray 1!                             They priced themselves out of the market.|`|Cqgv9Wx1aa	Not at all|`|yLK0q8M1aa	YES.  I really miss it!|`|B2WyO7gjaa	it didn't really make an inpact on life so no|`|AA11795089	we all grew up with wollies adults could do there thing kids could do theres if you grew up in  a small town you prob could only buy music from woolies.   ahhh woolies i miss you.    But that said in the end i was one of the many that never used you so i to are to blame.|`|CRzhErQPaa	We should go on strike to re-open woolies!!|`|9wtpCNb6aa	aww i remember going to woolies as a kid, and getting my pick n mix!!  I would actually eat more than what i put in my bag haha!  There isnt really any other shops that do pick and mixes like that :(    As for the rest of it, you can buy cds, dvds, home stuff from any other shop, but even still, my town wont look the same with out one...
AA11452852	The trick is NOT to go to a big, established store.  Sears won't copy the key.  Home Depot won't copy it.  And if you go to a real licensed locksmith, they might not copy it either. But if you go to a little key stand somewhere, you should have no problem.  If you are questioned about it, just make light of it.  One time, a guy pointed out that the key I had said do not duplicate, and I told him that it didn't matter, because it was *my* key.  I shrugged.  He shrugged.  And I walked away with a copy.  :-)    Just act confident, and you should be fine.  Good luck!!|`|5cdae57084e9f6937c40bc87aadc7941aa	yea pretty anyone will... unless your asian then go to a asian guy.. trust me. im serious.
cK28Kl0Uaa	Your property has an "easement" which means the business has the right to use your property as part of their driveway.  You cannot remove the access to their property.  Unless the other business needs your property for some reason, it would be doubtful they would be interested in leasing or purchasing your land.

7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	Getting a college graduate/post-graduate degree is not a difficult task these days. With the number of colleges and the corresponding management seats growing day-by-day.    The question is will this good students turn out to be good professionals.    I had worked as a Hr and placement officer and I can tell you from my heart - most engineering degree holders don't even speak basic English!|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	There are millions of Indians, who are graduates, no doubt, they are not employable, because of their inefficiency.
