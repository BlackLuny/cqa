I know this is old news for most of you but I've just heard of what she named her 2nd son "Zuma Nesta Rock Rosdale"..basically child abuse! Is she that desperate for attention?

20081002210348AACCsDE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you think about the morning after pill? and explain!?	whats your views on it?    all opinions are welcome...      this is my thoughts.   I dont believe in it personally. I think of it as abortion. If you have sex you should have to pay the consequences. I dont think people need to take the easy way out. Why kill a baby? To me any time you have sex you have a chance of getting pregnant, if your old enough to make that choice then your old enough to deal with whats to come.    If your fertile and have sex and get pregnant then the next day take the morning after pill your killing your baby... to me its a baby it moment its conceived, no matter how its conceived.   It shouldn't be used as a form of birth control. and it seems like it is.   I do think its acceptable if its dealing with a person who was raped, especially incest!       Okay so you know my opinion now i wanna here yours!!!!    And no you dont have to agree with me to answer. anyone can.    I especially wanna hear from people who have done this, for whatever reason.

20081003002728AAfJ0zQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Help me pick a girl name for a class assignment?	Our social studies class is doing some kind of pilot program on gender awareness and sensitivity and as part of it we are meant to do different role play things that are typically opposite to our normal gender roles. Our first assignment is to choose a first name (and a middle name is optional) which is the opposite of our gender and that we will use for the rest of the role plays and then write a few paragraphs about how we feel about our alternative name and whether it makes us feel different etc. I suppose I could just pick a name out of the air, but they all sound stupid so I'd thought I'd ask here and see what people would come up with. I'm a 16 yr old guy, and my name is Christian. I feel weird just picking a name so I will probably go with what the most common one is picked unless there is a real standout name LOL!

The last time i had sex was the 26th, and we used a condom. But just about a hour ago, i went to the bathroom, and a peice of a condom came out of me.. So now i dont know what to do. Im not sure if im pregnant or not.    and the last 3 days ive started a workout regime that i wanted to keep.. which consisted of 1day upper body workouts including the abs and arms, and 2nd day lower body, legs and thighs, and 3rd day (today) upper body again.      could this cause a misscarriage?, will this cause damage to the baby if i were pregnant? Im not due for my period until Nov.7th, so its too early to test,.. please help

20081104233353AAIUw7s	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im really confused. Did I have a miscarriage?	I havent had a period since the end of July and had sex when I was ovulating in August. I was on the pill for a month but would only spot for a day when i was on the last week. I have every symptom imaginable and everyone has been trying to tell me Im pregnant. Ive been in denial figuring its just coincidence. I always get negative urine tests so its not possible. And I broke up with my ex so I havent had sex since then so I really didn't think its possible. I finally got a positive. I stopped taking my bc and had another one day to two day spotting/light bleeding. I had an ultrasound done today and they didn't see a baby. Is it possible I miscarried? I have heard that some babies can "hide" during ultrasounds but I believe thats earlier in the pregnancy. Any ideas?

20090406102020AAYEAvH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What are some suggestions for teaching my 13 month old to be nice to his new baby brother?	My baby was born on Wednesday and we brought him home on Friday.  Our older two boys ages 3 1/2 and 13 months stayed with their grandparents in a hotel until yesterday.  Now they are home and really excited about their brother.  However, they really aren't sure what to do with him.  The oldest knows a little better and is a lot better with him but our little one is a little extra rough. I am working on showing him nice touches but I was wondering if anyone else had a good suggestion that worked with their older baby to ease the stress over it.  Currently he tries to pat the baby everywhere, but because he's so big it comes out more of a hit than a pat. I put my hand on his and say gentle or soft and help him rub the baby instead of pat.

20081116141612AASqbXZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	If you were told by a fifteen year old that something happened to them when they were younger...?	A crime, lets say they were sexually abused for example and after keeping it secret all their lives they confided in you to keep it secret, would you? Or would you tell the relevant authorities like their parents or the police? Or would you encourage them to tell the relevant authorities? What if you did do the latter and they got upset and wanted you to stop hassling them, would you continue to encourage them or would you let go?      I know I'm thinking so deep but that's what I do lol. But just think how difficult it must be for anyone to be put into that position.

20060905021606AALkQ93	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Pourquoi mon bébé de 18 mois pleure-t-il la nuit ?	Depuis plusieurs jours, mon fils de 18 mois se réveille vers 3 h du matin, et pleure pendant une demi-heure, une heure, une heure et demie, si on ne fait rien. La solution de facilité est de lui donner un biberon (et en ce cas il se rendort jusqu'à 7h30 ou 8h alors que d'habitude, il le réclame vers 6h), mais je ne veux pas corréler "pleurs" et "nourriture", d'autant plus que dans ma famille, ce lien est profondément ancré chez la plupart des hommes : on est angoissé, on mange ; on s'ennuie, on mange ; on a peur, on mange. J'aimerais avoir l'avis de parents qui ont vécu la même situation.

20090128210804AAHiiJp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 9 month old has always gone to bed at night very easily. Suddenly she cries and cries when I put her to bed?	I know she is tired b/c she is often half asleep when I put her in her crib. And she doesn't scream, she just cries. But it can last over half an hour. I have tried patting her butt and not talking to her every 5 minutes or so, to no avail. Nothing works but picking her up, taking her downstairs on the couch and having her on my lap. After about an hour of her being wide awake, I can put her back in her crib and she immediately goes to sleep. It doesn't seem to matter what time this all takes place. I have tried putting her to bed later, earlier, etc. Nothing is working. Any ideas/suggestions?

20090130154827AACucI0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do I feel like this? Like I kinda don't belong?	I feel like I'm not satisfied with my social life. I have a bunch of best friends, yes. But lately, I've been feeling like I should start making more friends. I don't know why exactly.       I've been telling my best friends (ALL girls) that I want more guy friends than girl friends. Not just any guy friends, but the skaters & trouble makers. That's really weird for me because people think of me as a goody goody. Which I hate. People think I'm all serious and no fun, which isn't true. I even think I'm too uptight though.       I'm starting to change a little bit. I want way more guy friends than girl friends AND I've kinda started to like sports. haha I think I'm turning tomboy. So basically I'm feeling like I don't fit in with the preps anymore (even though all of my friends are preps, I'm not.) My best girl friend has way more guy friends than girl friends and the guys she hangs with are exactly the guys I want to hang with. I just don't want to hang with her because I don't think her guy friends will like me.       Why do I feel like this? What do I do? &...how do I make guy friends?

IM dying i want to know and i really really feel like this is my momth!. Ok im 6DPO, (early i know)!. Since 3DPO ive been cramping (PERIOD-LIKE) cramping which ive never had so soon after ovulation. And tons and tons of creamy white (lotion like) discharge (CM). WHich Ive never had so soon after ovulation either. I usually get the discharge two days before my period starts. My next period is due FEB 11th.My breasts are a little sore. and last nite i couldnt fall asleep and when i did i woke up every hour cause i was starving (never happened to me before). I had to eat crackers and bread! Do these sound like promising symptoms to you? did the same things happen to you? Oh and this morning a had a tiny tiny watery pink amount of blood when i wiped??
20090130155216AABPHnQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you let your 13 year old daughter wear this?	A very low cut strapless dress and thigh high "stripper" boots. You know, black boots with a heel, that's what I call them haha. Anyway, my stepmom lets my 13 year old sister dress like that. It's funny, because when I was a teenager she made a bin thing about stuff I wore that wasn't even close to the things my sister wears. Also, she's all into religion, she wouldn't let my stepbrother go see Harry Potter because she said it was from the devil! I just think she's a big hypocrite. Do you think 13 year olds should be allowed to dress like that and would you let yours? I'm really surprised my dad Lets her get away with it, then again he pretty much has no opinion of his own when she's around.
20090130153241AAoWS6K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Is it cruel to not give my daughter anything to teach responsibility?	I have a 9 year old who is absolutely irresponsible with all her belongings.  She doesn't care if she loses her toys, she doesn't care if she leaves her jacket on the bus, etc.  We have tried grounding her, making her pay to replace things, etc.  Nothing works.  I have tried helping her by showing her how  to clean her room.  I have tried reminding her when she leaves things out.  The kicker was when I went in her room and found all her Ninetendo DS game cartridges scattered all over the floor.  This is a gift she received from her Grandmother for Christmas.  After picking them up, several were missing.  She had no idea what she had done with them.      I am at the point now where I don't want to give her ANYTHING anymore.  I mean no more new clothes, no more birthday gifts, no more easter baskets.  Not until she starts taking care of what she has now.        I explained to my Mother that we would not be doing anything for her for Valentine's Day or Easter this year.  My mom lost it on me telling me that would be cruel because we are going to get things for our older daughter.  I tried to explain that my daughter doesn't value anything because we keep just buying her more but my older daughter (she's 10) is responsible with her belongings.        Do you think that it would be cruel to just not get anything for my daughter for awhile until she starts showing us that she is going to be more responsible?

Also for most of the time the room was well ventilated but then it got cold so for some of the time there was very little ventilation. I think that I was 4 weeks pregnant when I was painting - how much should I be worrying about this?    Why don't the cans carry warnings?! Plus I didn't even know I was pregnant when I was painting!

She has had congestion and I have had to suction her nose a couple of times a day.  She hates it, so of course she cries her head off during and after.  This time, right at bedtime, Daddy decided he wanted to cheer her up by giving her a tiny bite of his chocolate ice cream.  I told him okay.  What could it hurt, right?      I'm not big on giving her sugar.  She just started on BLW a couple of weeks ago.  She's only had sweet potatoes, broccoli, bananas and breast milk.      But I know that a tiny taste won't hurt.      Anyway......three hours later and she's a wild woman!  She usually is in bed by now, but she is playing and squealing and laughing up a storm.      Could this have been caused by a tiny bite of ice cream?  Or is it the power of suggestion on our part?

Lately my breasts have been sore and heavy (and fuller..) I have been extremly exhausted.  I feel bloated, I have had some slight cramping, and kindof emotional.  I was thinking of testing on Sunday. Is that too soon?  if it is, when should i test?          Thanks for answering!
20090130193918AATRdIn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 weeks, feeling like someone punched me on my vagina =(?	I think the baby moved more down today because as time progresses I feel like someone punched me "down there" right above my pubic bone. (No that has never happened to me before but thats what it feels like).       It really hurts to touch too and it doesnt help when she moves. Called my doctor and she wasnt concerned....  This pain...is it normal when the baby drops further down? Is it supposed to hurt like this? I'm miserable >.<

20090130191331AAeqWiP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it my fault my boyfriend and his brother hate each other?	I feel like it is. They were best friends before I came along. I dated his brother, Jason who is my age when we were freshmen. All the way up until sophmore year. That's when he started being abusive, and even tried to kill me a few times. That's when I got close to his brother Josh. Who saved my life a few times. His brother is 2 years older than me, but one grade older. So by the middle of sophmore year, Josh and I were best friends, and Jason and I broke up. Josh then asked me out. Now I'm a senior in highschool, Josh is a freshmen in college, and we're still dating and in love. But I do still have feelings for Jason. Sometimes when Josh comes home from college, Jason gets really angry and tries to kill me. In which case Josh usually saves my life, and Jason hates him more. A month or two ago, Jason tried to force me to have sex with him, and Josh broke his arm. I'm currently friends with Jason now, and he's getting help, but they still hate each other. And I feel responsible. Am I just blaming myself again or is it really my fault? I mean, if it wasn't for me, they would still be close.

20090130192715AAPHiT6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would appreciate answers based on experience from self or someone you know.?	I was wondering if anyone has ever went through this and if it's possible that I could be further along. I had a miscarriage in Sept. I had my next menstrual Nov 1. Around mid November I had pinkish and brown spotting, very light, like implantation bleeding. Then I didn't have another period again til Dec 15th. Jan 1 I had the same thing, light spotting (implantation bleeding) and no period. I took 4 pregnancy tests from Dec 1-Jan 15 all which were negative. I took 2 more this past week and they were both positive. I was wondering is it possible that I have been pregnant since Nov? I know you shouldn't have a normal period if pregnant, but I have heard people say they did. Anyone ever have this after a miscarriage and were further along than they thought?

I have had problems with infertility in the past and have noticed many women and men suffer with the same problem. While doing genealogy the families had 6, 13, 17 and 22 kids per family. What's going on? How have we become less fertile?      I saw something on the news awhile back saying pharmaceuticals, including birth control, were found in the drinking water. On a radio program a dr was saying birth control could hinder a woman's ability to conceive the longer she was on it.      Is there any truths to these speculations or is it something else?

20090130192149AApVv6r	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Enabling or helpful to continually help someone?	As many of you know I volunteer at a womans shelter. We have a woman who uses our services numerous times per year when things get bad at home. We take her the hospital, buy her what is needed, and give her shelter until she heals. But she always returns home. The other volunteers and employees dislike dealing with her because she is a "lost cause". I disagree. I think she is someone who needs our help. Do you think continually helping someone and showing compassion is enabling or is it helpful regardless of what they choose?

This is my first pregnancy and I have tried so hard to get to this point. Last night, I was rearranging the room and decided to pull a dresser. It wasn't far but i still pulled it. After doing that I felt cramping, cramping that I didn't have before the I did that. Today I am still having cramps. I am about four weeks and 2 days pregnant.

20090130183549AAD94zf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When should I tell my family?	I am 8 weeks 2 days pregnant and haven't told any family but my husband and my MIL, not even my mother knows yet. The reason for this is I had a very scary threatened miscarriage at 4 weeks 3 days. I bleed until 6 weeks. I am a full-time student and missed the first week of school and am a little stressed about that though trying not to be. I had no morning sickness or any symptoms but sore boobs until 6 weeks when I stopped bleeding. Since then I have been throwing up, peeing a lot, and very moody. I have to sit right next to the door in class since I run to the bathroom at least once every class.      I am still very nervous and not sure when to spill the beans. My mom is an OB/GYN and I'm scared she would baby me and not let me go to school if she knew whats been going on. She was also recently diagnosed with Grave's disease and Chronic Kidney disease stage III and has had 8-9 kidney infections in the last year. I know around 12 weeks is when miscarriage risks go way down, but I wonder if I should wait a bit longer to tell just in case?      I want opinions on when I should tell. I'm 22 and married by the way, my mom will be thrilled as this will be her first grand-child, but I am worried for her health should something go wrong.

20090130183949AAaf85j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	On depo, spotting one day, Breasts hurting what could it be?	Me and my fiance had sex on new years eve. At that time i was on the depo shot. The next day i had a little spotting and thought i was getting my period. Then within a couple hours it was gone and hasnt returned since. This is weird because i ALWAYS have gotten my period every 3 months a week before im due for my next shot for like the last 4 years. So I just kind of let it go. I have been a little stressed out lately but I was stressed out ALOT a while before this happened and i didnt miss my period then. Now, I have not been feeling good ( puking the whole deal), I am really tired all the time no matter how much sleep i get, and the worst is that my breasts are hurting SO bad. Its hard to even take a shower or anything because it hurts when anything touches them. I have taken 2 HPT and both came up negative. I didnt go in for my shot because of this and we havent had sex since my shot ran out. I cant really afford to go in to the doctor right now to do a blood test so i will have to wait til my insurance at work kicks in in feb. Could i be pregnant or what else could it be?

He was premature by a month and wouldn't fed on the breast, so I had to pump for him. After a month and a half I dried up for some reason and could no longer produce milk. I had my post exam and the Dr just told me that it happens some times. I got back onto birth control.   The kicker is that just 2 days ago, one of my nipples felt funny, like it used to when I had to pump. I went into the bath room and squeezed my nipple and sure enough a small drop of milk came out. Why now? After so long? I know I'm not pregnant. How could there be any left over??   I haven't been able to talk to my dr yet. She is supposed to call on Monday.      Any Ideas?????

I'm 17 years old and about to graduate high school. (please, no lectures, I realize my situation and I do not need everyone constantly pointing out my mistakes). Anyways, I planned on still going to college, while my boyfriend works. We are planning to rent out a 4 bedroom house with his brother's family. My boyfriend only makes about $2,000 a month and he would have to put half of that towards rent. Then, after the rest of the bills; gas, electric, car payment, insurance, food, baby stuff, phone, cable, internet. It would add up to about $2,500 or so. Even though we would share the utilities bills with his brother, my boyfriend still wouldn't make enough to pay all of the bills. My mom said she would send me money each month, but since she's paying my car payments it would only be about $150 a month, which would only cover gas and maybe a little bit of food. I really wanted to go to college, and I still would do anything not to give that up. I was thinking of taking classes online, but I don't know how expensive that is, and also I don't know if it's really going to get me a good career in the end. I was thinking about getting welfare checks but I do not know if I qualify. I just want the best for my baby and I don't want to struggle for the rest of my life.

I will have a child with a Surrogate mother in California, Illinois, India or Ukraine.  This way the child has no legal mother and if you leave me, I get to keep the kid and be a single father, because you are not a legal guardian.  You can choice to use an anonymous egg donor or your own eggs.  This is the advice that my lawyer tells me, because he has seen man lose there kids in a divorce to many selfish woman.  They pay child support and never get to see there kids again.  I don’t want to take that change or take that gamble.        If you want children of which you give birth to, than you make sure that I am not the legal father.  They way you get to keep them in you ever leave me and I don’t have to pay court order child support.        I rather a single father and raise the child by my selves with no finical support of the mother and the government if the mother does not levee me in a civil manner she never gets to see them again.  I am rather in jail than pay child support to the mother because it is unfair.        If I leave you in an uncivil manner and I don’t let you see my kids that have bonded with you when they are over a certain age. If you leave me in a civilized manner, I just victimized my own kids and I am no better than those women if I don’t let you see them.        I cant trust you if you don't agree to this.

20090130183836AA8oGyR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do first borns get more quality time with their parents?	A lot of people claim that the youngest child gets the most attention in the family, but I never understood that. My parents always make promises that they will take me somewhere over the weekend and once my sister who moved out just calls the house in last minute and asks my parents to come over they instantly agree and forget they had plans with me. We go to my sister almost every weekend now. My parents never take me out during the week so I always look forward to the weekend, but lately all we've been doing is just going and sitting with my sister and her really boring husband for the whole day. They then just promise me next weekend they'll take me, but it's the same routine. Not only that, but whenever my sister and mom fight my mom just takes out her anger on me. If my sister says sorry, my mom instantly forgives her. With me it takes my mom up to days to forgive me and the things I do are just forgetting to clean my room. I'm pretty sure that's nothing compared to a daughter cussing out their mom.       Almost all the quality time, money, and love goes to my older sister. I really don't understand why it can't be equal. If my parents made plans with me first shouldn't they keep their promise? My mom has given at least thousands in the past couple months to my sister. I have to beg and go through all the rude remarks and looks when I just ask for 20 dollars once during a month. Is it like this with all firstborns? I've tried talking to my parents, they instantly deny treating my sister better.

He was sitting my bed and told me to stand up I did.He pulled my panted down made me go over his knee and spanked me like 14 times or more with his hand. Then grab ed the hairbrush and spanked me 11 times with it!! Ok today my but is still red!! No marks but really really red!! I don't think he had the right to put his hands on me!! He is leaving on a trip today so I don't have to see him for like 2 months. I don't want to make him sound like an evil guy he does not spank me but 2 or 3 times a year if I am really bad. I just think being in Middle school that he shoudl stop spanking me!! Do you think he was wrong!! He has never spanked me with an object until now!!

20090130184031AAe0xi4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How can I avoid this? Should I keep a friend with us? ?	Me and my boyfriend have been together for a few years. We're 16, he's almost 17, and we both have very strong beliefs against sex before marriage. We're both very school and church oriented and we both play multiple instruments for the school band. Our friends call us the ideal teenage couple and we would both agree. But lately, we've been getting a little carried away when we're alone. We've been through this before where we can't seem to stop but we always have. Neither of us want to destroy our morals or defile our bodies. We just don't want to go down a path of regretting each other in the future. We'd hate for that to happen. So, my question is, should I maybe try to have a friend with us until our hormones cool down a bit? If you've been through this stage of life, I'm sure you'll agree it is really hard to just say no and stop in your tracks. It's near impossible. Thank you

I really like him a lot, he's really respectful of my morals, and since we're both each other's first real relationship, we're constantly learning from each other. The farthest we've gone with each other is me giving him a handjob, but he started talking about his brother fingering his girlfriend and he seemed grossed out by it. (Note that he is new to all this stuff, which I am too but I'm not really grossed out by it) I was kinda even wanting to try that one day.      I was just wondering if teenage guys are grossed out by everything down there or what...? It kind of startled me when he was grossed out because all I've ever heard is that guys just wanna get in a girls pants. (hence he is respectful)      and another thing: will he always be grossed out about that stuff? or will he grow out of it?

I took another test this morning, right when I woke up to pee and it came out positive. I want to cry. The second line is so faint but I'm sure it's there.

So, I’ve been best friends with this girl down the street for 5 years. we have always had sooooo much fun together, she was a good listener and just cool. But about 5 months ago, she got this creepo of a boyfriend. Since him, she's been put on anti-anxiety meds, she has withdrawn herself from my circle of friends and now she just wont speak to us. the circle of friends has tried talking to her and including her in all that we do, etc. But she keeps saying "you guys never include me". even though she’s the one who is excluding herself. She keeps painting these screwed up fantasies in her mind. By this point, the circle gave up. We don't want to keep giving into a friendship in which we aren't giving anything back. But at the same time, we really don't want to lose her as a friend since we all love her sooooooo much. I hate many of her decisions and we both could have said/acted differently, and I understand that. At the current time, we aren't even speaking! How can I make peace with her? and I really want her to hear me out! I don't want to lose someone that close to me.       I was thinking of writing a heartfelt note and dropping it in her mailbox...would that work since she wont talk to me?

20090130201338AA4i9VU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to convince my mom to let me go to a mall out of town?	basicly every weekend me and my friends go to the mall. my curfew is ten, so at ten she comes and picks me up. buutt were tired of our mall so we want to go to one out of town and my moms friend would be the one to pick us up and wed probly be home earlier then usually, like 9ish.      heres the problem. were going their at 2pm. so my moms arguements will bee   1)why do you need to stay ther from 2-9!   2) (my friends mom has given me rides home before and both times i was later then ten so my mom was pissed) if ___ mom is giving you a ride how am i suppose to be sure your going to be home before ten!?   3) are you sure your JUST going to be you three and no one else?         now im not a bad kid but i mean im a teenager so its normal for my mom to suspect suspicious things but we seriously are just going to a new mall for fun maybe buy some food shop a bit and go home. and i double checked with my friends mom and she said shell deffinetly be there at 9 to pick us up.         but my mom is neverrr going to believe that! because my parents arethe type of parents that are over protective and usually make up stories in their heads of what happens. like example: i say im going to the mall with my friends they think : going to meet up with boys!! lol   i say going to ___ house to sleep over they think : going to a party!      but ive never done anything that would make them not trust me besides being late for my curfew like half an hour or so. and i tried to hide my bf from them,haha baddd idea but that was like a year ago.            so how can i answer all 3 of her suspisions listed above so she feels safe and has peace of mind about me going
20090130201437AAHkcK1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I am at a complete loss....?	I have a 7th grade stepchild who has failed a class the past 2 report cards she has gotten.  She has a complete lack of interest in anything that is vaguely educational at this point and it is driving me nuts.  Both my husband and her mother in my eyes have no idea how to discipline her.  The first time she failed, they grounded her for the next grading period.  Obviously that didn't work, seeing as she has yet again failed.  They have grounded her for the next grading period yet she has been re-enrolled in extra curricular activities (that we made her get out of when she failed the first time and which she enjoys), and even though is not supposed to play with friends, just this past weekend my husband allowed her outside to hang out with one of her friends.  I don't see the punishment in that.  What bothers me is this child is allowed to manipulate her parents, and the consequence is that she is going to continue to do poorly at school, which will just hurt her in the long run.  Her parents do not follow through with her punishment, and don't encourage her attempting to do better.  She never brings school work home, at least to our home, and doesn't complete in class work, etc. Obviously being she is my stepchild, I have no control over the disciplining, or do I want to.  I just feel like the only way to keep myself from not being mad, is to act as if I don't care about her success, which is not true.  I love her and don't want her to be a failure.
