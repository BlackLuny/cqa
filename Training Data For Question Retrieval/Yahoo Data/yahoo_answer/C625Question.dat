20090203065514AASfMVy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I say to him?	I have a facebook and came across someone who I used to be best friends with. We were friends since we were like 1 up until 5th grade because his mom had twins and they moved from my neighborhood then we hit middle school and in 7th grade he moved and started going to a private school. I used to go over his house in the morning before school would start cause my mom had to work and then after school we would play together. I want to say something to him cause I haven't spoken to him since he moved away and we were really good friends. I just get so nervous on what I should say I don't wanna say something stupid.

20090203070615AAbnRO9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should this have irritated me?	Ok yesterday I had to work until 6, usually i get off at 4.  I texted my boyfriend about dinner and said that we needed some ingredients for what we decided we were going to eat.  My boyfriend was at home playing PS3, he's a full time student so he gets off earlier than i do.  Instead of volunteering to pick up the ingredients, he just told me something else that we needed.  So after getting off of work 2 hours later than usual, i had to also go to the store, and then come home and make dinner.  Should it have irritated me that he didnt get the ingredients instead?
20090203070437AAgPWWQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if your boyfriend doesn't answer his cell phone twice when he's with you (HELP 10 pts.!)?	So we've been dating for 9 years (long time, I know) and are currently not living together (we both had to move back home) and only see each other once a week for a night if even but we talk daily.  I love him very much and he loves me.  We have had many problems over the years including both battling drug addiction (we are both clean or at least I AM) and cheating and this time living apart seems to be a good idea for now as we try to "start over" and let wounds heal.  However, I was at his house last night and his phone rang twice at two different times and he didn't answer it.  It's either #1 he really just didn't want to talk to the person, #2 it's an old drug buddy and he's still using or #3 A GIRL!  I had the chance to sneak and look at the missed calls this AM but I didn't.  I'm not like that.  I didn't ask either time who it was because I didn't want to start a fight.  He volunteered the second time "Oh, it's just so and so (some guy friend)" which makes me suspcious.  Should I have peeked?  Should I ask now?  What would you think?  THANKS.
20090203070357AAZlR92	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im fed up of getting hurt all the time.?	Hey there Im 18 and just left college. Im bisexual and for the past 3 years I have had really bad relationships where I have been heartbroken every time.    My first love was amazing, I loved him so much but it was just fooling around, it took me over a year to get over him. My next love was a girl from college, i fell for her nobody knew. Then recently Ive been seeing this guy who told me he was still in love with his ex gf, but wanted to give us a try. I tried but I just couldnt do it, I felt upset all the time and he always talked about her.    Im really hurting right now. My friend tells me I need to move on, I am trying to but no matter how much I hate him, I still love him.   Somebody give me some advice, no jokers, thankyou kindly.

I broke up with my ex-gf a year ago and have been single ever since with the exception of a few bad dates - there were definitely valid reasons why i broke up with her but after seeing what's out there, sometimes i feel like we could've worked on certaing things - everyone i know tells me to just move on and that she wasn't right for me - am i only thinking about her and missing her because i'm lonely or is it more than that - keep in mind i've spoken to her one other time a few months ago about getting back together, but she said she wanted to see other people while she would date me and i didnt want that - she also said she wouldn't sleep with me until she felt ready although she was hooking up with other guys - is this girl worth thinking about still?

20090203073126AAESuol	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should she still be my maid of honour?	We were best friends in high school 97-2000.  Did everything together back then I wanted her to be in my wedding if I ever got married in the future.        So in 2006, I decided to look for my old friends from high school; luckily I found them all on myspace.        We started hanging out again, slowly but surely, well I have been engaged for a year now and we plan to get married June of this year.        I asked my friend if she wanted to be Maid (matron of honour), I was like, I know it is sudden but I almost cried and so did she..."almost that is"      For the past year, on and off, I have been feeling like are we even friends like how we use to be?  Probably not, because, I have been disinvited to things 3 times in the past 7 months.      Well, she is having a baby in May and I feel/know things are going to be tense for her as it is this year.  Plus another person she has remained friends with since High School; well she is getting married in May 30 and I think she is either in the wedding or the maid of honour as well.      Well anyway to get to the question; I am trying to put everyone's feelings first before my own and I want her to be in my wedding but not for feeling pity or oblidged to.  I want her in it; because she wants to be and so far, we really haven't done anything that is like her being the maid of honour anyway.  Helping out and planning and what not.      She just helped me pick out my dress but that was the day of her check up and it would be more convient if we would have gone that day because, David's Bridal is in South Bend as well as her doctors.  I felt that she didn't even want me to come, because, she did ask me if I could drive there myself, meet them at david's bridal; than turns out, she thought I wanted to be in the doctor's room with her and I was like, no, I can sit in the waiting room.       I feel like looking/finding for my old friends has hurt me more than being without them.        What should I do?

When my mom was dying I found out he was still talking to his ex and pretending to be there for me. And over that past years hes cheated and lied about some pretty outrageous things. So I gave him a chance to change? Mistake? Well about a month ago we broke up.. Well when we did get back together we asked that dreaded question.. who have you hung out with? He lied to me and said he did nothing with anyone then I found out from one of his ex's in high school that they were a bit more that friends over a month.. How do I take this? Should I forgive him or move on?

20090203073227AAhQM0R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested in me?	I recently landed a new job at a local family restaurant as a take-out girl. I've been working there now for about 1 week, and there's a guy who works at the bar full-time, who looks about my age ( I thought he was gay too lol).      Well, something happened that made me think twice if he was gay.   When I went on my break, and walked up to the bar and he was smiling at me, asking if I wanted anything. I asked for a strawberry smoothie (those things are to die for! xD) and when he was finished making it, he said, "Don't worry about paying".   I was quite shocked, because the restaurant has very strict guidelines for this kind of thing, like giving free food/drinks away.      He also added, "just don't let the manager see you".   I've caught this bartender guy looking at me a few times during the rest of the shift and he would walk towards my area of the kitchen a few times which is completely strange....is this guy trying to show an interest in me?   It's unfortunate that we won't be able to talk much because how seperate our tasks are in the restaurant, and it gets really busy
20090203073333AANHyhM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When is it considered abuse?	my husband of almost 3 years has been verbally mean since the beginning of our relationship, telling me to shutup or calling me a baby when i was upset.  this behavior has gotten much much better over the course of our relationship, but last month he broke a window  out of anger at me, and then punched me in the arm a couple weeks later, last night we had a fight and he threw a full baby bottle at me.  he says he wasn't throwing it at me, but simply threw it cos he was mad.  he's not jealous, or controlling like that-but if we are having an arguement he lately has been losing out to his anger. but he denies it and tells me that it somehow was my fault that i made him act that way.  he's also very hurtful with his words saying things like, any other man would have left me by now, and im irresponsible.  i am a christian woman with two very small boys, i've been trying to be patient, but i'm so angry at him.  his words cut and when he acts out physically, sure it may be mild compared to the horror stories we've all heard about abuse, but it still makes me feel so depressed, betrayed..hurt.  i know i should just be patient, but i'm having trouble.  what steps should i take to right this?

I'm gonna have 5 bridesmaids and 5 groomsmen.        i don't have a lot of money to spare for the flowers.  i'm thinking of just going to the flower district and DIY my flowers but since the wedding is in the morning, it's kinda hard to set up the flowers before that.  the reception (and i'm pretty sure the church as well) would not let us set up the day before.

20090203073657AASsYye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want my ex teacher, I think he wants me too, can you help?	Okay... Long spiel warning....   So, I have this teacher I really like. When I was a junior I was a cadet teacher for him, during his planning period, so there was no actual class. We got to know each other really well. I talked to him about EVERYTHING. Anyways we were always close, and when we were alone his body language showed he was interested. I am now 19 and in college, he is 28. He is married (Spare me the moral lessons, I know! but I can't help my feelings!) and his wife is always VERY rude to me when he isn't around, and one time she called him and yelled at him for hanging around with me after school for too long. I saw him at a football game about a month ago and when I was leaving he hugged both me and my friend together, but turned his head towards me and pressed his nose to my ear. Then last week I emailed him, ranting b/c I could always talk to him easily. He asked me to meet him for coffee. When I met him we sat and talked for hours, he mentioned his wife was out of town for the weekend. When we parted he gave me a hug and pulled me tight pushing my chest flat against his.  When I see him he is very flirty, but when he emails me he is Very professional and distant... is it just b/c its a school email or is it something else? Is he really interested?
20090203073710AAjV8aW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am so hurt, he didnt lie bout his ex, but why is he still wanting me?	He said his ex is back for holi and he's excited, i thought he was trying to make me jealous after i told him i had an interest in a guy. He then asks me to hang out with him and stuff, i know he likes me cause he said so. I called him and he lied about where he was, when he was with his ex. He picked up immediatly and was nervous. Next day i see pics of them together and he calls her sexy (on facebook). Later on at night i say hi, he's acting so sweet with me. He is trying to talk to me, and stuff, but i kind of disappeared. Ive known him for a yr and a half, rejected all his invites to hang out, cuz i knew of that ex.       Why is he being nice to me? He misses me like hell when i travel or disappear.

20090203073933AAR8JmA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i believe my boyfriend?	So i started dating this guy that i've known for a few year's now.   He's cute, He's funny and he's really sweet.   He calls me about 4-5 times a day and always ask's about my day.   We talk on school night's till 2 or 3 in the morning, till we fall asleep on the phone together, We have alot in common too.   So here goes, he has a reputation of cheating and being a what you call "Man Hoe" when we started dating he told me he had changed and i had believed him.   His ex-girlfriend who happen's to be my bestfriend hates him alot, she'd do anything to get us to break up, she's telling me he wants me for sex and then he's going to leave me. I made it clear to him im not going to have sex with him until the time is right and plus were still early into the relationship. His bestfriend "Garret" is telling me the same thing, that he's stalling now and he's going to break up with me two days after he gets me in his room and he says im pissing him off to because im hanging out with alot of my guy friends. My boyfriend say's his friend is lieing and that he's done this already with three of his ex's, in trying to break them up with lies.    Now my boyfriend says everything everyone has said is lies, he said to trust him as he trusts in me.   I don't know who to believe,   My friend told me to believe him over my friends.   But i have no clue, im already falling for him and he told me he's falling for me.   People say that he knows just what to say and thats why he's just a sweetheart to me.    I don't know what to do, and i wanna stay with him.   Help?   Thanks(:

20090203073540AADwfWI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Emotional dependency or real love?	When I wake up and before I sleep, I think of him.      Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.      When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.      If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.      I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )      He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.      I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.      I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.      He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.      I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.      The thoughts of him makes me happy and hurt sometimes.      What he said is always very important to me.      Always looking forward to see him or talk to him.      Seeing him sleeping beside me makes me contented.      Likes doing things for him, just for him.      Likes to tidy up his room.            Is this real love for a person?

20090203074002AA2HQrI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this situation?	Well..it was the work night out and we had had some drinks. Now there is this girl that works with me and i have liked her ever since i started working there and there have been rumors flying that she likes me too. Now on the night out i accidentally kissed her, like a proper kiss. We had been laughing and joking all night and everyone was enjoying themselves. Like she was taking pictures of me and her whilst kissing my cheek etc. I don't remember what happened 2 minutes before it or two minutes after.I can only remember the kiss. It was like, one minute i'm standing with her ready to leave and she was taking pictures, next minute i'm real close to her..I don't even know why i did it. After it she said "wow steady on" and i was like "I'm so sorry, i didn't mean that at all." I honestly didn't mean it, it was a "mistake". Before i left i apologized again for what happened and then ran out the place. I think I'm gonna see her tomorrow at work and I'm thinking of apologizing again but i don't think it will be enough. I don't even know if she's angry by it. I think i've ruined my chances of ever going out with her now and so all i can hope for is that she can forgive me and understand that i didn't mean it.   Please help me!

20090203073756AAtMIzc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can this be right? Need opinions...?	I have a close relative who caught her spouse cheating after 30 yrs of marriage.  This is not the first time--but it really devastated her and she is not sure if she can forgive him. He is pretending nothing happened and is being a jerk.  She is and has always made more money than him throughout the marriage.  She went to see a good lawyer and he told her that if they divorce and decide to split everything, he would get 60 and she would get 40 because she makes more money.  He also told her she could fight him in court, but it would be costly and could take forever.  Is this correct?  Their kids are already grown and they do own a couple of properties.  I can't believe this is right, he was the one who was cheating, why should she have to pay him extra!!  Thanks for your help.
20090203073821AAytZHA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my girlfriend cheating on me?	My gf went for a business trip with her colleagues for one week, when she came back she showed me these pictures about the trip, things they've done and also some pictures of their last dinner in their last night there... in some of the picture there was somebody with his arm around her waist or her neck, a mens arm btw, apparently they had a bit too much wine. .... after a while I asked her in ironical way if she slept with one of them... of course she  said no but she also started to cry and yell and make a big thing out of it... she could've just say NO and I'd believe her... but now she just started to blame me and stuff... so... now I'm a bit skeptical about her honesty... dunno if she's really telling the truth or not. We've been living together for 3.5 years now. When we met for the first time she already had a BF and she also cheated on him.       Why would she me this huge drama about my question? maybe to make me really believe in her? or maybe to dissuade me from searching the truth?

20090220161409AAStaUN	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is hard to understand?	My mom has been sick for 5 months and in the hospital for a week. She depends on me for most things since she is widowed and my brother lives out of state and never even calls her. My mom will say she is so mad at him since I am left to do everything. One day this week though she said she is really getting tired of me and that I haven't done anything. Since she isn't driving she expects me to get groceries in for her and she wanted me to miss work a couple of days to take her to Doctors. She would complain about a part of her house she wanted painted. I notice since I did it for her she didn't even mention it. It is hard for me to understand how she will tell me I am left with everything to do and another time she will say I haven't done anything. I feel that with her being sick so long she is bound to act like I am good for nothing even though I know she would miss things if I didn't do them for her. What can anyone make of my mom?

My boyfriend lives where my parents live, where i'm from, and his parents live closer to me but stil an hour and a half away. we're all in florida so it's not difficult to meet each other, we just haven't done it yet. By a year..is that asking too much? Or what?

20090220160228AAjAc5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do about this boy? I can't do much, so advice?	Okay. So here's the thing, I never get excuses to write on Yahoo Answers about boys sooo.. here I go.      There's this boy, well my classmate.. he's been in school with me forever since I've moved to the Philippines in Jr High. Started off from 7th grade and now we're ending the 9th grade. In the 7th grade I never cared for him, I thought he was weird. In the 8th grade.. it got better I guess, we don't exactly talk but we've both changed so we talk a bit.. in the 9th grade things changed even more and we did as well.. we talked a bit more this yr and got closer and things as such. Considering we're only like 6 in a class where I live right now.. I just figure I guess that he's always been there I just never really got to know him, but we've always shared same taste in music and blah blah and we actually have a lot in common. Anywho.      Now.. I went to a Fall Out Boy concert with him in where my gal pal was supposed to go to, but she didn't so I had to go with this boy and his brother and in one day it actually turns out that I got to know him a lot and I find him as such a cool guy!!!! The next day, I got home from the concert after being with him a whole entire day in a car getting to the concert and having the time of my life.      So again, next day was valentines and he hung out with me and my gal pal and he usually NEVER goes out without another one of his guy friends and we had so much fun and we talked about things we've never talked before.. and he has a girlfriend which sucks, but she's older than him and taller and it's a sweet relation, I know his gf I just.. idk. They've been together for a yr now and all of the sudden 2 weeks ago after I got to know him I've started to feel for him.. and out of all guys I would have never known about liking him. It's only recently that I know that I feel jealous. And the girl isn't pretty but she's really smart and down to Earth and I kind of.. know the kind of relationship he wants which is kind of like fun and loving and Idk..       We've talked about his girlfriend and he told me he doesn't date her or hang out with her, only at school but they are cute and such.. I just don't know how to stop this feeling or whether I should let go into falling for him or not. I just feel like it's so wrong but I know that his gf is gonna leave him for college next yr. We're 16 by the way.      Sorry if this was long, but please.. some advice??

She lies and she like having all the attention on her. We had a BFF break up in Dec. I think. She seems to have matured a little and she doesn't seem that much of a liar anymore. I had feild trip today and Sarah is in my class so she was there too. There were groups with 10 ppl in each and she was in my group. After a while she let me copy her notes for this thing we had to do in 1 of the meusems then we started talking and after that we talked and talked and talked. I'm not sure if being her friend again is the bet idea though. So should I be her friend, but not a close one? Or should I jus blow the whole thing off entirley and not be her friend?
20090220160601AAzcK0z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WOW this WOMEN IS DRIVING ME INSANE!!!?	I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, We have a 2 year old daughter together. I am white, he is black. His mom is racist and HATES me. She does not think his daughter is his and refuses to say she is her grand-daughter. She says she doesn't want a white trash child in her house (speaking about our daughter). She calls me a whore and keeps trying to convince my boyfriend to leave me. Our daughter looks exactly like her father. My boyfriend and i have a great relationship and we are a happy family but his mother is causing fights between us. She always calls and says our daughter is not his and our daughter is too ugly to be her sons daughter. This is making it extremely tough. How do i cope with this? This is stressing me out to no end and i ball my eyes out. She has NEVER liked me and always says im a white trash hoe. I just don't understand why she won't except our beautiful baby girl. I've bent over backwards to get her to except me and my daughter but she won't. He does stick up for me and his daughter but his mom always makes him feel bad by saying "you just want me to die don't you!" or "you dont love me!!" and the whole process starts all over. He stopped talking to her for two months due to her treating me and our daughter like she has but then she calls and says " what if i died in those two months, how could you not care if your own mother dies!!" and stuff to that nature and it makes my boyfriend extremely upset because he lost his father 3 1/2 years ago unexpectedly.. I dont know what to do.. Please help?? I love him but his mother is CRAZY! I think her main problem is that i am white because she always makes remarks to her son about me being white. I of course as a mother am trying to keep my daughter away from her and away from the stuff she is saying because she doesn't deserve it.      BTW,We are going to get married but as of right now we are a little tight on money and i want to have a big wedding since i have a big family so we are waiting. I have a ring and he asked me to marry him so i guess you could call him my fiancee.

He always says I didn’t do it was you!    For example yesterday there was mud on the floor in the kitchen and he yells at me and says come clean this up! I say just because there is mud on the floor doesn’t mean that I did it and he says yes you did! But really he just doesn’t want to clean it up. And so he said to me before that we are not allowed to use the dyson sweeper on the breeze way and then he yells at me to bring it out there and sweep the floor cause there is mud on it. This there isn’t any mud!!! But he just wanted to yell at me or something then luckily his friend came over to pick him up from a meeting!!! YES THANK YOU DAN YOU SAVED MY LIFE!!! Lol   I am SO different at school I mean no 1 could even guess what happens to me at home. But the only deference is that my dad will get VERY mad ant hit my face *cry* ...I just want to kill myself...I’m going to tell my bf and get his opinion and my friends are trying to talk me out of it but if he loves me so much then he will try to stop me 2!!!

This is exactly what he said: " i love the taste, the temperature of it, and the color, and its just really good."      And he NEVER sleeps. Ever. i swear.      And hes really strong. He was just playfully biting me one day, but hes left bruises on me more than once. And hell grab me a little to strong sometimes.      And he goes out of town alot.      And hes outa town right now, but he said he thought he kept seeing me and i text back and said i was stalking him.. He told me he knew i wasnt because he would be able to smell me.

20090220160633AAStZWA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend gets mad when I bring up issues...?	It's a long distance relationship and he's flying down to see me in 2weeks time.      lately I haven't been missing him as much as I normally would and I think it might be because we get p*ssed off with each other a lot.      The other night I sent a picture to him of my ex friend to show him that she photoshopped a girl into the picture so she looks like she has friends. I was on the phone to him at the time. He then goes "Ooooh.. She's pretty hot. She's got big ****." And I got so upset, I felt like I was being compared to her or that he thought she was more attractive than I am. He didn't apologise for it. Last night I text him telling him that what he said upset me and he didn't write back. So I sent a few more messages and he told me he "dunno what to say." He still hasn't apologised for it. So I was thinking of telling him that his friend has a nice body just so he knows how I felt the other night.      When I bring up issues like how i'm feeling and what's been worrying me, he gets annoyed and defensive when it isn't even his fault and I don't understand why. He's always been like this ever since we met.      Months ago he told me that I could come to him and talk to him about anything... Right now I feel like that's all bull. He also told me that he'd be more attentive to my emotions but he hasn't kept his word.      I listen to him and help him when he's upset.. Why can't he do the same thing for me?      That's another thing... He was in a bad mood just because he had to sit in the back seat of the car when him and his family went out for tea. So he started texting me and I was trying to lighten him up and make it seem like sitting in the back wasn't so bad. But he threw it in my face and got even angrier and started going off at me and told me that I didn't care.      I'm starting to get really sick of the arguments. We argue or just get frustrated with each other 1-3 times a week. I don't know whether it's because we hardly get to see each other or if he's just an *ss hole.   We don't argue when we're together. Although one time when I was at his place I was saying to him that i'd hate it if he was in a car crash and he got defensive and goes "Are you saying i'm a sh*t driver!?" and I started crying and told him that he always does that... Thinks i'm blaming things on him. I wasn't even implying that he was a sh*t driver. So he hugged me and said sorry.      I really do love him and I honestly can't see myself being with any other guy and i'm sure he feels the same way... But right now the arguments and him not being a very caring bf is starting to take a toll and I feel that us breaking up would be the best thing for me. I can't tell him that though... He'll just get mad at me. If I do, i'd have to talk to him about it on the phone because he doesn't listen to what I have to say when it's through text or MSN. He'll stop writing back if he doesn't like what we're talking about... Which results in me having some sort of anxiety attack because I worry about us so much.      He's just turned 18 and i'm turning 17 in a few months. I want to move in with him and his parents some time next year but only if the arguments are minimised.      What do you guys think??
20090220160655AAbkgen	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Making ot with my boyfriend on the bed?	SO the other night I snuck my boyfriend into my house and well we're both 16 and have been together for about a month. So we are in my bedroom and we start kissing which leads to kissing on the bed which leads to our clothes slowly coming off and some pretty intense kissing and making out. The only problem is that we couldn't seem to find comfortable positions, I didn't know how to lie down on him without making him uncomfortable and when he lay on we he either had to suspend himself with his arms which seemed uncomfortable or he just lay on top of me and that was just uncomfortable for me. So does anyone know any good make out positions whilst on  bed? preferably one where I don't have to crouch because I am a bit self conscious with my clothes off. Please give detailed explanations I am really hopeless.

20090220161528AAd1xau	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So confused. Why my ex came back?	Okay, me and my now ex girlfriend i was her first real boyfriend as she was my first girlfriend, we have been broke up over 7 months now. , we had a good relationship we did everything together and i loved her deeply, then i changed after a 6 months with her, why i don't know.  i would be jealous, angry all the time, just wanted things my way, i did bad things, like really bad, like i wouldn't return her phone calls, always expected her to call me or text me, when i went to her house for the weekend, when i would get mad i would pack up my bags and she would just beg me to stay and cry, i promised her things, and never kept them, when i was around though i was good sometimes. This went on for a year and a half then one day she took her ex best friends ex boyfriend out to a foot ball game because he was lonely i didn't like him...he just seemed suspicious and i was afraid he would try to take her away from me...(jealousy), so she said i will call you at 10:30pm pst i said okay, so when i never got that call i blew up i told her i wouldn't ever trust her again, and i turned my phone off and i awoke the next morning to a crying girlfriend who said she didn't do anything wrong, i was still kind of upset but she got tired and said she couldn't take it anymore, so when we broke up i tried to break her and her best friends friendship up i wanted revenge. Failed miserably and i am glad i did.  But after 2 months i stared realizing what i had become, i went on myspace and tried to make amends for all the horrible things i did after i told her everything why i did it and that i was sorry i left with me and her a peace of mind, then 3 months later, she found me on myspace again and we talked and she started to cry so i comforted her, then i told her it's best if i disapear so she can live her life in peace and move on.  Then just two days ago she text me...why i don't know i asked and she said she doesn't know she just thought about me and started to cry.  Okay to the point, i know i was a bad person and i can't believe i put her through those things, there are nights where i cry and can't forgive myself for the things i did, but why would a girl who has been with a jerk like me, even bother to text me back?  Please i know you will all probably a say darn you were a jerk, trust me i hate the person i became, and am trying to make amends for what i did, and try to be a better person.

20090220163451AAK5STs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to say this right but please help?	Ok I went out with this guy and I really was falling in love with him. We went out for like 2 months which I know is a very short amount of time but we liked eachother waaay before then. Like for 5 months in total. And on January 2 he told me that it wasn't working out and that we should see other people. I was crushed, I felt like everything was falling apart and basically I didn't know what to do with myself. Now it's been almost two months since that night and I still feel the exact same. I'm still in love with him and I can't I just can't let him go. He likes other girls though, he's hooked up with someone and he want's to go out with some other girl. But he refuses to talk about anything from our relationship. He'll stop talking to me (texting) if I bring up my feelings about anything and it's really hurting me. I can't get over it and my life is a mess right now. What can I do? What should I do? I really don't believe I can get over him at this point. So please don't suggest it to me. And only serious answers because I basically just poured my heart out to a bunch of strangers.

20090220161944AAKmib4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Hmm..Should I continue this tradition? Read Below Please.?	Every Friday my good friend Destiny and I celebrate the weekend by going to the mall at 7:30 and chug a bunch of monsters to get hyper and run around  the mall acting like idiots. Don't ask. Well, she has invited three of her friends to join us on this tradition, Elliot, Camilla, and Sara. She loves her friends dearly just as well as she loves me, but lately I feel as though she has to much in common with them and pays much more attention to them and completely ignores me. She has her back faced toward me, so I get out my phone and play with it and she gets mad. So I did not bring my phone and she said she really appriciated it and she continued ignoring me. I try to talk but she goes off on something I don't even have a clue what she means and finds that in common with her other friends and begins a big conversation, acting as though I am not there. Destiny is an amazing friend, really, I just don't think this tradition is working out. Should I skip the mall from now on, or give her another chance? I have not gone to the mall in a while, so should I give it one last try? What would you do?

I thought we were friends but I was couldn't be anymore wrong. Her friend called her and then put me on (I didn't ask, she called by herself). She sounded "sad". She said sorry 2 or 3 times. I don't care. I don't want to communicate with her ever again. She's a two faced traitor. I felt humiliation at its fullest. She was just about my only "friend". I was very disappointed today...very.

20090220162346AATtKkG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He has a question...?	Hi guys =D my friend Justin has a question to ask about a girl that he likes, soo here it goes:      basically, he really likes this girl in his class. they would always laugh and smile with eachother & they made eye contact a lot. they would ask eachother how they were, etc. blah blah blah lol and now, he realizes that he likes her as more than a friend and wants to get to know her better ! but one problem, he's now extrememly nervous to talk to her ! gosh, it's terrible isn't it ? he looks at her a lot and so does she, but they never talk. she shyly smiles in his direction all of the time, and laughs at anything he says, even if they're not near eachother. What should he do ?? how can he randomly start a conversation with her again ? and also, he wants to know how you think she is feeling or if she likes him. I personally think she is probably confused and has feelings for him that she's also shy to tell him. thank you =)
20090220173312AA4yjAo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ladies What Would You Do In This Situation?	Ok, So there's this girl at my husband's job, I'v always had this uneasy feeling about her, And not too sure why. Well my Hubby left in a hurry today and left his phone, I didn't know he did, So I text him and asked him something. I heard his phone beep and noticed he left it so I deleted what I sent him, Well under that message was a message from a number that wasn't programmed into his phone, It said "Hey square can you tell me when I work please" Keep in mind him and I have an inside joke about calling eachother square. So I asked him who it was and he said, Amanda. Which is the chick I'v had this uneasy feeling about. So why would she have to go thru all the trouble of calling the job and asking for his number at the front desk when she could just ask them when she works or be connected to the kitchen and ask that way. He says she asked the front desk for it, But when she text him she didn't say who she was, She just asked. I'm so mad right now. I would just like some opinions please!!

20090220163153AAPOzRS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need some answers ASAP! If your boyfriend invited you to his ex's sisters 21st, would you go?	OK, so I've been going out with this guy for almost 2 months, and I work with his ex girlfriend. Last week he invited me to her sisters 21st. I didn't really want to go, but accepted to be polite. Anyway, we had made plans to do something last night (he and I), which he ended up blowing off to hang out with his parents & their friends (????) , so I caught up with my own friends instead. This annoyed him, and I didn't hear from him at all yesterday.   Now he has sent me a message asking me to tea before the 21st, but I really don't want to go now. I want to be appreciated and not just used when it suits (as a date to a party, where his ex will obviously be there, someone who was very ***** when we started going out).   Should I just go and get it over with, or what decent excuse could I use (or what could I say) to get out of going?

20090220165440AAAeHjf	Family & Relationships;Friends	I was talking to some friends and this subject came up and I was wondering if all girls feel this way?	Some one made a joke about a girl masturbating, and all the girls there were like yuck, eewwww, sick! One of them said that anyone who does it is a sick pervert. There were about 7 girls there. Do you think they really felt this way or just thought they should say that? I've heard that almost as many girls do it as guys.
20090220162658AAFTsYa	Family & Relationships;Friends	So I have this friend treating me a little badly..?	THIS IS LONG BUT I REALLY NEED HELP!         Ok so I have this friend right? Let's say her name is Holly. Well, Holly is in a lot of my classes and I see her everyday. I sit at her lunch table with 2 other girls so altogether there is 4 of us at that table. Holly and I had some problems last year, and there was this huge problem over a concert-birthday party she had and I wasn't invited. Anyways, we have been friends since mid 6th grade and now we are in 8th grade. I often ask if she wants to do anything over the weekends but she always says she is busy with someone else. Whenever I talk to her she seems uninterested and as though she doesn't really want to talk to me. Whenever she talks to anyone else her voice is filled with more exictement and seems like she wants to talk to them more. I haven't done anything with my friends in a few weeks because my one friend lives in the other town that goes to our district and well none of us really do much with her because i dont even know, my other friend kind of strays with what Holly wants to do, or makes plans with her friend from Gymnastics. Well I was texting Holly earlier today and told her that I felt leftout, and we havent hung out in a while, and whenever she talks to me I think it seems like she is mad/angry/ whatever it is and she doesnt want to talk me to. She replied "Oh well I'm sorry you feel that way and these people I haven't talked to in months and I'm trying to reconnect." She does talk to these people, and it definitely hasn't been months. Some of them are on the other team in our grade. (We have team A and team B).      So basically I don't know what to do. I want to go sit at another table, but my school is in a somewhat small town and in my team there are not really any more tables I could sit at. There is one but I fear that if I sit there then the "proctors" will come over and say that there are too many people at that table, or one certain person will ask me why I am sitting with them and not my usual table. (Not in a mean way just in a is there something wrong... what happened kind of thing). Also at that table most everyone plays Basketball or Soccer, and I'm not really athletic, I'm a cheerleader, so I don't really think I would fit in.       I could sit at maybe one other table - But a friend that I stopped being friends with in 6th grade sits there and I just don't really want to get into that whole situation. I said some things back then to try and get out of that friendship because all she wanted was to be popular, and all I wanted was true friends.         So before you go and say I am the hated person at our lunch table that isn't exactly true. I'm only having problems with Holly and none of the other girls. I'm just wondering what you guys think that I should do?

20090220161901AAFD62m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What I don't understand about guys?	I'm in high school and I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, he turns his head and looks the opposite direction. I told my friends about this and they said he's starting to like me. When I was walking slowly to 6th period today, Shane quickly walked past me. Then a couple of his friends walked next to me. One of them yelled Holy S*** in my face. Then he said "Sorry" in a joking way. After that, they left to catch up with Shane. Now every time I look at Shane, he's not the one who's looking at me, its his friends. What was that whole yelling thing about?? Why are his friends always glancing at me? They never did that before. Does Shane like me? Should I talk to him for the first time about this? What should I say?

We have talked about marriage and we both like the idea but Im not sure how to let him know I would love to marry him.

20090220162952AAqU95m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She thinks I used her?	She thinks I used her?   I broke up with my gf for 5 months because she cheated on me while drunk. I got involved with this sweet, classy girl. We did everyting couples did just didnt start officially dating cuz i told her i was too busy for school for a relationship. I told her I could see myself marrying her. I told her I really liked her and was over my ex. But now im back with my ex...the only reason why i showed feelings for her was to show her what bad boys could do to her. and when she found out she said she felt used. Does she have the right to feel used? Was what I did wrong, putting those ideas into her head...only to break her heart and go back to my ex?
20090220162739AAYS9qV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he's cheating on me?	okay, here's the deal... My boyfriend and i have been dating for four months, and ever since then i have had this...   PERSON 1(supposed to be my best friend.): he went the whole 9 yards with another girl!   (later i figure out she's been talking a BUNCH of sh*it on me.reason? idfk.)   ANOTHER PERSON: he says he broke up with you...      i confronted him about it, and he told me that person 1 was trying to get with him. and he told me "another person" liked him since they met.      Now i just don't know what to do, my mother says "you never know, you only see him like every saturday, he could be cheating."   and i brought up the point to her, "why would my boyfriend text my other best friend who wouldnt try getting with him telling her, "how much he loves me, and cherishes me, and wants to be with me for a long time."    (oh yeah, i let him text my bestfriend because he's very sick and has been in the hospital, and keeps me up to date with whats going on. and i let her talk to him a couple times. because i can trust this girl with my life).    Then my mother brought up the point, "that you cant trust any guy, because most are out to hurt you".      In my heart i believe he is not, i just need that backup opinion, i've also asked my 2 newer best friends, they do not think he is, they practically slap me for thinking so...      I do have trust issues, because i've been cheated on in every relationship i've ever had, my heart is on a thread, and it hurts :'(      thank you for you're time, i'd really appreciate it if you'd give me a good answer that will help me, none that say anything stupid and not worth my time.

He has a great personality, good looking, and I really do like him in general. Well, I'm not one of those touchy-feely people, I'm okay with doing basic things (hugging, kissing) but I think he is almost disappointed with the fact I am not very 'forward'. Is it a good enough reason to want to take things slowly with him? Or should I be more, 'touchy' with him? I really want this to work, and I feel maybe I should be more forward with him.    On that note, what are some little things I could do to be more touchy?      Thank you.

She has always told me that I am her best friend, but I have never felt we were that close. We hardly ever talk and that last time I saw her was over 4 months ago.       Last week she called me and asked if I would be her maid of honor. Her boyfriend is deployed and has not even proposed yet. They have not picked out a ring or even set a wedding date.       Already she is asking me to go ring shopping, dress shopping and work on making wedding invitations with her.       After working all day and then coming home and taking care of my family, I really don't have the time or energy to help her plan this wedding that may not even happen. Any ideas on how to respectfully decline her request to be maid of honor?

He broke up with me on new years and said he "needs to be alone to figure his life out"...well I was a COMPLETE WRECK. i left him alone for about a week and then I called him saying I missed him and wanted another chance...he pretty much blew me off and said hes not about another chance he "just needs to figure his **** out" well he agreed to hang out with me the next day then turned around and said "somethings came up" and that night my friend saw him at a bar with his best friend.       last night I heard he has been drinking at the bar alone...by himself...starring off into space a lot recently. i gave up on him and haven't texted or called in a while.      well, last night I get a text from him saying "Hi how are ya?" and just about choked... I honestly didn't expect to hear anything from him ever again/not for a REALLY LONG TIME.       I didn't say anything back. I didn't really know what to say. Plus I have ALWAYS texted him back and been there for him. I guess I'm kind of sick of only being good enough when its "convenient for him" so I'm making him think/giving him time to realize he misses me and GIVING HIM THE SPACE HE ASKED FOR.      Good ideato make him sweat or should I text him back if I really want to be with him again?
20090220162354AADZmSE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Known him for 12 years & just started dating but its moving too fast! Please help!?	I've known this really sweet guy for about 12 years now through friends but I never really got to truely "know" him b/c for the most part we were both in longterm relationships. We've always had a thing for each other but never really acted on it until just recently when me, him and some of our friends went to a parade together.      We ended up getting stuck in a traffic jam and after a few hours of talking & laughing me & him ended up kissing. It was the best kiss I've ever had in my freaking life (and the longest) and he was really respectful & sweet and never even tried to grope me even though we had been drinking. He would just look in my eyes and go back to lovingly kissing me. We ended up kissing for hours and ended up having sex and fell asleep together.       The next day we got together again and talked and kissed for a few more hours. He was already talking about our "relationship" and I went along with it b/c I really like him (always have) and don't want to be with anyone else.      I realized that was way too fast and told him I don't want to be in a relationship with him yet and since we hardly know each other it was a little crazy to say we were..and he was a little upset but agreed.  During the past few days we tried SAYING "lets just be friends and get to know each other and take it slow" but we don't ACT like it at all...we've been acting like we've been dating as long as we've known each other (for 12 years)    In a matter of days we have spent hours mostly talking & laughing and of course kissing & have tried to slow down on the sex but things are still moving WAY too fast and I don't know how to really back off and still try to get to know him at the same time...   Every time I back off and try to not answer when he calls or try not to get together, I feel bad about it because I still want to get to know him better and I love being around him and don't want him to get the impression I'm not intersted.       His last relationship (which ended about 2 years ago) well it lasted 6 YEARS and he was burned really bad and she cheated on him so I've noticed he's a little insecure when I'm trying to play "hard to get". I don't want him to think I'm interested in anyone else so I've given in to him a lot more than I should have.    We don't really know each other that well yet and have had such an amazing time together and things are moving SO FAST that we both have already said we have feelings for each other.    At the same time I've noticed we have talked about our "relationship" so much I think it's killing it by talking about it so much....like we're trying SO hard to not do the things that messed it up before that it's killing the spark ;(      Please help! How do I back out of this and take things slower without sounding like I'm uninterested or seeing someone else? How do we get to know each other better and back off at the same time or is that even possible? Any advice would help ;) Thanks
20090220162356AAj6nIf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in an illegal relationship.......HELP ME?	I'm in love with the most amazing guy I have ever met. He is very wealthy for only his age. He has a very good job and a very nice house that he owns. He drives a cadillac escalade which, yes, is paid off already! He only wears certain clothes, like Abercombie, American Eagle, Doclce and Gabonna. He is the sweetest thing I have ever met. He is such a nice person, at least to me, his friends, his family, and SOME of my friends. We are sexually involved with each other. Marriage has been brought up in some conversations and seem quite possible in the future. Sometime's I lie about his age and say he is 21 to my friends that are out of high school. The only problem is that I'm 17, and he's 26. And he's a teacher at my school. Is there any way I could , or we could, make it work? Can you help me? PLEASE HELP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

20090220163523AAbkWe6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl with a boyfriend is extremely flirting with me what should i do?	For the past few days i got to know a girl in one of my classes now shes flirting with me alot and i'm only starting to know her.      were both 15 and in HighSchool  but her boyfriend is a year or 2 older than us. Anyways today at lunch i was talking with my friend then her and her friend came up to us and were talking to us, so we decided to all go to lunch together on the way out the door she smacked my behind, i kinda didn't take it in any way because girls usually do that to me. halfway to where we were going she grabbed my hand as if we were going out and she said we'll be lunch buddies. i replied jokingly saying "sure we'll go out for lunch every school day". it felt kinda awkward saying that because i wasn't sure if she had a boyfriend and not to mention she has alot of guy friends but she never does this to them i've seen her hang out with guys but never holding them or touching them in anyway. when ever i go to school in the morning she usually looks away from her big groups of friends like about 14 people, and stares at me but i pretend i don't notice her even though we will talk later on in the day. So on the way to the place we were having lunch she started touching me alot even in serious places if you know what i meen.   then my friend asked her some silly questions because he knew what was going on then she said "i have a boyfriend you know".   at that point i felt so sick to my stomach. i felt bad for the guy.   to make matters worse at the place we were having lunch she held my hands again as if we were going out then her friend pointed to her that her boyfriend was there, then she said "i kinda feel bad" then she let go of my arms and started to act like nothing happened , fixing her dress and hair etc. after that we walked back to school but she didn't talk to me and she was walking infront of me and my friend.      in our class together she didn't talk to me and she was on her cell phone alot and she didn't smile she NEVER brings out her cell phone in class. i'm thinking her BoyFriend saw us and dumped her or shes just telling her friends of what happened this situation is so awkward the feeling i'm gettin in my stomach is so sick i've even lost my appetite. also i kinda have a crush on her. her boyfriend is also one of my friends friend and i respect their relationship. I REALLY don't want to be the reason their relationship ends or her being upset because i've developed these feelings for her.The way we flirted, if we stopped talking to each other because of what happened will feel Really... i can't explain since where in highschool and all this pressure w/e but yea i have no clue whats gonna happen next week in school. what should i do?

20090220163857AAYlPtm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it wrong for a 13 year old to be friends with a 23 year old guy?	like the 13 year old is JUST FRIENDS with the older guy. she and him aren't involved in anything more. they're just friends and the guy is pretty nice to her. he knows alot about science and helps the 13 year old with homework if she needs it and it's obvious he seems to have a deeper interest in the little teen and she knows that too, but she tells him that they're only FRIENDS for now because of the big age difference and that when she's 16 or older she might consider dating him and the guy accepts to keep their friendship to a steady level even though it's obvious the guy seems to have some sort of crush on her. but other than that, he respects her and surprisingly, doesn't try to do anything bad to her. i know this 13 year old actually and she's my cousin and i'm surprised her parents are letting her be friends with a 23 year old cuz when i see them together, they act normal and just friendly around each other, nothing inappropriate or anything and i'm actually kinda surprised a TWENTY THREE year old GUY could actually control himself around the teenager. he seems like a good guy, but i sometimes feel suspicious about it. i've been asking my cousin about him and she says he's doing pretty well, for a twenty three year old, for being her friend. she told me that HE even wants to PROPOSE to her when she's like eighteen or twenty years old and he wants to marry her, but he knows he can't cuz it would be illegal. but yet he's willing to wait. is this NORMAL behavior for a TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD??? does he sound ok to u??? i don't know what to think about it. to me it just seems kinda strange.
20090220163928AAQfxPq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I Kill Myself?	Right now I'm so depressed and sad its not even funny but at the same time im very mad.  I'm so angry I want to just rage against everything and break stuff.  When I punch the wall or any other object I feel no pain.  I was never a person who felt like this, I was so happy and lively but that all went away because of this.  This guy that I love and who also loves me just told me he dating a girl.  Its so long of a story I can't even explain it all but we knew each other for some years and now it just seems like it went all down the drain.  He told me he loves me more than who he is with now and that he only likes the girl.  Also that he would pick me above everyone else.  The reason he decided to do this is because I'm not there.  At the moment we arent even friends, I dont even know.        You don't even know this guy was so different from all the other ones.  I mean it so much and we were the greatest of friends before this too.      ugh. i just feel like dieing      i gave up completely.      what should i do

20090220170328AAe5oDh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, what does this mean? PLEASE HELP!?	So there's this guy that I have a crush on... And I think he might like me... And whenever I walk by him he will kinda look the other direction and sigh.  Not an eye-fluttering loving sigh, but almost in disappointment...  Well, I'm not sure if that's the case, but it looks like someone who would be sad... Sometimes he will be talking to his friend, and laughing and having a good time, but then he might see me, and his smile fades...  It turns into almost regret maybe... I'm not sure, but im wondering what he might be trying to say or what he is feeling.      A way to describe how he looks when his smile fades is like someone feeling sad after a big disappointment or something... It's hard to describe but if someone had just received an insult then they would sort of look down at the floor and half-frown sort of.  It's really hard to explain, but that's the best I can do.      What does this mean?  Maybe it's the way I am looking at HIM?  Please help!

20060919175126AAgCgSZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Financial insecurities within a relationship..how do you overcome?	What do I do when my guy seems insecure about his family's money compared to mine? My family are more well off, and live in a big city. His parents aren't as well off, and live in a small town. The problem is, he had to move back home for certain reasons, but before he left he hinted to me, that he was worried about what my parents would think of him or his family financially. For some reason, he thinks that they might be snobby or have high standards, which is not the case! They are humble people, but since he hadn't met my parents yet he didn't know. The only reason why I think that is because he told me that I wear nice clothes & drive a nice car, so he might look at me & think my parents must have high standards that he could never live up to. But it's not true, my family & I love people for who they are, not money. I don't want his "thinking" to get in the way of a potential serious relationship. We had a great relationship for a year casually.

I've always said that if I were fortunate enough to be blessed with a large home I would entertain and open my home to family, friends, and neighbors. I always make certain that when ppl come by or drop in that there is something out to drink and snack on.  Also on Sunday nights, I always cook a large pot of speggetti.  This is a known thing about my house.  On Sat nights, we light the chiminea and sit around and BS and have wine and cheese.  I really LOVE it.

20070829222101AAOYS9A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Give him a chance or tell him we should just stay friends?	I have been talking to this guy for the past few months, we have gotten semi-close I guess you could say. We haven't hung out, we talk via Myspace or text messages. He's asked me out (as in to be his girlfriend) a few times, I told him, "Not right now." or some other excuse. He's also asked me out on dates. Well, just recently he asked me to the movies, and I am considering it. I am just afraid of what some people would say if they found out I went. Lately, I'm finding myself falling for him, which I haven't told anyone. One of my friend's said I should go, because he has a great personality. (She's the only one I told he asked me.)   What should I do? I know, I've probably answered my own question. Sorry, if this was confusing! Thanks!

20070615150458AAgxbJ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What did you think of this thing that happened in "The Cable Guy"?	As the beginning of the show, this guy played by Matthew Broderick was thrown out of the house after he asked his girlfriend played by Leslie Mann, to marry him.      Don't you think that was uncalled for? He proposed to her and then she wants him out of the house. A little odd, in my opinion. Maybe she was just scared of commitment.            I KNOW IT WAS JUST MOVIE, BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE A GIRL WANTING HER BOYFRIEND OUT OF THE HOUSE AFTER HE JUST POPS THE QUESTION?

20070822075712AAuypzt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How should we tell my parents that we are engaged?	My parents are very traditional, and always wanted me to finish my graduate degree before I got married. My fiance and I are both 20 years old, in our third year of college. We plan to marry after we graduate from college in 1 year. How should I tell my parents? His parents approve and are very happy for us, but up to now my parents have refused to even MEET my boyfriend because they know that if they meet him they'll have to discuss marriage... and they just don't think I'm old enough to do that yet. How should I tell them that he is now my fiance, and that he wants to meet them to tell them our plans for marriage?      I just know that my dad will get really mad and refuse to speak to me or something... I know they can't PREVENT us from getting married, but I would love to have my parents' blessings. How best to do this? What should we be prepared with?       Thank you!

Even some of his friends are telling me that. I don't know if it's true yet, and I'm really confused. They're all saying we'll be great together and stuff. We're kinda friends right now, and we send notes to each other cuz it's the only way we can talk since we're not in the same homeroom anymore. He's, like, starting to hint that he likes me. I tell myself that I'll tell him at the end of the year, but I think I wanna tell him sooner. I don't know what to do! Can anyone help me???????? Please!!!!!

I am a  black man and im just wondering about this because I have always been attracted to asian women, I  cant really explain why, there's just something alluring about them. I'm not the hip hop/ rap music video type, and I am good looking with a 6'4" 210 build.

20070119201357AATNZRn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So confused with relationships?	Ahkay here;s the deal I've been going out with this guy, David for a month and a half we broke up today. During half the time we were dating, my best guy friend, James, had a major crush on me and he still does. I like him too but the problem is that my best girl friend, Missy, really likes James. I talked to her a few minutes ago and she guessed there was something going on between us, and she said she was okay with it, but I really don't want to hurt her, I'm afraid she might be hiding her feelings. I've known James since 3rd grade and it's really wierd that we both feel this way now. After having a brother-sister, best friend relationship for so long. I really like him. I mean he was there for me when David and I broke up. He gave me good advice too. I think I might love him. But I really don't know what I'm supposed to do. Help, anyone???
20061027194950AASoCcL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told her how I felt...now what?	Long story short - I have been close friends with a girl for about six months. I grew to develop boyfriend-girlfriend feelings toward her, and finally got the courage to tell her how I felt. She just recently got out of a long-term relationship with a boyfriend (with him about a year) and has not been without a boyfriend for a significant period of time for a long time. Anyway, she said it was not the right time, and that she was not interested in getting into a relationship with anybody now. Essentially, she wants to be on her own for a while and learn what she wants to do with her life (we are both in our early 20s). She said she would not shut the door on something happening down the road however, and she did not seem uncomfortable talking about the situation (like uninterested girls might).       After looking at these message boards, I am a little disheartened. It seems like everyone here thinks that this type of response means that she is just feeding me a line, that I am and alw

20070810185414AABSfPZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...maybe you can understand this better than me help!!?	ok I asked this once already but there seems to be confusion so, lemme just say what is important what I want to know.    the facts :   my ex and I had dated for two years, he wanted to marry me...   we've been split for like a month, he already has another girlfriend"   we talk occasionally not often...last we spoke he said he loves me...but he made it clear he can't be with me until he sees that I have changed my extremely bad habits...which I recognized on my own and am changing for me.   I am initiating most of the conversations...but I am working to cut it down until he contacts me   i'm already working on preparing to move on for good, though i do want to try again with him.   my question really regards a text and what that means for me,   I sent him a text that said:  "Been meaning to ask you how you've been but didn't want to intrude. perhaps sometime soon we'll catch up. Until then"   he responded rather quickly with: "yeah we will talk some time."   what does it mean for me? good? bad?
20070826193419AAOjNDO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when your holding on to long?	I am still in love with my ex boyfriend. I've known him for nearly 4 years and have shared my life with him for two. I want him back so much, I don't want to imagine my life without him in it. but he has a new girlfriend, he says he still loves me and I believe him. but I messed up, I said I was considering sleeping with some guy on the first date, when in truth I never was, I have never and will never sleep with someone on the first date. anyway now he sees me in a different light, and he was extremely mad at me...I apologized he said he accepted, but I can sense the damage has been done. I am still doing what I need to in hope he comes back. I gain hope and lose it. there are moments when I feel he wants to come back then others where I feel he wants me so far from him. probably why I said something so stupid. Am I wrong, stupid, for holding on, wanting him like I do...whatever the answers I won't give up... my heart is his, because I gave it to him. and I never want it back.

I was with him for two years...had talks of marriage and kids...moving in together and stuff....but i became insecure...(it's a long distance relationship) accused him of cheating when he has never lied to me....he constantly tells me " I love you and I always will" or when I ask if we could ever work again "as long as you change, most likely yeah" I want to change....I'm working on changing...I don't want to move on...my friends tell me that he does really love me and that this is just a phase he has to go through to find out you are the one.....is it true...do you think he will come back... what would you do in this situation...please don't be crude...

20061206101110AA1O0tN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why can't I just forget about this a--h--l and move on?	We were married 9 years. We knew one another 2.5 years before marrying. He left me and the two kids 8 months ago. He has become involved with another woman. He says that nothing went on before he moved. (Yeah, right.) Anyway, why can't I just forget about him? He treated me without respect, was more interested in his buddies or worked all of the time. It is so bad that I wish I didn't have kids so that i can move across the country. Any suggestions people. Thanks for anything that can help here. Everytime I decide that I won't get in touch with him ( exchange the kids at school without seeing one another) he comes up with something that I have to talk with him about., like transfering to another school or the mortgage.  He has admitted to me that he is seeing someone else but tells his friends and family that he is not so it looks like I am insane for not being kind to him. No. I have no interest in being his friend. I need some suggestions or even hope that you do eventually move on.

20070420161716AAHqkni	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She  wants to be friends?	I know this girl named Sara. She is so sweet and so pretty to me. And like 2wks ago I wrote her a note and attrached it to her favorite chocolate sayin I like her. She loved it, and we talked like everyday. Well last Saturday was prom and I couldn't go, so she went with her gay friend. I gave her a rose and apoligized for not taking her, and I find out from my friend (who asked her if we went out) he told me that she can't have boyfriends I kind of figured this because her parents won't let her date alone. Well I told her I want to take it slow. But she said she knows and doesn't want arelationship right now because she is busy. She is busy, you see she use to do drugs like really bad! She has meetings and church, babysittin, chores, errands, tennis practice and matches, and school to juggle. I think she is testin me because she still wants to be friends. I asked her if she was tryna let me down easy, but she insists she still wants to be good friends shes just busy. What do you think?

My ex girlfriend started texting me last nite after about 3 wks apart(1 month 2gether). I asked her 2day if it was just 2 hurt me knowing i still love her. she said no. we kept texting and agreed 2 start over as friends, and c where it goes from there. i WONT ask if she still luvs me(rejection?).

20070424031636AA3NJmf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a chance?	I really love a girl and I have told her my feeling last year; but she said she just wanna be friends. However, since then I have been very nice to her; making her birthday card, standing up for her, helping her out. I also often text her; and she would reply most of the time.      However, there is this another boy after her; during recent school camp he kept approaching her and talked to her. They would chat. I am worried since it is ONE THING that I CANNOT do with her because I am just too scared to talk to her.       So, now her friends tease her about this boy and this morning, a friend of her said the boy's name in a very soft voice towards her and said that she (the friend) would talk something to that boy. I do not know how she feels about him.       This friend of her once teased me by saying that I like her, due to a school publication. I wrote her profile (I am the chief ed.) and wrote all the good stuff. However, the rumour diminish soon, maybe because I never talk to her.

Last night he called me around 4:00 a.m I answered the phone and I heard him say " Baby, I love you" he tells me this alot, and I love him as well. I feel that we share a connection, he lives 4 hours away from me so we commuicate on the phone. Being so use to saying I love you so much I didnt think anything much about it, because I admit that he is confused on alot of thing at this time in his life. These where his actual words " I love you so much, and im sorry just for the things ive done to you, you dont know how much you mean to me, you are such a good woman, i wanna make everything up to u, satisfy u, the way I feel right now makes me want to cry, but you might think im a punk" and I told him i would never think that, then he just broke down and started crying, I was in shock, crying doesnt mean your weak at all, i understand. I called him yesterday at 3 pm and it seem like he didnt want to talk much.

20070507122800AAZNOB2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whay are things changing?	We have been married 3yrs. 2 kids from her previous marriage. Our intimacy has been reduced to 1-2 times a month. She uses the kids to opt out of activities that involve leaving the house. She is resentful of any fun that I have even when she is there with me.(Rare) The last year when she doesn’t want to go I find myself going anyway. I will take one of the kids and go eat dinner or something. We seem to have less and less in common. We are roommates at best. I sometimes feel as if she married me to provide for her kids….. I haven’t stepped out of the covenant of marriage but it enters my mind. I scheduled marriage counseling and went for the single session but I don’t think she made an appointment yet. Do you think I am wasting time?

I have not done what i have always dreamed about yet,  but i am starting to see doors open up for me.       THe timing couldnt be worse though. I just met an amazing perons. A one of a kind. SOmeone you never thought possible because of all the jerks out there.    He is going through growing pains right now too, and wants me to stay around so he can put his life together so we can be stable and happy...tearjerker...but he already said he would wait for me and do whatever it takes in the beginning when i said i am not trying to get in another serious relationship. So now i am just gonna be happy with the time we do spend together.        BUT! I have been thinking alot about my goals and dreams and i have just come across the oppurtunity to do pretty much everything i have wanted.       The Marines or the Airforce as a photo journalist, also known as a Combat Camera.  I have always wanted to be apart of the Airforce...so fascinated with the fighter jets
20070615151122AAkWn3K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Need tips for making a teen long distance relationship work?	Ok so I met a really sweet guy at a homeschool convention. I am 15 (almost 16) and he is 16 going on 17. Yes we're young, but that's not the point. Although the time we were together (in person) was short, we've been emailling and phoning and talking with our parents and we're probably starting a long distance relationship soon. If we do.... we will only get to see each other aabout 4 times a year or so (with youth group camps, etc) plus I can see him when I visit my grandmother because he lives about 20 minutes away from her town. But between seeing each other, I need some tips for keeping things rolling well and us being happy even though we aren't at the same place. Help?

20070618115848AAXZIM8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can a divorce decree be modified to include life insurance?	My ex husband and I were divorced in 2001 and I gave up any rights to his pension or Alimony because I was being harassed by his girlfriend and just didn't want anything to do with that whole mess anymore. The problem that I have is that my ex-husband did not mention his life insurance as an asset nor did he mention his military benefits (BAH, BAS, COLA, Special Pay, etc) as part of his income. Courts don't really know about these benefits so they over look them. I knew nothing about military pay, so I was ignorant to those benefits as well. I didn't care for his money but he did promise me that he would keep our kids as beneficiaries of his life insurance in the event of his death, though it was only a verbal agreement. Well, my ex husband passed away last month & I just found out that he removed our kids from his life insurance policy. Do I have a right to dispute who his life insurance is paid to? Can the divorce decree be modified to include the life insurance? Thanks in advance!

He e-mailed me and asked if I remembered him? Which I did... and then he asked if there'd be a chance we could maybe get together for a reunion/date...well, he lives in a different state. So, he said he would make plans to come here to see me. We have been e-mailing and talking for 2 months now and we have hit it off reaaalllllyyy well. He knows what I look like and I know what he looks like and that's soooo not the issue ( we both think each other is sexy). Our feelings seemed to be eerily parallel until a week or so ago. Now, suddenly, he is getting sketchy and not communicating. Well, he did say "he was overwhelmed by us, and needed time, be patient..." I think he is scared to death of where this might go...what can I do or NOT DO to keep him from running? We both really thought that this was going somewhere special....HELP! PLEASE! Lack of communication and being patient aren't my best virtues.

I dont know about you, but I find myself being a lot more sensitive to things my boyfriend says, given that we're long distance and only see each other on the weekends. It's not that I dont trust him, I just wish I could see him more. He works as a camp counselor and tells me how the girl couselors jump on his back and push him around and stuff just playing around. Normally I wouldnt care, but i find myself getting mad at this. I know it's nothing more than just playing around, but it bothers me. I guess this is normal? Maybe not, I guess I just wish it could be me playing around with him, not them. He tells me "we're just friends" when talking about the girls at work but i'm still jealous. I need to figure out how to not get jealous of stupid stuff like this. I think it's because I just miss him and wish I could see him everyday. When we're together, we barely ever fight, just minor arguments. Help me get over this stupid jealousy!! I love him and I know it gets annoying.

I admit that I felt pressured to make such a decision within only two days. Yes you were right when you said it did not make sense to marry someone at the third time you see them even I have been wondering why we were in rush since I had been always a too selective person. But at the time I accepted your proposal I just felt you were "the knight on the white horse" if you know this tale...   Yes it was a very hard time but I got over this and everything is getting better. I accept your apology and I do forgive you."      The question is: will she accept me back?

The spouse is upset and doesn't speak up because they don't want to lose control and destroy their marriage.  Then when it comes down to it the spouse starts snooping around in the spouses e-mail and chat lines that the spouse is getting on. Now if the spouse finds out what the other is doing and is up set and the other spouse starts acting sorry for what they have done but doesn't speak the words that they will stay off those Video chats and exposing themselves, should the spouse just except the appology???....Is there a time when a spouse makes mistakes that it should be acceptable no matter what???.....Should the spouse always except behavior from their spouse no matter how much you are the one getting hurt in the process, if they are acting like you shouldn't even be upset with it, because they claim it is just for fun for them. Should all mistakes be ecceptable???  If not, which ones are and which ones aren't???      Please Help I need some advise!
20090106132731AAfnJkQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex boyfriend just texted me and said......?	Okay, maybe about a week in a half or so ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. I just wanted to be single, and enjoy life.. Besides, i'm only in 7th grade anyways.        I had my friend call him when me and her were at the mall, and so she called him and said that I just wanted to be friends. So, he's like "Okay."   And then, a few nights after I broke up with him, he texted my friend that I had gone to the mall with and he's like "I was cheating on her anyways.."   So, she told me that.. It kind of hurt.       I wasn't at school today, because I was sick and he just texted me and said "Why did you brake up with me"   I didn't text back, and I don't think I am going to text him back.   And like 50 seconds ago, my friend just texed me and she's like "Brian keeps on asking why you broke up with him."      What does this mean?..   What should I do?   Help, asap. :/

I talk to and see my best friend every day.. and tomorrow morning hes leaving for 2 years to work on long island.  There is no reception or anything so it's pretty much goodbye.   I was so upset before.. crying heaps.     This guy I really like (and he apparently likes me too) was talking to me on msn and I was like "i'm sorry.. i'll brb i need some time to myself im just really upset"   And he's like "wat? why? i don't get you..bye" and he signed off.      I myspace commented him explaining it all...  I just feel really bad.. like I just ruined my chances with him for being an overreacting idiot or something..      How can I feel better?  And was I being an idiot?  Do you think once he hears the explanation he won't think I'm weird anymore?
20081002135659AAjcz0U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I got drunk, guy took a video of me, had sex with me while passed out? I'm only a Sophomore!?	I was at a party last weekend with a some friends last weekend. The friends..Most of them guys except for my friend Katie. Well about 15 minutes after we got to the party Katie had to leave and she left me there with our guy friends. Well, they were giving me crap because I have never drank before and they wanted me to. Well they handed me a shot, and I was like what the heck and I took it..Then they handed me two more and dared me to take them back to back..so I did...I was pretty drunk by then. So then I don't really remember what exactly happened by then just bits and pieces but I remember them getting me to drink more...So I was at the point to where I was so drunk I could hardly stand up. But then the next morning I was in bed with a guy that was with us, I had my shirt off, and my pants. Well I just got up and asked a friend to give me a ride home...So then the next day at school all these guys just laugh as I walk by..I didn't really think anything of it but then at luch a bunch of guys on the football team came up to me and asked if I had a good night and if they could buy the video off of me...By the end of the day I figured out that the guy I woke up with took of video of me drunk and had sex with me whrn I was passed out. It is showing it to the WHOLE school..I am only a sophmore and he is a senior...I am like in tears right now. Idk what to do..and not just the video but I think that I could be pregnant..I've missed my period this week...I am really scared and I know that I shouldn't have drank but I don't think I was asking for this...

20081027231452AAwfcpH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Coworker/married man asked me to go out with him & his wife, yet flirts with me--what is up with that?	He had just flirted with me & then emailed me asking me to come over to his house for a get together with him & his wife, but then when I took him up on it, he backed out immediately?  Why would he do this?  He even said that his wife & I would be joking around like crazy.  I am willing to double date with him, so should I do that to set boundaries?  He asked me to a party with him & his wife previously but then backed out, also.  He flirts with me at work, but not inappropriately, in my opinion.  He emails me a lot, but usually they're innocent emails & I assume his wife doesn't know about the emails.  What is up with this guy?  Is he on the up & up?

Yo me crie en una familia pobre mis padres no se amaban perose apoyaban y siempre mirando a los 5 hijos que no les  faltara nada. No habia la escusa de que  me voy por que no te amo despues de tener hijos; Mas bien, el amor a los hijos Hizo que nosotros llegaramos a ser algo en la vida a pesar de las circunstancias del momento. Ahora estan viejitos y esa complicidad y sacrificio llego a hacerlos inseparables.

J'ai revu mon ex (dej), elle ne voulait pas un soir (motif : "je suis avec qqu'un"), 8 mois après notre rupture, c'est elle qui avait cassé. ?a m'avait étonné, elle est très "autonome", et je voyais pas pourquoi elle pouvait pas un soir, c'était + pratique pour se parkler tranquille, pas le stress de la journée et du "je retourne au boulot".   on a parlé, et quand je lui ai dit "on est resté 2 ans 1/2 ensemble, franchement c'était pas la mort de se voir un soir" elle m'a regardé presque méchamment et m'a dit "je suis avec qqu'un, c'est tout". je précise qu'elle est dépressive, et était salement névrosée pendant notre relation.      2 jours après notre déj elle me rappelle le matin pour me dire "tu as bcp parlé de toi, je voudrais qu'on se revoit, j'ai des trucs à te dire" et me sors "si tu veux on peut diner un soir, sur les champs ou ailleurs". Un peu échaudé, j'ai dit non... "on n'a rien à fêter, alors on dej, mais pas plus".    En fait elle voulait se justifier de son "départ".

20081007115846AAKaPAc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has she given up on the friendship?	She broke the ice by chatting to me, asked for my number and email address, calls me during the week, asks me questions, said we should go out sometime, flirts with me sometimes and smiles when she see's me at work. I've asked her "have you told anyone we swapped numbers?" I've asked her a couple of times to link up. I've even confronted her when i said bye but she didn't reply. She thinks i want more than friendship but i keep telling her i just want to be friends.       Now she's deleted me on msn because she's upset with me. She does give me glances sometimes but she still hasn't replied to my email yet. Last week we both looked at each other for 3 seconds when i was doing faxing. I've given her a week and a couple of days since the email. She hasn't called me for about a month and i'm still deleted on MSN.      Last time i spoke to her i said "What do you think about our friendship?"       I spoke to her on msn last week and we had a little chat. I said "i'm sorry i didn't mean to offend you last week. Can we still be friends?" She said "we are work friends" then we had a chat. Then she said i'll speak to to you later, bye. I sent her a text on Saturday saying "Here's my number if you still want to chat" but she didn't reply. This week she did look at me a few times. When i was speaking to my supervisor dealing with a query she looked over at me and she was chatting to her work mates. I caught her looking at me though but we still haven't chatted for a while.      I sent her this email about 2 weeks ago      Hi      I'm sorry that I gave you the wrong idea and I was not trying to make a move on you because I just want to be friends. I really do value our friendship and I would be upset if it ended.       Can we go back to the way things were and continue our friendship as though I never said anything?       Hope we sort this out soon!      From DJ         What should i do?      Why did she look at me when talking to her work mates?      Do you think she still wants to chat or not?      Help me out plz!   
20090220105239AAhMnFy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He slapped me and now I can't have sex with him, what can I do?	My husband and I have been married 2 and 1/2 years. Up until Tuesday I would consider us extremely close, intimate, loving and very happy. We had a fight about something dumb on Tuesday, and because we're both stressed things escalated, and he ended up slapping me across the face (I hadn't hit him). It was so out of character for him. He's apologized a lot. But I can't be intimate with him anymore (i.e. we haven't had sex since, and we usually do every day), everytime I try I just see him slapping me. He's being very patient, apologetic and attentive. How long am I going to feel this way?  I don't want to have sex with him anymore because of this image I see every time.

C'etait au temps d' la préhistoire   Il y a d' ca deux ou trois mille ans   Vint au monde un etre bizarre   Proche parent de l'Orang-Outang   Debout sur ses pattes de derrière   Vetu d'un slip en peau de bison   Il allait conquérir la terre   C'était l'homme de Cromagnon                      Refrain   l'homme de Cro   L'homme de Ma   L'homme de Gnon   L'homme de Cromagnon pom, pom,   L'homme de Cro de Magnon   Ce n'est pas du bidon   L'homme de Cromagnon , pom,pom.

L'ART   Fuis du plus loin la pointe assassine,   L'esprit cruel et le rire impur,   Qui font pleurer les yeux de l'azur,   Et tout cet ail de basse cuisine!      Prends l'éloquence et tords-lui son cou!   Tu feras bien,en train d'énergie,   De rendre un peu le rime assagie.   Si l'on n'y veille, elle ira jusqu'ou?      O qui dira les torts de la rime?   Quel enfant sourd ou quel nègre fou   Nous a forgé ce bijou d'un sou   Qui sonne creux et faux sous la lime?      De la musique encore et toujours!   Que ton vers soit la chose envolée   Qu'on sent qui fuit d'une ame en allée   Vers d'autres cieux à d'autres amours.      Que ton vers soit la bonne aventure   Eparse au vent crispé du matin   Qui va fleurant la menthe et le thym...   Et tout le reste est littérature      Verlaine.
20071203090757AAEStHA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Afin de démontrer que l'amour se pose n'importe ou en n'importe quel lieu?	A l'église.         Elle était à genoux et montrait son derrière   Dans le recueillement profond de la prière   Pour le mieux contempler j'approchais de son bane   Sous la jupe levée il me sembla si blanc   Que dans le temple vide ou nulle ombre importune   N'apparaissait au loin par le bleu clair de lune   Sans troubler sa ferveur je me fis son amant   Elle priait toujours je per?us vaguement   Qu'elle bénissait Dieu dans le doux crépuscule   Et je n'ai pas trouvé cela si ridicule.      Germain Nouveau  1851/1920  chanté par Pierre Perret.
20071121032140AAyPoyb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Connaissez vous les yeux?	Pour vous rappelez que les vos yeux voient et les autres aussi.                             les yeux,       Bleus ou noirs,tous aimés, tous beaux,   Des yeux sans nombre ont vu l'aurore;   Ils dorment au fond des tombeaux,   Et le soleil se leve encore.       Les nuits plus douces que les jours;   Les étoiles brillent toujours,   Et les yeux sont remplis d'ombre.      Oh ! qu'ils aaient pedu le regard,   Non,non,cela n'est pas possible !   Ils se sont tournés quelque part,   Vers ce qu'on nomme l'invisible;      Et comme las astres penchants   Nous quittent, mais au ciel demeurent,   Les prunelles ont leurs couchants;   Mais il est vrai qu"elles meurent.      Bleus ou noirs,ous aimés tous beaux,   Ouverts à quelque immense aurore,   De l'autre coté des tombeaux   Les yeux qu'on ferme voient encore         "je vais rajouter": ( car la vie continue meme au dela)         ont enchanté des yeux sans nombre

20071015044759AAE0rE2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do men like it if a woman is proactive in starting a relationship?	For example, if a woman invites a male friend to go for lunch, or to a movie in such a way that it is a subtle hint that she likes him? Does this kind of thing make a man feel uncomfortable and in fact turn him off a little? Is it true then that men prefer the chase or are they turned on by a woman who takes the bull by the horns and actively befriends a man she likes, and I mean with very good taste, not cheaply or agressively?
20070903175603AATH2Mm	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need cheering up...?	I have lots of friends. Today is my birthday. All week long at school I was talking about how excited I was to be turning 17 on Monday. But only one of my friends told me Happy Birthday today. I mean, I guess people are busy with Labor Day so that's a good reason right? Even if they are my best friends, being with family is number one. I still think it'd be nice though, just a little call...
20071009211232AAhYulY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i have him do for me?	so this guy that i like told me he'd pick me up and we'd go out and watch a football game with some people we know, but after 20 minutes he never showed up. i called him, and he didnt answer. but a few minutes later he called back and told me he forgot about me. he feels really really horrible, and tells me this every chance he gets. I told him he owes me big time, i just dont know what to tell him he owes me. i was going to have him write me a song, since he sings and plays guitar, but i dont know if thats too personal, seeing as how ive only known him a few months and i dont think we're quite that close yet. even though, i think we both have feelings for each other. so,what do you think? thanks for answering!
20080704221021AAL320K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't feel like playing video games anymore!!?	It's not a terrible thing, it's just...weird. I used to LOVE video games! Now I'm in a relationship with a girl. She said she doesn't really approve of video games, so I thought, "Yeah, whatever. I'll keep playing them, just not around her." But we've been dating for a month now and I just don't even FEEL like playing games! Like, I sit down to play them, but my attention is lost after less than five minutes. Do you think subconsciously I am trying to respect her wishes more than I think I am?      Oh, and don't worry, I AM playing good games: Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Super Smash Bros., etc. Good stuff!      And we're not having sex, and won't until after we get married, if we do. So that would have nothing to do with distracting me from playing video games.

20071223215221AAB5EpK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I act "normal" around my impossible ex-crush?	I goofed and revealed a crush a few months ago. I know that a mutual friend let it slip. I also know that my feelings were not reciprocated.      I have avoided him for as long as I can; but unless I want to start losing friends I will have to be in the same room with this guy for an upcoming party.      My instinct is to just ignore him because that would make me feel most comfortable. But I need to act normal -- whatever that is in this situation. And it's a small party -- no escape.      How do I show that I'm over him without being rude and making everyone else uncomfortable?
20080705020228AAZfIf6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does it make me a bad friend?	My best friend and I are like sisters and am VERY close to her family as well.

I still couldn't find a place, after havig my breakftast I'll spend today and tomorrow morning with looking for apartments and packing. I'm too exhausted and busy with everything, I don't think I can make it to the wedding. I'm sure she'll get mad :-(      Does it make me a bad friend?

Yo recibí una llamada de un amigo quien tenia sus esposa y que producto de esa relación tuvieron un fruto hermoso de ese cari?o tan sincero por parte de el al menos. El trabaja fuera de la ciudad y llegaba a su casa cada 15 días. A su regreso estaba bastante triste, porque su esposa decidió dejar su relación para comenzar otra. Mi amigo estaba bastante apenado en la línea, me decía que seria capaz de perdonarle esa traición, porque la quiere mucho, la piensa todo el tiempo pero ella dice que No. Que le a dejado de querer y le ha dejado de enga?ar y encontró otro amor. Dice que ya no quiere que le abrase, ni un beso suyo y dice que a el le duele mucho.   Vale la pena seguir llorando, que se sienta mal por alguien que no valora sus sentimientos?

20081113153800AAudY1L	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you date somebody with a baby?	well...it's a little more complicated than just having a baby, please read on...I just started dating a guy who has custody of his baby, he is 29 and the mother was much younger and got custody taken away from her because of drugs. Says if he knew who she really was he would have never gotten involved. He is a really good devoted dad. I'm really happy with this guy and I haven't found someone I really liked in a longtime.  I don't mind that he has a baby but should it bother me that he just told me he and the mother had fallen for eachother way too fast and had PLANNED the pregnancy after being together only 4 months?! He's worried that I will think he is crazy now. He is otherwise a responsible, professional stand up kind of guy. I don't even know what to think about all of this now. Is this a red flag or should leave it in the past and continue with him?

We do go to the beach and to the stores, but I wanna go eat once just once a month and go to the movies. He is worried about kids making noise at the movies. It's not really like that. He is just making stupid excuses. He is a cook, his food is the best.    When arguing I win all the time but I just dont wanna be pushy about stuff.

20090220111557AAmyj6X	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP: What should I do?	I'm really worried about my friend. Well she told me that she stopped cutting and I was very happy about that. But yesterday, she was saying that we shouldn't be too close because "something might happen to her". While she was still in her 'cutting phase', she was sort of suicidal and talked about killing herself. But she's also been very sick and something might be wrong with her. I feel that she isn't telling me something. I think she either feels that she might kill herself and doesn't want to hurt me or she has some disease.   I don't want to ask her about this because I think she might take it the wrong way. But I'm still worried. What should I do?

20071020183344AAnmbPZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell a girl that I have a crush on her?	I am friends with this one girl, and I would like for us to be more than just friends.  No, nothing inappropriate; we're Christians.  How do I tell her that I have crush on her?  I mean, I would like to know something to tell her.  It would be best if it could be something short and comical, but that wouldn't make me look like a fool if she said that she didn't want to be anything more than friends.      One complication is that, forgive me, I used to have a crush on her older sister, who already said that she just wanted me as a friend, nothing more. (This took place a couple months ago.)  So, I don't want the girl I have a crush on now to think that I only love her because I loved her sister before.      I really have no idea of how to go about telling her, or if I even should tell her, so you're answer would be appreciated.  Thanks!

20071026075724AAQYnK0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Couple of Problems?	I just quit a band that me and my (now) ex friend were getting together.

When i told him, he smiles and goes" good, i was thinking about kiking you out any way"      So now,, here are my questions.   1. Should I confront him and tell him the reason i quit and argue with him?   2. Should i use my BB gun and snipe at his house to piss him off?   3. Should i get my friend (who he also treats like ****) to help me fight him?      OR      4. Do you have any other suggestions?
20071028173038AAcx11i	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What Should I Do About Her?	Me and this girl were together for almost a year and everything was great and i never saw us breaking up and she said the same, but about 2 months ago we broke up n it was mostly her that wanted it but she never had a reason why other than she quit liking me. And we've been talking and fighting ever since the break up and last week we said that we dont want to see eachother and dont want to talk 2 eachother ever again but i know neither of us really meant it...i think we were really saying we just want some time and space. I could get over her easily because there are many other gurls that are always trying to get with me since i'm single now but i dnt want 2 get over her if there's anything left between us. She says she likes this other guy now but i've seen them together and its nothing special so i think she's just tryin to get to me. Idk what i should do and the only advice i've got is wait a while and quit thinking about her and see what happens, but what i do if nothing happens??

20071113184027AADRsM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best friend/boy help?	okay so me and this boy have been best friends ever since 5th grade (now 7th graders) well we told eachother every little detail, i always went to him for advise and he always came to me, there was not 1 secret we couldn't share! and we dated on and off and after we would break up we might go a week or 2 not talking but we actually ended up being closer friends each time! well it had been about a year and we finally went back out and it was the best relationship ever! i loved him so much(and i dont think it was just middle school crush)! Out of no where he just broke up with me...and he was so confusing!  he was like your the one i want to be with but i just want to be friends and he was calling me the best person ever and calling himself a f*g and stuff but he was breaking up with me!  then he hardly talked to me at all i tried to talk to him about it but it just made him get mad! then i told him he had to make a desicion to either get back to his regular self or stop being my friend.
20071114181943AAaxsb4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Eclipse Q!!!(yay)?	Do you think that Jake has imprinted on Bella?!?!??!?!?! He may not have said because he didn't want to freak Bella out because as Renee says, you can read her like an open book. If she looked worried when she asked if jake had imprinted he would have tried to be as evasive as he could. That could be why jake wouldn't give up, because he can't,,,

Well this guy that i really like, his name is tanner,   he flirts with me an awful lot, and one time i was   texting him and he asked me if i liked him, it took   awhile but in the end i said ya i do. and so i ask   him the same, and he waits awhile and says "well the    truth is i like someone else." and I've dated him before,   a year ago. and he hated me ever since but now   we're starting to be friends. but then he told me he   likes that other girl, and it made me kinda mad.   and he hasnt really replied my text ever since.
20080320194313AA5Wo3Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help.?	Okay, so i like two gus, one named Hunter, and the other named Ryliey. I realllllllllly like both, but Ryliey is moving in like two weeks, and Hunter is like dating some other girl, which is a total bratface by the way, no offense, but it's true. And I'm pretty sure Hunter hates me, like he's all flirty when we talk, but we went out like a year ago, and since he was my first boyfriend, i was realllllllly annoying, and he was flirting with these girls (because he's like the most popular kid in school) and so i told him it's bugging me, and he dumped me. So yeah. what do i do? I like them both so much, it hurts.            Please&&Thanks. =)

20080121065607AABLa4n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make him see me as more than a friend?	I'm totally crushing on my guy friend (original, I know). I thought my best guy friend and I were close...but now that I see how he reacts when he sees our other [girl] friends - which is all smiley and upbeat with hugs even - as opposed to me which is more like a "hey" and just a high five, I feel sad and a bit envious. I'm not bad looking at all, but he definitely doesn't even consider me as anything more than a friend. Any recommendations?
20080207180615AAsHOzd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I too fussy about men?	I'm not looking for the perfect man because I've noticed that it's the little imperfections that make a man attractive to me.  It's just that I need to be weak in the knees and I can't find a guy that makes me weak in the knees often.  It happens about once every 2-3 years for me and I can't settle for just a nice guy in the meantime.  There are plenty of nice guys that want to go on dates but when I think about kissing them I feel like I'm going to be sick.      Does any other female have the same problem?  Or am I just a cold hearted person?
20080209152408AAKgjZD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So theres this guy?	Ok heres how it goes. There is this really cute guy at my school. For the last couple months everyone has been telling me to getover him he doesn't date girls younger then him, so I did. I hadn't though about him at all. Then to nights ago I was at a lockin for my school, he was there.  We hung out tons. At one point my head was on his shoulder(my friends said it looked adorable, lol) and everything was perfect. But then I rememered, he doesn't date girls younger then him, I'm only a year and a half younger. What should I do?
20080211004013AASqtzF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy help please?	One of my best mates knows I like him, a lot, and I really doubt he feels "that way" about me back because he's only acted that way once, when he was being really affectionate when drunk, im almost 99% certain he only wants friendship. but i do know that he cares about me quite a bit, and always hugs me to say bye and tells me to take care etc, and we get on really well, make lots of eye contact when we are talking one on one.       but when in a social group, for example at a mates watching a film, he makes so much eye contact with the others when talking to us as a group, yet only glances at me directly for very brief moments, if at all, and rarely sustains eye contact, its just a glance, then looks away at others in the group- unless i'm the one making a comment. its not like i'm ignoring him either, im the one to always laugh at his jokes even if others dont find it that amusing.    does this mean anything or is it just because im generally the quieter one in our social group?
20080211005558AAm3hEY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help Me I'm So Confuesd!?!?	ok so heres the deal i love this kid.

20080223214145AAcNRuI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women and taken dudes?	Why do women love guys who have girlfriends so much. It seems like when i have a girlfriend I have more girls trying to get with me, and way more options . Even the girls friends are more flirty, and even tried to make a move. It seems to me that women seem to be so jealous of each other. Like i would never hook up with any girl no matter how hot if I even kinda am friends with her BF.       When a guy finds his girl is cheating its always his arch nemisis or some guy he exchanges the evil eye with.      When a girl finds his man cheating its her best GF.      I know there is exceptions to this like everything in the world but this is a generalization which is very true.       Why is this? Why don't women ban together and support each other? So many girls hate Mrs. Clinton cause shes a woman. . . . why?
20080223212824AAv7nMX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a guy stares at you?	well, this just started happening on Thursday I think.

It happened again the next day I sat down & he was staring at me, & one day I was walking & he just happened to glance over & I was there. It's wierd.

I am a man who can admit fault and I didnt marry her in this time. That is my fault bcs. I didnt do it. She dumped me  bcs. she said she didnt think I would ever marry her. She married another guy shortly after and has been married almost one year now. I am still devastated, I thought this girl was my soulmate      Her family and friends all thought she was crazy to dump me and get married so quickly afterwards, but that is the reality. She has called me and written me so many times after her marriage, telling me how she still loves me and is superconfused. I told her not to contact me unless she was divorced. The other day she called with some stupid excuse, I told her I still loved her, and she just got mad and told me that I never did, she was SO ANGRY at me. She then said I have to move on. And SHE was the one who called me. Why is she so angry at me?
20080310202340AAM6ZtG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls find my type attractive?	I always feel like girls aren't into me because of my personality and stuff so kinda here to find out      I'm 17, 18 in 2 months. i am generally seen as quiet, but I'm not really. I act kind of hyper sometimes when I'm with friends but at school not so much. I have a really young face which is kind of annoying because I get told I'm cute by people all the time but not in the good kind of way.      I like to wear band shirts, american apparel, semi-tight jeans. Kind of like the indie look lol.  I do my hair in the bedhead kind of way. Basically spiked all over the place but it's messy.      I am really skinny and people automatically judge me and say i don't eat enough but I just have a ridiculously fast metabolism. I workout so I'm actually pretty strong for my frame.      I dunno I always feel like girls only go for the guys who make all the moves, have huge muscles, etc. I've never had a girlfriend but probably because I've never asked a girl out in the first place. Why don't they ask me instead?!!

I asked this girl that I've been seeing for a month and a half if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said: "no, not yet". She said that she wants to to go out with me on more dates, but now she isn't ready to be officially my girlfriend. I just absolutely adore her, and she said that she likes me back... the interest is definately mutual. However, I definately don't want to bring it up too often because I might seem like i'm pressuring her too much.       Ladies, how long should I wait untill asking her again?

But I have a gut feeling that there is some other reason. Its a long distance affair. He's always too busy to speak on the phone now a days. When I confronted him, he brushed away the topic, saying I was getting 'over emotional'. He hardly ever sends me SMS, and does not find time to chat online too. He was totally different in the beginning, would come running to me. How can I revive the same relationship? How can I get him 'interested' once again?

20080329173336AAUkRCn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Flying across oceans to make love to him...?	We've had a fun, harmless flirting relationship for 10 months. In this time, we've done most things that couples do and he's always the perfect gentlemen, loving and caring. However, I have always restraint myself from giving in to him sexually, but he never pressures me and when i say no, he hugs me to sleep. I figured he would be gone by now if all he wants is sex, cos he's not getting any.   However, I recently got posted to another country. Before I left, I asked him where this whole thing is going, and he said he doesn't feel we have a connection but did not ellaborate. Heartbroken, I left but ever since then, he mails or skypes me every week without fail, just to stay connected (this is not ordinary as he hates all forms of texting, messaging etc).    I'm going back end April because I feel I left it without answers and this time, I'm prepared to go all the way, sexually and emotionally.   Do you guys think his 'no connection' may refer to us never being intimate?

20080331165559AAySRpC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not sure I understand this staring behavior?	So there was someone who came up to a group of me and my friends to talk to one of them, and immediately started staring at me. I caught this out of the corner of my eye, and ignored her for a second or two because I thought she would stop. But she didn't. So I looked over and she held my gaze for what felt like forever. I saw a cup in her hand, so she may or may not have been drunk or buzzed, I honestly have no idea (we were at a dance), and she for sure was staring at me, because there was just a wall behind me. But she knows who I am, and once or twice when we've passed each other in the halls, she's looked at me until she's completed passed me.
20080331171334AAnE9ET	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and i how i feel toward him?	Alright, so i've gone out with him for about 2 months. At first it was cool, you know, and during spring break i would try to talk to him for a bit, but the thing is that he never picked up his phone, so i thought he needed space, so i gave him his space. I didn't call him for the whole last week of spring break. We started school today and i don't  think that we like eachother like we used to. We didn't talk at all today, and I'm not sure if its just that we need time away from eachother or if we need to break up,and if it is that we need to break up i want him to do it cuz i don't wanna hurt him if i break up with him and he still liked me. So im sorta stuck...should i just wait awhile.....i need helpfulful advice. thanks!

20080823202117AAojuPG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hombres sinceramente como interpretar este comportamiento?	Si un hombre te da se?ales de que le gusta, con gestos, te mira a los ojos,con una mirada dulce,disimuladamente con alguna excusa le roza la mano, la saluda sonriente, todo dentro del ámbito laboral, osea no hubo salidas,(aunque no te ve mucho porque los horarios no siempre les coinciden), pero sin decir si quiere amistad o algo mas y no le pide el teléfono o mail para comunicarse.   aunque solo son conocidos y se nota que hay química entre ambos.   teniendo el su pareja, podrá tener realmente interés o lo hace para tener una relación pasajera?   habrá posibilidades de que surga una bonita relación?    sera posible que ya no sienta lo mismo por su mujer y por eso presta atención en otra persona o todo sera un juego?   Porque yo creo que si un hombre en pareja se fija en otra es por que sus sentimientos han cambiado y ya no siente lo mismo por ella.

My two best friends are dating and I'm really worried about what this can do to our friendship. They haven't been dating long and yet me and my bestest friend think that if they break up then they could put our friendship in danger. If they break up and they fight about it they might ask us to choose sides and I don't want to lose either of them. I've been friends with them for quite awhile and I don't think I'm ready for them to date but I want to make them both happy. So does anybody out there know what I should do about the two of them??
20081007111425AA8Iyd4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My mom flirts with my boyfriend?	We've only been together for a few months, but my boyfriend and I are very close already. I'm 34 years old and my mother is 53. She has been living with a man for about two and a half years and they both like to drink a lot. I've had a lot of unsuccessful relationships and my mother has always encouraged me not to settle the way I always have. From the very first time I introduced her to him, she seemed to approve of my choice to be with this man, however she has also  continuously pointed out to me how attractive he is. Recently we had to move in with her temporarily while we are looking for a place and her behaviors around him have really begun to bother me. She looks at him all the time, and when in conversation she seems to have to make a point of letting him know everything they have in cal men. She also has a tendency to try to make me look bad and herself better. Just the other day she pulled out an old album and pointed out all of the pictures of herself that looked the best, not to mention the ones of me that did not look so good.Plus this morning, before he went to work when she thought I was still asleep, she was walking around him with her robe opened and she had a little nightie on underneath, unaware of my presence. She never does that! She's always fussing over him to, like being overly concerned about if he's hungry or tired, as if to try and show me up once again. Even in a room full of people my mom seems to be concerned about only one person. Him. I know my boyfriend only wants to be with me, and he knows I am good to him. The fact of the matter is, I spoil him, but last night when she was practically throwing herself at him and putting me down at the same time it broke my heart. It's like she doesn't care about me at all. I feel as though she is trying to make a connection with him, and steel him from me because he is young and able to take care of her better then the man she is with. He is aware of my feelings, and in fact, last night held me for about five minutes while I was crying over it. I really don't think he has any interest in her, but what hurts me is her obvious interest in him. What can I do?

20081007111826AAicM3w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is unbelievable...please PLEASE read I need HELP!!!!!!!?	I MARRIED THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!!!IM SOOOOO ****** PISSED OFF!! HELP!   In short, my husband and I split about 3 mos ago because he's a selfish jerk. While broken up, he started screwing some *****. He tried to get back JUST ABOUT 2 weeks ago talking about how much he loves me and we should go to church and counseling. I entertained the thought but I knew we had gone through way too much and I couldn't forgive that.    Being the asshole that he is, since he didn't get his way, he cursed me out and told me that he was going to divorce me because she is pregnant anyway. I sent the ***** an email with my phone number to call me because I don't even think she knows we're married. No call.   YES, I KNOW I AM BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.    But Im still in shock.    I did not want to end my marriage before we broke up and I thought we'd get back together. So it has been a big blow.   Today he texts me talking about when am I FILING FOR DIVORCE! I told him he made his bed now lay in it. He COMPLETELY said some pscho **** like "you're probably pregnant yourself because that the only way you'd ever be able to keep a man (WTF!! Im 28 and I have no kids and I've never been or wanted to be pregnant) He said that I'm just mad because she won't call me back (because she a WHORE) and that Im just trying to ruin their relationship and I am mad at her because she has everything I wanted - a baby, a family, and someone to love and who loved me back and HIM, of course. (including some derrogatory words)    I said Good for you! Now go on and file for divorce! Bye! Leave me alone.   Why me God?   Im a mess....it's all being held together by the thinnest string.   How am I ever going to trust and love any one ever again?    I've been drinking more and it's just a ****** up position to be in.   I don't need or want him.....but **** why does he want to hurt me soooo badly?   How do I block it out?? HELP ME GET OVER THIS PLEASE   I want to yell scream cry kick both their asses for doing this to me!!!!!!   It's unbelievable.

They told me.    Then one night we talked on the phone for hours on end and told each other our life stories.       That night Cristian broke up with Maddy.    The next day he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes.       We've been together for a month and 2 weeks.    We've said I love you.

20081028001826AAEO9ai	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	It's been 7 years.. we argue a lot..time to break up?	I KNOW the perfect man doesn't exist. I really care about this guy. He is smart, funny, fun to be around, good with children.. BUT he is bossy, obsessed with money, messy, slightly weird, difficult at times, and very stubborn at times.      I don't know if I am really physically into him anymore either. It's been 7 years and I feel a sense of comfort as does he but there's no excitement, no passion, and a lot of arguing.      is this normal? Is it realistic to expect a relationship with no arguments and with someone who you have no problems with? Should I just "settle" with this guy as he isn't half bad.. and any new guy I meet will also have qualities that I don't like?      I'm really confused.. need advice from someone who's been w someone 7 yrs or longer.. thx

20090218082012AAbDCZ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she wanna bang me?	So there was this chick I use to go out with. We ended things for a reason i'm not going to mention, then I hooked up with someone else. At first we were friends but then she said she couldn't be friends with me as she still and feelings for me. Then for the longest time we weren't even talking to each other. After a while though we starting calling and texting again. I mean She's really fun I enjoy talking to her.      Then she goes and gets a bf. I gotta admit I was a bit jealous but were suppose to be friends so we continued the chats. Then I broke up and I'm single now.       Then we starting chatting one day and this happened:      her: Don't use any lines on me playa, its doesn't work.   me: No point using lines on you ur taken   her: taken? whats that?   me: as in have a bf. Not on the meat market   her: Just cuz I have a bf doesn't mean i'm taken   me: sounds like ur trying to temp me   her: you know me well   me: oh ok, so when we gonna meet up   her: just tempting u who says we gonna meet up?      So the conversation ends somewhere there. Then later she texts me "oh yeah i said i'd meet up with u when ur single right? so see u soon?"      So i'm like confused cuz she's giving me mixed signals. Does she wanna bang me? Or just flirting?

It was worse last year when I was in all of his classes. I am fairly popular and considered "sweet", but this guy and his friends are always making a fool out of me!

SORRY IT'S VERY LONG, BUT PLEASE READ!      PS- His dad is my little sister's principle, and my sis says he does this because he likes me. She says his dad said that! Untrue, right?

20090220164923AAM8Qsm	Family & Relationships;Family	Question about men in general?	Well, long story short, my husband and I had a baby together, and she's now 8 months old. My husband's NEVER fed her, NEVER changed her, NEVER played with her, and he's only held her like 4 times, just because I was busy or something...He's at the gym a lot (10 hours a day 6 days a week) because he's a boxer, and he hangs out with his friends a lot. I know he's not cheating on me, but it makes me feel kind of bad that he doesn't have much interest in his daughter...Are all men like this? I really don't want my daughter to have a bad relation ship with her father growing up.. Does anyone know how I could get my husband to care about his daughter?    Thanks.

20090220145725AAfg8lD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm Thinking She Feels The Same Way, But How Can I Be Sure? Am I Right?	So this girl I really like has been showing the following signs for the past month (they go on and off)   1) Glances (across the room, across the hallway)   2) Walks fairly close to me when we walk to class (close enough to graze my arm/hand)   3) Starting the conversation (sneaks up from behind, even though I know she's there) when we walk.    4) She seems to get her stuff together and leave the classroom at the same time I do.    5) When I text her the conversation will seem at an end, and she'll extend it by saying "I don't know if I should check my math grade", but when I reply to her extension she won't text back.   6) When I'm talking to someone and she's right behind me, she won't say anything. But according to #3 when I'm alone she'll walk up behind me and talk. Today I had to say something to her while I was talking to someone else when this exact thing happened for her to talk.      Now after a mutual friend of ours heard talked to her, the next day the following happened:   1) While outside the car (we carpool because we are next door neighbors) she glanced up at me and back down while she was talking to her sister.   2) While in class, I saw her friend smile and look at her and then me.   3) I called her a slacker (just to tease her because she wasn't doing her normal work outs at the pool) and she smiled and look at me with squinty eyes.       Does she like me as much as I think she does? When I asked our mutual friend what my girl had said, he told me she said "Well, i dont know..."   How can I be sure she likes me without asking her (out)? I have rejection issues, so I just want to be even slightly sure she likes me. Remember: These signs go on and off with her... hmm?

20090220140255AAVLrVD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	LONELY GIRL......what should I do?	This may seem a little pathetic, but I have no friends here in town. Directly after high school I moved to a different city to attend college along with my best friend. Well shortly after moving I found out that my supposed best friend slept with a ex boyfriend while we still dating and also found out that she tried to sleep with another guy while we dated. So we stopped talking and I became really close with my room mate. After graduating I moved back home and my room mate moved back to her city. I only kept in touch with a hand full of people from high school, but most of them are always doing there own thing. I am not into going to clubs, I just like simple fun like the movies, bowling, skating and social eating.....I don't work, and I am earning my masters through a online school, so I have no friends. My boyfriend and I live 2gether and I am trying not to smother him. I purposely stay at my moms house late during the week just 2 give him some "man" time. And usually when he wants to go out on the weekends with his friends I never oppose, even though I really want 2.But 2 night he is going out and I have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do!.......
20090203074625AA1T9YE	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does she mean?.......help me figure it out?

20090220154237AA1xi3V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What could hav happened if i would have just stayed?	Ok so here is the story:   i used to go out with this really nice guy. i mean like really nice and i liked him alot. but after 6months i just decided that i was bored and decided to break up with him for pretty stupid reasons: he called at bad times, always asked me out when i was busy, etc. oh and he was kinda weird but really nice and really funny. So now i liked this guy and i liked him for like a week and then some friends set us up. we have been going out for about 1 1/2 months and i am really tired of him never calling and never asking me to go places and just plain not talking to me not even at school. And now (here's the twisted part) i am doing a play with my EX and i am having so much fun we are talking all the time and he makes me laugh even when i am having a bad day and i think i am starting to like him again. ok so here's the question... what do you all think first and second what do you think i could have happened with my EX/friend?      more details: i see my EX more than my bf and he is not in any the classes that i take and my boyfriend is. i just like being around my EX more than my BF i really don't know.      My ex is one of those ppl that when you went out with them they were nothing special but now he is like OH MY GOD! i would give him an 8 out of 10 in hotness but my BF would get a 5 maybe so if that helps      thanks for your help      :D

He ended up dumping me for my best friend, who instead of standing by me, announced she would rather date him then be my friend.      Recently it seems like wherever i go with my friends i see them together. I cant help it, its not like i have any interest in following the creep i just want him out of my life.

20090203074542AAyL2E7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Some help with this question. Only answer if you have experience with Married couples?	ok, I started hanging out with my friend 8 months ago, just the female ( no names). So lately she is telling her husband to go to the movie with me, she doesn't like the same movies that I like nor her husband. So I went to about 4 movies with him during the day, and hung out. He's a very nice guy. So last friday she called me upset and all. She told me that: her husband don't want her, and she thinks that he going to leave her 4 me, and she told me that she wanted to k i l l herself cause of it.       I understand her past: she was raped, abused, really bad. She is on depression medicine and the sex drive is not there for her.  That I understand. BUT      Why tell him to go out with me if you didn't like it?   I don't like her husband like that first of all.      Should I stop being friends?

20090220141035AARxbY0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was she just being nice?	I talked to a friend whom I had an argument from last year for the first time a couple weeks ago. I felt that I needed to apologize for the way I acted during the beginning of the school year and just catch up since we haven't talked in so long. So I called her up and told her that I wanted to meet up with her so we could talk about it and from what it seemed like she also wanted to talk as well but for some reason I'm not so sure if she's just saying that not to be rude or if she really meant it. Sometimes she says hi to me in school now but sometimes she doesn't. What do you think? This girl is usually nice to everyone which is why it is confusing.
20090220150704AAwCt3i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hung out with a guy last night for about 30 mins he came over......we met offline..and...?	So me and this guy hung out for a little while last night, meeting for the first time. He said he couldn't stay long, and that was fine. He stayed for about 30 mins and he was really funny and had a similar personality to mine.  On his way out he told me to call or text him today but he didn't answer.  After he left we talked a little...and he was like so you don't think Im creepy and I told him no and that I thought he was cute and funny. He told me I was tall and cute. So anyways he didn't respond to my text today..... Is he not that into me...or am I being psycho?
20090220161340AAfqIg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There are these guys who like me. But I don't like them back?	I barely know them.       First guy: I walk across the street to go to school, and he is always there he really likes me. Whenever he says hi to me he gets really nervous, and whenever i sit with my friends he always stares at me. He asked me out and said he liked me and i was really beautiful but i said that I'm muslim and not allowed to date. He is always insisting! I don't like him and I do not find him attractive at all. I try to be nice at times, whenver he says high I say hi back in a friendly way.       2nd guy: I was working on my yearbook assignment, procrastinated until the last minute, he came up to me, asked me for my name, this was in the computer lab, said he seen me around, said I was hot, insisted I check out his web, then he asked me out, when i first met him! WTF? I don't find him that attractive either and he really scares me, and everyday while I am working on my yearbook pages he always talks to me, wants to know stuff about me, and stares at me, like he is right next to me! while I am working. I am very creeped out by both of them. As for why the ugly ones ask me out I don't knOw! Maybe it is because I am always at the library and all the hot guys are popular and date within their circle. I am not allowed to date, I am muslim ( and no i don't wear the headscarf!) and I am very religious. These guys are scaring me and creeping me out. Any ways to get rid of them? What should I say to them next time they pop the question again and again and again!

I like her alot, almost too much considering I have a girlfriend & it's my fault that I didn't tell her that before we started sleeping together but now she does know that I live with someone.      She's been pretty cool but I see it about to become a problem for many reasons (1) because I really like her, so much that I'm finding myself going to her when she wants me just to keep her around, including dipping off from my gf. (2) because when we're out with friends her & I are very touchy feely & people are starting to notice that something is going on between us. (3) because she's starting to act mad recently about me not returning her calls, not telling her where I work or showing up on time.   I expressed this to her in hopes that she'll get the point and ease up on her behavior a little or I may have to ease up on her just to keep the confusion down.

20090220151209AAAdWxe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I "flirt" but let him know I'm not interested?	Okay, so I know my question may not make sense, so let me try to explain.      I'm a very flirty girl, and I tend to hang around guys a lot. I mess with them, and that's kinda my way of having fun.   But today, I overheard one guy talking to the guy I was just "flirting" with, and he was telling him that I had a crush on him. (I do NOT, in fact I have a boyfriend.) And trust me, I know he wasn't kidding. That guy never, (and I mean never!) kids/does sarcasm.      I realize that it's bad to be kinda flirty, but this is just the way I talk, act, and have fun. I do not mean to make my boyfriend jealous, I'm just this way.      How can I still have fun, make sure the the guys know that I don't like them?

20090203075207AAfLhit	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing situation with this girl?	Ok I'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back home. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I liked her but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being fridends but she still avoids me. Then she text me saying she was sorry i got that impression and she loves her b/f but i am confused because she did like all the nonverbal signs that a girl likes a guy and would stare. All I said is that I thought she liked me so wouldnt a normal girl with a strong relationship with her b/f say "I'm sorry I led you on and we can be friends? So why is she avioding me and not talking to me if we agreed on being friends?

A couple years ago we broke up for 5 months and I started having sex with a few different men and I loved it. Ever since then, I dont think I am sexually attracted to him anymore.

I love him and I dont want to hurt him
20090220154321AARa4kS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with this guy?	About five weeks ago, I met this guy at a night club. We found each other attractive (physically) and that was it. All it was was dancing and maybe some future courtship. Therefore, we exchanged numbers at the end of the night. Why is it that I have been calling him some time ago and he never picked up. When I finally text him today asking him if he was avoiding me, he wrote back, "Stop calling me please!" I am confused as to why he would give me his number but not want to be bothered. I was just calling to say "hi" to him. Nothing much.      I hate college men. This is part of the reason why so many college girls are exploring bisexuality/lesbianism!

20090220153731AAr0TFJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I ask her out?	Hiya,   I am trying to figure this whole situation out. Here is how it goes;   I don't hang out with this girl outside of school. We used to be "friends" I guess, but we were never really too close. Lately though, after getting a class together, I decided that I really like her. However, I feel like she is flirting back with me, but am unsure if this is just a "friendly" type of flirt, like she wants to be friends, or a she likes me flirt.      She asked to be my Valentine (On Valentines day though), she shared a seat with me, said I could sit with her when I needed a seat, was offended when I had got something wrong and said that she loved me. (This is where I think it was flirtatious in a friend only matter) She waves at me when I am talking to someone. I feel like she is looking at me during class, now and then, but I can't be confident because I can never really tell or catch her in the act.      What does this sound like to you, a crush for her or just a friendly gesture? If it's a crush, how should I go about asking her out?

20090220154627AAgdKTz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He says we aren't an official couple till we've had sex?	I'm 15 years old and my "boyfriend" is 17 yrs old,and i assumed we were dating nd boyfriend and girlfriend,but i talked to him about it and he said we aren't an official couple till we have sex.Well,i'm a virgin,and i did want to wait till marriage to have sex,but i guess it isn't that big of a deal to not save sex.Plus he said it's a really bad idea to save sex till marriage because guys don't want to wait and want to marry someone with experience.But i really like him and i want to be official with him and i guess what he said about guys not wanting to wait and wanting someone with experience is true,so do you think i should??
20090203075004AAidZIO	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I stay or Should I go?	i'm deciding whether to break up with my boyfriend, who is my daughter's father, who is amazing in many ways and a great father and we have a great loving relationship. we had spent some time broken up (because he cheated and was a lazyass) and i met some great men who are more ambitious, motivated, and compatible personality-wise with me. i am considering this because we are still young, are agreed to be unmarried (marriage is no joke - it's for life if you've forgotten!) and felt pressured to rush back into our relationship. i had a feeling this would happen. i don't want to throw away what is currently a good thing, but it feels incomplete because of rushing back in. maybe i have unfinished business. what are your experiences with this situation?

20090203074333AAy2icJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What went wrong in this relationship, and is it fixable? What if I never find anyone else?	So I'm a senior in college, 21-years old and I'll be graduating in May! yea! I have had some serious struggles with a relationship with this guy who is also graduating in April. We started dating 3 years ago, and it was great at first, but then it went downhill. He cared for a long time, but I was pretty jealous of girls from his past. Girls that tried to break us up immature stuff. I got to be too attached I think. I always doubted his love for me, and he said he never felt like anything was "enough." He was understanding at first, but then it got to the point where he just stopped caring, he said he didn't see the point if I was just going to falsely accuse him of things. I started to cling harder, and then he started to pull away. He would even hang up the phone on me, call me names, and just treat me like I was his pet it felt. He could come and go as he pleased, and if I did something he didn't like he would storm out of my apartment, turn his phone off and block me online. He could never meet me in the middle, everything was always my fault. I was the reason he never had any money, the reason why he drank as much as he did.       We studied abroad together, and it was awful. We fought the whole time, and it was over "nothing" fights. We had soo much jealousy and insecurity, it was ridiculous. I found out while there that he hid the fact that he smoked from me the entire time we were dating. He was up front to me about it as he was balling, telling me that he met someone here that inspired him to tell me. Once we got back he initiated a break for the summer to heal our problems, to help me  I found an email to a girl in our program a few months later saying that she made him realize who he was, and she made him the happiest and he will owe her for everything. I asked him about it, and he said she was just a friend that she made and it was nice talking to her since she was never mad at me, like I was. I started to move on, and he has been "trying" to win me back since September. I haven't been very responsive, and it just seems like he puts the blame on me. He even says well if you can change, then it can work, or if you think we can have something good, then yea that sounds good. It just feels like he doesn't care either way if he has me or not. That's truly what it feels like.      What went wrong in our relationship?  I can admit I was too jealous and clingy, and I did love him. He knews me for who I was and knew me better than anyone else did. I am so terrified that the evil monster that I turned into when I got jealous is going to come out again in my next relationship, and then I drive them away too. I just want a happy and healthy partnernship, but sometimes I feel like I'm too jealous for that, and I caused all of this to happen. What if I get too clingy and annoying again for the next guy? What do you think went through his head? Advice please?

I'm not looking for a relationship or whatever. The real problem is I'm am completely distracted and i can't do any work. My grades are dropping, but i just can't concentrate.

20090220143044AAhucVh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Oh, What A Beautiful Mess :/?	My boyfriend and I have a really fun relationship, there's just one problem.      We go to a small school and have 17 people in our grade. We have a certain girl in class who is always flirting with guys and will do anything to get their attention.      My boyfriend is always staring at her and it really bugs me.      She will also just come up and plop down beside us when we're alone like it's completely normal. He says she's just being friendly and you can tell its a lot more than that.      And in their study hall, she was trash talking me a bit and playing with his hair and clothes and he didn't stop her.      My best friend is in their studyhall and told me afterwards. I talked to him and he said he was going to tell me later but didn't get the chance (there were many chances). I felt really hurt and he said he was sorry and it wouldn't happen again. I asked him why he lets her flirt with him all the time and he said she's not flirting.      What to do without sounding like a crazy jealous ***** (I've already talked to him and not much luck).

20090220155841AAQJWPO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WOW HIS MOTHER is INSANE!!!?	I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, We have a 2 year old daughter together. I am white, he is black. His mom is racist and HATES me. She does not think his daughter is his and refuses to say she is her grand-daughter. She says she doesn't want a white trash child in her house (speaking about our daughter). She calls me a whore and keeps trying to convince my boyfriend to leave me. Our daughter looks exactly like her father. My boyfriend and i have a great relationship and we are a happy family but his mother is causing fights between us. She always calls and says our daughter is not his and our daughter is too ugly to be her sons daughter. This is making it extremely tough. How do i cope with this? This is stressing me out to no end and i ball my eyes out. She has NEVER liked me and always says im a white trash hoe. I just don't understand why she won't except our beautiful baby girl. I've bent over backwards to get her to except me and my daughter but she won't. He does stick up for me and his daughter but his mom always makes him feel bad by saying "you just want me to die don't you!" or "you dont love me!!" and the whole process starts all over. He stopped talking to her for two months due to her treating me and our daughter like she has but then she calls and says " what if i died in those two months, how could you not care if your own mother dies!!" and stuff to that nature and it makes my boyfriend extremely upset because he lost his father 3 1/2 years ago unexpectedly.. I dont know what to do.. Please help?? I love him but his mother is CRAZY! I think her main problem is that i am white because she always makes remarks to her son about me being white. I of course as a mother am trying to keep my daughter away from her and away from the stuff she is saying because she doesn't deserve it.   We are going to get married but as of right now we are a little tight on money and i want to have a big wedding since i have a big family so we are waiting. I have a ring and he asked me to marry him so i guess you could call him my fiancee.

20090220154718AACO1mP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend constantly breaks promises and lets me down-how do I get him to keep his word without leaving him?	For example, I had asked him a few days ago about going bowling with his sister and her boyfriend today and he said yes. Yesterday I was at his house and he started falling asleep at 4 o'clock pm. When I told him not to because he wouldn't want to go bowling because he'd be up all night, he promised me we would go.  I took his word for it (although usually I never believe it), and of course, I get there today-he's been up since 2 am at that point (it was 2 pm) and he decides he doesn't want to go and tried to tell me, even though I have the text, that I asked him to go Saturday, not Friday, and that's what he promised me.  After fighting about it, he fell asleep.  And so, we're not going.  Anytime it comes to the day we're supposed to do something he comes up with some excuse not to, and normally it's either he's tired, or just plain doesn't feel like it.  It's sad that I'm to the point where I am amazed when he actually goes anywhere.  It just sucks because I always get excited throughout the week and am always let down in the end.       We just got back together after I really rough patch and that whole experience was really hard.  I don't want to lose him again (as a boyfriend or him in the sense of how he usually is with me as opposed to who he became right before and during the break up) and I want our relationship to build and become stronger.  How do I deal with his letting me down and just plain laziness without leaving him?

20090220143346AArKzvw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(Long but interesting 10 points for best answer) She says I push her away, and now shes pushing me awaying?	Alright I really don't get my girlfriend at all and its bugs me because I am very attracted to her, and I love her personality when she actually opens up to me. I have fallen for her, and she has loved for me for quite sometime as she had a huge crush on me.      I am 19 and shes 16 I know that may sound weird to some but its legal here. And when I met her I was 18 and she was 16 and I actually thought she was 18 as well or at least 17 because she looks older for her age.      Anyway I don't need to explain the whole story of our relationship it would be to long even we have only known each other for a few months. So this what happened the first time. She told me she was going to the movies so I went out to the bar. The whole time she was worried about me, and telling me not to get to drunk and all this.      So I didn't text her that much that night because I was kind of pissed that she was acting like she didn't trust me. I basically poured my heart out to her, and she still thinks I might cheat because she got trust issues. So that night I didn't respond to one of her texts quick enough and she got all emotional and said I guess you got to drunk and forgot about me.      So I tried to explain the situation and everything to her was bs. And she was saying I can't do this (which I later found out is she is considering breaking up with me). So that night again I find myself pouring my heart out again, trying to convince her how I much I love her and I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.      She told me every time she tries to care about me, I push her away. And I'm thinking if you care about me and trust me so much why does think I'm going to hurt her.      Anyway I'm sick of rambling on here. So basically I told her that I was going to be more caring towards her and I want the same towards me. So basically I'm like a lovey dovey guy who says all the right things, makes her feel extremely comfortable and it worked or at least I thought.      She was talking about our future together, and how she can't wait to move in with me and live happily ever after. Instead of doing what most people do our age, often times we just hang out and have family nights with her family. Which is cool it shows me how me she wants me around, and to get along with her family.      But then this is where it blows up on me. Now I think I'm getting clingy and lately the only thing she likes to talk about is sex and when we can have sex. And she wants me to talk dirty to her which is all sweet but isn't there more to this.      Today she has been acting weird all day. She hates when I don't text her, but for like the first time ever she says nothing. And whenever I text her, comments come way later for some reason. I don't know what to talk about because she blew me off for a party tonight with her girlfriends. I'm fine with that, its cool friends are important. I told her I would go to a bar.      Once again here we go again, she says don't act stupid tonight. Be a good boy or else. I asked a similar question today and someone said she might be taking me for granted because she knows I'm going to be there for her, whenever she wants me. But then again why is she so freaking insecure when I go out drinking I have never cheated her, I have never cheated on a girl in my life.      Please somebody help, lots of answers would be appreciated.
20090220143040AAKXbzU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should we take this?	Me and my ex broke up a year ago because i wasn't ready for sex. Now a year later we started talking again and since then i've lost my virginity. We talked for a couple days STRAIGHT and he asked me out again and i said yes. He asked me out over a text which kinda pisses me off and i haven't seen him SINCE he asked me out (he's visiting his grandma and comes home today) How should we take things? Slowly? I kno i'm kinda stupid for saying yes right away so don't make stupid comments plz and ty :]

20090220143515AA7HxPr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with me?!?	there is a guy who i have been dating for a while.   last time i asked question here,   i was like i don't think that i like him so much, but i keep thinking about him...   people think that i just like him as a best friend, but not a lover...   however... if i do like him as a best friend, why he could affect my mood so much?!   i can be either so happy or so upset because of him...      what's wrong with me? what should i do?!
20090203074307AAuoFw4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my best guy friend playing "love" head games?	To start, let me give you some background on the situation.    My best guy friend, Devon, has been a HUGE crush of mine since the moment I saw him the first day of my freshman year. I REALLY liked him, but he went out with one of our best friends, so I backed off and moved on.    This past summer, he told me that he loved me and has always loved me. I decided to give him a chance and I broke up with my boyfriend. Right after I did that, Devon told me that he didn't want to ruin our friendship over this.    Well, I stayed single for 3 months, waiting to give him a chance and finally went crawling back to my boyfriend who (luckily) took me back.    Devon has been declaring his love/like for me ever since. At least once a month we will be talking about something and he will just hint around the fact that he likes me....   Also, Devon has this weird power over me and he can pretty much make me do anything...   Well, last night we were talking on AIM. He knows how much of an Edward Cullen (from Twilight) fan I am. We were back and forth quoting Twilight when I brought up the kissing scene. He asked me "wow am i gunna have to ice my lips before i kiss you to turn u on". I said who said you would ever get to kiss me?   He said "I'm Edward Cullen...don't believe me? look at the facts: i always keep you at arms length, i am always cold, i dont like the sun and i have a power over you that can make you do anything..."   I told him to "move to Washington to find [your] Bella" He told me that he already found her and sent me a heart.    I am pretty sure he is playing mind games, and that is what everyone says, but I can't stay away.    Please help!
20090220144521AAI3Gtd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong for not wanting to play the wife role when I'm only his girlfriend?	My boyfriend of a year and a half do not live together he wants me to cook for him everyday, wash his clothes, and get a savings account together.      He is really irresponsible w/ his money and he has no intentions of at least handling his own business when it comes to stuff like that.      I don't like to let him borrow money b/c he says he will never owe me b/c what's mine is his and his is mine.      I'd understand if we were married but were not and what if we break up?      I'm not in the business of pretending.          What should i do?

20090220144724AA1ABlS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I aproach a myspace friend about the fact that I might be developing real feelings for him? :/?	I am moving to another country to start a new life. After much deception and  a lot of set backs, financially, emocionaly, after almost reaching the bottom and then picking myself up, I have now set myself on the course to make all of my dreams come true. I am hunting for my dreams, and relocating to half away around the world to do what I love is one of them and might just happen this year, if only I am persistant and brave the enough, wich I know I am.      Point is, someone showed up, someone who lives in the country to wich I am going to relocate (same city and all), and someone who seems very much wordy of me starting to believe again. Someone who made me understand that I do deserve a second chance on life. I want to make this guy my boyfriend, and not only because I might be starting to fall for him (in a very platonic way nevertheless); but also because I feel like after all I have been through in the last few years of my life I deserve this, to be given the chance to be happy with someone and to make that someone happy to.      We're at a miles distance, and all we can do is platonic for now, but something tells me this man could be special. I don't want to hurt it tho, our friendship!! So how do I let him know that I want him without exposing myself too much or make him feel pressured into anything?      I tried to be light hearted about this and even though about letting him go, and just pretend that I wasn't starting to have feelings for him, since I am the one I should be focussing on now, but then it occured to me how unforgivable to myself to give what could be a new opportunity away!!! I mean God doesn't put people for you to fall in love with in front of you every day!      Funny thing is I never was into internet stuff! Used to make fun of it actually and to find it terribly lame. It started only now with this guy, and ever since I got hurt. It just made me avoid dating life, and search refuge in other things lol ... and now there's this man, and I am relocating to his city! lol      I don't want to repeat past mistakes tho! Can anyone be of any help?      Thank you!

20090220144220AA7Hwsd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just kinda need some advice i guess?	ok so im 18 a college freshman, and just got off my winter break about a month ago.  Over break I met this girl I fell head over heels for really hard.   I have never felt this way for someone so quickly.  We started dating, and it was awesome, but just two weeks after i came back to school she told me she can't be in a relationship right now. (which if you know whats going on in her life is completely understandable)  Still kinda sucks and I still love her.  (again weird i know after such a short time i just can't explain it)  Now she claims that she never really felt love for me but she thought she did.  Kissing her makes me feel a way i never have and i can tell it does the same to her.  I saw such a glow in her eyes when we would kiss or even just cuddle and talk.  She is at my home and im 2.5 hours away at my school and i understand now is not a goof time for her for a relationship.    But do you think she feels for me the way i do her and just wants to make this easier, or do you think she really doesn't feel for me the way i do for her.   She kissed me first, she said I love you first (and after only one week) and she was amazing.  I still talk to her ll the time and am cool being friends for now, but I still want her as an option for my future.    Does she love me?

20090220141008AAyDy3p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I feel like this?	I've only really had one proper relationship. It was really serious and lasted a long time. It was up and down a lot and I was really hurt when we broke up for the last time, just over a year ago. It was a long distance thing for most of the time, but we really loved each other. Since then only one person has even looked my way and I haven't had any real feelings for anyone. Every guy I meet I end up comparing to my ex, but I definitely don't love him any more. It's starting to worry me. I don't want to sound like a whining teenager, but I don't know if it's normal to feel like this..

20090220141103AA8tJyQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He threatens to break up....?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for five months.  I love him very much.  When I first met him he was such a commitment-phobe. He was chasing women and sleeping around. He said he needed something more stable.      We started dating.  At least once a month he has a conversation with me about how he's not sure that he can handle this relationship.  How he is probably better off being single. That I am too good for him. That he is still sexually attracted to other women... etc.      My reply is always that I love him very much and that I am not willing to give up on him.  I tell him that I want him in my life.  He comes from a background of a very dysfunctional family mother who could care less, abusive father, people always giving up on him.      After we talk it out he is okay, but I am getting really tired of these threats of leaving me.  He says he doesn't mean to but he tries to push me away on purpose to make sure I really love him and that I wont leave him.      I told him I couldn't put up with feeling like our relationship is in jeopardy every month, and that he needed to stop playing head games with me because there is only so much I can put up with before I will decide to leave. He said he was sorry and that he would try hard.      Guess what? He had the conversation with me again today, just in different terms than normal. I love him so much when he's not acting like this. I don't know what to do :(

20090220141444AAVtLXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend/Porn Disagreement: GUYS advice welcome too?	I've been seeing my boyfriend for awhile now, and things are going great and we've looked at rings and are picking out a place, so everything is moving along great. He's a terrific sweet loving man and I adore him.      But theres one issue Im having problems with. He'd really like us to watch porn together. I have no moral issue with porn (hell, we made one of our own) but watching other people do it just isnt my thing. He says it'd be a good educational experience and would be hot.       My big issue with it is it makes me feel like Im not sexy enough or our sex life isnt hot enough to get him turned on on its own. I've voiced this to him multiple times and he says Im interpreting his desire to watch it with me incorrectly. Im not sure how else to take it. Im also irritated because a few weeks ago this came up and I asked if he was watching it anymore and he said no. Then today hes like "sorry babe I am I guy and I do watch it". When I asked why he told me he wasnt watching it anymore he said "well at the time you asked I wasnt". Caught me on a technicality.      Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Any advice? The whole thing just makes me feel very unsexy and un-needed
20090220155506AATeN4k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How much of a coincidence is this?	My boyfriend, who I have met this year, is a lot alike me. We have a bit of the same personality, and we are both very good at school (math and science specifically), and liked by most of the teachers. We love the same music, and he also loves Harry Potter, the books I am obsessed with. We both changed our styles around the same time, naturally. Today, I just discovered his mother shares the same birthday as my mother, as well as, we all (his mom, my mom, and me) share the same middle name. My friends have poked fun of this, saying it is "meant to be." Great coincidence, is it?

I have lived across the street from this guy Pete since I was in kindergarten. We are both seniors in high school now and he is one of my best friends. But over the past few months I have noticed that there is an attraction between us, and that I have feelings for him.      We spend a lot of time alone together, and every time we hug or touch I get the strong feeling that one of these days we're just going to explode and start passionately making out. A lot of our friends have told us that we would be cute together, or we should date. Pete is cute and funny and I know he likes me too.      But I also have a boyfriend, Kevin, who is a year older than me and in college. We have been dating for over a year. He is a great guy and treats me like gold. I love him but I'm starting to realize that I'm ready for the relationship to be over.      What should I do? How do we go from being best friends to bf/gf? Should I risk throwing away my relationship with Kevin for Pete? or should I even risk my friendship with Pete in the first place? HELP

20090220153206AAyEgb3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How deeply in love is a guy when he...?	This may sound like a dumb question, but on a serious note, from a scale of 1 to 10 is a guy deeply in love with you if:      1) wants to plan his whole life with you.   2) sees you as his future wife.   3) imagines the two of you in "both" of your dream house and with two children of your own.   4)no matter how many times you get down about your relationship with him, he still helps you back on your feet no matter if he knows how you feel is wrong but still makes you feel good.   5) wants to marry you      I'm just asking. honest answers.
20090220151125AAxNtJy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i act like this?	i hate that I seem to plan things in my life, according to when I might be able to see him...      i don't want to be dependent on him to be happy... its just I really enjoy spending time with him, and since our time together is somewhat limited, I feel as though I have to 'plan' or (over)think about doing things because they might interfere with the chance that we could be hanging out instead...      I know I just need to relax, but I'm afraid to become obsessed... I know I need to be more independent, but I can't help but to think that I'm 'missing out'... ya know?      what to do?

20090220142236AA6jg6W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Short Read:Which guy would you say like me?	I need help trying to figure out which one of these guys like me:   Guy #1-Ask about me through other people, for example, my immediate co-worker,through another manager-he asks"So how is so and so doing", everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else.He's also called up to my job three times asking for my whereabouts and claiming that he wanted to meet me, but never showed. Told me to call him anytime.Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there.   Guy#2   Mostly talks to him over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that".Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.Another thing is the few times I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers..and he hangs up.The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George  has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.   Sidenote"These two guys are very good friends..:)

So when we went over there he was like "I was waiting for you to come see me, i was really pumped when i heard you were coming!" He then flashed me a dazzling smile, like always! So we talked for like 15 minutes. Later though, i saw him talking to another girl and he flashed her the same smile. Then i saw them kiss! Then he came right back to me and completly ignored her for the rest of the night! I can't tell if he likes me!

20090220143354AANpVuM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP!! is he thinking of me?	my boyfriend broke up with me about 2 and a half weeks ago. we went a few days without talking at all then he texted me and told me he missed me and loved me. Then we talked off and on for about a week or so. During that time it was obvious that we love each other. Then on Tuesday he told me that he shouldn't have started talking to me again so I said ok i understand and that I was sorry for talking to him too. Then a few hours later that night he texted me and asked if it would be ok if he called me and I told him yes. Then, he never called. So I texted him and told him not to talk to me anymore unless he wants to get back together with me. Right now he's confused because he knows he loves me but we're long distance right now so it's hard. So I told him that if he misses me and loves me and he just wants to talk to me because of that not to talk to me cause it just gives me false hope. well that was three days ago and he hasn't talked to me and I'm scared he is starting to move on. Do you think he is or is he just still confused? Will he text me soon? I know ya'll don't know exactly what he's thinking, but by the info i've given what would you guess? i'm bad at analyzing things so thanks for the help!

20090220155847AAXjR8d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me and how do you know if someone likes you?	Well i love this guy so much and he doesn't know it (i hope). He always touches me like teases me, blows on my arm, gives me these hot sexy looks, and always finds something to say so i can give a comeback. But my question is how do i know when a guy likes me??I'm very blind in these types of things.

20090220161056AAYIj95	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this is strange?? Is he hiding something?	My boyfriend, Chase, and I have been dating for a few months now. He is the best guy I have ever met, but....      1. His best friend is a girl named Meredith. They are together ALL the time. I don't have a problem with it because they have been best friends since pre-school and they are Seniors now. I just think it's weird because he never tells me when he is with her or his other "girl" friends...He didn't even tell me he was taking Meredith to the Prom. (because I'm not old enough to go, I'm just a Freshman) He tries to hide it when really, I don't care...It just makes me wonder because..      2. Girls text him and myspace him all the time.. When we are on myspace together, other girls that I have never seen before in my life message him and say "hey my sweetie" or "there's my baby". He always deletes them thinking I didn't get a chance to read them and then he says "I have no idea who these girls are.. I hate it when they do that."      Is that WEIRD or is he just popular? Hmm..      plus---I'm not the jealous type at all! I'm just wondering... :)
20090220161744AAZTB6Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does my best friend hate me?	Hmmm.... where do I start? I am a twin. She is the exact opposite of me and we don't really share much. Exept for one thing... friends. I have two best friends, Allie and Noelle. They mean the world to me, but they're my sister's best friends too. This has never been a problem... until now. Noelle and my sister have started to hang out with each other more and more. But that was months ago. But now Noelle is at my house almost every day, but, she never talks to me. She is always with Megan (my sis). Whenever I ask if I can be with them too... Megan just yells at me. But, luckily, Allie is as close as ever. She has been eexcluded by Noelle as much as me, because she's always with Megan. Whenever I call I get excuses. It even gets so bad, that whenever Noelle is over, I go to Allie's house. We're all neighbors. Sometimes, when Allie talks to Noelle, Noelle will say she has a huge test to study for. An hour later, she's at the movies with Megan. Once, I finally got her to come and hang out with have a sleepover. IT was really special. Megan got mad because I told her to leave us alone (the hypocrite). Then we got into a small fight. Noelle went into another room with Megan for a few minutes. Then, she left saying that she couldn't stand our fighting. The next day, she calls Megan to go ice skating and dosen't invite me. Then, Megan spends the night at her house! Yesterday, Noelle was at my house again but I was studying. I have been so sick of this fight or whatever it's called, that I got up the nerve to do somehting. I asked Noele if I could talk to her, and i told her that i didn't want to be her friend anymore. We've been BFFs since first grade. But, a few minutes later I heard Noelle and Megan laughing and having fun. It was as if SHE DIDN"T CARE. After, i sobbed on the phone with Allie for about fifteen minutes. Shes as mad as i am. So, today i couldnt stop thinking about it. So, I called Noelle to talk about it and tell her how i feel. Then, she called me a hypocrite and that she's hung out with me tons of times and that i'm just jelous that i couldnt hang out with them yesterday. Now i dont know what to do.... PLEASE HELP ME! I"M SO DEPRESSED!

20090220141434AAvuMnR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Feeling lonely in new relationship?	I met a guy online we talked over the internet for months and we fell in love and I moved from another state to be with him.  He has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so he is often too tired and sick feeling to spend time with me.  I have been here 3 weeks and I am lucky if I see him once or twice a week for about an hour or two. He says he loves me very much and even wants to marry me but I am often feeling lonely since I moved here.  He makes plans with me often but then ends up not feeling good and cancelling our plans which leaves me disappointed.  If I try to talk to him about spending more time with me he gets upset and says I cannot handle his illness, I am not sure what to do, I love him very much and want to be with him, should I just be patient with him?

20090220143503AAjBALl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get people to like me?	I’m a second year at university. I know lots of people and from what I gather they don’t dislike me. When I do go out I see many people who I know and they stop and talk to me. If I’m lucky enough to take a girl out on a date they often comment on how popular I am. However, this is not the case. Although I know these people none of them go out of their way and invite me out or try and spend time with me. I get contact details like numbers and facebook adds but when I ask them if their going out or if their up for hanging out they either reply with “I’m really busy” or they don’t reply at all. The same thing happens with girls, they show a little in Interest and then they just cut me off. I have one really good friend who I spend a lot of time with, we both have the same interest of becoming doctors and I must admit we are a bit geekish. However, when I’m out I try to contain my passion for science. I do other stuff as well, I’ve climbed mountains and backpacked many countries including the USA, I’ve been involved with politics, me and my friend have both been independently published, I like skiing, sailing, I can play the violin, piano and guitar and I’m only 19 years of age (I don’t like bragging but I’m trying to put across the fact that I’m not boring and I have a lot of things to talk about)     I must be doing something wrong but I can’t find out what it is, please could someone help me?

Then we broke up and are now back together.    We've been dating for about two weeks now since the break up four months ago.    We broke up because we didn't see each other for like a month and we were arguing a lot and he just got so mad and broke up with me.    So now that we are dating again, and we actually see each other more, how do I make sure he won't lose interest in me?    And what are some questions I can ask him for the 20 questions game?   Btw, I'm 14 and he's 13. Thanksss :)

20090220151404AArnkCX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my girlfriend still have feelings for her ex?	Ok my girlfriend and I began talking about 5 1/2 months ago.  When we first became friends she was "talking" to a guy.  I learned that he was cheating on her so i told her.  She confronted him and they pretty much went their seperate ways.  This was not the first time he had cheated on her. When he had the first time she had taken him back.  She would make comments to me before we were dating that he didn't even care...like if he did she would go back to him.  Well now we're dating and i'm worried that she still has feelings for him.  She says she doesn't and that even the feelings she did have for him weren't as strong as they are for me.  however she lost her virginity to this guy and i have always heard that a girl has a special place in her heart for the guy she lost her virginity to.  I want to believe her that she doesn't have feelings for him, but she has poems she has written about him (good and bad) posted on facebook.  I have choosen to save myself for marriage and she has no problem with that, but i wonder if she could really feel more for me than she did him if she has never physically connected with me.  I also thought i might have been a rebound considering she told me she had feelings for me about 3 weeks after they ended things.  I just want to know if i should believe her when she tells me she has no feelings for him and doesn't ever even think about him?  I want to because i care for this girl with all my heart....I just don't want to be the runner up prize or rebound...any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

Neither of her parents are mixed.
20090220152639AA71SD8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rebelling against life? (please answer. 10 points)?	My best friend is 17 and a senior in a private high school. Shes beautiful, popular and the president of our year. Shes dated the quarterback of the football team and the best swimmer in the school. Last year she started hanging out with this girl and her friends from a public school and I told her that I thought the girl had a crush on her and my friend admitted to me that she was gay and had a crush on the girl. The two of them started dating a little while later. I dont care that shes gay, but I feel like the other girl made her gay. I don't get how she could go from dating "rich cute guys" to dating a public school girl. She never slept with any of her boyfriends, but after dating this girl for about 9-10 months she slept with her.

20090220154418AAd2Gd8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I react to my girlfriend?	Here's the scoop...My GF of 2 months has a 14 year old daughter. Her daughter recently had sex with a boy 2 years older than her.       My GF is happy that her daughter felt that she could speak to her about it.       Anyhow, so this happened recently and today my GF took her daughter out for a day of shopping and pedicures, etc.       To me it felt like she was rewarding her daughter for lying and disrespecting her. I am emotionally confused by all this and don't know what to do or how to react.       My GF and I have very good communication skills as we can tell each other everything.       When I originally found out about her daughter having sex under the guise of "spending the night at her friend's house"..I got upset and we talked about it.        Help me out with some advice. I feel as if her daughter should somehow be punished yet her mother keeps letting her daughter "spend the night" at her girlfriend's house and letting her daughter do whatever she wants.

Okay so there is this guy at school who I'm like really interested in    and I can't get him to notice or talk to me. I know hes probably not interested in me because i already had my friend tell him that i think hes cute. Hes single and I've never been rejected i usually have guys begging me to go out with them(not that I'm trying to be cocky or anything)    so why is he so disinterested?
20090220160156AArZ01f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do taurus men usually take long to forgive and do they forgive at all?	I usually don't go by zodiac signs but the person in reference matches all the attributes of a taurus very well. The thing is i really love the guy and he has not spoken to me since the end of December. He has not told me what exactly I have done either, i can only guess and i've come to the conclusion that it has something to do with the emails i sent him saying i love him, i miss him etc after i had not spoken to him in a  week(i may have shouted in the emails, and come off as too attached/clingy ) cant help that as  we are in a long distance relationship.The only contact i've had with him is via his brother online when i ask him if his brother is ok.I'm holding on for forgiveness, but its been 2 months and no contact, i sent emails saying im sorry for shouting at him, but i get nothing in return. The thing with him is he is a very sensitive guy u have to be careful with what you say to him etc. And so i ask am i being foolish or is there a possibility he'll forgive me.
20090220160418AASBpvJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me as much as I like him?	I'm really falling for my guy friend. But i don't want to do anything too extreme because if he doesn't like me i don't want to ruin the relationship. We're pretty good friends, we talk a lot in school, and online. And we tease each other a lot, we have inside jokes and he frequently compliments me on even the smallest achievements. He pokes me and tries to get my attention and make me laugh. I've been going through some hard times lately, and he got all concerned when i responded negatively when he asked how i was (which he asks almost everyday). He listened and he was really supportive and when i sent him a comment on facebook the other day, he quickly started iming me, asking me how i was and if things were getting better. Which i thought was sweet, because he was considerate enough to continue the conversation privately instead of out in the open. He said i'd be in his prayers and was disappointed when i didn't have the same class as him. And i realize that this is a lot for a guy to do for a girl he rarely sees outside of school and isn't best friends with. But he is a really nice guy, he's nice to everyone and he's very liked because of it. All the girls want him, and i swear he could date almost any girl he wanted. It makes me wonder though, would most guys care this much, or even notice something was wrong unless they particularly liked a girl? Do you think he likes me? I'm really falling hard for him, what do i do???
20090220160550AAUDpqJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask someone out?	I've never dated anyone and there's this girl I like. She's my friend.

I've been single for a while now and I love it, but lots of my friends have been dating recently (I don't want to date her because they are dating other people, it's just a coincidence) and I'm afraid I'll be awkward with her. We won't have premarital sex though. That's definitely a no-no between us. It's not necessary since I respect her. I'm also nervous too because I don't know what my family will think. My aunt, dad, and other people of the Asian community might not approve of me not dating an Asian even if I don't care for their opinion. It's just annoying to hear them go on about that crap. I'm sort of scared of heart break. I don't know what it's like. When I do get the nerves to ask her out, what should I say?.

20090220161951AAsZ0Q9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He loves me, but won't be with me?	I was in a relationship for 3 years. He cheated, and I broke up with him. He’d always try to contact me after, but I restrained myself from contacting back because my feelings for him never went away. I started dating someone else for half a year, and that guy turned out to be an abusive jerk. When he left, I felt depressed and called my ex. When we talked, it was obvious the feelings were still there. He told me that he's been waiting for the day I’d talk to him again, that he misses me and all. We hung out with each other once after that and it was really nice being with him again; when he took me home he held me for a long time and told me he didn't want to leave and it looked like he was about to cry.      Yet, the following days he made no effort to talk to me. I was upset and confronted him about how he can act like he still loves me one day, and the next he acts like we're strangers. He tells me that he loves me and wants to be with me, but he can't because he feels that he needs to grow up, doesn't trust himself and can't hurt me again. I don't know what to think of that. I love him so much, but I honestly can't just be friends with him; and he knows it too.      I don't know what to do. Wait for him to "grow up" because I truly still love him and he supposedly loves me too, or just stop waiting and completely remove him from my life because this seems to be heading no where?

20090220164630AAOnZVb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Get My Crush To Like Me? (read)?	Ok there is this boy in one of my classes and I think that hes so cute! I even wrote a song about him. Im not obsessed over him because I just realized that I like him a couple of days ago and I dont know what to do!He is so otgoing anyways to the problom. His name is Wayne. Wayne dosen treat me lke the other girls in the class. I know that I am the hottest girl in that class because there is only 11 students and all of the other girls are drop dead ugly! His best friend Timmy always laughs at my jokes, is my partner in that class, and everyhing by Wayne dosent! Before class Wayne plays around with Mary and he puts his hands on her but not in a sexual way or anything. Mary told me that she dosent like him but I'm not sure if Wayne likes her or not. Nobody knows that I have a crush on Wayne. Wayne dosent treat me like the other girls in this class. The only girls he talks to are me and Mary. Me rarley! The few times that I have actualy had a conversation with Wayne and when I say confersation I mean like 40 second word exchange, he does pay attention to what I said and does not joke like he would If he were talking to Mary. I think that he just feals more comfterble with Mary then he does with me. We wear unifroms so I dress up as much as the dress code allows, I act confident, I loot pretty, I act girly and funny all at the same time and he still dosent look the least interested in me. WHY!  I don't want to make it obvious that im totaly in to him because what if he is not into me? What do you think I should do to mak me and him talk more and how do I get him to like me and how do I know if he likes me?

20090220164713AAwMI3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if a guy talks dirty to you?	My best guy friend has been doing it a lot lately. Like inappropriate convos and topics. Yesterday when we were talking, he said he was bored and was having an erection. There were many other dirty convos like this. He is never too inappropriate with me, but just in general more so. He's a really nice guy, but why is he being so dirty lately? We've been best friends for 3 years. In fact, he just got a girlfriend 3 months ago. Ever since then, he has been talking dirtier. I always kinda liked him, and when he started dating this other girl, it really sucked. But I just don't know what his behavior means...

I work part time in a bar and live a commercial life. THING IS... I am trapped inside a life that I shouldnt be living.

Does not pay rent, car note, or even for his own food. Can't hold on to a job and is only 22. I understand putting him down  won't help but she was busy demeaning me for not wanting my husband to take him out till 3 am when he had to work at 7. My hubby didn't think it was right either. So do I apologize for insulting her?
20090203074640AAyAcZW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I asked him to marry me but he needs to think about it.?	April makes our 5 yr anniversary, we have a 3 yr son. We have been living together for 4 1/2 years. I have been married so, i know how serious this is, he has never been married or in a serious relationship. He has mentioned several times that I am the one but wants to ask me when he is financially more set. I have explained I don't want a huge ring or wedding but he insists on at least getting me a really nice ring. I popped the question yesterday and he said he had to think about it. Now I wonder if I did the wrong thing or if i did it too soon. We have not done anything by the book so, I figured why do this by the book?! If you really want something you go for it or else you will always be thinking "what if". BTW, he is 29 and I am 23.

But, his family is just crazy. They have never liked me, never accepted me in! My biggest problem would be his brother. He has always tried to be in the middle of everything and just caused more problems than what is needed. Now, he is married and Me, the wife and the brother were fighting and now they have decided that I am not apart of their family. So, now the rest of the family except the dad followed suit. Can a marriage survive and be happy with this hole in the middle?? Because there is no way this will be repaired we are all done with each other! So, how does a marriage continue when the spouses family disowns them? And how can we make sure that we don't let this come in between us?

20090203080712AA1itXj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you ever pulled a justified prank on an Ex Spouse? If so What was it?	I met mine at a Wal Mart Diner to give her a court ordered Spousal settlement check. I was bitter about the way she held MY Pension as hostage to get it. I got her back by dropping several expensive make up items in her huge purse. When she got up to leave, I was grinning and she said, why are you grinning, I just cleaned your savings out? I just shrugged my shoulders and looked away. She passed through the exit doors as I sat in the restaurant finishing my pepsi and watching her through the windows. The alarm went off and she froze. I was laughing uncontrollably by then as the Walmart Greeter and security were taking her bag away from her and calling the Police. She shot a glance at me that would have burned a hole through 4 inches of steel. There was nothing she could do or say. This was my finest moment ever. Her name was in the paper and she had to go to court and received probation. ROFLMAO! POETIC JUSTICE.

I have a younger brother and a sister, they're really short for their age. both are 11 & 12. they're not growing very fast, because they have weak bones and they're developing scoliosis and have ameeogenesis imperfecta, which is when your teeth are missing the enamel and you're teeth look really yellow. So I want some ideas on their diet on what should they eat after school? what they should take to school and snacks? how many glasses of milk and water they should drink and how much of fruits and vegies they should eat?      My mom's schedule is really out right now and she's so confused about on what she should give to them to school and home. plz make me a timetable on what they should eat at home and what they should take to school and at what time they should eat lunch and dinner. because they usually come back from school at 3:00pm and I come back at 4:30pm. So I really want to make or help my siblings to be tall and have a healthy life.       Also tell me some exercises that will help them grow tall. Because my sister has already started her periods and she's only in grade 5, I knw that's normal but I would love to help her grow at least 5'1" or 5'2" which is 4 or 5 inches taller than my mom. And the doctors are growth hormone to my brother. because he's really short. So people my sibling's lives are in your hands. Please help and May God bless and reward you for what you will be doing for them. plzzzzzzzz give me everything in detail.....Thank You God Bless..

20090203080121AAZUV8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should my boyfriend be paying rent?	My boyfriend has spent every night at my apartment for the last two months.  He gets ready for work there, comes "home" and showers there and spends every weekend there.  Granted, I enjoy having him there and I think it was the next logical step in our relationship, but he hasn't offered to pay any bills or rent.  He does not have a lease or apartment of his own to pay for.  He does not make much money, and he is also paying for college night classes.  But he is not completely strapped.  He manages to have money to go to the bar or shows or whatever else decides to do.      Shouldn't he be offering to pay half the rent and/or half the bills?  Or something?  He's aware that I'm actually having money problems myself.  Honestly I'm annoyed that he hasn't offered and that I may be the one that has to bring this up.  He's watched me pay bills and pay rent for two months now and has never said a word about it...      Ugh.  I'm frustrated...
