Instead, download 1.2 or do it all by hand.<br>  What system do you use? I assume it’s windows. Force the iTouch into DFU mode by holding both buttons for 15 seconds. *count out loud – One Mississippi, two Mississippi, etc.* then hold home button for a further 10 seconds * count out loud – One Mississippi, two Mississippi, etc.* <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|zSbJNQxxaa	Try using Voltage Jailbreaker.

WOiH4CGvaa	Don't hold your breath! Sorry but the likely-hood of your camera being found is low. Even most real camera stores, won't bother to cross check serial numbers against a "stolen" list. <br>  <br>  The police, do routinely check pawn shops for "reported" stolen goods. Plus, you will need a police report, if you want to file an insurance claim.<br>  <br>  So do indeed file a report!|`|TgT6Agjbaa	wow<br>  thats intense.|`|d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	While some devices do have devices in them which enable actual tracking of a gps signal, what she probably means is that they will register your serial number as stolen, so if someone tries to sell it to a reputable dealer, it will be flagged.<br>  <br>  Filing a police report helps you in a court of law, because if the item is recovered you have made on official claim of ownership, and the police report will help you prove that.  It also means that whoever stole the item can be prosecuted and arrested for that crime if it is uncovered in another investigation, or if the camera ends up being turned into the police station, they will know who the rightful owner is.|`|bhbY31R9aa	i doubt they could trace it, just by knowing the serial number. but if its handed in somewhere, like a police station they might have a database where they could put the serial number, Sony could then look at it and then tell the police it belonged to you, but thats a guess.|`|Cuo9LaDGaa	they probably had a GPS on a camera with the serial number on it.

PpiKJHRRaa	I see you've already asked at least 3 questions basically on the same subject.  You probably could have just combined it into one.  I've never seen a CRT television come with an HDMI input because it doesn't make sense.  So if your trying to plug in your HDMI cord and there is no HDMI port, then yes, it's not going to work.  Did you ever play that game as a kid when you had to fit the shapes in the hole?  Did you realize that the square block didn't fit in the circular hole?<br>  <br>  Your solution is to get a TV with an HDMI port or get a converter.  Search online for HDMI to Composite converter and that should do the trick for you.|`|dqzoEw67aa	You might be able to hook the ps3 to your tv with the yellow/red and white cables if it has that output, but blu ray is a 1080p output for HD tvs, and a tv without HDMI or at least component (red/green/blue) inputs, can't display any HD signal.<br>  <br>  So you could run a blu ray in the ps3 if you can hook the yellow-red-white cable up to your tv, but you'll only get sd quality.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	If the TV has HDMI sockets, I don't think there is more than one kind of HDMI.

Ns6I7MmBaa	Ni-cad or Ni-MH are supposed to be run down before charging or they may have a memory that will no longer hold a full charge.  Li-ion can be recharged frequently without letting them run down and should not really be run down all the way frequently.  However, my laptop and auto gps say to use them on battery occasionally (apparently to keep the battery capacity meter calibrated).<br>  <br>  I forgot to note if my new shaver said anything specific because I did not realize it had li-ion initially.  But it does say you can put it in its cleaner/charger daily (battery lasts for 14 three minute shaves).<br>  <br>  I have never had any problem with li-ion cell phone batteries wearing out after years, usually charged daily, but occasionally uncharged for days until low battery.

lf5ZXo9Eaa	The term "unlocked" refers to GSM phones only (cell phones with SIM cards).  Since you are with Verizon, this doesn't apply to you since Verizon is on a different system (CDMA).  Verizon will allow you to use any CDMA phone and you will have to provide them with the ISDN number on the phone and as long as it's clean (the previous user doesn't have any outstanding bills/it's not stolen/etc) then you should be good to go!|`|771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	The meaning of the term unlocked simply means that it is open to all netwroks and can accept any sim card that u choose to insert, and providing u have the nessacary seetings updated it will work fine. Genrally it is better to get an unlocked fone as this means u can switch netwroks at a later date if u chose to. With regard for the handset to be activated by verizon i dont even think ur gunna have to do that, if ur old fone i on contact just insert the contract sim into the new fone and switch it on the fone shud automatically pick up the network, from there just call verizon and ask em to send the up to date setting for mms and wap. The customer service people will tell u how to install these step by step and that shud allow the fone to function normally. Hope this helps and happy b/day to ur daughter :)|`|b418c211198eed0f2b47f24498a3f9beaa	I believe that if a phone is "Unlocked" it will work with any plan though any carrier.

HVQFVtelaa	OK, there are about three different eras of records. 78's, around 20's, 30's, and 40's. 45's, around 50's and 60's. And 33 1/3's, around 60's past. (no smart *** year pickers please, decades are approximate). 78's & 33 1/3's are dinner plate size, and 45's are saucer size. <br>  <br>  Anything that will play a 78, will usually play a 45 and 33 1/3, and will be belt driven. Later direct drives usually only play 33 1/3.<br>  <br>  If you get a chance to buy a 78 & 45 player that will let you stack them, buy it now, you won't find it around much longer, and it will be a very nice piece. A direct drive 33 1/3 you can buy for decades from now.

This is different from an ordinary family house, where one licence covers the whole building.<br>  <br>  This is an extract from the TV Licence web site:<br>  <br>  "You must be covered by a valid TV Licence if you watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV. It makes no difference what equipment you use - whether it’s a laptop, PC, mobile phone, digital box, DVD recorder or a TV set - you still need a licence. <br>  You do not need a TV Licence to view video clips on the internet, as long as what you are viewing is not being shown on TV at the same time as you are viewing it. <br>  If you use a digital box with a hi-fi system, or another device that can only be used to produce sounds and can't display TV programmes, and you don't install or use any other TV receiving equipment, you don't need a TV Licence. "<br>  <br>  This is an extract from their site covering shared houses - the last paragraph applies to you:<br>  <br>  "Do I need a licence if I live in a shared house and it's not my TV?<br>  If you've signed a joint tenancy agreement with your housemates, you'll only need one TV Licence to cover all the TV receivers in your house. So it's a good idea to share the cost.<br>  If you don't have a licence between you, whoever is found watching TV when an Enforcement Officer comes to visit is the one who risks prosecution and a fine of up to ￡1,000. It could be you, whether you own the TV or not.<br>  If you've signed a separate tenancy agreement and you're taking a TV receiver to use in your room, you'll need a TV Licence of your own."<br>  <br>  So there you are. The law is completely clear - you DO need your own licence - even if you only play games on the telly.

F67IRVmvaa	Yes, you CAN share ONE iTunes account.<br>  <br>  If you're sharing an iTunes, you can keep ALL your songs in the same iTunes, all you need to do is set up your iPod so that you can manage your music and videos MANUALLY. What this does is that it doesn't automatically sync your iPod when you connect it to a computer. This way, you don't have to limit your iPod to ONE computer, either - you can hook up to any one of your friend's computer and click/drag the songs that you do want and, since it doesn't auto-sync, the songs you don't want stay on the computer and don't get in your iPod.<br>  <br>  To do this, simply<br>  <br>  1) Open iTunes<br>  <br>  2) Connect your iPod to the computer<br>  <br>  3) When the teeny iPod shows up on the iTunes, click on it.<br>  <br>  4) Check the selection that says: "Manually Manage Music and Videos."<br>  <br>  After you do, you'll get a message telling you that you need to disconnect your iPod manually. Click "Yes" or "Okay" - all this means is that, before you disconnect the iPod from the computer, you have to hit the "Eject" button that's next to your little iPod icon.<br>  <br>  And that's it!<br>  <br>  Now, to get songs, movies, etc on your iPod all you have to do is click/drag the song onto your little iPod icon on the left-hand navigation bar.

This means you must run the source (i.e. DVD player, cable TV) audio directly to the surround sound system.|`|493de4c102ebb2bca874d89a8d13eb5caa	You will only get 5.1 surround sound if it is connected to a source that is broadcasting it . A standard aerial will not broadcast 5.1. Sky HD does broadcast in 5.1 on certain channels ie sky movies. <br>  Also the source would have to be connected to your home cinema system via an optical cable (￡10-￡15 from Currys). <br>  DVD's are normally 5.1 but once again you will need to connect this via an optical cable.|`|jBIotay5aa	Easy one.

S4C6EkG5aa	The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is the newest edition of the Curve Family. 8320 is the older version. The look of the 8900 is incredible, it has a new interface, and more capabilities that pretty much combine the 8310 and 8320 into the 8900 plus some. I would definitely go with the 8900, you won't be disappointed.|`|sYZ6IPWjaa	I agree with BlueBerry Addict. The Curve 8900 offers some excellent upgrades over the Curve 8320. If cost is a concern, then you may want to get the Curve 8320.

adGK7fSjaa	You are probably looking in the UK page of the Sony Ericsson site. Vodafone is the only carrier for this handset, but they use the British counterpart of the W705 (which is the W715) whose only difference, I think, is aGPS. If you go to the HK SE website, they still show the W705, and of course it is not shown in the US website since US networks rarely integrate top notch phones. I have the W705 and I like it, the sound in the MP3 player is crisp and powerful. The keys are wacky...=]

With a 1 GB card, you'll easily get 200+ jpeg photos at highest quality.<br>  <br>  In fact, 2 GB and 4 GB cards are fairly common and inexpensive and you can hold even more photos.<br>  <br>  You'd need either an SD card (1 GB or 2 GB) or an SDHC card (4 GB).<br>  <br>  Generally speaking for brands, Sandisk cards are very high quality, with the Sandisk Extreme series being the fastest.  The Sandisk Ultra II series is significantly slower for transfers from card to computer, but should be fast enough in a D40 for day-to-day shooting.  If you're on a budget, the Sandisk Ultra II's are good enough; if you can afford the extra money, go for the Sandisk Extreme cards and a good, fast USB 2.0 card reader.|`|MqXbtvP9aa	16 gb ultra card|`|j5Apt8hWaa	A 2 GB SD card will hold 232 images if you shoot at your cameras  highest resolution .. RAW + JPEG.<br>  <br>  If you shoot using JPEG Fine, image size Large, it will hold 548 image files.<br>  <br>  Look on page 116 of your users manual.  The capacities there are listed for a 512 SD card (hard to find now that 1 GB cards are about the smallest you can buy ... at about $2 on sale)  You will just have to do the math to match the card capacity you eventually buy.<br>  <br>  Buying a 16 GB SDHC card would be a bit ludicrous, since putting all your eggs in one basket is always risky.  Who would really want over 4300 images on one card.  Just the time it would take to copy them to your computer would be ridiculous|`|F9bLHZ1daa	Buy 2 or 4 GB.

cobNiiLraa	When you are playing that "Basic Step"... are you using YOUR Mii??<br>  <br>  Or, are you using someone else's Mii??<br>  <br>  I believe the board actually uses your weight to calibrate how sensitive the board is during actual games...  so, if you were using someone else's Mii (someone who has a different weight than you) that could affect it.<br>  <br>  Also... are you playing on "Carpet" or a hard wood surface??<br>  <br>  The balance board is not as accurate on Carpet, so... if that is the case, you might want to try putting on those little "Leg Extensions" that came in the box.<br>  <br>  Also... make sure you go through the Body Test with your Mii before you play the other games... that way, the Wii Fit will know your weight and BMI.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Step is very sensitive to being used on carpet.  try using the balance board on a hard surface.

Try following the calibration instructions carefully when you turn it on.  But just so that you know that I don't think you don't know what you are doing.

4TZsKgAUaa	You can't.<br>  <br>  Only HDMI devices can communicate over HDMI.  It isn't a matter of the cable you use, it is a matter of the language the devices are speaking.  There is NO, and there never will be, adapter to convert HDMI into anything else.  You can convert DVI to HDMI, but if you go the other way round, many devices will reduce your signal quality.  HDMI is a mandate, a security standard, and a language.  An HDMI device only likes another HDMI device.  You can thank Sony for that.<br>  <br>  HDMI isn't neccessarily the highest quality picture.  The source material will determine that.  As a rule, you are only good for 480i over anything less than component connections.  Component can handle up to 1080i on some gear.  For 1080p, you have to have HDMI.  HDMI will normally handle all the way down to 480p.  So, you see you can in fact send a low resolution signal over HDMI if you want.<br>  <br>  It is time to upgrade to an actual receiver with HDMI switching and a real set of speakers, or time to upgrade to a Bluray surround system in a box.<br>  <br>  If you want HDMI connectivity on your sat box, you are going to pay more for it.<br>  <br>  The way this would be done is you have to get that receiver, and the new sat box.  Then, you will need three HDMI cables.  Don't buy them from the store, buy them from Bluejeans cable on the net.  The guy has the best cables in the world, and they are far cheaper than what you will pay at the store.<br>  <br>  Connect your new sat box to the receiver with one HDMI cable, and connect your new surround system to the receiver with another HDMI cable.  Then connect the receiver to the television with the third HDMI cable.<br>  <br>  Done.<br>  <br>  HDMI handles audio as well, and you have to use it to get the new high resolution audio codecs, so there is no reason at all to run a separate audio cable on any of these connections.<br>  <br>  Go to bluejeans cable on the net and read up on his information.  He will educate you on this, so you don't make another mistake.  The site is very informative for the layman.  When you decide to buy your cables after upgrading, you have a choice.<br>  <br>  You can pay 150 dollars for a Chinese cable that may not even meet HDMI spec from the store, or you can pay the guy from Bluejeans 50 bucks for one made in the USA to much higher standards<br>  <br>  Make no mistake, though, you WILL have to upgrade to do this.  If anyone tells you otherwise, they are absolutely full of it.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Your TV turner needs to be an HD-Turner. You have to call your cable company and upgrade your TV Box. Then once you get your new HD Turner Box, simply run an HDMI cable from your TV to the Cable Box. Then run a fiber cable, or analog cables (red & white) from your to your Surround Sound Receiver :)

RyvKws7Laa	The only thing from the settings that I could see that might be causing it is the sleep timer.  But you should have to turn this on each time you turn on the TV.  It shouldn't just be happening the way you describe.  But you could look for that and turn it off if you can (turn it off in settings that is).<br>  <br>  Otherewise, you should talk to Sharp or the place you bought it from.  It could be a firmware upgrade that is needed.  I see no evidence of this around on forums, but I know there was a Samsung that needed such not too long ago.  So that's why I'm curious if maybe your Sharp is in need of the same.  If it is, they can walk you through actually doing the upgrade.

f3e5e4d7af5d1a05594696425078e04faa	It does now if it ever did.  There is hardly anything original on television and it just seems to be getting worse.  With this reality TV fad, they don't even have to come up with characters and plots anymore.  They just throw a buch of people who society deems undesirable or weird and film their day to day goings on.  We have these "best of" and "most shocking moments in this or that" shows, where it is just old shows, re-edited and then a few celebs here and there to tell some dry jokes.
w4I9oj2Maa	Kinda...it's nice to watch it whenever you want, but you still need an OLD STYLE VCR to make a Permanent record of the show.  That's because the Hard Drive has limited space, you can't add a 2nd hard drive for expansion purposes, and you can't burn a DVD directly from it, as you STILL have to have a recorder attached.<br>  <br>  And no HD recordings...So Tivo works to an extent, but not like 70% of the viewing public would like it to work....

wF6eje9Maa	There are two options here.<br>  One is legal, and one is only legal if you own the game and have imaged the disc yourself (Legal until distributed)<br>  Option 1, most games now are filled with a DoS file that can detect whether DaemonTools is running, and will not work unless you turn this application off (Hence not being able to use the disc).<br>  You will have to download a different tool, for example MagicISO or Alcohol120% to do this as the application can be closed and the virtual driver still functional.<br>  <br>  The other option is simply to use (OR BUY) the disc and run it from that.

wkLTTr06aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  I had the same problem. My kodak camera would take movies but only in " ___.mov" format. As you know the .MOV format only opens in Quicktime which won't work to burn to CD or DVD and play on your DVD player.<br>  <br>  <br>  Quicktime has an option for an upgrade (link below) that lets you edit your movies and save them as a file which can be burned to DVD and played on your pllayer. This may be your best option since it only costs about $ 30- and is designed to do exactly what you want to do.<br>  <br>  I did a search for "MOV to AVI converter" and found this link below for a  converter to change your mov file to an avi file (free download ).<br>  <br>  I did not try this because I bought a Canon camera that takes better movies and saves them in "AVI" format.<br>  <br>  There were many free downloads for converters and I am sure they would work for you. However if you download any of them save the download to your desktop and scan it with your antivirus and antispyware apps before you install. That's good advice for any download from the internet and one I practice everytime.<br>  <br>  I would advise the $ 30- upgrade of Quicktime because I believe you will find it easier to use one program instead of two. Also the upgrade should allow editing of your movie.<br>  <br>  It always is disapointing when the programs included with purchases are "lite editions" and to do anything you need to upgrade.In this case the upgrade is probably best.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  <br>  Al|`|7yI05q0Daa	a DVD Creator.<br>  <a href="http://www.iskysoft.com/dvd-creator-mac.html?page=126" rel="nofollow">http://www.iskysoft.com/dvd-creator-mac....</a><br>  <br>  Just follow the guide on that page.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	you need a dvd burner on the computer|`|5GGDtxHfaa	Aimersoft DVD Creator is a good choice.

c1sRWiX3aa	A couple of things:<br>  <br>  1) No matter how good they make the 360 (or PS3, Wii or anything else) it will never be totally free of the RROD. The RROD is a general hardware failure, and as is the nature of electronics there is always going to be SOME percentage of failure rate in them. <br>  <br>  Having said that, the first answerer is correct. The Jasper chip is smaller than the Falcon (65nm compared to 90nm) and in theory should be less prone to the RROD. <br>  <br>  The 'Valhalla' chip, set to hit the shelves in the fall, is supposed to be 45nm, further reducing the chances of the RROD...at least in theory.<br>  <br>  2) In my opinion the only way to 'guarantee' yourself a Jasper chipped 360 right now is to do some research. It's still fairly early in the Jasper chips life and there will still be 'old stock' (ie Falcon chips) on the shelves. But if you do some research you can find a Jasper fairly easily. <br>  <br>  Hopefully by mid-year the Falcon chips will be pretty much off the shelves and people will have a much better chance of getting a Jasper without having to look at the system before buying it.|`|AA10958746	When you buy a new Xbox you need to check for it's manufacture/production date.

Ms3dn0q3aa	If you know the scale shape for c.  C should be the first note of each scale all you have to do is find the starting note for the other scales. EG if you can play c pentatonic you start on a c on the 6th string. if you change that to an E on the 6th string (fret 12) you can play the same scale from there and it will be E pentatonic. Same goes for all scales with root note on 6th string. If it starts on 5th string etc find the starting note on that string. Just for your reference.<br>  6th string notes<br>  Open = E<br>  fret 1 = F<br>  fret 2 = F#<br>  fret 3 = G<br>  fret 4 = G#<br>  fret 5 = A<br>  fret 6 = A#<br>  fret 7 = B<br>  fret 8 = C<br>  fret 9 = C#<br>  fret 10 = D<br>  fret 11 = D#<br>  fret 12 = E ( you will probably find it easier to play E scales here than on an open)<br>  and the pattern continues...<br>  Hope this helps.

Make sure you have enough watts on your current powersupply to run the card and that you have one external six-pin power connector available. Your processor and RAM are fine. Ignore the person above me.|`|nHhwBETsaa	Everything is fine except for that graphics card which is awful I'm afraid to say. <br>  <br>  The way you know how good a modern graphics card is is by looking at each number. The first (in this case a 7) represents the line of cards it's in. nVidia and ATi both release a new batch every year or so.<br>  <br>  The second number refers to how good it is, the higher the better. Generally the highest is 8, I've never seen a 1 before. 6 is usually pretty decent 5 is a bit meh, 4 is going into no-no territory, 2 is bad news.<br>  <br>  You should be able to get a newer one at a relatively cheap price, I'd advise looking for a GeForce 8600GT at the very least, they're not too old but they're pretty good. <br>  <br>  For now, try turning down graphical settings and resolution.|`|n3f4EF7Kaa	Can You RUN It?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a>|`|I91lFgTdaa	Well Since you meet all requirements the PC is maybe just not made fro Assassin's Creed.

VJ1C5JsYaa	first off xeineia is thinking of a router and not a modem. All modems work the same for the Xbox. The problem you might be facing is your plan with ATT. Just because you have a highspeed connection does not mean you have a good connection for XBL. Go to www.speedtest.net and see what your connection actually is mine is considered great and I still get lag every now and then.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Christopher B while I thank you for telling me something I already know I was simply trying to answer his question in the simplest form possible. The site that I gave him tells him both his upload, download AND his ping. So your post is also just another way of showing him the exact same thing I did. Also while yes the site I linked to is built for speed in some ways so is xbox live. You NEVER connect right to someone that is uploading and ect because the person you connect to is the one that has the best connection not someone that is using all their bandwidth. Also After a certain point of having such a bad conenction they would lag out. The person that posed the question simply stated that he ALWAYS has a slow connection because of that it could be considered that he is the person with the slow connection. Also he stated that he connected the Xbox directly to the modem thus ruling out that he is using up bandwidth with downloading things. This would mean that it is HIS overall connection that is slow. For this reason I told him to go to the link I provided and see what type of connection he has. If it is decided that his overall connection is poor then he will have to take it up with his ISP.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	To the 1st poster, Linksys does not make modems buddy ;)<br>  <br>  To the 2nd poster, that is because you are not going to a website that is BUILT to be fast, you are going to some other dude who may have uploads going or have a crappy connection :)<br>  <br>  A connection is a two way street, both sides have to be good. Having just a northbond lane does not do so well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Real answer is this, what is "highspeed"? That number that they give you, that is the CAP they put on it, many other things will make it slower sometimes.<br>  <br>  To play games online you need a good PING<br>  do this<br>  Start > run (or type in the box with vista) > cmd > enter > ping google.com<br>  You should see a ##ms. What is that MS? Should be LOW. For me, it is 32ms, a GREAT ping.<br>  I call this your base ping, your ping to a fixed website that is meant to be FAST and good.<br>  <br>  When playing games online it goes from you, to the other players, so something around 75ms is the best you will really get, sadly. Your connection goes from where you live, to the guy in HI or Alaska, your ping to each other will most likely be around 250ms which is a 1/4 of a sec.<br>  <br>  <br>  What can you do from this point? Not much, also switching ISPs wouldn't help much either as you will be using the same cables which slow your ping down.<br>  You could only MOVE to a location with a better ping. The closer you are to your ISP, the better...|`|d5c8a4978056e5924b26ff6790b3553faa	just because you have high speed internet and a direct connection to the modem doesn't mean you necessarily have a good connection. you could  have a modem that xbox doesn't have listed as one of "their modems". go on xbox.com and look up the list of modems they support. go out and by one of those, a good modem is a linksys.|`|yIMUfAj4aa	it might just be the traffics for that one specific hour, if its slow every day, then you might have to get a new modem, router, or call you internet provider.

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	Nearly all, if not all, digital cameras with a live LCD display show a frame counter (approximate -- it's never really definite and it varies depending on the format and compression used) on the information overlay that indicates the amount of remaining pictures left that you can store to the memory card or internal memory, just like the Sony Mavica MVC-FD200.<br>  <br>  <br>  Follow-up:<br>  Right, I made no mention of playback. Unless otherwise shown, most cameras have a frame counter as I have described above (counts down how many pictures you can still take). I would assume that the feature you've described is also a frame counter, but of a different form that is no longer popular (counts up to the maximum).<br>  <br>  If you're interested in finding out what frame you're on with a camera that counts down, simply enter playback mode and explore the pictures you've taken -- some cameras display the picture number of a picture so it's as simple as finding the most recent picture and adding 1 to that number to figure out what picture you're currently on.|`|6a12759b9392420cda7b8443e7858dc1aa	Count how many times you press the shutter, then subtract that from how many you have left then divide by the size of the memory card.

zmyZ9BgZaa	www.llama.com has some good info there, modding controllers and consoles. Then maybe check www.thexboxexpert.com, i know he has some for sale, but i didn't se if there were any tutorials on it.
6beL9zycaa	Go online, I see them all the time for 99 cents.  Try You Tube, going to the site of your favorite group or singer.  That's usually where I see them.  I've never seen them for free.  Ever.  Good luck.

Zud9PgKEaa	You have to bring up itunes before you plug you it into your computer.
3m9DQuDRaa	Well, due to your small amount of music, and the fact that you want to watch movies, I'd say get yourself an iPod touch.  Yeah, you may not like the touch screen all that much as you go along (touch screen may be hip, but it's so iffy!), but the screen is a LOT bigger, so your movies will be seen in crisper color and easier to watch.  <br>  <br>  The drive size on the Touch is significantly smaller than Classic, though.  Touch goes to about 32G, while Classic has the 120G size, and depending on how many movies or TV shows you want, you might want the extra size.<br>  <br>  My collection of tech gizmos is for specific things.  I currently have a 120G iPod Classic, with 40G filled with ONLY music...  and an 8G memory card in my Blackberry Storm solely for the use of movies.  8G holds about one to two seasons of any TV show, or about 12 movies... But I doubt you want to spend the type of money, especially if you're accident prone.<br>  <br>  400 songs shouldn't take more than 5G of space, and you'd still have 10G if you got the 16G iPod Touch, you should be set for what you need it for.  So there's my vote...  16G iPod Touch.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Have fun.|`|PpheQM2naa	Hmm, i have an ipod touch, and i like it alot, i have had it for a little over a year now, and i still like it, i have 450+ songs on it and a whole bunch of apps so it has a good bit of spae, i would get the apple care to (its like 50 dollars), applecare is if you break your ipod you can send it back to them and they will fix it free of charge (it lasts for 1 or 2 years im not sure, and its renewable) plus i like my ipod because it is alot easier to browse songs on it than an ipod classic.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped =]
qWicVoU9aa	Nope, gone is gone.
uIg6an6Jaa	the skateboard one <br>  <br>  its kind of hard but it will keep you amused all day
7aqimHVfaa	No, it doesn't. You can download music from many online services including Amazon. All services vary in price, so shop around if you really want to get the best value for money.<br>  <br>  Also try and get the highest bitrate you can. The majority of tracks on itunes are 128kbps AAC (with the exception of iTunes plus tracks 256kbps AAC). The highest bitrate you can get without going lossless (the most common being FLAC or Apple Lossless) is 320kbps MP3/AAC.<br>  <br>  You can even rip music into your itunes library straight from the CD. Then as soon as you plug your iphone/ipod touch/ipod in, it'll sync straight away.|`|zrj8jhssaa	Nope, I have an 8gig new ipod touch and I get my music from where ever I want. BUT, if you have linux you won't be able to get it because it NEEDS to have itunes, no other typer of music player|`|f167e988cf95e16dc2862de8ec651915aa	nope, you can add cd's etc|`|b55f0e519614a0b70ec04c08eb33d605aa	No.<br>  <br>  You have to use iTunes (the application) to put music on an iPod.  Music comes in different file formats.  AAC is the format that music files use when purchased from the iTunes store.  AAC format, to the best of my knowledge, is only supported by iTunes/iPods.<br>  <br>  iTunes works with other file formats as well, basically it works with any format support by quicktime.  The one format that I'm aware of that isn't supported by iTunes is protected mode WMA - which won't play in iTunes (application).  If your music will play in iTunes, it will also work on your iPod.<br>  <br>  Protected mode WMA files are usually the songs purchased through Napster, Rhapsody etc.. in particular the ones were "lease" all the music you want for a flat fee - you get to listen to it all you want for as long as you continue to pay rent.|`|y0L6PuZXaa	No, you simply have to put the music that you already have onto itunes, where you can then sync the music to your Ipod.<br>  <br>  : ) Hope this helps!|`|cA3PAgetaa	no, you can download the music from anywhere, and import any music on your computer into itunes for free,no worries ;)
fdFGiCeNaa	Dont really know what  you mean but..<br>  <br>  either connect it 2 ur PC via iTunes <br>  <br>  OR hold down the circle button at the front screen and the small black 'off' button at the top of the ipod touch together, for it to turn off, then turn it back on again|`|jKLLoMDdaa	Well be more specific.<br>  <br>  You mean disable like when you enter the wrong password a couple of times?<br>  <br>  If that's so just plug it into your computer and open iTunes. <br>  <br>  If that's not what you mean please explain

They are overrated and lack quality. I have seen countless people get ipods break them repeatedly only to go back and get the same thing again. Sony honestly has some of the best reviews and it plays videos and wmas so your covered for everything else. Yes Ipods are appealing but i have a touch and its annoyingly hard to carry around if you move around a lot, it just sits on my desk.<br>  <br>  I have the sony NWZ-S615|`|fcQQDonWaa	hands down best mp3 player is the ipod touch. supports all formats. and u can get a attachment to the original jack to connnect to your stereo. i say this because some mp3 players will play it very soft on your stereo, whilst the ipod is very powerful.|`|VejNaTNaaa	ipod touch definitely

qWicVoU9aa	The device support centers do not repair devices.  If it is under warranty they can replace it for you and it will be replaced with a refurb|`|fCF02V87aa	They will give you a re-furb. Ive tried taking phones apart and it is quite complex and really not worth the effort. That is physical damage--so unless you have the insurance they are going to charge you good. Make sure you store everything to your sim card. If you need to buy a new one you can get a much better deal off the net. I use Monster Cellular from Florida.

Second you need a mouse for the PC since you will use an in game cursor to click on things to play the game. Next you will need a keyboard, because, well a PC without a keyboard is just dumb in my humble opinion. Sims isn't that graphically demanding so you don't need a super expensive system to play. Above are recommended specs to play Sims.
