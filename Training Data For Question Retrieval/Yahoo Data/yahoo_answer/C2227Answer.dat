tjLNWUtJaa	It was Stalker, I believe 88 or 89.   That would have been Stalker v2 or v3|`|UVUYG5jaaa	i think it was bigger than 3&3/4. it was from the 70s and EVERYONE had one. it had kayaks, it had jeeps, it had tanks, it had helicoptors, it was more popular than barbie......then WHAM!!!...the popularity was gone...and so was g.i.joe
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Depends, did you have unprotected vaginal, or anal sex?  Whichever hole the babby batter went in, that's the hole that you test.|`|154dzJ1Faa	When in doubt, always read the directions!! LOL -- I know -- radical concept!|`|AA12177717	Pregnancy hormones show up in your urine, so pee on it, but read the directions.  If you aren't old enough to read the directions first, you may want to rethink being sexually active.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	Chuck it in the bowl after a #2 (can't go #2 without #1 --- IMPOSSIBLE) cover all bets|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I threw up on mine and I guess I had the sprem or hormoans in my puke.  It told me I was pregnent.|`|JK2RvliYaa	put in in your glass of sunny D|`|VkC3NfMIaa	You pee. <br>  If you dont know that, you shouldnt be needing one. <br>  Anyways, have you never seen the commercials for FirstResponse where they're saying something about how its the best pregnancy test you will ever pee on?<br>  if you dont know how to spell pregnancy, you shouldnt be needing one either.<br>  any why not just read the directions?|`|1os95dHZaa	Those tests cost like a dollar each you cant afford not to take the right! No solid poops only diarrhea and urine are acceptable. You should ask these question before you go filling our landfills with wasted pregmancy tests!|`|wkqsf5pLaa	ALL THESE ANSWERS ARE MEAN... kinda funny too.<br>  <br>  <br>  You pee on it like a waterfall... if the result is a PLUS or a pretty color, then the baby is on its way.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Just poop on it and get your mother or a close friend to help you determine the results.|`|oENe16luaa	Huh?  I always thought you were supposed to put it under your tongue like a thermometer.|`|AA10285288	Either one is fine. Pregnewt horkmones will show up in either as long as you have eaten eggs in the last 3 days.|`|wkyNWtfAaa	you're meant to masturbike your vigeina on it|`|Al4U0Im7aa	pee|`|pfd5N3j4aa	I just wanted to say that i love everyones answers haha you people are great!!! seriously.

1jIaLYYqaa	Maybe check out a site called shabbyprincess.com I know there are different designers who post digital kits that people can download on there.. I don't know how they get paid and whatnot though.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think both would be great. I personally prefer non-digital, but to each his own. If your stuff is good, try out both ways. I think it would be great.
48SlX2Yiaa	Riku turned to darkness and used that power (he was not consumed by darkness). Since he was able to control it (so he thought) he did not lose his heart. <br>  <br>  Namine is not an Organization XIII member. The members get an X in the name when its scrambled by Xemnas. She was found in Castle Oblivion by them, but she's not a member. She doesn't wear the cloak and is held against her will.<br>  <br>  Oh and Axel does not resemble Riku at all. Besides, Axel died...so if he was Riku's nobody, then Riku would no longer be whole.|`|HqoU1JJwaa	sssooo sora is roxaes nobody namina is kiari's nobody and riku well i dont know that one i believe he doesnt have a nobody he just has changed plus riku is not a heartlees nor a nobody|`|9pbj848Aaa	Ever since Riku gave in to the dark, Ansem took over his body. So what happen is that Riku lost his body and became Ansem and the only way for Riku to get his body back is by beating Ansem inside of him. But you have to know that Riku don't have a nobody, he never became a heartless. He gave into the dark so there is no way that he should have had a nobody. But this is my opinion about that but i hope somebody makes sense of this as well.
xzt6JE34aa	I was looking for that and I couldn't find it in xbox.com. I usually saw it all over the 360 dashboard in those xbox live ads, but I haven't seen it for a while. I'll keep looking and if I find anything I'll let you know. <br>  peace|`|5451521e221f76559c20e1e48dc8f890aa	if it's not on the official site, then there is none|`|F5hHK38xaa	i think that deal is over but if you want you can always call Microsoft and ask for more information

AA11678263	On the PC version, when you get to the top of your career track you will be brought home and collected by helicopter (not a plane though...) always, regardless of career track.  It is the upgrade from the limo.  You can buy the helicopter for yourself in apartment life, but need a helipad in order to use it as a substitute for a car.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	In the military career you arrive in a helicopter after you get past a certain point, I'm not really sure about what happens in any other career...|`|5bqKLMg0aa	In sims apartments, you can buy a plane and take it where ever you please. In the other games, (I don't know how many jobs) I know that the Business job once you get to the top level or two or three levels to the top that your sims carpool arrives by plane.|`|hzabyd1paa	1, it depends on what game console you are playing on<br>  <br>  #2, usually those videos are just to get u interested to wanna keep playing<br>  <br>  #3 if there is a way(i doubt it)  it probly would not be through normal game play you would have to cheat, hack, mod etc
AA12317810	"Naminé was born when Sora stabbed himself with Ansem's artificial Keyblade in order to restore Kairi near the end of Kingdom Hearts. This made Naminé a very odd Nobody, born from Kairi's heart and Sora's body and soul. Kairi's own body never became a Nobody because her heart lacked darkness (since she was one of the Princesses of Heart), so her body and soul were never able to leave the Realm of Light and thus made it seem like Kairi was in a comatose state until she regained her heart. However, this means that Naminé was also born without Kairi's memories, only furthering her status as an unusual entity, and she and Kairi are incomplete without each other. And because of the fact that Naminé is formed from Sora's body, she has the power to manipulate his memories as well as the memories of those who are connected to him, prompting several others, even herself, to call her a "witch". She came into being at Castle Oblivion, found by the Organization XIII."
eNHGiEvGaa	I don't trust those who say that gambling within your own home is legal.  Even less do I trust those who say it's permissible within the building.  However, I would be shocked if anyone was actually arrested for gambling.  The most likely negative consequence would be that the police would break up the game, and use it as an excuse to harass you, search for drugs and weapons, then tell you to go home if you're not up to any other trouble.  Neighbors are also likely to complain because gambling is often associated with criminal activity, even if you're really doing nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm glad to know the game of Cee-Lo is still alive and well!|`|IwqTI7Rfaa	If you are playing for money it is.  Anything that may be considered fun, or like able, you can probably bet there is a law against it somewhere.|`|rXAUJtt1aa	If you are playing with friends in your own home even if you are gambling it is not illegal.  What is illegal in these types of situations is if you were hosting the game "for profit" for the general public without regulations by the state.  Gambling is not illegal in the privacy of your own home with friends!!|`|Bh1eq1pNaa	if you were playing in your building [in your apartment] its ok, if your playing outside [of your apartment like in the hallways or lobby] then some one might come up and say something to you|`|dvevk1qbaa	what the hell is cee-lo<br>  <br>  dice games are illegal though...but i dont know what that is<br>  <br>  you mean like shooting dice right?

DpAkYZaqaa	360 - Great graphics, fun game play and very good online. To play Xbox Live Multiplayer though you need to get a gold membership<br>  <br>  Or If you want the Touch - Its mostly for single player things and some online.<br>  But with the touch if you dont have internet at the place your at, its just a iPod with Games.|`|s4WrYVu8aa	Definitely get a 360. Although the Touch may be appealing initially, if you have a lot of music, it won't be enough. Also, the apps are good but most of the quality ones aren't free. I prefer the 360(with Xbox Live especially) because of how much fun it is and the variety of games it has to offer. I would say the 30 tops the PS3 for sure. Hope this helps :-D|`|sJIGwThCaa	If you're at home a lot, get the Xbox. If you don't think you'll have much time to play it, get the iPod, since you can use it anywhere.|`|yVDaoZTpaa	iTouch<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine please and thank you!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApJUEUd0M8qQzaRW.OfahSHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304130614AADoZiA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vrBVvAQmaa	360
f4d1b694bbe5d754965c49f945a6756daa	The ladies have given you a good answer. Let me just fill in a few details.<br>  <br>  First of all, welcome aboard! I've been a ham since 1968 and I think its a great hobby. <br>  <br>  To operate a Ham radio, you will need a license. The licenses now, though they are still renewing the older ones are: Technician, General and Extra Class. The amount of space on the bands you are allowed to transmit on gradually increases as you move up the license ladder from Technician to Extra. <br>  <br>  The ARRL has a great place to start for beginners. There are various educational options, from online classes to buying the books yourself and studying the way hams have been doing since they instituted the licensing system back in the 1920s.  The first link I am attaching is to the main ARRL website. You'll notice in the big blue banner a mention of classes, exams, clubs, hamfests, and addresses. Click on those links and you can get started. <br>  <br>  The code requirement for licensing was dropped as of February 23, 2007. Hmm, just a little over 2 years and a week. <br>  <br>  I'd also suggest, as one of the ladies did, clicking on the Learn About Amateur Radio and WeDoThat-Radio.org links. There are some really interesting things about our hobby that the web wizards there have done an outstanding job of presenting. <br>  <br>  Let's talk about spectrum for a moment. Remember that you are allowed more band space as you move up the ladder. As a Technician, you will have a small space to use morse code, on the old Novice bands, on 80, 40, 15, and 10 meters. You will also be allowed to use voice on 10 meters, and the bands above 50 MHz. Much of the activity on the higher bands is FM. Many hams use repeaters, a receiver and transmitter combination that allows a low power radio to communicate with a range much farther than it could on its own. Sound familiar? You probably use one of the grandchildren of the VHF repeater every day, by using your cell phone. It takes a small signal, and is retransmitted over a wider area by a more powerful transmitter, which is also linked to the landlines. <br>  My second link is to the Frequency allocations allowed to all Hams in the US, the starter frequencies are under Novice and Technician. <br>  <br>  My next piece of advice is to find a ham radio club in your area and contact them to find out when there is a meeting. There, you will meet other hams, and quite possibly, meet your "Elmer", a kind of a "cutesy" name for someone with more experience who can help you along the way toward getting your license.  Remember on the big blue banner where it said clubs, well, click there and type in your zip code and select a distance, and find your club. There is a description on the club entries about what they do, but most of the ones I have seen all say "newcomers welcome". <br>  <br>  And I would also recommend joining a Yahoo group. I'm a member of several, including the Ham Radio Help Group, a great group of guys and gals who are all there for one reason, to help newcomers find their way into our hobby.  Give it a click and see what it's about. <br>  <br>  Anyway, if I were on the air now, I'd be way past due for a station ID, so I'll just say 73 (morse code shorthand for best wishes) and good luck<br>  <br>  AB9BD<br>  ARRL member<br>  Quarter Century Wireless Association Member<br>  SARA member|`|9hpuBMuIaa	There are several ways to get started. 1. find a person who is a licensed ham operator and have them help you learn morse code and the information you will need to pass the various tests necessary to get your license as either,general, novice, tech or other levels. 2. find someplace that is giving classes in ham radio.  They will teach you all that you need to know so you can go for your tests. 3. Buy a radio that will receive ham radio on the various frequencies they broadcast over.<br>    You can go to a shop that sells electronic equipment( not just a place that sells tvs and stereos, but real electronic parts or equipment) and they will usually know where you will be able to find the resources you need to learn.  Use your search engine to find Ham radio clubs in your area or to just find sources to get the manuals you need and you can try to do it on your own. Also google for how to become a ham radio operator.|`|fvre0o9laa	Yes, you need a license to operate a ham radio.  No, you no longer need to know Morse code to get a license ( . <a href="http://www.arrl.org/fcc/morse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arrl.org/fcc/morse/</a> ) The licenses are free, but there are tests to pass -- at the early levels, they're mostly dos and don'ts.  Test fees are $15.<br>  <br>  If you're in the US, local ARRL members are probably your easiest entry into the ham world:<br>  <a href="http://www.wedothat-radio.org/hello/becomeaham.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wedothat-radio.org/hello/beco...</a><br>  or drop an email to newham@arrl.org<br>  <br>  More: <a href="http://www.mendonet.com/hamtest/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendonet.com/hamtest/index.ht...</a> (note texts available here)

EmTSiQPBaa	Try Lincoln pennies. They have been in production since 1909 and are probably the most popularly collected coin. You can find most of them still in circulation, even alot of the old wheat back Lincolns are still out there so you can get them for free in your change. You can look at the other pennies like the Indian Head and Large Cents too but you'll have to buy those as they won't be found in circulation anymore. Like the Buffalo's and Morgans which you will also have to buy all of them to complete the set.

Simply search excercises that stimulate the brain and prepare it for harder tasks later in time, or excercises that increases the functionality of sections of the brain.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	It was found that Brain Age's "games" will have the same amount of impact on your brain as many other common activities like reading or doing a crossword.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	In my opinion, the only thing it teaches you to do is become better at the game you're playing. Some of the smartest people I know have difficulty achieving high brain ages and other people who are complete morons have a brain age of 21. It doesn't appear to make you more intelligent or alert, mainly because the puzzles aren't challenging enough to make the brain really stretch.|`|CtKF2XRVaa	Yes, it does actually train your brain. They even did research and stuff to prove it, but i found this info in a magazine... Nintendo Power.... A while ago.... yeah i don't know. But it really does stimulate blood flow in the brain and stuff, and it even tests you after you do a kind of brain age test on it. The lower your score, the younger your brain age is. The best score is 20 years.|`|RvB0Xd7Haa	well i used it for a while and started to get a better memory but only slightly i would say though that it is gd and better than most ds games|`|JgjzcjEsaa	no|`|uX42f500aa	Well I had "More Brain Training" bought for me for Xmas along with my DS Lite, and I must say I have improved dramatically. I have gone from 50-40 to low 20's, my record is 21!<br>  <br>  Whether it actually trains your brain or not, I am not sure. The counting and mathematical game's I believe make the most difference to your actual mental ability.<br>  <br>  I would definitely advise you to carry on training, as I find it great fun, and I truly believe that it does help!

Or doves|`|soYU9Tk6aa	paper snow flakes, paper flowers, paper dolls<br>  :]|`|H0LPCjIRaa	Flowers<br>  Ballerinas<br>  I remember this one I did that involved coffee filters in kindergarten around St. Patrick's day. It was a leprechaun trap. It involved coffee filters, little green baskets that they sell strawberries in, and a couple of other random things. We left them out in the classroom overnight. We didn't catch a leprechaun, but I remember this one girl who wrote a letter to a leprechaun and it gave her a present. :)
QHPoAvlvaa	First off if you dont want to pay for that stuff again i suggest getting hold of a memory stick(<a href="http://www.gr8stationery.co.uk/images/1gb.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://www.gr8stationery.co.uk/images/1g...</a> <br>  <br>  Then transfering all the bought things onto that ( its not hard to figure out ) thats all you need to transfer the bought games and i would buy a hard drive off of this website if i were you just because there trustworhty, take your choice i dont know how big you wanted your HDD to be so there is lots there from 160gb to 500GB!! for like 60 quid i hope i ave assisted you :<br>  this is the website:<br>   <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ps3+hdd&tag=googhydr-21&index=aps&hvadid=3397300085&ref=pd_sl_93w454iuwv_b" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywo...</a> <br>  <br>  XD|`|JIfDSjKwaa	for this kind of problem u can look in market ...<br>     But any any type of data loss u can contact to : <a href="http://www.hdrconline.com/hard-disk-data-recovery-services.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdrconline.com/hard-disk-data...</a>

NNX8Qu5Taa	i dont know if you can sew but if you can it might be easier if you made a simple tube dress and wrapped the duct tape on that. for straps you could just stick two peices of tape together so that the sticky part isnt showing. <br>  <br>  It would be pretty easy to make a headband, that might be cool! <br>  <br>  Good luck , and btw: where are you going to wear this dress?|`|oojO4WAraa	Use a light weight slip and put the tape over that.  Duct tape will rip the skin off your body if you put it right on your skin.  Lay the slip down, tear off strips of tape, tape them to the skirt portion first,then the top, fold the tape over on itself to make the straps.  <br>  <br>  Duct tape comes in colors.
Dn3dm4U6aa	I tried keeping my CRT for a long time so I could still play the old systems, especially the light gun games which don't work on the new screens, but I found I just didn't play those old games enough, I'm always on the PS3 and Wii now.  Finally got rid of the big CRT.<br>  <br>  I still have a CRT in the guest bedroom, but I haven't used it in years.|`|gu3x37Muaa	It depends of you. <br>  <br>  I personally like HDTV monitors best because you can see more detail in the game.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No.  I only have HD TV.
pbqo4nXGaa	I have been sewing for over 40 yrs. I have some expensive machines but a few years ago my youngest daughter wanted a machine to learn to sew on. I got her one from Walmart, not sure it's the same model but it was a Brother, which by the way is the brand I learned on many years ago, & it was in the price range of #6 at Walmart. She has taught herself & made many halloween costumes for her boys as well as purses & other items for herself. It is a good brand of machine & I think it would suit you well for what you want to do with it & has features that would help you as you advance.  Good luck & happy sewing.|`|4wUo9UFJaa	Take your money and go to a sewing dealership.  You could get a used machine for that price.  You might think it would be cheeper at Walmart.  I bought a machine about a year ago.  Dealers give lessons on how to use the machine you purchase.  They can find you something in your budget you would be happy with.  When I was taking a class(FREE with purchase)  I was asking about what I should do to keep my machine in the best shape.  My new machine does not "need" to be oiled by me every time I use it, but the dealer does when they service it.  Service costs about $100.  Service includes cleaning, oiling and timing adjustment.  My dealer said that the 100.00 machines you can buy at Target/Walmart are metal parts attched to plastic housing inside and just a slight bump or setting it down on the table, or putting your hand on the machine as one stands up and it can knock the timing off.  He will tell you it is not worth servicing because after you pay him$100 the timing could be off again before you even get home!   You would be better finding a used machine from a dealer.  You also could shop a estate sales.  The best are the kind where a company has been hired to come in and sell the rest of the items in a house.  Things the family didnot want after someone passed away.  I have spent as low as $25.00 for a 30-50 year old machine that could be serviced and service you much better than a new $100.  machine ever would.  Also yard sales.  Any thing older than 20 yrs would work much better than the new ones--yes--even brand name ones.|`|EXpaRBsyaa	Please, if there is ANY way you can avoid it, do not buy your machine from the above named stores.  You will get no lessons, no support with machine issues,  and no service.  Buy from a dealer or trusted friend.  You will be much better off with a used machine at the price you are able to afford.  Believe me, I know.|`|q5fqP31taa	I wouldn't buy any of them.<br>  <br>  Take your $150 and visit as many sewing machine dealers has you can.<br>  <br>  Tell them what you want to sew and that you have a budgeted amount to spend.<br>  <br>  They will help you find a machine that fits your need and budget.<br>  <br>  If you have a problem or question they can help - you won't get that from anyone else but a sewing machine dealer.<br>  <br>  They will demo the machines and let you try them.<br>  <br>  Buy the machine you like best from the dealer you like best.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they have trade-ins that are ten times better than a new one in your price range.|`|oojO4WAraa	I'd go with #5 or #6 from Walmart - because those are good models, medium priced, have a lot of options and will probably do all that you need and hold up well.|`|7253cf1d67573fa9238e4dd47362b972aa	Number 5 from Walmart, the Sewing machine is the Brother XL-3125 14 stitch machine. It is a basic sewing machine, there are certain  width and length to each stitch. A button to hold down to make it reverse to lock stitches. A upper tension knob to fix tension. 4-step buttonholer. Comes with 3 additional feet as it has 1 foot aready attached, a twin needle, some regular sewing needles, a couple of screwdrivers, lint brush, and foot pedal. You will need to buy sewing machine oil because they don't include a sample of it. <br>  <br>  I can't tell you if the machine would be for you. You have to bring scraps of material and test the machines for yourself to see if it is one for you. Go to shops that sell or repair sewing machines. Test drive you friend's machine also. Test the different types machine yourself, don't let them just show it to you. You are looking for ease in use and for the way the stitch looks on different types of material you will be using. The material they use is generally starched and single layer, not 2 or more layer like you will be sewing. <br>  <br>  Don't forget you can sometimes get a machine from a garage sale or thift store. If it runs and has all of it's parts, it might be a good machine with a little age on it that you could get very cheap. Tell people that you want to sew and are looking for a machine, someone might give you one that is not being used for free.

cO10thlnaa	Uh... HMs are permanent items, unlike TMs. As long as you have the HM in your posession you can teach it as many times as you want to any pokemon that is able to learn it.|`|CtKF2XRVaa	HM moves are re-teachable to any pokemon that is able to learn them.<br>  I don't think there is even an option to delete them at all, for that matter. No worries!|`|XX0ac9iRaa	HMs can be used as many times as you want, they'll never disappear. Also, they can't be deleted from Pokemon unless you visit Move Deleter in Canalave City.|`|vUGKu877aa	if you go to the trainer dude he will delete it from lower lvl and you won't lose the hm|`|CsmCSLycaa	Yes, you can reuse HMs as many times as you like. But if you're going to release the lower leveled Quagsire anyways, I suggest not wasting time to delete the move...|`|xikfNEtcaa	...HM's are permanent. As long as they are in your inventory, you can't lose them. Ever.|`|FH2rD2aUaa	yea hms are forever kept in your tm pocket also yr going to get rid of the lower lvl q anyways y worrie|`|Ny8RKDYhaa	HMs: You can't sell them. You can use them as many times as you want on any pokemon, unlike a TM. <br>  <br>  My Kyogre had all my water HMs but then I wanted my Tentacruel to have them.<br>  <br>  Once you delete an HM move, the HM is still in your bag.
Zj4Bi2W1aa	You could put on a play... you know, Narcissus, the Battle of Troy, Arachne, Antigone, Pandora's box... Persephone and Demeter... <br>  <br>  You could get into groups of 2 or 3 (depending on the size of your class) and have them make up their own Greek Mythology story...<br>  <br>  You could each dress up as a Greek Mythology character and that class time just go around acting like them...<br>  <br>  hope it helps :D
w2pOOnaXaa	Pets is a poor expansion pack - there are few interesting objects and the pets are only a novelty for a while before they get very annoying and strays tend to dig up your gardens.<br>  <br>  Depending on your play style, if you tend to send your sims to community lots frequently (or don't mind them being away from home/the loading times) then Bon Voyage is good.<br>  <br>  Freetime is better if your play style is more keeping your families at home. There are a lot of new objects related to the hobbies (pottery wheel, basketball hoop) which are good, five new career paths, secondary aspirations as well as townie aging.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	I have them all, and my least used expansion is bon voyage, usually my people die before they get to go on vacation. I would say Pets is a good one, everyone like puppies and kitties.
9jznbIxTaa	your bankroll needs to be approx 50 times your minimum bet.myself,i play $5.00 bets so my bankroll is $250.00.i get $100.00 in 5 chips.i start out at 1 unit which is $5.00.i have to win 10 units,which is $50.00 before i raise my bets to 2 units which is $10.00,and so on to 3 units,4 units etc...50 times ur minimum because u will have times you lose several strait hands.card counting is very distracting,unless you are very proficient.i found the hi-lo easiest for me,but basic strategy works best.just have to play strict basic strategy and not deviate until it is in your favor.|`|nQcmAFnyaa	That depends on what you want to play.<br>  If you play at tables i would say the minimum is $200, because your bets will be $1 or higher. You must have some backup money when you lose your first bet.

BCr9lPxEaa	I used to make Player World MMOs, but it was limited by how much you could do. There was no coding involved, you could set levels, create maps, add music, etc. But you couldn't edit the game engine itself so many peoples games looked very alike. It was all 2D as well.<br>  <br>  You should continue learning programming, I don't think you will find a free game engine, but there are a lot pay ones out there. I've used Torque made by Garagegames. But because i did not know how to code i couldn't do anything but play the demo and mess around with a few setting. I hope you have better luck than i did.

31v7TjzFaa	I want to go to Thorpe Park again!<br>  <br>  I suggest to wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Don't wear shorts/skirts unless you can stand the cold, it's definatly way too cold for those. Unless your wearing leggings underneath maybe. Jeans aren't good if your going to be on water rides, I wouldn't go on a water ride unless it was warm though, they usualy even have them closed if it is too cold. But if you really want to go on them wear a long jacket with a hood maybe. Jeans aren't comfortable when you get wet. It wouldn't be good to get ugg boots wet either. A skirt or dress isn't a good idea to wear to a theme park, think Zodiac. :p<br>  <br>  I would wear a long jacket with a hood, a pair of jeans and trainers or comfortable flat shoes. Keep it simple and practical. Though that's rich coming from me as I once wore heeled boots there, they weren't high though. :p<br>  <br>  Has anyone else noticed girls wearing their pjyama's there?? They are mad.<br>  <br>  Have fun whatever you decide to wear!|`|58AG1wo4aa	do not wear jeans. if too hot will give you a rash. if wet will give you rash between rash.   <br>  do you own any leggings? if so wear that with a long top and a long cardigan x

f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	We had a group of about 9 kids experiment with one when I was a teen and the house started getting pelted with some stuff hitting the roof very violently and intensely that seemed to all of us not to be humanly possible to duplicate with any manned army of people casting anything at any house or building and we tossed that demonic board out the window and left the house immediately. It scared me and all who were present and I don't believe it was a setup by the other neighborhood kids, either. The indicator did seem to be directing us and spelling out stuff and I now seriously believe it is a dangerous occult portal also. We were lucky to get rid of it and never venture back to it. The Bible says: <br>  <br>  "Ephesians 6:12<br>  <br>      * King James Version (KJV)<br>  <br>    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>  <br>  If you have ever studied anything about the Bible and about the orders of the 9 choirs of Angels in the 3 tiers that God uses to interface with others in heaven, on the earth, and between the two, you would know that those "powers" and "principalities" are his former Angels that rebelled against God when 1/3rd of all the Angels of heaven were cast down from the heavenlies into the bottomless pit with Lucifer. They are now known as Demons. It is these Demons which the Apostle Paul forwarns us of in the above mentioned scripture. I urge you all to check out a good local Bible study and learn of that great deceiver and his cronies who are assuredly very, very real and running rampant upon the earth and under the earth and even in the metaphysical unseen realm of the Ouija Board. Don't ever even play around with one!. Satan is also known as "The Father of Lies and Lord of the Flies" and he fills people with his lies through that board and many other means! <br>  <br>  Joshua 24:14-16 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   14Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.<br>  <br>   15And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<br>  <br>   16And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;|`|1HHgP3WCaa	I say no. I know there are a lot of people that don't believe in the spirit world, but when I was a teen ager I had a bad experience with some friends.

ysiE6IDjaa	You need Nightlife to be able to find or play with Vampires.<br>  You need Apartment Life to have witches in your game.<br>  They both only appear on community lots. The vampires are very easy to spot.  There are some differences to a Head Witches arrival on a lot, compared to the Vampire Count or Contessa.<br>  Where the vampire just wanders in like any other Sim, the Head Witch makes a grand entrance. They fly in on a broomstick, landing right next to the Phone booth on the Community Lot. They then proceed to cast a spell on the lot. For Good Witches, the spell makes it stop raining (if it was raining), creates a golden burst of light with jingling bells and chimes, and creates numerous butterfly or firefly spawns (depending on time of<br>  day). The Evil Witch causes it to start raining (if it isn't), creates thunder and lightning (The Lightning doesn't strike any objects like natural lightning does though), and spawns numerous cockroach swarms. After arrival, the Head Witch will remain on the lot for a sim hour, before departing, if she is not interacted with. Once interacted with, she remains on the lot like any other<br>  sim, usually casting another spell when left alone.<br>  The chances of a Head Witch arrival are altered by some situations. The Good Witch is more likely to arrive during daylight, and also when it's raining.<br>  The Evil Witch has increased chances of arriving when it's night, and not raining. This is not exclusive though. The two Head Witches can even arrive when the other is still on the lot.<br>  The important thing to remember when chasing down the initial contact with a witch is this: Community lots do have a maximum population (Which varies depending on<br>  your computer specs). If that limit is reached with no vampires or witches appearing, then there is no chance of a witch or vampire arrival until another sim leaves the lot. So, a fun lot with lots to do and plenty of autonomous needs satisfaction items, one<br>  that keeps sims happy and staying there, is not a good place to go when searching for vampires or witches. Stay away from lots with restaurants, Coffee Baristas, and group fun activities. That way you have a higher turnover of visitors, increasing the chances of a witch or vampire arriving. This is not to say vampires or witches cannot appear on lots like that, it's just that unless you are lucky enough to get an early appearance, you likely won't see one for a long time.<br>  In any case, the key thing to finding a witch or vampire is patience.  Your sims will need to spend some time at the lot.|`|ZZqUkH5aaa	With a witch or a vampire u have to find them and becoem their friend. A really easy cheat for friendship is "boolprop testingcheats enabled true"  hlod shift and click on stuff(especially sims) and u can do anything....uyse spawn and use the tombsone of L and D and say make me friendly to everyone here or after a while u can click and drag needs, skills, relationships, ect. and u can make the withc/vamp selectable and make their relationship really high....but anyways if u r reALLY good friends u can ask to b  taught magic from the witch and i think vampires just trap u, or u can make them selectable and have them bite ur sim|`|mg2BJbeAaa	I don't think there is a witch, but vampire is kinda easy.<br>  Just go to anywhere in "Downtown" at night, and look around. If a vampire shows up, you'll definately know it. They are pale white, and walk differently. <br>  If you can build up a relationship with them, they may bite you. You'll become a vampire and wont need any of your comforts maintained as long as you sleep in a coffin. Obviously, don't go outside during the day, but you can go to work in a car and survive. Once you are a vampire, you can bite others as well.

y02PZj22aa	I would run a basting stitch 1/4" from the edge and another 1/2" from the edge using a small running stitch.  Next, I would press the hem under on the 1/2" line.  Then I would gather the 1/4" line gently and evenly, finger-pressing the 1/4" hem as I gathered, then pin the hem to the veil. Once a significant portion was pinned, I'd stitch it with invisible stitches through the hem and veil.  Finally, after all was stitched, I'd remove the basting stitches.|`|fvre0o9laa	I'd shell hem it.  The edge finish is pretty and tends to hide any irregularities in turning in the hem.  See the middle diagram here on p. 46 of the excellent "Art of Manipulating Fabric".<br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Yoj3gJJpP60C&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=shell+hem&source=bl&ots=goce1UCaQH&sig=9c3TgMyg0itcl0W3AQDsJLwOBqE&hl=en&ei=AyCvSZzVA4mMsAODucR9&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=Yoj3gJJ...</a><br>  <br>  Alternatively, pink it, and baste lace over the raw edge.|`|25a903128a710f9935672e9f69763d85aa	What is the veil made of? If it is good quality tulle, and trimmed neatly, you don't have to hem it unless you want to. If its more like a sheers material that would fray, the you would need to. <br>  <br>  If it indeed needs hemming, I would use a ruler and lots of pins to pin it up the way you want it ( small hem, large hem - you don't say) folding over twice ( standard for hemming) I would then take a sharp needle and thread to match or invisible thread - think like fishing line. Just so the thread does not show if you don't want it to. I take small tacking-running stiches or button hole like stitches ( but burying most of the stitches inside the hem itself) <br>  <br>  Some people like the iron on tapes to do hems but on a veil I'm afraid they would melt and show and just be a mess. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|q5fqP31taa	Here are instructions and a graphic that will help you hem your circle veil.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shira.net/sew-hem.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shira.net/sew-hem.htm</a>

QxIhMHwAaa	I think so. The WoW world is constantly expanding and changing such that it justifies the monthly fee. Plus once you start you get drawn to the game you'll get your money's worth. You'll need to definitely exercise self-control when playing though so that you don't become addicted! Lol.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you download the free 10-day trial. You'll get a good taste for the game and then be able to decide for yourself.|`|DBIgAIBZaa	Play the free trial and find out. Be careful, It's very addicting.|`|lkxFy681aa	No.<br>  <br>  It's nothing special, plus you have to pay $40 for the game, then $15 a month.  If you stop paying, your account is wasted.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of good free MMO's that give you the option to buy stuff if you want. WoW is cartoony as well. It's a childs game.|`|T44Y0UuYaa	NO NO NO! It is NOT worth it! Trust me, WoW takes up much time, simple tasks take a couple of hours...also, once you reach the cap/maximum level if becomes VERY boring...So I only think you should sign up for it ONLY if you have the money...you have PLENTY of time and you have friends playing it already (to decrease the level of boredom...) I don't recommend WoW...it is not worth it...<br>  <br>  P.S.-The game takes friends, family members and lives away!|`|ANsznbWsaa	Well it obviously depends on how much you like it and how much you play it. My husband plays and he thinks the cost is well worth it.|`|xyOcnQjpaa	I played it for years.... And now It doesn't seem to be worth the 15 a month. You have to play this game every day to make it worth it... I will stick to my free MMORPGs and Lifetime membership to LotRO|`|IsVWy8uuaa	It really depends on what is you want to achieve in buying it.<br>  <br>  Firstly, almost all MMORPGs have free trials. World of Warcraft currently has one available at:<br>  <br>  <a href="https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial/freetrial.html." rel="nofollow">https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial...</a> <br>  <br>  I would almost always recommend that if you're unsure about a game you try it out first.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you should consider the cost of the overall game. Not only will you have to pay $15.00 a month but you will also need to buy the game itself. The current cost of WoW varies from store to store but you can take a look at Amazon or Best Buy (for instance) and check out their prices. <br>  <br>  ** Make sure to take note of the fact that there are 3 different cd/dvd packs you need to buy to obtain the full game which could add up to quite a sum of money.**<br>  <br>  In terms of whether the game is actually worth the $15.00pm subscription fee you can look at it a few ways. Once the initial cost of the game purchase is out of the way it's actually a relatively cheap hobby. You will have a game that you can play at any time pretty much endlessly until you decide you are bored. So whether you play 3 hours or 30 a week it's still the same cost at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Many players of MMOs continue to play a game for several years for at least a couple of hours an evening. It all depends on your playstyle and your other commitments. But a fair word of warning here, MMOs tend to be addictive and if you decide to play in an end game guild you will probably need to commit a significant proportion of time to achieving your goals.|`|opwyfbufaa	It's worth it if you don't quit later, it's a very cool game, nice graphics, nice environment, plus you already have people you know who play it, playing it with someone else is always more fun.<br>  <br>  I myself don't get it because I don't stick to one online game, but I enjoyed the 10 day trial , you should download the trial if still available and see what you think|`|bOpN1pJ4aa	i used to be in the same situation when WoW came out.  I played star wars galaxies for a few months and thought it was horrible,and why would anyone pay to play a game.  Well, I decided to give WoW a try and now I totally think the 15$ a month is worth it.  I just think of all the major content that's been released since I started playing over 4 years ago.  Without a payment plan, Blizzard wouldn't be able to do what they have done with WoW.|`|gvguk8deaa	Just like the above user said it all depends on your point of view. I'm also a member and I think its well worth the $15 a month for the gameplay I get out of it.<br>  <br>  Go to www.worldofwarcraft.com and download the 10 day trial, I don't believe you need to give information but it will give you and idea.|`|8Initt1aaa	Do you want a girlfriend?

AA12343169	first, if it is a boy rock, he does not want to wear a tutu. He probably should wear a leotard, that is what male dancers wear. However, I have heard rumors that some tooth fairies are male, and they are forced to wear slightly longer tutu-like skirts, so perhaps if you make a longer one, he will not mind too much.<br>  Measure your rock. You will want to have at least enough tulle to go around his middle 4 times. Now cut 3 more pieces the same length. using a needle and thread, sew a basting stitch through the top of one length, and then evenly gather the fabric along the basting stitch. Now stitch on top of it, to hold the gathers in place. Do the same with the  other 3 lengths.<br>  Measure out a length of ribbon that is twice as long around as your rock. Fold the ribbon lengthwise and press. Stack the tulle skirts on top of each other. Now find the center of the ribbon, and match it to the center of your tulle skirts. fold the ribbon over the top of the skirt, to control the tulle and protect the rock from the scratchy fabric. Sew the ribbon on to the tulle, catching both sides of the ribbon, to create a waist band. Use the ends of the ribbon to tie the tutu on to the rock. Now trim the bottom of the tutu and fluff. <br>  I know your rock will look beautiful, but he may be embarrassed to be seen in a tutu if he is not on stage, so you may want to add a mask so none of his friends recognize him. Oh, and you may try to find a nice grey tulle, or some other rockly color.|`|Bc8kmZ95aa	buy a tuny tutu, probably...tell the store clerk if they have a like, kinda small tutu for girls and if its kinda too big, shrink it into the dryer. that happened to me to my fav shirt then i couldnt wear it anymore...hate that day! <br>  =D boo hoo

jFsT066Raa	Yes, you will need to change your realmlist though. Once you have installed World of Warcraft and created your account go into the World of Warcraft folder and go to the "Data" folder. Then click "Enfr" (I think its that, should be something along the lines of that.) Next double click on Realmlist and click open with a program. Next select Notepad or Wordpad, even microsoft word would work. Next change that part that starts with "Set realmlist" to "Set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com". Save the file and start up world of warcraft. You will not be able to connect to the US servers.

j6MvCr6Naa	Of course you should get Killzone 2, it's the best FPS on the PS3 right now so there's really no better place to start your FPS playing days. Every FPS starts of slow and teaches you the basics, it will get you familiar with the game and will get harder as you go along and learn new gameplay mechanics. So don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Also, this is a very good game, with some of the best graphics ever seen in a video game, the gameplay is a lot like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (which is another brilliant FPS), so that's a good thing.

Doesn't matter i think =/|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	You should be ok, most shooters have easy or training mode which you can play through to become a frag-meister, anyway you might as well jump in at the deep end it's really isn't any fun otherwise!|`|972OdSIJaa	no unless you want to deal with the awful controls.<br>  <br>  play the demo first and see if you like it

Moneys tight times are hard, but whatever you do, DO NOT QUIT!  <br>  The only problem you willencounter when you start teaching yourself, is your going to get lazy.  Im giving you a heads up so you dont let the laziness affect your practicing.<br>  Just dont quit! keep at it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|qubLyvcRaa	If you've been taking lessons and playing for 3 years but are still having problems with chords, you're not practicing enough.  Quick change chords are a product of muscle memory (just like a good athlete needs!).  Were you equating your lesson time with practice?  If you really want to get good, you need to put in at least 30 minutes, 5 days/week.  Lessons do get expensive, but as previous answers indicated, there are a lot of good sources on the internet and in bookstores.  Our Barnes & Noble has an outstanding selection of guitar learning material.  I personally like the product from Legacy Learning systems which contains both CDs and DVDs.  It's about $200, but that's about 5 lessons.  You can work at your own pace and the lessons are well planned out.  Do yourself a favor, though.  Learn to make the best use of your time.  Guitar students have a tendency to get bored after a few minutes of lesson and start playing songs, thereby shortchanging the very valuable skill exercises the lesson wants you to practice.  For every 30 minutes of practice, give yourself 10 minutes of skill sets (running scales, etc.), 15 minutes of<br>  practicing the lesson and 5 minutes (or whatever else you want to add to the time) to song playing.  As your dexterity and speed of playing increases, these times might change.  Just be sure not to go to the following lesson until you feel totally comfortable with the one you're currently working on.  Good luck!  Maybe I'll see you at one of the open mike nights I'm always attending.

The phoning will occur, the simply dial 3625550100. Dial that number. And voila. The armour is there. After you pressed the cheats once, you can use it again by finding the cheats tab in your phone menu, like you mentioned earlier.<br>  <br>  Here are a few cheats from one of the top GTA IV fansites.<br>  <br>  <br>  Restore Niko's health.  482-555-0100<br>  Give Niko armour.          362-555-0100<br>  <br>  To get more of these cheats, go to <a href="http://www.gta4.tv/page/37/cheats/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gta4.tv/page/37/cheats/</a><br>  <br>  Besides cheats, that website will show you quite a lot, for example, Maps, random pedestrians, pigeons(Flying rats), the how-to finish the mission.

2BjcTzmAaa	Hi there.<br>  <br>  Well, there are a few reasons for this.<br>  <br>  1. You installed the game, but did not crack it. To crack, go to your entered disc drive for the Sims 2 Disc 1, then right click, open it, then find a folder called 'Crack'. Double click on it, then find an icon called 'Sims2'. Copy the icon to your installed place. For example, for mine, F:\EA GAMES\The Sims 2. Then, locate a folder called TSBin, and paste the icon you copied earlier into it. Choose to overwrite, and click yes, and you're good to go.<br>  <br>  2. If you have not installed the game yet, here's what you can do.<br>  Go to the disc drive which you had put your Sims 2 disc in it, then find an icon which looks like 'EA' and it is named 'Setup'. Double click on it, and the setup/installation will pop up.<br>  <br>  3. If either does not work, go and change your disc, there might be a flaw to the copying of the disc by the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Over, Out. -Tami-|`|0AOTN962aa	IDK....try clicking MY COMPUTER then the icon for the sims 2 then it should work

As for the best cards to bring back would have to depend on the type of monsters in your deck as well as the type of deck.|`|GJwBDD1Daa	Depends on what's in your deck & how you play it. <br>  If you have alot of monster cards and very few trap/spell cards then you'd want your trap/spell cards back.
gu3x37Muaa	Yes, if both computers have exactly the same hardware... (same specs.)<br>  <br>  But a desktop is better for the money. You will be able to play more recent games and they will perform better. If you get a laptop, you won't be able to play newer games and you won't be able to upgrade the graphic card. So if you want to play newer games, don't risk yourself and buy a desktop.<br>  <br>  I personally bought a laptop a year ago and I can't say it's that good for gaming. But I can still find older games (like 2007, 2006 ones) that will work properly. So it depends of the timeline of the games you want to play.|`|4OkCGa69aa	Usually a laptop would overheat faster causing it to lag, and since it's wireless, it could lag more so it'd be best to use a desktop|`|nCWmbgPyaa	It would probably be the same but desktop is better for gaming and price + you can update the stuff in it|`|p7bO9FwGaa	It's the same.|`|CT3t80suaa	Yes, the game itself would be exactly the same, however the laptop touchpad is horrible for gaming. You'd need a plug in mouse ( and probably keyboard too) to be able to use it.
B7tEl85naa	Try turning down the graphics, very good idea. But that might not save you from the lag. The only way you will find out is when you try it. Good luck, I hope it works.

03686ad11338d0a2cd5dec34cd0a606eaa	The online game should come included on your CD. If my memory serves me correctly then you need to download 2 patches for the game. After installing the patches comes the map downloads (of which there are many). TBH I don't think many people are playing RTCW online anymore. If I were you I'd download Enemy Territory instead. This is the standalone game that was made as an addon to RTCW but the developers didn't like it much so they put it free to download on the internet for anyone to play. It still has a very large online community and is a great game to play.|`|837xgMwLaa	You need Enemy Territory<br>  <a href="http://returntocastlewolfenstein.filefront.com/file/Enemy_Territory;14380" rel="nofollow">http://returntocastlewolfenstein.filefro...</a>

It's not like you're choosing between XBOX360 and PS3 where most of third party games cross-platforms each other. If a game was made for Wii then it usually sticks to Wii, same with PS3 games. <br>  <br>  Get the more expensive system now (PS3) and save up about the price of 5  new PS3 games and you can get yourself a Wii too. Besides, you wouldn't want to get stuck in this ugly console war where a lot of people are taking sides not because of quality of games, but by brand loyalty...which sucks.<br>  <br>  If you really enjoy games and a true gamer. You'd get all three systems, they're just about different enough for you enjoy each other's strengths.

07dEAJg9aa	All I can say is I love making decks haha.  I pretty much go onto the gatherer and search creature types till I find something that looks interesting.  Here are some of my ideas I may eventually work on:<br>  <br>  Red/Green Centaur:<br>  Green for Acceleration and main set of creatures, Red for burns and combat buffs.<br>  <br>  Black Vampire:<br>  Lots of extremely powerful flying creatures.  Since black has cards like Cabal Ritual and Dark Ritual, you should be able to accelerate them into play.<br>  <br>  Green/White Rhino/Elephant:<br>  Rhino is the new thing that Wizards are expanding on.  If you remember "Rhox" the 5/5 Beast, it is now considered a "Rhino Beast".  Rhino is all about power and some defense.  Elephant is similar.  You'll have green to accelerate and white to provide support.  Both Rhino and Elephant have white and green creatures.<br>  <br>  Red/Blue Wizards:<br>  Wizards are always fun.  Each color has wizards and each one has their own specialties.  Red is burn and sacrifice, while blue is draw and control.  Combine the two and you have another control deck.<br>  <br>  Blue Leviathan:<br>  You will most likely not see anyone with Leviathan.  It's extremely difficult to play but if you get a lot of cheap defenders, you might be able to make it work.  It will need A LOT of lands to work though.<br>  <br>  Red Minotaur:<br>  Minotaurs are pretty uncommon but they are fun to play.  They are a medium speed deck with power.  You could mix em with Elephant/Rhino if you wanted.  Might make an even better power combo.<br>  <br>  These are just some ideas.  Just search the Gatherer for the creatures that are available.  Good luck!|`|YmuK6Mcqaa	Slivers are a must have deck but my current favorite is my extended Esper deck (w/b/u).  Master Transmuter is the new Elvish Piper these days.

Messenger, sidebar, anything that takes up your virtual memory.  You might need to close them so that your machine doesn't spaz from trying to do too many things.<br>  <br>  Check the system requrements for the game.  (They should be on the box)  The problem could also be that you don't have enought RAM, or dont meet the minimum requirements for some other part.  <br>  <br>  Finally, check out what kinds of programs cause problems for the game.  Portal, for example, sometimes experiences issues while McAfee is running.  I cant say for sure what your problem is since i can't see your computer, but if you have any questions, i can try my best to help.<br>  <br>  also try nxshift's idea.  steam is kind of annoying sometimes.  Close it up first, and try to run the game seperate, assuming that it has its own launcher.

j6MvCr6Naa	I've spent a lot of hours on this game so here are some tips:<br>  <br>  1. The Psycho in the theater can be hard to kill, what you need to do is grab weapons like metal pipes and 2 x 4's, just weapons that have a very quick attack. What you should not use are weapons like baseball bats which take a long time to swing. Then when you're fighting him, get close to him and then run away, he will run after you and swing his sword, you have to try and dodge this and then quickly hit him while he's recovering after his attack. Then quickly run away, repeat until he's dead.<br>  <br>  2. To kill Adam the Clown you need to go into different shops in Wonderland Plaza and pick up the counters, then when you have a good chance, for example when he starts blowing up a balloon, throw the cash register at him to inflict massive damage. Repeat this until he's dead.<br>  <br>  3. In North Plaza the shop which is N127 on the map is a gun shop, you will find Hand Guns, Sniper Rifles and Shotguns there. I suggest you get a few Shotguns then go outside to face the Convicts. Get close enough to them so that they folloe you and run away towards a tree, stand behind it and they will run into it instead of going around, and you will be safely behind it. You can now quickly keep on running out from behind the tree and shooting them in the face until they're all dead. Make sure you go for the gunner first. By the way, when they are dead, you can drive the jeep and use the machine gun.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and have fun, Dead Rising is an awesome game and one of my favourites.

QWHpXlNCaa	go here and when you get to saefty is when this starts talking of PLC's. I did not find what type of plc it was i dont believe. it is a plc type that is used for mechanics or failure of mechanics. like breaks and such. they use these controls on kiddie rides at the carnival wether you beieve that or not. also if you put this in the search bar Intamin Accelerator Coasters type of PLC's it comes with several references of these components...all but type on a skim.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Roller_coaster" rel="nofollow">http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/...</a><br>  <br>  Safety<br>  Because roller coasters are intended to feel risky, accidents such as  ...........<br>  Many safety systems are implemented within roller coaster systems. The key to the mechanical fail safes is the control of the roller coaster's operating computers: programmable logic controllerProgrammable logic controller<br>  A Programmable Logic Controller, PLC, or Programmable Controller is a small computer used for automation of real-world processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines....<br>  s (often called PLCs). Most roller coasters run with three separate PLCs; however, only one PLC is required to detect a fault for the ride's fail-safes to be activated. This is often the reason that the ride trains may stop on the lift or the brake runs, yet after a short time the ride starts again without any obvious maintenance by staff. It is likely in such a case that one of the PLCs detected a fault by mistake, and the ride operator only needed to restart the ride.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, accidentsAmusement park accidents<br>  Amusement park accidents often result in serious injury or death to somebody visiting or working at an amusement park....<br>   do occur. Regulations vary from one authority to another. Thus in the USA, California requires amusement parks to report any ride-related accident that requires an emergency room visit, while Florida exempts parks whose parent companies employ more than 1000 people from having to report any accidents at all. Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation that would give oversight of rides to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).<br>  <br>  Ride accidents can be caused by riders or ride operators not following safety directions properly, but in extremely rare cases riders can be injured by mechanical failures. One such example was the 2006 de-railing of one car on the Wild ThingWild Thing (roller coaster)<br>  Wild Thing, located at the Valleyfair! amusement park in Shakopee, Minnesota, is a steel roller coaster out and back roller coaster roller coaster with more than one mile of track....<br>   roller coaster at Valleyfair. This accident was not a serious accident, as is with almost all roller coaster accidents. Witnesses say the back car of the train derailed just as the train was entering the final brake run, and nobody was seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  In recent years, controversy has arisen about the safety of the increasingly extreme rides. There have been suggestions that these may be subjecting passengers to translational and rotational accelerations that may be capable of causing brain injuries. In 2003 the Brain Injury Association of America concluded in a report that "There is evidence that roller coaster rides pose a health risk to some people some of the time. Equally evident is that the overwhelming majority of riders will suffer no ill effects." <br>  <br>  A similar report in 2005 linked roller coasters and other thrill rides with potentially triggering abnormal heart conditions that could lead to death. Autopsies have shown that recent deaths at various Disney parksIncidents at Disney parks<br>  This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various Disney-owned theme parks. This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park operations...<br>  , Anheuser-Busch parksIncidents at Busch parks<br>  This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various Anheuser-Busch-owned theme parks....<br>  , and Six Flags parksIncidents at Six Flags parks<br>  This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various Six Flags-owned theme parks....<br>   were due to previously undetected heart ailments.

aQTlygsCaa	The Thunder Raptor Titan is not a good place to start if you are beginning with helicopters itself. You are better starting off with a kit that is ready to fly. This way, when you crash, you could then learn how to take apart the helicopter and then fix it again. Usually people think its better to learn how to build it first, but that isn't necessarily true in this case. Not knowing how to build it usually leads to frustration and that is not good. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you get the Blade CP Pro 2 from E-flite. That is the best starting helicopter you could get or the Belt CP. Those helicopter are very simple, and the parts are at a fair price.

However, in the later parts of the game, the guards are almost always on high alert so it will be very difficult to stay anonymous and your symbol will be yellow almost all the time.<br>  <br>  When you pass a European outside a city the symbol turns red because he saw you and wants to kill you, once you get out of visual contact the symbol will turn yellow and eventually green again.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't matter if you kill somebody ans the guards see you, all you have to do is, run away, then hide somewhere and your symbol will go back to green and you can continue playing.<br>  <br>  Have fun.
mg2BJbeAaa	While I've not personally played Six, I've heard nothing but good things about it.<br>  If you've already played X, then play it again. That has a decent amount of replay value, as does XII.|`|pV5AAi4Oaa	go buy the 5 and 6 final fantasy games,u r missing out 2 new game play experience on u,then after u do that go play in the 8th final fantasy game or the 9th one,these r the best to replay again.|`|FWV0JHYsaa	go buy number 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|7Lmdrxicaa	I would have played VII or IX, those are my favourites :D

Nnm17zqxaa	sequence is a REALLY fun game when you have a lot of people playing it (example: 5-9) it is really enjoyable. i highly recommend it.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Yeah! My wife and I love it. We play on teams against our inlaws, friends, or whatever suckers we can convince to play us. I keep trying to cheat, but my wife is a goody two shoes and won't let me. I have tried signals, codes, and even plain out pointing, but once I do she rats me out and will purposefully make us lose. Damn spoil sport. <br>  <br>  Great game though. At first you think there is no real strategy, but with two people you have to have a strategy and learn fast when it is time to play defense vs offense.|`|3X8Igzhxaa	nope sorry dont know that one sounds like its good though|`|ZsF4X2g8aa	sequence is the best board game ever its so fun you end up getting addicted to it and playing until midnight. we have lots of parties and its are tradition to play sequence after dinner. the object of the game is to get one or two sequences (a sequence is 5 tiles in a row) depending on how many people you are playing with. sequence is a board game and a card game so its even more interesting to play. If you are thinking about getting it I highly recommend it it will provide you with hours of fun.
Wha1t4Sraa	You can play on any server you want. Just hit the realm button and there should be a regions tab, as well as the language, at least in the American version. But you live in Canada so there shouldn't be a problem.
slZPeDMqaa	did you check the system requirements before buying the game it might be that your computer might not be able to handle the game (shame to its an awesome game)<br>  <br>  it also could be that you have to much programs takeing up your CPU go to task manager (ctrl + alt + delete) and see if theres any processes that you dont need <br>  <br>  if you havnt thrown away the box yet then check the system requirements it will be somewhere on the box and if you dont have what the game requires you might have to return it :(|`|GpYK8gFgaa	make sure your computer can handle it, second press ctrl-alt-delete and close all other programs and close side programs that are not esentual to run your computer

Unfortunately they have gone. :( But... you can now go to Rockhoppers ship and go into his captains quarters.

j6MvCr6Naa	I totally completely agree, games are steadily getting worse and new franchises are just not as appealing as the older ones we're all used to.<br>  However, there's one game series I think you might be forgetting about and that's the Bioshock series.<br>  <br>  The original Bioshock was obsolutely amazing in my opinion, amazing graphics, brilliant story and characters, limitless gameplay and an astonishing underwater gameworld asll add up to the best game ever made in my opinion as well as my favourite game of all time.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Bioshock:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/bioshock?q=bioshock" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  It's 96%, which is spectacular, this FPS/RPG game is pretty revolutionary in my opinion and this franchise is just getting started.<br>  <br>  Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams has been announced and is going to come out in Christmas 2009.<br>  <br>  Here's the first Trailer for Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/41898.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/41898...</a><br>  <br>  The trailer strongly hints that Rapture is going to be surfeced out of the Atlantic Ocean. I can tell because you see Rapture coming out of the sand and at the end there's a butterfly on the "Bioshock 2" logo. Pretty exciting I think.<br>  <br>  So yeah, the awesome game franchises of the past are kind of dying away, but at least there's still rare games like Bioshock that come out and blow us (or me at least) away.|`|jxIV35Ljaa	no nothing this gen or last gen was as good as legend of zelda
MsU39XT2aa	gawssh.loveee that gameee=] i play likee tweennyy fourr seveeen lol.<br>  but have you ever triedd byin a new one?[call of duty world at war game,not xbox.lol]
RH8Ncf36aa	Yes. Come on most sites that aren't bribed give it a ten of ten. It represents everything GTA is meant to do on the xbox 360. Its a classic, so unless you can't stand not beating a game in under 20 hrs, get it.|`|SBcxooLsaa	yua then get lost and damned|`|2LYIMahxaa	I bought an Xbox 360 just for that game. It was worth every penny. It's great fun. Also, the mutiplayer modes are ultra fun!|`|UnK7MqMgaa	erm it has 2 out of 3. graphics and shooting. the fun doesn't last long. Stick with GTA san andreas now that is the best gta ever. soo fun.<br>  <br>   i reccomend saints row 2 also, 10x better.|`|aFPNcgIKaa	GTA4 would be great for you, it has an awesome story mode and a kick "butt" online mode.

cKi84gjsaa	I only ever found it once, it's hard to find and it moves. Its just pure luck. There is a sinking lure in Twilight Princess, To get the sinking lure after you catch and keep a Pike, Ordon Catfish, and Bass fish, go past the bridge to the left side. Near the water there should be a little brown patch in the shape of a circle. Step on it and face north and manually fish (no boat).<br>  <br>  Be sure to not select that lure if you take the boat with the fishing hole keeper on board, or she'll confiscate it and toss it back in the same spot where you can catch it once more.|`|GIDMDXsxaa	no you just walk around randomely to get it its the only way. I have never played twilight princess so i dont know.... but you could look it up easy enough
bqeBvlJ5aa	You can download it on the Xbox Live market place. The free version is, obviously, free, and the premium version is 800 microsoft points.<br>  <br>  The free version gives you a couple of gifts from knothole island, and lets you play online with someone who has the premium version. You cannot get achievements in this version.<br>  <br>  The premium version lets you actually go to knothole island on your game, do all the quests and get the achievements.
cLW7vFUGaa	Ah, there is no shovel in Harvest Moon: Magical Melody! (I totally wasn't thinking at first and had typed up a whole description of how all the basic tools should come with your house. xD)<br>  <br>  The Hoe is what accomplishes most of what you'd expect a shovel to do, like dig for things underground (Pontana Roots and Clay in the mines, truffles during the Fall season, money randomly beneath soil, etc). There shouldn't ever be a need for a shovel, so don't worry.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	there is no shovel in the game and there was never no shovel. must be a different game you are thinking of.

KUcM5UDKaa	yes you can, but some games (like halo 3) that were released before the NXE update actually run less effectively from the hard drive. newer games usually work better from the hard drive.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Yes, the new X-Box experience lets you install your games to the hard drive, but you still need the disk in the drive to play the game.<br>  <br>  You cannot install the entire game to the hard drive and play the game without having the disk in the drive.  <br>  <br>  MS don't want people going to a rental store, rent the game, install it to the hard drive, and get themself a game without actually buying the game.|`|UnK7MqMgaa	yes like seuperdork said, yyou can put them on the 360 but only play them with the disk in. It is supposed to up the speed and performance of the game but honestly it doesn't do much, if anything makes it slower and uses up lots of gb. <br>  <br>  I thought the same thing first, was like i am gonna rent so many games and then burn them to the hard drive only to be let down :)|`|GpYK8gFgaa	You can't install but in rare cases you can play them through your computer

There are a TON of great kits out there.   Have fun!|`|WA80AAipaa	Aerotech, Dr. Rocket, Animal Motor Works, Rouse-Tech, Cessaroni, Ellis Mountain, and Loki Motorworks are all good brands|`|cOVXHFUVaa	If you're going for absolute altitude, I'd suggest the Estes Hi-Flyer. You can get it very cheap online, or if you have a Hobby Lobby close to you, you can print out the 40% off coupon from their website and get it for under $10. It's an easy skill level 1 build, and on a C6-5 or C6-7 it will go INCREDIBLY high (1700 feet).<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you'll probably want a few other people with you to help track it, as well as a big field for recovery.<br>  <br>  Once you make your way into mid-power, your choices increase tenfold.|`|hFvvj0mUaa	Get the Estes  "BIg Bertha", it is is to build and fly's well.
jM7CyxQzaa	Definately a 'dollfie' which is short for 'doll friend' or 'doll figure' depending on which source you believe. However this is a bit of a misnomer and their technical term - in the fandom is 'Asian Ball Joint Doll' or ABJD or just plain BJD.<br>  <br>  Dollfie is a term coined by the first makers of these dolls, which are a company called Volks, based in Japan, people tend to use Volks terminology throughout the whole fandom now, including the names SD and MSD for size descriptions. People know what it means and that's how it started.<br>  <br>  I have several of these dolls and they're really lovely.<br>  <br>  They come in three sizes SD - which means 'super dollfie' are around 50cm high, Mini Size Dollfie or MSD which are around 40 cm high and tinies which are smaller than MSD and probably the ones you may have come accross given your size quoted in your other post.<br>  <br>  I'd try this site to get into the Dollfie fandom <grins> there is no escape....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.denofangels.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.denofangels.com/forums/</a><br>  <br>  I'm Sue over there, come say hi.|`|IhtbWbJpaa	I think dollfie?|`|veox4deNaa	i think they are called diddy dolls

PZT4wyGoaa	Well, I hope you're talking about games to play with guys and girls.  I know this game where you have an ice cube in your mouth.  It usually is more fun in warm weather, but whatever.  Girls get in their bikinis, guys get in their swim shorts.  So anyway, with the ice cube in your mouth, you run it up and down each other, and wherever it gets to the point it's melted completely, that's where you have to keep kissing for as long as it took for the cube to melt.  It's so fun.

jFsT066Raa	You need to visit a weapon/armor vendor. When you trade one of these vendors there's a "Repair" option next to the buyback menu. Repairing all of your items will restore them back to their same old properties and they will once again be visible.|`|Bw18seFqaa	they  broke.. you need to repair your weapons and armor..  they take damage too when you are injured or die.  You took too much damage, and did not repair your items.<br>  <br>  To repair your items, go to a town.  A blacksmith, weapon vendor, or armor vendor can ussually repair..   you can tell by moving your curser over the character, if you see an anvil, they do repairs.|`|4497c6dc731379c86f30d6bc80555f50aa	They broke. 25% X  4=100% which means your items are gone.<br>  you died 3 or 4 times didn't you?
H9aRrB6oaa	Actually the Paladin is often one of the slowest classes to level. Anways there is no definitive BEST as that would give an advantage to certian players who chose that race/class combo. If you want you can go to worldofwarcraft.com and search through their various forums to decide which sounds the best to you. <br>  <br>  It is all a personnal preference. Experiment with the classes.<br>  Some of the more common combinations are:<br>  Night Elf Hunters<br>  Blood Elf Paladins<br>  Undead Mages<br>  Tauren Druid (maybe a great choice for a beginner as they can be like warriors, spell casters, or healers and they are easier to level)<br>  Dwarf Hunters<br>  Dranei Shamans<br>  Troll Priests<br>  and several others<br>  Good luck! If you want to contact me (having 18 months WoW practice) please email me at bparson017@yahoo.com|`|mg2BJbeAaa	There really isn't a strongest per se, it's almost like an advanced rock-paper-scissors game. Paladin beats Rogue beats Warlock beats Paladin kind of thing.<br>  Easiest to level is either Paladin or Warrior. The best leveling area is easily the Blood Elf area, as the reward for killing Dar'Khan in Ghostlands is godly at that level.<br>  If you are new to the game, play a Blood Elf Paladin for a bit, then try a few others until you know what you like. Just remember to always log out in an inn or major city so you get rested xp bonus.|`|FZjhVpQCaa	nightelf hunter
jFsT066Raa	Dungeons (instances) have set levels for monsters. Such as deadmines contains monsters from level 15-25. Your armor contributes to the amount of damage that these monsters deal on you. If you're a warrior or a paladin, your armor is far more protective, however a mage, warlock, or priest wears cloth so their armor is weaker and not as resistant towards damage.|`|s385zhsHaa	Each dungeon has its own difficulty, no matter what level or skill you are.<br>  <br>  Dungeons in Outland and Northrend can be played on Heroic Mode, which scales the difficulty higher for max level characters.|`|sqUVjpElaa	If I understand you correctly, the mobs in dungeons have a set level and qualities, and independant of players who go into those dungeons.|`|JRRsjByCaa	no, their all programmed at the same level they are as if you went into a place say at level 15 and went back at level 17. theres no change in enemy level, thats why there are more dungeons as you get to a higher level and the low level dungeons disappear from your looking for group thing.

jFsT066Raa	Oysters are not a very good way of making money, but if you insist. I'd say the best way to get oysters is to kill rock crabs. These are located north of camelot, at the Freminik province.<br>  A better way of making money would be to fish lobsters (this requires 40 fishing). A great place for fishing lobsters is at Catherby, next to Camelot.

2BjcTzmAaa	Hi there.<br>  <br>  Well, i got that last time.<br>  <br>  1.I think you could try to reinstall the whole game.<br>  <br>  2. Did you crack? (Sorry, did not play that game quite a long time, did not know whether there is a crack or not, if there is, crack it.)<br>  <br>  3. Did you install your graphic card driver? For example, i use nvidia geforce 1234, find the Geforce 1234 disc in your box. Install it.<br>  <br>  Hope this works, as i got it last time, and all of a sudden its okay again.<br>  <br>  Not sure what happened.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Over, Out. -Tami-
THb23TByaa	If you get you're energy cards fast enough, he's pretty hardcore.
opwyfbufaa	Bin and Cue files are CD/DVD image files , like the guy above said, you can use Daemon Tools to emulate the the bin file as a Virtual disc, and it will auto load like if you just inserted an original game disc, you just follow the install instructions, it it ask for a serial, you right-click on the disc located on My Computer, and click Open, inside there should be a folder containing the crack and serial, use the serial, then after it finish installing, grab the other file inside the crack folder and paste it on the installation folder, though if the serial is not in there, maybe it is on the forum or site you download it from <br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Edit:   You dont need to convert, Daemon tools can read Bin files, if there are two bin files, must mean the game has 2 discs|`|z4KDb5l3aa	You gotta get a program like Daemon Tools or Alcohol to emulate the .ISO image you downloaded.<br>  <br>  (Convert the .BIN to a .ISO with a converter)|`|o2GuhJCQaa	Is the file itself a .zip? Cos if thats the case, you need to go into the folder and extract files (:
QZbNQwP6aa	i can give you a  magby and elikid
3ourvbHoaa	once you get the trophy you get you can`t lose all the trophies by creating a new game(but if you`re creating a new account yes,you`ll have to do it all over again|`|R7AYASQRaa	Yes you can, just dont delete your file with the original trophies.
mg2BJbeAaa	1. Always be working on a quest. Don't mindlessly grind.<br>  2. Level your first aid and try to always have food. Preferably have a high cooking skill too as the cooked food is outstanding for leveling.<br>  3. Stay in Fury. Titan's Grip is so amazing for PvE and PvP it isn't funny. Great for leveling too, though you need to find 2 2h.<br>  4. Save up your money for a flying mount and cold training. There is nothing in the auction house worth buying if you don't already have a flyer and cold training.|`|GjNXdeupaa	Well, you should be in nagrand or blades edge now, then when your 68, you can go to northrened and you will train in Borean Tundra and Howling Fjord to start off. In Howling Fjord there is an instance called Utgarde Keep, if you like instancing to level up, do that because there is an axe that drops there. You should switch between Borean and HF until 72, then you can go to Dragonblight. You should stay there  until 74 then you can go to Grizzly Hills until 75 or 76 and then Crystalsong till 76, and Zul'drak till 77 or even 78 if your a good quester and you get lucky. At 77 you have 3 places to choose from, Sholazar Basin, Storm Peaks, and Icecrown. Do Sholazar Basin for AS LONG AS YOU CAN!!!! and then you should do Storm peaks, and finally move on to Icecrown for the win!<br>  <br>  As for tips: Make sure you get as much rest as possible, when you stop playing, make sure your toon rests overnight<br>  <br>  -you must do as many quests as possible!!! I know some people find this part boring but it is the most efficient way to level!<br>  <br>  - If you want to do an instance, try to pick up at least 2 quests.. otherwise.... not much xp there...<br>  <br>  -One more thing, if you really want to level fast, you must follow the path i told you about, if you go to a new area before you should, and you run out of quests to do there now you have no place to go because the quests in the previous area are too low!!<br>  <br>  -good luck!!!|`|xmulMOYraa	I would suggest you make sure your talent points are set at dps not tank and then just do quests as much as possible.|`|SBcxooLsaa	train in pvp
ER3DRi1Raa	<a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?sku=200391" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductD...</a><br>  <br>  Yes, it will help.|`|Lxk7Gy1maa	I think i saw somewhere before that unlike most other rts games for the xbox 360, it will have online 2-player AND 2player with just one consule.
Z0odTlyQaa	They give you 2 options. They will send you a prepaid shipping box OR they can email you a prepaid shipping label (you provide the box).<br>  <br>  We've done the electronic shipping label 2 or 3 times now and it has gone smoothly. I would recommend that option (as long as you can print the label and find a box), because I have heard people complain about how long it took to receive the prepaid box.|`|6GIrW5eWaa	Going to answer a question with a quesiton. What did Microsoft tell you? If you haven't called them yet  you need to. Depending on if it is or is not in warranty will tell if they send the box or if you print out a lable and get your own box. So basically if warranty they send a box with packaging material and instructions. If out of warranty it's on you my friend. Good Luck|`|mVMMhboYaa	Well u can simply put it in a box and yes u need a box. Well that was before im not sure my friend told them about his brokn 360 they sent him a box with a **** load of things inside. But im pretty sure u need to give them a box. Sorryy if i sound retarded|`|bRJRKBn1aa	yes. u have to. like lets say u broke ur 360 u have to put it in a box because u have to keep the product secure.|`|Lxk7Gy1maa	They give you a box, which is now collecting dust in the corner of my room xD
26bf3fd35c715fb12b9f6a291892831eaa	Yes. Games stimulate the mind and the body. Like in DotA. It helps you think strategies so that you could farm and kill and push. And it also bonds friends, and other people playing the game. And you could learn many things in games, like helping each other (cooperation), military strategies (i think it could be applied to real life), reaction time and common sense (whenever there is an ambush in DotA) and doing math (knowing how much gold to be spent). It's also like chess, that you think where you must move, so that you could get more gold, or escape an ambush.|`|rBWm8pPuaa	Games are a fun way to learn things but it depends what you play and how serious you play it, I'm a big fan of MGS and FPS games usually military types of games but you don't see me grabbing a .45 Operator and shooting random people in the streets... lol games are games they can be used for the for good or bad its all up to you and how you use them.|`|bRJRKBn1aa	yes. i can give u many reason of y game playing is good of me. <br>  i believe that game playing is fun<br>  i learned more from games then i learned from school<br>  can contact with friends(ps3)<br>  for example god of war helped me learn a little about greek history<br>  also many toher games help u learn about things.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	DotA is fun. DotA requires skill and practice to do well in it. DotA requires teamwork to succeed.<br>  DotA is a game. It is neither good nor bad when played in moderation.
TdyI4VWzaa	GTA4: Lost And The Damned :D<br>  <br>  (Its an expansion pack for GTA 4 although its like a seperate game).<br>  <br>  Some more great games ive played are:<br>  <br>  - Oblivion<br>  - Bioshock<br>  - Saints Row 2<br>  - Bad Company<br>  - Viva Pinata (Trouble In Paradise)<br>  - Halo 3<br>  <br>  And quite a few more!|`|opwyfbufaa	Like  Douie said <br>  GTA4, Fable 2 and Halo3 , awesome Xbox 360 games, great replay value|`|x5o5ip44aa	The best games ive ever played are Gears of War 2, Assassin's Creed, and Hitman: Blood Money<br>  -Hope it helped|`|IX76wkOsaa	halo 3 , fable 2 and gta 4|`|z4KDb5l3aa	STREET FIGHTER 4!|`|BXOOnxXgaa	COD 5 WaW and Halo 3|`|AA12043690	shawn white snowboarding, or gears of war|`|Lxk7Gy1maa	i would have to say Left 4 dead or army of two.|`|c8OuBRGdaa	Saints Row 2|`|O0fPCN5Naa	call to duty 4<br>  halo 3|`|SBcxooLsaa	halo 3, gears of war 2, or call of duty world at war|`|7L97pDMLaa	Halo 3,Gears of War 2,Mirrors Edge, and Rock Band 2|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	Gears of War II|`|B014bUFuaa	CoD 4.|`|ER3DRi1Raa	Hm... probably Halo 3 or CODWaW.<br>  <br>  Rock Band 2 is pretty good too.
j6MvCr6Naa	You have to finish The Crucible and then do a few more main story quests to get to Wraithmarsh, once you get passed Wraithmarsh and then get into Bloodstone, you will be able to go back to Brightwood and only then will the Gargoyle be gone. So you have to wait a while before you can get The Daichi, sorry.|`|yc6S4iHDaa	Strange. Destroy the gargoyle?
mVMMhboYaa	The best ps3 game would have to be killzone 2.. I mean like the graphics are killer. Cod Waw isnt bad but eventually you'll get bored of it trust me.. So the best game i suggest to you is Kill Zone 2 just check out some videos at youtube and youll fall in love with it|`|1kX0nV5Qaa	madden 2009|`|SBcxooLsaa	if you want online play you should have got xbox 360 but the best are killzone 2 and cod world at war

ye9h5jXvaa	You should be able to play it just fine. Here's a link to the official Xbox website that tells you what you need to do in order to be able to play old Xbox games on your 360:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/backwardscompatibility_old.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/backward...</a><br>  <br>  You must have a 360 that has a hard drive. Then you just need the game. Of course, if it's a PAL 360 then you'll need a PAL copy of Armageddon, but I'm sure you already know that. = )|`|bRJRKBn1aa	mortal kombat armegedon is only for ps2.

xmulMOYraa	No you cant. WOTLK is the highest one out right now and in order to play that content you have to have all the other ones like the orginal and BC. There is no way to just play WOTLK unless you have a toon that is in that level range and in order to get them there you have to go through all the content.|`|8uWUWr3waa	Sorry no you need to buy WoW the original copy then Burning crusades then you can play WotLK.

Z0odTlyQaa	I don't know, that seems like a scam to me. In the game rooms, people always say in chat "Free gems, go to such and such website"<br>  <br>  I have never gone to the sites though because Pogo sent out a warning about people trying to get your Pogo password that way.<br>  <br>  I finally just bought some gems from Pogo for the first time, the other day.<br>  <br>  Don't you think they should let you buy Gems with your tokens???
