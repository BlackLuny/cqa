FZKFLTyLaa	Are you like the only person in your school who has a crussh on someone? <br>  If not your nervousness and such are pointless.<br>  <br>  2. does he llike me?<br>  Umm someday, when you're old enough or willing enough, just ask him!
AA11909552	He probably knows by now, but I recommend that you talk to him more and more. Eventually, this could develope into an everlasting friendship that could blossom into an intensely awesome relationship.<br>  Just be friendly. Make nice comments on things like his clothes, or hairstyle. Us guys like to be complimented.<br>  Do not rush to the end of the story by projecting the end result. Take it in steps. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither could your relationship with him. Have confidence and a positive outlook. You will do fine with him. Just do not be shy and who cares if he can tell that you like him. That would just-only be a good thing.<br>  Hope it works out for you!
AA11909552	For starters, you could speak about the weather. That is a 'classic' ice breaker.<br>  An entire discussion could get started just-by-that alone. Don't be scared.<br>  He would probably *definitely* appreciate talking to you. Depending on where you see him most, you could ask a question of what he thinks about what's going on at the time around you two. You can start a conversation on just-about anything. Just don't be afraid! The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.<br>  Perhaps you could make a friendly comment about what he is wearing, or his hair style, or the thing that attracts you the most. It is very simple, really. Just be bold and do not worry about rejection, cos he would probably love the attention. Who wouldn't?<br>  Good luck!
N7gOE1btaa	Just a tip bud, you are 14--don't be descibing yourself and putting your email address over this site.  Be careful!<br>  To answer your question, generally your feelings are attributable to being too young for a relationship.  You want one for some reason, but mentally aren't prepared for one.  I know it wasn't the advice or answer you wanted, but its likely very true.
Lx3tIOPeaa	thats like asking 50yrs ago "how would we get to the moon?" the reality is we dont know or you wont know until you're confronted with the situation, in the end it's all theory and in practice is much different, not much advice but i dont think many of us can answer this question. good luck|`|uiGx0rPVaa	As you know already I have a similar situation. Here's what I did:<br>  1. Talk to your friends about it<br>  2. Here's a fun idea! Write him a letter (use a different handwriting,) give it to your friend, she'll give it to the guy, and you have snail mail! :)<br>  3. How old are you both? If you guys are like 13 then WTF have YOU been thinkin'?? If you're not sneak to a festival or something during the day. (NEVER night.)<br>  4. This might sound strange but do fun creative stuff to your make up or wardrobe etc to get ready when u next see him.<br>  <br>  It's like Romeo and Juliet... Have the same prob. :(|`|AWiOeNLiaa	have u seen or read the book or seen the movie romeo and juliet?is sounds like ur problem|`|69qn7muFaa	I'd try to remember the good memories we had. <br>  I'd probably cry every night because I went one day without talking to him and I had a mental breakdown.|`|uLHtXibRaa	i'd go nuts....
AA11909552	Perhaps you should just back off a bit more and "date him" only once in a while. Eventually, this could evolve into an amazing relationship, but it sounds like you two need more space than others do. At least on your end of the deal.<br>  Maybe Brad is just not the one for you. Perhaps you should make an attempt to date someone else for a while. This could help you to figure out if your feelings for Brad are genuine.<br>  Good luck!

In the meantime you can help reduce the amount of your grocery bill with www.thegrocerygame.com|`|AA11373979	I would get a second opinion from another case worker.

sK6mrNVqaa	tell him you do not like it when he does that, if your shy and dont want to be so blunt, just cross your arms or pull your legs to ur chest and hug them with one hand and hold his hand closet to you,<br>  or hold both of his hands on ur lap so he wont keep tryin to make a move.|`|T1QdO9Xgaa	maybe pull his arm away but give him a wink at the same time? he should get the hint but it's not like you're blowing him off....it just kinda says not here, not now|`|dbKj55akaa	Tell him it is uncomfortable and to STOP. If he doesn't, leave.|`|WP4Y8aRGaa	Wow! Tell him you aren't ready for that!  He needs to respect you if he's going to be your boyfriend, and if you aren't ready for something then he shouldn't force it on you.  So i think you better tell him straight up even if you feel bad about being rude, beacuse it's your right!  And if he keeps it up after you tell him then you should dump him cuz he's only after one thing.  Hope I helped =)
HksTtfNgaa	yes he does like you =]|`|p7ovk4z9aa	he is shy,sure,you can begin a talk with him,he wanna talk to you,but he doesn't have the courage,well,little boy,~~~|`|CeVvhTckaa	yes he likes you and doesnt<br>  want to make it seem obvious<br>  hes also probably shyy cuz<br>  ur younger than him

dbKj55akaa	Good, I hope you feel guilty! That is a horrible and disrespectful thing to do when you have a girlfriend!|`|BMb30AzAaa	Haha.<br>  The deal is your hormones are ******* raging right now. Don't even worry about it. It's completely normal. It will also keep happening until that girlfriend of yours finally puts out. It will probably keep happening even if you two are having sex, though. It's just a normal desire in teenage boys.|`|fc90e62037255a555ae747139422893faa	Of course its ok. You have to blow off steam somehow. As for the guilt? Who are you hurting? No one. My husband still watches porn and whacks a few out when I'm out of order every month. We've been together for six years and I have never considered it bad or gross of him. As a matter of fact, some girls like to watch and even help. You really shouldn't feel guilty. Anyone who told you this is wrong or that you should be ashamed has no clue what they were talking about. So, normal guy...go have fun and make sure the porn is worth watching. I do love a good one myself...lol.
AA11909552	I do not know where you got this information, but not everyone thinks this way.<br>  Being a virgin is a very beautiful thing and one should not feel pressured into having sex. Sex is overrated and is something that should not be just 'given away'.<br>  But you are talking about quality of a virgin in the sack. Hmmm... Every persons sexuality is unique in its own respect. Being a virgin does not necessarily mean that they are going to be horrible at it. They are just-only not as experienced as a ****, or a whore is and that is *nothing* to be proud of. Just tell the people that think this, they are insane and know nothing on what they are talking about.<br>  Virgins are for guys who get the honor to be the one that got the gal to have her *first* sexual experience and is commonly considered within Western culture to be an important life event and a "rite of passage".<br>  The virgin should *NOT* do it just to "do it". It should be a very SPECIAL thing for a VERY special guy.
Qbczt3ivaa	Im a little thrown off that your not engaged/married, or your planning to share your lives with each other. Is he a friend or a boyfriend? Anyways, If he constantly makes excuses for leaving you with his kids, then you should talk to him about your NEEDs. Im sure you have things to do and places to go, and its kind of unfair that he expects you to do the work. Maybe you can try to work something out while each having time to yourselves. If you feel he is taking advantage of you, then you have the choice to leave him(only if it is bothering you)<br>  But the best adviice is to talk to him about it, see what he says, and then decide what to do about it. Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Sara<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Its very kind of you to look after his kids while their mother is a Rx abuser :)<br>  <br>  Also, if your gut is telling you something, it is usually right
mpeNGJmGaa	You seem like a really nice guy who actually cares about the girl.  Girls really like a sweet guy, just be yourself; give it a little more time, you wouldn't want this girl to be scared if you asked her out immedietly.  Make sure that you are not overly nice either, just be yourself!! (again) haha.  If you are getting a good vibe from this girl and you know her pretty well after a while try asking her out :) I mean it never hurts to try right?? <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|2RzCfC1Qaa	I think you have some okay chances just talk to her a lot in person instead of myspace.Internet can ruin relationships.|`|jAG90qTzaa	hahahahahhahahahhahahahah<br>  this is funny <br>  but go for it|`|uiGx0rPVaa	YES.. Is there a dance soon? Maybe invite her?
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Sounds like he wants to do drugs without anyone nagging him.  Just forget him.  If you haven't spoken to him since you broke up, then there's no reason to start.  I know you're worried and you care about him but there's nothing you can do unless he wants to change.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	i think you should  get him some help like A.A you know....<br>  <br>  can you please answer my question ?<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions the first one that says <br>  <br>  "HElP!!!!advice....."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|xutAEx7Faa	if all he is doing is smoking weed you have nothing to worry about. if he dose it like twice a day for months, then start to get worried. once a week? thats harmless. dont forget, marijuana is only a plant...|`|7eNT1wl0aa	talk to him dude if you love him.<br>  <br>  Just dont try to talk him out of it so much i mean that makes the guy feel like your trying to run his life|`|BKr3y30maa	I think you should go talk to him.  What do you have to lose?  He already broke up with you.  The worst thing that can happen is that things stay the way they are now.  I would ask him if his weed smoking was the reason why he broke things off.  If he says it was the reason, do you think you could get back together with him and not nag him about the weed smoking?  If you think you could let that slide, then tell him.  But if you honestly don't want him doing it and you can't live like that, then you really need to move on.  Nothing wrong with that.  It's clearly obvious that you love this guy very much....and I hope for your sake, everything works out for you.
az0KD0POaa	Tell her. Email  this post to her so she can read what you and everyone has to say.<br>  <br>  I'm in my mid-40s and guys still make me feel "STUPID" when I'm in love. It's never easy to tell them when you don't know if they feel the same way.

Qbczt3ivaa	wow you seem like your really in love with her...sorry about her new boyfriend...It looked like she really liked you. If you asked her out, she would probably say yes, telling from the signs she gave you. It might take a while for you to get over her, but you can at least try to wait for them to break up. Most relationships end after a couple of months. If they break up, go up to her, take her hands, and tell her exactly what you told us right now(how your incomplete without her, shes smart, sweet, ect) then kiss her! Im telling you, she will love it, that is if she feels the same way. For now, all you can pretty much do is give it some time, and hope that it works out between you two.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Sara|`|ZzGLotRVaa	i think you should simply tell her that you really like her. Don't make it into a big deal when you first tell her. If you see her in the hallway just walk upi to her and say " (whatever her name is) i really do like you and i have for a long time" and then go to class but make it so you only have a second to tell her and then don't act like its a big thing. Don't go looking for her. Let her come to you and don't make it seem like anything in different until she says anything about it. If she doesn't say anything about it then don't mention it again. That's when you know you have to move on. To do this you should just try to go somewhere new weather its on a vacation or just a new restaurant or hang out and try to meet someone new. Someone who is pretty and smart. I am sorry to say that you will never be completely over her. You will not be able to completely forget her but you can find someone better.|`|sy40JGgTaa	well you sound like a great guy, but i guess you kinda missed your turn.<br>  you'll slowly get over her since you love her so much.|`|iX7cuwlsaa	haha maybe you should just tell her what you just told us, or wait untill they break up if your patient enough|`|5bt3ujJraa	Your so cute<br>  Ive never seen or met a guy like you<br>  youve got such a good heart<br>  <br>  to answer ur question<br>  i think in math when u see her<br>  just be str8 out with her say this<br>  <br>  <br>  "What would u do if i told u ive been in love with u from the very 1st day i saw u"<br>  <br>  She will probly be speechless and shocked to hear it. but i honestly think it will work out. Listen buddy take a risk. It really might work out<br>  Goodluck .Email me i need 2 talk 2 u urgently|`|mpeNGJmGaa	wow! that is sweet how you like that girl so much right now.  dude no one said life was easy, but life is 1% what happens to us, and 99% how you deal with it.  I'm sorry first off I can tell you are seriously heartbroken and I'm touched to hear it, really.  What I would start of by doing is seperate yourself from her, if you can't stand to watch her kiss her boyfriend then don't hang out with her as much.  You need to start caring more about yourself also.  Life is full of change and I know it's difficult but there are so many more people out there!! You're right you may never feel the same way about another girl as you did this one, but you may find one who makes you feel even better than before!! You need to start working on you and do what makes you happy find other girls to hang out with!! I can tell you shouldn't have trouble at all, I mean you're a soccer player for god sakes who wouldn't be attracted??!! As for the girl if you see the girl, be nice be her friend, but stay far away!!  Also boyfriends don't last forever (most of the time) so later she may still be your soul mate.  But do not do anything with this girl if she has a boyfriend, because for example if you hooked up with her you'd probably feel worse after because she probably wouldn't talk to you for a long time and she'd go back to her boyfriend right after and pretend the two of you never happened.  If you need anymore help you can always ask me.  This is probably the longest answer I've ever written on this also because I truly care about your situation lol, well fate has its plans don't worry too much, because what the future holds is even better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|19jVm7edaa	Get a new girl...

c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Wow I hope this isn't real.<br>  If it is, then no.  Excuse the corny reference, but you need to have a revelation and let your heart grow a few sizes too big like the Grinch.  I'm sorry women have turned you down and disappointed you over the years, but thats no reason to hate all of them.  Not all women like jerks.  What women like is confidence and unfortunately a great many "confident" men are unkind, cocky and abusive.  You really need to get back out there and stop giving men a bad name.  Stop being bitter, regretful and apathetic.  I mean, what kind of man watches another man beat up a woman and does nothing?  You don't have sisters do you?  Look I don't know how old you are, but you mentioned school so I'm guessing your anywhere from 16-25.  Life gets better as you grow older and people become more mature.  Don't give up and let yourself sink into apathy.  Thats no way to live.

Shy girls have the most inside<br>  them than any other girl. (maybe emo or cut-throat, but thats another topic.) Ask her everyday if there's anything bothering her, and an arm around the shoulder will make her feel more comfy. If she doesn't want<br>  to, tell her that you won't tell anyone and that everything is safe with you. (cuz it is, right???)

AA11620807	Dammm! I was gonna say "mr. happy."!     As for where to put your hands, the rule of thumb would be to explore by touch, the parts of us you find visually appealing.  Grasp his back like when makin whoopie, run them down our back, butt, arms, shoulder.  Make it clear you find him attractive by using touch. <br>  <br>     -t may sound wierd, but kissing or licking a guys nipples is hot too. Sucking on his fingers is INCREDIBLY arousing and suggestive.  Kissing, nibbling ears and neck, chest, moving downwards towards, but not QUITE to the General is a tease, but an effective one.  Really, its a lot similar to what women like, but with more gentle and subtle overtones.|`|ZV9LBsMJaa	well while my girlfriend kisses me she runs her fingers through my hair that turns me on guys usually like that or sometimes on their arms.<br>  <br>  - kyle

She was so Gullible yet it  was very wrong to do.<br>  <br>  This could always be a real note, but it sounds a bit cheesey to be real.  Wait some more.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	thats creepy...it definitely sounds fake|`|Ddfff5psaa	I would not act on it.  It could be real, it most likely is not.  I went to a school like yours (described), and it is common that cruel jealous girls or stupid boys would love to do pull a joke like this.  I don't think highschool boys are that romantic also.  Just becareful, you wouldn't want to make a fool of yourself.  Plus, if it is real, the guy will say something about it.

I have found this out by having friends. There are girls out there who are not like that, but you might have to search. And people who are looking for love on the internet are probably doing so because they are not having much luck in the 'real world.' This is probably because of 'said issues.' You can hide stuff about yourself on the internet and keep it a secret for much longer than otherwise, so they choose to seek relationships in which they revel in an amount of privacy.

If he dosent change, ditch him...|`|fBJ89X7yaa	Well he may be possessive but how much away are you from marriage? If you are going to get married soon why is he low on confidence? He is anyway going to get you?<br>  <br>  Well if you have years ahead of marriage, then talk to him he cannot force you. Tell him you may get even a better guy than him,  Its a fact right? Why should you fall for a guy who wants you to be his belted dog?  Break for heaven's sake! But talk to him about how serious you feel its time he listens or you are breaking with him.<br>  <br>  If he respects you he should change else show him the door!  Good luck to you!|`|VjX7bV50aa	Wow. That guy has issues. I don't know if it's because he is so insecure of himself or probably behaving just like his dad (maybe his dad behaves like that with his mother and ur boyfriend learned from his dad). He sees u as his property - PRIVATE property. Only mines and no one else. Regarding him changing, very unlikely. He already set his way of thinking, the way he sees women.

I doubt he'll change. But try talking to him, maybe the fear of losing you will change him.|`|41S75G5Eaa	what a clingy little ******!|`|xJZSpsRhaa	Yes and No.  I've never had a girl tell me that I can't look at other girls or talk to them.  However, I did have one girl, where i made a comment about another girl being cute.  She totally got pissed off.  I asked her what the difference is between commenting on someone that's real and someone that's fake (movie stars).  She said that the person that's real, is real and that there could be a more likely hood of me meeting up with that person then say a movie star.  <br>  <br>  But, some dudes are going to be crazy.  Honestly, if you break up with him, your probable going to need a re-straining order against him.  He just sounds like that type of dude.   But, then again, maybe your just a flirt :P <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ZzGLotRVaa	i would say break up with him. You cant let him control you. I would freak out if my boyfriend tried that ****. i mean there is a difference between being jealous and being crazy|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well yes I have and I say break up with him because for one your not happy and also because he can't go around trying to control you I believe that as long as their just friends that anyone in a relationship(guy or girl) are allowed to be friends with whoever they choose. This kind of behavior could (not always but could) end up to be dangerous.|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	Oh it will get worse. Eventually he's gonna start blaming you for the attention you get and he will more than likely turn violent towards either you or them. Most likely you since he's prolly an insecure p8ssy.|`|AuthyG9Qaa	No person should TOTALLY control somebody else.<br>  <br>  You are NOT his slave.<br>  <br>  Ditch him ASAP.|`|59cnZfTeaa	Dump him

I know you must be in grade school still and you're testing out who your best friends forever will be but trust me she won't be there in the long run. it seems you have a good heart and she simply doesn't. theres nothing you can do really. hopefully that girl is strong enough to do something about it. don't make this your problem. just walk away from your so called frined and don't look back. im 22 and ive found my forever friends. they have old souls just like mine and they understand life and would never ever hurt someone for fun. live and let learn :) be happy, smile and who knows, you could end up being forever friends with the girl being "terrorized."|`|SD655BkFaa	ur friend sounds horrible. if she doesnt get the hint that u want her to stop shes just a mean person....

But after two days, I changed my mind, because I developed a crush on someone else.<br>  <br>  Thing is, follow your heart. And from what I've read, it seems your heart is telling you that for now, he is only a friend. Keep it that way hun. If things change, then you can always ask him out. But don't go out with him if you're not attracted to him. You shouldn't settle on love darling, you should feel it.

ZzGLotRVaa	if she takes special time for you then there is obviously something there. If she ever just stares at you or when you are talking about something kinda Intimate and she get quiet then she probably likes you and she just doesn't know how to tell you or she is waiting for you to tell her. You could just ask her out but make sure you point out that you don't want to mess up your friendship and that you only want to date her if she feels it would be better than staying friends and if you both think it will work.|`|CX5RGqZuaa	Relax just flirt with her and stuff, hey whats the worst that can happen that she says no? If swhe does just brush it off and continue your friendship like it was. If she says yes then all power to you dude good luck!|`|rtTgkO4Naa	try asking her to the movies as just a "casual" get together. if she immediately says yes, then that's a sure sign she likes you, if she hesitates you can always be like I'm also going to invite (insert names here).|`|HksTtfNgaa	go up to her and aske her|`|THXHdIfGaa	ask her she seems interested.

All the other girls would flirt with him right away, but he said that he liked me because I was different.<br>  Also, he said because I'm not easy. Like, I didn't throw myself at him. I made boundaries and I stuck by them.<br>  <br>  - Essentially, I was myself. Don't go changing for the boys hon, you'll find someone who loves you for YOU, just as I have. (:
p1BLbINuaa	don't listen to Jak. He's an asshole. He answered my questions and made me feel like ****... You look great|`|xufESx85aa	I can't get the pic. to work. It keeps saying "oops"
qMnuRO50aa	Because the two are like polar opposites, even more so than white/black couples|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	It's true. You don't see a lot of those huh? I think it's because black girls go for black guys a lot. But their kids turn out AMAZING so I don't really know. I'd go for an asian guy myself|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well I believe it's rare because not a lot of Asian males like Black girls or vise versa and people think things to be odd or wrong when they see something different something their not use to but don't let it get in the way all that matters is that you like her and she likes you. Remember it doesn't matter what people think|`|CTN8bnVgaa	You must be from California or something.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Next you people will start dating Martians.
lNlL0Ag2aa	No girl loves two guys equally, they like each guy in a different kind of way. So choose the guy who has that side that you love more than the rest, whether he's that bad boy type, or that generous guy, or that guy who'll always have your back.<br>  <br>  I personally say that if you like all these guys, then approach the one you like most and if he doesn't want to date, then you can ask the rest. There is bound to be a chance that some of those 4 is really into you from a distance.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	seems like she's been upfront with you about her feelings...<br>  <br>  if you can't accept that...move on...
Z5U5uYv0aa	It sounds to me that you have put too much time and effort into this. It stinks, but sometimes no matter what we do, the object of our affection will just not see us as we want them too. <br>  <br>  We can’t make someone love us, we can’t make someone lust for us, hell sometimes we can’t even make someone like us. It’s just the way it works. Love is a  tricky thing that way. The chemistry is there or it is not. It may be there for you, but it is obviously not there for her. So, and I hate to say this, get over it and get over her. Look for someone new with whom you will share chemistry. Someone who will appreciate you. I wish you much luck.|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	I don't think it's going to happen. Sorry sir =(|`|1CbL0kFuaa	move on sorry mate|`|508607ab41c5f2849e90ee5b3de45dd6aa	Do u really love her. u were annoyed by the fact that she shunned u twice. it ws teh smart of that rejection that made u win her rather than ur love.atleast thats what i can read from ur question. but its surprising why she shouldnt answer u directly. rather than letting her freidn tell u that her answer is no. i think she really is not interested in u.or may be she really wants to stay as ur best friend.still u feel so strong abt the matter, u should talk to her. explain ur real feelings to her. tell her that its important for u to hear from her mouth,whatever the answer be. if her answer is no, u need to accept that . plz dont think of hatching more plans to get her,come what may. u started it more than two years ago. thats a lot of time wasted on thsi issue.learn to turn ur attention to worthier directions. surely u kw beter than all the guys and gals giving u advice on yahoo,right. so go ahead and do it.all the best to u.
BaguqDHiaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Why not text him again saying " Hey, haven't heard from you lately... what you up to today?"<br>  <br>  Or approach him when you see him and say hi and ask him what he is doing on the weekend and if you guys can hang out.?<br>  <br>  No harm and asking... he may have no credit on his phone??<br>  <br>  Just my oponion :P
Qv1zeDFvaa	Next time you go, slip him a piece of paper with a message saying "i think your really cute!....call me xxx-xxx-xxxx :)"<br>  if he calls great, if not......Find another supermarket lol|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	ASK HIM OUT! That sounds do adorable ask him out or I will hunt him down and do it for you!|`|YmwzubmFaa	Solid Effort<br>  Ask Him Out!!!|`|bMLdEkncaa	get in his check out lane again and make up a creative way to ask him out while he rings u up....when he asks u for ur card or money, hand him a note or something similar to a credit card that says this "would u like to go out sometime?"....im sure he'll be flattered and say yes....after uve gotten to know each other, maybe u could ask him to the prom or better yet maybe he will since uve gotten to know each other so well|`|QlzOYxVjaa	sounds like he is interested in you too, well asking is the problem then just write him a note about what you feel and tell him to give some hint so that you will know that he is also interested in you.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|S0MOQGJJaa	AWWW! thats so adorable!! congratulations... thats where i met my boyfriend... well not at the same place but i met him at the grocery store... lol what better place than to meet an amazing guy at a super market haha|`|LTAI1bPxaa	if he's 21+ then dont do it!!
GPznIhzMaa	Yes, that is weird. If you want to talk to her outside of school, call her.
Bv0v2nV0aa	An uber retarded waste of time, that lacks any legal merit.|`|dZ515ZHqaa	online marriage? or people who are married but live really far away from each other and only use computers or mobiles to speak to each other|`|csBvaXjiaa	A fake marriage that people do with each other online.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	Losers that only have sex with their hands find this appealing since it' too appalling to find a real person.|`|YyP5tarFaa	A very scary and dangerous thing to get involved with.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	sounds like a game
FZKFLTyLaa	He sounds irresponsible, quite possibly attributable to how much he had to drink.
AA11124953	a) hes a good friend, being protective.. maybe over protective<br>  b) he doesnt like ur bf<br>  c) he likes u|`|nFcFcPtYaa	Maybe talking to me would solve the problem.<br>  Check out my question if you want to know why I was acting like this.|`|FqvtZId2aa	its because this Taylor wants to be with you and doesn't think your boyfriend is worthy.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	I think Taylor likes you but is just stuck in the "friend zone" cause he never had the balls to step up to the plate.This makes him hate your boyfriend cause he's hitting it out the park!|`|C3cH7RALaa	first try to understand with whom u did sex he is not a friend anymore<br>  he feels he is sole owner of ur body. so he ll do what he likes to fight 4 u with others or whatever he can go to anything.<br>  now the best friend of u alwasy saying love words becaz u r sweet cute n he is showing his emotions...he was giving u respect........but when he read ur lines abt ur bfso  he is demanding it too......<br>  its natural human being may be he just want sex from u or may be wana ur best friend as ur best lover <br>  so fight between two is natural<br>  now u choose best boyfriend as sex partner<br>  or may be best friend as best lover<br>  oooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br>  ur best friend is just trying to cash oppertunity becaz u have bf n doing sex so u r enough inteligent..........<br>  becaz ur bf is fighting to save his sexual relations<br>  ur friend is fighting to earn his sexual relations.<br>  now decide who is best n u wnat a lover true lover <br>  do ur best get ur best<br>  good luck
22bkUtWNaa	I think peoples' attributes/skills/qualities are more complex than something you can "have" or "not have". It's not like people either are or aren't something, or do or don't something. There's a whole range. Like for example, my husband doesn't like to cook as much as me, but he can - although I am much better. He is also much, much, much better at fixing the computers than me, but I'm not computer illiterate.<br>  <br>  I don't think a lasting relationship is like bartering for something that you don't have. I think it's more about trying to contribute as much as you can. I've heard it said that giving 50% is not enough; that each spouse should give 80% to the relationship - weird, because it ends up being 160%, but it makes sense to me because relationships are really hard and take a lot of work. <br>  <br>  I think that lasting relationships are built on a foundation of trust, friendship, and respect. To have a relationship with someone, you need to be able to DO things together - whatever it is. I also agree with you; you have to have some differences. Many of my husbands strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa, and probably part of me was attracted to him because of this.|`|QBWiPLVnaa	Healthy relationships work out because both partners are dedicated to each other - completely. Flaws in my mind, wouldn't be a problem. But, yes like you said, if ' Man A ' is a bad organizer and an excellent cook then that'll make him and ' Women B ' click.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	When you are thinking about marriage you want someone that is compatible with you and that compliments you like your illustration and love does help a great deal because love like a flame gets hot in some cases and less hot in other times...you have to stick with them when those less hot times are there...|`|C3cH7RALaa	i believe n have faith in my own experince n knowledge, that Transparency is the first step to keep any realtion Healthy from any bullshit.<br>  Respect is the 2nd step to keep realtions always alive.<br>  Caring with Brave Efforts is the third step to keep relation healty n alive with love.<br>  Forgiving is the 4th n last step to keep healthy alive n loveful relation all life.<br>  rest of all is God,s wish........we all r puppet of God....can't do anything more against his wish.........we can't change others mind m thoughts but we can change way of living....|`|Zg4Wfjnnaa	thats too convenient, and love is messy.<br>  i think its a positive factor, no doubt. but not necessary.<br>  and if it were the case, A should be teaching B his skills and vice versa.<br>  <br>  and no, i dont believe it works by itself, love is hard and you have to work for it. put in the effort. and also let go.<br>  <br>  my 21 year old sister just came in crying cause he boyfriend(of 2 years) and her made plans for tonight to go out for dinner, he just left saying that he had to go home to study, her argument was.. you dont make plans and just leave. and she has to work for the next 13 days, whilst i see this understandable, they spent last night together and today they went snorkelling. and she will see him tomorrow for lunch. and most likely during the week.<br>  i think she needs to let go, and find some time for herself (she doesnt have many friends at the moment in result of this relationship + other factors so instead she finds herself hanging out with me and my brothers friends - were both younger, hes 20 and im 18 ... he(her boyfriend) also doesnt have that many friends, all their free time i spent together) <br>  and i can see their relationship flaws, i think a healthy relationship isnt just giving up everything for eachother, but handling it well and still making sure theres time for you friends and family. you definately need a balance throughout the entire relationship.
yv7qSugfaa	wow. this is really confusing.<br>  could u try and explain it bettter??
mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, because he's your adopted brother...just let him down easily, and tell him it's too complicated and you want a brother/sister relationship with him and not a romantic one.|`|ZzGLotRVaa	if you like him and think it would work then go for it but if you don't want to then tell him that you think it would be to much for your mother to handle and it would be very complicated. As for the marriage thing,....well if you want you can date him seeing as there is no blood connection but tell him that you have to wait a few years for that if things work out between you two and if they don't that you have to come t terms with it because you two will have to see each other again|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Well if you like him then I don't think there is any problem with it...but you probably should tell your mom first...If you don't want to tell him the truth tell him you have always seen him as a brother and that it would be weird to say to people that you are dating your brother...or married your brother...|`|s564PQUHaa	honestly, i think this is a very, i wouldn't say dumb but... alright it's a dumb question to have been asked. you know the answer. and the fact that you had to write down, on here, says that your brain isn't quite working at optimal speed. i'll let you regain the answer that you previously had. :-)|`|NfvMIjJvaa	yes it would be wrong your mom adopted him SO he's technically your brother and not to mention it'll hurt your mom!!!|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	that's you're bro!|`|Td4ythtoaa	Well, he is not really your brother even if your mother would like him to be because she can't control your feelings for each other especially since you both were adults when she adopted him ... If you really feel in love then you can get closer by talking more and confront your mother if needed ... If feeling naughty, then don't tell her now :) ... Having him with you at home relieves you of the trouble of going out to meet a boyfriend or having to sneak him into your home ;)|`|CT64FYrvaa	try the basics, holding hands, for now. if you feel something sparky, then make sure you know wat you're doing, and if you don't, tell him.|`|bG5OYjqfaa	Not at all, wincest is perfectly naturally.|`|YG5OBZV1aa	I Don't See Anything Wrong With It. Because You're Not REALLY Brother And Sister. But It's All Up To You And What You Feel.
NQFV2AdZaa	Thanks so much for putting this information up. I live in the UK and don't use any of the expensive brands that you name. I use Rimmel, No.7, etc, i have used Elizabeth Arden in the past too. I'm surprised that the brands you mention can get away with having lead in their products, aren't there meant to be any strict regulations regarding lead in make up? I just wondered because when i was at school, we got handed leaflets regarding lead in mascara that Pakistanis and Indians etc used. I must admit i used it too as a child when trying on my mum's make up. I'm concerned if this could have caused me any harm, i truly hope not, although i stopped using the mascara once i heard!
u9GQRbhvaa	Yes, me..nearly 20 actually ...soon|`|AA12354369	wow.  I have wanted to ask that SO MUCH, but never got around to it.  You hit it on the head too, cuz I'm 19 AND I'm a virgin.  Why do so many people think that if you're a virgin at 15 you should be shot?  an exaggeration, sure, but it seems that way.  Virginity is a gift, one you should only give to the man or woman you marry.|`|nCRUnCJxaa	yep! lol|`|Y9Hm6fYWaa	I'm 20, but my sister is 23 and still a virgin. I have no clue how she's lasted this long....|`|9cBAUMnNaa	odd ? dude.<br>  <br>  I am 25 now but I was a virgin till I got married at 23|`|ptyBSoGjaa	Yerrrppp, righ here!|`|0v0YKkraaa	Yeah there are plenty. I will when I'm not 19. Abstinence For The Win!|`|Lnrmxq9Qaa	am almost 20 and virgin so don't worry dude ur not alone|`|Xj6XZR89aa	I'm a 21 year old virgin!
6o6Ao1Paaa	I'll slap him. You shouldn't do something like this. You should buy a cute teddy bear and a card and tell her that you like her.|`|5LR1RZelaa	You need to talk to her about it...not just go for a kiss.  That would be inappropriate and could be taken as sexual harassment.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think that's quite nice.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	no, that might freak her out.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	dude that is so childish, does not give any sweetness, temptation, excitement, it is completely dry way to show her that you like her. girls catches up on simple signals easily so why don't you do it in a romantic and exciting way. giving her red flowers and chocolates will already make her think that you like her. here, how about dating her in the evening. eat dinner, give her a rose, go to the park and have a talk, go to somewhere both of you can enjoy and take her home without you saying that you like her. let her just sense it and feel the romance and excitement of being with you.|`|9u9ys7g9aa	Nah man that aint gonna work.....<br>  look tell her this:<br>  1st. Grab both her hands, make eye contact and tell her you love her eyes... and that you love every detail about her and that she is perfect for you and that you would like if she could go out with you cause tell her: because your nice, your sweet, beautiful, i love your personality , i feel really comfortable talking to you, plus we spend really good times together... HOPE I HELPED...|`|ml2FDYECaa	Have your one of your friends to record it and put it up on youtube.|`|PPGAE4n3aa	creepy.|`|pbyw2EYZaa	Ask her out on a date. Bring flowers.|`|2MpIA5G5aa	well...that would definitely make me blush...lol<br>  go for it.|`|zs28jN4Eaa	hehehe awws thats cute!|`|2d551121552d809b5579c385a4e1891daa	You're already scared 2 fail so ur already failing. If u do it right u can comeback later and scoop her...|`|Ciipqlcnaa	I'll probably slap them...... sorry to say but I will if I don't like them.|`|PvHKNtUYaa	I would slap you and run away.|`|AA12317231	FTW|`|vuf8Y8I3aa	I say you should. Thats different and suprising but it sounds romantic!|`|lOXbtIVDaa	someone did that to me once...wow...go for it   lol|`|igrdohopaa	Uh I wouldn't like that|`|csBvaXjiaa	No, no, no.  That is way too personal.  She might like you for a friend but may not want you to kiss her.<br>  <br>  Take her out on a date or two and when you get to know her better and you are pretty sure she is feeling you, then go for the kiss.
Njgof6hNaa	You  could always become a part of something important, like a program or charity. It's helpful to broaden your world. It helps you forget about unimportant people. Another thing you can do is get out there and spend time with friends or make some. Get busy. Ah, and you've got to stop torturing yourself by seeing how she's moved on. The watching and feeling rotten over everything you see isn't going to make you feel better. It's time to move on.<br>  I've also noticed that it's nice to start looking at other people. Don't look with the intention of replacing your ex. Just look for the sake of looking. Flirt and date. It doesn't have to be a forever kind of thing. Dating and flirting sometimes make you feel better and reshape your confidence. The first thing I mentioned does that too. Helping others makes you feel better about yourself. And being part of something, like an afterschool type club takes so much of your time that you have no time to think about the ex.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Date others right away and time will take care of the rest.|`|dm1Iy6koaa	forget about her.
iOa7rriGaa	No it's not bad if you don't want to do it then don't no matter what people say sure many teenagers smoke and drink but not all of them. There are other ways to have fun than that and to be honest drinking isn't all that it could be fun but not so much were it's the only way to have fun. They say it because they want you to give in and try it but don't trust me i know from experience if you don't like it or want to do it it's your life and body.|`|LOtStdFraa	IT IS A VERY GOOD THING!<br>  dont listen to those stupid potheads...lol
tEy9hvebaa	it broke you out of your shell... the turning point for me was joining a carnival in the late 70s... being on the midway put me "on stage"... and I stopped stuttering, was more confident, etc... I'm guessing that after a while playing poker, bluffing, etc YOU became more confident too.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	all i can say is everything happens for a reason.. sometimes we dont find out the reasons till much later in life, even when we think we know what they are we could change our opinions as time goes on and we grow wiser..|`|dFUqPcWKaa	I guess if you're good at poker, then you get an ego, and that kind of rubs off on other aspects of your life. But be careful - you might still be bluffing and haven't figured it out yet.|`|Z9kwueR7aa	you're hella right! i have a similar story.
G9ROTb9eaa	just ask her out. i know you don't want to ruin your friendship, but you cant just wait and wait,can you?<br>  if she says yes then congragulations! but if no..( hopefully not) then you would at least know she isn't the one. its a big sea out there, there will be another fish for you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bMLdEkncaa	just slip her a note and smile|`|LF7UnoOhaa	be sure to use 30oz of crystal meth before. youll lose the jitters. the only issue with it is you will rip off your skin but hey you have to do what you have to do|`|ABIl4QhIaa	Well I'm a 14 year old male, and to be honest I was in your predicament last year.  There was this really hot chick, I had the nerve to ask her out, but her parents wouldn't let her go out with me.  So what I'm, truthfully, trying to say is that, in the end, these things never really work out.  You'll most likely get over her like I did, because judging by your statement, you only like her because of looks.  Once you go to high school, boy oh boy, there are a lot more fish in the sea...trust me.<br>  <br>  Good luck, ask her, but be aware that there is a huge chance you guys won't last for a really really long time.|`|41S75G5Eaa	aww thats sweet  ;)<br>  you should just go for it <br>  even thought you are a little young...|`|FhtlD8gNaa	Go for it.|`|FUyAN0aLaa	Be brave.you can send a note to her<br>  加油：）
2PDBxlYDaa	ooh I wouldn't tell him while he has a girlfriend but if you do tell him then tell him in person, texting just seems so impersonal and like you're a coward...<br>  <br>  just say: I don't know how you'll feel about this but I really like you, more than a friend should, I've liked you for a really long time...<br>  <br>  The reason that I wouldn't tell him while he has a gf is because he might see it as you not respecting the relationship, plus he might wonder about you and if you'd be faithful in the long-term.|`|8SRjELNBaa	you: I Like you<br>  him: my cat just barfed on the rug|`|4Ply2G78aa	Don't tell him if he has a girlfriend. You can hint it but if you're flat out and tell him he might tell his girlfriend. And in girl world that's all drama.<br>  But good luck to you and him. I dated my best friend twice. That's one thing I won't do again...|`|oyuvTImZaa	you dont. <br>  you tell them  in person.<br>  sorry hun, its more respectful that way.<br>  texting is weird, go old fashioned!<br>  plus, if he likes you back, e will totally dig your confidence!
G9ROTb9eaa	exotic looking :)|`|6pu9jNZ1aa	skank/10<br>  nice boobs though|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	ur pretty.|`|8SRjELNBaa	low self esteem hence the extensive amount of make up around the eyes.<br>  <br>  Is that a pink sock?
7fow1Wngaa	i fell in love with a boy frm high-school since my junior year.  i've been crazy for him about 3 years.. he was my whole world to me. i gave him extra credit for him without him knowing but i think he figured out it was me. then i tried to help him cheat on his spanish test for him. i was willing to buy food for him @ school... i would do anything for him.... but i forced myself to believe he wasn't the one. we came frm different worlds. he was a jock, the cool popular one and i was the shy nice smart girl in school.. i even brought him stuff for valentines for 2 yeasrs... he still means a lot me and i still would do anythhing for him i even brougt him candy for christmas.. no matter how much i tried to give up on him i dn't want to .... i keep on believing we are meant to me.. i prayed to god he finds happiness even if it isnt wit me.. but i wish it is...  you just needd to wait until the rihgt girl comes along and i need to wait who god made for me|`|0ziNSYxeaa	yes just about 1 week ago this one girl i liked was hot and smart and stuff but i had a crush on her for about 5 years and i found out that if i really do fall out of love with her like i did then she just isn't the one. =(|`|eSukrfPkaa	hells ya man there was this one chick i REALLY liked and now i dont honestly give a ****
7e4jxj3Daa	That I'd want to do her then and there!|`|8SRjELNBaa	how can i say this gently.. Very excited..|`|AA12354369	Assuming I love her and her body (which I do) and that I don't plan on having sex with her until marriage (which I don't), I would be very happy, very tortured, and I would likely be horney, seeing the only body I want sexually, displayed nearly nude in front of me.  It would be a good thing.  But honey.....before you do this, make sure you are both very clear about how far is acceptable, physically.  Alright?|`|v9Zv9aGzaa	I dunno but i would like it very much, like as much as my girlfriend would like to see me in boxers =P|`|HMzUeqTmaa	I would be happy, but confused as well|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	Sex|`|nJ9lGMmQaa	Just happened to me, incidentally. I sort of have a weird feeling (in a good way!) about it. I have known her for forever and to suddenly see her without clothes on was a huge shocker. Loved it though. It led to sexy results too. Which is always good. lol.
Njgof6hNaa	He might like you, but it seems like he's still exploring his options. He's checking out other girls. It seems like he's at that stage in life, where he's like a kid in a candy store. He want all the different kinds and flavors. That's actually ok, because he's still very young and you are too. I'd say you're probably best not paying that much importance on what he says or does, because he's still playing.|`|igrdohopaa	Sorry hes not interested|`|qwXNl0n2aa	i think he doesn't like u anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  sorry to say
uAzToWC7aa	LOVE HIM!!! UR LUCKY THAT HE LIKED YOU AND DONT U DARE DISSAPOINT HIM! U ALREADY RAN AWAY SO U MIGHT AS WELL GO OUT WITH HIM IF HE ASKED YOU OUT1!!|`|ppX0xoeFaa	He does love you. You need much time to talk with him as he is so shy.|`|dYA5DxFSaa	hey calm down spongy girl...........i suggest first go down to him make frnds wid him.try knowing him better if u stil feel he is ur guy then go on wid him if not jus turn him down.........and luk out 4 sumbdy else|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	obviously he's probably joking|`|d1mUEw9laa	i think you should break the awkwardness a bit first,<br>  other than that, go for it|`|DTN6Vg8caa	take the chance|`|Ip3KoXYfaa	Go look in the mirror, and say: I am a perfect girl! 10 times and call him.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Your just a normal who wants to charm the pants off every gil you meet.That's fine,they know to score.
a1dpU3JMaa	actually it varies from person to person , if the affair was just time pass no need to end up with marriage and if both are serious than it should end up with marriage|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Not enough information hon. More details please.|`|E0JqCDy6aa	Why you are confused and worrying?
QBWiPLVnaa	I don't see anything wrong with that,<br>  it's only a 2 year age difference.

Unless he really likes you.|`|MlkSldJ1aa	Yes they would as long as it was a boy who didn't think sexually all the time. The reason I know is because I am 16 and I am dating a 14 year old girl that will be 15 may 4th. So yeah but it depends on the boy and how he thinks. Me I am more into the love thing and the most I think  about is cuddling and holding my girlfriend why she falls asleep in my arms.|`|C3cH7RALaa	as per my knowlede n experince or our holly books or society (Hindu religion) the age difference should be 5 years in a sexual relation but now a days everything is fine.<br>  the best thing is how when where with whom to enjoy...........<br>  so cash the oppertunity whatever the age..............<br>  cover the face F**k the base....................<br>  the Mantra of new genration adopted from past getting all knowledge abt race/color of skin/religion/nature and like dislikes|`|N5q1osbCaa	It depends on the guy, me and my boyfriend started dating when he was 16 and I was 14, I'm 17 now and he's 19, it's not much difference so you never know!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|FBSOBz0zaa	probably :]|`|ItzWoQyzaa	i dont think it is a very good idea but i dont see why it cant happen|`|6pu9jNZ1aa	Being a 16 year old boy i can say no|`|PhivaI6Oaa	probably. i was 14 when i dated a 19 year old
DCzSBPUjaa	Hot = FAKE<br>  <br>  Cute = REAL<br>  <br>  When a girl is considered "hot", she looks SOOO good that she looks fake.<br>  <br>  When a girl is considered cute, they are purely hot in a "non fake" way.<br>  <br>  I prefer cute.|`|SkjujL6faa	cute, I love cute cause its true love. most the hot girls mess you around
lemQUobOaa	u ATTRACTED towards her..!!!|`|XeGvBJLjaa	playing u and u need to work on your control then|`|mCoipTkbaa	ha! horny guys these days...|`|CiYCSzufaa	wow. lol. maybe its a little bit of both possibilities...she might have likes the fact that she was turning you on...its a real ego booster..ya know (:|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	Maybe she wanted you to think she was just messing with you but you were actually validating her because she's getting older.<br>  Old people get sad when people stop thinking they're attractive.|`|JxmJg37Iaa	lol, u gotta laugh at that|`|9QKu9ynxaa	dude u need to calm down n get laid or something.
HkgTtCMyaa	AWWW thats cute if a guy told me that i would lvoe it i love friendly people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im sure she WILL SAY YES SO YA ASKK HER YOU MIGHT MAKE A REALLY GREAT FRIEND IF NOT A GF|`|FBSOBz0zaa	That would be good :]
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	that sounds perfect...good luck...|`|xutAEx7Faa	no. dont just walk up to her like "HEY, I DONT KNOW YOU, BUT LETS GET LUNCH"<br>  <br>  <br>  thats so werid. slowly start chit-chatting for a couple days in class. maybe 3-4 days so you AND her feel more comfortable. then ask her to lunch after you have established some kind of connection. feel me?! good luck.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
94dc4cd341a7f9bdd676e391f9d83036aa	Try and find a book or a movie that you both like or find an activity that you have in common.  That should give Y'all something to talk about.
8hIUOajLaa	If you feel that you have done wrong to him, then apologize.<br>  Try to at least wipe the slate clean, its fantastic that you realize what you did was wrong.<br>  If you try to apologize and he accepts then great, if he is still bitter and doesn't want to hear it, then too bad. You tried and its his issue there after.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Yes i think that you should write him a letter the worst that can happen is that he doesn't answer back not that big of a deal since it have been a while because then you get closure and not leave on bad terms with someone...|`|TnIsuYqYaa	He has moved on,and he  wont trust you now.I wouldn't give you the time of day.
AA10173229	Maybe you're just nervous about him?  I don't have a lot of experience in this field (considering I have never been in a relationship), but I think you should just follow your heart and be yourself.  If he really cares about you, then he won't force you into anything, and just kiss him when you're ready.  ^_^  Don't worry, you'll get through it!

NbmnWwqEaa	Give her a little space . . . <br>  <br>  That is a good idea. Your jealousy added to her issues. She can't please everyone and you adding more stress on it was the straw that broke her back.<br>  <br>  She's thinking clearly enough, considering what she is going through. You become an issue instead of a help with the jealousy (insecurity). She needs a soft, safe place to land. And sweety, you cannot fix everything.<br>  <br>  You men reallly think you can fix everything .. . and often, we women just want to vent, and have no answers or plans of action.<br>  <br>  Now, give her space, yes . . . tell her you are "giving her space". Do it kindly, with no anger or malice. Simply say, "I will give you space, of course. Sorry, I didn't listen the first time (insecurity). Can I call you, and check on you, though, in a week? I hear you and know you are stressed . . . still, I want to continue to be here for you."  And remind her, "And anytime of day or night, if you need to just talk or cry or whatever, you can call me and I'll do what you want -- just listen or talk, if you want me to."<br>  <br>  Do this calmly, when you are both calm. And then, play it by ear.<br>  <br>  In a week, call, calmly and say . . . "Checking in, as I said. I miss you and hope you are doing better?"<br>  <br>  You may not have to wait a week . . . she will probably call you. <br>  <br>  And as another said .  . . you cannot make her happy. That is up to her. You, too, must find happiness and joy within you. Your joy should not depend on another person. Another person should "add to" your life . . . two whole people make life better.<br>  <br>  It is a sure sign of "insecurity" and also not hearing her out when you ignore and do the opposite of her request, too. She asked for space ... believe her; and do it. That is loving and respecting her.|`|10VL5ennaa	Leave her alone for a little bit! She seems to have some really stressful stuff going on and the last thing she needs is her boyfriend trying to force her to talk to her all the time. There are some things a girl needs to talk about with her sister/ best friend and not her boyfriend, especially about an ex. It sounds like you are pushing her away by doing all this and she can't really handle it right now. If you stop now, it might not be too late. But, if you keep pushing it then she might just get fed up and not want to see you again. You should just let her know you're there for here when she needs you and you love her and just leave it at that then let her come to you. It shows you respect that she needs space and time but that you still care. Girls don't like constant texting/ calling so just give it a little while and she'll talk when she's ready. She'll see how sweet it was of you to do that and miss you :)|`|AA11942196	MY opinion?<br>  Yes, you need to give her some space.  But you also need to take a look at your life and what you are doing for YOU....it sounds as though your whole world revolves around making this girl happy?  I am not trying to be critical...just helpful....YOU are not responsible for someone else's happiness and you should not have to try so hard.  What do you enjoy?  Just for you?  give her some space and go do something for yourself.  Write some goals, go take some pictures, create something....don't be a door mat....be good to YOU!<br>  If she really loves you, she will come to you....if she doesn't come to you then you need to consider letting her go.<br>  Good luck, you sound like a very nice person (too nice maybe)<br>  Dana|`|803OuDnhaa	it sounds like she's really stressed out. and honestly she told you she needed space, you should of listened. so give it some time, let her cool off but when she needs you be there for her. she may just be trying to figure out a way to make things better and just needs time alone to think. good luck. hope i helped.

AA10408380	I'd talk to an immigration lawyer. The marriage would be illegal TODAY, as the girl has to be 18, and the guy has to be 21. But when the marriage took place, the bride only had to be fifteen(to my knowledge). This was the law in india(to my knowledge). In Australia, it might've been illegal. It could just be a misunderstanding reguarding country laws. This is y a lawyer should be consulted. Good luck.

d36OrpbDaa	he's being a jerk.<br>  <br>  he knows you're unemployed, so he knows you can't afford what he's asking of you.  he also knows you're new in town.<br>  <br>  he just wants you to do all the work.  he's inconsiderate.<br>  <br>  besides, i think if you're just dating, the person who asks to go out, pays.  once you have a job and have some extra money for going out, then of course you'll contribute more.<br>  <br>  it's unrealistic - and rude - of him to expect you to spend money that you just don't have.<br>  <br>  his inconsiderate behavior probably does not stop here.  he's probably like this in other areas too - the bedroom, feelings, arguments, anything.  <br>  <br>  besides, it's pretty low-class and cheapskate-ish to complain about the bill.  it sounds like he's the one planning the dates (cuz he complains you don't).  he should either shut up and pay, or stop asking you to go out for things you can't afford!<br>  <br>  and it's completely okay for you to not plan dates that cost you money.  you're being realistic about your finances and are being responsible with your money.  that said, there are plenty of things to do that are free, or cheap that you'd do anyways  - watching a movie at home, cooking dinner together, going to free days at the museum, etc.  but i don't know if he's the kind of person to appreciate these sorts of dates or ideas - he doesn't sound very appreciative at all.<br>  <br>  i'd say find another boyfriend.  trying to fix a guy never works.  you've already talked to him about it and he still doesn't care.  there's too many guys out there without this problem, to justify putting up with one like yours.|`|C3cH7RALaa	kick him away from ur life as soon as u can <br>  n save every penny for ur bad days<br>  n find a guy who cares u not bills.<br>  good luck<br>  its the time of worldwide financial n job crises so concentrate urself in job only till u feel strong enough|`|x8rYunYeaa	hes pretty much a jerk|`|AA11263103	Dump him NOW!|`|Kl4kv5khaa	So he is upset that after keeping score instead of enjoying the time he gets to spend with you, you have decided not to start looking at other options?

5wvg0sLLaa	just ask him if he has feelings for you still.<br>  However, usually when a guy says hes not ready for a relationship it means hes not into you. My advice for you is if you want to know ask him, in person, and he will answer what you want to know, but if he doesnt like you, you will be okay. just take your experience as a lesson and the next guy that comes around dont be so mean to him and take him for granted.

BvFtIJzsaa	Wait a few days and then text or call her with a joke.  If you try to make her laugh, that might help to break the ice and lead to a longer conversation.  Once you find out what her interests are, you can build on that.  Good luck!
apbuHIJOaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask.

nWhtuZFDaa	Wait for him to get back to you would be the best thing, if he's on a trip than that means he's busy. So give it sometime and don't be so insecure about it!|`|2ui3RzaHaa	First dnt txt back because he might get annoyed that you are txt him like crazy and then he will surely not be interested|`|2cBYsYj4aa	Don't send another text, just wait for him to respond. He might be busy.|`|AptDOfFPaa	Ha ha no worries maybe he just got cought up doing something! He definatly likes you!|`|0OpKpEbEaa	he told me he doesn't like you, he likes me|`|ERLmjHF3aa	im guessing he likes you, and yes send him another text right away!|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	If he texted you when he was in his trip then that means that he might not be soo intrested, if he has not since he left then you should wait intill he gets back.
FZKFLTyLaa	It sounds like you have a one-sided infatuation.<br>  Someone else needs to be the object of your affections.
imEV2iKGaa	yeah, i get what you mean, this guys really kind off irritates you right? Well, it's like obviously the both of you had break up and he purpose constantly show up in front of you. From my view, i think that he is showing up so constantly because he wants to piss you off or it's just another coincidence.|`|CwdcbFr0aa	Hey Jill. I personally think he's testing you. I think he showed up to see if you still like him and want to be friends or whatever. I think he did it on purpose but honestly I don't think he's worth your time. Any guy who says he dosen't care if he's friends with you or not isn't one who's gonna stick by you when you need him. I'd say forget him and move on. I'm sure there's plenty of guys out there who actually WANT to be your friend. I think your time is better spent on them.<br>  <br>  Hope things work out.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Don't deluade yourself.You said your were sorry and virtually said "Friends or nothing".He's trying to tell you loud and clear it's over.Listen.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	He made it pretty clear, hun. Time to move on.|`|C9Shvmp8aa	don't relive the fight, just remember what he expressed (heated or otherwise).  Know what it was that boiled over and take a minute to recognize who else is visible during the 2x schenes.  Is it more about who is with him or you?|`|QB9szNYMaa	He wanted his stuff back, stop reading into everything. It's been over a month, so he probably doesn't really care about you. If you still care about him, deny the friendship offer.|`|lPJSF3vRaa	Just be friends if you can, stop trying to read more than he wanting his papers back twice is not a lot after a month .
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	yes...give him a percent sign...|`|LHzlvfRQaa	You haven't said what it is that you are giving to your boyfriend. <br>  I'm just assuming that its that cute photo of yourself on your avatar! And yes, I think you should give the photo to your boyfriend.

How about on Saturday night?<br>  <br>  ..and the conversation goes on. <br>  <br>  If you wanna seduce him on that night the go on.|`|7p68g6xkaa	if you really wanna have sex with him then go for it and just tell him straight up.. im sure he'll do it.. just be careful and use protection!  think about it really good before you do. goooooooooood luck =]
KZ3AfoOcaa	Do guys like text at all ? we like real things! sometimes it is fun, but not that much as girls want. no need to think, if u want u do, if not, then dont..|`|TqeuXRLDaa	I really wouldn't care if i where him. But i wouldn't like to be woken up by a text message though|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	That is sweet, really. Then he will think about you until he fell into sleep.|`|M0KLWw54aa	not really|`|shpzCyU3aa	send goodnight<3 <br>  not if you dont like him though lol sorry but yeah your thought of what to send him was nice.|`|hxEylk59aa	yes|`|WRC0O6tqaa	yes u can if he reacted then tell him im texting as a goodfriend im texting my ex gf all evry night and she is texting me too|`|a87POYvAaa	yeah it would make me feel loved and cared for =). i wish my past gf's did that to me =/. they took me for granted because of my outer appearence and not my inner =(
yOLeRiTZaa	.<br>  <br>  ~_~.<br>  <br>  Shyone--<br>  <br>  For me, I tell a person exactly where they stand with me.<br>  <br>  I think that if when you confide in a person, & you have to make it clear, that it is between the 2 of you...Well, there is a lower level of closeness.<br>  <br>  If you confide in a person, and the request for keeping it between the both of you is unsaid... IS A GIVEN, then, you are comfy in the fact, that you are very close with that person. You can tell this person anything and take comfort in the fact that they know what is personal and what is public record.<br>  <br>  Great Question by-the-way !!  Star for you!!<br>  <br>  Answer ya Later!!<br>  <br>  ___________ ~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|ouEix2a2aa	When they ask you for help, when they feel they can tell you about their problems, when they want to do things with you alone, as well as in groups...|`|PYZ3APQDaa	usually if you are just a friend you are going to get minor details but with a close friend you get the juicy details for example a conversation with just a friend would go like this. " i went out on a date with a guy and i had a really good time." but with a close friend you are going to start from the beginning . like he came an picked you up, you ordered this, you held hands, you got a kiss at the end of the date, what your conversation was like, what you had on. In other words you want your close friend to know what was special to you and with just a friend you might just be making conversation to pass the time.|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	the nature and depth of your converations will usually tell, we tend to confide more as trust grows, or conversely, we use more caution in less devoted relationships
24Xy8qWtaa	Pedophile? No. Creep? Yes.<br>  The girl doesn't exactly sound like an angel either though.|`|7jkS5Cklaa	My answer is yes.|`|nC9TGrfGaa	Um wow, that's only two years difference. Big deal. He's not a pedophile - a pedophile is attracted to little kids.
AA11832714	Sure can  !!<br>   I have been married to the same Lady for 41 years this April, and I might add, that I wouldn't change it .|`|sZ2CDOdwaa	Yes but as you know there are a lot of temptations so that girl better be bloody special|`|lTsONvwQaa	one hell i could stay with 5 lol jk yes of course we can some guys cheat others dont. I dont|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	Well I've been doing it for 21 yrs now.|`|b913c8b7c941189d314d33ad1ef6a6efaa	yes, especially the old school people, my folks were married for 54 years, dad just died. <br>  They were never with anyone else, and they were happy most of the time. I don't remember a time when they ever fought about infidelity. Moms says she has no regrets either, but she is looking forward to finding someone to spend the rest of her life with.. hope she does.<br>  As for today just starting out, I don't think that it is always the best way, we now have learned that everything is disposal, and think that too many people like myself don't think that we should have to, I'm in and alway have been in open relationships, and marriages, much more enjoyable, fun, exciting, and you never have to lie to each other about anything if you can be honest about your love life, and have all the strange you desire...and then some, when we first started meeting with other couples, we found that our sex life got so much better, and more often, and we swapped a lot less than I thought that we would, only a couple times a year it turns out, and that is what kept us happy. Still are, and still swinging...any other couples want to hook up let us know... Wizzard4angel.. at  yahoo..|`|C3cH7RALaa	yes go n look in India<br>  how it works can't tell in few words.<br>  but indian guys n gals almost 90% r 2gether they live.|`|C9Shvmp8aa	i thought i could but didn't.  love is mobile, and both parties have to give effort to keep up.|`|gpCjrJFcaa	Yes if they are decent ones and are not of the play boy type PLUS if they love just that girl truly|`|F6SilA1Faa	if they truly love them, totally<br>  <br>  if they're just settling - lol...|`|51441Us8aa	I know I can. But it depends, she's got to be the right girl.|`|imEV2iKGaa	Well, that's a tough one. For a relationship to work, both parties must give in to each other and well, most importantly respect each other. But, most of the time, guys can't resist the temptation of, well i think you know what i mean. Once the girl gets older, the guys would start to find her a nuisance, well im not saying all but most of the guys. So the percentage of guys staying with girls for rest of life is like 20% of chance judging by high divorce rate now.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	They can if the person involved has a nice character.
z2cysiEhaa	Goodness girl aren't you exhausted trying to keep it going with this loser who obviously isn't interested in you? Find a real man.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	hook up with me and piss that loser off....
tK7XacH7aa	Well, what's happened so far that it seems to be a problem with the relationship? Do the girl's parents want them to be together? The guy should also realize that some people have to go for advice from someone and parents have actually been through life and know who and what to look out for in case a guy will just use the girl or whatever some guys will do to girls. It's good that she consults them in some ways. <br>  Just to clarify, did the guy already say it to the girl and then she cried? If so then he has to apologize if he really wants the girl. If he hasn't then there's nothing you can do to settle this "problem" because it's not really a problem and she's just going to someone to advice, after all parents do know best. Otherwise he should just work with this if he really likes the girl. <br>  To be of more help I need specific situations and be able to know both sides of the situation.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	THIS GIRL AND  HER PARENTS IS A GIFT FOR ANY MAN<br>  <br>  THINK ABOUT IT
TImzyFnYaa	just because someone doesnt APPRECIATES having children doesnt mean they are a bad person. some people just dont want kids and people need to accept that. <br>  <br>  u are both so young. u both need to take ur time and let ur relationship grow and get married later. ur only 22 and he's only 24.  u dont need to be married so young like the other posters have said. there is no hurry. speaking from experience, u both need to wait till ur graduated from graduated from college before u get married.  if ur going to have kids u need to have at least 3 yrs from the time u get married to experience being a newlywed couple and wait till u have established careers before u two have kids.  a couple of these posters can say aw kids are great and kids are wonderful but they cost money. and in this troubling economy u want to make sure u have a secure job before u have kids because its easy for us here to say go have kids, but they arent going to be there helping u take care of them.  i'm not saying dont have them but u need to be absolutely 100 percent sure.  also ur bf said he doesnt want kids.  ur fiancee is being mature to admit this now before marriage.  lets face it people can have very fullfillling lives w/out kids.  he's not being selfish, for not wanting any either. its his life and his choice and he has a right to live his life the WAY he wants.  now u have to decide whether or not he will change or he may never change.  i think if a person says they dont want kids they dont want kids and that doesnt make them the bad guy at all. they just dont like kids.  i think becuase of that major sticking point u may have to move on.  u have stated u want kids and u cant compormise on that.<br>  <br>  one particular poster seems like she doesnt live int he real world. at 24 ur just out of college wantitng to see what there is out to explore int he world. u just finished hitting the books for 4 yrs and now u want to relax and start to hit the ground running on figuring out ur life.  in fact this man is very mature for not having kids he doesnt want.  so he's not a boy just a normal young man.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Wow, he's been with you for three years but he still doesn't know if he thinks he wants to marry you?  How many years does he have to be with a woman to know that it's right?  Sounds to me like he isn't really interested in marriage.....only shacking up.<br>  <br>  And he's WAY too into a woman's looks instead of the person that she is if he's so worried that a little baby weight is going to change his feelings about her.  I doubt he'll ever want kids if that's the way he feels.<br>  <br>  I think if you're looking for the dream of marriage and kids that you're with the wrong man.  Doubt you'll ever get this from him to be completely honest with you.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	If you were "in a loving, committed relationship," there would be a ring on your finger by now, and he would be calling you "wife." No ring, no marriage = no commitment.<br>  <br>  This man is doing everything but turning himself inside and out to show you that he's not interested in getting married anytime soon (or ever), or in having kids anytime soon (or ever).<br>  <br>  Why are you so willing to wait, when you're ready and he isn't ? Why would you compromise yourself like that, especially when you also said that you don't want to end up spending more and more years with him, and especially with someone so shallow? What are you going to do if you have 3 kids within 4 years like my sister did? Losing your pregnancy weight is NOT gonnabe the priority with children under foot, ok? The LAST thing you need at that time is a man who can't handle a few extra pounds - especially when it's not like you just let yourself go! What a jerk to say that !! After hearing him say that, are you telling me that this ... boy ... is still attractive to you? pffft <br>  <br>  Why not just have a conversation with him? tell him, "Sweetheart, if you're positive that you don't ever want me to have your child, and if you're also positive that you don't ever want a marriage, I think we need to decide whether or not we are a true match. As much as I care for you, this isn't the future that I want. I DO want my own children, and DO want a marriage. I don't want to drag you kicking and screaming into marrying me, and having children of my own when my belly gets big and you think you'll be disgusted, ok? WHO ARE YOU !?!?"  (Ok, just kidding about the "who are you" in caps, but the rest needs to be said). <br>  <br>  If he "already knows that he wants to spend the rest of his life with ... " you (your words), then CALL HIM ON IT.<br>  <br>  Raise the bar!<br>  <br>  Have that conversation and see what happens. If you can't have that kind of a dialogue with your "loving, committed" boyfriend, then he's not the one for you, anyway, so you might as well find out now whether he steps up to the plate and does whatever it takes to KEEP YOU, or whether he lets you go.<br>  <br>  Frankly, it would have been over for me once he made the remark that he's worried about finding you attractive after you have babies. That's the kind of remark I would expect of a teenager - not of a grown up 24 year old man. He's not the one for you.<br>  <br>  He's not ready, and it doesn't look like he gives a rats behind about it. If he cared about you, he'd cut you loose so that you could find a better man instead of wasting any more time on him.<br>  <br>  Were I you, sex would be off the menu until this is figured out. Please tell me that you're not living with this ... boy. <br>  <br>  This is my view.|`|32QCv0l1aa	Well it's better that he's telling you beforehand of everything that he doesn't want kids, so that way he's giving you time to think things ahead for yourself. I think that if he's told you that, there will definitely be some problems if you get married and still want kids of your own. And things will most like go like this:<br>  <br>  He'll decide to say ok let's have kids, and then problems continue because he didn't want kids in the first place... Then you get divroced and the kids are left without their other parent (most likely their dad). And I'm sure that you don't want (or definitely shouldn't want) things to end that way for your kids and you.<br>  <br>  So I would say that in the end, it might not work out for the better, and if you care about the children you want to have, I wouldn't stay with him. I would wait to find a man who's able to truly APPRECIATE what having children and raising them into the best adults they can be really means.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you'll know what the right thing to do will end up being.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If he doesn't want kids, don't ever expect him to change. I know too many women who married guys like that, thinking they would change their mind after a few years. They don't. A friend's husband of 7 years just left her when he found out she was pregnant and she's now 8 months along and on her own as he's moved across the country. Another's husband had an affair on her when she was pregnant and spends as little time as possible at home because he keeps saying he didn't want kids so she can't expect him to devote all his time to them (None of us understand why she doesn't just leave this guy)
g2ghIJ0Aaa	I've actually been cheated on twice.  The first time, I broke up with her and ended back up with her after three months... only to be cheated on again XD   The second girlfriend cheated on me while I was away for three months, so I knew what to do there, just cut communication.|`|SIRmkzEBaa	If someone has cheated on me, that means that they weren't faithful to me, and loved me as much as they say they did. Meaning, OF COURSE I'd dump the person, even thought it would be hard for me, it would be the best thing.|`|VnK2sqcjaa	I would never talk to them again.  No hitting, screaming, fighting, or even talking at all involved.  I would just get out.  Once a cheater always a cheater and the trust is gone.|`|JV0i77uiaa	I would dropped like a hot potatoes.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Been there, dumped her of course.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Leave them.<br>  I know a lot of people say OMG I WOULD LEAVE THEM AND PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE DON'T MESS WITH ME but I honestly would leave them.. minus the violence.
HI9jZSObaa	Honey just let him go. He doesn't deserve you especially he doesn't deserve you waiting faithfully for him. He's just keeping yu on the side in case he can't find anyone else. He's apparently moved on and doesn't know how to tell you that he's seeing someone else, or he's too much of a coward. No man is worth waiting for if they're not willing to wait for you. Aske for your stuff and leave it with dignity. He's not worth and your def better than he is. You can find someone better that will appreciate you for you. And appreciate what he has when he has you. Your ex will regret it.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Hey, if you two weren't together back then, you can't yell at him. But finances right now ARE stressful for everyone, and that's probably why he's distant.|`|AxmjNRVaaa	Here's the deal. Your ex is totally keeping the back door open with you just in case he doesn't find someone better. I just discussed your issue with my guy and we both agree. Your ex is just manipulating you into waiting in case he ends up lonely. He doesn't want to be with you but heaven forbid you go be happy with someone else. Men are like dogs or babies with toys, they don't want to play with them but they don't want anyone else to play with them either. It's ludicrous. I am not going to say "get over it" or "he's not worth it" or "don't be hurt". That's easier said than done. You have every right to be hurt, disappointed, angry, embarrassed (let's get real, our ego's get bruised big time) and any other emotion you may have. However, he's already made a fool of you so confrontation just gives him the upper hand again. I would definitely get someone to get my stuff back and IGNORE him. It will be hard but again, men, like dogs, hate to be ignored or feel unimportant. Bad attention is better than no attention in their books. Being ignored and being treated like you don't matter sucks! Think about it. Would your ego feel better if your ex ranted and raved about how you hurt him or if he acted like you were nothing and just moved on? Exactly. Talk about it your feelings online, with your friends, in your journal, exercise, party, whatever you need to until you feel better. Just don't let him see you sweat cause it's over with him and you will never have a secure, mature, trusting relationship with him, ever. You know that already. Don't be a fool. MOVE FORWARD and learn from this. You are not frickin call waiting, you are a person!

HQ8xCEdZaa	Well let's see, the difference for me is that:<br>  <br>  BEING IN LOVE- After you know the person's nasty habits..rituals before he sleep, in short knowing him beyond the physical aspects and still accepting that person as who he/she really is with no questions asked.being happy wherever and whoever he'she is with, as long that he is happy too(although it hurts) <br>  <br>  UNHEALTHY OBSESSION - Hmmm, for me, this is mostly about the physical aspect and this is the "selfish" kind of love..where thinking that the person must solely belong to you and no one else (ex. his family)and almost forcing the person to reciprocate your love|`|uGQMCDUuaa	Being in love is very different from having an obsession. Having an obsession is like being infatuated, you think you love them, but really you don't, your just so obsessed with the fact that you think you love them, but really you don't. If your in love, you will know, you don't talk about them 24/7 to your friends, you keep your love life private, because you will know its special. Here is how you know, if you fall in love with in two days, that is definitely an obsession/infatuation, but if you fall in love with them over a long period of time you will know.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Sounds silly, but I don't know if you can until its over and you then realize!

That's the difference.|`|rk88caKaaa	I'm not totally convinced there is a difference...|`|dPgc8p9saa	Sometimes it can be a mixture of the two and you wouldnt be able to tell but unhealthy obsessions usually starts out as you being in love with that person but when that said person become unattainable it can turn into an obsession depending on how close you were to the person and how much you loved them. But it becomes unhealthy when you start invading the persons space and interfering with their everyday life and sometimes it just unhealthy for u as whole cuz depending on the situation it can cause depression in the worst way! But I think your in love dear, and its perfectly fine!! i was in the same situation but my friend turned out to be gay but also in love with me!! it was a sticky situation and we are still tryna wheedle our way out of it!! just follow ur heart and i think you shud tell him how u feel its about that time :-)|`|WEM5n41Oaa	In my opinion it's not all black and white.  You can have an obsession with someone and love them at the same time.  But, to answer your question, you will know if you truly love someone because the feeling will last.  Obsessions usually fade away pretty quickly.
71VRvldJaa	Less than 5% develop into a permanent relationship and 50% of the 5% that do end up splitting up. Some can last for several years but usually it's considered a long term affair if it lasts 2-5 years.

1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	Let me assure you that YA or statistics by no means represents what will happen to you.<br>  <br>  I have been with my husband for 18 years and I'm 34 years old. We have two children and we are generally very happy (we are going through a cycle /stage now - and you know what - most people pick up and leave during a stage instead of sticking it out). I'm not talking about the unfortunate people in abusive relationships...I'm talking about people that suddenly find someone else so attractive and the partner less attractive, they dont realise that instant gratification is great short term but long term happiness requires long term strategies. <br>  <br>  You will notice that statistics show certain people seperating. If you AND your partner believe in your marriage vows then you are in the category of least divorces.<br>  <br>  Good news you are past the 7 year itch...it gets even better from here on.|`|ULUpOqplaa	For 10,000 years of modern history and 200,000 years of ancient history polygamy was a way of life in all cultures and societies.  About 1000 years ago the church made it a sin punishable by being boiled in oil.  About that time they licensed all of the brothels to the church.  The 2 purposes of those moves was to make a ton of money on the brothels and to control people.  Marriage has never been the same since.  The divorce rate is 50% nationally in the US except 60% or better in the bible belt and in So Cal.  Swingers have a divorce rate of under 5%.  There is a reason for that.  Divorce 1000 years ago was probably about 5% also.|`|lckv4hs3aa	You know the actual statistic is 2% of marriages end in divorce each year. I think having high expectations is a killer, people often believe they'll be more secure when they get married or things will just be better... no it will be the same.

You are not called to change together but to contend with each other through your changes. To accept each other no matter what comes along. <br>  Lies? Will you forgive? <br>  Cheating? Will you forgive? <br>  Cancer, Parkinson's, accidents.......will you continue to accept and forgive? <br>  <br>  (you'll notice I said nothing of love?

W1MRXpc8aa	Both were pretty hard for me. But I think days were harder. <br>  At night though I would always dream about him. (I still do even though it's been months and I'm not "heartbroken" anymore) They weren't bad dreams, they were great dreams. And that was even worse. I would have dreams that we were still happily going out and he'd say the sweetest things to me. Then I'd wake up extremely happy and then I felt a horrible pang when reality hit, none of it is real. It's never going to happen again.<br>  <br>  The days were worse though. Everywhere I'd go and see and hear (especially songs! (obviously)) it'd somehow relate to him. His name is sort of common so I'd wince whenever I'd hear it anywhere. His last name is the same as a very talked about football player so every time someone at my house was watching ESPN and he was mentioned I'd wince even more. <br>  I hated pretending to be happy. I hated putting on a show to show not only him but everyone else that I was okay. That it didn't affect me much. Or at all. I would also hate how the days flew by and every morning the first thing that popped into my head (if i didnt have a dream. or if i did, after being mad :P) was that it was just another day without him. I would hate hearing him laugh and hearing his voice even when he was simply answering an answer in math class.<br>  <br>  Having a broken heart is terrible either way! :(|`|10VL5ennaa	For me when my bf and I had broken up once, it was worse at night when I'd be at home alone all I had to think about was how sad I was.

d36OrpbDaa	i think you should go.<br>  <br>  you need to know him for who is truly is, and not just see him how you WANT to see him.<br>  <br>  of course he'll act different when he's fighting.  he's in the zone.  he's not an animal or a maniac or a murderer.  he's kickboxing.  <br>  <br>  i know how you feel, because my boyfriend does jiu jitsu and i was scared to watch him the first time.  but i learned a lot about him and his passion.  it's scary to watch - but i was more worried about him getting hurt than anything else.<br>  <br>  i'm sure your boyfriend can hold his own and is a good person.  try to get over your fear and support him, at least this once.  don't discount it just because it makes you uncomfortable.  it is a chance to grow.<br>  <br>  in regards to the person who said he's not respecting your feelings, i think it goes both ways.  he doesn't understand why you don't want to be there for him.<br>  <br>  when his friends say "he is completely different when he is fighting," it doesn't mean he becomes a different person.  he is still the man you love.  he's just in a very different state of being.  it's not like he's lost his values and he's changed who he is.  it's just a fighting mentality.<br>  <br>  i've been in your position.  trust me, it is not as bad as you think it is.|`|ziUVXPbaaa	Every once in a while we all do something we don't really want to do. I think you could atleast go once, it wouldn't hurt, atleast you tried and you were there to support him as your gf. It's awesum that he is inviting you to watch him play sport, he is sharing his interests with you, guys love doing that and when they do, its best to respond encouragingly.<br>  <br>  If your really skeptical about going then you don't have to, but why not give it a shot? You never know, until you do.|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Everyone acts different with their passion.  If you're going to be with him you not only need to support him, you need to accept all of his sides.  No one is purely sweet and nice.  You need to accept this part of him because it's HIM.  Love him and support him.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	If you don't care for it, and don't want to experience then don't go.

He's discounting your feelings, here. That's not good. It shows he is being immature, thinking only of himself, and conceited. It could also be a power thing with him.<br>  <br>  No one should force another to do/see something they truly do not wish to.  (Your boyfriend sounds like he is in need of  psychotheraphy and sensitivity training).<br>  <br>  It's like demanding someone eat something they don't like; or forcing you to watch horror films when you hate them; or pushing you to bunjee jump even when you say you're terrified & don't want to. Normal people, decent people, DO NOT FORCE OTHERS TO DO SOMETHING THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO.  It's that simple. It's called being empathic, kind, respectful and sensitive. Your boyfriend sounds like he lacks all of the above . . . that's cause for concern.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best. Remember - no one should Ever try to control another person, or force them to do/watch/experience something they do not wish to.  Stand by your decision. Don't let him push you, tease you, or force you into this. Your thoughts & feelings are NEVER to be discounted in a relationship.  You are strong - stand up to this childish demand.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Become less friendly and when he ask what's up.Just say your going through a little crisis and you need space.
st9KHhoKaa	You should never feel ashamed for wanting to wait for the right person. Alot of my friends sleep around with heaps of guys and they don't care because its viewed as "cool" and being "popular" when in fact these guys only want them for one thing and get called s l u t behind their backs. And to make it worse they don't care, because their opinion is " i don't care, and i cant help myself" . They laugh at me because i haven't had sex in over a year and id rather wait for someone special. <br>  <br>  About your personal issue, you need to RELAX. don't worry about it. Don't have sex until you are fully turned on, with alot of foreplay and really it shouldn't hurt because you will be lubricated naturally enough. <br>  <br>  Also another thing i would do would go to ur  doctor, some women encounter having thrush, medications, soaps, gels etc they use and this affects the vaginal area in some cases in terms of dryness. Diet, smoking etc can affect this also, so have a chat to your doctor. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't feel ashamed either, it sounds like you have a wonderful caring guy who is taking the time and being sensitive to your needs. <br>  <br>  Find out what turns you on, and what makes you feel comfortable. Discuss this openly with him, and im sure he will understand,  so you become turned on and that you feel comfortable and reassured. <br>  <br>  I think its wonderful that you unlike so many other people in their 20's want to wait for someone special to have sex with, so dont be ashamed for feel different. Having morals, and self respect are good and so is sex when it is shared with one person whom you love with all you heart it can be a passionate, romantic, special experience.|`|uiJTMSw2aa	I am a man.<br>  Even if she couldn't get wet and wasn't tight, I would still love her and give my heart to her. I might think that she wasnt attracted to me sexually but would soon forget it.|`|gFHzuIrUaa	Well i think your so scared that your not letting yourself get aroused. If your really attracted to this guy, then stop thinking about it, and just enjoy, and let go of your inhibitions. If your still afraid and can't get wet, then use the KY until it starts to feel good for you, then after it starts to feel good, the next time you may not need the KY. But if it really concerns you, then you should see you gynecologist.

It is a very important part of a relationshipe.Also men have a tendency to become "comfortable" or lazy. He could just not be that into you anymore but the comfortability of his life keeps him from leaving you. It has been 5 years and men do get bored. Men are very shallow. Men dont want to admit it but we are. In the  begining its great but after a while it weans. So maybe its just time to move on. But i suggest talk it out first. I think i was in the same position that your guy is in. And if its anything like that its time to go. I was with my lady for about that long or longer and then i was just so lazy and content that when i would have sex with her it was just to get off for me or i would just do it to shut her up.

BmHzkztYaa	every human being like animals has a  sexual by instinct he don't have to ask how to kiss,how to pull and push, in general how to have and handle sexual moments ,if you are empty of this then consult psychiatrist/doctor or hire a sexually hot lady to ignite you IF you can't do this join  some shrine/monastery and live like a living being  which has no life|`|a87POYvAaa	not much girls like french kissing nowadays bro...stick with the lip locking =)|`|jF94WiDnaa	Search Kissing styles on the computer. These styles would help you to make better selection. I suggest you try all styles one by one. Perhaps the style with tongue sucking kiss is the best. It is so hot that sometimes you may ejaculate while you are busy in tongue sucking especially when you are beginner.|`|gADByUL8aa	I strongly suggest you talk with her about it. Usually, the best way to learn about intimacy is through communication with the actual person. For example, I'm a girl and I might like to be kissed differently than she might. You see?<br>  <br>  However, I can still tell you what I like and maybe you can talk about it with her? I've been dating my boyfriend since 8th grade and we just graduated high school last year. I remember the first time we made out, it was this amazing experience. The important thing is that you want to keep it that way, you don't want it to turn into a chore. That's why I suggest open communication, there's nothing to feel shy about talking. You both should know what pleases each other. Discover each other's bodies, you'd be surprised what turns each other on. Some people like being kissed behind the knee. It's crazy!<br>  <br>  For me though, there are several things that I like. As far as the bodies go, I like it when our bodies are very close. As corny as it sounds, it feels very passionate. Secondly, if you guys are taking it slow and just started dating, caress her face and run your fingers through her hair. For me, it feels amazing. If you both are comfortable taking it a little further, slowly running your hands over her breasts and along her outter/inner thighs is another option. (Haha, *only* if you both are ready and comfortable!)<br>  <br>  Then there's the mouth. If you guys have that down, that's great. I guess I can also mention that I've liked kissing slowly and softy.<br>  <br>  PS: I just discovered that I love my boyfriend kissing/licking my neck. It's.... amazing, I can't explain it. I even told him and he does it every single time before we have sex. Seriously, talking's the best.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|g2ghIJ0Aaa	Start out conservative, and go as far as she does with it..|`|shpzCyU3aa	are you like 10 years old or something|`|S262cpAXaa	Look on YouTube|`|82SvvWixaa	r u stupid go up to her and say babe i love u look in her eys then kiss her normaly then kiss her with ur toing

Most women loved to be teased... not all mind you, but most... Play with her, joke with her. Kiss her slowly on her neck and work your way around. Give her a little and keep her begging for more.

If she has some kind of fetish, that would greatly help you out. From the kissing go on to touching. Her breasts are a great place to start, not too forward, as long as shes into it. Then slowly up the inside of her leg, until you can move up to something better. Good luck.|`|EdQfe0k3aa	first of all you really need to make a girl feel like she is so special..<br>  look into her eyes, when you sitting next to her rub her leg, .... smile ..

ZypssLXgaa	Nah, not really. It's not like you were saying anything bad about her. You were just asking them for help on how to solve the problems you and your girlfriend had been having, right? I don't think it's unacceptable and I don't think she should have gotten mad over something like that..|`|fNbCeyF6aa	In her eyes it surely is.  Why would you talk to her two closest friends?  Don't you think that they would say something to her?  She now feels that you have shared your dirty laundry with everyone.  I talk about my problems with people but usually it is with my friends not hers.
HvX6KvK1aa	they do not. children mean the world to their parents. parents cannot bear it if something happens to them.
m0eVDBXAaa	my cousin has a similar situation in that her parents didnt like the guy she is seeing. they havent had the perfect relationship either but she tells me that they are so in love & are meant to be. so they have been working on the relationship with her parents & they are starting to come around to him. maybe when he comes back you need him to spend time with your mom & show her that he is really a good guy & maybe she will start to like him. <br>  you may not be able to answer it but which relationship means more...<br>  good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I think you should wait for him to come back in 2 yrs and see how the two of you feel about each other then.  Getting married is too important of a decision to make under any sort of pressure.  You are young & could live to be 80; that's 62 more years.  When you think about it that way 2 yrs isn't a very long time.  <br>  <br>  I met the guy I married when I was 19 and we were living in Arlington, Va.  We dated for over a year when he moved to Calif.  He called me & asked me to marry him.  I gave up a job & city I loved for a marriage that didn't last two years!  If he hadn't asked me to marry him I'm willing to bet that I would have started dating other guys and would have been much happier.  I thought I loved him.  Please don't make the same mistake I did.|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	To be honest mothers know best, if she does not like him because of his color then that is her problem and you should not listen to her. Other then that you are very young and if you feel that he is the one then you should marry him but to be honest i think you should live with him first to see how things are going to be. Once you live with somebody is a whole diffrent thing in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ezzSeBnLaa	1 and 1/2 years isn't really that long and it seems kinda quick to be rushing into marriage. Maybe y'all should just be engaged for a few years until he comes back, and then get married. You can spend that time trying to convince you're mom that he's a good guy even if he's a different race. She might feel that you're rushing things too.|`|mKdLVdpbaa	My first reaction was GO!! but the Japanese are very resentful of the US army there (which I fully understand) so I presume you would spend a lot of time on base. <br>  your mom is a rascist, tell her if she ever says anything like that again you will disown HER and never talk to her again.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Your mummy is important in your life.

ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	It is just having a male role model in his life to help him learn how to be a good man.  It can be an uncle or some other male relation.|`|1WSFNX35aa	I read a study the other day that associates the age of a child when the father leaves to the age that child has his or her own first child. ie. If the child's father leaves the home at a very early age then it increases the chance of that child having a teenage pregnacny.<br>  I do no think that the positive male role model in a childs life has to be their biological father. eg. my nephews dad is around every couple of months and is a complete twat.. however he receives alot of special one on one time with his uncles where he is able to speak about his thoughts and feelings and receive guidance.  A man will also be able to influence how a young boy will behave towards women.<br>  As tupac shakur said, "... for a woman it ain't easy. Trying to raise a man".|`|4a1b6069c6c92876f39bb0cfb6e57343aa	A father can be the most important role model to there son because we see our fathers every day and tend to mimic what our fathers do and say thinking that if our fathers do it then it must be alright and being the man in the family normally means that the father is the most dominent person in the family . I have a father who is a great inspiration in some ways and not in others e.g he is hard working reliable funny and takes no bullshit off anyone , but he can be very controlling and manipulative and a racist bigot so there are many things we can learn from our fathers and they are both good and bad.|`|mKdLVdpbaa	I would say its very important. The statistics for kids growing up without a strong, positive male figure are not good.|`|MkrQvR7saa	I don't really have a 'Dad' as such, but you see other males.

q4XUy0Duaa	There's no reason to feel bad about anything.  It's good that she's experienced.  The first time I had sex was with a chick who had already slept with a few guys, and I learned a lot from her.  You might be feeling bad because of what many people call performance anxiety, but that's natural for your first time.  Or maybe you even look at her as a bit of a whore or something, but you shouldn't.  Who knows?  Only you know the answer to this question, but the bottom line is that you're in a good position.  Another plus is that she is sexually active, so you don't have to wait long before you hit it.  If she was a virgin, you might have to date her for a long time before anything happened.|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	Dont feel bad, if she has had sex before then she knows how is going to be since is your first.|`|c2d4ea1419665dbcd55eece87c19c360aa	dear friend<br>  <br>  simply leave her.if she can do sex otherthan u <br>  and after coming in ur arms she can do the same again

8XKmMBU7aa	OK, She was very drunk. She smokes also. She have boy friend also. Had you tried to know, why does she drink, smoke ? why does she have boy friend?<br>  Why does she leave her husband before having boy friend ?<br>  Does she have right to her children that they may try to understand her Or talk to her. I think there is not any bad mom in whole the world. If moms become bad,  the universe will end. You are also mom of Twin and tomorrow your child's will say that our mom didn't serve her mom, Why we serve our mom. Request to you please try to understand her also and say her that read this answer.<br>  I know well, first she will cry and after that she will hold you in her arms and will leave drinking, smoking and friendship for you. <br>  If she  doesn’t leave, you will say me.<br>  I will talk to her.<br>  <br>  Truth is bitter than a lie.<br>  Any one can add me in his/her contacts, So you may remained in my touch.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Sorry you can't live with your dad.

Smoking weed can lead to mental health problems such as paranoia, hence why she may have thought you and you dad 'set her up' with the note.<br>  The note could well have been from a dealer of your mum's.<br>  The fact that she left you and your twin, alone for most for most of the weekend is wrong. You're not yet full adults, and still need a parent figure around - in case of emergencies. (even if you can look after yourself.)  And also if she's been seeing her boyfriend for over 3 years and you've still not met him - is also a bit suspect.<br>  You can always call Childline - 0800 1111  for support 24/7. There's always someone on hand to listen to your problems. You may even think about calling Social services, to get support for you and your mum. If you have drug dealers hanging around your home you and your twin could be placed in a very dangerous position.

I had to cut my mother out of my life for the safety of my now 1 year old daughter. I think that a lot of therapy for you and your sibling would do you wonders. Once you get old enough and she is still sick I suggest you do the same as I did. My mother would literally snap at the drop of a dime for no reason when she was drunk as well. It is the alcohol speaking not her. She needs to lose the booze, boyfriend, weed, and any other drugs she is doing and seek some help. If she doesn't you need to be strong and cut her off. If you love yourself you will eventually have to. It is a downward spiral and she will take you with her. I know it is hard since you love her, but love only goes so far. You can forgive her and love her from afar until she gets better. You have my condolences. Have you contacted a priest or pastor and tried speaking to them?

You see very few people wait these days and it is refreshing to hear this. Of course you should wait for Mr.Right and if you do you will have joy and peace beyond what you could ever imagine. Don't ever settle for just anyone, if your mind/heart says it's not okay then trust that always. When you do meet someone that has dated other gals then you must be very careful because the element of manipulation could be there and you are the one who would pay the price for falling into this all to common trap. Give yourself a few more years, finish school and get to know who you are and what you want out of life. When you are sure and self-sufficient, then Mr. Right should only add positive to this and he should also be self-sufficient so you will know for sure he is not using you. Never, ever allow a man to come into your life that will live off your hard work. You want an equal or it won't work. Refreshing question and renews my faith in the younger generation.

There is no real "definition". The thing that defines a date the most is how it makes you feel. Its all about what your heart is telling you and what your head is telling you. If you consider it a date, its because thats what you WANT it to be. Nobody can tell you that something is what its not. Its all up to you. I don't think you have anything to prove to anyone. Remember that :)|`|4T9fZzITaa	that is my definition of a date too..<br>  but there are group dates too. <br>  why dont you invite someone whom you are actually interested in?<br>  and to not make your friend feel bad tell her to bring someone with her too. and its all up to you.. it depends on you whether or not if that is a date.. clearly you don't want to date her so make it clear you invited her as a friend. if you dont say anything at all she may take it that way.<br>  so like i said take someone else and tell her to bring someone else too [tell her date or friend doesn matter] or set her up with a friend.<br>  doesnt have to be like that.. good luck
IbhX8kHxaa	ask a friend|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I dont think a shirt and slacks looks like an "alternative" to a suit-- it just looks like the groom was too lazy to get dressed.<br>  <br>  How about a vest and coat with a cool handkerchief in the breast pocket? Or a suit with a snazzy hat? Be creative; dont be lazy and sloppy.<br>  <br>  As for your centrepieces, candles are the way to go. Creates a nice mood for your guests. You can use lots of candles in varying heights for impact.

I have seen quite a few wedding recently where the groom has worn some smart trousers and a nice long sleeve shirt open at the collar. Usually the groom opts for tans and whites. I have even seen a wedding party where the men wore flip flops!<br>  My friend's (hope she doesn't mind!) husband wore this:<br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/photo.php?pid=1317867&id=501897411" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/photo...</a><br>  another groom I know wore this:<br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?id=608924697&aid=85458#/photo.php?pid=1997787&id=608924697" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?id=608...</a><br>  <br>  As for the centrepeices, need a bit more infor for that, what is your theme, colour scheme what do you like etc?

What you went through is something that he should respect and have some sort of empathy for. Saying he wants to **** you is nothing short of disrespectful and unsympathetic. If you guys are serious you need to talk, and if he doesnt seem to give a damn about what is important then you need to lose him. He needs a reality check, or sadly maybe you do. <br>  <br>  I am a man and I have had relationships with women who have undergone rape in their past and its nothing anyone should take lightly, especially to try and forget about it for the sake of his sexual drive. This guys thinking with his genitals and honestly all men do at times, but there is a limit and this is just ludicrous. And for him to make you feel guilty about rape is just.... I would go on swearing spree riht now and even vouch to beat up your boyfriend for you for acting like a (scuse my language) ********. <br>  <br>  Grow some woman nutts and stand up for yourself, no one should ever make you feel guilt and abuse your love for their own needs... no matter how much you love them and care.|`|QBFbvO21aa	He is selfish, and will chose himself over you<br>  anyday, I know it's always hard to leave someone<br>  you care for, and we tend to stick up and make excuses for <br>  them, but you don't need someone like that.<br>  He will never want to talk about your story and the fact that he<br>  almost blames you for your rape just shows how much he sucks<br>  as a person. Dump him as soon as you can do it, there are actually <br>  guys out there that will treat you right. Just do it....dont just "live" through it, and accept it. its wrong and it will just get worse.<br>  im sorry, btw about what happened. :/|`|YOrRafZoaa	First of all, I am sorry that you had to experience such a terrible thing. I think that your boyfriend is reacting that way because he doesn't know how to respond to the issue. Men naturally feel the need to fix all of our problems. This is something that he cannot fix no matter what he does. So he is just doing whatever he can to not think about it. He should be more supportive though. Have you tried talking to him about it when you are not having sex? Also, if you are crying during sex, then maybe you still need to resolve the emotional issues you are dealing with. Which is something he cannot understand. Sex is much less emotional for men than women.<br>  I hope that you are seeking counseling for this. If not, then you really should. You are going to have this issue until you find a way to channel your emotions about this so that it doesn't come up when you are trying to be intimate. That could be detrimental to your relationship with your boyfriend. <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|aDjTKChmaa	let him f*ck you then talk to him about it hel be more calm but if not dump his ***

Because if they annoy their crushes, they are sure that they are gonna lose their crushes. So they never does this work. But depending on the situations and the type of gals they get, this happens sometimes.|`|RfihwARBaa	Well.. if they take time and go out of their way to annoy you... yes, we want you to recognize us... but it depends on the guy...

WT6ZsvmPaa	what signs/attention are you giving him?. all i can think of is maybe he puts lots of effort in to show he likes you but he does not see that you feel the same and gets frustrated and beats himself up about it, then the next day has a negative feeling towards you. and the pattern repeats. that's all i can relate to

But every body need to stop fighting cause next time you and your friends might not be so lucky next. yes they can do some you guys cause damages to some one car!|`|omalHCZ1aa	The car being on his property and the circumstances of the fight are all the evidence needed to prove that Will is liable for the damages to the car.

07xi6IOSaa	It could be what you think.....or it can be an issue of self esteem, self gratification, and genuine adoration.<br>  <br>  Meaning if he has gained weight, he may be feeling like YOU aren't as interested in him. A self esteem issue. Self gratification, he may have been "handling his own desires" and that helped him last. My guy sometimes goes at it alone because when he and I get started, he wants to last long. Lol. And lastly, he must feel more than just lust for you because when he was demonstrating affection, that is a form of intimacy. If all he wanted to do was jump your bones, then that in no way suggests that there is so much love in your relationship. It would just have meant you have a horn dog on your hands.|`|1xM9TV3Jaa	Well I'm no relationship genius, but how about YOU talk to him?<br>  <br>  Communication is needed.|`|YoK2WhHUaa	Your complaining because he is more affectionate? Sounds like he's just trying to show he really likes you, and doesn't just want sex.|`|d5fcda0b1b369414afee0511cbb3bf20aa	Sounds like he may be up to no good. If you feel like someone is cheating the probably are.

You've got what you've got...deal with it.
Se7Y94S7aa	pedo? ...
KOXcw4klaa	a lot of people don't think that their other half would cheat.of course that's why they are in total shock when they find out.the smell of a different perfume on him or in your bed would make me suspicious.its not enough proof though.so if i were you i would keep your eyes wide open.maybe even have a friend or relative to a drive by your home when your at work to see if they can spot a different car in the area or activity going on that's not normal.good luck.|`|iblT1HJpaa	If you've "had a feeling" you are 99% right! <br>  There is something telling you that it's not just right - any you're RIGHT! <br>  <br>  You don't need proof. Time to reset the fences and set the new boundaries. He will prove himself. <br>  He will say that "you're paranoid" and that's fine. Be paranoid. This is for your marriage. Put on the brakes. Put up the roadblocks and put up the truth. He will start being accountable for everything. When he proves his worth - stop it and he will know that you care. If he proves otherwise - move on that.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I think you need more proof that just "scent"....and I would back off questioning him all the time until you feel you have some solid proof... or you will start a bad riff between the two of you.|`|wUXDKIbuaa	As a woman we have a gut instinct for things like this.  Look into it.  Usually we are right...our heart is trying to tell us not to believe it but our mind is telling us otherwise.|`|MkKvGdxKaa	I came home one night from working away and found my hubbie lying in bed. i climbed in beside him and smelt perfume I didnt recognise. I hit the roof, making all sorts of accusations, and he was so upset. turns out, with a bit too much red wine he had sprayed a bit of a perfume i hadnt worn in a while on the pillow because he missed me and it reminded him of me,  lol, silly but very sweet. I checked the scent and he was telling the truth. i felt so bad for what I'd accused him of when he'd really been so sweet. Sometimes through the years I'd have smelt scents i didnt recognise which could have been anything, the communial free shower gel in the gym, using your shampoo and it smelling different on him, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom line. If he's cheating, you have some serious issues to address. If he isnt and you have this little trust in him, you have some serious issues to address. there are major problems here and you need to talk openly and honestly and get to the bottom of it. If he isnt cheating, why would he want to be with you if you think so little of him. tread carefully. You might be right, but then again you might not. in my view both are as dangerous as each other.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	This needs some checking onto. If he smells of another woman then he must have been around one. I would set up the recorder. Smelling another on my pillow would be the worst and I would have to find out. Is he going to strip clubs? I ask because I went with mine to one and he got a dance. You could smell her perfume on his shirt the rest of the night.|`|wGPE8F2Caa	I think your right,  you know what you know! Your no ones fool. <br>  com'on now its in your face honey.  Major sign......he laughed..red flag.  He will say your crazy..blah blah blah
PbFL8jh2aa	Haha, I was just wondering a few days ago if there were any decent men around, and I realised I was looking for something that didn't exist because of the ENVIRONMENT. Decent women don't always go to parties. The ones who do usually have little respect for themselves. You're looking for jewels in a trash can and you won't find them there.|`|7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	i cant speak for anyone else.but i consider myself pretty decent.i dont act like that at all.i dont even flirt.i would rather be friends and talk with a guy,than try to get him into bed.i'm not out for that one thing.i care more about getting to know someone as a person.those women who try to seduce every man they find attractive,really need some serious help.their behavior is just plain sickening.guys use them for one thing.cuz they're always willing to give it.|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	Well to be honest the girls now that are from high school they are not it seems that times have changed but you can find a nice girl trust me there is sombody for everybody.|`|cTJa8FZYaa	im decent|`|cc3de441467bd3591cbacd40337caeccaa	yeahh theyre out there... i party alot but i dont look for a gf at them cuz those girls are worthless... it seems like the good ones are pretty hard to find though.<br>  <br>  i found one a while back but my charm didnt work on her! :( thats a first...|`|fV2SYj60aa	Well no sh*t.

I've also heard that bigfoot exists.  - hate to tell ya pardner, but they start with promiscuity, and get WORSE much worse.  Once they get a handle on the power their bodies have, their greedy selfish natures come out. THEN you'll see them coniving and playing for the most profitable chump they can score.....  The fun and games for them continue when they realize that they can create a living breathing doll to play 'mommy' with. WHO the father is don't seem to matter. What's important to them is fooling the most high end atm card (aka: man) they can find into thinking it's HIS baby, and that they love him..... <br>  <br>  <br>       Sound hateful? try giving the impression that you've got money, or power, or potential. You'll never lack for female company..... untill that is they've taken everything they can from you. THEN it's bye bye.  And don't bother showing the pain they cause, cuz thats like blood to sharks. THEY LOVE IT! It's an ego thing to devistate lives. That sound out of character from what you saw? Promiscuity is selfishness, and searching for one's value. They find it when they realize what sex can buy for them. <br>  <br>       Personally? I'll never trust a woman as more than a friend. I prefer hookers because they're more respectable than women in general. There's never any pretense or fake love.
z9k2TUcbaa	The most basic answer I can give is:<br>  <br>  Girls want to cherish their body as long as they can (meaning they prefer a serious relationship before having any sex at all)<br>  <br>  Guys like sex. They get horny and they want sex, regardless of relationships (inferring that relationships don't have to be serious in order to have sex)<br>  <br>  *That's true in MOST cases, not all.<br>  <br>  *Edit: He stares because he's attracted to her body structure. I'm highly positive that when he ignores her, it's always close contact. In that case, it's because he's too shy to approach her, or too embarrassed.|`|6krRvf9qaa	you greedy men always looking for satisfaction never caring about poor women feelings.it is human nature to be selfish.it is animal instinct some how.you can't ask scorpions why do you sting ?|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Because the boy wants only to satisfy his physical desires.|`|QFf9phAmaa	because of hungry of sex|`|1a608cddd4227e0de66bcdb10cc336a0aa	i think its coz sharing one's life n sharing a bed is something very different things.<br>  if a man marries a girl, it means that he is going to share everything with that girl. so that girl should have all the good behaviors n all to understand him. but to get laid n to have sex.. thats entirely different things. you just need to be worthy partner for sex. nothing more is necessary. <br>  and generally marriage is kind of long term relationship and also need a kinda commitment. in sex it lacks both.<br>  i think this may be the reason.|`|n3Exo1raaa	Have you ever had sex?<br>  Not to be gross, but try it and then you'll understand why men want it and don't care.

z9k2TUcbaa	Nobody would know unless you ask him.<br>  <br>  (One of those weird texts you were talking about)<br>  <br>  He seems indecisive of what he wants, but regardless, you should go talk to him about it :]<br>  <br>  Good luck ^_^|`|6krRvf9qaa	the man is confused :to come back to you or forget all.i suggest you both have some time to think about this relation.
Qc5AOoVdaa	long time ago there was a girl, whom i liked a lot. she used me. then said 'no'. then used me. then said 'yes'. then used me. then said 'no'. then used me. then told to go to hell. i almost did.<br>  <br>  yet i decided to go the hard way and not to make the last step. if i did then, i would not have been happy now. if i did not like that girl then, likely i would not have been happy now. if i started drinking then, likely i would not have been happy now.<br>  <br>  so, it's your call: to do what is 'easy' or to do what is useful. smile and make the decision.<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  mickael<br>  <a href="http://sand-grain.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sand-grain.blogspot.com/</a>|`|OyBuEpOTaa	the positive side of this is that you won't be there for your whole life.<br>  if you drink it may cause you more problems and when you become sober the problems you already have will still be there. right now involve yourself in your studies. you know what to expect from the people around so be independent from them as much as possible. if you have only 2 people then two people will have to be enough.|`|tnfJ5kMkaa	..if you continue to think that you are look down upon,.. then you will be..<br>  LOOK..why get yourself upset over this issue.. you are what you are..do not be bother with what your other friends says.. for they are a selfish lot..and do not let all their statements demoralize you..just ignore them..from your 'buddhist' perception,.. take the current situation as a 'debt' you owe them in your past life.. <br>  ..as for the subject that you are not good on,.. go back to the basic and revise and understand it a step at a time.. and you will definitely be enlighten and understand your subject..<br>  ..you must continue to have a 'will' to move forward.. and remember you are not alone.. the 'angels' or 'bodhisattvas' are watching over you every step of the way..
HvX6KvK1aa	that is a complicated question. children love both parents equally.|`|h1vYbEY2aa	thats disgusting <br>  <br>  you cant choose between your mum and dad <br>  <br>  its just wrong|`|rVFgVf9faa	neither id save their credit cards lol jk|`|07IJR6Gvaa	i cant answer but for you i will save my mum .because she gave me bitrh to me so i am nothing without her|`|lyfafpQPaa	My mom..

IPS3hWweaa	Its just the nature of the beast. Girls are attracted to the bad boy type even though they will claim that they really are looking for a nice guy. Yet they look over all the nice guys and see only the jerks. The nice guys end up as friends.<br>  <br>  But later in life, women will finally figure out they've been dating the wrong type of guy and will honestly look for nice guys. Of course, if you're young and are a nice guy, you're gonna have to wait a while unless you like older women.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Because they think it more exciting, but it does not last!|`|aA3NsOkNaa	I don't know but not all girls/females are like that. <br>  Maybe you are around the wrong ones.<br>  But I do know this is true in some circumstances.  I think it is because they don't love themselves.|`|UWj7XorXaa	some girl like to be dominated <br>  and some dont and in some cases they actually start to think they desserve to be treated bad|`|9lmTVu20aa	I have no idea, but it bugs the hell out of me, too.|`|PWIcfCbxaa	dunno cos im not, i think shovanist pigs who treat girls bad are pricks|`|P4fBHZGdaa	ive heard that the one reason is that the "bad guys" more exciting cuz there always got somthing goibg on rather its bad or good. "good uys" may seem boring and girls dont realy want a guy thats super nice to them all the time and doing whatever they ask.<br>  <br>  another reason which isnt to different is that i guess some girls like the drama so they r kinda adicted to the drama but not the guy.<br>  like guys want to relax and chill and law low to "refuel". some girls thrive off that drama and that what they like. and it can turn into a bad cycle cuz when the girl breaks up with the guy she is still used to the drama and kinda gets drawn into another guy with a lot of drama too.<br>  <br>  first inpressions are also big and the "bad guy" come off with very good first impression (whether they r faking it or not cuz they probly do mean well and r good ppl at heart but with that paticular girl they arent i guess.) so the relationship sualy starts off finebut overtime the guys start to change. and a girl miht just go back to when they first met and think of them like they were then and shrug it off and still end up staying with him cuz of that.|`|pPZv2tTQaa	Often those are the ones who don't care about rejection and make moves on a girl.  They will be forward and risk failure and keep pushing even after that.  But you can only fail if you actually try.
XR3wwNFhaa	he likes you and he doesn't know how to tell your friend that he's breaking up with her...<br>  <br>  tell him that he has to have the guts to tell her and don't jeopardize your friendship with her.  <br>  <br>  it's an unwritten rule for girls - don't go out with your friend's guy, whether they had been on or just dated, or just knew that the guy likes her.|`|NddCvrTMaa	He's just not worth your time..

Sometimes you think a girl is interested but then another girl shows more interest and you feel like you're getting caught in the middle and don't know which way to go.|`|15995e06bdbb5238f93a646319767868aa	Yes you can - it's what you then do or don't do that that may cause confusion and / or hurt.<br>  I think it is unrealistic, and very naive, to believe that people only ever meet and get together when they are both single. <br>  People aren't possessions, but they do deserve a certain level of respect. <br>  My ex left me for someone else - what hurt most was not that he did it, but that he lied about it i.e. the way he did it.....even when caught out!<br>  Be honest with your current partner, but also with yourself.<br>  Besides, just because you're looking doesn't mean you're buying!|`|HkKNFiEXaa	Yes but this shows you are not in a position you should be in.<br>  If you feel like you are interested in more than one person at a time, then be on your own.|`|2GB6LyTMaa	i did and it messed everythin up|`|Zl2JBGytaa	only if u dont do anythin about it...
be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Honey,<br>            If you are really sure that you like that guy then make sure that you understand him properly in all the aspects...like his hobbies, his fav foods, passtime etc., so that you can attract him by following all his likes and dislikes..And ask him suddenly if he likes you or not...<br>  Am sure once he observes all this from you.. he will surely approach you for asking what is that you are doing and then you can let him know that you like him and love him a lot... and if he really understands you, he will inturn starts loving you...<br>  <br>  All the best honey!!!!!!!|`|dnWN6esaaa	just ask him out for gods sake|`|iNziGCQzaa	Why? Because it sounds like he likes you. What else? I'm glad your are so love struck. Love is the most amazing in this universe. But you also have to keep a clear mind and understand that everything might not turn out the way you want. Don't set your hopes up too high. Just talk to him more and see where it leads. No need to rush into anything.
hxxOIm1Maa	Yes that happens a lot. But I have learned that sometimes is that they don't want us to do the same so we can have a better life. Is just learning upon the experiences of others.|`|G4S8wlMlaa	Call them a hipocrit|`|HvX6KvK1aa	i will point that out to them

Once, I was walking home and had to pass under this huge tree. I suddenly felt a splat on my head. Without even touching it, I knew what it was. Worse part was, I could feel it sliding down my head & onto my shoulder. Daren't look, I walked past this huge house with gorgeous hunks hanging out by their cars ('cos there was a crazy party going on) & they all looked at me and started to laugh. It was so embarassing!|`|CR7arBmbaa	Oh lordy bejeebus a hot curling brush. OUCH. That's a curling iron with spikes that come out of it...and well....long straight hair with this scorching hot spike stick rolled up to my temple was a nightmare of hot burned in knots of hair and matts and stink of burning hair.

z9k2TUcbaa	If I was single...I wouldn't act any different than I had beforehand since like you stated, I don't have any interest in her, therefore I wouldn't pursue anything differently.<br>  <br>  Although it really depends on the type of guy that he is...if he's shy, then he'll probably feel a little awkward. If he's the quiet, mysterious type, you can never tell if he likes you back or doesn't at all.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't care too much since a crush is worthless because it's a one person thing, meaning it doesn't change anything.<br>  <br>  If you like the guy, just go talk to him :]|`|6JPiNGdfaa	act normal|`|a87POYvAaa	umm, i would say hi =), talk to her etc etc|`|ozEYQHyYaa	try to act normal

I use to try to cheer myself up by saying the sun will come out some day and the clouds won't always be gray. Well, now two years have passed, and I'm happy to say that things are much better and I'm glad I didn't blow those words out of the back of my head.<br>  <br>  If you are going through that, just keep on.<br>  <br>  There's a great quote to live by:<br>  <br>  "If you're going through hell, keep going"|`|7d562e4c2cec8f112f595c590a17a6b3aa	I am too busy counting my blessings to feel sad. It's all in the mind. You need to change your state of mind. Start by feeling good about yourself. Life is beautiful if you see it that way. You have a lot to live for. Why don't you start to concentrate on the positive. <br>  <br>  Write down all of the good things in your life for instance: having a place to stay; food to eat; having parents that care for you; being able to go to school. Do you know how many kids in the third world countries who have none of the above and still manage to survive. I use to be one of those kids.<br>  <br>  Be grateful and you'll be happy. Every time you feel sad, just concentrate on the good stuff and you'll soon discover a new, happy, joyful you. Try it really. It works.<br>  <br>  Once you're happy, true love will find you. Good luck!|`|H4KZJWViaa	maybe try seing someone or just talk to a friend or your parents. the onyl reason u have this problem is cause your think to much on the bad side of life. if u start thinking all the good things in life this can change jsut like it did for my sister|`|2SmIk1PQaa	I agree with Lasselle, everyone goes through it, don't worry, I feel exactly the same, just hang on in there buddy :)<br>  <br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkhqFvkYdEJm3Zfxr7vruecgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307023438AAea2id">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  thanks.x.|`|BmHzkztYaa	no never although once i not only felt but even decided to kill a man who was cause of disturbance in my life but late my mind changed by his attitude|`|e266cb126296a9ca8950a4b0afee083daa	Yeah, I've been there plenty.<br>  My advice is to RELAX! <br>  It seems the whole world is on top of you at the moment and you have nowhere to turn.<br>  <br>  I'll let you into a little secret here:<br>  Everyone feels like this at your time in life, honestly.<br>  It may seem like others at school are having the time of their life, but they're really crying themselves to sleep aswell.<br>  <br>  Honestly, you'll look back on this time in 5 years and laugh and remember that school was the best time of your life!<br>  Just keep your chin up, and let time pass.

0SRXttXoaa	Best idea would be to get to the bottom of your helplessness and see why you feel this way. Are you choosing the wrong people to be friends with? True friends are very hard to come by, you just have to find someone you are compatible with on MANY levels. Hope this helps :0)|`|ur0V98pYaa	No it's not "crap" I know how you feel, Im having the same trouble this week. Just talk to someone more often, take them out places, have a laugh.

bBXBvGnLaa	focus on the positive<br>  start with something like<br>  me and [my sister] wern't the closest... but i wish i'd got to know her a bit better..<br>  <br>  then talk about good times u had and what type of person she was ask people that she was closer to?<br>  surely u dont HAVE to make a speech if its that hard|`|iDgBIpdMaa	Talk about memories, and the relationship between you guys (If it was a good one).|`|Pe6KGULsaa	Talk about the little bit that you did know about her. how cute she was and things like that and state that everyone including you loved her very much
ETqZU5D9aa	Tell the principal or another adult and they may be more fitted to handle it.|`|jpTl3o5naa	It seems she was willing. It is more common than you think for students to think they love their teacher in a sexual way. It is usually infatuation, as some teachers are looked up to and admired.<br>  He's the teacher and she's the minor, so it is rape even if she consented. Go talk to your guidance counselor and ask to remain anonymous. Let those in charge and the adults handle this. As a former teacher who was admired, I would NEVER let that get to me and go beyond boundaries. I was the teacher and they were the students. While I cared about each of my students, it was in a healthy way and I know my boundaries. It disgusts me to see some teachers take advantage and do such things. They are in a position to mold the lives of children and teach. That is how it should be. Do the right thing here or it will happen again. This teacher doesn't deserve to have the name of teacher and what that entails.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Tell the principle.|`|d36OrpbDaa	make an anonymous call to the superintendent of your school district.<br>  <br>  don't give them your name - just in case word gets out, you don't want people knowing it was you.  you don't need your name or reputation in this mess.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	report it to the principal. it's illegal and the teacher should get arrested.|`|WchGezIAaa	Principals office nao<br>  report what you have seen|`|GLOBmh0Baa	Tell another teacher.

My boyfriend loves to do this "hillbilly" routine around me.  (*chuckle*) I just join right in with him.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	I think she's definitely wrong to do that to you. If you don't like the way someone talks, you don't talk to them.|`|RFcbLXh3aa	no I get annoyed when someone corrrect me, I like to be myself and be silly when I am at home or on my off time.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	She is likely trying to help you. How I understand it is, if she can assist you in this area (which she believes she can) she wants to and does so.<br>  <br>  Just like you men, us women cant read minds. You need to express to her that, at home, you would really like to be you and that means being less concerned with the English vocabulary and grammar. It's not the be all and end all - living life and being happy is. <br>  <br>  We all take things too far. I was once a pain also with my husband who does not understand some words that I consider quite common but then I realised life is too short to constantly try and teach someone when they dont want to be taught.<br>  <br>  You should be able to definitely let your guard down in your own home and making up words is funny - if you can, you should!<br>  <br>  Stand your ground...express very clearly to her that you dont want to be changed.|`|d36OrpbDaa	i wouldn't like it, but i do it sometimes.  it just comes out.<br>  <br>  i'm a perfectionist, and my boyfriend speaks english as his second language.  he wasn't fluent until he was a teenager.<br>  <br>  but he does ask me to correct his grammar and spelling pretty often.  at least for papers and schoolwork... but i do it unasked when we're talking :/  i know i shouldn't, i'm trying to stop myself!|`|aCMkyR3saa	that must get really annoying  its like if your cleaning and someone is going behind you re-cleaning what you've already cleaned  gosh i hate that <br>   tell her to stop that you can talk how you want **** you want to let your hair down well in your case take your hat off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KtDUx4Cuaa	Everybody has their pet peeves.

So maybe she's not meaning to be a pain in the A**, but it maybe just a thing she has.|`|lVh05HFGaa	insecurity dude, that's why she does it. id tell her to stop correcting me. if she does it again, tell her to go outside and play hide and go f**k herself. plenty of other women in the world that are not insecure.|`|wGPE8F2Caa	control|`|AA11356977	Well I dont want to sound stupid so no I dont care if I'm corrected.|`|NaKW0E5Baa	My fiance doesn't mind it when I do it to him.<br>  <br>  I'm an assistant editor however, and I spend my days looking over manuscripts looking for spelling and grammar mistakes.<br>  It's second nature for me to correct grammar.<br>  He just laughs it off, because he knows he can give me a hard time for things I can't do as well as he can. For instance, we live in the country near the farm he works at,and have our own chickens outside. You should see it when I try and catch one. Bloody hilarious.<br>  <br>  I'll use bad grammar myself, too, which he teases me about as well.<br>  <br>  As long as we can tease each other, it's all good.<br>  <br>  He's dyslexic and his spelling is atrocious.<br>  I have a BA in English.<br>  <br>  But we still get along. It's because we love each other.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	I agree with the second answer. Grammar and spelling are some of my biggest pet-peeves, yet I married probably the worst speller I've ever met. But I can tell you this: talk to your lady about it. After a while my husband stated that it made him feel ignorant - which he most definitely is not - when I corrected his spelling, so now I try to only correct his spelling when he has me proofread documents for work, sale ad's, etc. Be sure to mention that you have enough of being "formal" at work, and that it bothers you that you can't relax enough during your time off to be a little silly and make up your own words.<br>  <br>  If your girlfriend is an English or Linguistics major or something along those lines, though, don't expect her to change, haha.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Speaking English properly IS a mark of intelligence. For instance, it's THROUGH, not threw. I'm with her, these errors make you sound ignorant.|`|32QCv0l1aa	of course you have to be able to let your guard down when you're not at work!!!!!!! and frankly, if it's about something as little as that, then tell her!!!! Tell her it's damn annoying, that it gets on your nerves, and that when you're at home you want to be able to talk the way you want, act the way you want, live the way you want.... !!!! Tell her this nicely though, if you don't want her to take it personally of course. <br>  <br>  <br>  But you're absolutely right, and you should talk to her about it!! Good luck.

Huh?<br>  <br>  Then you tell us what NOT to solve your problem with (it's the same solution that BILLIONS of people  who are apart use everyday - the phone) and then just give us a solution YOURSELF by saying...<br>  <br>  "Which means I just go away and don't contact him?"<br>  <br>      Do we think you should just go away and not contact him????<br>  <br>  Your REAL question IS .....My boyfriend is realy upset with my leaving and I don't want to deal with it so,,,,,what do you think if I just go away and don't contact him?<br>  <br>  That's what your real question is - your families have nothing to do with it - these days there's hundreds of ways to keep in contact with someone, I mean, you each have YOUR OWN cell phone right????...like the OP said there's webcams, the internet email, regular mail,...so you should be able to stay in touch without ANYONE knowing about it.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your real question....<br>  If you're the shallow heartless kind of person who can go out with someone for 3 years and then just "disappear in the night" (otherwise known as abondonement) then by all means, go right ahead and do that.<br>  But please don't look to the great people on Yahoo Answers to agree with you in doing that.<br>  <br>  "Or do you think I should Break up silently without hurting him by talking about my last few days with him in front of him?"<br>  <br>  What the heck does that even mean? Break up "Silently"??? Like if you do it "quietly" enough - don't really talk about it but do it infront of him???? - then, what....it will hurt him less????<br>  <br>  There's somthing wrong with you.<br>  <br>  Here's an idea you didn't think of ....yet....<br>  <br>  Tell him you really really love him and want to get married because you're pregnant with his baby and THEN just "disappear".<br>  This way, maybe, just maybe, you could make him feel bad enough to kill himself and then you won't have to deal with it all.<br>  <br>  How's that for a Yahoo Answer?|`|bMWWvfd6aa	if u really love him and he loves u in d same way..... dnt break up.... tell him about ur problems bt if he dsnt understand, than u shud move on.....|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	Well if you are like 19 yrs old then is better that you leave him you are too young to get in to this kind of things.

My only suggestion is that you also try to forget him and start leading a new life.. Try to have a place change and a weather change for getting rid off his thoughts and memories.. or consult a psychyatrist... Am sure this will solve your problem...|`|07xi6IOSaa	Seems like a stress reaction. Anxiety, or an inner kind of stress that manifests with the shivering.

eu4q4WbEaa	with an arranged marriage...you start your life by looking at him as your "husband"...and even that word bonds you both. And you try to make him happy because he is after all your husband while he too tries to make you happy...and you fall in love...<br>  <br>  And what I really like about it is that you would not have dated anyone before so you do not compare him with anyone and he will be your first in everything and you will be his first. The bond even grows more then...<br>  <br>  The people I have seen with arranged marriages are all very happy...while the ones that are married for love...I have actually just seen 5 successful ones over the years...|`|14oKthXmaa	yes boy go for a arrange marriage with her.<br>  <br>  because i know the cases of love marriaged couples who not have happy marriage life.<br>  <br>  and maximum arrange marriaged couples get happy married life.<br>  <br>  REASON:love marriaged couples love each oter so much before marriage and after marriage they face disputes with each other.<br>  because they use their all love quota before marriage & after marriage they not have love left for each other.|`|RD7A4NAtaa	Your choice is what's important here... do what you think is right!<br>  <br>  In my opinion, arranged marriages are wrong as they go against one of the basic human rights... free choice.<br>  I would never advise someone to commit to an arranged marriage, but then again, if it's arranged, what choice do you really have? If you don't go through with it, your family disowns you and, as you say, you are left on your own... which is the best option for you?<br>  <br>  Any marriage can break down!|`|onbwN4csaa	If it's not a love marriage. what makes you think that there will ever be love anywhere throughout the arrange marriage ??

ANhYfjNQaa	Ejaculation is a process completely controlled by the mind.Natural treatments are best to cure premature ejaculation<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prejaculationcure.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.prejaculationcure.info</a>|`|OyBuEpOTaa	He may need a doctor. or you may just be sexually incompatable. It's no ones fault. you can't make him last longer. He needs to find out if there is a problem, or if it is his nature.|`|SjICsoV6aa	20 minutes is not that bad seriously....maybe if you need more time alternate him with a toy.    It can be enjoyable to watch your lady pleasure herself and then jump in at the end to finish the job.  Or you can just start a little earlier and be "ready" for him.  They make decensitisers (sp) for men but they don't work that well for me.  Maybe your just way too fine for him and you need to cover up a bit more and then ...S L O W L Y  give it to him.  Women can always keep going most of them just don't want to.  lol good luck|`|oLj0VTX5aa	I suggest you stop worrying about his performance and start focusing on your performance. If you are distracted or frustrated, you're not going to be sexually satisfied.  Concentrate on what's going on and what is working for you, and try to make it work.  It's not always the guys fault.  They get tired and can't think of grandma the entire time.  ;)|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	maybe whenever he starts to feel an orgasm coming, he can go down on you or just 'pull out' and focus on YOUR needs and when he feels it kind of go away, start again! <br>  gosh, i felt awkward answering this question.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	20 minutes not enough? You mean with forplay? Of course, thats not enough for a horny chick like you.<br>  Give him massages and spend more time in foreplay.|`|OjQpIa75aa	Double condom reduces sensitivity and he should go for ageeees|`|YJ7KdBFbaa	Try this, start to mess around in bed to get each other in the mood. End up giving him a hand job or oral sex...which every you want...until he ejaculates. Have him finger you during this. After he ejaculates have him keep fingering you and keep playing with him. In a minute or two he will be ready for another go. It should be much longer<br>  <br>  Also use a condom, it makes it last longer. I use Trojan Extended Pleasure. When my girlfriend and i do what i just told you to do, it lasts a long time. About 10 minutes of messing around. 5 minutes of staying in the mood. And another hour of sex with switching positions to keep things fun. I think an hour of sex would be long enough for you.|`|AA10596340	The subject of premature ejaculation is pretty huge, and there are lots of different ways to go about curing it, depending on your preferences and situation.<br>  <br>  If he sincerely wants to work on it, he can "train" himself (body and mind) to last longer, and you can help him with that process. This is way more effective over the long term than using topical gels or creams. Physical props like wearing 2 condoms might be "a quick fix" that helps to begin with, but shouldn't be considered long term solutions.<br>  <br>  It involves becoming aware of the stages of arousal, and then slowly but surely building the self-control to prolong orgasm, which can be broken down in stages. Some of the previous answers are on the right track, such as: <br>  <br>  When he approaches the point of no return, he should stop and wait, or do the squeeze technique (or you do it for him.) He should focus on whole-body sensuality, including satisfying you first, and not on his own orgasm. He should use deep, rhythmic breathing to help relax and provide a focal point other than orgasm. And, he should practice all of the above during masturbation (alone or with you) in order to extend his arousal cycle, on both a mental and physical level. <br>  <br>  If you really like/love him, be patient and work with him. This is tough for most guys, and in terms of nature (evolution, etc.) the more quickly a male can ejaculate, the better chances he has of survival and procreation without being eaten by a predator. In other words, this reflex is to a large degree hard wired into us. Check out the free articles at the blog below, and I highly recommend Ejaculation Trainer too (see blog.) It has some quality information in it.|`|CGXgGWxcaa	what works for me, Is FOREPLAY, Lots of it. I'm talking an hour min. Then when things are really heating up, Slow it down. And the main thing is talk to him,so he knows exactly what it takes to ring your bell.

Try to do things what he likes. Try to spend more time with him and try to keep in contact with him whenever necessary..<br>  For starting love and like, you need to understanding is important. <br>  So first try to understand him first and then do all these things.

I mean, you have offered to talk about it but they have declined so you have tried your best to work things out. I'm afraid that's all you can do - your best. Some friendships just don't work out, even if they were amazing before. <br>  I've drifted away from/fallen out with a few friends and it was terrible because we did everything together and they were like sisters to me but as people change, so do relationships. <br>  They sound like they have become not very nice people and hanging with not very nice people too so I would try to move on a bit. Easier said than done though. <br>  Your friend sounds nice, I would stick with her. :)|`|nEQZtD7Daa	Geee what a surprise that relationships and people are complicated!!!   The answer to your question is simple enough, it's called:  WILL POWER.<br>  <br>  In regards to how you "feel" remember that nobody can make you "feel" good or bad.  How you "feel" is a personal choice...that power bleongs to you.  It is an individual choice on how one reacts or feels about events or certain situations.  As human beings each of us is responsible for our own actions.    If one feels bad it's generally caused from something they've done wrong.  Also known as guilt.<br>  <br>  So ask yourself often:  (i.) what I'm I feeling;  (ii.) why am I feeling that way; and (iii.) what am I going to do about it:  Option A; B; or C.   It's your Life and your decision(s) that make you feel good or bad.  Think about it.   <br>  <br>  One more thing.  Life is like a roller-coaster ride, right now your at the age where things are coming at you fast and moving up and down and all around.  Just hang on, scream every now and then, cry when you have to, but make sure you laugh, and do your best to enjoy the ride.   Good luck
2SmIk1PQaa	probably, good job, good looks, I would be :)<br>  it's their fault for not planning ahead in school, <br>  are they closer in age?<br>  maybe because they grew up being the two youngest, they got used to it being just them!

The only way of making it right is talking to someone about it and i think the best person would be your mom.<br>  Good luck ! <br>  =] xx.
oSfXwfnfaa	Maybe cause a lot of people like to root for the good-guy underdog? there has to be conflict in stories, and one of the usual kinds in love stories is the love triangle, or someone loving someone else who already has a significant other. then people can root for that person, who, because of his plight, also usually appears the most sympathetic. and it would be easier for the audience to side with the hero if the hero's object of affection's boyfriend is the bad guy, or is portrayed as unlikable. personally though, i think it would be better if both hero and girl's boyfriend are equally likable, since it provides more of a competition and the audience won't be forced into liking one because the other is the 'bad guy'.|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	Well most of the time is guys and is the truth woman are more into feelling and if the guy is too he wont do that kind of things.|`|DkmWYScQaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I believe there must have some good guys or good girls out there, not every one is evil, if something happened in relationship now, than must complaining why all the guy are so bad like a evil, actually it's just that we haven't meet the right one yet, <br>  <br>  to me LOVE is very simple, it;s depend us, if you going to make everything complicated than everything become complicated, when something happen don't always thinking the problem must from him, actually sometime is just from ourself, but we just don't know, because we always judge other people more than judge ourself, so everything that you do have to think twise before we do,<br>  <br>  in life we must get hurt from love or other relationship, but is good for us to learn what is love, if one day you know what is about love, learn to love other people, than you can reply an answer from yourself,<br>  <br>  Good Luck ! ! !|`|Xl4o7tRqaa	people think girls can get away with everything so the guys get blamed|`|eAx9wk1zaa	doesnt matter if i play bad or good, i will always win|`|4ZxMfSjYaa	i think it is just how it goes these days|`|bMWWvfd6aa	i dunno...... i think people like it that way only...... if u wanna change it, try writing a book n remembr that it is not necessary that movies show the right thing always........ its jst 4 our entertainment......
OyBuEpOTaa	if you don't work go out and find a job. It can be a part time job to start.  Find groups that share you interests. But not computer involved.

be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Honey,<br>              It is because that you dont want to get hurt again..For example if you start talking to him again and if once again he hurts you then you are not ready to accept that.. so you are not talking to him wantedly by controlling all your emotions...|`|wmBK9uASaa	It`s to protect ourselves from further hurt....|`|6Za54Wxbaa	i think its because we protect our selves from getting hurt again|`|9j2k2KeZaa	protection|`|07xi6IOSaa	To protect our emotions from FEELING the hurt that we know we are feeling. Its a control thing, and a defense mechanism. I do it alot as well. Learning though, that you can't control everything and sometimes you just HAVE to allow yourself to be vulnerable.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean you lost or are a loser or anything when those things end. It means you had the strength and heart to TRY. All or nothing. You allowed yourself the opportunity to try to be happy.....to shoot for the stars and land on the moon. There is no fault or error in that.<br>  <br>  There is also no fault or error in not speaking to him anymore. Just because you work together doesn't mean you have to be friends or even friendly with him. The fact of the matter is the way he broke up with you (be honest...him telling you that he didn't want a relationship, only fun....that was HIM breaking up with YOU) sounds like he isn't a good choice anyhow. Move on and don't be afraid to fall in love again.<br>  <br>  But the next time around.....make the guy WORK for and EARN your affection and attention. Have a  good night.|`|Oyvlt2vyaa	It's a self defence thing.  I'm guessing your afraid to let him back in, knowing that he is not into anything serious right now.  Needing space away from him is normal, and it makes getting over him easier.  Also, now that you've broken up, if you made it perfectly clear how you felt about him then you stand a good chance of getting rejected or hurt even more.  It's something your subconscious is to protect your conscious mind, although it doesn't sound like it's working too well.  Good luck getting over him, it will come with time.  Meanwhile, minimise contact and distract yourself with hobbies, family and friends.

No forgiveness sorry.|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	yes, because God tells us we have to forgive people for stuff they do to us or else He won't forgive us<br>  <br>  so yeah, I would|`|XR3wwNFhaa	forgive. but avoid her afterwards.|`|AA12077420	I can never get over that,but then we are different,you might have a more forgiving heart.|`|2ca5bf9bf3ccc94cb295d7908271ed30aa	don't do man trust me on this i know from experience, i took my girl back after she cheated on me then she broke up with me to go out with this other guy|`|AA12032536	You can forgive..but can you forget, think of the future, would you ever be able to trust her again, you have to look inside yourself!

07xi6IOSaa	Talk to him. You will never know unless you speak up. Life is to short and tomorrow isn't promised to anyone. Start learning to be good to yourself, and be true to yourself by not wasting a single day.<br>  <br>  Start by telling him that you are interested in becoming more than just friends with him because you feel more for him than friendship. Tell him all the things about him that you are attracted to, and that you adore. He will be both surprised and flattered at your admission. Don't push. Don't ask for answers from him....just inform him of how YOU feel.|`|d5fcda0b1b369414afee0511cbb3bf20aa	I would just ask him questions to throw hints in there like: What do you like about a girl? If he says long hair, I would be like I have long hair. Then laugh it off like it was a joke. Or you could be like someone said we would make a cute couple and see how he responds.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|sAnXhDaraa	Well there are signs:If the guy often wants to tell you something and he is shy he likes you and I hope he likes you as much as you do!|`|jD1xacNbaa	I think every girl would know if a guy likes them<br>  But you should flirt alittle bit, not alot be carfull you dont show that your all over him 'I'll just freak him out'<br>  Hope I helped :3|`|be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Prish,<br>            Its true that love will not come by itself.

tBaCFTtBaa	it sounds to me like you both felt like the other is just a friend or a brother/sister feeling.  no harm, because you even said you didn't feel as strongly about her as you have in the past with other girls. wish her luck with her new guy, and maybe make her regret her decision by showing her how perfect you can be.  good luck!|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	I think she was seeing another guy while she was dating you, i think is not fair unless she told you that she was doing that.

uqnQ9Y9haa	Their kisses|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	X = sex jokses and xxx = f***|`|d51rpXduaa	They are kisses. I do not think its appropriate to send those and say i love you to a friend if they or you are in a relationship.<br>  <br>  However, you'll find alot of people think its okay.
BjyXKFpRaa	I really don't know what to tell you but ask her what did your words mean to her.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	she took it as a compliment~it was a nice thing to do|`|OyBuEpOTaa	you seem to be thinking about  her a lot. maybe you are wishing she was your fiance. don't interfere in her life. she's married.|`|07xi6IOSaa	She was probably surprised, and flattered as well. You definitely gave her an added little boost and a smile for the day. Women often go unappreciated and stuck in their daily ruts, especially after they have families.<br>  <br>  Just as you brought this woman a smile with this simple revelation, please always remember to give your wife-to-be that same little pick-me-up from time to time. I guarantee that she'll ADORE you for it, and will thank God daily for your love.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	she was probably thinking you saw her more as a mother figure. if someone said that to me, i might be flattered but i would probably be thinking "why the **** did he tell me that?!"|`|d36OrpbDaa	i would be really flattered.  that was very kind of you.

If you aren't at least 16, you're too young for dating one-on-one anyway. You can be friends with a boy, keep the romance out of it until at least 16, and no sex until at least 18.<br>  <br>  You'll never convince your parents it's okay for you to date, if you don't behave in an age appropriate and responsible manner.

m81dfyOYaa	Sorry I don't know what the love courts are.
XgZGJWFBaa	Honestly he probably wants his cake and eat it too, had he not been caught he most probably would have tried to continue the relationship with you for as long as he could.<br>  You obviously give him something he is lacking, from his marriage resulting in him cheating in the first place. Thou he may have chosen to return to his wife he is hoping that he woo you enough that you will want to continue to have a relationship with him, even an emotional affair.<br>  Stay clear from him as when the wife finds out again she will be wild and you will most probably in the cross fire as this time she knows you know his married, and she obviously loves her husband and will believe him regardless of what Truly happened.<br>  I suggest that you send him a text message saying that it is over between the two of you and that he has chosen to be with his wife as you have chosen to move on with your life and if he does not stop contacting you, you will have no choice but to let his wife know his still contacting you.<br>  Keep every text he sends you and track when he calls you so you have prove that he is indeed still contacting you etc.<br>  Good luck|`|MkKvGdxKaa	You are having sex with a man you know is married. you are just as responsible for the hurt on his wife as he is. you are also equally immoral. i hope his wife leaves him this time. the two of you belong together sweetie.

Sounds more like an unpaid therapist, verging on an unpaid whore - sorry, but true.<br>  Rest assured, if he doesn't hook up with you, he'll hook up with someone else...he may have already. If he can cheat on his wife, he can cheat on you and whoever else he so chooses - yes? no? yes!<br>  If his marriage was over, and you were the one he wanted to be with and were the right person to be with, then he would be with you.

He has come back as many do (including my husband) because he thinks he knows how he got caught the first time so this time if he can get yu do agree he will get away with it.

His wife will be trying so hard to catch him out now that he will get caught again and you know who she will turn all her hurt pain and Rage too... YOU.

You need to be the good person here and tell him to F*CK OFF.  The guy is a piece of sh*t, and doesn't respect you or his poor wife.  Otherwise he wouldn't be using you for sex and betraying his wife.<br>  <br>  You also need to call his wife and tell him he is trying to hook up with you again.

Now that you know he is married..don't play any of his games again. He has no respect for his wife, you, or himself.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	Women like you are a dime a dozen...Did you come out from under a rock? This man is using you. This man will never leave his wife, you are just the excitement on the side and if it weren't you, it would be someone else. His wife probably did forgive him and she also probably knows he will do it again. But...then again, she's his wife and she pretty much says whether she will ever let him go or not. I don't think she will. She has enough ammo to bury him if she wanted to. Maybe she just giving enough rope to hang himself. And there is just some men just won't ever learn, they think with the wrong head and if you choose to spend your life cheating with a married man, thats your choice.. But please remember, you can waste alot of years of your life for absolutley nothing, , next thing you know, you are in your 50"s and you have nothing but some sad memories of what you thought was love.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Because he knows that even if he is caught again, his wife will take him back. By taking him back, it's almost like she's given him permission to go out and cheat rather than punishing him.<br>  <br>  He is really disgusting and obviously does not respect you or his wife. If he respected you at all, he would not try to get back with you after you ended it with him because he was married. And he does not respect his wife. He is a dirtbag|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Doesn't matter what he wants or what his reasons are.  Is this what you want?  Do you want to be his mistress only?  I am not judging you.  I just don't think he wants to leave his wife and I don't think you should expect him too.  Also, remember that sometimes these things end violently.  If it isn't her or him, it could be one of his other mistresses that goes crazy.|`|xsvDrtrRaa	you know what for me you shouldn't ask why would he cheat again...i mean you know that he cheats and if he did it he will do it again and again. for me you should start avoiding yourself to be with him. he have this family of his own and you deserve one for yourself too.. you wouldn't like to be called a home wrecker right...?|`|Zca1PGERaa	hed have to be a hell of a dumb to think he can get away with it again hes bound to have been told anymore and its a divorce he hasnt left her so he obviously loves her and wants to remain married to her<br>  <br>  thing is if you answer your calls itl be you that gets the hassle from his wife|`|AA10065197	because hes scum dont go out with him|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	Sometimes it's easier to talk with someone you aren't married to.  Part of it is, sometimes all you seem to have to talk about are the kids, the bills, the dog barfing on the floor, and what needs fixed.  With someone you aren't married to, you talk about your dreams, what you see in your future.<br>  <br>  Another words, he can be who he was BEFORE he got married with you.  <br>  <br>  Yes, he's willing to risk his marriage to have that again.  You remind him of what it was like when he didn't have responsibilities.  <br>  <br>  It seems silly, but that's what happens.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember is, if he left his wife, those responsibilities don't go away if he has children. And if he married again, those same responsibilities would be there again.  It's easy to fall into talking about the daily mundane things with the person you're married to....it takes effort to remember everyone has dreams.|`|9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, You will learn the hard way, once a cheater always a cheater. Why waste your life on a man that will never commit fully to you, also how do you know he only has you on the side there may also be someone else as well. My husband couldn't help himself, i just couldn't catch him but eventually i did, i soon got rid of him. I don't think for one minute his wife is turning a blind eye, she just dosent know, so put yourself in her place how would you feel if that was your husband. Get out while you can, men like this make me sick.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	You have it backwards you are the ridiculous one for taking him back because odds are he is sneaking around behind his wife's back and she knows nothing about it. On the other hand you know he is a married man now but you are the one who is choosing to turn a blind eye to that. So who's fooling who here? You ask why he would come back to you when his wife has taken him back. He came back to you because you let him come back . Has it ever dawned on you that his wife only keeps him around for the kids if they have any. I bet he is in the dog house at home so it would stand to reason why he would go around you.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	I highly doubt that his wife has suddenly decided that it's okay for her husband to sleep with another woman. <br>  He's come back because he obviously still thinks he can. Things have settled down at home again and he's feeling free to indulge himself in a little side action. <br>  Look, if his wife didn't kick him out the door the first time she found out she is obviously either weak or is very dependant on him, either finacially or emotionally. <br>  <br>  Regardless of that, do you really want to be playing second fiddle to someone? No matter what he tells you, he remains married and with marriage comes obligation. Obviously there is no friction on her side of the relationship so it sounds like this guy is bored in his marriage and wants the best of everything, he likes the security of being married and knowing he can go home to his dutiful wife while still being able to get his rocks off with you whenever he likes. <br>  For some men cheating is like a disease, they like the rush of being secretive, seductive but ultimately untouchable. No matter what happens, either way he's totally safe. He has a wife at home taking care of him there and a girlfriend on the side providing sex. <br>  <br>  You need to save yourself the heartache that this guy will undoubtedly bring and tell him to go back to his wife or find someone else to play with. The last time it happened you were ignorant of his marriage, now that you know, think about how his wife is going to feel. More to the fact, think about how you feel. Are you okay with being used? Because no matter what he says, that's what is happening. Are you okay to sit at home alone pining for your boyfriend who is curled up in bed beside his wife, possibly having sex with her? Nothing good will come of taking this guy back, he is ruining all your lives with his actions. <br>  Get rid of him and advise his wife to do the same. Once a cheater always a cheater and if it was so easy for him to cheat on his wife, what makes you so sure he's not  going to cheat on you as well?? Don't become the other woman. Lies and deceit are not good things to base a relationship on and I'm sure your smart enough to realise you can do better than being the second choice of a married man.
Klb8kTtDaa	The thing you should be focusing on is the abusive behavior. <br>  Even though he is "only" violent towards inanimate objects (the computer), it is only time until he turns that anger towards you or your children.  <br>  It is typical abusive behavior - he gets angry (probably blames it on you somehow) and acts out, then feels remorseful and apologizes and says he knows how wrong he is. <br>  If it is as bad as you say, he needs to get help, or you need to get out - for your children's sake. Break the cycle of abuse, because you bet your little kids are seeing this and they will be affected by it, regardless of age.<br>  Another thing abusers do is to give you reasons why  you have to stay with them - that you will have nothing if you leave (the car comment). Has he also isolated you from former friends? Really think about it - does he give you no time to see your friends so you have drifted apart?<br>  For the other part - I have 2 kids - 4 weeks and 18 months old. I'm on maternity leave now, and when my husband gets home from work, I try to give him time to sleep, even though I can be pulling my hair out sometimes. That is what a marriage is - a give and take. When I was recovering from the latest birth, he was the primary caregiver for the older kid, without a complaint. <br>  I'm not saying he should live a bachelor life, but give the guy a break if he wants to get 9 hours of sleep one day a week, as long as he does things with the kids and you.  He can't expect the kids to remain quiet though. <br>  As far as communication - wait until you are both in a relaxed mood, and don't accuse... instead of "You never help clear dishes", say "I'd really like it if you cleared the dishes on the weekends". My experience is that men need clearcut expectations and not this whole "if you loved me, you'd know what I am angry about" crap.|`|MkKvGdxKaa	On the first question, of course he should get a lie in til 10am on a saturday morning!!! He gets hardley any sleep during the week!!! Yes you have kids but as a family i think the kids can understand to keep in down for a couple of hour on a sat morn so the man who provides for them all week can get a bit if kip!!! If you arent getting enough sleep, talk to him asnd sort something for you too. Sounds like he'll do it if it did it for you when you were sick.<br>  <br>  The violence isnt acceptable, I agree, nor is the control issues he has. There seems to be a lot of resentment and anger in this marriage and I think it's counselling you both need together. From the things he's saying it sounds to me like he feels totally worthless and unappreciated. Dont say i blame him, since he's telling you he's knackered and you think he's selfish needing to catch up with his sleep. Look at what he does all week. and before you say you do plenty too, as im sure you do, you being selfless isnt his problem. tell him you need time too and sort yourselves out. Yes you are both parents. But you are people too. your own life and rights shouldnt stop completely because you have kids. live your life like that and you are on a one way road to disaster. Good luck to you both.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just re-reding my answer and think I didnt point out that his controlling behaviour is totally unacceptable. As much as im giving possible reason why he may be like that, it has to stop. Should you continue? Yes. but i feel maybe he needs to be temporarily living somewhere else while you work through things. and maybe another dose of anger management wouldnt go amiss.|`|dGNl6LLSaa	Sometimes the (men) hunters of the family feel like they can't pls everyone, work all week and have a good sleep in on W/end. Look he dont wanna leave,thats why he had nowhere to go. He just said it. I do...now if ya love him just take a couple of days rest or go out together in the evening..dont 4get just cause ya married dont mean ya cant act sexy together...it only takes one to start it the other will follow...you will be both happy. Im in the same situatation but im the hubby. But I though somthings round abit , but never hit my wife(no Excuse) but he's frustrated with no answers.. next time You Sleep in ..good luk|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Well, forget the sleeping in part. He is smashing things and controlling you. That is why i would go. he doesn't respect what you do for the family and is focused in on how he PAYS for everything. Totally unacceptable.|`|ZJCoUMijaa	You serious?? 10 am is freakin early.. it's not like he's in boot camp|`|AA11447210	Do what's best for you and your kids. Personally, I'd find it hard to stay with someone who I wasn't happy with, wasn't in love with, and kept me stressed and on edge all the time. This life is too short to feel that way when there are other options.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	For his sake, he better make it work with you because I can't see anyone else putting up with him.  A schedule should be worked out somehow so that both of you get alone time for things at home and alone time for things to do outside of the house.  He can't expect to sleep in every weekend.  And he should be reminded that just because the car/house is in his name, doesn't mean that it won't be yours in a divorce.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Better put up with it you do not want to be one of those women who are dead broke after child support stops.<br>  <br>  Yes, you are right, its not the 50s anymore, Iam seeing how wonderfull it is for a man to be married when it is not the 50s. I bet your man feels like a real idiot for getting married and is now thinking of all the guys who told him, no man dont do it dont do it.<br>  <br>  But hey, if you want to be a btch and deprive your kids of their father and of resources and of course showing them how wonderfull it is to get married and then being taken to the cleaners by an ungratefull ex witch so they can look forward to getting married themselves, go right ahead, you would not be the first and you wont be the last.|`|fLU63N4kaa	When you say you don't communicate well, is it because you don't try? Or because when you do, it just doesn't work? <br>  <br>  Either way, the best thing I could suggest would be marriage counselling. Good luck, hope everything works out!|`|qw7BmBq6aa	You need a reality check, if he's tired and needs to sleep until 10 am let him.  You said so yourself he works long hours and is studying, cut the man some slack or he's gonna end up cheating on you with someone who makes him happy.
FZKFLTyLaa	Good is a relative term. Individual tastes vary so much.<br>  If you try one and don't like it I'm unsure what their return policy is, but I KNOW I don't want a used one!!

be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Honey,<br>  If you are really sure that you like that guy then make sure that you understand him properly in all the aspects...like his hobbies, his fav foods, passtime etc., so that you can attract him by following all his likes and dislikes..And ask him suddenly if he likes you or not...<br>  Am sure once he observes all this from you.. he will surely approach you for asking what is that you are doing and then you can let him know that you like him and love him a lot... and if he really understands you, he will inturn starts loving you...<br>  <br>  All the best honey!!!!!!!|`|X6aRNbqKaa	Don't jump on him just yet!  He is getting out of a relationship for many reasons I am sure. One of them might be he needs his space for a while. Casually show your interest by flirting with him, and see if he returns such behavior. Go and have fun with him as friends. If it is supposed to work out, he will be attracted to the true you. You won't need to pull the love along. The worst thing is to jump in right now and express such feelings when he might be unsure of wanting a relationship and you don't want to get him when he is absorbed in the other girl and what happened. You want him when he can really appreciate you.
1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	The good thing is that she is still talking to you.  She hasn't shut down communication.  She is being open and (brutally) honest about her opinions.  She has no right to make you feel guilty.  She does have 8 other children.  She will come around.  She is venting and letting off steam.  She will see how happy you are, and that will be her joy.  Give her time, visit/call when you can, and tell her you love her as much as possible.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	Try to remember that sometimes as people age, they become more childish and more selfish.  She wants what she wants, when she wants it.  What she wants is YOU.  <br>  <br>  Now, this may be because you're the only child she's really comfortable with.  It may be because she assigned you the role of parental caretaker.  It doesn't really matter, because you're not filling that role for her and she's just not happy about it.<br>  <br>  Are any of the other kids taking care of her?  Checking on her regularly?  Helping her?  If the answers are "yes", then when you talk with her, tell her that you hear whomever was there last week, and she's so lucky to have them.   So, you need to keep up with your brothers and sisters and get status reports on who is seeing Mom.  Make sure you tell them how wonderful they are (I suspect Mom won't).  Then when you talk with Mom, make sure you let her know you're keeping up with things.<br>  <br>  As hard as it is, don't be angry with her or hurt.  She's not the same person she was....if you think of her more as a really wrinkled 3 year old, you have a better grasp of where she is.  <br>  <br>  When she tells you she resents you, tell her you can understand that, but you don't resent her...for trying to make you feel guilty...that you understand she's feeling alone and abandoned by you, but you're still here for her...just further away.  Plus, lucky for her, she has...name all the siblings who spend time with her...around.<br>  <br>  You're not going to WIN this, but you can not get sucked into it.<br>  <br>  The reality is, she's 84.  Chances are, she doesn't have all that much time left, and there's no reason for you to spend the last few years feeling resentment towards her.  Remember, she's basically  on the same emotional level as a 3 year old...and that you do love her...and she loves you.  She's just doing the 84 year old version of when a 3 year old says, "I HATE YOU",,,when they don't get their own way.<br>  <br>  Deep breath, hon, and hang in there.|`|M5yDMjlLaa	qwewe|`|09k5GLLkaa	Seems like you are dealing with your mom just fine. Just gotta take into consideration her age for one. Plus she must be the type of person who loves to have all of her family around her at all times.  You are doing the only thing that you can do really and that is to speak nice and soft to her and telling her the truth. Your life is with your husband and kids now and not with your mom or by her side. If she was on her death bed well then that is a different story. You are letting her get to you and you shouldn't let her do that. Just keep in mind what she is doing and just keep doing as you are doing. I really do understand what you are going through and it's not fun to hear the crap you get from a loved one especially your mom. You are also right about unconditional love. Hang in there and don't let mom bring you down. Love her and stay in touch with her is about all you can do. (smile)|`|QPVEL0NLaa	Mommy Dearest is playing with your emotions because you had the nerve to make your own decisions and live your own life. She sounds like a controlling, bitter old woman. Any decent parent knows that their job is to raise and prepare your children to live their own lives. The problem with your Mother is she will not let go. You didi nothing wrong. I know its tough but you have to take care of YOUR life now.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Honestly?  Your mom sounds like she's either losing her marbles, or she's a manipulative control freak.<br>  <br>  I have a psychotic mother like yourself.  She uses every opportunity to make me feel bad for not coming over every day of my life.  She gets mad if I don't call her, but refuses to pick up the phone herself.  Why?  Because it's all a game of control.  Your mom, like mine, has found power in controling others emotionally.  <br>  <br>  This won't stop, its who she is, maybe you're just realising this now, but that it's always been this way.  Only way to deal with it is not to argue, because she'll always just turn around and cus you out.  Tell her point blank to stop putting rediculous ideas in her head, and to stop trying to guild you.  Tell her you will hang up the next time she pulls this kind of stunt. Then hang up if she tries to be a cow about things.<br>  <br>  You need to give tough love in this situation otehrwise she will continue to try and guilt and manipulate you.|`|BkYQh4Yhaa	thank you!!! I feel as though I wrote this letter myself. I am relieved to see that I am not the only one with a mother like this. I am an only child and my mother has been very demanding my entire life. thank you to all that answered. your responses have helped me "see the light" if you will.|`|QK1jfKG9aa	she is just lonely, thats why she tells you all that, keep trying to say intouch with her even if she doesnt agree to take your calls, she will like the attention anyways|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Not to be rude, but I really can't focus on the question here because of the lack of punctuation. :(|`|LRJmHA7vaa	My Mother used to try to make me feel bad for things also. One day she called me and started in, I said Mom can you hang on a minute, I need to go pack a bag, she asked me why and I said Well if Im going on a guilt trip then Im gonna need a few things. She laughed so hard and now when she starts, which is rare, all I have to do is ask her if I need to pack. Shuts her up every time. The other thing I have done, is when she gets started, I just say ok Mom Love you Bye. And hang up.
OsG3AEwjaa	This is a hard one actually, you could think of the negatives, being that he was talking to other girls and wanted to get to know them and that you don't think he actually likes you, or you could think, he wanted to get to know those girls but he chose you to be his girlfriend. A lot of guys do that to boost their self esteem, and if a girl replies they suddenly feel more confident in themselves.<br>  <br>  I think you should trust him though (:
yPX1E3Bbaa	why do you hate his father so much? honestly, i agree with your husband to let his father live with you guys. who else going to take care of him? and your husband is right, blood is thicker than water. about his nephew, instead of both of you yelling and arguing with each other, why don't both of you sit down and talk about it calmly together. if both of you just talk calmly and nicely, i am sure both of you can get your points across and then can make a decision from there. good luck.|`|09k5GLLkaa	Is there more to this story than what you are telling us? If not, then your husband is a weeney and needs his daddy I guess. Looks like you have two choices. Stay and raise the kid and put up with pops, of leave all 3 of those people and be happy. Everyone wants to be happy right? so pack your bags and let your little boy and his daddy have one another and let them raise the other little boy.

To put your husband in a it's me or him situation is a no win situation for you. You'll have to deal with it if you want to stay married. And, if you have no children I'd think you'd enjoy helping to raise the child. Even though you've outlined the details I think there's more going on here than you've posted.

If you can't talk to her or communicate with her, you will never have a chance with her. <br>  <br>  <br>  Join clubs that she is in, especially if you share common interests. <br>  Sit next to or near her at lunch and in class. <br>  <br>  <br>  Be casual, cool and confident not needy and annoying. <br>  Do NOT stalk a girl. <br>  <br>  <br>  Compliment her about something original (not hair, outfit, eyes, or things she probably hears all the time.) <br>  <br>  <br>  Learn to be a little charismatic! You want her to be attracted to your personality, not your achievements and your pay check. <br>  <br>  <br>  Eye contact is good. Smiling is good. Just don't forget to talk to her. <br>  Let her catch you watching her, but don't do it to much, she might think you are stalking her. <br>  <br>  <br>  If both of you have a MySpace, Facebook or YouTube, then comment her on myspace or YouTube profile. Comment on her pics or videos and message her about something you both like. Do not overdo the commenting. You might be a stalker. <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't do bad stuff that stands out like getting a teacher upset at you. This is not the way to impress a girl. <br>  <br>  <br>  Let her see the real you. Don't be ashamed of who you are. <br>  When trying to spark a conversation with her, try asking her about herself.

AN ABORTION! no, she'd probably be stupid enough to think that she can raise a baby at her age.
S9bEtVCSaa	LMAO you're funny.<br>  To answer your question - when I act all crazy people tend to not leave me alone. Maybe I should start acting more sane.|`|0BioKSmaaa	loool...ur wife is in on the plan right? :P <br>  <br>  and yes i do :P|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Cilla is right<br>  never had so much attention til I became insane.
7e4jxj3Daa	Shoulder length is nice.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	haha kissaz ---^<br>  <br>  <br>  till it hits the floor,,|`|3rvlB5YSaa	I am a girl, and I have long hair. I usually wear it kind of cute/messy... straight or wavy and let me tell you.. guys LOVE it. As soon as I grew my hair out, I was suddenly getting more guys hitting on me. A few guys I went out with would always grab my hair and tell me how sexy it was. My boyfriend now loves it, tells me all the time. So... to answer your question, yeah... long hair is sexy. Good luck ;)|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	Long and strait.  Wavy can be pulled off, but I frown at curly hair.  <br>  <br>  Anything strait suits me, but I think long, strait hair is the best on a girl.|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	little longer than shoulders, and an emo fringe usually works too|`|zY3ixLW6aa	i like your hair|`|55b60b3a3d24fb911ae382f06f0edc95aa	My favorite is long, straight or slightly wavy, blonde hair.  It would be ideal to find a girl who can naturally grow her hair down to her waist but choose to keep it just past the shoulders.  I am sooo not into short-haired women...no matter how cute they think they look.  Short hair is for men (like me); long hair is for women...makes them feminine, attractive, beautiful.  If she is intelligent and her personality is awesome, then I ultimately wouldn't really care how long she wants to keep it even if she `could` grow it long if she wanted to.  There's physical attraction...and then there's staying power.|`|ZoQwU2Juaa	usually no longer than the shoulders, or slightly shortish and choppy. too long is just disgusting, and too short is just creepy. kinda like yours in the display pick. i'm not hitting on you or anything, but that's about it. pretty pic. :)|`|LRffWATSaa	I like girls with medium length hair.  Probalby no longer than to their shoulders.|`|gELcwzNhaa	probably as long as RAPUNZELS|`|dISHCaqhaa	Yes.<br>               I really like long ,black hair. it should around 2.5 feet.|`|BTTFVbYYaa	i like guys with long hair why are you worried about pleasing men so  be you.|`|tvC7604haa	ehm..i am a girl and i like the girl with long hair...i prefer long to a back|`|shpzCyU3aa	as long as yours:p|`|70ca57a04b5a3528dd7a6ca971e3288faa	Yes, to the extant u can mentain.|`|1wFqxl3aaa	i loveeeeeeeeeee long hairrrr. yummm
yQ0OzEbZaa	I feel a woman should first be married and financially stable to bring a child into the world or even a whole litter of kids.  She’s still jobless and husband-less with 14 kids. On welfare. Splurging on video games. Moving out of a home owned by her mom, who’s $20,000 behind on mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now Octo-mommy is moving in to a half-million-dollar southern California home arranged for by dad and reportedly paid for with the cash she’s been raking in from her Octo-mom notoriety. <br>  <br>  I know I’m not the only one with the sick feeling that taxpayers will be on the hook for this financial basket case sooner rather than later.  o_O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-new-house/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-ne...</a>|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Angry at the fact that she all she is thinking about is her own greedy self. A responsible mother would never deliberately bring children into this world without a father, and that's exactly what she's done many times over. As a man who lost his father when he was five years old and knows and understands the importance of a father, she makes me sick to my stomach.|`|ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Now why would someone be jealous of her.....she has chosen to have children which she cannot take care of and now exploiting her children and sucking up the money.  She should be ashamed of herself.  There are so many people out there that want children and her she is popping them out without a care in the world.  DVD's come on be for real, what can America possibly learn from her other that exploiting her children.  She will need to hold on to what ever money she makes as these kids will need therapy in the future having a mother like her.|`|89TgOjXpaa	i ain't Jealous of her i just think she is exploiting her children for $$$<br>  <br>  i mean if she never had the children she wouldn't be making the $$ from the interviews or tv appearances or books, magazines and so forth and even her own mother is against what she has done by bringing more children in this world, do you realize that she has her other children with mental disabilities and she can't even afford that? yet she has the money to have IVF done and have more children and on her own website she begs for donation of money and pay her via pay pal that is so wrong she doesn't even have a job to support her children she lives with her own mother and the Govt pays for all her bullcrap! she is a bad mother in my books and has no idea what life is really about ... i mean she can't even give the kids their own house, she doesn't have a job, the father is no where to be seen, her own mother is against her, her other children have disabitlies and she can't afford to meet their needs but can afford IVF she is a money grabber and exploits her own babies.... she is a wh@re  and did you hear that a adult entertainment company asked her to do a pornographic film?|`|QTSsGbubaa	im not jealous of her n im not angry either i just think if u had so many kids y would u want them to plant 6 eggs when u cant even take care of the ones u have. it seems like she is using the kids as a way to get help and get rich..... but hey i dont have to take care of 14 kids... she does so more power to her|`|LX0EOsCHaa	that b itch just saw what jon and kate got when they had their kids. and figured hey what the hell i'm not married. i wanna get the money and all the free sh it|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	honestly, i'm not jealous of her. even when she becomes multimillionaire i still won't be jealous of her. it's just her actions of having a big family that she can't afford, is totally irresponsible and selfish. who do you think will suffer more? her or the kids?|`|SjLDdUh7aa	She is probably has already become a multimillionaire.  I think people are jealous of her.|`|8ATZ75OHaa	A little of both.<br>  <br>  I believe the feel she is using her children to be in the spotlight - and perhaps she is. She does have to figure out how to singlehandedly support and care for them and she's realizing it's not possible alone.<br>  <br>  While on the other hand, the rest of us have kids and struggle to give them a good life without outside help. Mothers often don't get to stay home (not work outside the home) and raise their kids while they're little - especially in this economy.<br>  <br>  It looks like Octomom will be making enough from all the publicity to hire nannies and stay home with her brood. So, on that level there is probably a jealousy. If she uses the system to support her children, the rest of us working moms are helping to pay for her to stay home with them.
yDgxAHO9aa	I don't want to complicate things for you, but a very very important topic that the bible and Jesus stressed is fleeing, whether it is from sin, or from things that might lead to sin.<br>  <br>  For example: I have a friend who I really like, but I know that if I spend time with him/her I will start gossiping, which is of course pretty bad. In that situation, the bible would say 'flee'<br>  <br>  You decide for yourself, but if you think this might lead to any sorts of temptation, you should try to control your emotions. And remember that if you're not sure you should always flee. <br>  <br>  Baby Jesus fled to Egypt when Herod wanted to kill him to teach us a lesson, after all he is Jesus.<br>  <br>  Here are some verses to help you out<br>  <br>  "But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after<br>  righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."<br>  1 Timothy 6:11<br>  <br>  "Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,<br>  charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a<br>  pure heart."<br>  2 Timothy 2:22<br>  <br>  "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and<br>  he will flee from you."<br>  James 4:7<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong though, of course it's ok to like someone, it just has to be in the right time, and being that young, I don't think it would go anywhere, but again you're pretty young, so don't worry about it too much, just keep these things in mind so when you get older you know that you should protect yourself<br>  good luck|`|0xGtNdveaa	This is an easy answer, but it will require you to do most of the work lol I am a christian to, have been for a long time now=D but the thing i learned most when it comes to dating and liking someone is to ask our Father. simply put, pray=D that will answer all the questions you have trust me=)|`|AKJKenFCaa	pray about it! If he is generally a good guy and he isn't causing anything destructive to happen to you, of course you can like him! just keep God part of it. If you know he is separating you from God, then it's time to create some distance though. Hope everything works out! and good for you! that's awesome :)|`|QRi5pjwwaa	it's completely fine when you have feelings for someone you can go out just don't go and get physically involed at least not yet|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Just live by your own convictions and let him have his own relationship with God.  Of course it's OK for you to keep your boyfriend.|`|xg15M77caa	Well if he is not a christian and you like him try invite him to a (church a christian youth group). And if he agrees it could let you spend more time with him.|`|y2ZTzfWHaa	Listen to your heart, that's where God is.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Haha, fail. Isn't being judgmental against the christian way or whatever?<br>  As long as he's a nice guy why does it matter? You're holding yourself back. And if you're going to try to force him to follow your beliefs you need a kick to the back of the head.|`|AA12354369	umm......well, as a christian you should wait until marriage for SEX, but relationships are a part of life.  keep on.|`|ajSQYvINaa	i'm not a born again christian but i'm pretty sure you can keep on liking a guy. pretty sure there is nothing that prohibits it in the Christian religion|`|OEZ57OUZaa	Get out of your fantasy world.|`|dSeKZlsQaa	It's fine to have feelings, just don't get physical!|`|rYCud1IQaa	you only need to ask once

i6Ix28IPaa	Is there some reason that you two cannot work this out together?<br>  <br>  Counseling has it's place; however, a counselor cannot fix the problem.  He or she can only make suggestions for change.  <br>  <br>  Difference in each spouse's schedule is typically a primary factor in this type of problem between couples.  You two have a modicum of control over that, don't you?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If that's what you think is best then maybe that's what you should do.<br>  <br>  As long as your husband is willing to go.|`|rpnFxnCQaa	Peach,<br>  <br>  I think that you and your husband should talk - if you don't already. This is key.<br>  <br>  Beside communication, you may want to spice things up ... My husband and I tried this website (recommended by my best friend) ... It is highly Erotic. When my husband and I tried some "games", it was like having a new partner. Like falling in Love all over again. We had still been in love but our relationship has since reached a new level. More completeness.

You have to get the other one in the mood.  Foreplay, foreplay, foreplay.  Always changes my mood.  lol|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Why can't either of you work to get the other person in the mood, as well? Foreplay is so great, but it's seriously underrated!|`|krd8tq3Iaa	Before taking that Step, you should try other things for both of you to get in the mood. Like with sex toys,wear something sexy that is going to blow his mind and role play etc. Nothing 2 kinky but just right. It is very important to have a healthy sex life. That way when ur in the mood, you can get him in the mood.<br>  Good Luck. But I am confident that this will work.|`|OojlfDlBaa	I don't think you need to see a counselor.

YfwTblzKaa	It truely breaks my heart that you feel he is the only one that will love you, but Im am so so proud of you for finally saying enough is enough. As well as being better for your son its better for you. Im positive that there is a great guy waiting for you out there and finally you have a chance to meet him because your not with this bum (sorry but its true). If your sons father can't see who you really are and the wonderful person that you are then you dont need him. Below is my fav little story/quote that I felt was perfect to help you and maybe even put a smile on your face, I know it does for me... |`|dN6RxFzgaa	Yahoo answers is a fantastic tool that can help you out with ALMOST anything......Unfortunately, I highly doubt a situation like this can be resolved this way.  You need more personal help and assistance, and from what I had read, you probably aren't the one who needs the talking to.<br>  <br>  Hope Cory won't get affected by the mayhem :) goodluck!|`|1940cfb59e487297a8aed3ba78b1c1e4aa	the best advice is to have a proper break from each other for a couple of week, without seeing anyone else. Remember before you can love anyone else you have to be able to love yourself, and from your question I dont think you do. After this then see how you go. <br>  <br>  But, your an adult and you should know, without the emotion, that anyone who bullies you has no place in your life. you have a kid with this guy, but is he a dad? From what you say he aint.<br>  <br>  If your baby is not picking up on this he soon will be. |`|XkNqNVZyaa	If you are still with this dude you need to leave him alone. He doesnt even help out the baby, He's the most important person in the whole situation. You are doing good by leaving him alone and just try to be the best mother you can be for your son. Dont think you are doing wrong for leaving and for your son not to have a dad, but it's better to have no father than one that doesnt do anything to better himself for his own child. Hope things are going better for you.|`|fSSE9cnLaa	Dump him. Your son is connected to you in every way and can pick up on your emotions. As long as you are happy, your son will be happy. Remember that! So make yourself happy :)|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	He seems a little immature.<br>  Sorry to say this but you deserve better.<br>  You should probably dump him,<br>  and move on and find yourself someone who acts more  their age.|`|aJjV5b95aa	I believe that the choice you have made to move on is the right choice and yes you find someone else that will accept your son and treat you the way you should be treated. Good Luck to you and your son.|`|8KWxpsPQaa	what about the child in this <br>  does the child hears all the arguements<br>  is it right on the child <br>  think you need to answer these question yourself <br>  what most important|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	wow. he sounds EXACTYLY like my ex. dump him! hes not worth it girl. i am so much happier now.. so is my son!|`|AA11356977	First I dont beleive that you never faught infornt of your baby. You need to stop lieing to yourself for your childs sake and end it with this man or you  will mess up your kid. Be stong and be by yourself. I ended it with my kids dad when they were 3 and 7. That was 7 years ago. Make sure and get child support you will need it. I did it so can you.I am with a wonderful guy now who I never fight with and treats me great! You are the only person in charge of how your life turns out so take chare and own it!

Now what broke it off? him being a cheater.<br>  <br>  ~Heir Music|`|AA10757358	I fell in love with my husband when I saw him coaching a little league game for 6 year old boys.  The game was over and a little boy came up to him and said coach did we win.  The coach knelt down to be eye to eye with the little boy and ask him if he had fun.  The little boy said yes he had a good time.  The coach said then you are a winner because we play to have fun.  I married the coach a year later.  I not only wanted to marry someone I could love but someone who would be a good father to our children.  We had two children a boy and a girl and he was always a great father to them.  If one of the children came to him and said I "I have a problem" he would always say "no you don't have a problem we have a problem and we will fix it."|`|eeHgm5hGaa	When the night they asked me out and said they really really liked me and i said sure you do *sarcasm* and they said yes i love you and i put that on my life|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	he talked a lot in class and his stories were interesting and  he lured me into liking him that way|`|l0opvMfGaa	its only onesided love b'cause my girlfriend has not yet say me i love u but i love her very much|`|765eZqh7aa	Me in my boyfriend are in a long distance relationship.

c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Well, you can't put love and important life events on a time schedule, so I guess its up to you to do some introspective thinking about your future with her.  I guess the quick answer to your question is no.  No it doesn't sound like you're ready to get married.  Note I didn't say she's not the lady for you, just that you sound like you're panicking and as a result finding things wrong with her ;)  So maybe its not the right time yet for you.  As for whether she's the right woman, well, I can't answer that for you, but you can.  Does she make you happy and feel whole and complete?  Can you imagine a future with her?  Are you happy in that future you're imagining?  I'll check back later to see if you type more... I'm not sure if you are done or adding more or not|`|I0g24Jmkaa	you answered your own question.
Wt3t6rUPaa	No...well it depends.  Generally girls mature earlier than guys.  It is very common for guys to be a bit older than their girlfriends.

Its more important how you connect and get along.|`|YrjxCFXAaa	yes they would. just be careful.|`|XasLRQnXaa	i am 19 but i would still consider going out with a 18 year old if i was 20.

LOtStdFraa	it depends.<br>  since you guys are good friends, she might just think of you as a brother or something like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  okay since she said you were her brother...then that is not good. But girls do sometimes date their close friends. I had a best friend and we dated.
QJT5JXf2aa	I haven't been married for twenty five years (I'm only 21), but I've been married for five wonderful years, and I can promise you that I will be with him until the day he, or I, passes on. In my opinion, being married for 25 years with children is far from a yardstick for success. <br>  <br>  I know a couple who's been married for 27 years, has three beautiful kids, and to the outside world, everything's peachy. Secretly, the woman has confessed she has never been in love with her husband. So, 25 years and children is not a yardstick for success, and no-matter-what, the same rules apply to any happy marriage, amount of time be damned.<br>  <br>  Now, let me pre-face this by saying we're NOT married legally. I'm anti-legal marriage for personal reasons but we had a personal ceremony with family and friends and have never considered ourselves any less married than anyone else.<br>  <br>  Secondly, let me note that while I was 16 when we married, we'd been friends several years, he was a very close friend of the family, and I was very mature for my age. So, let's leave age out of this. And get to the nitty gritty.<br>  <br>  Our first three years were our worst. The first year, to be honest, was a nightmare. My depression was eating me alive worse and worse every day, my doctor was finally narrowing down exactly what was wrong with me (but not fixing it), and the list of things wrong with me were piling up. The disorders that are now slowly cripling me were just starting, and here we are as newlyweds trying to make a life together and here we are facing things like a 95% probability that I'll never be able to bear our children, the possiblity that by the time I'm 25, I'll be wheelchair bound, etc. It was NOT a good way to start a life together.<br>  <br>  But this is also what made all the difference in our marriage and leads to the secret of why every single day, I fall more in love with this man. Why I believe we'll be together forever --- we've grown together, instead of apart.  <br>  <br>  The keys to any happy marriage are communication, mutual experiences, honesty, trust, and unconditional love.<br>  <br>  Let's start with unconditional love, because it's a biggie. <br>  <br>  When someone smiles at you, and it doesn't mean "I'm happy to see you" to you, that's a GOOD thing. When that smile says "You're the reason I breathe", that's when you've got it made. A long time ago, a friend quoted this to me, and I think it's one of the most awesome quotes for any married couple:<br>  <br>  "It's easy to die for the one you love. What is hard, is living for them."<br>  <br>  A lot of people freak, thinking this means you have to spend every waking moment revolving around this person, but that's completely absurd. To live for someone is not to make them your world, but to make them a part of yours. To keep going when it gets tough because you know it's worth it to see their smile again. To go the extra mile, even when you want to just fall over, because it'll make them feel special. I believe that is the essence of true, unconditional love. When you can love someone enough that you would give of yourself freely and openly, forgive them when they may not deserve it, hold them when they've just been a complete and total jerk, etc. No marriage is perfect, but that unconditional love thing can really, REALLY do wonders for it. <br>  <br>  Another one is serious communication. I know people who say they communicate with their partners, and then turn around and tell me how they can't talk about a certain issue with their partner because "What if he leaves me!" or "He just won't understand."<br>  <br>  Um, in that case, you really shouldn't be with that person. <br>  <br>  True communication is TRUSTING your partner to listen with an open heart to what you have to say. They may be hurt, they may not agree, but you are trusting that they will at least try to understand for your sake. The other side of that communication is being able to do just that --- trying to understand, no matter how hard it may be.<br>  <br>  That's also where trust comes in. To be honest, trusting your partner not to shag someone isn't NEARLY as hard as trusting them not to freak about your darkest secret, or to understand that maybe you want an open relationship. they may not be willing to give you that, but trusting them enough to share those feelings is a big deal.<br>  <br>  As for mutual experiences -- I don't mean having very similar lives, I mean sharing in the things that interest your partner but may not interest you, and sharing those things together and growing together as a couple instead of individual people. Mutual experience can also be facing adversity together as a couple, instead of each person going it alone. oddly enough, hard times are GOOD for a relationship in the long run.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long post! Hope I could help.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	I've been with my husband for 18 years (I think that is sufficient to comment) and we are up to our last of the cycles. I wish I could remember the website that talks about marriages and cycles...basically it says work through all the stages of a marriage and you will live a happy life. Those that stay together (so long as their is no abusive) will be rewarded with peace and happiness...<br>  <br>  We have been through all the cycles and I believe we are on our last, he is turning 40 this year and has hit his mid life crisis - lets ride this out and hopefully my loving husband will be back<br>  <br>  I dont give up on him because of small issues and he just never seems to complain about me (I always try to anticipate his needs and adjust so that he is as happy as I can make him)<br>  <br>  Anyone that asks this question is bound to find happiness either in marriage, defacto, long term boyfriend whatever so long as you find someone that also wants what you want (in terms of a successful long term partnership)|`|yVIb7zjiaa	Yes I married my HS sweetheart I was 16 and he was19 we got married when I was 19 and yes we are still married 25 yrs this Oct 6,2009 Alot of people tried to stop us from getting married saying it wouldn't last we are  to young.Well I love it when I see those same people who are divorced now and I'm still married ,Marriage is hard work it is not a game..I feel the glue to my marriage is communication always communicate with your spouse good or bad .Treat  your spouse how  you would want to be treated sometime put yourself in the other person shoes..And we have 3 kids  23,21&19  Good Luck to you..|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	My granddad told me marriage is NOT a 50 - 50 proposition. It's 100 - 100.<br>  If you both give 100%. Then when things get tough you have something in the "emotional bank" to draw on.<br>  Never go to sleep angry at each other. I've followed his advice.. in fact we don't have a SINGLE divorce (yet) in our family.<br>  I'm in my 50's<br>  My grandparents married at age 30 and were married over 60 years!!!|`|AA11356977	Doing nice things each day for eachother and not trying to change the others point of view. We dont fight!|`|5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	all well i am 12 years in. but i will tell you anyway. Do not be jelous <br>  be trusting do not be mad for a long time talk about your problems if you argue argue then afterwards when it is done leave it be done do not brign it up again. do not go to bed mad. if you have not resolved the matter forgive then talk about it in the morning but do not go to bed mad at each other. do converstations if nothing to talk about just talk about little things like work and things. If not jus spend time together watching tv. Go out on dates not all the time but once in awile just the two of you. MAKE sure you get your adult time not really sex but just you time without the children if they sleep in the bed after they go to sleep put them somewhere else you got to have your time. the most thing is being honest with each other and trusting each other. KNOWing that you can tell him/her anything is the best thing in the world. I can tell my husband anything. i talk to him about anything. that is a wonderfull thing. to have. having faith in God can really help too.  compermising and make dessions together and not because you have to but say hey i am going so and so do you mind? if you want to go by yourself sometimes they may mind if so dont go. if not then go just be nice and if late comeing home call. <br>  well i know i am not in your years prefrence but i hope i helped.|`|HUlK3soAaa	Since I've only been married 8.5 years, I'll go with what my husband's grandparents told us on our wedding day.  Next month, they will be celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary. <br>  <br>  Remember:  "I love you."  "I'm sorry."  "Thank you."<br>  <br>  They've also said that it helps to marry your best friend.  You should not only be in love with the person you marry, but also like them as well.|`|dvevk1qbaa	i would have answered this question a month ago.

So hit your wife. Hit her very hard every time she gets out of line. If you are the only person making decisions, and the only one with expressed feelings and wants and desires, things become SO SIMPLE. It's basically just steak dinners and blowjays there on out. Enjoy!|`|AA10420452	well we have been married for 26+ now.i would say trust and forgiveness<br>  is 2 of the main ones and a good open communication.and last is you must have a good sex life.with out that one would end up straying. giving 110% is a must.nothing in life worth having is easy.a good marriage takes a lot of hard work.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	Humor.

PSQvGW4Uaa	Figure out what his interests are and base your conversations off that.  Really, you can't 'make' anyone more interested in you. You can only talk to them, and if they enjoy your company and chemistry, that's what will make them like you.|`|WC2bTHkKaa	Omg can you PLEASE tell me the answer to this question once you get a good one! I have the same problem!|`|taMnlOaFaa	Making a guy chase you is always the best way to go...have a short conversation with him where you're blatanly flirting with him but only for a few minutes and then walk away. This will definitely get him interested...you'll leave him curious and wanting more. Then let him contact you.  <br>  "Don’t get tricked into asking him out. If he likes you, he’ll do the asking."|`|lj3hNR9baa	Show a bit more skin. I don't mean whore out but I'm sure you've got some good features, make them noticeable. Also flirt with him.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Children don't view life this way.  They have both MOTHERS and FATHERS.   The money goes from their father to their mother and this means she is rearing them.  The money benefits them.  The money wasn't solely their father's, or the court wouldn't have given it to their mother.<br>  <br>  I can tell you what my 45 year old bf thinks about the way his father treated his mother during and after the divorce, however:  He finally had to cut ties with the man to get over it.<br>  <br>  It didn't keep him from getting married and he was for 10 years.  He even wants to do it again.  His motivation in life is to be nothing like his father.|`|pOCabUMvaa	Cassius, actually it was my mom that got taken for everything, and I knew their live was different than mine and I knew that my life, when I got married would be nothing like theirs, I learned from their experience and their divorce that when I got marriedd, things would be different.<br>  <br>  I would not let my marriage be like theirs, the way it affected my sister and me to see my "father" literally take everything from my mom and make her suffer, no way!!<br>  <br>  I ended up moving out of his house and living with my mom after their divorce, he was so mean and cruel, and I hated the way he always talked about my mom, who loved us with all of her heart and soul.<br>  <br>  I have been married for 17 years now, and I have learned my life 101 experiences to not have the kind of marriage my parents did.<br>  <br>  Their marriage was never meant to be, mine was.<br>  <br>  I am not saying my marriage is perfect, but we love each-other so much, we are willing to make it work and overcome any obstacle that comes our way.<br>  <br>  Something my father never did.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	My father didn't lose his money. My mom, sister, and I got to stay in the house until I was 18 (I was the youngest), then they either had to sell it, or my mom had to buy him out at fair market value. She ended up buying him out when I was 12, when she got remarried. <br>  He did have to pay child support for 4 years, then I moved in with him when I was 13.<br>  Their divorce was pretty civil as far as divorces go....|`|09k5GLLkaa	You don't let anyone including your parents influence your life.

AA11566287	You can't change someone else, they have to want to change themselves.  It sounds like he's just trying to manipulate you when you're out having fun w/out him.

Don't give too much notice in these things if you really care about him. He'll get the signal and stop doing this. It happens because of insecurity. If you love him very much then try to change him by avoiding this, otherwise just go on as long as it feels good to you, and then find a new one. :D<br>  <br>  I was like this, but talking with my gf about this really helped, and besides, i love her a lot so it wouldn't matter as long as he's serious with you.

You have no business partying. Plain and simple. A a party girl is a girl looking for either a man, or a sex partner. You would not have lasted beyond the first party with a decent guy. And in the future, write your questions in English. You might think it is cute or funny, but the fact is, it shows immaturity. <br>  If I were this guy, I would dump you like a hot potato. Ouch! You need to grow up. Sorry to be so harsh, but you need a reality check.
gC98RlU3aa	how about talking to girls in ur classes or close to ur dorm/ apt. instead of random ppl. I'm in college to and i would honestly say about a 6. if a girl saw u open up to her,find things u guys have in common, begin with a friendship, getting to know each other, then see if it'll become a romantic relationship. Looks aren't Everything in a relationship-just the 1st impression, if u approch someone and make the 1st step in starting a convo w/ a girl, then she'll have more than just that "1st impression."|`|qMnuRO50aa	Coming from a guy, I'd say you could be more than a five... if you smiled.<br>  Smiling is key. Smiling makes you more approachable.<br>  <br>  My advice... join some more clubs. Walking up to random people will probably not cut it.

I used to ALWAYS have my ex stay on the phone with me until eventually he told me he didn't like to do it.  I just laughed and never made him do it again.  If she loves you she should understand.  Make a deal with her, you'll call her everyday but no more hour long phone calls maybe 15 minutes or 30.  Good luck!|`|z0vylug1aa	i had a boyfriend, and we just could never get transportation to each others houses, so we would call each other at night, we stayed on the phone til we fell alsleep, and when we woke up for school the next morring we would still be on the phone. we went to different schools, it worked out for 5 months.(:<br>  <br>  Go unlimited!!!!|`|51441Us8aa	Date older girls.

She doesn't wanna feel like her bf is bored talking to her!<br>  Be super sweet to her the next time you talk to her on the phone and make her happy by saying sorry about what happened and sweetly tell her you are tired and you're going to bed and say you miss her and love her. You just have to make her feel loved and missed as much as she misses and loves you, but you happen to be tired. This would make me understand and not feel hurt if my bf did it.|`|0RbhykJiaa	Just tell her how you feel. Honesty is really important. But if she can't put up with that.. She's crazy.. hahaha

Hope the party goes well :P<br>  x|`|pffMhrPeaa	yea he likes u a little |`|xJZSpsRhaa	yes, flirting is a key sign
VEEgoDkFaa	It sounds like you have a very guilty conscious that you desperately want to alleviate but the key word is desperate. You might need to just move away from the situation and let time take it's course. Other than to apologize for what you did, there's not too much else you can do. Trying too hard can only make things worse and then you will feel even more guilt. Sometimes we have to let things go even when we were wrong. As for your ex, that's a situation you definitely need let go. You did what you could and if it hasn't helped you might need to recognize that there's nothing you can do. It's a hard thing for you to accept, but once you do, you can move on and begin to feel better. Trust. ';-)|`|JerBNr3Zaa	Yes, you can't expect to fix it all when you hurt people. What happened happened and you can't change that. You're gonna have to live with that I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  You do need to apologise to all the people you've hurt and tell them that you're aware of what you did and that you now know that it's wrong.<br>  <br>  You can't expect these people to forgive you, so you can't fix things.<br>  <br>  specially when you're going around like a mad woman to try to fix things, that will only make things worse.<br>  <br>  Apologise and leave these people alone. The damage is done so live with it. You might be lucky and some of your friends will forgive you and see that you are genuine and learned your lesson.|`|4xWk7tcuaa	sounds like you have your work cut out for you. its an un-hill battle but if it will bring you peace of mind to know that he knows your sorry for cheating on him, then go for it. otherwise, id leave it where it is, in the past. good luck 
f7e58cfa625abc1ee79161b6bce00e00aa	yeah, don't do it.... you don't know this person. isn't marriage about love not money?!?!?!|`|AA11804436	]:~~~~~~~~~p|`|AA10282372	Nothing to say except Best of Luck.
ZfeSyoKXaa	You got to be somewhat attracted to your partner that's just nature,but personality is a huge part what good are looks when you have nothing else to go with it,and personality can make a less a attractive person look more...You can't judge all women by a few you and your a cousin talked to....And what men don't pick women just on looks?? lol...I do find my guy attractive but his personality and maturity makes him much more hotter in my opinion...|`|ADP9swbMaa	Well...yeah! No one wants to date someone they don't find attractive. And some people, usually younger high school aged people, are willing to date someone who isn't all that great of a person if they are attractive. <br>  Don't pretend guys don't do it too. It's human nature.|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	you all act the same.<br>  when you grow up and all become mature,<br>  then you will understand the real foundation for a relationship.|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	No offense but your just being plain rude. You can't judge all girls, on other girls actions. Thats like us girls calling all guys dick heads because our ex-bf acted like one. We're not all the same. We do believe that peronsality is more important than looks, but in the long term we would never stay with the good looking rude guy. Besides you do actually have to be attracted to the guy physically as well as personality wise. And if a girl does think that looks are more important than personality, than they are just immature.<br>  And I'm sure that if you turned the situation around, all guys would choose a hot girl over a nice funny (but not great looking) girl.|`|QmG2v1quaa	You can sit there and say that girls are selfish all you want, but why don't you turn that "test" around and she how many guys would choose a fun girl over a hot girl. I think you'll realize that guys are the same way!!<br>  <br>  And anyways, anyone who says that personality is more important than looks is stupid and lying to themselves. The first thing you are attracted to in a person is their looks. That's it!! Once the initial attraction is there, it's the personality that keeps you in the relationship. So yeah, looks are important to EVERYONE!! But it's the personality that keeps you interested. <br>  <br>  And you're right, it's not a maturity thing, it's just a way of life!!|`|tXYyqA5daa	Maturity has everything to do with this. Any girl who goes for looks over personality is an immature idiot. I feel sorry for you if those are the kind of girls you are around. Every girl has a "type", you know, eye color, hair length, etc. They usually fall for guys who have that, but I've seen girls fall for guys that are totally not their type, and they find his personality interesting. This happened to a friend of mine. If the kind of girls you hang out with are such idiots that they can't see a good guy when he's around, then you need to find new girls to hang around.<br>  <br>  I'd also like to add, 20 people is not a study. Technically a study should involve 100 or more, depending on how many girls you have at your school.|`|DS1P6NsSaa	nooo.personality comes first...but looks r next..<br>  <br>  i dont want to wake up and see a boy with a dogs butt for a face...so yeah...<br>  personality, then looks

I would get in touch with him.  It's possible that he made the decision to break up while he was under a lot of stress.  I would give him a call, but then wait for him to call the next time.  If he wants to work it out he will reach out to you and let you know.|`|7fYJQjjwaa	Sounds like a good response to me. It doesn't sound to pushy and still lets him know you care. Besides, he asked you to stay in touch. If you two really care about each other then you should stay in contact. I'm not sure breaking up was the best thing for you both, but if ya'll are meant to be then you will work it out. You two can still go out on a date even if you aren't boyfriend and girlfriend so you might suggest dinner or something so you can catch up...|`|II73zpozaa	GIRL i think you should really go for it.<br>  whats the worst that can happen? I think it sounds like  he's using reverse physology on you waiting for YOU to call him. Him saying he wants to take a break in gu lagnuage is like i dont want to date right now but i still want you to love me and be my girl.|`|RRWkrR3qaa	That is sweet. I would guess that he is having a hard time with his decision. Yes, I do think that you should send him a message. But, do not bring up that you heard the message to your brother. However, if he asks you if you heard it then, you should tell. Don't completely isolate yourself from the guy, as he may think that you were thinking of the decision that he made way before you were. Then again, don't come across too strong, because I think that this would send out the wrong message to him. <br>  I guess I would just say do whatever feels right, as this all comes down to whether or not the person was very sensitive. |`|Y0ELo5Rbaa	Send him a message. From what you said he told you, he still likes you, and still cares for you very much, just that there are things that need to be worked out before you two can officially be together. Just because you aren't dating doesn't mean you shouldn't talk to him. He still cares for you, and I'm sure he wants to know that you still care about him. Too many people out there hate someone the second they break up, and he doesn't want that to happen, it seems.  Send him a message.  =)|`|f3b291312c0ca402f95078e3ee2e8b3faa	Let it go. It sounds like he may be trying to see "if you really care" you'll come running to his arms. Too much drama. Let him have it his way, it doesn't mean you have to not care. Just give him his space, work out what you need to work out so you can be with him fully and completely, Him hurting does not change the reason he broke it off. You have to fix that first, if you're willing too, and then contact him. I would assume he is just being friendly with your brother and even though he may not want to be apart from you he is being adult enough to realize it wont work the way it is now. You should give him some credit for that. Talking to your brother gives him a sense of closeness to you but allows him to keep his decision. |`|x0ALX3UCaa	You've been with him for 9 months, that's long enough to know whether its crying or stuffy nose. If he was crying send him a message and say hey do you want to get some coffee or something? Go out together and have a nice date chances are something will come up that will pop the question if either one of you are having a hard time. Tell the truth and in time it piece itself together. Remember only tell him how you feel if the question pops up if you bring it up an not let it just come up it will seem like your pressuring him.. have a good time with him as many times as it takes to get him back.|`|yt3vXQkIaa	I think you should send him a text but one a little more short and to the point. Tell him what you've just told us. You miss him, love him, But you would respect his wishes. Sometimes we say things out of angrier or hurt. He may have had time to sleep on it and realize that he made a mistake. If your upfront with him you lay it on the line if he really wants to be with you he will. If not you let him know you will respect his feeling and leave it alone.|`|ks2oieV0aa	Aw, send it!  xox|`|kvcIdORcaa	Eh... If you miss him and want to get back, just cut to the chase and tell him. Otherwise stop playing the coy games and cut him off for good.|`|oqX0PwQiaa	He broke it off. Don't make the first contact with him. If he doesn't call you for a week or so then you just might as well move on.|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	Hey girlie ... okay ... here is what i think!  It sounds like there is still some feelings between you two (obviously) ... and you had a good relationship!  It hasn't been that long since the breakup so everything is still fresh.  If you guys are friends you could always text him and say something like this ... "Hey how are you doing? I've been thinking about you and my brother said you called him and sounded upset, is something wrong?" ... you never want to text too much or call repeatedly and be crazy about it ... but it sounds like you're not the crazy type and if he was your boyfriend for 9 months he should know that too!  Give him and ring (or text) and see where that goes ... then try to lay low for a couple of days ... see if he calls you!  GOOD LUCK!  Relationships can be really tricky!  I hope that everything works out for you :)|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	Does he contact your brother often?  If he doesn't it's a good possibility he's trying to find a way to still connect to you.  Hope that makes sense.  He obviously still cares a lot about you.  I think you should send the message.  What do you have to loose?  Maybe after a little time the two of you can talk about things and see if maybe you can give you two another try.  Letting him know you are still there for him and and still care is a wonderful thing.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|w3MziozHaa	As long as you keep the conversation casual and don't talk about the relationship, it should be alright for you to call him. Just listen to him and be as supportive as you can to each other.|`|bdIXXUPvaa	i think u should just put hey i havent talk to u in a while and wen he replys just put wat was up with the voice mail u left my brother |`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	well it depends.<br>  what are the issues that are going on in your life if you dont mind me asking.|`|3wq8DgxWaa	it sounds like he still likes you mabey you should call him and talk for awhile i mean nobody should have to go throught life just to say i wonder what would have happend if i did call him you should just plain out ask him if he stills have feelings for you and im sure he does but it sounds like you are a careing considerate person and every guy is looking for some lke you ..good luck!! |`|B4Bu4s0Qaa	I think you should send it, he obviously misses you  and maybe the call to your brother was just a i want to still be your friend.. but if you send it then whats the harm i mean if he misses you he'll reply but if he doesn't then you know he is really over you..and then you need to find someone that wants to be there for you!|`|CitsGk8Gaa	say "hey, it feels weird not talking to you or hanging out anymore. i understand what we talked about on sunday, but i was just thinking about you and wondering how you're doing. if you want to talk, i'm here."<br>  let him know you still care about him, but don't freak him out.|`|V0uYKQskaa	It sounds like he wants to keep you there just in case. This is not right what he is doing. He either needs to break it off clean and no contact or you both need to work on making things better. What could be so bad that you did or doing that would cause him to do this? <br>  <br>  I do suggest you send him a message and tell him it isn't fair of him to string you along like this and keep giving you hope. He needs to make up his mind. In the meantime do not contact him. He sounds wishy washy and immature. |`|hChy7BAPaa	send that message! you love him! and i'm sure he'll appreciate it. u might want to add that ur bro told u that he said hi for you and that u got the message so ur just sayin hello|`|nQqQga4naa	I personally think you should hold off since the break up was so recent.  He didn't know your bro was going to let you listen to that message, so it might have been nothing.  If he is that upset he will give you a call eventually and he probably is upset didn't seem like either one of you really wanted to end it.  I would give it some time, he will contact you if he wants to talk about the situation.  I understand that you miss him and he probably feels the same way.  Remember distance makes the heart grow fonder!
4efJ1tBRaa	Realmente nao é fácil... Ja passei por isso e digo que se for um grande amor voce ainda vai pensar nele por muito tempo, o jeito é sair com as amigas, se ocupar, fazer coisas que voce sempre quis e nunca teve tempo como aulas de algum tipo esporte. E se quiser esquecer de vez é melhor nao manter contato senao a pessoa vai ficar na sua cabe?a o dia todo. Alguns dias depois voce vai ficar super bem e em outros dias voce vai ter uma recaida o que é normal, e quando tiver recaida ligar para alguem e conversar muito e só com o tempo voce verá que passa.

Isso é um processo de desatar la?os QUíMICOS e AFETIVOS, esses la?os só acabam quando os horm?nios que nos fazem sentir t?o "al-ma gêmea" também acabam, isso leva de 2 a 4 anos, mas sempre acabam e os la?os afetivos, que demoram mais, mas também acabam. Encontrar um outro namorado, sem for?ar a barra, de leve, ajuda. Ele vai fazer o mesmo, quer você queira ou n?o, quer você saiba ou n?o. é a natureza.

jxxXTEG4aa	Olha, 7 anos s?o mais do que suficientes para se conhecer alguém sim. Mas essa regra também vale para você. Nesse tempo todo n?o conseguiu perceber que tipo de homem era esse cara? N?o notou se ele só pensava nele mesmo ou se respeitava você como mulher? Nesse tempo todo é muito importante você observar o caráter dele. Pelo que você está descrevendo, parece que se surpreendeu com o comportamento desse cara depois de tanto tempo. Concluo, desta forma, que você também n?o o conhecia muito bem. Sendo assim ele n?o enxerga o mal que te faz, mas você também n?o enxergou o caráter dele ao longo desse tempo.<br>  Se n?o está mais com ele, se ainda sofre, espere se sentir melhor e, quando estiver pronta para uma nova rela??o, seja mais observadora.

Megan Fox's altered photo in particular looks like a barbie.  They definitely don't look bad with the babydoll adjustments, but its hard for me to say if its an improvement or not since I'm used to seeing them as they already are.  It be interesting if you posted this again but with random people, not really famous celebrities and see what people think without the bias.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Personally, I think they are all beautiful. But I'm not a guy.

yWXHKUKRaa	That really sucks, and that would really get on my nerves, too, but there is totally a way that you can fix it by being the better of the two.  You should, in private, tell Isabella how you feel about her inviting Isabella instead of you, and ask her why she did it so that you can better understand.  If she did do it just to make you jealous, she'll probably feel guilty, but maybe if she has a good reason for it, you won't feel so pissed anymore.  Also, you should tell Madison G what Isabella wrote about her (maybe show her, if you have the paper?) and maybe she won't want to go with Isabella anymore when she realizes she's completely false.  Who knows.  That's probably the best you can do for now.  Hope you guys work it out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  -Gabrielaa :]|`|Uzd8ks0Paa	Yes true friends tell the truth to their friends. But they also don't talk about them and bad mouth them behind their backs either. You can't just talk about someone or "write about them" and then "take it back" whats done is done and whats said has already been said. There is no turning back time. Honestly it sounds to me like none of you are really good friends and you should all find a new group of friends. Either that or grow up and stop bashing each other behind each others backs.|`|QYbMxFE0aa	Sounds like you are the jealous one over the whole situation. I would not tell Madison because it would just make you look desperate and show to everyone else that you ARE jealous.. Just let it go. And about the statement "They are both the most ignorant bitchesssss I will ever know!!!"...... You need to stop being such a backstabber to your "friends" or you wont have any at all.. good luck |`|pdmw1Gcdaa	Yes, tell her the truth! But yeah, she did invite her just to make you mad and that's not a real friend there! Tell her the truth, but make sure to let her know that the only reason you're telling her is b/c you're a good friend and you care about her, not just to have her take you instead. |`|VWrYYfGTaa	can i have the tickets oh and ignore them dont act like a child anyone would know to IGNORE THEM!!!|`|ndykErvWaa	they don't sound like real friends ignore them for awhile |`|4Ihnw35Uaa	Let me guess....13??  12???|`|WHszC08Qaa	Every one needs encouragement and friends to help then when they are down.

This sounds like a typical middle school/high school issue with girls. Everybody goes through this. Just wait a little for them to mature. They will get over being mad at you and I'm sure you will get over it as well. In the meantime hang out with some other friends.|`|9yj86j0Caa	Doesn't sound like any of you know what the meaning of friendship is.  You all sound very immature to me.

(your boyfriend)<br>  If you think he's bringing it up alot, then he probably realised it too and that's probably why he brings it up mostly when he's drunk (because alchohol will make him a bit braver and he'll think what he wants to think kind of thing)<br>  If it's bothering you though and you don't feel confortable and ready to talk about it to your boyfriend, then you should explain this to your boyfriend and if he's a good boyfriend he will be understanding.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped x|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	if you are uncomfortable with it, you should tell him.|`|lFenXNCzaa	If you don't like it then ask him not to bring it up ever again.|`|3B1g8cVBaa	Tell him it weirds you out, he'll shut up.

Xj6XZR89aa	i think it depends on the girl, and the porn probably. a lot of us have watched it trough curiosity or to laugh at fake everything is and the terrible acting. there's a general consensus that girls need more emotional attachment to enjoy sex, i don't know if that's true or not. <br>  <br>  a lot of girls my self included read a lot of fanfiction, some of which is almost porn.|`|nV4hP0HOaa	Sometimes.

Hanging out with her in the middle of the week and then again on the weekend will let her know that you are interested in her but not being too clingy.

99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	New wife is just jealous.  It could be because you have all this history with him, and you don't.  Could be because she feels excluded by him (and you) when the two of you talk.  <br>  <br>  I would let him deal with her, and you just be friends.  Make sure you always ask about her.  Make sure you include her in any conversations.  Make sure you compliment her.  If you don't make it into a big deal, and go out of your way to acknowledge her, then at some point she'll get okay with it.<br>  <br>  Honestly, the best thing you can say to her are things like:  He's so lucky to have found you.   or  You know, I never thought he'd find someone as right for him as you are.|`|ETqZU5D9aa	I think she is just overreacting. Did this all of a sudden become a problem? Because if it did, and you say they're expecting, maybe it's just the hormones talking. I think you should have a one-on-one with her about it and explain everything to her that you just explained here. Good luck!|`|09k5GLLkaa	The trouble lies with the new wife feeling jealous just like you said. She feels threatened by you. maybe the two of you or even 3 of you counting your husband can convince her that it is only a friendship you two have and that you want to remain friends with your ex guy. Some people just can't handle this. I went through this a long time back and lost a very good friend since her b/f couldn't handle the friendship I had with my friend and his girlfriend. I backed off so she wouldn't catch hell from her b/f and I regret doing that to this day. We had a great friendship.|`|2pNHOCONaa	i have been asking this for quite a long time now as well. and based on my experiences? i know his wife is jealous. either from their lack of communication about the issue, or from her husband's part, where he probably sent subconscious signals to his wife that your ex still likes you somehow. it is possible that her husband do not even look at you that way anymore, but that she is just quite insecure with herself that she feels he could leave her anytime if circumstance allows that you ask him to. lol.. jealousy is a very underestimated motivation. whatever the reason, we need to respect what your ex feels.<br>  <br>  i am sure that if he loves his wife, if he truly loves her, and she is asking to specifically cut your communication with him, because it is very possible he has not yet shown her enough proof that he loves her above everyone else, which should be what every married person's priority is, then he needs to do this. and you need to let him go. it isnt really about you losing a friend, its about you being the best possible friend you could be for your ex, that if this is what will make him happy, if this is what will make him grow spiritually, then you will respect his decision. besides, its not just his wife's, if it pushes through, he obviously said yes as well. <br>  <br>  im married too. and i do keep in touch with my ex's, but the point is, if at any point in our relationship with my husband that he feels uncomfortable seeing me talk to my ex? in an instant i would tell my ex that i cant be friends with them anymore. not even to contact them when someone dies, or someone gets married, or even just on their birthday. if i love my husband at all, and i know this will worry him the slightest bit? it will be that easy for me to give up anything for him. because i know he would do the same for me. and i want us to give each other more reason to trust each other. if my ex's cant respect that? then theyre not really worth being my friend's now are they? :) <br>  <br>  but thats me. anyway, good luck to you!! <br>  <br>  happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. -Gandhi<br>  <br>  strive to be happy stranger :)|`|ccmax0yQaa	ya it is ok|`|OeLmW4Leaa	put yourself in your position, she probably feels threatened by what you and him have. even though it happened 20 years ago, or so... situations like this can still make people uncomfortable. it would be hard of her to make him cut you off completely, i would suggest rather than this- try make an effort to envolve her, get to know her- so she can see that you are not a predator! im sure that if she got to know you, she would be able to put up with ytou every few months when you see each other!|`|QK1jfKG9aa	Hell yeah, you are two diff. people now, and although that can be a turn on bcoz of the curiosity that both of you already have, its still ok if you both know you can never imagine the other to be more than friend. Women hate ex girlfriends, specially ones that their husband have been with when he was young, thats a threat bcoz it means way back then you probably had a wild young relationship, and he husband being friends with you will remind him of that.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	It's cool! Now if your husband feels uncomfortable about it, then you should stop.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I think that is unreasonable as well.<br>  <br>  When I read your title, I was going to disagree with you, however after reading your additional details I think she's being rididulous.<br>  <br>  Here is the thing.  My husband and I do NOT believe friends of the opposite sex are okay when you're married.  We ESPECIALLY find it inappropriate to talk to exs, and therefore we do not have close personal relationships with members of the opposite sex.  However, in your situation I think it's different.  You only see him once in awhile for special occasions, and you hardly talk to him -- what's the big deal?  I could understand his wife having an issue if you two talked on the phone all the time, or were going out together alone, because I would personally have an issue with that myself.  However, for her to have an issue with you two seeing each other IN PUBLIC AROUND OTHER PEOPLE, and only on special occasions I really think is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  I think her issue may be she thinks she has some reason to not trust him, so she's taking it out on this situation.  You don't know their private life -- there may be a possibility he's lied to her or done something unfavorable so she thinks she can't trust him with any other women, in public or private.  <br>  <br>  I think this question is pretty irrelevant though, because even though you've known him for 20 years, you're just a friend, this other woman is his WIFE.  You're married yourself, so you understand the sanctity of a marriage.  If he needs to cut you out of his life in order to keep peace and happiness in his marriage he's going to do it whether you like it or not, unfortunately.  That doesn't make it right, but it is what it is.  Just let it be and hope that he contacts you in the future.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|C3cH7RALaa	if u r talking n looking abt love things to her then just simply explore ur heart to her........becaz love is free n holy from religion color race n physical attraction....<br>  just listen her words in a calm way after u finish ur words to her<br>  n what she tells u just accept them...........<br>  if accept u its ur gr8 day<br>  if not then just accept her as friend n be  agood friend 4 all life putting jealous n sex things away from ur mind forever.AND MAkE IT GR8 WAY<br>  good luck|`|OzWvcOQnaa	just tell her how you feel<br>  and that if she will give you a chance<br>  ask her out to the movies or something<br>  say it nicely and sweet<br>  if shes nice she will say yes|`|FBSOBz0zaa	1) Go up to her<br>  2)Just ask her out xD

Whether it be one or two bestfriends or lots of close ones. They all come and go, it's life. but the ones worth keeping are those who will remember and HELP you. Or even put up with good and bad situations. Don't keep those who are "sunshine" friends. Just be a good friend and you'll have that in return.|`|sriByWZBaa	Well, thats why you need to keep in touch! Friends can be the greatest thing, especially great ones! They will never leave you. Friends do come and go, but you contact them and visit each other. But you meet some new friends and sometimes, they can be even greater than the last one! just keep in contact! Being alone and keeping thoughts to yourself makes you feel even more lost and lonelier than ever.

K4Q3eirFaa	Honestly , if you have to ask strangers , he's probably not that into you.

FSNvkCL8aa	well what i think. your the back up dude... as in if he fails going out whit the other girl he is going to try to come for you. So be careful yo..|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	I would think so.<br>  <br>  answer mine! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqwR_vN29OR3h9v3er5pkKXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306223006AAaXzst">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|G1IncUnfaa	Believe me I had this problem.

You will want to catch her attention FIRST. Then drop the hints. <br>      Go for the subtle ones at first. "Enchanted by her" or "missing her" will get the girl's attention. It's human nature for women to hate us being over them and to get off on the idea that they've got a hold on us. <br>  <br>  <br>     Next try something more strong but unspecific.  like "Miss her terribly" or "Thinking of her all the time"  This will cement her attention, and get her waiting for more, hoping to hear about herself. <br>  <br>     Then drop the "over her" bomb with something like: "loving the irony fate shows by opening a new book for me."  or "- hope this gal don't turn out like the last" or something more general but carefree like "I just found the silver lining the the lame old raincloud!" Ya get the idea. Either suggesting that there's another gal, or simply showing a life thats JUST FINE without her. <br>  <br>       but it's CRITICAL you DON'T DON'T DON'T talk to the ex during this time. Especially if you'v done so in the past. keep your life a mystery, and she'll get curious. THEN you'll get a view on how she stands emotionally where you're concerned.|`|ojtc54Iwaa	*****?

AA11865280	If she is consistently saying no to you and not even offering an alternative day to go out with you then it could be an indication of a lack of genuine interest in going out with you. Don't wait around for her and I think the resolution to the issue is this; don't play cat and mouse with her and also let her call you. If she doesn't then so be it.|`|C3cH7RALaa	net is the world of everything u wana need in ur life.........whatever u r not getting in life.........<br>  net life just like a mirage of ur dreams.<br>  so try to find difference from ur conversion to her ALL IS IN JJST NET OR IT IS GOING IN REAL.<br>  if this is a long distance matter......between u n her .......forget n have peace of mind|`|GokA3YGkaa	Maybe... hard to see..<br>  <br>  depends on how long it plays out that she doesn't meet up with yyou because of being busy doing other things<br>  <br>  try planning something in advance, so there's time for it|`|ob9oJpKbaa	Just wait until she asks you- she will!|`|JC7If6Naaa	wait maybe shes really busy|`|ge5x9NHxaa	You should try to define the relationship with her and wait and see how she will reply you.  Then you decide whether to wait or to move on.  If she does not come out clear then move on.  May be sometime is keep her busy.

eqQXqipnaa	Continue being honest about the situation, your decision, and what you saw the outcomes to be.  appeal with your grades saying that you truly are trying your best this time around, and ask them point blank what they would have done, or how you could have made a better decision in this situation.   it will be very hard to continue being mad at you when you approach them asking for advice and telling them that you have put out 110% with no intentions of faltering or changing your level of effort.  you just knew that it would be better to turn it in late then not finished.|`|tZyfRRpWaa	   Just tell them your find it a bit difficult lately but you'll still do your best no matter what..   you need to enjoy being young too like so still make sure you have time for going out wiv mates and stuff..|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	Do your homework.|`|AA10370797	you should do what you suppose to do because your parents wants you do the best as you can so you can be a smart girl! and when you go college, be very careful because if you fail any of these classes, you might get suspended for one year from college. it happened to me! so i learn my lesson! yeah of course that my parents run their mouth about me on this and that. but i have to accept the fact that i did a very bad mistake and i must remember not to do it again ever. so you have to be very serious, motivated and be very smart than everyone else because you have to do it for yourself to become a successful student! and i know you wanna make that big money when you finish college, don't you? you should make yourself proud and make your parents proud! and when you finish college, getting ready to be a wife and have kids, and all of that, you should make everybody to be proud of you because i know you can do it!<br>  <br>  OK, I hope this helps!|`|Ouhzs81kaa	You need to get off YA and finish your paper. When they return present your paper to them and tell them you know you should of been able to finish it before today, but couldn't.  Tell them you thought you should be honest with them instead of lying to them. Tell them you will try to do better and then actually try to do better. In college they do not care if you are sick or not if a paper is due it is due, So if you can not get that straight then no sense in going to college and wasting the money. |`|aOL8B77laa	your still in your first year of high school. you've still got more years<br>  think about it this way. this won't matter in the future. just as long as you have good grades they shouldn't bug you about it much.<br>  <br>  if they still do, don't let them get inside your head. you are doing it for yourself. if they do, you'll start to become unmotivated and your grades will start going down.<br>  <br>  your still in you first year. you'll be okay.|`|AA11431279	ok, well first, you did the right thing, telling the truth.  second, its one essay, and unless if its a huge chunk of your grade, Its ok to not do well for one single essay, its not gonna bring your old ways back.  Just tell your parents that your an A student for almost all of your classes.  And maybe, talk to your teacher/s, a good relationship with your teacher can actually help you achieve the class becuase you can then feel free to ask for help whenever.|`|ApaTnAYraa	I would of done the same. If the essay can still be turned in, then what's the big deal? Yeah, you should of done it before it is due, but you're being responsible by trying to complete it.

They have your best interests at heart and what they are really trying to say is that they know you have the potential to get A's (which you have proved yourself by being an over achiever this year) and they want you to be on track for your own sake.<br>  You also did the right thing when you decided not to lie- this shows you have good character. But you could have gone to school and asked your teacher for an extension, and at the same time tried to figure out the real reason for the delay and made sure you become a responsible person that you can be.<br>  Trust me, both you and your parents will be happy with the outcome a few years down the road :))<br>  |`|dhOJKz69aa	well your parents love you so much that's why they want that you should get that scholarship.they want that you should be a clever so that you will have a bright career.just think my friend if you got scholarship what is their benefit in that?you know, our parents loves us more than themselves but sometimes they fails to show that or the way they show is become wrong in our point of view, which creates misunderstanding.<br>  so rather than thinking that why they are doing this to me just try to do your best so that nobody can point out your mistakes.<br>  Just Be Cool, Perfect & Always Try That You Never Be A Liar With Our Parents because there is no one in the world who loves you greater than your parents........................!   
vejBlTO5aa	For sure. I think its the greatest. My 16 yr old daughter - prob more important to your opinion :-) - likes this kind of guy as well. Most girls deep down want a man who will treat her like a queen, but you may have to wait until you can find someone who knows that she deserves that too. Many girls simply aren't used to being treated that way. Don't change. Do be sure that any complement you make, however, are genuine. Us women can tell the difference.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	Well maybe you try too hard? Also, you're 15, so I don't get why you consider them "women". But, other than that, I don't think anything is wrong with you just from that description. And short guys snobby? Nahh I've never heard that stereotype before.<br>  EDIT: Alright I change my mind. You are snobby AND insecure. There. You win.|`|6o6Ao1Paaa	Don't change of course. Women likes gentleman.|`|y2ZTzfWHaa	Gentlemen are definitely still appreciated.  The thing is, you're nice to all your friends who are girls, so they all see you as a good friend.  You have to be treat the one you want to date a little more special than the rest.  Otherwise, she'll just think you aren't interested in her in particular, you're just being nice because you're nice to everyone.|`|41S75G5Eaa	are you serious!?!<br>  dont change!!<br>  there are so few decent guys like you at my school!<br>  honestly i love it when a guy is a gentlemen<br>  if you act like an ***, chances are you're not gonna find a decent lady|`|ise05jjUaa	Yes gentlemen are appreciated by many women after they finally realize that those bad boys they've been going after all along will never change.  That's the sad thing about it, there are many good men out there, but because they're name tag doesn't say "bad boy," or they're not extremely handsome with a six pack they usually never get noticed.  Stay the way you are, hopefully one day a girl who's deserving of your presence will appreciate that.  There were many good men at one time, till they got screwed over royally.  Just don't change, I tried not to but man all the things I went through & being screwed over twice, its hard not to change.  Hopefully being a gentleman will pay off for you in the long run.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	Don't change. In the long run, being a gentleman will pay off.<br>  If you're not getting attention over it, then chances are, those girls aren't worth it, they don't know what they're missing!<br>  If you come off as too friendly for them, try being a gentleman but hint, or flirt at the same time, let them know you're interested.|`|fG50fL91aa	definatley dont change! girls like it and notice when guys do stuff like that, even if we pretend not to. keep up the good work and someone will notice soon enough|`|EatzEjhiaa	wow. you sound like a young me. I was 5'2' at 15. 5'5' when i graduated high school. 5'9' now. And 'just a friend' to sooo many girls. even now I see a lot of girls that are attracted to the guys that treat them like ****, but trust me, those are not girls you'd be interested in a real relationship with; they have lots of issues. There's some good ones out there though. My only advice, don't be such a gentleman that you don't ask out a girl you like, or don't let her know you'd like to kiss her. Some of them may want you to, but they think you see them as just a friend also. <br>  Additional Details:<br>  yeah there is that napolean complex thing, but that's just a few short guys. and I have several friends under 5'6' that are married to taller women who don't like guys to treat them bad. :)
LOtStdFraa	I prefer the guy to be taller than me.
71VRvldJaa	A "relationship" involves commitment.  He doesn't want that!  He's got all the perks and benefits of a relationship now without the commitment so he's free to walk at any time.  I think you're very right!  He's enjoying this semi free ride.  <br>  You've already been hurt once.....I'd be very cautious about how much emotional investment you put into this "non relationship" or you're going to end up hurt again.  Personally, I'd want to know the commitment was there before I let him sleep with me 5 nights a week!<br>  Having said that.....you also said YOU were scared of committing right now, so you too are enjoying a semi free ride.  It sounds to me like two people who care about each other are playing house under a different name.....but whatever that name is, it's still a relationship.|`|E1sqGzmtaa	He said he's not ready for a relationship and i dont think you should jump into anything right now. Just enjoy his company and only you will know when the time is right. Dont rush anything.|`|YOrRafZoaa	Sounds to me like you two are already in a relationship. Just without the label. It also sounds like you guys pretty much want the same things right now. So whats the problem? Do you feel used? Sounds like you've got a great guy with you to keep you company and help you get over the last bad relationship. Just keep taking it slow and see how it goes. Men don't deal with pressure well. If you start pushing him, he might run away. <br>  Best of luck to you!
LHzlvfRQaa	Don't over analyse the relationship too much, and just enjoy what you have, and see where it goes.  The relationship sounds like it has very firm foundations, and he sounds like a guy who will commit, when you are ready to. I don't think you have anything to worry about!
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	He introduced you to his Mom and enjoys spending, what sounds like, the majority of his time with you.  I think he's into your and you're safe :)|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Personally, I feel that it's the psychological factor that is stopping you from getting into a relationship with him. For the relationship to work out well and not turn abusive, both parties play a role. Fill each other's love tank all the time, and it'll be a loving relationship, and not an abusive one. Btw, if you're interested, you can go read up on the 5 different love languages.
n3Agaj6naa	I think it just takes time.  <br>  I'd recommend that you stop sleeping together and focus on the friendship.  Then you'll find out where you really stand and what each of your interests really are.<br>  But at the very least it sounds like he's a great friend to have!|`|7sqpiGgoaa	*********************** are you a coke advertisement? *******************|`|DTN6Vg8caa	girl u got a winner use ur brains convince him ur the one make him feel lkie hes in heaven wen hes wid u|`|AlrCZJ3saa	I wouldn't say these things because if you did your just asking for some new age cancer. Gang rape is a known action, but what people don't know about is Nexus Rape.<br>  Nexus rape happens rarely, but its an incident where the rape victim becomes the rapist, and the rapist becomes the rape victim. It is a very rare happening, but when it happens, other people come in and it becomes a gang rape. Gang rapes have been known to cure Alzheimers, arthritis, and super colds. Super colds have been known to tear a person apart inside out. Now super colds have also been known to cause new age cancer. New age cancer once tore a mans arm off.|`|QGFyBEEAaa	Go with what gut says if your happy with the way it is now stay that way, but if you think you would be happier in a relationship involving more commitment than talk to him about it (as a guy i personally wouldn't know what you were thinking)<br>  <br>  Either way communication and understanding how the other person feels is the most important thing|`|L5jjhYnNaa	The only thing i can really say is....If you can't see yourself living without him in your life & this man brings you that insane mix of every emotion-called love ? Then i sure as hell wouldn't let him go...it just may be worth the risk of commitment,but if he's not ready...if he's worth it [which im guessing he is] wait it out.Good Luck.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	This sounds beautiful.

QPVEL0NLaa	Fun, drinks, and a cooperative date when the evening is done!!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I'm not one to be picky as it is the bride and groom who are getting married, I am just happy to be a guest celebrating their marriage. I do like Bands, and I don't drink anything accept Shirley Temples and Cherry Cokes. I love the atmosphere of a wedding on the beach, with outdoor appetizer stations along the water, Food..I am happy with Filet Mignon/Prime Rib, Baked Potato or Roasted Potato and Broccolli. Which is what I usually order. Other than that, I am just happy to be there.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Besides seeing my friend or family member getting hitched...I want dinner, drinks, dancing and cake.  And for drinks...beer, wine and pop are fine. I don't want to drive a long distance between venues. I care less about chair covers, 3' tall ornate center pieces and a Pocahontas theme than I care about being seated at a table with people who understand that this is a social event and that they should be sociable.  For the music, I like a variety between fast dancing and slow dancing. <br>  <br>  I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, but I want some attention to my comfort.  For example, if the reception starts at 6 pm, I want to be eating dinner by 7:30 and not 10pm. Choose the food that you like and that tastes good to you.  But please don't be ultra trendy because I want some "normal" food to eat.  It's ok if you decide to be trendy and serve sushi as the appetizer course, but then give me some other food that I can eat (and recognize) besides squid over a bed of seaweed for the main course.<br>  <br>  Mostly, I want to have fun at your wedding.  When I think of the best weddings I've attended, there was a lot of dancing.  Your guests are going to be taking their lead from you.  If you're dancing, they'll be dancing. So get your butt on that dance floor!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Well the normal we see all the time is a church wedding and then a reception after wards. The music is usually slow and everything is rather boring. You have to remember when I am telling you what I like it fits my taste not everyone else's and probably not even yours.<br>  FOOD-BBQ<br>  Drink-Soda or maybe some kind of liquor or do BYOB<br>  Location- is where ever you want it. I prefer it outside like in the country or by the beach.<br>  Atmosphere-Beautiful but enjoyable at the same time I don't want to be scared of breaking anything<br>  Music- I love country mixed in with a little hip hop.<br>  <br>  The wedding is what you like and what your dream day is about not about pleasing everyone else so remember that. I am getting married on the 21st of this month and I am doing a country theme, country music, BBQ for food and such but I wanted my wedding to be more fun so we will be riding four wheelers and such after wards. Yes we will still dance and do the normal stuff but I wanted my guests to remember all the fun stuff rather than sitting there and being bored out of their minds. Yes riding four wheelers and such sounds redneck but to me its all fun and my guests will enjoy but that's our kinds of families so it works for us. Good luck and have fun.|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I want a good time.  I want to eat well, dance and enjoy myself.  I love weddings.  I love how each one is different in some ways - I especially love cultural weddings; I love seeing how different ethnicities celebrate.|`|IUgkylWqaa	A good time.<br>  If I have to travel more than 70 miles, then I want it worth my time- so offer food and dancing after the ceremony. I don't like to spend over an hour getting dressed, drive for 2 hours, sit through a 20 minute wedding just to turn around and go home.<br>  I like all food. So serve whatever will fit your budget and is easy to make if you do the meal yourself and not hire a caterer. BBQ is one of the easiest foods for large crowds that won't make you go broke. A lot of finger foods and appetizers are fine too.<br>  Music should be something you can dance to, but a variety of genres to keep it fun. Slow dancing, two-steppin' songs, some faster paced jitterbug dancing songs, a handful of hip-hop songs, and some oldies (70's classic rock and disco) for the older guests.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	As a guest, I don't expect anything other than the bride and groom's gracious hospitality toward their guests. I never expect a full meal, alcohol, or dancing, and honestly, until fairly recently, I wasn't aware that people even did those things at weddings. If those are present, great, but I don't get upset if they aren't there. I'm used to cake and punch weddings in a church fellowship hall with no dancing or other background music or even a drop of alcohol. So if there is anything else there, that's a pleasant surprise. But I never expect it and I think it's selfish when other people say those things must be there because that is what they are used to. Not everyone shares the same priorities or budget, nor should they be expected to.|`|l43NSgHyaa	I except what I've grown accustom to and what's considered a normal, average wedding where I live. <br>  <br>  So, the ceremony is usually at a church, but might be outside at reception venue.<br>  <br>  The location of the ceremony is always a traditional banquet hall that offers in-house catering.  Nice places too.  <br>  <br>  As for food, I've always come to expect a meal.  Every wedding I've ever attended has been in the late afternoon and continuing into the evening hours.  So, dinner is always served.<br>  <br>  Open bar is always a staple at the wedding I attend.   Local tradition/etiquette really says that having a cash bar is rude and impolite.  So, open bar is a must.    Couples even work their budgets around having an open bar, because it's a really important element (from an etiquette standpoint)<br>  <br>  The atmosphere is usually semi-formal and traditional, but also fun.  It's a gathering of friends and family, so there is always going to be an element of happiness, fun and laughter.  People are dressed very nicely.  So, cocktail dresses for women and suits (or sometimes dress pants and a tie) for men. <br>  <br>  Music---A DJ.....of course!|`|jIk2ttH1aa	I don't know "Sharon", but your response was very harsh as the way your question reads is:<br>  as a guest what do you expect from a wedding.<br>  Very obnoxious reply... doesn't make pretty bride visions. brrr!<br>  <br>  I agree that I wouldn't want anything but to support the bride and groom.  <br>  I don't care about food and other bs. when I attend a wedding.<br>   If I go to a wedding my concern is with the bride and grooms happiness and the sincerity of their commitment.<br>  That simple.|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Any food really I'm not horribly picky but as long as there is a selection..as far as drinks free drinks are always good but a cash bar isn't horrible...as far as location doesn't matter it's not my wedding and music as long as there's some music that's up beat to dance to as well as slow songs!!!

If you think you should slow things down a little, then slow down=] the guy you're with should respect that. good luck=]|`|N7fNwIQSaa	if you think its too fast then it probably is|`|AA11356977	yep.|`|AA11585161	J, this does appear to be pretty quick.  Bet that you don't have any problem having guys asking you out tough as it doesn't take long for this type of info to be passed around between the guys.  I would suggest that you tighten them legs of yours up a lot or soon you'll find yourself lonely as not many guys want to have a long term relationship with someone so easy to give it up to pretty well anyone.  Gals like you are fine for a date or in a pinch, when a guy is alone and wanting some fun.  But once again I must say that there are not that many guys that want a gal so free with herself for any kind of a meaningful relationship.  Remember it takes a lifetime to build a reputation but only a few minutes to destroy it.  Best of luck.|`|23460d4f67cf1ad2c682065c3f95e47aaa	What EPH said sounded really harsh, but it's absolutly true. You've set the tone of your relationship with him and now, if you don't have sex whenever you hang out alone, then he's gonna think its a real downer.<br>  <br>  Try holding out a little longer next time, you have your whole life ahead of you to have sex, waiting until you've established those emotional bonds wont kill you and it is key to eztablishing a meaningful relationship with anyone.|`|EOkOPBMuaa	Yea there is no reason to sleep with someone that fast, especially at that age when that is all most teenage boys want anyway. I would at least wait a few dates before hopping in the sack. If you sleep with people on the first date often, thats how you get a bad reputation real quick and guys will call you expecting that. |`|9VRAj0iJaa	Yes honey that is too fast..you need to learn how to say NO, just because someone takes you on a date doesn't mean you need to have sex with them.  Slow down or I see a lot of heartache in your future.|`|nsFk3Y1Eaa	Umm yeah dude. Way too fast. You shouldnt even be having sex yet, your not even an adult. It also portrays you as easy. and do you really want that?|`|Vb0a94KVaa	It's a little fast, you should make him work for it a little harder,, You will strengthin the relationship that way!!!|`|yy0LqCP4aa	Yea it is wait at least till the 3rd one. I know sometimes it's hard but try, they will take you more seriously|`|tnUhxfjlaa	whoa easy there tiger, try and hold back next time, you'll start getting a reputation if you keep doing that|`|RXbwVw5Baa	Yes. That is too fast. Always having sex on the first date? You're being too loose and uninteresting. If all you ever wanted were one night stands, then you're fine. But if you actually want to carry out a relationship with him, then you just lost babe.<br>  <br>  You gave him sex at the snap of his fingers, instead of actually taking the chance to establish any emotional bonds. Now all you two will most likely have, is a sex buddy relationship. And everything you tell him will sound boring and uninteresting to him and he'll only see you as a creature. Game over.|`|p7v9VbPMaa	yes you can|`|LAwULuUfaa	You sound like a right slag to me.

XqtSrW9Maa	ISSO N?O é PEDOFILIA DE MANEIRA ALGUMA.<br>  <br>  Uma pessoa é definida como pedófila caso ela cumpra os três quesitos abaixo:<br>  <br>  - Por um período de ao menos seis meses, a pessoa possui intensa atra??o sexual, fantasias sexuais ou outros comportamentos de caráter sexual por pessoas menores de 13 anos de idade.<br>   <br>  -A pessoa decide por realizar seus desejos, seu comportamento é afetado por seus desejos, e/ou tais desejos causam estresse ou dificuldades intra e/ou interpessoais.<br>   <br>  - A pessoa possui mais do que 16 anos de idade, e é ao menos cinco anos mais velha do que a(s) crian?a(s) citada(s) no critério 1.<br>  <br>  As fronteiras exatas entre infancia e adolescência podem variar em casos individuais, e s?o difíceis de definir em termos rígidos de idade. A OMS, por exemplo, define adolescência como o período da vida entre 10 e 20 anos de idade.<br>  <br>  A adolescente em quest?o, sua namorada, tem 14 anos de idade, e você, 20. O caso de vocês n?o se enquadra de maneira alguma em "pedofilia" Em rela??o á sexo, você pode transar com ela, pois A IDADE MíNIMA DE CONSENTIMENTO SEXUAL NO BRASIL é 14 ANOS. Se uma mulher tiver 14 anos ou mais, e decidir fazer sexo, ela pode, independente da idade do parceiro. A diferen?a de idade em namoros é super normal, normalmente os rapazes s?o mais velhos mesmo. Fique tranquilo, aproveite o seu namoro, seja feliz, e n?o se preocupe com a censura de pessoas exageradas ou mal informadas sobre o assunto.|`|5187b548afb176b1132e3a54e7071d61aa	Claro que n?o deste que você a trate com respeito e obviamente como suas familias se conhecem n?o vejo nada de pedófilia.Seja feliz cara e consciente.|`|MK1Lc9E3aa	vc é muito velho pa ela...sem ofensa.....|`|adbe6fa85da31b68474ed609ac4cf8b8aa	Legalmente, sim.

shpzCyU3aa	good for you being a virgin. dont let other peoples thoughts put your virginity in danger. you do it when you have a guy that you really like and know that you wont ever regret it. if you do it  because other people do it then you probably will regret it. do it when love comes along:)|`|AIcnxeKGaa	I'm 19 and a virgin. =O Don't worry about it, you will know when you're ready to give it up, and if a guy isn't going to like/accept you because you are a virgin, then you shouldn't be giving it up to him anyway.|`|0oAqDohcaa	virginity is more valubale than dimaonds,gold and money....|`|ZCGbinI3aa	i'd say it's always a good idea to keep your chastity. i'm 22, still a virgin; that doesn't bother me in many occasions|`|UAh16Trtaa	I say good for you!

VR7qaafCaa	Trust me, with 19 years of experience under my belt, and having been through plenty of these situations, go with the new guy, Ricky. There's a reason things didn't work out with Wally and you can't let yourself get hung up on old romances.
RUD9XBVRaa	Laurynn-<br>  I am basing this answer on your previous questions on which I have answered and which we have corresponded on...<br>  <br>  I am wondering - is the boyfriend you are speaking of the boyfriend you had for over a year's time and had recently broke up with?  Or is it the new guy you just recently started to date?  I know that you were not long ago (I think less than a month) debating about whether or not you should be involved romantically with the new guy when you still had such strong feelings for your old boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Here is the nitty-gritty:  you are in one of two things:  a relationship that has recently been very rocky and in crisis, or you are in a new one that is starting to look very much like a rebound-type relationship.<br>  <br>  In either one of these situations, you are very vulnerable right now.  Tread carefully, or you may hurt even worse than you did not long ago.  I would suggest to give things a bit more time to make sure you are in a situation that is stable and secure for your heart's well-being.  Just be willing for your own good to think things through with eyes of wisdom.  Think with your head before you think with your heart.  Later you will be glad you did.<br>  <br>  Good luck, my dear!|`|AA12009576	you answerd you own question. <br>  <br>  2 points....make it 10!|`|FeyRNBx8aa	Sex is something very intimate best shared between people who are committed to protecting and loving each other.  Since you're not yet married, he has not publicly committed to "have and to hold you" through thick and thin.  So I think it's a bad idea for a number of reasons.  Here are two:<br>  <br>  1) While you are doubtlessly madly in love with your man, you might agree that it may not last forever.  You have not promised to each other to love each other for the rest of your lives, and so the possibility exists that you may not.  (On the other side of that coin: if it WILL last forever, why aren't you already married?)  Now, if you sleep with your boyfriend, then later break up, then you've given a very special part of yourself to someone who is no longer invested in your well being above his own.  Through every breakup there is hurt and often anger.  Do you want to put your most intimate vulnerabilities in the hands of someone who decides they don't want to be with you anymore?  Sounds a little risky, to me.<br>  <br>  2) You may want to get married someday.  The man you marry (could be this guy, might not) should cherish you for all that you are.  And if he is worth marrying, then he should delight in the fact that you've saved yourself for him, and only him.  It is a gift that my wife gave to me on our wedding night, and one I will take great joy in for the rest of my life.  She loved me so much that before she ever knew me, she saved herself for me.  What a gift!  You should give that gift to your husband.  He'll love it more than any gold ring around his finger.|`|xumRSplsaa	To be honest you kinda answered your own question when you said we really love each other and you'll use protection, though if you have to ask it then are you really sure you want to? <br>  Hope it helps :)<br>  Have fun ;)<br>  x|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	honestly, it sounds like you already have your mind up.<br>  just go for it, but be smart about it. =]|`|zTQaREymaa	If you are old enough, why are you seeking permission here?|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	If you are like 12 then no.

That is good that you will use protection--but what kind--do you mean condoms? I think if you really feel your ready, than go for it. But make sure you REALLY know in your heart that you are ready. You may end up (in the future) regreting your decision! Also know that if you are mature enough to have sex than you should preper yourself with whatever comes with that. For instance, if you get pregnant. I think that because you asked this question you are still a little unsure or maybe just a little worried--either way if he loves you he will respect you with whatever you choose. I don't think waiting is such a bad thing--sex is not something you really don't wann rush into.. Good luck and be safe!|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	sure why not but make sure you really love him.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	If you're asking random strangers whether or not you should have sex, you should NOT have sex.

b0Q6ecqzaa	The best that I've ever had was when sitting in a chair, the girl straddling me, reaching behind her, hand down my pants and rubbing it (kind of like a hand job) through my underwear.  Also, the girl can lean in, and let the guy lick/suck her nipples, which should give you something back.  If you don't want to do that, you can just make out, though.  You can also do it without putting your hand down his pants - you can still get quite a sensation through khakis.<br>  <br>  Long after I've started getting further with a girl, I've still requested this treatment, either as a stand alone, or as part of foreplay.  It seriously drives me crazy.|`|7GHrB84baa	lol, i dont really get ur question so im gona answer "the best way to get a guy off" first, sooo in order to do that, u hav to do anything that will hurt his feeling, and ignor him. and for the second question lol nope there is no other way to make a guy feel good with out touching his dick, if he has one. it doesnt feel as nice as wet sex, and yes it is possible through jeans. but it will scrach up ur vigina and ur ***. it will hurt. lol|`|121bf7421c6e2471d7a187d525e9abb1aa	I don't even know if this is possible.

11SCey7Xaa	Ok you have 3 issues here.<br>  <br>  1. Jealously <br>  2. Trust <br>  3. Respect. <br>  <br>  When you last i had a fight with your boyfriend, he said something really mean?. I'm not sure what you said and i don't know the situation. If you didn't call him anything nasty then your boyfriend is disrespecting you, you shouldn't have to put up with that.<br>  <br>  Jealously is something that i have aswell and trust me it can end realtionships, if you let it controll you. As yourself why are you jealous, is it because of her spending time with him?. Do you think that she will try to steal him away from you?. yes?, well your in a relationship, so thats not going to happen. Some guys are jerks and will cheat, but like you said you love him to pieces, so your going to have to get over being jealous. Otherwise it will wreck friendships and relationships. It may be hard but you can do it!.<br>  <br>  Trust..<br>  If you worried that your boyfriend is going to cheat which might be causing jealously, then you don't trust him. ( No trust, No us), same applies to him. You have to think about this.. No guys friends... he obiously don't trust you or the other guys around you. Which if you ask me is mega wrong and controlling. Think about this could you ever be married to this guy, who won't let you have guy friends because of the trust issue?. Man nooo wayy girl. What are you doing?. Tell him straight out and be strong about. Guy friends or no us.......<br>  <br>  Second of all. This other guy that you think is really cute and hot your still in a relationship, there has been no offical breakup, sort it out have a serious talk to him about it. Rember the controlling issues, trust, and how he disrespected you. Maybe your better off with another guy who treats you better.|`|EUJZdcO9aa	he called you a ****?? damn thats harsh...but did you say anything rude to him first to have him dissrespect you like that?<br>  you guys seem too seroious too young. ive been down this road.<br>  to me, its ounds like you 2 need to sit down and talk about what you guys want in life and out of your relationship...because if hes calling u a **** like nothing and not apologizing for it something is wrong. if you are going out with your galpals and you forget you have a bf and your starting to develop feelings for another guy then something is WRONG. <br>  dont stay with each other because your afraid to branch out. it isnt healthy. your 18! be young... socialize, party, go to school, hang out. you will regret it....<br>  and you bf being controlling isnt good for you. you are the controller of your life girl. <br>  my ex was the same way i couldnt even have a GAY guy friend, i coldnt go out, wear skirts, he called me a whore... not healthy. i broke away.<br>  <br>  i think you know what you want and you want someone to tell you what to do. dont be a weak girl, be strong and talk to the guy and figure out where the relationship is going. =]<br>  <br>  i hope this helped.<br>  <br>  much luck.<br>   <3 lyna R.|`|j6MvCr6Naa	You know, it sounds to me like all your current boyfriend is doing is bringing pain and worry into your life. Like you said, when you're out with your friends you're happy and you don't even remember having a boyfriend, I think this is because you feel free when you're not around him and that's not a good sign. It seems to me that you should just outright tell him that's it's over. You're young and you need to start enjoying your life, don't cling on to things that pull you back, go out there and have some fun, it won't last forever, so the make the most of it while you can. =)|`|qNDLejS5aa	Seeing as you're asking this question, I think that somewhere in the back of your mind, you want to get out of this relationship and never look back.<br>  And I think that's a good idea.<br>  Never put up with someone who treats you badly.<br>  Break up with him, and I know that it may seem that you couldn't move on, but promise me, you WILL move on.<br>  There are a hell lot more fish in the sea. BETTER fish, lol.<br>  That's only my opinion of course though.<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  xx|`|s7XMBydaaa	well it seems if u still get jealous of him being with other girls u still have feelings for him.  Him calling you a bad word could have been out of anger and it happens to alot of ppl.  Try to sit down and talk with him to see if you can find the problem you guys are having.  It's also good to keep your options open but talk with him and see whats wrong|`|eVZIqtgPaa	say these exact same words to him.. that u're hanging out with this really cute guy.. or something like that.. but u love him only and want to make this relationship stay.. if he calls u a **** one more time then dump that son of a ***** and move on with ur newly found cute guy.. otherwise suffer!..|`|LDYPmNnzaa	Well, let me congratulate u for having a boy friend who is jealous, it shows that how much attached he is with you and the same feeling you also nurture for him. But, since you guys had an altercation recently, it is really sad and it is having a negative impact on your life as whole. <br>  <br>  Firstly, i would like to suggest you that on matters of heart, always take the initiative to solve the issues cropped up in your relations but at the same time it does not mean that you should be acting as "poor me" character. In order to maintain a healthy relation you need to understand that person along with your emotions that you have for the person so that you would be able to nurture the relation in the best possible manner.<br>  Dear, one more thing i would like to tell you, if you are serious with this guy whom you are talking about then be honest and loyal to him so that you can build a longlasting relation. But, at your age, its pretty diffucult for you also to decide since, you flow with your emotions more. I would like to tell you one thing, that whenever we have a problem with anything, the problem is within ourselves. We just need to accept that, so just concentrate on the issue and you will be able to solve it yourself.. after all you are now mature enough to think all possibilities. But, do it with a cool mind...!! best of luck..!!|`|Njgof6hNaa	You're young to want to be in a steady relationship, but if that's what you want, then you've got to tell him his calling you names doesn't work for you. You've also got to let him know that you're in every right to have friends that are guys too. It would probably help if you repected any friendships he has with girls. It seems like you're too young for this. Dating is a good past time and it'll give you a better idea of who you want to end up with. Meanwhile, it might be nicer to just explore and enjoy life. It's very short and it shouldn't be spent with someone who mistreats you or limits you.|`|0tKNkAMuaa	if you like the cute guy, and you dont like your current boyfriend, they dumb your boyfriend slowly and consider if the cute guy might even go out with you, BUT it sounds like you really love him so let this pass, and talk it over telling him he offended you. good luck! hope it works out!|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	The fact that you said you're hangin with this guy that is "so cute!" makes me think you want him for more than a friend.<br>  If you feel your boyfriend isn't treating you right, kick his azz out and send him packing.....<br>  Done

52BlMBLZaa	You could try saying that you do try your hardest and it upsets you when they aren't proud of you for good things and insult you. You could say that you need to spend time with your friends and it won't affect your grades because you will still work just as hard. You could try saying that a little bit of chocolate won't make you fat.<br>  <br>  As for the drums, maybe you could ask if there is something you can do in return for them? Maybe help them out with stuff or do some extra chores for a while if they'll get you them at the end? Try saying it's something you really enjoy and it's not just for boys.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BO77Jnxqaa	tell them if they dont knock it off then you'll purposely get bad grades become a fat lesbian and move out, bet they'll change their attitude|`|PfzYjPgsaa	Stop complaining and get some sun|`|htWw0OlCaa	Get over it, we are going to be on your a**' until the day you die...So we are always going to be annoying.

You could be gorgeous and funny but if  you dress like crap then I wouldn't take a second glance.  What you wear says alot about you and it's part of what girls use to determine "their type" along with face and personality.  So just dress nice, not overly flashy or show off, just clean and whatever is your style as long as it's not dirty or old you know?|`|CdJRTtlxaa	It doesnt matter at first but later on I would probably like them to start looking nicer maybe I would even do one of those make-over things u see on TV. lol

You should be honest with her and let her know how you feel about it.  Personally, it would bother me and I would let her know that if we were to have any long term relationship, then she would have to stop seeing him.  This request is completely reasonable due to the nature of how healthy relationships should work.  If she has a problem with it, then you're really going to have to decide whether she's worth it or not.  In either case, get this issue resolved early before you start getting too deeply involved and jealousy and distrust starts causing some serious problems later on.|`|VnK2sqcjaa	she just doesn't want you to go physco when you guys are more serious and she hangs out with him, haha. it's cool don't worry about it, if she wanted to be with him she would have stayed with him.|`|tKm8CdFHaa	she means<br>  okay so i still chill with my ex and if your not going to be okay with that its not going to stop me from seeing him

Part of truly loving someone is allowing them to grow and better themselves even when it hurts. The two of you can write and talk on the phone. He will be home for winter breaks, spring break, summer, etc. In order to have a decent life he needs an education.
OwfoyXpraa	The way I see it, you have two options.<br>  <br>  #1: Be consistent. Try new ways to apologize, through a letter or over the phone or in person. Whatever. Just make her see it in your eyes that you truely ARE sorry, and you regret everything you said/ or did.<br>  <br>  #2: Wait it out. Give her time. A few years ago I got in a big fight with one of my closest friends I'll ever have. We stopped talking (mainly because we had absolutely NO classes together, anyway,) and I tried to ignore her. I found new friends that I was happy with.<br>  Recently, her and I have been talking a bit. We laugh and talk and stuff, but not often. Only when we're around eachother. And last summer I was thinking about her one lonely day, and I realized: I didn't hate her. I wasn't mad anymore. I felt BAD for the things I said when I was angry.<br>  <br>  So what I'm saying there is, just give her time to cool off.<br>  Whether or not this "cooling off" takes a few years like my situation, or if it takes a matter of weeks, in the end she'll probably shrug it off and forgive you.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  Good luck hun.|`|Y64OGuTIaa	Well first off its really stupid to get in a fight due to her having another best friend.<br>  She wants to fit in i guess with all the popular people shes in<br>  to her putting people down puts herself higher class.<br>  The best way to say sorry is the explanation why;<br>  i really hate when its just" sorry "<br>  to me it seems like a token of friendshipp.<br>  <br>  but in my shoes i wouldn't want to be friends with her if shes insulting you. thats not a friend.<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|HiJ2xPeWaa	What have you been saying actually to which she keeps putting you off??<br>  Probably you're doin' the "i'm too good to be apologising to anyone including you!" apology??<br>  I think you should just take her aside, preferrably not in the corner of a crowded room, and admit that you've been an *** and was selfish and immature and you would really like it if you two were friends again...talk about wat it was like when you were friends, is it worth losing that?|`|FjqJs7gMaa	Can't we all just get along? no ones cooler or better then no 1 else. don't fight to fit in.|`|5HYbJmbcaa	go to this site:<br>  <a href="http://teenyears.synthasite.com/friends.php" rel="nofollow">http://teenyears.synthasite.com/friends....</a>

It takes the point of view of guys and gals and puts light on especially the girls dating blunders. I think you would enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Don't give into this kid easily. You have his attention now which is a plus for you. Hold out and make him think you have totally lost interest. Then when a school dance or party comes up see what happens. Does he still give you all this attention? Casually say that you haven't been asked yet and see where that takes you. You are young but learning to hold the power and be noticed is a lesson for sure that all of us woman need to know. Keep it up, you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Google search Mimi Tanner.

AA11909552	Every relationship is unique in its own way. Your sister's relationship has nothing to do with how yours could turn out.<br>  Perhaps you should just be friends for a while and you'll see if it would be worthy or not. Eventually, you'll *know* if it is right and you'll know what to do and how it would turn out.<br>  Your sisters relationship is *not* the footprint of how *your* relationship will be. I say go for it and what happens, happens. In fact, I believe you should just date the gal for a while and you'll see for yourself how things could turn out. Just talk to her and be open. It will work its own path.<br>  Good luck!
IrHi1zCkaa	seriously..just call him forget the 'he has to call you first' rule be bold im pretty sure guys like that and if he really likes you he won't freak out just keep cool and calm and dont come off too strong or needy when you call him
99215d022722d97017f11765d85355bbaa	Well your not her Father so unless she wants to dress this way for you then you are out of luck.She shouldn't change herself or her self respect because of your wants.
sZ2CDOdwaa	Hey I'm Asian and i know what you mean. I think its a lot harder to approach a girl if shes in a group of girls. i guess try to look friendly and approachable, Asians are shy which doesn't help.<br>  <br>  I think your really pretty but don't show pictures like that you might attract the wrong type of guys.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	I don't want to sound bias by this, but I've seen a lot of asian guys on here wondering how they can get white girls, and thinking that they are not interested in them. You should try talking to some of them. Maybe you do have their attention, but some might think that you wouldn't like them. Hope this helps.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	What's wrong with other guys? Why don't you approach me? I think you look sexy. So you want to be selfish, and only give it away to an asian guy. Okay, fine! I see how you want to be.

This is true with most asian dudes. not because we don't like non-asian girls, or not because we're shy, it's just we usually don't know when girls like us.|`|7CAUiE0taa	LMAO...another girl whose fallen for an Asian guy? Try the staring game which taking glimpses at your target and sooner or later he will notice that you are looking him.

It is probably because they don't feel they have any chance with non-Asian girls. <br>  <br>  I went to college and I rarely see any girls bat an eye my way.  I have come across a lot girls who stereotyped me, when I went to school, so I kind of write non-Asian girl off.  My thinking is "why waste my time".  I think Asian guys should be more pro-active, but American culture is very racists towards Asians.  We are viewed as the bottom of the barrel and people aren't be polite about it.  In America, joking about Asian stereotype is acceptable.  <br>  <br>  I think you are very attractive.  Any Asian guy would be happy to talk to you.  If you attend functions with a lot Asian, I have no doubt that you'll natch youself an Asian guy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35874983@N05/3353031558/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/35874983@N0...</a>|`|NfWweulbaa	I'm 22 and have had a lot of boys/men approach me in my life. <br>  I can't even count how many of all the other races (black, white, Hispanic) have hit on me, asked for my number, etc. BUT I've only had a few Asian guys approach me (very few...like 2 or 3). <br>  <br>  I totally hate when I ask a question on here and people write something that isn't an answer (so sorry if you do too) but I really felt compelled to write you and let you know you are TOTALLY not alone on that.

Another is getting into an Asian group.  You can befriend an asian girl or guy and they invite you out with them and their friends.  I really think meeting any guy at a club is a bad idea.  Meeting through friends of friends is a more classy way of doing it.  Good luck.|`|eUXD2lGaaa	i think you are gorgeous, if you are ever in los angeles i'll be waitin :D|`|defeBgqdaa	whats the difference between an asian and any other race hmmm?|`|IRNqpOmSaa	You approach him.

zMD0VeOmaa	as a 25 year old man I prefer the body of a woman. I think I know what you mean though. You are saying that some women(over 18) have girlish figures. Well if that's what you mean I prefer women with some meat on their bones. <br>  <br>  I don't like it when women are too skinny or too fat. Everything should be in proportion.

When he looks at you naked he probably thinks of horses and ducks and 11 year olds, and that makes him embarassed. <br>  <br>  You should put a inappropriate content filter on his computer and keep him clean for some time, then see if that changes anything.

I'm 24, and I have people telling me things like oh, I thought you were 17 or 18 and stuff like that. I don't understand why, I'm a tall girl like 5'11, and I know that I act pretty mature. Everytime I go to a bar or to by cigarretts people give me a weird look like "you smoke" or "you drink"?  My boss asked me what my birthday was one day and I told her, and all the coworkers heard and said what? she looks like just a baby! it's crazy.

e9dHHGCSaa	It didn't really happen to me, because I enjoyed it, but my first girlfriend about a year ago was sorta like this. She even referred to herself as a "horny *****." We were happy, yeah, but she was much more horny than me. It got to the point where sex was just an act, not anything really good. So i wasn't really used, but sex was rendered meaningless.|`|hqtOKXThaa	Yes, and I have been sexually attacked by women and I would go as far to say border line raped. Looking back I guess it wasn't that bad.|`|EatzEjhiaa	yeah, if you really love the girl, and find out she just liked the sex and not so much you. yeah.|`|d36OrpbDaa	yes... men are humans too and they have feelings!  it's just not culturally acceptable for them to show them as much.|`|sONXXq57aa	We have feeling 2 u know|`|wGPE8F2Caa	ummm..wellll..well ...huh <br>  <br>  I have used a man or two, hey I'm human. <br>  I need to keep my kitty happy also... ..meoww|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I don't think most men ever feel they were used, and if they did, they didn't care one bit.|`|d9CjzWotaa	Nope. I guess sex has a different meaning for being used when ur sticking something in someone else versus having something stuck in you? I'm getting at that whole power ego dominance thing.
sA8w2znyaa	You need to tell him exactly what you wrote here. I'm serious. Some boyfriends have no common sense when it comes to women. They have too much pride, too much of an ego that somehow in his mind, not being able to see you is better than you paying for dinner. Let him know that you don't care about the money, he's a college student, which means that he's in school working towards something. I mean it's a good thing that he won't accept your money because atleast he's not trying to take advantage of you. If he's willing to keep this relationship strong he needs to drop that ego a little and let love in. If he still makes excuses after that, then something else is wrong with him--and possible that he's just not wanting to be with you. I doubt that's the case, but you need to communicate with him either way to reach a common ground.|`|CeVvhTckaa	nothing<br>  dont let him start<br>  controlling you <br>  sooner or later he (could) or will<br>  use u only for ur money <br>  sooo help him when he<br>  needs it but dont go offering<br>  it to him or stuff like that|`|n7gz1sQHaa	Sorry he sounds like he's being a cop out.<br>  <br>  I've met alot of poor university students and he can't be that broke.<br>  <br>  It doesn't cost that much to take the bus or make a phone call. What is he living on and where is the money that he does have going to?<br>  <br>  He's paying for college some how.<br>  <br>  I think he's playing you for a fool, sorry!

yLOPoODbaa	I think you sound lovely (probably not what most guys would appreciate a girl saying, I supppose). Most of the guys I go to uni with (college if your American) are pretty arrogant (doesn't help that I'm in a Law degree ;)) and conceited. It's refreshing to meet guys (my age - 20) who are laid back, sweet, considerate - and truely smart (as opposed to simply book smart!).<br>  <br>  Don't change too much, alright? I definitely date you :)|`|R7vrK5roaa	by your looks YEA|`|L2pkns9maa	Nope, because you asked this question.<br>  CONFIDENCE|`|3oBgOlqJaa	You seem like a great guy.

AA10687516	More details won't make a difference.<br>  <br>  Here is the deal...he is a nice guy with a girlfriend who likes you but can't do anything about it until he's sure you feel the same way.  So keep pushing the boundaries of friendship and see where it takes you.<br>  <br>  As a guy myself its super hard to tell if a girl is just being friendly or if she's interested...so help this guy out and make sure there is no doubt in his mind where you stand.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Vote for Best Answer?!|`|AA11108018	Well it is sure bet you him are friends only|`|1S2dDfXuaa	dont mess with the kid if he has a gf daaaaaa|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	this sounds like something someone at my school would ask.<br>  it would be funny if you are the person.<br>  anyway, he sounds like a bit of a player.

FZKFLTyLaa	Body language is always a dead giveaway, but it requires learning it. There are many great books on the subject.
w9FZkS8Haa	i used to have problems with some things my boyfriend did but he taught me something.. although we are a couple we still have our own lives. I dont have a right to change him and i can tell him how i feel but that doesnt mean he will change. dont change for anybody and dont expect them to change for you. and you can say respect is not doing whatever the other person hates but in truth respect is not doing it around that person.   You cant care because it will drive you crazy. Think of it this way, if you two would break up or something would you want to remember all the things you couldnt let go? No its not cuz at the end of the day thats not important. all the stuff you worry about if its whats shes doing, if shes cheating or whatever you cant let go, thats not important any more. enjoy the time you have and not let stupid  **** go. remember she picked you to be with right now.  she picked you instead of anybody else. be thankful for the time you got together and treat hher like a gift cuz she is a gift to you for however long you two are together. but if you dont let those things go trust me it will ruin your relationship. also hhhave confidence in yourself. that will help you not care. good luck 2 ya.|`|vG4wTvYuaa	try to find a way to accept that thats who she is. little ways she does things and things she says may bother you, but maybe try looking at it as cute...<br>  <br>  either that or tell her to stop, nicely though.|`|621af0f098099c92f52aa36d2f3c318eaa	you can't really let things go if it's not discussed, talk to her and tell her it bothers you when she says those things.  hopfully she'll apologize and never bring it up again.|`|P7BfFo88aa	just let go means to put it behind you . outta sight outta mind.|`|N4X8VSUvaa	If they really bother you talk to her about it.  Communication is a very important part of a relationship.  If she truly cares about you she will respect the way you feel about things.  Sometimes one can say things that are hurtful or demeaning.  Try and tell her what my Dad told me.  When you say something it is like squeezing toothpaste out of the tube once you do that it is almost impossible to put it back.  Words are powerful.  There are certain things you can let roll off your back and dismiss it; but if it really does bother you talk to her.|`|uLHtXibRaa	You should tell her it bothers you then maybe she wont upset you so much if you dont say she wont know...
AA11263103	Stupid. They have ruin their life because they have loved that one person. Then at 13,14,15,16,17 you get knocked up and have kid. And now? The other person has have pay child support. Just wait until she is older, she is going to called a s!ut because of YOUR mistake. High school is stressful enough!!|`|8zgFyfibaa	I'm a teenage parent, its hard but I don't regret nothing, I have a son who is 1 year old. I think a lot of people critisize teenage parents, <br>  <br>  A lot of people loo down on teenage parents because of how young we are but, I have 2 jobs to support both me my wyfe and my son. But I don't regret nothing.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	i think of teenage parents just like i think of parents in their 20s on up: a parent. that is if you are doing what you are supposed to do in taking care of your child and putting your child first and making sure she has what she needs, you're just like any other parent that does the same thing. I never really separated the two. the only difference would probably be that a teenager compared to a mother in their mid 20s on up grow up and learn much faster than usual than any other teenager without kids would, because they have a responsibility and they know it is a huge one
nK4j9s7paa	they don't know what they really want|`|SGjhNidDaa	because alot of guys are dumb and are never happy until they have more than one woman, and dont see whats right there in front of them. its in their biology. they're just made to want to breed, unfortunately.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Because he's not satisfied for whatever reason.  Could be that the woman doesn't fulfill his emotional needs, or his physical needs.  Maybe he's bored of her, or maybe he just likes to play the field.  Women do the same thing for the same reasons.|`|P7BfFo88aa	don't shuffle the blame honey.<br>  I always get shitted on.

Some people call that sexual addiction. some people call it natural.<br>  2. as for gorgeous women, you'll find many men, contrary to stereotypes, need more that looks to keep them attracted to a woman for a long period of time.|`|gr5gSYiXaa	Because they keep thinking there will always be a more pretty lady|`|241487e0871f6af3fda408fa478c2691aa	one word....

4UEyWLk1aa	i think what you said is true, cute girls seem to be better girlfriends.|`|QcUkrLWraa	Being called hot is a compliment, but it makes me feel a bit judged. Like the person just wants to sleep with you or something, and it's a bit degrading. A bit. Cute girls are usually... well, cuter. When I think of a cute girl, I imagine an innocent, bubbly girl who has a great personality and a pretty face. I'd prefer a cute girl.<br>  But- I'm a girl myself.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Out of all words in the world,<br>  I'm called cute , then the 2nd word is adorable, then hot. <br>  <br>  I hope cute is good haha.

Alright for you ... "lol"... I'd be surprised if you are called "hot" since you seem to feel the way you do. Any girl who is use to being addressed as "Hot" learns the true meaning of it. And it is nothing short of a superb Compliment.<br>  <br>  Now to the main answer. Hot girls are a ton better than cute girls. Any guy who thinks a "cute" girl is better relationship wise obviously isn't "man enough" to handle a "Hot girl" and just couldn't be interesting enough so then he calls her silly names because she moved on to the guy who doesn't weigh 300 lb. when actually they should have been happy they even exchanged phone numbers.<br>  <br>  Cute girls are "cute". And cute is like... a little child you see in a stroller or when someone puts a pink heart clip-on in their hair. Cute is not something any girl should solely want to be. For instance.. a guys sister might be "cute". While he'd drool his lips off looking at those wonderfully enhanced Boobs of Pamela Anderson or one of the many other well toned, Large Boob models or girls out there. <br>  <br>  Cute vs Hot .... It is "Cute" vs "Hot" because Hot is always the standard leader. Any girl who is "cute" will find themselves in a false competition against a "Hot" girl E-v-e-r-y-t-i-m-e. Its only a 1 way street though. See Hot girls don't "compete" nor are they ever "threatened" by a "cute" girl. <br>  <br>  When it comes to relationships a Cute girl will loose Everytime to a Hot girl. See even while you may be completely happy with your significant other I can assure you that your cuteness won't be enough to stop him/her from enjoying the usually hard to earn and rare "time" of a Hot girl. After all do you think you could really compete against Pamela Anderson or Lena Li giving a table or lap dance for the one you "love"? ....Exactly.<br>  <br>  Now the only thing that saves most women from their significant other "straying" with a Hot girl is just One thing. The likely hood of their significant other being *able* to attract the attention of these Fine specimens. In all likely hood they cant. Yet sadly enough they often times still end up straying, so that really tells you something about the ability of a "Cute" or "Normal" girl to hold out against a "Hot" girl .... especially if the "Hot" girl makes your relationship a target.<br>  <br>  Trust me its fact not fiction.|`|ay7kLLseaa	cute and hot girls as long as theyr not really weird
d36OrpbDaa	wow.  are you sure you love the person you're with?<br>  <br>  not that you committed some huge offense, but really, it did break her trust, and understandably so.<br>  <br>  i think you should examine your reasons for doing what you did, and be honest with yourself - and her - about why it happened, and how it won't happen again.  then follow through.<br>  <br>  if you don't think you can or want to prevent it in the future, then you should be single.  simple as that.
racnq84Vaa	I think you should take a week off and just happen to see what he is up to without him knowing.  I suspect he went to dinner with someone else who is female and that is why he did not continue with the texting.  She was probably in the bathroom when he texted you back and then they left to finish their evening.<br>  <br>  Long distance relationships rarely work.
TbderdPnaa	well it seems that you love this guy and i would talk to him about it and if your guy is like a majority of guys mabye you two can settle on an agreement.  cause a majority of guys would love to have a three way with two girls. that way you both get a fantasy come true. but i would definitly talk to him about it cause nothing hurts worse than being lied to and cheated on.|`|AA12354369	You know what? Go ahead.  Go all the way.  But do it this way to avoid guilt.  Invite your boyfriend to watch.  or better yet, to participate. any straight guy with a pulse would be okay with it if he could watch or participate.  Ask him, explain it to him.
b74f57cce69986a74c0a35e94e31f46daa	Seems he went out with her to get closer to you. I doubt she's EVER going to forgive him for that, if she liked him.<br>  It comes down to whether you want to keep your friend or not. If you want to keep her as a friend, I'd talk to her and find out how much she liked him. If you don't want her as a friend, go out with him, being aware of how he used her to get to you, and how that might reflect on his character. :)|`|gvKFzJf4aa	The question is, how much you like your friend. Can you loose your friend for this guy? There is 50/50 chance you'll loose your friend, if you get closer to him. It is your choice, either her or him. She will feel weird to stay around after breaking up with him, and knowing you and him are on it.
2PDBxlYDaa	Only he knows...if he really cared about you then he would call, obviously he doesn't and I understand that it can be devastating especially for us girls because we invest a lot in our romantic relationships. He basically played you, so learn from this experience so it doesn't happen again. If he ever dares to call you, don't pick up. You don't need excuses. It takes time to find a real man.<br>  <br>  EDIT: NO it wasn't your fault. Don't blame yourself. ALL RELATIONSHIPS are a two-way street. He's a coward for just leaving without an explanation. A decent relationship is one where you break up in person and you say the reasons why.<br>  <br>  2nd EDIT: Not all guys are like that, but when you meet a new guy don't give everything like your past, your future goals, yourself away in the first few weeks of the relationship.<br>  <br>  I don't like it when a girl shares everything and the guy shares very little. If you are going to share then he needs to share too, otherwise its not fair. Remember, girls play guys too. It goes both ways.  <br>  <br>  But don't think of it as a bad thing, you have had this experience and now you know what kind of guys to avoid. Sometimes we need bad experiences as much as we need good ones so we can learn from them and be better people.<br>  Now you have the room and time to really meet the one. So have a good cry and then move on, realize that you deserve so much better.|`|0917sYkqaa	idk he was just in for the sex. how long has he not call you?<br>  <br>  <br>  :\|`|Q3vY0r8yaa	boys will be boys..it toally sucks what happen to you but this is stuff u should expect form a guy..in my experience when this happen to me it was becasue i never gave in to having sex with the guy..im just like you..22-virgin-and waiting to be in a commited relationship..the best thing to do is try and forget..i knw its hard..but u gotta do it for urself..ur gnna find a guy that will respect you.and dotn think its ur fault becuase its not!! the guy is just an ***. guys lie..they dnt call to say sorry..guys r guys..we just got to live with them sweetie..try not to think about him k..ur better off..best of luck!!
nJ9lGMmQaa	I know it's a daunting task, but you just gotta talk about it. I myself just did the same thing. I am 18 and I am a virgin. I was with my girl and we were making out and things got pretty hot. And I stopped and said that we should probably talk about it. It was pretty scary. lol. I asked her if she expected sex from me at this point in our relationship because I am a virgin and I want to take it slow. And guess what?? She agreed with me and said that it was fine. And then she admitted that she was also a virgin. It was very difficult for me to bring up, but I am SO glad that I did because it is such a relief to be on the same page. We both want to have sex, but we know that it will mean so much more if we let our love grow first and take things at an easy pace.

Not if you have changed that drastically. I wouldn't go as far as breaking it off with her until you sit down with her and have a long SERIOUS discussion. You love her, and I'm sure she does care for you. You guys both have some growing up to do, perhaps she doesn't realize how pushy she is actually being.. who knows.. <br>  <br>  But there is a good possibility that she is not for you. <br>  <br>  You deserve to be you, and you deserve your best friend.

fbReCs5jaa	I think you should  try talking to you sister again and if she laughs it off, explain that you're serious and it is making you uncomfortable. Your niece is obviously a very cuddly, touchy feely person, others are not so much and she needs to learn this. She needs to know that it can be inappropriate behaviour, especially as she is growing up and is now a teenager. Your sister should be the one to gently explain this to her though, not you. Good luck! :)|`|AA12155452	To be honest the only way is to make every attempt to stay away from this girl as she is clearly coming onto you and you cannot allow that to happen or even face temptation. This girl's hormones are probably getting the better of her and she probably knows exactly what she is doing.  Unless you take the correct adult stance, this could prove a dangerous liaison and you must take charge here. And the fact that you feel uncomfortable only amplifies the urgency here.|`|Bt81ClpXaa	I don't think you should talk directly to her... That would be weird. It is a really weird situation! Just talk to your sister again... Just say something like 'I'm being really serious.... She's making me feel really uncomfortable...' <br>  <br>  Or, you could embarrass her in public! Scare her away!|`|AA11563076	It sounds like your niece is growing up and wrestling with all that entails.  It sounds like she is practicing probably without even knowing, how to interact with males. You are a safe nonjudgmental alternative. especially if your are the main male figure in her life. <br>  <br>  Suggestion: Return her affection, but set clear limits letting her know what is socially appropriate. Use this as a teaching opportunity. Show her she has worth beyond the physical. All of the media is teaching her something totally different. <br>  <br>  Holding her hand is o.k. <br>  <br>  You want to leave the thought with her that here is uncle BLANK a man that loves me and doesn't ask for anything in return, He is interested in what I think, doesn't run from my affection. <br>  <br>  "I Matter.."<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long but it's important.|`|9298mlxoaa	I think u need to confront your sister again. if she doesn't believe you, tell her you won't babysit again.|`|racnq84Vaa	You have to do the uncomfortable and sit down with your sister and tell her that your niece does not understand personal space.  And that you need her to talk with her daughter and have her stop with the touching as she is going to do that to some other man and he will take it sexually.  And then you will be babysitting your kid niece's baby.<br>  <br>  Young men and young women must be taught about boundaries.  She obviously has not been taught about touching others.  And, I suspect she needs father type attention and thinks this is the way to go about it.  It isn't and is only going to cause major problems in her life.  <br>  <br>  I know you probably do not want to have this conversation with your sister.  But you owe it to your niece to do so.  What question will you be asking later if you do not say anything and she ends up knocked up by a grown man?  Or kidnapped by a stranger that she is overly friendly and inappropriate with?  Or even worse when she is raped or murdered by some pedo who she plays touchy feely with?<br>  <br>  You are her uncle and know that she means nothing by it, they will look at her as a female.  A sexual being to be used and abused.  A needy teen who will do what they want for a little attention and affection.  Wrong, absolutely.  But it is reality.  So do her a favor and talk to your sister.|`|qCwgN2lLaa	you definetly need to say something if its making you feel this uncomfortable but remmeber she may not realise she is making you feel this way so tell her nicely shes 15 she will understand and appreciate that you spoke to her not her mam she propberly feel grown up and will act more like this if you use this approach hope it works out for you x|`|tF7z20wvaa	LMAO.... wow that's weiiirrddd. I think you should have a talk with her. Or talk to your sister again.
DCzSBPUjaa	I've known my NOW girlfriend for about 3 yrs. Right when I met her she had a boyfriend. So, I became really good friends with her and when she broke up with her boyfriend, I went out with her. So we have only been going out for less than a month.(I really didn't need to tell you this but all ladies like the details).<br>  <br>  Anyways, it's the other way around for me. I don't hang around my friends anymore. The only person I'm around and care about is my GF. I'm around her more than my own family. The ONLY thing I'm worried about right now is my relationship with her and my(our) future.<br>  <br>  Honestly I can't answer why he would rather be around his friends instead of you. If he was really in love with you, he would forget his friends and would put you first. I can say that you need to completely ignore him and he will get the picture and he SHOULD start acting right.
7wumH6kDaa	wow. she is a bonified b****.  Maybe she missed you and thats the way she says... er whatever you say when you missed someone. It might end soon. but if not then yeah that is a serious problem.
71VRvldJaa	Not at all!  Not when you really love someone.  After all, we don't get turned off when you get a beer belly, go bald and hair starts growing out your nose and ears!
VnK2sqcjaa	Don't call him anymore.  Wait for him to call you, that's how guys are.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	he has lost interest in you. i think its time for you to move on with you life don't think about the past the past means nothing its all about the future can you deal with how he is treating you is that fair to you. forget what he did in the past live in the here and now. move on and find someone better you gave him a chance. move on
AA10446930	Actually, not all the guys are like that. For sure, he(your ex) is a very "active" person whose sex drive was obviously too high for your standards. You see, men's sexual behavior are visually driven, that means to say that your boyfriend might always find you attractive all the time, and to be discreet to say about this, you make him horny whenever he sees you(because you might have a very nice figure). And I can't blame you, women's sex drive are driven by sensual touching so you must have made the least sexual intimacy with your ex that is why you are so inexperienced with sex. Many guys out there are natural born gentlemen, so you are sure to find a new partner that will at least make a "pleasant" sexual experience for you. A guy's true behavior will show in sex. A sadist will go for weird sex fetishes and I don't even know what's even weirder than that. But anyway, the point here is: you just have to find the right guy, know him more and find out who he really is and so when the time comes when you will both sleep together, you will not be surprised to find how he acts in bed, because you already know who he is. :)|`|cb7bdc5ff397b28d0e2312a0800253a8aa	take it easy,talk 2 him,what he likes n what u like,try sume things thats d only way of knowing what you like,most of all have fun thats half d trill sex,|`|gzBk5NMVaa	Go with a little older guy who has experience.

Don't lead him to the bed room an turn on the brakes, or stop at the door so it doesn't get to the bedroom!!! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!!|`|c6g92RRVaa	You will be lucky to find a guy who cares enough about you to even acknowledge you while he is pumping away.

IwXy8KLVaa	Hi-Hi :-)) i know what you mean because i am really lively and loud most of the time but i am really shy about telling a guy that i like him. Since you said she is shy but likes you i suggest you build on it with small things. Maybe try putting a note on the inside of her locker complimenting how she looked that day or saying i really like this about your personality.. It makes shy girls feel really special when people notice small things about them because it means that you are really looking at her personality and paying attention to her even thought she isn't going "HEY HEY ME OVER HERE". After making her notice that she is really special to you, promise her that she can trust you. Do some thing that you normally wouldn't to show her that the trust is equal and that you trust her just as much as she trust you. I hope this helps and best of luck ;-)|`|475ca662f051679937b7c94c642a9d64aa	Next time you see her, ask her if she would like to go out sometime, the worst she could say is no|`|8XKmMBU7aa	Please you need some one person, who may send her message that you love her. <br>  If you don't have any person, you will tell me her cell no. and e-mail address and I will send her message as well as make her phone call. <br>  I will tell her every thing about your Truly Love.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.<br>  Any one can add me in his/her contacts, So you may remained in my touch.|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Do something small and thoughtful, like having flowers delivered to her with a sweet note.|`|Cg5FJVd9aa	just bee tghe best boyfriendd. hold her handd, hugg herr! girls like when they feel lovedd, dont be embarresed by holding her handd girls like thatt, i know i doo!!!<br>  --kaylynn<br>  (bestt answerr please??)|`|3B1g8cVBaa	Make her like you :)|`|nNExPtAtaa	hmm...i think you should just get to know her a little more.earn her trust till she really loves you as a friend.<br>  if she doesnt want you as a boyfriend,then leave it.dont put pressure on her.however,if she does....then just wait till the end of a sentimental conversation,and then ask her out(if you want to).<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Wsudxcybaa	your fifteen, still in school, so i suggest you just be extra nice to her for the next few days! then, ask her out! dont go too fast! you will just scare her off, go ahead and be a great boyfriend, but also just be a great friend!|`|PfzYjPgsaa	Tell her that her new furniture looks great from her lawn|`|ThbicuDlaa	Get her by herself, tell her you like her :) simple yet effective ;) x|`|9MTJ5Ip0aa	Just chill out around her.

4S6V4sb4aa	If anyone 18 or over has sex with anyone 16 or younger. It is considered rape in the 3erd degree, statutory rape, sexual corruption of a minor.. etc. even if she says she wanted to and he didn't rape her. the state would bring those charges up on him.. and he could do anywhere from 2 to 5 years in prison..  Just the fact that the 15 yr old is his girlfriend is illegal,, that's called corruption of a minor and he can go to jail. sounds like he's playing with fire.. good luck|`|AA11108018	Well statutory rape good for three years in prison|`|QjRXjiF2aa	By "what would happen", do you mean like, legally?<br>  <br>  He could be accused of rape, regardless of whether there was consent, and face huge charges. 15 is a double minor.

But for most people things like mental maturity, etc can change things slightly.<br>  <br>  Now, here's where things get a little more legitimate. In certain jurisdictions, any contact with someone under the age of consent (usually 16 or 18) by someone over 18 that can be considered "sexual" is illegal and considered "statutory rape."

NW1oQMtGaa	I thought same personalities works best because they both understand each others needs.Understanding is the ultimate keystone of a relationship.For when you understand each other you will truly love and care for each other because you understand each other,because you see each other to one another as if both of you is seeing one self to one another as if you are really ONE FLESH AND UNITED AND ONE BEING.Is not it,the purpose of marriage is UNION OR BOTH OF YOU BECOME ONE FLESH?OR ONE BEING?<br>  <br>  Why seek a person who do not Understand you?!!!! Are you crazy then?<br>  <br>  You know the major reasons for break-ups is MISUNDERSTANDING!..they do not understand each other so they end up in disaster: hurting one another,slandering one another,become bitter,etc....<br>  <br>  You know WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THERE IS NO LOVE! BUT WHEN THERE IS UNDERSTANDING THERE IS LOVE AND TRUST AND FAITH.<br>  <br>  BUT IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER...oh...a disaster in the making..!<br>  <br>  Have you heard the term "irreconcilable differences" in almost opposite relationship when they reason out for their break -ups?<br>  <br>  Why look for someone who could not understand you?are you nuts?<br>  Anyone of us does not want to live or have a relationship with a stranger,don't you?
CR7arBmbaa	She seems to be doing everything right - I respect her caution and taking time with considering moving back in there, that can't be easy at all when your pregnant with his kid - meanwhile he seems to be doing everything wrong, saying he'll stop drinking but still doing so, saying he loves her but won't even recarpet the floor,  and he manages to say all this "sweetly".  <br>  <br>  It's actions not words that matter and your cousin is a very smart and strong woman to not want to raise children in that environment even though she loves him very much.<br>  <br>  I'm sure she loves him but she knows those kids come first and all he knows is that he comes first and HE wants a family.<br>  <br>  Well he'll be the father of that child no matter where your cousin lives so ....I don't know...just tell her to tell him that. That it's not necessary for them all to live together to be a family. That these children deserve a calm and stable environment because life is pretty damn hard enough as it is, and damn near impossible without at the very least a start like that.<br>  <br>  Yes, he definetly has problems, those kids are lucky to have a mom like her.|`|91mUZeSJaa	ok ill tell you something b4 i answer..<br>  <br>  my boyfriend was like that it was just a lil push so i ignored it n stayed..<br>  few months later b4 i knew it i was being beat every day every hour of the day for a year...and 1 night it even got as bad as he tried 2 murder me.so i left him..i was so inlove with him but now iv left him and moved on i feel so much better and im happy now i dont have to be scared every day.<br>  <br>  so excuse the language but<br>  SCREW HIM..<br>  <br>  there are alot more guys in the world that wil apreciate her..<br>  <br>  and as the saying goes..<br>  <br>  a guy worth your tears wont make you cry..<br>  <br>  hope that helps and i really hope she doesnt stay with him..<br>  for her sake and the little kids..they dont need 2 be around that..|`|AA10532171	She needs to give him the ultimatum!   The booze or me!?  You cannot have us both!  Maybe six months instead of a year of him proving himself<br>  <br>  I agree with Joe, at this point if this is going to work for them to be together, they need counseling.   They need premarital counseling.  He needs it for the drinking.  If he went to the doctors and the parenting classes with her.  Then she should go with him to alcohol counseling.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have a friend, she gave her husband that ultimatum before they were married.  It worked!  They have been happily married for over forty years!!  <br>  <br>  I have news for them and you.  ALL relationships have arguments!  But you work things out!   Unless it gets to the point beyond working out!  If the arguments turns physically or/and mentally abusive, then it is time to seek help.  Get counseling !  And if they won't counsel, or the counseling does not work, or you are in fear for your life, then it is time to get out!  And if it is just one of them that don't want to go, must be they figure the relationship is not worth working out or saving.<br>  <br>  I gave that ultimatum to my ex, a quite a few years into our marriage.  That is a long story, so will try to keep it short!  <br>  <br>  It seemed every time he'd drink, he'd get argumentative, loud, and would only correct the kids then, not when sober.  Then it got to him slapping things around him and me, not me.  A couple times he had grabbed me,or shoved, as if he were going to hit. So I gave him that ultimatum, the booze or me has to go!  It worked, for about 2 years worked, with the exception of an occasional beer.  Then it seemed his family and mostly his friends started having booze parties, and he got back into the hard stuff.  After a few months he started yelling even when sober, and more arguing when drunk.  He began with the slapping things again.  I asked him to go to counseling with me.  His reply, why? NO!  He didn't see anything wrong with our marriage.  So I figured if he didn't think our relationship was worth the time to save it, Then I am GONE!  LOL  <br>  <br>  He has since remarried, I have NOT!  We were married for 23 - 24 years, divorced for 7+ years!  There were so many good time too!  That what made it so hard to do, and was still emotionally draining!  Everything is fine now and back to being friends! And that is my short version??? Wow, I'd hate to type the long one!|`|rJPBF33taa	A- As crazy and "old fashioned" as this sounds...marriage before sex- that would solve the problem of kids without stable relationships.<br>  B- You are so sweet to help your cousin and worry about her...but once that line is crossed adn a mate becomes abusive- she will have to find a way to pull out of the situation with as little damage to the kids well being as possible.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|vuRYpPj2aa	When a woman has a child her #1 priority is that child. She has to be sure she's bringing these children into a stable environment where they can be comfortable and happy. I don't believe a single mother should be with another man until her children are grown. You can't bring men in and out of a child's life number one, and a single women with a little girl/boy is a bullseye for a child predator. She needs to be independent and be on her own and raise her children. Always choose your children's happiness and well-being over a man.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Your friend knew he drank before she made a baby with him, knew how he behaved when he drank and made a baby with him anyway.Sounds like SHE is trying to control him in a way too hon.<br>  Why is her  3 yr old's daddy no longer with her?<br>  sShe says "he can be a nice sweet loving guy at times but_____________",that;s like saying my german shepard can be so nice and sweet at times,but at other times bites me.<br>  She needs to have him to go to counseling with her,and they need a counselor to help them work through this.She needs to see to it that he will stay true to his word about not drinking for at least a year,If he can not do this for a year,she needs to  move on and have her tubes tied and stop dating, because she does not know how to pick a good man.If he has an alcohol problem it will take the LORD to deliver him from it.He has emotional problems which is why he drinks more than likely.<br>  If he does not really get help for it then he will go back to drinking eventually.Someone who has an alcohol problem and facing a split up will try everything to maintain having both the relationship andthe alcohol.

Would that wake her up?<br>  <br>  The situation you describe could be viewed as child abuse by your state's child protective services.  You might mention to your mom that all a neighbor has to do is report her continuing absence to all hours and your having basically to raise your sister and the two of you could become wards of the courts and in foster care.  Maybe that might wake her up.  You haven't threatened to report her; you've simply pointed out that someone else might, since this sounds like it's blatant enough for neighbors, teachers, etc. to see what is happening.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and hold on to your inner strength.  If anyone tells you it's only for a few years, that's small comfort and not anything that is helpful to you right now.

Why not agree to just date other people, and see him when he is in town? Just agree to not tell each other if you are with someone else.

What's good for your relationship long term is that he wants YOU to comfort him. He's coming to YOU for support. I'm not saying it's easy at all; however, when all this is said and done, you and he will be a hell of a lot closer than before. <br>  <br>  If he hates his job, help him search for a new one. If he's over 20 and not in school or something, i'd say his parents would be justified in being ready for him to start taking full responsibility for himself. (There's a whole lot of stuff that has to be taken into account for that though). As for the self-esteem/self-image issues, continue to reassure him that you find him irresistibly hot. Compliment him even when he's not looking for that reassurance. Don't overdo it though; that will just make him feel like you're just saying it to keep him quiet. <br>  <br>  DO NOT bring up the fact that he's depressed in direct conversation with him. Let him bring it up. Just ask regular stuff (how his day went, how was work, have things improved at work etc). Bring it up will make him dwell on it instead of trying to change things and make it better.<br>  <br>  As for you, just be patient. You may as well relax now if you intend to be there for him. This could take awhile. If it persists even after a job change etc, he may want to seek professional help. For now, just make sure it's not a phase he's going through.
8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	he is jealous and wants to be the only guy in your life but he doesn't want you too be the only girl in his. he wants more options but doesn't want you to have them. its not fair but i've seen stuff like this a lot|`|d36OrpbDaa	well, if he's your good friend, don't make him jealous by talking about other guys.  save that for other friends.  if he doesn't wanna hear it, why make him jealous by talking about it?  you have other friends you can say that stuff to!  you don't have to spill it to everybody.|`|7uTFVEyDaa	FYI: Guys don't want it when Girls talk about OTHER GUYS.. unless he is gay. So don't wonder why the guy wouldn't want to hear you when your talking about your dates.<br>  <br>  If both of you are scared of commitments then why should you bother if he doesn't care?|`|lPJSF3vRaa	Why do you want to talk about dates if not to see if it makes him jealous, friends just have sex and then talk about other guys, he has got it all  you are not his friend you are his tart|`|b0Q6ecqzaa	yeah, he likes you.  when you talk about other guys, he gets jealous.  it's a perfectly natural reaction on his part.<br>  <br>  he doesn't want to date you, because he likes you so much, he's afraid of losing you.  he knows that he will never lose you if you just stay friends...unless it's to a new boyfriend.<br>  <br>  if you start dating someone, he'll feel that he needs to make his move or risk losing someone he cares a great deal for.  but when you're not dating someone else, his best angle is as a friend.<br>  <br>  bottom line:  try to convince him that dating each other won't ruin your relationship.  establish up front that if it doesn't work out, you'd always love to be friends.  but you know that you each have feelings for one another, so you owe it to yourselves to explore that closeness.  if it doesn't work out, then things will go back to how they are now.  if it does work out, then you'll both be incredibly happy for a very long time.  he's got a lot to gain, and nothing to lose.<br>  <br>  it's basically that, or just keep the status quo, and being weird friends with a lot of drama.
rev03i9saa	sorry, but it's only natural. There isn't much you can do about it.<br>  Except, of course, think of something totally NON-arousing when looking at a girls' cleavage.<br>  Hope I helped<br>  xx|`|eJwAZEyZaa	you cant do it my friend , its male instinct.|`|HxXduL1maa	Evolution has geared men to look for boobs and arouse. <br>  For the rest, men find a woman with long neck and boobs more appealing. Long necks signify gender difference, while boobs indicates good health and so potential to arouse.<br>  Coming to body shape, a man's ideal for women is a waist-hip ratio of about 70 per cent - and this ratio is actually an indicator of high fertility in a woman. All men love breasts and cleavage, and find a rounded, protruding behind attractive - a symbol of fertility since time immemorial. So, ok, with a man, looks do matter. And how! To the extent that over time, women's bodies have evolved as sexual signals to beckon men!<br>  <br>  Men, however, draw a straight correlation between the amount of effort women take with their boobs appearance and their interest in them. As a result, if somewhere along the line a woman stops looking after booobs, a man sees it as a signal that he is no longer important to her!<br>  And so, just like a man must never stop complimenting a woman, a woman must always look-after her boobs for  man's sake. <br>  <br>  So if u see them there is nothing wrong in it|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	it is a normal thing. but try not to make girls notice this because it is not good and may misunderstand you|`|iBH7NTl3aa	I wish I went to your school!|`|RD0yaJlgaa	because you always feel like you want to touch them|`|StqBr5XRaa	give it Time you will learn to love them too|`|zQSnNBj1aa	too bad mut u cant get rid of that it will be with you for ever<br>  <br>  jokes<br>  <br>  do you have a GF if you do talk to her about it and ask her if she can help you get desensitized to it by maby showing u some titties or bending over in front of you so she has a cleavage|`|Wsudxcybaa	dude, you can do it, it really creeps girls out when they see guys looking at them, i would suggest you think. hard. do you really want to stop? then you can do it! when you see a girl that is about to bend over, look away. you are a man! you cant be that weak! save it for when you do find the right girl!|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Man is always attracted to breasts, i don't know why but, i love them very much.  <br>  You can't ignore them, i tried but i always peak, but now i am now trying to look once then let it go.<br>  Don't worry about it, its completely natural.|`|Q4fOTUNNaa	It is't a bad habit, it's quite natural at the age of 17.

ownoc1ZJaa	I'm surprised the bride chose her as maid of honor, since she is so awful.  I would speak to the bride directly about it - she needs to step up and nip this in the bud.  It's her wedding, after all.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Your question asks about etiquette. Its not your place to not invite her, or exclude her. The bride chose her, and it is for the bride to decide how to deal with this girl-- or not. You may be a bridesmaid and have the brides best interest at heart, but be careful about butting into this problem. Its between the maid of honor and the bride, not you.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	I wouldn't invite this b***h under any circumstance. She is probably jealous of you planning the party or is just a mindless b***h. Why is she the maid of honor? She obviously has no honor.|`|zNuZm4K6aa	What you should do is ask the bride her feelings about it.  If the bride is still keeping her as maid of honor, then unfortunately, you should invite her.  This is really the bride's call and her decision to make.  <br>  <br>  Think about it like this too.  What if you didn't invite her, then she & the bride started getting along great.  The bride might blame you for not having her maid of honor at the bachelorette party.  You wouldn't want to be on the bad end of this.<br>  <br>  Ask the bride if she is keeping her as her moh, if she says yes, then tell her that you feel like you have to invite her to the party under those circumstances.  If the bride doesn't have enough backbone to kick her out of the wedding party, that is on her,not you.|`|OEYy1TY8aa	That's a very tough situation. Although she is being a major b****, she is the maid of honor for a reason. If you don't invite her, that's definitely going to cause some major drama. How is the bride going to feel if her wedding party is cold/angry with each other on her day? <br>  <br>  I think you have every right to be upset, and you should definitely tell her something, but I honestly think you're going to have to be the bigger person here and at least invite her. If she chooses not to go, it's her problem then. I know it sucks...but I think you should definitely consider the brides feelings.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out!

Especially because we've made out and gone through of that girlfriend, boyfriend stuff.<br>  <br>  It may be different for you, but sometimes I regret going out with him. We never hang out anymore like friends, when we try to something always happens and we end up getting back together.<br>  <br>  Make sure you really like him, because if your still confused about your feelings for him, I'd wait... unless your sure that you do really like him.<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	I actually have had a relationship like this before.

I guess sit her down and try to make it appalling to her. Roll playing is fun., She put on your tighty whities and you break out of the closet, Victory's Closet that is.Have fun with sex. With to adult consenting adults of course. Break out the prada ,gl and the toys and have a ball (so to speak) .

Or put them on after you have sex.. my husband put my underwear on once after sex and it was hilarious. :) If she thinks it's weird, just sit her down and explain to her that you just wanted to know what they felt like. *shrugs*<br>  <br>  Or just ask her, plainly, "Would it be alright with you if I tried on your pantyhose? I'm curious to know what they feel like!" Good luck!|`|qGiFTnC2aa	I reckon put them on and parade around like it's a joke. My husband's done that a few times to give me a laugh.<br>  <br>  Seriously, we've done some weird stuff. I've dressed up as a cheerleader...and a nun.  He's worn a big bear suit.<br>  <br>  If you just want the sensation then try them on when she's not around. If you think you want to start doing it regularly then you'll need to count her in. If my husband was into it I couldn't care less. It's harmless (unless you're stretching and ruining her best knickers lol).  You haven't got some sick fetish that might hurt someone.<br>  <br>  And guess what? Lots of guys do, or want to do the same thing.

Maybe try dressing younger?learn some youngin lingo?drive a nice car? pretend not to be smarter than the man your with?Most men can;t stand to be with a chick that is equal or smarter than them.(it hurts their pride and will ruin your social status in public places).there is a start.|`|AA11305351	Don't you believe for a minute that younger guys wouldn't wan to go out with you. I know a lot of young guys that LOVE older women. The next time a young guy flirts with you, respond favorably, and you'll see what I'm talking about. As for guys your age wanting younger women, that's also not correct. You are in the prime of life right now. Put on something sexy tonight and go out.......you'll have guys all over you, of all ages.

Since my divorce, I have found an attraction to older women, I think its because they know what they want and they don't play games.  The guys that you are meeting are just looking for flings, they aren't looking for a true relationship anyway, you're probably better off if they aren't interested.. ... plus, older women make good lovers!!!!!|`|AA12130990	Young body is attractive candy, yeah!

I have friends that definitely like to date older women maybe your not meeting them in the right place.|`|AA11960924	Hi....I'm 42 and I believe that most men go for younger girls to make them feel younger. A girl is more apt to believe the lies and is more impressionable than a woman closer to his own age. Younger girls havent experienced the things an older woman has, so therfore..she wouldnt necessarily know the tricks and lies of a man. But I think mostly..its about his ego........makes him look like the stud to his friends....and your right....20 some year olds do like going out with older women.....almost for the same sort of reasons. They can learn and experiment with someone who isnt afraid to let go and be themselves. If your comfortable with it...then go for it......you deserve to feel good about yourself too.|`|AA11568057	Get out there and go for it.You may be surprised how many of the young ones are willing to take a few lessons!.Men will always look at sexy,young women,It's just natural.Most older women will look at younger men in exactly the same way.Just do it!!.
6348771ae33e1bafc3de41b65ba1555baa	I think that when you finally find that special someone, you'll just know.  You won't have to wonder.  Love isn't perfect, but when you're with that certain someone, your soulmate, everything will suddenly make sense in life, and everything will seem as though it couldn't possibly get any better.  You'll just know!|`|1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	Talk to them - keep talking to them - spend time with them and get to know them.

Ask people who have been married for a long time. Hard work, sacrifice, and comprimise is what it takes. Why do you think there are so many divorces? When the warm fuzzies go away the fairy tale goes with them. So I say  find or be on the look out for people who are similar to you and yet you and that person also compliment each other. Then the two of you sit down and be as clear as possible about your expectations. You both have to be as honest as possible and then decide if the two of you can stand each others faults as well as the strengths.|`|fb3294bdd51a15b5450b822af3829c48aa	we gamble with life

If your husband doesn't support what you want to with your life then leave him. <br>  <br>  Tell him if he is not going to offer you the same support as you give him then you are going to leave.<br>  <br>  There are men out there that would love a working wife. A woman with dreams and goals and ambitions of her own.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	if my husband told me to not work i would laugh in his face. it's not about the money, it's about me doing something.  i would not be stuck at home all day.  i don't care.  he would have to divorce me if he doesn't want to deal with it, cuz i would have a hell of an attitude after being bored all day in the house.  and that's how i am anyway, i am extremely independent and i don't depend on anyone.  <br>  <br>  but if it was about being a provider for the family, i don't have a problem not making money, i would just volunteer at a library or something.  i just don't want to be stuck at the house watching my life pass me by.|`|AA12213910	He loves you, and don't want u to be overtired.|`|9c86f6c921133bcdb8c1cef9c59bca7caa	He "allowed" you go to work? There is the problem. I don't know where you live, but most of modern society has begun to accept the fact that women are equal. Being married to him does not mean he owns you. You are not a cow or a slave, unless you want to be.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he wants to control you. As long as you went along with everything, he was fine. Now that you are a bit more independent, he does not like that.<br>  <br>  Get some marriage counseling. If he won't agree to it, you are in more trouble than you think. <br>  <br>  Talk to a counselor. Talk to a trusted female friend when he is not looking. Get some feedback. If you don't have any friends, look back over time. Did you use to have some friends? Have they all gone away? Why did they leave? Does he not like you to talk to your friends and/or family? That usually goes right along with not wanting the woman to work.<br>  <br>  Are there children involved? <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11634352	You need to divorce and FAST.  My soon to be ex was this way, and it only got worse.  He then moved on to neglecting the children and I, he moved onto abusing me, all with the knowledge that I couldn't easily leave him becuase I had no money to do so.  If he is cold now that you are using your legal right to work, imagine how much colder he wold be if you did as you chose with your money and your life.  "Allowed"???  Honey, I'm a muslim woman, and the only one's permission I need to work is ALlah's, the one true GOD.  GOD gave women rights, NOT men.  We don't need to get any permission from a man to do what God already made lawful.  This is only going to get worse.  My husband acted the same way as well when I refused to let him keep me down and keep me from pursuing education.  Pursuing education also got me a job becuase one class was internship.  He knew he had lost his power over me when he attacked me one day and I knocked a disc to his side out of his spine.  The abuse will only get worse.  PLease listen to a woman who has been there already.  Don't have children with this overgrown child.  He is only interested in his own things, and completely self absorbed.  A real man can handle his wife being happy with work, only an overgrown child would act this way by throwing temper tantrums and giving you the cold shoulder.  PLEASE leave him.  Don't waste 5 years of your life like I did.|`|cb5c944051ad3a3f2ad7115d43e319dfaa	Your husband is insecure,and figures if you get a job you will find another man and leave him.|`|f3309a0e8d010cddebf66ca3b7b4881caa	Lots of women will tell you "oh, your husband should not be like that", but if this is how he feels, it will probably be the best to do what he wants and not be grumpy about it, unless you want to get a divorce. Yes, maybe he is not right, but if you love him and want the relationship to work, be smart and let him (feel like he) win, then use your feminine wisdom to find a way that you can be active (work) without officially working. This means; stop working, let him earn the money and officially take care of his family and feel like a man, then you find some activity; volunteer work, exercise, hobby group, meet other women in the same situation; whatever you'd like, and do that! If you start competing and complaining, he will only recent you. Don't think about who is right, but what will gain you. Good luck!|`|AA11043567	your husband my come from a family that believes women shouldnt work, not because he doesn't love you but because he may feel he is no longer the bread winner.

You have a long road ahead, and it's likely other guys will come along- so try not to take this relationship too seriously.

Mas n?o apresse algo que você n?o está madura para tanto. O fato de você perguntar opini?es já demonstra o quanto está insegura. O fato de os pais dele querer apressar este relacionamento, deve ser analisado com cautela. Muitos pais fazem isto para garantir que os filhos tenham uma vida segura, que n?o fiquem por aí se envolvendo com pessoas do mal, ou até mesmo com drogas. Você pode continuar com ele, sem precisar casar já.  Permane?am cada um em suas casas e continuem conhecendo-se cada vez mais. Tenham sempre conversas abertas.

You are not a loser for loving him. He is the one that is messing up here. You are forced to walk on eggshells about how you feel or be forced to lose him. I think maybe he needs a second of clarity because what is happening isn't healthy. What he's doing is hurting you. Hes saying how he may or may not feel in a safe way-over the msn there. He may actually like you alot-which makes sense logically, you guys are friends. But in order to begin something worthwhile-why is the friendship being used as a chain?<br>  <br>  Honestly I think he may be on the fence or confused about what to do-or he doesn't want to do anything really which is confusing. Because if you feel this way and care for each other why are things still stuck on the same level? I get that friendship is very valuable-but isn't friendship supposed to be open and honest? I think because he rejected you-that messed things up cuz now you already feel that if you express yourself again he'll shoot you down. Well my only advice is how hard your willing to fight for yourself and the relationships and people in those relationships you care about. I advise alot of patience and backbone.<br>  <br>  Some changes are going to have to be made if you ever want to get out of this cycle or level of 'friendship'. Back off from him-tell him you need some space. Hang with your other friends or take time out for yourself. Forget him for awhile. As wrong as this may seem-your getting insecure because he's already got you worried over how he feels and expresses himself which is keeping you from expressing yourself freely. This is wrong. Any relationship is give and take. Don't sacrifice yourself or break your back because your afraid of losing him. Yes that is a rational fear-but don't let it stop you. That will only hurt more, and things may escalate and get blown out of proportion-you may grow sick of this after awhile simply because it is making you sick. I mean what if he gets a gf?-Like when you had a bf?-This would not be ideal to say the least. Back off-let him know that he's the one pushing you away. If he wants you then he needs to let you know-if its friendship, then no confusing hidden hints that can/could be misunderstood. If its more-then he and you shouldnt be so afraid and think it would ruin the friendship. If anything it should make things stronger. Way things are now-the friendship itself is suffering. And no, it is not your fault or his. You both are trying to handle things best you can.<br>  <br>  I really hope the friendship doesn't get put on the rocks because he can't make a stand-and you can't because he can't. Again my advice back off after trying to tell him that he is the one pushing you away so if he's so afraid of ruining the friendship he should try and tell you that how you feel is mutual but that hes scared. If thats the case-then realize his and yours fears-rational-but are keeping you from something you want, which is eachother.<br>  <br>  Hope That Helps!<br>  Good LUCK!!!!<br>  <br>  (Oh I don't answer for points that is retarted because ur answer is selfish and self rewarding. Thats why I only answer people who really seem like they need some help. Nice to know you feel the same way though!)|`|9Wg0W72oaa	I don't know him all that well but from what i can tell i think he does really love you. Some guys may act like they're tough but when it comes to realationships they are timid. I think that he may just be afraid that he'll do something wrong and loose you again. Guys are very simple minded we don't plan things out we just do them so don't think too far into this i'm sure it will all work out for you. Try sayin you love him when you are together and see how he reacts.<br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT A LOSER! ok? ok.<br>  Couples are usually best friends so its normal to love your best friend.<br>  <br>  I hope it gets better!|`|b36e4e97ffcfd1ea245a0588271a1f72aa	I think you should be straight with him and tell him like you wrote it here. You really like him, you want a relationship with him, you are willing to risk your friendship to be with him. If he says no again, I think you should distance yourself from him and tell him to stop saying he loves you and cuddling you because it's making it hard on you. He will either respect you for being honest or realise what he's going to be missing out on. Just don't put it on a plate it he wont be with you properly.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	He may not wont you to have a boyfriend because he wants you to be really close to him but maybe he wont tell you that he loves you because he doesnt want to risk the friendship.|`|AA11080047	well just carry on as you are. till you both really fall in love.your still very young. and what you say about him. he seems to me  to be a very nice person. so take one step as a time. good luck.|`|mLSZ3YsWaa	Oh my good you,only 16.<br>  <br>  well well girl you have a lot to learn,love and been a looser.<br>  <br>  I suggest you enjoy whatever you are up to.<br>  <br>  Oh one more thing buys are after sex after all other ways he would be gay want he?????????<br>  <br>  All the best young girl,and stop waisting your time on asking questions,that you will learn in life,just a mater of time.|`|9m2Pma4Saa	idk what msn is but u need to leave him alone . he's playing with your mind. dont fuc with him girl . men like playing those "i got her wrapped around my finger" games. girl find another cuddie buddie. their is so many men out there that you can have fun with.dont waste ur time!|`|O7BZUhNWaa	completely lost you on the 2nd paragraph<br>  |`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	no offense,<br>  but i think he's just saying that so you'll have sex with him.
AA10378030	Stop leading her around and tell her the truth!!! Then maybe she can move on with her life after getting over YOU and she can find someone who WLL love her in return. The poor girl!!!!!!!|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Tell her how you are feeling toward her, and you don't know if getting back together will work.|`|XYBdHhZRaa	Attraction isn't everything. Love sometimes isn't explainable. You have to be the one to make this decision. Just know that you'll break her heart if you break up with her again after taking her back. Think hard about it before you decide.<br>  <br>  If you don't really love her though, you owe it to her to be honest.|`|WqGA5pTIaa	give it some time you will have to get use to living in the place as her and u think ur not attracted to her but ur just thinking to much about her moving in, ease up and let life control it all dont worry about wat might happen just worry about how u truely feel and follow it through everything good luck dude|`|56aupEoPaa	You're a jerk. Dragging her back, making her move, and for what? Just so can break her heart again. You don't deserve a girlfriend.|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	Uhm, just be honest with her.<br>  It's better to be honest now and clear with her,<br>  so if that's the case,<br>  she can get closure on this.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	you really don't love her so get rid of her|`|333W9jeCaa	I don't think that you should stay with someone that you are fully & wholeheartedly connected to. This could cause alot of bitterness if u stayed with her to please her & make her happy just b/c she loves you. Of course this will break her heart, but better now then later. But another question would have to be, what made u get back together & ask her to live with you again? What made you think you wanted to marry her? best advice I can give you is to pray & ask God which is the best decision. be blessed.|`|2a81ecfec6d8612c83138da585b77f05aa	Tell her how you feel cause if you don't shes gonna realize it in you wouldn't want her to misinterpret the way you feel so tell her before she comes to you and make a big deal out of it but most of all be a damn man and be honest with her and yourself |`|rHXFPGszaa	You have issuess that have nothing to do with her. And because of these issuess she is going to get hurt by you. You sir are what gives us good guys a bad name. break up with her for good and fix yourself.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	If you do not love her in any way, you need to break up. Nothing worst than hanging onto person hoping that if she is happy you will be too someday. That is how cheating/divorces happen.|`|6R6m9g6saa	Here's what I did in that situation...I married her!<br>  <br>  Come on in, the waters fine!|`|AA10860000	Move out it's the right thing to do.|`|1df40575e5486d1954461f0a3af0ad52aa	well either you have feelings for her or not. I mean its not like kinda or maybe its either no feeling or some to alot so there are only two side. Now the one side will vary how much feelings do you have for her? You can't lead this girl on you need to be honest with her! You can't drag her through this false relationship thats just going to be bad for her. Im not saying kick her out right now. Let it graduly end give her option to move out if you don't love her like you used to. Maybe having her move in was a big step past what you should have been done when you got back together, loving someone for loving you doesn't should like your loving her for the right reasons. Don't hurt this girl!|`|p19NwQkSaa	Here's one thing to think about. Once you leave her this time, you may never get her back again. This is a decision that may affect you for the rest of your life, but if you don't feel the same, then don't force yourself to stay in it. You've only been living with her for about 2 months..? Maybe all you need is more time together; romantic nights out, exciting moments together, etc. For now, just give it all time and see where it takes you because the last thing you would want to do is regret the decision you made. Another suggestion is to sit down with her and talk about things. Talk about the mistakes you two made last time and try to rekindle the flame. Perhaps, you will fall deeply in love with her again. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|bTuZSGi9aa	Same thing happened to me and my ex we lived together for 2 years then broke up for 7 months and then went back for 5 months our intention was to get married as well. After all I realized what you realized.SO I decided to stop it even though it hurted her and me now is been a year We cut all type of communication between each other it helped a lot to talk to friends girls specially. If I was you I would drop it asap.|`|cpDkeolKaa	You're being completely unfair on her. You have your own problems and need to get them sorted out don't drag her into your life. Break up with her, it's better than giving her false hope. I feel sorry for your girlfriend.

It's as simple as that. 
0u6qy9Uuaa	YOU had the party - YOU are responsible - that's life - grow up and deal with the consequences. I hope they make you pay for any damages too. - Sounds like you're too young to be partying in hotels anyway if your parents are getting involved.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	well dont have the party if you cant handle it <br>  deal with the consequences i spose|`|hIrBZS3oaa	That sucks :-( <br>  You can either stick it out and just have a quiet night.  Watch a movie or something to get your mind off the party.  <br>  or<br>  you can defy them and go to the party anyways<br>  or<br>  you can try talking to them again and say that yelling at you isn't the mature way to handle punishment.  That name calling etc. is unacceptable behavior and it really hurt your feelings.  They may not change their mind but it will definitely throw them off track at how maturing you can speak to them.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	You only have yourself to blame - if you can't invite sensible guests, or make sure those guests bring sensible friends, as the host, you are ultimately going to be blamed for the outcome of the party. Your parents are right to blame you for not being able to control them. I don't know what you expected out of a teenage party, but you must've seen films where homes get trashed when the kids are left home alone, & behaved more responsibly.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	If you have a party, you have to be able to accept the concequences. You know if someone leaves a party hosted by you, and they're driving drunk, and hit someone and kill them, you can be charged with murder? <br>  You're responsible for allowing it to happen. If you don't want to deal with it, you shouldn't let people in, or know when to help when things get out of hand. <br>  <br>  I would likely do the same and your dad (depending on how long ago this was)... to be honest. <br>  <br>  Even if it WAS your friends it was YOUR party. You have to know that (not just by them, but legally), if you host a party, your responsible for anything that happens there. If you can't control it (even though you tried),  you shouldnt have had the party. <br>  We throw parties in our house and we always make sure to take the precautions of putting everything away that could get broken or stolen, invite people we trust to help us take care of trouble makers, and HONESTLY know things are going to go wrong that we are going to have to fix. <br>  I<br>  <br>  Sorry, but thats how it is!|`|ZaMzRSrraa	punishment fits the crime here!|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	well the fact is you still had a hotel party.<br>  and whether it was or wasn't your fault,<br>  you were there and you deserve some of the blame.<br>  you could have stopped it or you could have left.<br>  but you didn't,<br>  so you should accept your punishment.<br>  some things aren't fair,<br>  and you should learn to accept that.<br>  but as far as the grounding goes,<br>  that is kind of your fault too.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Sorry hun, but if your parents have put the foot down then theres really no point in thinking what if and all that.... you cant go. You had a party and you now have to suffer the consequences... Im a bit confused as to how ye got love bites if there were no guys there though!!! lol!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|6ea4gewSaa	I know it seems like a big deal when your a teen, but you do deserve to be punished for that(even if you don't think it was your fault it was your party). Just remember that next time. Listen to your dad. There will be other parties to ge to.=)|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Oh wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You're actually crying because you can't go to a party. Maybe some other interests would do you well.|`|ZsuH4UrEaa	what u have to do is deal with it if u cant go u cant go just let ur parents calm down if u keep asking there just gonna remember<br>  ur perhaps better off not going tonight|`|2qFRNztBaa	WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ROOMS?!|`|4EWCegiRaa	Why didn't you leave the wild hotel party if it was out-of-hand?  What if they rape someone at the next party (heaven forbid), are you just going to stay there, watch, and then claim you shouldn't get in any trouble?<br>  <br>  Until you learn how to take responsibility WITHOUT MAKING EXCUSES (that's what you did), you should not be allowed to go.  You can't be trusted, you have to earn it.  The sooner you learn what choices you're making and how learn to deal with the consequences, I think your parents are right.<br>  <br>  PS- Crying and pouting isn't going to show your parents your mature or ready for anything.|`|apbuHIJOaa	You deserved to be shouted at. Like anything, the people you associate yourself with have a reflection on you. Even if it was your mates who were at fault, you still chose to associate yourself with those people.<br>  <br>  You have to learn that actions have consequences, and they're not always positive. Think before you act, it'll keep you out of trouble.<br>  <br>  I agree with JB, maybe it's time you stop trying to do what everyone else is doing and be an individual. I'm sure you have a great head on your shoulders, you just need to learn how to use it for good.<br>  <br>  I do think your parents deserve an apology. It'll show you're mature enough to accept the consequences of your actions and will likely be a plus in their books.|`|960718a65e6b04b9f71e09c3e143472faa	It's your fault for having the hotel party, you can't put the blame on your friends, if it went out of hand, you should have asked them to leave, or make up an excuse. <br>  <br>  You're parents obviously were disappointed in your behaviour and you just have to deal with the punishment now, it's not the end of the world.<br>  <br>  It's easy to blame it on other people, just deal with the consequences, and if you show your parents you're not bothered, it'll make you look better instead of crying about it.|`|V7Hx50Pqaa	i think it was irrisponsible to have a party t a hotel and let it get out of hand so you have to understand where your dad is coming from.when you are older you will realise it was all for your own good im speaking from personal experience as i am only 19 and now realise that all the punishments i got were for my own good they are just looking out for you.plus the fact that your crying because you cant go to a party shows how immature you are.sorry its just the truth|`|OnkStkY1aa	Since it was your hotel party you should have tried to keep your friends under control i understand why your dad is saying no. Even tho you think that this is very unfair i think its prolly best that you dont go and sit there and try to show your dad that your responsible and do stuff to help out around the house. Good luck. |`|nq9ZSHXraa	Well you could sneak out, come home and maybe get an even worse punishment...<br>  <br>  Or..<br>  <br>  You could deal with the consequences and learn from your mistakes.<br>  <br>  You had the party in the first place so if you didnt do anything you still have a part of the blame |`|CcHkZehoaa	I would ask your dad what you could do to make up what "you did" so your punishment could be over sooner|`|AA10483654	Your parents just want you to realize that excuses don't relieve you from responsibility; whoever rented the room or sponsored the event is responsible no matter what they personally did or didn't do. It's probably true that you couldn't control the behavior of such a large group of people. The life lesson here is, don't throw gatherings for groups larger than you can reasonably control because when things get damaged or broken, "I'm sorries" and "it wasn't my faults" don't pay for them or replace them. Captains of ships aren't always at the helm when the ship is at sea; sometimes the first officer or other sailors are steering the craft, but if they run into something, the captain is STILL responsible and on the hook for whatever occurs within his command. I know this is a hard lesson to swallow, but it's important to learn this now before the stakes get any higher. Under the circumstances, the punishment is appropriate which means your father probably won't change his mind about this party. The bigger picture plays like this: at least your parents love you enough to set reasonable boundaries for you...it may not feel like it right now, but that's a good thing. Next time try much smaller groups or ask everyone to contribute deposits. People are less likely to tear things up if they personally have to pay for things when they're damaged. Have a nice day.

Good luck!!|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	uhm, well it's common really.<br>  it'll pass.|`|1yxken2Saa	maybe explain to him your getting upset and figure out how<br>  |`|7e4076060b1fd97619bd53c99e4ca187aa	Sounds like he doesnt keep you interested. Or that you can walk all over him and he wont do anything about it... Either way,, you sound like a ******|`|hJ5lQXehaa	It means you're a girl every chick out there does that no offense.|`|OFcUWMCZaa	dont tlk to him lol|`|YHNAPmtlaa	keep your phone conversations short. and if you get that way talking to him face to face you should end the relationship.|`|8D8B9KfXaa	if he makes you feel upset than its not worth it.... just hang in there and tell him the truth!<br>  <br>  not right for you girll! :)<br>  |`|1bX7kVXDaa	Forget him.  Move on.  There is no future here unless you want to be upset for the rest of your days.|`|NXh1Lr8Raa	okay grrl, its okay. Just make him a sammich and it'll be okay.|`|xSotrUxzaa	go over the con vo and figure out y its like the scientific method
AA11799523	There could be several reasons why he did not give you a straight answer, i.e.  He was caught off-guard, He is shy and was embarrassed, He believes that the guy should do the asking, He is involved with someone else,  He is interested in someone else, or, unfortunately, He is just not interested in you.  There's no real way to know but the fact is that you have made your interest known to him, so give him a little time.  The next move is his, and if he likes you, he'll be back around.|`|KHaJgRVXaa	Tell the dude straight up, i need a yes or no answer, you didnt answer my question earlier, and i was a bit confused, so just wondering,<br>  <br>  most guys dont realize they do that unless their players. <br>  <br>  or you can just ask him what his plans are for tonight, thats easy, but also tip toeing around the situation too|`|CPcKAKmxaa	what did he say exactly?<br>  was he smiling, looking at you or not?<br>  is he shy or not?<br>  were you cool while asking him or nervous?<br>  All this is necesarry info to give you an answer.<br>  <br>  One thing you should know- if he saw you nervous, he might have thought you dont really like him, and asking only from obligation- and turn you down inspite of wanting to be with you.|`|BiD2qmPuaa	try to be casual, but ask him something like "hey so i'm a little confused about what you said the other day, would you like to go out?" and if his answer is the same or just as cryptic, then he's probably trying to be a nice guy and not hurt your feelings.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	How did the conversation go?  I'd need to know what was said to really give you an answer, but my hunch is he was trying to let you down easy.|`|AA11100890	It would have helped if you told us what he said.  I'd drop it unless he brings it up again.  Unless he said yes, or maybe next week, the answer was no.  |`|t5X3cfJMaa	You messed up when you asked him !!!! if he wanted to go wit hyou  on a date then he would have asked you |`|Dg6PeZBCaa	find a more decisive guy.|`|9KZmvHFaaa	Ask if he's busy. If he makes something up then its a no...if he says he  wants to go with you but cant...he might be lying. but if he says he had plans but will put them off..well you know|`|oEvIehiFaa	Ask him.|`|Rb087BsAaa	if he didn't give you a direct answer, then he is just sparing your feelings.  It's pretty obvious.|`|mPSTNmPSaa	Why don't you tell us what he said, maybe a guy can decode it for you? Look if he gave you an answer you have to ask more questions about, he said no. If a guy likes a girl and wants to go out, he makes sure she understands yes. Sorry hun. You don't need a jerk that can't give you a straight answer anyways!!! Good Luck!|`|iXt3erseaa	Say to him: "Hey, my date offer still stands - if you are interested, today or any other day, let me know!" and leave it with him.|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	uhm, just tell him you missunderstood the answer.|`|vcjPx1WRaa	What did he say when you asked him?|`|neNfeluIaa	If he did not say "yes", I'd leave it alone.  Let him approach you this time if he is interested.
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, you must go to his job or place were he works,or some where were you can be alone with him.ask him to be honest to you,so you can sort your life out and move on if that's what he wants you to do..ask him if he has any feelings for you.and is he happy with his life without you.tell him you have got to know were you stand.that is the only way you will know if there is a Futur for the pair of you.good luck.|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	i don't think he wants anything to do with you.<br>  sorry, but it seems that way.|`|wMpVBjo9aa	I dont think you will ever know unless he tells you quite clearly, but if he is planning his future with someone else then im afraid he wants to be with her. i know its hard (im going thru a similar situation) and you so think 'i know he still likes me' and maybe he does! but its also denial, im convinced this guy still likes me yet he hasnt been in contact, so thats me just hoping! maybe your situation is different but dont wait around, thats one thing i learnt, if he has why shouldnt you!! <br>  <br>  i hope you get this sorted!! 
Q4D5T5vwaa	yes, i've wanted to mess up my **** dad for years. i have been on the brink of suicide many times because of him & all the abuse he's done to my mom and i, yet i've never gone thru with it. i wish i was living in texas... where you mentioned that it's the law that if you feel threatened, you could take action. i wish maryland was like that. <br>  <br>  anyway... if you believe socking him out will make you feel better, then go for it. i've dealt with so many people like the one ur dealing with, i simply don't care anymore. i've told some to go kill themselves under my breath. if they have i wouldn't know, cause i don't talk to them anymore anyway. i've also had urges like you, & i too have never acted out either. it does get tempting, but i control myself.<br>  <br>  It's his karma that's making him treat you that way. and the way you react is yours. if you think it's right, go for it, if not, just ignore him as best you can.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No.  Let it go.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	No.|`|3swZV9uUaa	DO NOT FIGHT HIM JUST LET IT GO IGNORE HIM AND DONT HAND AROUND WITH HIM ANYMORE|`|68CpnNplaa	ooh beat the crap out of him. lol not kidding tho he deserves it wat an ***...|`|quPY9x7qaa	like most idiots if you ignore this one it should just go away, hopefully your brother has better sense than believe anything this moron told him after the trouble he got him in before. If you are intent on getting back at this guy some way some how I'd suggest pinning up posters around saying he's in love with his dog, or if you have the computer skills, show pics...  you had the best idea to begin with, if he comes around sic the law on him, they don't care how tough he thinks he is.|`|FjqJs7gMaa	No, man its in the past. Live for the now, you should have better things to worry about. We still in a recessional state of being.|`|zwpJCdrJaa	To be honest i wouldn't be sure what to do. I have felt that way about someone, but i let it go and we became acquaintances. This guy does sound annoying but if you let it go then he can't touch you. It sounds like he wants to provoke you. So don't give him what he wants. Don't think about it because that will only make you more aggravated. Also it sounds to me that he is trying to become popular. He probably doesn't think he is cool, but he wants people to think he's cool. Don't give him the time of day. He's a loser.
Eo8I3fbnaa	Invite them over. Don't wait to be invited. You do the hosting. Let them get to know you better. You are going to be rejected but don't take it too seriously. Some people are not allowed to hang out because of parents and don't want everybody knowing.  Get their phone #'s and call them to develop better friendships.  Ask for help. Tell someone you need help shopping for new clothes but you don't wanna go with your parents. I hope that helps and good luck.
iJeGjRTTaa	Calm!!! This is what the strife of life is like.<br>  <br>  This doesn't sound like a good friend... I think you should just ditch him and forget about him. He shouldn't have the right to sue you or something like that over nothing! Stand up for yourself. His attitude is rotten and he's just not good for you. Be brave and say it right to his face all his wrongs. Leave him to think about what you said; if he doesn't change then shoo him away. He doesn't need a good friend like you! :)|`|lSAPg5Uuaa	dude...you need to just confront him. he is just bullying you. he cant sue you cuz your under 18(i thin) and also cuz you can take a lie detector test. and they have people who can tell if you are lying so dont worry. just tell him that he cant do anything and leave him alone from their. trust me, when this somewhat happened to me...i just told him that he cant do anything and that i never wanted to see him again eventhough we were in the same class
zzaScg0haa	Sit down when you and you parents are calm and have a rational conversation with them about what you want from your relationship with them
AA11909552	I wouldn't worry about it so much. I don't think these 3 boys would be a threat to your relationship with Leonard. In fact, I do not think *anyone* would care about your relationship. Especially, the teachers.<br>  Heck, you two could be the talk of the entire school and you wouldn't even know it. That would be kinda good, too, though. You two would be celebrities like Brad Pitt & Angelina.<br>  I wouldn't worry sssO much. You are making a mountain out of a mole hill.<br>  Good luck.
pa8vbP5taa	I suggest you read this article on penis size...<br>  <a href="http://blog.fucktube.com/penis-size/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.fucktube.com/penis-size/</a>|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Yeah...better get a couple of inches lopped off....|`|FqrKjtzwaa	It's only too big if the girls you stick it in think it's too big. So ask them.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	Wow I was thinking diameter and I got scared!  Those muscle have flexibility, the right woman can handle it.|`|rtTgkO4Naa	its not the size but the way you use it..
uiGx0rPVaa	Choose 2 of them to be your friends and one of them to be your man! I'll eliminate 2nd and 3rd dude from your list.|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	Well you should be with the person you actually like and I'm assuming that's the first guy. But, you should probably make sure you guys are still 'together' because you don't usually "forget" someone's your boyfriend|`|5bt3ujJraa	Damn girl. You a playerr.|`|db4b570a45aa90c27a2f308183e6dc0baa	why don't you dump all of them? or you follow your heart.|`|7ciyIN1Waa	peanut butter|`|LOtStdFraa	wtf this is the stupidest thing ive ever heard.|`|ZajpiDDMaa	slut|`|AA11263103	Slutt.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I'm assuming that none of them knows about any of the others. If they all know about each other that's one thing. But if they don't, that's not good at all. I think everybody would rather be dumped than to be cheated on. I also have a rule that I think everybody in a relationship should live by...  "When interacting with the opposite sex. You should always behave as if your partner is standing right next to you".<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you should you break up with all of them and work on yourself. Sort out what you really want in a relationship first. Date rather than just enter into a relationship, simply because you want a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  You may have strong feelings for Nick, but I don't think you should be with him. The fact that you forgot you're his girlfriend of one year, says a lot about your relationship or rather the lack of one.<br>  <br>  As for Adam. Sounds like you're with him only because he pays attention to you. If he likes you as much as you say he does, then he sounds like a nice guy that deserves more than you can offer him as a girlfriend. Since it's only been a week... Break it off with him before he gives you any more of his heart. No doubt he'll want to know why... Be honest and tell him why. It will hurt. But not as much as if he finds out several months into a relationship with you.<br>  <br>  With Peter. If you barely see him, or communicate with him,  and he ignores you, then you're not really a couple anyway. Breaking up with Peter officially, would most likely just be a formal declaration that you're no longer a couple.
Z5U5uYv0aa	Go on the date and be honest about your concerns. He should understand. If not, you did not miss out on anything. Plus if you don’t go out with him and give it a chance, you may wind up regretting it in the future. There is no worse love than a love not even given a chance. Have fun on your date!!|`|AA10776535	Just go ice skating...Enjoy now and give this guy a chance.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	why not just enjoy yourself?<br>  Even if it is for only a few months?
ise05jjUaa	Telling you her problems as far as what?  Relationship problems?  Are you a dude?  If so & she's telling you her relationship problems she needs to talk to her partner not you, she's never going to get anything resolved by talking to everyone else besides the person she's got issues with.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	If you read palmistry books you will solve your problem,even though palmistry is not 100%scientific<br>  --You know that you can write E  mail messages to me  through this section by clicking the word e mail by opening  my  profile|`|xKsbvwWTaa	just tell her that things will be okay.  that always seems to cheer me up.  and if you can relate to her you should.  if she is really opening up to you then don't be close off, open up yourself a little, it might make her feel better to know she's not the only one with problems and they can be overcome.|`|XIhGx6dvaa	Do you want to have sex with her? <br>  <br>  If so, listen carefully but be kind of a dick about it. Don't talk sh*t, but laugh at her problems unless they're something like "I got molested by my uncle." In that case, just listen.<br>  <br>  If not, you're wasting your time (or gay, which is fine.)|`|BLhS6G9naa	she needs help <br>  help her <br>  let her know u r there for her<br>  if she is ur girlfriend or u want her to be than take at most care of here|`|IrHi1zCkaa	just listen to her that's your safest bet and if you've got some advice on her problems them give it to her that wont hurt

FZKFLTyLaa	Drinking lowers inhibitions, and yes, I've hooked up only to regret it later, but at the moment it was just fine!!
PRjvY6Vgaa	Probably try to bring them out of their shell.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I guess they just show their out-going personality as usual.
7e4jxj3Daa	Not if the two of you have a good relationship going.
MtQ9ea2Uaa	Okay get ready, you're not going to like my cliche answer but:<br>  <br>  TIME! Time will heal it. Try to get your mind off of her by hanging out with friends, your family even, thinking of other girls, just get yourself busy with other things. Keep your mind occupied. I wouldn't rush into another relationship because it'd be to forget her not because you like this new girl. And you'll just compare everything about her and what she does to your ex.<br>  <br>  Trust me. I have been there and most of us have suffered a heartbreak. I hated people that would tell me time would heal the "wounds" but it did. It definitely did.|`|duISQSSWaa	Get a new one if you can,t than keep yourself busy with some work your job or something, let me know if it doesn,t work.|`|mjpXqNNfaa	I feel like I'm in the same boat as you sometimes. I try to occupy myself with things I like to do instead of focusing on the other person.<br>  <br>  Meeting new people is a good way to forget about someone as well.  If you don't like to socialize with new people, you can try working out at the gym/home and keeping yourself healthy and busy. Exercise makes you feel good and releases a lot of feel good, happy drugs in your body.  If you like reading, buy a light book or one from your favorite author that you will enjoy. Keep yourself busy and hang out with your friends and don't talk about her. Keep it private and to yourself because your friends will not want to hear it rehashed over and over.<br>  <br>  Pull all those memories of your guys away in a box, everything - the pictures, tapes, recordings, mementos, all her stuff. Just stick them in a box and move them to the back of your closet or basement. When and if you want to throw them away, you can. And if things work out again, you will have it all there. The idea is to help keep yourself in the present instead of living in the memories of past inside your head.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds cliche but work on yourself and good things will happen to you. Instead of loving someone else, show yourself love. Love yourself more. So go do what you like and do it for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care.|`|6a91180b44e0a6b431960aadc7ad7362aa	Honestly it takes time that is the only cure and whiel you are waiting just do somethign for yourself that makes you happy and focus with  it. i remember when i was single i hung out with my friends i kept avoiding when i was dating this guy i wasnt over with and it took me some time but i got over him. and the funny thing now is now that i look back i wonder why i wasnt over him inthe frist place cause of all the bad things. there is a reason for everything keep your head up|`|C3cH7RALaa	it was Love in net???????????????<br>  and very easy approach to her anytime?????????????<br>  so find new one like her...........lot of in net u ll get better than best <br>  it is real.............??????????????n she went with other guy?<br>  then wait till break up n try ur best to get back.<br>  if she went married ??????????????then love her till last breath but don't say this love to any1.........and start ur new life with new gal.<br>  if u can't do anything above..................<br>  just type ur problem in yahoo or talk with others like a loser...........<br>  oooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br>  wake up get up n do ur best for ur future...........with her sweet memories. make them ur power n i m sure u cna fight with any problem

0fcd3800ab38461be598c51011f7d438aa	If you really want children and he doesn't somewhere down the line you are going to resent him for that.  I suggest that if you guys can not come to an agreement on Children then you need to stop and think real hard on what you truly want.  Would you be happy if you never had children ???  If not, then I think you know the answer.|`|n3Agaj6naa	No I don't think you are over-reacting.  For some people kids are a deal breaker.  Personally, if my fiance insisted on having kids, that would be the end of the relationship for me.<br>  <br>  There are some things you just can't compromise.  Obviously for you, having children is one of them.  You shouldn't sacrifice your life experience, if it really is that important to you.|`|vJwl2uoBaa	I would not call it off so fast.  People change their minds about things and he may just be overwhelmed about the huge commitment he is getting ready to make and may be scared of committing to anything else right this second.  I would just casually ask him if you can leave that conversation open for later discussion.  If he says yes, great.  If not, maybe you need to make him aware of how important it is to you.  Remember that you will never be able to quit working on your marriage.  For better or worse.  Make it happen.  If divorce is an option, you will get a divorce.  I wish you a lot of happiness.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	I agree with the second answer. If he's never stated as much before, then it sounds to me like it's just the stress of everything hitting him all at once.<br>  <br>  Also, I think that a lot of times, men get worried that if a woman has already voiced that she wants kids before the marriage, that she will want to start trying for one as soon as they've said their vows.<br>  <br>  Definitely talk to him about it and find out if he thinks that he'll ever change his mind on the subject, because if so.. what's the rush to have children now? Enjoy being married a bit!|`|lPJSF3vRaa	You say you are totally in love so how could even think of leaving,  He may change his mind in years to come but are you willing to take that chance,if children mean that much to you go now,  Think of what you have and what you might have who;s  to say you can have  children anyway.  I wish you well
L1EnPN67aa	I don't go to bars or clubs really, so I would say just in regular places. Like a library, church, the grocery store. Real women who are doing normal things, who are busy living their lives and not really out looking for a man. You want a woman who has self esteem and has a life of her own. <br>  <br>  I can't stereotype all types of women, but if you like the types that are always at bars and clubs then go for it. You know what you like, so go and hang around some places where the type of women you like are at...|`|CUKkN3ZRaa	now a days...online<br>  <br>  try a dating website.. it works for a lot of people<br>  bars.. well you never get to know that person, its so loud in there, its a waste of time<br>  your friends- they may know of some single girls to fix you up with, ask them<br>  <br>  but yeah try a dating site 1st|`|Njgof6hNaa	Bookstores, bars, coffee shops, grocery store, cooking classes. Another thing to remember, is that it helps to hang out at places that follow your interests. You'll bump into people who share your interests and you might want to date.|`|F6SilA1Faa	some ppl say <br>  bars, clubs, gyms, church, parties, college<br>  <br>  i say the best place is a dating site<br>  <br>  there are a million out there!<br>  and there's no messing around its pretty str8 forward. <br>  <br>  its what im doing n its wrking out great|`|H5Sk2ftqaa	at the park<br>  beach, hiking trail,<br>  depends on what type<br>  of guy / girl you're looking for|`|hLSIRDtZaa	On a street corner or wherever you see a woman walking the streets at night looking for someone to pick them up.

He sounds off to me. Find another guy who is not like that. :)|`|Biz65DQpaa	i think you should ask him straight out about it. It's no use speculating and if you do know the guy, then what's the problem. <br>  If you trust him, then if he says no, then ask him out but if he says yes, then it could get ugly for you. It is really dangerous to go out with a guy who is on drugs since under the effect of drugs, anything can happen.<br>  And as for fighting, well, which guy does not do that? as long as he doesn't get you involved, it's fine, I think.|`|Zgu62uoQaa	actions speak louder than words.  he might sound nice on the phone, but if he's a jerk to other people and if he's telling the truth about the drugs and fights, those actions scream that he is not nice...now you are dealing with a jerk AND someone deceiving you by pretending to be something they aren't<br>  <br>  run away...date someone nice in his actions and words|`|C3cH7RALaa	hey beware n stop ur relatons with him becaz Drugs r Certificate of Death...<br>  if u wana him then it is impossible u can't ridoff him from his drugs<br>  they ll be on priority b4 u.<br>  or the crazy n bad way mad way is u join his company n start using drugs...................n get from him what u like in him................<br>  if u have own mind u decide what u want otherwise lsiten n consult ur family n friends.|`|SBTbYr7baa	If this guy does drugs I would stay away or try to find him help because if you don't he will try to pressure you into things you don't want to do. that's what guys do.|`|AA11377195	Stay away from him
XfSJZCEyaa	Forget it. It seems he does like you, but there's a small possibility its a 'no'. Either way this guy seems like he'll bring on too much drama even if you two end up together. He seems likely to be overly emo when you two get together or he becomes overly jealous or clingy. <br>  <br>  Its best to move on.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	ok it sounds like he likes you but got embarrassed because people don't mind their own business it sounds like your in middle school you might not be but people need to grow up if your not. look he is just embarrassed he likes you and maybe his friends give him a hard time so he says things to try and look good and then they repeat them. he doesn't mean to be a dick sit him down some where and confront him.|`|e0urnErUaa	wow <br>  his got hella issues <br>  <br>  is he playing hard to get??|`|B6bNfTDWaa	He is trying to act all good.

Pull him somewhere private and chat with him see what is going on.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	yeah, ask him on the comp. cuz if he really does like you but is embarresed around ppl or something he wouldnt say it in front of you..<br>  <br>  :)|`|d36OrpbDaa	dude.<br>  <br>  take a deep breath, and step back.<br>  <br>  it doesn't matter whether or not he likes you.  he's ridiculously immature.  he's always going through other people, and some of them have been rude to you (i'm sorry they hurt your feelings!).<br>  <br>  don't even bother with him.  if he can't be straight up and actually talk to you, what chance do you have with him even if he DOES like you?<br>  <br>  it's not about you... it's about him being immature and having lame friends.  whatever they say that's rude only makes them look bad.  it says nothing bad about you.  whoever said you're ugly was an idiot and obviously has no manners or respect for anyone.  and your crush chooses him as a friend??<br>  <br>  there are too many other people out there who don't play ridiculously stupid mind games to even BOTHER with this guy!|`|skDPEcc8aa	DROP HIM LIKE A BAD HABIT IF HE CAN'T TALK TO YOU THEN HE IS EITHER SCARED OF GIRLS ARE GAY WHAT I WOULD DO IS ASK HIM WHAT HIS PROBLEM IS IN FRONT OF ALL HIS LITTLE FRIENDS AND AFTER HE GAVE YOU AN ANWSER I WOULD BEAT HIS BUTT AND WALK AWAY AND GO FIND SOMEONE THAT IS GOING TI TREAT YOU THE WAY YOU WOULD TREAT THEM|`|OzWvcOQnaa	Confront him<br>  personally<br>  yeah its hard<br>  but you have to, if you want to sleep <br>  seriously just tell him wtf is up with him?|`|SmOefD5Raa	is this a special ed school?|`|C3cH7RALaa	prepare urself n be brave n ready to accept all things what r going around u n ur guy becaz as the people grow up every year their needs their things their priorities changed.<br>  so be calm n gentle n ask simply n accept what he says................if negative things go away from him<br>  god bless u<br>  don't stuck on one thing try to look all around u ll found pretty things|`|CGhwiVwdaa	I'm guessing your young, so let me give you the best advice I can give you... First off, he might be shy to tell you and some guys when confronted or put in a tight spot and they think you might say you dont like them could turn around and be mean just so they dont get hurt/embarassed. If I was in your spot, I would straight up ask the person what the deal is. If you are to scared do it over msn, otherwise its honestly best to do it in person, just make sure its done privately and at a place were if your feelings are hurt you wont make a scene, as in school is not a good place to ask him.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Umm wow this guy sounds like a real piece of work.  Hes obviously too immature to think about dating.  I would start ignoring him.  Give him a few years to grow up and maybe he'll stop acting like such a weirdo.|`|rvUbfd1Jaa	Ok. Here's what i think. This guy is a little immature. I mean come on! Hiding behind a tree? Getting other people to say to you that he likes you? Being nice and suddenly turning nasty?  Frankly he sounds like a push over. Or maybe he is just really shy. But if you really do like this boy get him on his own and confidently and clearly ask him if he likes you or not. Then decide if you still like him.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )
AA11274034	Ya know,... He is just SHY to MEET YOU!!!!  That is why he does this to you... Just keep after him, let him know YOU are Interested in Him!!!! YOU will get Him Eventually!!!!       GOOD LUCK GIRL !!|`|uAzToWC7aa	he dosent hang out with you anymore to avoid rumors about u 2 going out. he hangs out with other girls to prove that he dosent like you that way and to make new lady friend for the time being. he looks at u to make sure ur not hurt too bad. its not cuz hes making u jealous. wait fjor about a month and then try talking to him. no less than 1 month! GL|`|d36OrpbDaa	he sounds immature.  maybe he's just weirded out that you like him.  but it's not weird to have a crush on someone... i think he's just too immature to know how to handle it.<br>  <br>  don't ask him why he acts like that.  he'll just see it as you coming on to him.  if he says don't talk to him, that's rude, and immature, and obviously he's not going to talk with you to explain his behavior.<br>  <br>  better to find out the kind of guy he is now, than later on!|`|Biz65DQpaa	A guy who stops talking to you just because he found out you have a crush on him is not worthy to even be your friend. <br>  Also, the way he talks to oher girls and then looks at you might be a way to find out how much you like him or it might be a way to make you suffer.<br>  Try talking to him and to sort it all out. If he does not listen then you should move on.|`|SBTbYr7baa	sounds like a jerk find some one else

Anything can happen, maybe it's just not the right time. Be patient and it'll work out. As for his girl, she's obviously jelous and is trying to stop you from talking to him. Hope it works out for you.|`|jjpwYLeuaa	You be his good friend for a little more time and  the time will tell if he is interested in you .Don't at all be afraid of  the jealous girlfriend or supervisor .If you like the guy then try hanging out more and more.|`|oE3pkpCAaa	uhm i guess hes just testing the waters first. if hes really into you,he would end his relationship and pursue u..of course the gf would be jealous if hes giving u ol those attention.but remember we dont know what he told her. maybe he told her u r flirting with him thats y shes giving u dirty looks..its safe to keep ur distance:)|`|121bf7421c6e2471d7a187d525e9abb1aa	I think it's pretty obvious that he's into you. As for his girlfriend, she's scared that she's gonna lose him to you. So try your hardest to make that happen.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Well he likes you, but you need to think twice.  If he dates you and drop you what will you do.  I advise you before careful with him.  You need some one that will really love you and keep to it.|`|040b69609e6a031b503a985b8d63b350aa	he likes you. BUT, you need to be careful because if he's with his girlfriend now and he's flirting with you that shows you that he has the potential to do it to you too if he dates you.

wOBZEFXFaa	On a wedding website you can dedicate a whole page to accomodations for guests. The website is usually very useful for guests because they can RSVP, request songs (for the reception), see where you are registered, and even watch a slideshow of you and your honey!<br>  <br>  Basic sites are free and you get to personalize the URL. My favorite site (with the most fancy tools and options) is www.weddingwire.com but you go to www.brides.com or www.theknot.com. Also, getting the word out about the website is easy, just include an insert in the invitation OR if it is too late for that, there is nothing wrong with emailing friends the URL.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Either include the info in your save-the-date or have an insert in the wedding invitation itself providing them the details (price, number to call to arrange, location, etc).|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	You should definitely go with the alternate hotel venue for the reception- it matters very llittle how posh a place is if the guests are going to get better service for a discount.  In these troubled times, we all need to save money wherever we can.<br>  <br>  In the invitations for the out-of-town guests, slip a little printed note in which reads: "A block of rooms has been reserved at *hotel* for our guests' convenience.  Please mention that you are with the *Bride and Groom Names* party upon reservation to receive special rates."  And then put the hotel's address and phone number on there too so they can make reservations there.|`|47d1n4svaa	Well I provided my guests with information about hotels in the area in case they wanted to stay in the area after the wedding since it is going to end at one am. What I did was make a wedding website that I sent to all my family and friends about all the information about the wedding and a section on where they can stay in the area if they do not want to drive home that night. You can also add the wedding website info to your map that you can include with your invitation so they have access to all that information. $38 dollars per person I think is a great price. I am having 140 guests at my wedding and we are paying $140.00 per person, I’m getting married at a Golf and country club. The hotels in Toronto were quoting me $200 dollars per person so you did rather well!<br>  Good luck with the wedding|`|sGP6s7uraa	On the back of the map to the venue,  we've included a section for the venue's website as well as:<br>  <br>  Name of Place has reserved two roomed condominiums for our guests for a discounted price of $150 (plus tax) per night with a two night minimum stay.  If you are interested in these accomodations, please contact Name of Place and speak with Name.  We advise "rooming" with a well acquainted couple or guest so that the expense to you is only $75 per night.  <br>  <br>  This is only an example that I hope you can use.  The second choice sounds the best.  If you don't love it, don't go with it.  Instincts will let you know :)|`|cGbTJobeaa	We had a semi-destination wedding...it was at a resort town about 90 minutes from where most of our guests live.  Our wedding took up about half of the hotel.<br>  <br>  What we did was we reserved a block of rooms at a group rate.  The hotel required the reservations be made 2 months before the wedding.  Ugh! Considering that we weren't going to send out the invitations until 6 weeks before the wedding we had to send out the hotel info ahead of time in order to give our friends and family some time to make their reservations.<br>  <br>  What we did was about 2 1/2 months before the wedding, we sent out a postcard to everyone on our guest list.  It said something like "A Lake Geneva weekend and a wedding."<br>  <br>  We said that there was a group rate available at XYZ hotel and that the hotel had this set of ammenities (pool, free breakfast, free shuttle bus to and from reception, internet accessible).  The post card also included info on a golf outing with the groom the morning of the wedding.<br>  <br>  It was up to everyone to call and reserve...or not.  And they did in droves. Even who lived close by stayed at the hotel. It was weird.<br>  <br>  I created business cards that had this same information and included that with the invitations.  <br>  <br>  Because people spent $90 a night to stay at the hotel to attend the wedding, I prepared a gift bag for each room.  It had stuff in there like chips, bottled water and candy. We also included a tourist magazine for the town (coupons) and a thank you packet from us. The thank you packet was a letter thanking them for their love, support and friendship over the years. It also gave them directions to and from the hotel to the various venues and gave a schedule of events.  (Total cost less than $5 per bag and I assembled them while watching TV about a month before the wedding.)<br>  <br>  Included in the schedule of events was breakfast with the bride and groom.  Since the hotel had free breakfast, we made sure we were in the breakfast area from 7 - 9.  I figure if our friends and family made the effort to spend a weekend on me, I could go the extra mile to show my appreciation back.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!
JF0SIngqaa	You should look for more friends. One is busy and the other one doesn't want to stay in contact. Try to get out and meet new people. You can never have to many friends.|`|183e99810d00196cd16aa11a9f77c72daa	People your age are busy with lives,college,kids, and work. You could talk to them about it. Maybe they just got tired of always calling you and you never call them. Sometimes people get annoyed or just move on but trust me theres a lot more people to be friends with !!
ABMvstsaaa	Dont change just do things differently, there's time and place for everything but when it starts to interfere with your school work, you know something needs to change. Its up to you to do it, no one can make you do something. Coming from experience very similar to yours, dont get into a state where you dont reach your full potential as you mentioned you were smart. Why not get enrolled into something where your personality would be appreciated? You should also be proud of yourself for admitting that something needs to change even if its not your personality. Why not see someone at your school or something that offers constructive advice about this? Just remember though, there are some people who would love to have a personality like yours and in the future when it comes to adapting to new surroundings and stuff it will be an advantage of yours.|`|fVVtJQQsaa	omg u sound JUST like me but i dont really get made fun of because everyone in my class is like that, and im also in 8th grade, but dont worry because were still young :P

Other times we are able to detect an alteration to our values and are able to communicate that to our partner. But sometimes we aren't. There is almost an algebraic formula for this. Our values are a big component of who we are.

KwNpyp3saa	Don 't let him manipulate you. He is married and the fact that he told you he was cheated on is one way for him to gain your trust and sympathy. He has no business calling you sexy. The only reason he got offended is because you called him out on his stuff. It is better you steer clear of him.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Heck no you weren't wrong.  You were right.

If you do, then just go for it - no point in making it long and dramatic.  If you don't, then don't.  But if your talks about his shroom use consist of you telling him not to do it, don't expect him to actually stop.

Unless you know he can quit for good, you may just give him a chance. But if he's choosing the drugs over you, then it's just going to be an endless cycle.

63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I have 2 teenage children (13 and 16) and have been married for almost 22 years.  I have been home with my kids for their entire lives.  I have always done what you are doing - I work around the kids schedules.<br>  <br>  I will tell you - this is by far the BEST thing you will ever do in your entire life.  Being the one to raise your children will do more for them than anything.  It will also make for a wonderful relationship between you and them.  Even when times are hard while raising them, it is worth it!  <br>  <br>  I know many will disagree, but why in the world would people think that someone making minimum wage (or any salary for that matter) would be a better choice to raise their children.  A paid employee is NEVER as invested in your children as you are - ever.  They will never care as much as a loving mother and father.  And, the kids will feel unwanted.<br>  <br>  Even though my kids are teenagers, we have a great relationship.  My family is very close and we enjoy time together.  We are not perfect, but we all love and care deeply for each other.  I feel it is in large part because I have stayed home and I am the one that sets the tone of the family and keeps us connected.  It is so very worth it!<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing.  Your friends know deep down they are not and they rationalize what they are doing and put you down.

Perhaps the next time one of them calls to schedule lunch ask, "And will all of you lovely ladies be stepping down off your soap-boxes today, or shall I be eating lunch somewhere else?"

It sucks, it really does but they gotta learn somehow. =D|`|7iBWvRBgaa	If you are talking about children around..let's say  10 years old (or younger), in my opinion,it's best to teach them what you know from your own experience and you can also encourage them to learn by themselves because that way they can learn even better and we know that sometimes children won't listen to parents,but if they encounter a difficult situation and realize that what they said was right, the little ones will hopefully pay more attention to their parents.<br>  Briefly, it's correct allowing children to learn from our experience,but also the second choice is needed.|`|GHHiHlX2aa	before answering your question , i would like to ask you a question ;<br>  " DID YOU EVER LISTENED TO YOUR PARENTS WHEN YOU WAS YOUNG OR LEARNED FROM THERE EXPERIENCES ?"<br>  <br>  dear , in this life everybody lives & works and earn his/her own experiences , which he can share with other people including there young ones , but until unless you yourself taste the experience , You won't get the flavour of it .<br>  <br>  elders should guide young ones , young ones should listen to them , but should experience the things by there own , which would make them suitably fit for world out there .|`|5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	in some cases they need to learn from their experiance. most of the time young children need to learn from there own.  you may not be talking about this young but it may applie anyway my son tried to touch a hot candle i told him not to it will burn you well he did it anyway now he will never touch a candle again he learned he did not belive me so he had to learn on his own. Sometimes with teenagers or young children you have to show them why you say what you say what the consequences will be if they do what they want to do and you know it is a very bad thing for them to do. i wanted to teach my older child gun safety so i showed him what a gun can do and what it can do if he ever pointed to anyone. I did a target and i said see and that is why you do not play with guns and you do the rules that i set for you because guns are not a toy they are very dangerous if not used properly and you always always need adult supervision before you even thing about using or touching a gun. Know he knows why i say what i say about guns. <br>   IT also depends on the situation and how old they are if they are teenagers i would want them to learn from my past mistakes not there but that is not always going to happen. If you show them what it did to you  maybe it will direct them in the right direction. <br>  hope this helps|`|k51emtyUaa	Young children would not make head or tail of your experience so, unless it is too harsh and trying they should be left to gain experience on their own.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Some things are instilled in them over the course of their childhood.<br>  But not much can truly be learned from others experiences or wisdom.<br>  We must experience and learn for ourselves.

And in this process of encouraging the child's Independence while in adolescence, of course guided under the supervision of caring parents, in whom should have no desire or wish to impose their own experiential knowledge onto their little ones. We have all been conditioned to be over protective and excessively concerned for the well-being of our young. And consequently, the child grows an unhealthy dependence upon the parents guidance system, rather than making Independent choices to create that what they wish to experience.<br>  <br>  The child like adults are energy imbued beings, who are brought into this world to create and contribute to the expansion of consciousness, and to manifest physical representations of consciousness so that they may manufacture greater, grander conceptions about who they are, and where they want to be, and to appropriately shape their independant thinking to attract whatever it is that they desire. <br>  <br>  Naturally as parents we should always endeavour to instill in the child a sense of unlimited freedom relating to their potential to create and become anything that they want. And our role is to facilitate, as overseers, to ensure their physical safety, so that they may live to experience the fullness and diversity of their lives. A child has the natural proclivity to learn and evolve into higher states of thinking; without the need of being forced into thinking a certain way. We should only intervene and guide our children when it is evident that they are causing harm to themselves, either emotionally or physically, and then lead them to understanding the process of, what it is, they are trying to achieve, so that they are aware of the fundamental physical laws and the boundries of mortal danger. Many parents have been programed by their parents, and so on, to encourage there children to replicate there methods for living life. But this can reduce the childs power to think for themselves within any situation, limiting their perspective to what they have been taught and have leaned from others, rather than learning entirely from their personal direct experience. <br>  <br>  I hope this is clear and not confusing.

We should give all reason and understand when we instruct so that the child can see why something should be done or should not be done.<br>  If we do not regulate and teach a child proper control, then it will grow up out of control and irregular in all it's habits.<br>  If the parents have bad habits, or act in uncontrolled ways around the children, you can expect the children to grow up even worse.<br>  If father smokes, child will want too also, as he will think that it is an adult thing to do.

You can use any ring you want for your wedding band, including your engagement ring! <br>  <br>  Just one logistical factor you may want to consider: some women dont wear their engagement ring every day because its more fragile (expensive) than their wedding band. Engagement rings often have one large diamond protruding from the ring, while wedding bands are often plain or gems are set flush to the band. However if this is a ring you are comfortable wearing every day, go for it!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I think if you love your e-ring than still use it.

That way it's cheaper, but it will still look good.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	I use the same ring but not by choice, my band doesn't fit right no matter what I do so I wear it around my neck.

My engagement ring is a scalloped-band style, so it I would have had to have a wedding band custom-made to fit with it.  I just didn't see the point in that.  Also, my e-ring is a family heirloom, so the meaning is in this ring more than it would be in a new wedding band.  I don't know if people are confused about whether I'm married or still engaged, but it doesn't matter to me.  <br>  <br>  My sister-in-law also uses her (family heirloom) engagement ring as her wedding ring.  Like you, she just didn't want to wear two rings and more bling.  So, it's not as unusual as you might think to wear just one ring.

Do onething ask her to say the truth and ask her directly if she likes you only if  you like her..<br>  Just by having a doubt within you on a gal is not the rightway..<br>  Even if you like her then go and ask her directly that if she likes you...|`|fV2SYj60aa	She likes you.

cMAlbDaSaa	yes but most people don't have the back bone to admit<br>  <br>  once you get in the 3rd or 4th year you realize that its not as easy and cost way more than you ever thought and sometimes you wish you could back out now! but you don't cuz that little kids depends on you!<br>  <br>  i have twins and i take care of them with out a mom, so its just me and i can see that but i would never turn my back on them now!<br>  <br>  but my life would be much easier now if i did nt have kids, that's just the truth!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I call it "teen pregnancy" or "deadbeat father" cases.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I wish I'd had one instead of three. I'm not cut out for all the commotion, plus my middle one is profoundly disabled. Then my third one, whom I had no intention of having, was a product of birth control failure. She's delightful and I totally love her, but it's all just too much. Plus they're spread over 15 years. I was tired by the time I got the first one out of the house, and I was no where near done. Please don't judge me. No one has the vaguest idea what it's like to raise a violent, explosive child. He dad was always gone, so it was just me. No one  (grandparents, etc.) want to help with a child like her. It was excruciatingly difficult.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Of course there are - look how many people leave a relationship within the first 3 years of a child's life. It's not just men. I used to babysit for a father whose wife left him with a 3 year old and 9 month old because she said she made a mistake having children and was not cut out for motherhood. The boys are now both in high school and still have had no further contact with their mother.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	I think that people who had them hoping it would save their relationship or fix their relationship sometimes regret it.  Especially when they discover that having a child or another child was not the answer.   I think people like that are reckless and irresponsible.|`|498JdszFaa	You make perfect sense lilWunz. I am so very happy with my girl, and I wanted a baby badly. My ex didn't, but somehow I convinced him. He just wasn't the right person for it. It ruined our relationship, even though he loves her very much now.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Yes, I do think that there are people who regret having had children, for whatever reason. Fortunately I am not one. <br>  Happy mother of 4.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	The way I understand it is some people have "moments" of regret. They dont want to go back to being childless but they have days of extreme frustration and feel like a slave to everyone.<br>  <br>  It's a short term frustration that gets better as the kids get older. It's normally temporary. People say things that tell you this (not in so many direct terms) but they wouldn't go back for the world.<br>  <br>  There are a few people who are on the verge of adopting out their children for several reasons mainly to give their children a better life...some people aren't meant to have children, they are severly impatient, angry most of the time, have addiction issues or are financially not in a position to care for a child...these people wish they may have had their children at a different time or not at all|`|fLU63N4kaa	I agree with Lenny K, a lot of the time people use it as an excuse for not doing anything with their lives. In my opinion, babies have become almost a "must have item", especially among very young girls. So many women rush into having babies for totally the wrong reasons. But, I'm not here to judge, everyone makes their own decisions and has to live with it and hopefully, be proud of the decision .|`|wUXDKIbuaa	I think it's human nature.  When something gets tough we tend to want out.  But as a parent you decided to have a child so you've got to stick it out and do the best that you can for them.  I love all 3 of mine but I'm in the teenage years with 2 of them and it's a ton of fun. NOT! But how we raise them is how they'll turn out when they become adults. Maybe if everyone does a good job our society will improve a little.|`|ixRkfLjIaa	Very true, but some people will never admit it, they like to play the victim.  Having kids is a perfect excuse to not have done anything with your life.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	Yes I think there are some people who regret having kids for their soulfulness.And just because you give birth makes you  a mother.|`|d36OrpbDaa	yeah, i think some people do.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Oh, I'm quite sure that this happens, and it doesn't make them bad people either...unless they tell the child that.|`|CYmgD1siaa	its probably not the baby they regret. sometimes having the baby with the person you just no longer love anymore is the regret. sometimes people cant leave out the relationship or its harder to leave when the baby is the connection. i dont think i made any sense but thats how i feel.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	yeah. the Octomom.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Well yes.

pOCabUMvaa	You’re in love, and you want to get married or register a civil partnership in Britain. Here’s what you need to know about getting married in Britain:<br>  <br>  Age restrictions<br>  You can marry or register a civil partnership in England, Wales and Northern Ireland if you’re: <br>  <br>  ? Both over 18 and free to marry (single, widowed or divorced). <br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  ? 16 or 17 with parental consent. <br>  <br>  In Scotland, you can marry or register a civil partnership without parental consent if you’re both over 16.<br>  <br>   <br>  Giving notice<br>  If you want to get married or register a civil partnership in Britain, you first have to give notice of your intent to marry or register a civil partnership. <br>  <br>  If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll need to provide evidence that you’re now free to marry. This might be a divorce decree absolute, final order of civil partnership dissolution bearing the court's original stamp or a death certificate for your former partner.<br>  <br>  England and Wales <br>  In England and Wales, you have to reside in the district you are giving notice in for 7 days before giving notice. After this, both partners can give notice in person to the Superintendent Registrar (Registrar General in Scotland) at the local register office in England and Wales (www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/marriages/), Scotland (www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registra... or Northern Ireland (www.groni.gov.uk/contacts.asp). <br>  <br>  When giving notice, you’ll need to give evidence of your name, age and nationality (passport). You’ll also need to give evidence that you’ve resided in the district for 7 days. This can be a letter from friends or family you might be staying with, or a letter or bill from the hotel you are staying at. <br>  <br>  If you plan to have a civil ceremony in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, you can give notice in one district, but marry or register your civil partnership in another.<br>  <br>  Immigration control<br>  If you’re subject to immigration control, you won’t be able to give notice unless you have a fiancée visa or a marriage visa. For more information, visit the British High Commission (www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=O... If you want to register a civil partnership, you must give notice at a designated office (www.gro.gov.uk/Images/dro_tcm69-14324.p... When giving notice, you and your partner must go together. <br>  <br>  Scotland<br>  In Scotland, notices should be handed in 4 weeks before the marriage or civil partnership, and you need to register in the district where the marriage is to take place. The latest you can hand in notices is 15 days before the ceremony. You don’t both need to attend the register office to give notice, but you may be asked to attend before the marriage or civil partnership to finalise details. <br>  <br>  If you’re from a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), you won’t need to provide any Home Office documents, but the registrar may ask to see proof of your nationality. If you’re not from a country in the EEA, you’ll need a fiancée, marriage, or marriage tourist visa, which you can obtain from the British Embassy (www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=O...<br>  <br>  Northern Ireland<br>  In Northern Ireland, notices should be handed in 8 weeks before the marriage or civil partnership. The latest you can hand in notices is 2 weeks before the ceremony. You don’t both need to attend the register office to give notice, but you may be asked to attend before the marriage or civil partnership to finalise details. <br>  <br>  If you’re from a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), you won’t need to provide any Home Office documents, but the registrar may ask to see proof of your nationality.

During that time, a notice is put up in the registry office of your intent to marry or register for a civil partnership. Once your notice is issued, it’s valid for a year (3 months in Scotland and Northern Ireland) and you can have your wedding or register your civil partnership any time within that period.

Makes sense really doesn't it?|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	It depends how you classify porn and what the make-up of the population is. More men look at pictures of attractive near naked women than they do lurid porn and even then I would say that most look at that and porn only occasionally, the exceptions being weirdo's . However, in the age groups where there are lots of single or divorced men I am sure the results are much higher. The same would apply in areas where there are more men than women in the population. Basically its about release of sexual tension. Don't forget it's not just men that look at porn|`|eJwAZEyZaa	every day|`|dMeVhu0iaa	Porn is boring and it always has the same ending. lol|`|StqBr5XRaa	its a once in awhile thing|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Men watch more porn that women because that is the way the sexual urge works for men and for women it is basically different.

mnasIFdZaa	not all women are like this. Although some are attracted to the 'thug' type. sometimes too nice is boring. <br>  TATA :)|`|GW2i2qqUaa	I am watching Japan losing to Korea. North Korea? I doubt it. So, women like men they can feel secure with some usually at all costs. As well I think Family values has taken a brutal beating and is on its last leg in this country because women feel that being a mother and a career woman is the natural course of things. Not a lot of people woud agree with me. I mean I think it is great to see female athletes and are them play music. You know staying healthy but the family needs them. This is the problem of becoming so self absorbed in our society. I am not a mysoginist. I would be willing to go further that pedophilia is on the rise because of the consequences women have made with family values|`|IIftmR4waa	people can take things for granted, regardless of being a man or a woman.<br>  but yea the confusion does happen, since women are very emotional, they might would want to go to the guy they loved, nd wouldn't want to break heart of the guy who loves em and pamper them.<br>  <br>  nd yea....being very nice could be boring...|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i do believe that all woman wants to be treated like a Queen and not for a second i believe they want to be mistreated at all. if the mistreat happens, it's only because she was unfortunate to end up with someone like that and sometimes it's too late for her to leave him (maybe).
fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	Yeah, Rufus, that's still lying to Mom and Dad.  A 58 is not passing and a 60 is.  Is there any way you can put the information with your other grades---say in one sentence  "...but my OVERALL grade is still passing" or "but I did some extra credit and that brought my grade up...."<br>  <br>  Don't break your parents' trust by lying to them about something like this.  Just figure out what you're going to do about it so the exam grade won't be the only thing you have to tell them.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Not really, like you said, you are just rounding it off...LOL...|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes it is lying. What is the difference between 58 and 60? You flunked it either way. You do not want to get caught lying. It is easier to tell the truth than to get caught and eventually you will.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	No, you're just giving them an estimate- granted, 60 isn't much better, so why not just tell the truth, but like you said, you're just rounding it off and it's not that bad.|`|lMR4PpATaa	It depends on whether or not 58% is failing, as opposed to 60% passing.  If this is the case, then you are lying about failing.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	well it IS lying but its not bad, its just a white lie.|`|AA11857809	yes....100% lying.....how do you round off a lie ?|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	I have to ask you WHY you feel the need to tell your parents that you got a 60 and not just tell them the truth? I suspect that it is because you KNOW that a 58 is worse than a 60 correct? If this is the case then YES it is a lie. When you lie to someone you are not only disrespecting them you are disrespecting yourself. Every time you lie SOMEONE WILL find out. Do you REALLY think that you parents are not going to look at your report card? Ask your self this, Is this worth loosing the trust and respect of my parents? If you answer that as a yes, then you are in need of a little education. <br>  <br>  Have a nice day.|`|823Z8NH3aa	well... technically it's lying, you might say something like "60ish" or "pretty much 60". But believe me, even if it's little, you'll regret ever lying to your parents. Especially when they're gone.|`|QQzX1NIFaa	LOL. Yeah it's still lying, and the difference between the two numbers isn't worth the price that you inevitably pay for any lie.|`|fJ0csRIIaa	Is a 58 an f and a 60 a c? and really 58 and 60 are not the same number, If you have to ask, it's lying.|`|9EV86TLvaa	Just say 58% and tell the truth. I would be happy with 58% its over half. Go out with your head held high. Good luck.|`|wBKMELBPaa	It is wrong...<br>  <br>  You should tell them the truth... good luck|`|9298mlxoaa	i call it fibbing. like u said, ur rounding. lol|`|URhkDQ8Kaa	Yes, if it is different than the truth, then it is a lie! <br>  <br>  I think rounding off grades is ok, if your teacher does it.  But a grade is a grade.  And if you tell them a different grade, then they could find out the truth later.  Just try to bring them up.  Good Luck!|`|Sa1vMf9taa	it's just 2% wtf<br>  <br>  ...my mom even if i was telling the truth she wouldnt believe meeeeeeeee|`|08afeNEEaa	yes dude it isss... lmaol!!
Uj5kuzoJaa	Yes I think it's a great idea. I admire you for that decision. Most women wouldn't be able to do what you're doing. When you talk to him, let him know that you're not trying to take his kid away from him, and that you agree to let him see her when he wants to (if you are comfortable with that). I would rethink telling him in the parking lot of his work. It's never good to bring personal matters to the work place (even if he does work for his dad). Maybe try telling him when he comes home. I still think that Friday is a good day so that gives him the weekend to start packing. This is a very responsible decision and I give you props!|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Have someone like your father or a male friend or somebody to stay with you this weekend because break ups can be difficult and since you are pregnant things might not happen the way you are expecting it to.|`|A4LcPy9haa	Sounds good<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	I agree with your plan; you have to do what's best for you.

I hope that it a all works out for you in the future!<br>  <br>  answer mine plz  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227125132AA4kTL3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AA11071040	Sounds like a good plan, but be prepared for a lot of argument.  You have been his sugar-mama for a while and he probably won't want to give you up that easy.  Also, since you are pregnant with his child, he will be a part of your life forever, so you may want him to think it is his idea to split up.  You may not want to talk to him in the parking lot of his job.  One should never bring personal matters to a place of business, even if his dad is the owner and he is part time.|`|JCdBSULraa	I don't think what you're doing is right, no.  I think it's a crime for a child to be raised without a father.   However, I do see your side of the argument, and it's unfair to you to be expected to take care of essentially two children.   If having him be a responsible parent was a choice, would you take it over the alternative of leaving him?  Also, if he put some investments into this house as well, you're essentially leaving him and robbing him at the same time.  <br>  <br>  Here's what I think you should do.<br>  <br>  When he wakes up in the morning, take his stash so he can't get high, explain that you need to talk to him when he gets home, and he can have it back after he's come down from his high.<br>  <br>  When he gets home, explain to him that the burden of keeping a home, working, and raising a baby is enough of a challenge without having to take care of him like he's an adolescent.   Calmly explain that you don't want to break up, that you don't want to leave him, but if he wants to be the man in your life, that he has to in fact, be a man.  Then set a hard deadline for him, say "You have till Sunday evening, I want a responsible father for my baby, or I want you packed up and gone."  Then leave his weed for him.  If he doesn't snap out of it throw it out on his own by the deadline, he's probably not going to be responsible enough to trust a child with.|`|0wcKjHIyaa	sounds good,but i would have someone (a guy like a brother,father,cousin) so he won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  You can't trust anybody in this world especially someone who is high all day,you never know what they are thinking.<br>  <br>  good luck though :D|`|UZodNAOkaa	i think its a good plan but sinse hes doing drugs he may try to hurt u so i suggest u bring someone who will be able to protect u in case he tries to hurt u sinse the drugs probably has affected how he thinks|`|jcjXgzt9aa	Sounds good <br>  Good luck <br>  <br>  congratulations with the baby|`|JivLAZH6aa	yeah i think your in the right<br>  <br>  good luck|`|WeSdUJy9aa	Yes!

He will always be a bum.  <br>  You don't need to be taking care of a grown man and yourself and soon your baby girl.  Dump him and don't look back.  <br>  Do you have family and friends to emotionally support you?<br>  It's going to be rough and I'm sure he'll be shocked that you don't want to be with him.  (B/c he's always high and doesn't pay attention when you're talking--trust me, I dated someone like this for 4 years.)<br>  When you talk to him, have someone there with you and make sure that they are there the whole time he is getting his stuff.<br>  Also, you may want to pack his stuff for him b/c he is not going to be motivated to do that.|`|qqKBUOv8aa	i think that sounds good.<br>  wow, that probably takes a lot of effort to come out and say that, especially after all you've been through.  that's good though, you have goals and aspirations in life.  i'm sorry that you have to do this...it's probably reeeeally hard to do.  but yes, i think that sounds like a good way to tell him, and i wish you luck....with that friday, and with your new baby girl. :)<br>  hopefully things look your way.|`|s1zvwm9faa	Wow, you are extremely brave, the world needs more people like you. Let me first of say that you are making the perfect choice. You want your girl to have a nice family, not a high daddy. You need to help your child and your doing it perfectly.<br>  <br>  Now, on to your question. This is SO hard for you and im betting you feel horrible about the whole situation. You should carry on with what you think is the right thing for you to do. This seems to me like a reasonable thing to do. Get your speech together, drink lots of water and tea. This relaxes you a lot! Also, get working on the type of guy that would be perfect for you, then sign into Lavalife. It actually works quite well. My aunt has had a husband for awhile now and she is so in love. It will match you very well. Also, don't fret about his reaction, although, you may want to bring defense whether that be a knife or your fists, he seems like the type of guy who may go crazy, and you're life is more important to you than his. So it just would be a good thing to keep on you just in case somewhere were he wont see it. These sort of things happen a lot. The guy goes NUTS and actually KILLS the girl. This is horrible, and you should be prepared. Place and time seem fine, and what you're gunna say is up to you.

If that was the case, he would likely beat you.<br>  Marijuana is better then alcohol, it just calms the nerves, giving you a false sense of happiness.<br>  Of course there are some consiquesnes, such as not being able to solve puzzles, since it gives you a false sense of happiness, your brain thinks that it doesn't need to make the body happy on its own, so it can lead to not being happy.<br>  Also,<br>  "You don't need to be taking care of a grown man and yourself and soon your baby girl." said the person above me, how exactly do you know its going to be a girl?

DO you want to scare this guy off?  Because you're going about it the right way!  <br>  <br>  You're not in love -it's infatuation and chemical highs in your brain.

Try to calm down and when he's gone, learn to play piano or guitar or something constructive to take you mind off it.

PGanZdtmaa	my parents are single also  i live with my mom also and i get to see my dad every other weekend i was about 3 yrs old when they broke up. i know how you feel, and i have cryed myself to sleep a lot of times because i miss him and i hate to Darem  on the toughts of what it WOULD have been like if that didn'tn happen and it hurts to no that you will never get to turn back the time to see. and i am the oldest of three children and my mother works very hard for the things they want and honestly i feel like a mother sometimes to them. And yes its hard when your freinds have dads and talk about how but just be thankful they get to have a dad. my friends pick on me a lot because i'm like a mother at the age of 16!  and sometimes i hate that fact that im not out going enough to do stuff that  i mite have.and yes i'm sure that someday your mom will want to go out again, but you can't blame her can you? yes it will be different and you might not like him but you never know.i think things happen for a reason, and sometimes it takes us longer  for us to see what god has planed for us! so don't dreed on the stuff that isn't there because you'll miss the time you took from that just be thankful for what you have-thats what i have learned.<br>  <br>  heres a few songs i hope you dont but they made me feel greatful and realize stuff and maybe they'll help you! hope i helped and im so sorry that i wrote so much lol = ) please please please listen to these! = )<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFmHHxXCVg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFmHHxXC...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUiW-zC8qNo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUiW-zC8q...</a>|`|UT2tv5N3aa	i myself no but i had a daughter and was a single parent for a couple of years cos her father left me when i was pregnant he denies he is her father to this day but you have to know deep down its not your fault and maybe you are better off without him remember your mum loves you and you have to both help each other  in time she may date but don't push her into anything i thought i would never meet anyone else but i am married now and have had three more children <br>  good luck|`|qNbHazO6aa	I'm an only child living with a single mom. I haven't seen my father since I was about 2, and my mom never talks about him. I know barely anything about him, and I wish that wasn't so but I don't know how to talk to my mother about it. I think I deserve to know about my father, I'm almost 21 and I'm not going to go out and look for him or anything but I would like to know about him. I know it hurts her to talk about it though. I sometimes feel like I am missing out not having another parent, but I have seen how hard my mother works to give me a good life by herself, even though we have close family she has done everything for me by herself if she could, and I feel that that role model makes me a stronger woman. I think she has some problems that she keeps inside and sometimes they interfere with her letting me grow up (i.e. boyfriends or men in general - I am in a serious relationship and she is having a hard time relaxing about it). It is definitely difficult, but there are also a lot of positive things about it. Try speaking to a trusted person, possibly a therapist, to help you figure out more about why you feel the way you do. You shouldn't beat yourself up over something that you personally had no control over, but if you want to understand it, I think talking to a professional can help you look at it in a way that can bring some important things to light and give you some closure and confidence.
JZabWXGpaa	All wedding dresses run in different sizes.  Most designers have their own size charts.  You need to refer to that size chart if you are ordering a standard size.  In order to do this, you must know your full bust, waist and hip measurements.<br>  <br>  Here is an example of a size chart that has US & UK Sizes<br>  <a href="http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com/size-chart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com/...</a><br>  <br>  You should consider finding an online bridal store that will make the dress just for you according to your measurements.  If the company is legtimate, then the dress will fit you right out of the box and you will save hundreds on alterations.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	It can vary widely, which is why it's a very, very, very bad idea to buy a wedding dress over the internet unless the seller gives the actual measurements, and you know and can take into consideration how loose or tight that specific individual design should be.<br>  <br>  Some manufacturers use what's called "pattern sizing". If you've ever made your own clothes, you know that pattern sizes run big because sizes in patterns haven't changed in 40 years. For instance, if you have a 25-inch waist and take a size 4 in designer wear and a 6 in cheap clothing, you probably need a size 12 in pattern sizes. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, other manufacturers size their dresses like prom dresses, and still others go into vanity sizing, where a woman who would take a size 4 might have to go down to a 2.<br>  <br>  Some dresses are meant to be worn snug, while others are meant to be more flowing. You can't tell that from a photograph either.|`|884v4VhGaa	They will match the sizing chart. Even clothing manufacturers aren't stupid enough to not deliver what they're advertising. <br>  <br>  However, if you're talking about regular dress sizes, they're big. I'm a 16, and my wedding dress is a 12. Your prom dress, if you purchased it from an evening wear store, probably ran about the same amount too large. <br>  <br>  However, like any other clothes, how much you pay for the dress is going to affect what the size is. Also, if you're used to off-the rack (which you obviously aren't, or you wouldn't expect to be able to predict your size based on what you wear) be aware that wedding dresses don't run as large as other off-the-rack clothing does. (At Marks Work Wearhouse I wear a 6-10, which is even further from my actual dress size)|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I find that both bridal gowns and bridesmaids dresses run waaaaay small.  Your best bet is to get yourself measured properly and view the size chart for the dress you want.  If you are at all over the measurement, go up a size and have the dress taken in (say the waist measurement is 30 inches and you measured 31 - - just bump up to the next size).<br>  <br>  I am usually a size 14 or 16 and was measured to fit a size 20 wedding gown (how depressing!)<br>  My sister is a bigger girl, 5ft 11in and big boned.  In regular stores she is an 18 or 20.  Her bridesmaid dress had to be ordered in a size 26.<br>  My size 14 bridesmaid had to order her dress in a size 20.<br>  My size 0 bridesmaid had to order a 6.<br>  My size 6 or 8 bridesmaid had to go to a 12 (she freaked!)|`|AA11082914	Typically, they run small. I wear a 16-18 (depends on the brand- if it's a cheapo from walmart, 18, if it's from fashion bug or old navy, 16), but even an 18 was too tight when i was trying on bridal gowns.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Formal wear typically runs small. Generally, you take your street size and go up 2 sizes. <br>  <br>  However, when ordering over the internet, ALWAYS order by your measurements!|`|HvbIE03saa	Most of the dresses I've been helping my sister try on run way small.<br>  <br>  She's pretty petite (size 2-4) and she was having trouble fitting in size 8 dresses.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Mine ran big.|`|qjQbIxsMaa	Yes. This is why: Alterations cost a fortune. If you know your size, you order it, and then it's too big, they can charge you a couple hundred to fix it.|`|VqilAWDGaa	Wedding dresses run smaller than any other dresses that I know of.|`|6q4E96hgaa	they can custom make the dress for you :cheap-wedding-gowns.com|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It depends on the dress so there is no way to predict. However the sizes that you wear everyday are vanity sizes. Thus you need to be measured at the bridal salon to be able to order the correct size. The dress can be taken in if necessary during alterations but there isn't enough fabric allowance to let it out if you ordered something too small. SO don't be surprised if you wear a 4 in street sizes but you have to order a size 8 wedding dress.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	usually they run small, but not always, i wear 22/24 and my dress is a 20. Also may depend on your undergarments.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I am not a dress person at all. My normal size for jeans is between a 3 and a 5 and my shirt size is a medium but when i went to try on a dress depending on the kind I choose my size was different. I ended up getting a 10. It is crazy because if you never felt fat you would after buying a dress because of how much the size changes. You seem to wear dresses though so I would assume that a prom dress wouldn't be to far off from a wedding dress. Good luck. Be careful when ordering online. make sure they will take returns if they get the size or color wrong because some places do not. or make sure it will get here by the time you need it here in case you need changes made to it.|`|CxRJwJsraa	I think it might depend on where the dress comes from, like which company.<br>  <br>  But,  my experience is that dresses run VERY small. Like, two or three sizes.|`|w1necKzYaa	They usually fit small acctually! they are about 2 sizes smaller than usual dresses!|`|lc2WYfeTaa	No, they usually run small by a size or two!!

EaZm0FELaa	I asked the same q few years ago and i got an answer "a coffin" <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well I would say buy her something she can use, a spa treatment is relaxing for a fewhours and after a few days/weeks your mum would forget that she was even treated. I got my mom some towels with her name on...  and she told me the other day she thinks of me everytime she uses it. <br>  <br>  Also i would suggest something for the kitchen if she is a good or huge cook. <br>  <br>  Or if she's a bussiness woman - a plant or something for her desk like a frame with a photo of the family (you two) <br>  <br>  Or you can get her a nice combo, some nice slippers, pj's towels, a home facial mask or so. <br>  <br>  Some teacups or cutlery can also do the trick, she can use them over and over.<br>  <br>  If she likes gardening some plants would also work<br>  <br>  If she is arty - give her a vocher to a craft store (also any voucher would work)<br>  <br>  Or make her a gift...|`|4iaswP8Kaa	dye for her gray hair...lol, maybe a earings|`|WEKkT4Jtaa	a grave stone jkjk lol make her something Special
cHBcR0Chaa	yea he def. likes you|`|00cAPbToaa	It wasnt that long, lol, people are just lazy...but anyways, it kinda does sound like he likes you, if you want to be 100% sure than ask him up to his face, it does sound like he likes you though, but you gotta be carful with guys cuz he may also want you for himself cuz he doasnt want other guys to get more girls then him, so just watch out he could just be a player, and rebember...just chill out and stop taking lief so serously....good luck hum (:|`|AA11984229	He seems to be interested in you.  Why else would he get jealous when you spend time with other guys.  He's being territorial and protective of you.  But it appears that he's jealous of you hanging out with other guys, which is a bit of a worry.  He can't expect you not to hang out with other guys just because it makes him feel uncomfortable.  Guys don't always know what to say to someone they are interested in so maybe (if you feel the same way) you should sit down with him and have a direct chat.|`|AlDUph0Paa	he likes you but is to scared to ask and  is hoping for you to make the first move, he is trying to stand up to you and stuff to bring you're attention to him , if you like him give him abit more attention. ask him if he likes you when you're alone. you will easily be able too tell if hes is lying because his face wil go bright red.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	I think he likes you a lot, but is a bit shy of asking you directly, arrange to meet him somewhere quiet, look deep into his eyes, if he doesn't look away kiss him.... then enjoy!

The first one, I went back to her after 3 months of breakup, and she did it again.  The second one did it while I was away on a summer job, and I just cut communication with her.  That worked effectively :)|`|s5F745gBaa	Just go up to him and calmly say, "Its over, please leave be, and get out of my life".|`|MkrQvR7saa	Talk to him about it.<br>  Then, if what he tells you doesn't make you feel any better, then you should walk out.<br>  :)|`|d5fcda0b1b369414afee0511cbb3bf20aa	Talk to him about it, get it off your chest. And the move on, nobody deserves a cheater. He was not the one for you so be happy you found out now, and go on with your life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and be strong!|`|AA12346188	No use commenting after a long relationship.<br>  Now whether you take him or leave him, it makes no sense to him.<br>  For you he is a cheater.<br>  For him it is a variety entertainment.<br>  You find such men and women more in this world.<br>  You should not expect sincerity in such illegal friendship where there is no written agreement or authorization.<br>  This is just like: 'ENJOY & FORGET" relationship.|`|skSzDIlwaa	i would talk to him first just to see if he denys it then he might be lying or telling the truth. if he looks you in the eyes and say no then he is telling the truth but if he doesn't and makes a big deal out of it then you know he is lying. i would dump him right there cause no girl needs to get hurt by a jacka** that cheated on her. well good luck
skSzDIlwaa	well when i first saw my husband i just knew he was the one that i could date for a while then have a family. even he said the same thing to me as well. 2 years later we did get married and have a baby boy. so there is such thing as love in first sight cause i had it.|`|be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi dude,<br>         Ofcourse yes... everyone will surely have their love at first sight in their lifetime atleast once...<br>  And coming to date after getting attracted is the next scene that happens once attracted...|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Yes, it has happened several times.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Yes, but haven't managed to date them... ><"|`|vkDKUCOZaa	Yep that happend with my last BF it was just fate, we have brok up since, yet i still see him every day and there is still something there.

It's great if it goes well, but soul crushing when it doesn't.
za9b8cHKaa	Hmm ... I've always been faithful and I've always dated people who were faithful and never gave me reason believe otherwise.<br>  <br>  But ... judging from conversations with my friends and their past experiences, I'd it is pretty even. It usually occurs because a, there is something wrong with the relationship or b, because one partner is too immature to cope with being in that relationship. Then again, I've never been in that situation, so I can't say for sure.|`|AA11447210	Really depends on the couple. Nature wired males to want to spread their seed, and females to want to bond with the male they have sex with. Based on that, the guy is more likely to cheat out of sheer desire for variety. Women do cheat also, but typically for more emotional reasons...if they don't feel they are loved or appreciated, they may seek out (or get sucked in by) someone who will fill that void. They are less likely to cheat just to seek sex or sexual variety.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	girls because they take relationship much more serious than guys.|`|AA12077420	Girls.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It depends on the person. <br>  In Evolutionary Psychology, it will more likely be the male because he wants to spread his sperm around so he can get his genes all over the place. Women on the other hand are picky and want the best; usually faithful.|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	Most likely the girl! Guys cheat more cuz they need variety!
MkKvGdxKaa	I havent lost friends this way, just people i thought were friends!!! If they lived next door, i would probably be amicable to a point, say hello at the door etc but have nothing to do with socially anymore.

9a4924d340e5a96444675e7bf7940883aa	I have alot of quotes I've encountered.<br>  <br>  I Corinithians 13 is AMAZING<33<br>  <br>  well, here it comes:<br>  <br>  1. Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.<br>  --Anais Nin <br>  <br>  2. If you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things you lack. If you don't have it, no matter what else there is, it's not enough.<br>  --Ann Landers<br>  <br>  **WARNING: LONG QUOTE**<br>  3. Love, like truth and beauty, is concrete. Love is not fundamentally a sweet feeling; not, at heart, a matter of sentiment, attachment, or being "drawn toward." Love is active, effective, a matter of making reciprocal and mutually beneficial relation with one's friends and enemies.<br>  <br>  Love creates righteousness, or justice, here on earth. To make love is to make justice. As advocates and activists for justice know, loving involves struggle, resistance, risk. People working today on behalf of women, blacks, lesbians and gay men, the aging, the poor in this country and elsewhere know that making justice is not a warm, fuzzy experience. I think also that sexual lovers and good friends know that the most compelling relationships demand hard work, patience, and a willingness to endure tensions and anxiety in creating mutually empowering bonds.<br>  <br>  For this reason loving involves commitment. We are not automatic lovers of self, others, world, or God. Love does not just happen. We are not love machines, puppets on the strings of a deity called "love." Love is a choice -- not simply, or necessarily, a rational choice, but rather a willingness to be present to others without pretense or guile. Love is a conversion to humanity -- a willingness to participate with others in the healing of a broken world and broken lives. Love is the choice to experience life as a member of the human family, a partner in the dance of life, rather than as an alien in the world or as a deity above the world, aloof and apart from human flesh.<br>  --Carter Heyward<br>  <br>  4. Whoso loves, believes the impossible.<br>  --Elizabeth Barring Browning<br>  <br>  5.Love doesn't make the world go 'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.<br>  --Philip P. Jones<br>  <br>  6. "I was a child, and she was a child,<br>       in this kingdom by the sea.<br>       But we loved with a love that was more than love<br>       I and my Annabel Lee"<br>  --adapted from 'Annabel Lee' by Edgar Allan Poe<br>  <br>  7. Love is like the wind. You cant see it but you can feel it .<br>  --A walk to Remember<br>  <br>  8. "Don't settle for the guy who does everything you ask and kisses your behind. Go for the guy that pushes you buttons, but you couldn't be without him. Love isn't meant to be perfect, its meant to be worth it."<br>  --I'm not sure where I saw this.<br>  <br>  9. Where there is love there is life.<br>  --Ghandi<br>  <br>  i hope these help!<br>  <br>  <3 :] !

You are your best friend. However, if you need to meet other friends besides you, there a lots of places that you can go to meet them. For instance, if you take a class, you can meet people especially if you choose to learn a new language. Find a hobby, such as tennis or volleyball. There, you'll also find friends. Your local church usually have activities that allow people to interact with each other. How about your local Coffee houses? Don't be afraid to start a conversation. Don't be afraid to smile either. Soon, you have all the friends that you want. It's much easy than you think. You just have to make the effort.

A lot of the time there a pain in the ***! Having lots of friends won't make you much happier, it'll just distract you from your own problems temporarily.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're projecting this "negative" persona, possible friends may not happen as you appear too clingy when someone gives you any attention.<br>  <br>  So, to cut a long story short, I'd find out what is making you unhappy inside and try to resolve that. Get a hobby, join a local sport team.<br>  <br>  When you feel better inside yourself, friends will come to you instead of you seeking them out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, chin up!
AA11662302	It is just the sad state in this world in. Love doesn't mean what it used to. It does not mean someone is insecure if they do not want their mate to be faithful and not look at porn. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. You make vows to be faithful. FORSAKING ALL OTHERS. What the heck do people think that means? I love my husband. I give him all of the sex and respect he deserves. He has absolutely NO reason to go ANYWHERE else for any kind of sexual activity because I give him all he can handle. I am completely secure in our relationship and with myself. Wanting him to abstain from porn has nothing to do with my self-esteem. I love him, he is mine, I am his. PERIOD. It is a two way street. I don't go anywhere else for sex, neither does he. We are both happily married, there is no reason to go anywhere else. That is the way it is supposed to be.|`|kbz5S3waaa	I'm okay with porn as long as he asks me before hand (not ask me if he can watch it, but ask me if i want to f*ck...)<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  and no, I think divorce is so high because of nagging whining spouses that don't give their s/o any space to do their own thing. It's becoming less tolerable in todays society, no one wants to be with a whiner...|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It's usually only viewed as disrespectful by those who are insecure in their relationship.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I would be upset if my husband looked at other naked women, porn, or text messaged other girls.  I have certain standards and I won't compromise just to please someone.  Modesty and fidelity are important to me and if my husband didn't respect my feelings we wouldn't be together.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  My dad doesn't look at other naked women, porn, or send text messages to other girls.  He is faithful, respects, and loves my mom.  My mom also loves and respects my dad.|`|GvamTVqAaa	My husband does not look at porn, go to stri clubs etc, and he knows I would not stand for any of it for a second.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i agree with you .. but the fun is in the looking ...|`|e0ba0109fe4dec17f5724e5ab4f7544baa	looking is not a problem I look too<br>  <br>  any contact is not OK<br>  <br>  My self respect & confidence level? off the charts|`|i1rDJY2aaa	My husband and I look at porn together occasionally for fun.<br>  <br>  When he and I were engaged, I found out that he was talking to an ex-girlfriend, and even sent her flowers for her birthday.

I called off the engagement because of the deception, the cheating, and most of all -the lying.<br>  <br>  We eventually got married, on the condition that he never talk to her again, and if we have friends of the opposite sex, we tell each other everything.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I don't think that watching porn is why the divorce rate is so high in this country.<br>  <br>  I think that women who are adamantly against porn should choose better dating partners.  Other than incidental sophomoric nudity in "comedies" like BeerFest, my husband doesn't watch nekkid women.  That amount I can tolerate and find his boyish reaction to it to be amusing.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would not tolerate a husband who watched XXX porn or even single X porn.  That decision was determined during the courtship.  Viewing pornography is not an attribute that I want in a husband, so I would not tolerate it in a boyfriend. The bf would have been ditched a long time ago.<br>  <br>  I also would not have continued dating someone who text messaged other women.  If I weren't treated like a queen and with total respect during the courtship, why would he suddenly start treating me like one post-marriage.  <br>  <br>  Most husbands do not suddenly develop these traits. They had these poor qualities and disrespectful attitude all along.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	my fiance does and i watch porn. we dont usually do it together either. i'm fine with it. i think it's about yoru comfort level. i don think there is a right or wrong answer (as long as the porn is LEGAL and not freaky). i think eveything is fine IF you talk about this stuff w/ your partner BEFORE you marry and decide how you want to live your marriage and your expecations of marriage.  <br>  <br>  porn is just porn. porn doesnt make me want to cheat. i dont want the guys that are on there. if anything, temptation is more the guy that you get bagels from every morning or something like that.<br>  <br>  now, that being said, if someone is ADDICTED to porn and cannot function sexually without porn, then THAT is a problem. and i would NOT be okay with that at all.<br>  <br>  ps. i'm confident. i dont see what that has to do with anything. you act as if i allow my man to cheat on me. he nor i go into chat room and have cyber sex or anything. we just watch porn. and not even lots of it. but sometimes it's fun. i like porn and i'm a woman. some people like it. i know CRAZY.|`|7cjqT33Baa	There are different kinds of marriages.

That way we can focus on each other and share a deeper intimacy.  I agree with you completely on those women that accept it have low self-esteem and no self-respect.

I, like you, am amazed at the NUMBER of YOUNG couples spending much time with porn, on the computer, phone sex, etc.  It's just astounding and I don't, in all my years on this earth, remember marriage and couples ever dwelling on this issue AS MUCH as I see right here on Yahoo...<br>  It speaks to the boredom of many here, mostly men...and the root cause to my way of thinking has more to do with a dissatisfaction with their choices in life, yet alone, not being able to think beyond their "peter".  How pathetic is that?  VERY.<br>  <br>  I would suggest they take their life and examine it and fill the needs in a myriad of other ways that release sexual tension, the least not being - being intimate with the one they so call, profess to "love".<br>  <br>  It's a raging epidemic...and while I don't necessarily condone it I don't condemn it either on occasion (i.e., sex video, magazines, etc.)- but we don't seem to be talking "occasion" do we?  These guys are at it seemingly day and night!  -What I think is that they need to get a life that includes physical outlets...not just sex, but biking, running, other forms of exercise and satisfaction.  While survival is our greatest instinct?  I would submit sex at certain times in our lives can be the second greatest instinct next to food for some of these people  - the difference being there really are ways to channel sexual tension without so much emphasis on porn and the like I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Most sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|lJhl3wLAaa	There is a big difference between looking at porn and texting/communicating with other women. I think it is perfectly normal to look at porn. I do it too. Sometimes we do it together. We totally respect each other. Men are very visual. Women are more intellectual and can fantasize easier to get excited. I don't care if my husband wants to look at pictures to masturbate. I think it is healthy and normal. I'm not offended by it. I am not insecure. I have great self respect. I'm very confident in our relationship and with my sexuality. <br>  Now, if he became addicted and it started to affect our life in some way then I would have an issue with it.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	Men usually do harmless men things, but only to certain limit when he's married. <br>  <br>  Like my husband, he still watches porn, but most of the time he would wait so we can watch it together. <br>  <br>  He occasionally would go through his brother's playboy collection to look at naked pictures...<br>  <br>  However, he would never text msg to girls or do things that will put our relationship on the line.  <br>  <br>  In a relationship -- i guess you have to draw the line to where they can still do the things that they do but not to harm and being disrespectful to your relationship.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Different people have different kinds of relationships. Some woman don't mind it as much as others. Depends on what your relationship is based on.<br>  Personally I would be offended if my husband rather look at other woman than me, and I would definitely have a problem with him talking to other woman. So I married the type of man that wouldn't do those things. And he doesn't.<br>  Some woman marry men who they know disrespect them, in the hopes that they can change them. But you don't marry a person to make them into who you want them to be. You marry them because you like who they already are.<br>  So....in retrospect. It's up to you, who you choose to be with, what you choose to put up with. If you don't like how a man acts, don't marry him.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Yes I do find it disrespectful and I'm a guy by the way, so I'll probably get thumbs down for saying this from a bunch of immature guys but everyones entitled to their own opinion.<br>  <br>  I'm not against porn but I think it should be watched in moderation, there should be a balance, and texting some other girls is definitely not okay. That's treading on dangerous grounds.|`|oauYuhvDaa	I believe a man shouldn't lust after anyone but his wife.  Yes, porn is wrong and so many people will disagree with me.  I don't know when as a society we became so complacent about pornography.  It is not because I have a low self esteem that I don't like it either.  It is just wrong at a very basic level.<br>  Although technology in and of itself is a good thing, I think it has also made it easier to be pulled down the slippery slope of unfaithfulness.  Text messaging, Myspace, etc.  And yes, it has definitely contributed to the divorce rate.  <br>  The things that people view as "normal" just astounds me.  Where have the morals gone?|`|pfisYml0aa	i love porn....and my wife. she doesn't like me looking at porn, so i don't, but i find the site of my wife to be the sexiest thing that i have EVER seen, and think that she is the most Beautiful woman that i  have ever been with. I don't see a problem with it, but she says that it makes her feel bad, so i don't look.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I didn't start looking at porn until I had been married for 10 years and blue-balled for 8 of the 10.  I think my wife knows but doesn't say anything because she's tired of me looking for sex all the time.<br>  <br>  This way she can save her breath and doesn't have to deal with rejecting me all the time.  I just go straight to the computer after she goes to bed.<br>  <br>  I'd much rather be with her, but it is what it is, and i get tired of wacking off by myself.|`|AA11356977	My ex did that crap to me then cheated. He had the issuses not me. But I wansnt going to let anyone treat me that way. My guy now feels thats disrespectful, knows what I lived with so he never has treated me that way. People justifiy things and give into them and wonder how they ended up cheating... Duh ,some doors need to remain shut. And by the way I like my guys qualities. Thats another reason people are not happy they marry someone they think will or want to change. You better like them the way they are before you get married.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I am 100% with you, I thought I was the only one that thought that way, because each time I would post and answer opposing to that perversity, inmorality, filth and craziness, I would get lots of thumbs down, which really made me so sad to see how love and respect is disappearing  from today's circle of relationships.|`|9KIICFdIaa	I think that if they were happily married, they wouldn't be doing these things and probably shouldn't have the time. You need to spend your time with your wife, kids and do what needs done to support them. If you are doing what needs to be done, then they wouldn't have time.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	That is definitely NOT common in my marriage. That is disrespectful and these women AND men who approve of that must be in a loveless marriage. In my home, we call that infidelity|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	i don't have a problem with my man looking at pics or watching porn, we do that together i would however have a problem with him texting women....that is cheating to me...<br>  <br>  ADD ON ~ unless of course he is texting a woman to join us in a 3some!  <wink wink>|`|wIkGLOgnaa	some of you woman just need to lighten up......... it's not necessarily disrespect it's like you window shopping, like to look but don't want to buy it, so just give it a rest!!!!!!!!!!|`|6BSHkiugaa	I think its very direspectful to look or flirt or anything.  My Father never treated my Mother that way and I wont accept that behavior!!|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Everyone and their relationships are different. You can't say that someone has no self respect or self esteem because they don't flip out like mommy dearest when their husband watches porn. Texting and flirting with other girls is NOT ok...at all. Period. But porn? Come on! I think it's YOU that has the low self esteem. How are you gonna be intimidated by a chick (that clearly is a whore) in a movie that your husband will NEVER meet? Just because he watches porn DOES NOT mean that he doesn't love you. Men are visual and they like to LOOK at sex. So do I. Get over yourself and your idealized grandiose ideals of marriage. I hate women that think once they get married that their husbands are suddenly transformed into PERFECT men who "only have eyes for them". A hot woman walks by, they'll probably look. As long as you're confident and know that your husband wouldn't dare touch her, and may not even really WANT to, then what's the harm? I think it's the insecure low self esteem chicks all up in arms about this porn thing. Get a grip.|`|OXtYMoVLaa	I totally agree with you and people that say it's ok because at least they're not touching or anything are ******* morons. Ok, what is the first step into liking someone? You flirt or make an effort to keep seeing them so you can think about them. I mean come on, how did everyone meet their husbands/wives or boyfriends/girlfriends? You see each other, talk, flirt, go out, etc. With how the world is today by saying you should let your man do that otherwise you're not secure with yourself, well no wonder the cheating rates are so high. Society has given everyone the excuse to cheat, they've provided everyone with a rule of no touch just look but they don't understand that eventually that no touch thing doesn't last long. Ever heard of curiosity killed the cat? Duh. Everyone thinks that as long as you keep the leash short your man will love you more because you gave him so much freedom. That kind of freedom should be when you're SINGLE. I don't get the world. Even this girl the other day left a message saying " I gave my boyfriend everything, even a threesome and he still cheats on me. Why?" Um huh i wonder, because you gave his mind the thought and the opportunity to pursue other things. I totally agree with you and i just say everyone that doesn't agree with this deserves the things that will come to them.|`|RC6Dn6zoaa	Looking at porn/magazines  can hurt a person who feels that their spouse is "lusting" on the inside, that can be very painful, i mean to assume that your spouse is looking at other sources to be satisfied, you just kind of feel that they are bored with you and it really does hurt. This situation is not initially brought about because you are an insecure person, but it can definatly lead to insecurity and feeling left out and curious. In my opinion, i just think that in the start of a relationship if this is something that you both enjoy and you both are aware of it, then cool, great, more power to you,however, if you never knew about his/her secret fantasies it could end up hurting you in the end...|`|8zqO2ZOJaa	Looking at naked women and watching porn may just be fantasizing and harmless. On the other hand, if your husband starts to neglect you in bed or tries to meet someone else, you've got problems.|`|yFTev2Pyaa	turn his head to you next time hes doing any of that stuff and make his eyes bugg then it will slowly start changing.
IPS3hWweaa	Just laugh with them!<br>  <br>  "Haha! I can't believe I lost to a girl!"<br>  <br>  Or look at your arm all funny and with a surprised look on your face and yell at it! "What!? You let me down B!"<br>  <br>  They laugh at you to get you upset, but show them that you find it funny too and they won't find it as funny anymore. That's what I would do.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Ask them to arm wrestle her and see how they fair against her|`|fPN2KV1Taa	Just ignore them. It amazes me how immature and silly your friends are. So what? Women have beaten men with a lot of things. Getting beat by a girl doesn't necessarily mean you're weak. All of us have our strengths and our weaknesses. It just so happened that your left hand was a weakness, and to her it was her strength. So, just ignore your friends. Let them try the same thing to the same girl and see how things work out. xD|`|dlUgJ5Obaa	OMG!! just OMG, ROFLMAO, yeah I saw u loose it :D and my class was talking about it for some time but eventually they forgot, but oh man wtf I saw u, u just looked weak , I didn't think u could win it at the time.. but be strong, forget it|`|SBpl494Uaa	lol, just laugh with them, I mean come on it is funny.

I f you make a big deal out of it you are giving your friends ammo to use against you and they will keep doing it because you are letting them do it.<br>  look, if the chick is strong, she's strong. give her her credit and move on. you manlyness is no lesser for it. besides, you'll look really foolish if you tried to beat her again and lost|`|tnfJ5kMkaa	..ignore it..it just a game and important is that you behave a real gentleman as giving way to a lady whereas,... the other guy hurt her right hand..|`|k3OD4BX9aa	oh damn I'd feel like s*** if I lose to a girl uhhh just thinking about it makes me shiver I'm gonna go work out NOW!!!!!!!

Know that she isn't as mature all the time as she would seem! And there would be legal issues with it but as long as you spin it right and keep it serious enough to be worth it and not serious enough to get bored or arrested it should work out !

IPS3hWweaa	She is intentionally doing that to you! SEE it for what it is.<br>  <br>  She makes herself feel better by putting you down, that's just how some people are. Ignore it completely if you want to stay friends with her, but its better just to spend your time with someone else who doesn't do that to you.|`|fPN2KV1Taa	I'm sorry but I'm not sure if she really is your friend. You just need to back off because people like those lower your self-esteem. Just don't get affected. She's just jealous that you attract guys more than she does. :) Insecurity can make people do crazy things. Just avoid her and make new and better friends, because I know real friends would be happy for you instead of getting jealous at you.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  You might wanna straighten things out though. Talk to her. Tell her how you feel. You'll never know. :/|`|NZmvHYY9aa	Any "friend" who makes you feel bad about yourself is not a true friend. Likely she's jealous because you're better-looking than she is. So quit letting her ride on your beauty and take advantage of your kind nature. The fact that you haven't punched in the face is amazing to me.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Find something wrong with her and point it out and mess with her about it that's what i do when my friends do it to me.|`|OMTMv29Taa	I wouldnt call someone who does that a friend.|`|AA11832245	First of all you need to stop worrying about what she thinks. your friend is probably jealous that you get attention from guys and she does`nt. The problem is with your friend, you are not doing anything wrong. Talk to your friend about the way she treats you and if she denies what you say or is not even willing to change, then it is time to find better friends.|`|DOrQQamjaa	hey!!!<br>  u know what!i guess u must be so special n pretty..<br>  there's must be a reson why is she doing that to u...<br>  n the reason is...u are soooooo.......prettyyy...!!!!right???<br>  so..dont be stress up okey?she's so jealous of u...<br>  u are so lucky...|`|5Vzym033aa	thats easy<br>  <br>  u are who you are if ur freind cant acpt that then they are not ur freind and u need to kick them to the curb|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Sounds like a great friend.....What are you doing???As we get older we learn not to listen to idiots!|`|AA11218614	ok step 1: have you told her your feelings: on what she does cause if you haven't she might just keep doing it or she would make you look like a fool in front of every1 until she gets what she wants.<br>  step 2: ignore: it if it gets to a certain point that you can not handle anymore ignore her or just tell her you have had enough and that you do such nice things to her so why don't u return the favour? u might have a known thing for bad attitude but it doesn't mean that u have to hurt me just to prove a point.<br>  step 3: what u should get for help: if u feel ur not the only one that gets hurt from her then try and b friends with all the people that get hurt from her and kind of form a group that don't like her but only to a certain point show her what u have been through cause i reckon its unfair that u are nice to her and she is mean to you and the rest of them<br>  step 4: seek: if that doesn't work go ask people that care bout u for help and if she still hurts you then just be straight up with her.|`|a59vFP3laa	OMG!!! i have the same exact problem!!! I have a friend just like that it is so creepy!!! Just like you i would complaint her and she would say nothing  nice about me. She would make fun of me all the time and i NEVER made fun of her. I was getting really annoyed with her and i was starting to think she was totally jealous of me for some reason. So three days ago she played a really mean joke on me and i had a feeling it was her all along and i told her if she was the one doing this to me she would be dead to me. Turns out is was her i haven't talked to her in 3 days. I will be standing right next to her and our other friend will be between us and she will start talking bad about stuff i love like the Jonas Brothers or The Secret Life of an American Teenager when she know i cant stand that she makes fun of it (not that she didn't make fun of these things before) I am just not her friend anymore i am pretty sure we are done for good. My life is so much better without her. We have awkward moments now and then since we arnt talking but i am hoping that will go way soon. <br>  <br>  I advise you do the same thing next time you say something nice to her and she repys with an insult ask her what her problem is. Tell her that your sick of her negitivity. Tell her that you dont put on too much makeup and that you love your clothes and u love your hair. Then tell her your done taking her crap and walk away. The dont talk to her till you get an apolagy and DONT accept it untill you are absolutly sure she means it and she is gonna stop making fun of you.( i am guessing that it gonna be a while, so start hanging out with other friends and if you dont have any other friends make some new ones, dont let her think you need her)<br>  <br>  When my friend tried to apologize to me she started laughing and giggling. So i just walked away. She thinks it funny that i am mad. She thinks i need her when i definatly dont. They need us not the other way around and you have to show her that.
b7yvPsiVaa	This question made me giggle because it reminded me of my current boyfriend back when we were in high school senior year!<br>  He used to do the same thing. And his girlfriend was actually kind of my friend! And I would think, no maybe I'm just being stupid and he's not looking at me, but it was TOO obvious!  Then 4 days later, I find out his girlfriend broke up with him but she had planned to do it for a while. He was looking at me the whole time because things weren't working out with her and he thought I was really pretty!<br>  Anyways he ended up getting the courage to talk to me and ended up togheter in the middle of our freshman year in college.

It't ok to look at the menu as long as you don't order dinner.|`|FqOewVGcaa	he is looking for his next girl...you! or he knows something about you.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	He either thinks you are very pretty or you smell really really really bad.|`|XTj0LP6gaa	He likes the way you look.|`|dV6nEBUdaa	he likes you in a way <br>  but if he liked you a lot he wouldn't be with his girl|`|qmMCGKl9aa	just because a guy has a girl doesn't mean anything to him.<br>  he likes you.|`|901gcIS1aa	hes thinks your a foxy lady.|`|EgfL2c86aa	the first answer pretty much says it all. guys (even my boyfriend i'm sure) have "wandering eyes" nothing we do can change it.|`|K0LqZe70aa	he thinks ur hot?|`|JWNzoksmaa	just b/c he has a gf doesn't mean he's blind.  maybe he's not happy with his gf...or maybe he's looking for a little somethin' somethin' on the side.  you know he keeps his gf for appearances and keeps you for "fun".  it happens all the time...lol if you're confused now...wait till you get older and enter "the game".
IPS3hWweaa	He probably thought you were going to play some kind of cruel prank on him. If he really doesn't have that many friends it would just pop up in his head that people who don't normally talk to him would be trying to pull something on him when all of a sudden they start treating him nicely.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	When will people learn that looks aren't everything?<br>  <br>  He didn't reject you because of the way you look - you are very attractive - he rejected you because he wasn't that hard up.<br>  <br>  He didn't want to be dated out of pity, dear.|`|RlCKkyvJaa	He could have been intimidated by uyou.<br>  Maybe because you were a year older he just thought you were being nice to him in a "talk to the loner" way..<br>  or you just felt sorry for him. <br>  <br>  He may not have gotten that you liked him.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	I.Do.Not.See.A.Picture.<br>  <br>  It could be your appearance.

The only way you will know is to be bold and ask him and tell him you like him.|`|Jhr68T0baa	maybe he feels threatened by you, if hes the "loser type" he might feel embarassed or think your joking around with him. he doesnt want to be humiliated. he needs to know he can trust you.|`|1WSFNX35aa	Probably gay, christian or really lacking in confidence.
y1Fihj3Maa	I know how hard it is to have an empty nest.  I was terribly lonely for along time.  I found some new things to do.  Volunteer. Become a big sister.  Volunteer at a single parent resource centre.  Renew your marriage vows, you will like the privacy that the empty nest provides.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for the loss of your child.

AA11185479	Have you tried asking her why?  Not in a belligerent, "what insane reason could you possibly have for forbidding this" sort of way, but in a polite, sincere, "I really want to understand your point of view" sort of way.<br>  <br>  What is it about these things, or more likely, the WAY you do these things, that bothers her?  Does she think you are wasting money, wasting time, going about it the wrong way or at the wrong time?  <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong or unusal about shaving or waxing at your age, but frankly blush is rather unnecessary at your age.  Blush is more helpful for older women who have lost some of that youthful glow.  Just because beauty magazines tell you to buy it doesn't mean you really need it.<br>  <br>  She does have a legitimate concern about boxing.  Yes, female boxing in getting more popular now, but it is still a dangerous activity no matter what your age or gender.  Is this a passing impulse on your part, or a genuine dedicated passion?

At least then you could put a "spin" on it and say you were "trying" to be responsible by paying them yourself.<br>  <br>  You know your parents and what solution you can live with.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>   "Good kids" don't jeopardize INOCENT PEOPLES LIVES (think of a car w/ a kid in the back seat dude) by SPEEDING through STOP SIGNS.|`|n3Exo1raaa	Tell him to look at your Yahoo answers questions. = )

dFUqPcWKaa	I'd recommend asking your gyno for advice in this situation. Explain the problem. Chances are, if there are other people who have this condition, they have the same problems. Either way, it's definitely worth asking about.. couldn't hurt, right?<br>  <br>  And convince the fiance to play, play, play until his tongue, fingers, and pecker fall off! The best defense is a good offense? lol Try a little anal stimulation? Be open with one another, and try anything within both of your boundaries. Sooner or later you'll figure something out. :)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No hood, that's interesting. Anyway, it's possible your clit will get less sensitive in time with more touching. If his fingers are wet is it any easier? Or he could stimulate your clit through thin cloth or something that might make it feel less sensitive.<br>  <br>  Other than that you guys just need to try all different stuff, try to orgasm without your clit, or from his tongue, just keep experimenting and talking basically.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|OHfZFR31aa	Try to find other ways that he can stimulate you to orgasm - oral sex, manual stimulation of your g-spot, even certain sexual positions.|`|B2j7BOLtaa	Clitoris stimulation isn't the only way for a woman to have an orgasm. You have a G-SPOT that's inside of your vagina. If you guy work together to find it like maybe he could finger f**K you till it's found then he can put his stuff in and stimulate your G-spot during intercourse. I prefer clitoris stimulation over intercourse, but once the G-spot is found you will have to chang your bed sheets! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|dB2fqrCgaa	Find another way to get an orgasm, maybe tell him to just have sex, and use oral, if youre not too sensitive.<br>  <br>  And im sorry to hear about your clitoral hood
AleWgjvPaa	Try to limit the time that you spend with them and talk to them. My mother-in-law is an utter pain in the neck so I just make sure that my husband answers the phone when it's her calling (I'm either out or busy) and we only go over to visit them about once every two weeks (move to another town, it'll help. And no, I'm not joking). <br>  <br>  At least your fiance knows that you're having problems with them so he can help you cope with them. Unfortunately, when you are talking to them you have to nod and smile a whole lot just so that you don't make your fiance's life hell. My MIL keeps telling me how to cook and bake and such things so I just nod and smile and pretty much forget about it as soon as we stop talking. My husband finds it hilarious so he doesn't give it away that I'm not taking all her advice on how to feed him.<br>  <br>  And ditto on feeling like an incubator! My MIL has bought me truck loads of folic acid and multi-vitamins and keeps reminding me to take it so that the babies will be healthy. Even though she knows that we're not looking at having children for about the next two years. But I just nod and smile and throw the tablets at the back of the cupboard.<br>  <br>  Something else that might help is to find a neutral friend, someone who is your friend and not really your fiance's, and use them as a sympathetic ear for you to vent in. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|a4f5eff9502035e4660ac34d96e762a7aa	just shoot them now and avoid all the misery that's coming down the road ... but seriously you should listen to them and thier concerns. It doesn't mean you have to act on their ideas, Sometimes listening is enough.|`|B24W8w43aa	You need to get used to their style because you've got them for the rest of your life. If you find them irritating now wait until you are actually married..|`|iDfRTLklaa	It sounds like your in laws are the traditional type, and think the girls side of the family should be the one organising and paying for everything.  If that's the way they feel, I would just organise what ever wedding I wanted, and be grateful that they have decided to give you some money towards the wedding.  I would also only discuss the wedding with people that seem interested, and not ones that don't want to know.|`|nEQZtD7Daa	You know what they say, "in-laws are out-laws"  and nothing could be further from the truth.  So, always take the high road with them and do it with gusto and a BIG smile.   Be gracious, kind and understanding when you state your agenda or polite objections when they attempt to undermine, interfere or even ruine your plans.   <br>  <br>  Remember, it's your wedding and you're in charge not only of the wedding, but of your own feelings.  Nobody can make you feel bad unless you allow it.   For every human being on the face of the planet happiness comes from within.  The actions of others can make us feel sad or happy; but, ultimatley it's how we choose to react that makes the difference in how we feel.    <br>  <br>  Now, try not to step into the cow-pies as you maneuver your way through this blessed event.|`|AA11569882	This is a problem that plagued our mothers and grandmothers, right down through the ages!  I don't know what the solution is, to be honest, my fiance and I are planning a wedding and all I want to do is elope and get away from it all!<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a magic cure, just learn to find a way to deal with it - whether it means ignoring their every comment or giving them specific tasks.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Don't go through with the great big wedding.

Our 'flowers' come in all kinds of shapes and sizes and a lot of girls/women are worried that they are not normal. Maybe you should ask your mum or an older sister you can trust? Otherwise, I really advise you to see a doctor. If you are really different and there is something that can help you then you need to act!<br>  Otherwise you will feel embarrassed (maybe about nothing) for the rest of your life and never have a sexual life? That would be such a waste.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	You probably have a prominent clitoris, if it sticks out from a 'hood' at the top front of your vagina, is very sensitive, and feels good when you touch it... it is your clitoris.<br>  Having a prominent clitoris is good, it can give you lots of great sexual satisfaction as it is stimulated during intercourse, enjoy it!|`|4T9fZzITaa	are you sure? <br>  maybe it is your clit.. if you've been messing around <br>  then that can actually cause some looseness and bring down some stuff. well if i were you i'd look at some pictures of a penis and one of a girl who is a bit loose [i know how this sounds but its the only way since you dont want to see a doc] and compare. i'm sure its not what you think.|`|00cAPbToaa	uhm, defiantly go see a docter, dont be emberassed trust me doctors go through alot everyday there used to those kinds of situtions, just chilax...everything will be alright :)|`|c6FrTkFRaa	basically go see a doctor.

el8yX5q3aa	This isn't the time to tapdance around a situation.  If you are close friends then tell her you know she is doing drugs and want to help her as much as you can.  That does not mean enabling her..but HELPING her find a way out of this.  <br>  <br>  Start by telling her you will go to the school counselor with her to start...then she has to tell her parents and get some help.<br>  <br>  People who self medicate are those in great emotional pain.  They can't cope and they turn to drugs and other addictions to numb the pain so they don't feel anything.  That is the purpose of drugs.<br>  <br>  She needs intervention and counseling and she isn't going to get out of this without it.<br>  <br>  You need to stand firm with her and tell her it is time...and you will be there every step of the way if she wants help.  If not then if you love her....you should be strong enough to go to her parents and tell her everything you think you know !  It isn't an easy decision and you might lose her as a friend...but you could and most likely will save her life.  Be content with that.  <br>  <br>  How would you like it if she overdosed one time and died?  You would carry that guilt forever wondering if you should have told someone.<br>  <br>  Being a friend isn't just patting someone on the back and keeping secrets all the time...it means BEING someone who cares and someone who follows around like  mice.  It means being strong enough to withstand the friendship and when in dangerous situations or someplace where you KNOW in your heart you should help....you should do that.<br>  <br>  If your friendship cannot stand the test of time....remember this...not everyone is meant to be in your life forever...everyone is there for a reason...maybe you are in her life for the reason to help her save her life and future.  She is your friend for a reason too...we tend to compliment each other when we pick friends...we have certain strengths and they compliment the weaknesses of those we are with.  that is why opposites attract so well....they have what we lack....and we provide what they lack.  <br>  <br>  Right now she lacks strength and is depressed and needs help.  YOU SEE IT...but do you have the courage to do something about it.?  If not tell your parents and ask them to go with you...it will make a better statement to them that this is serious.<br>  <br>  good luck honey...you have a lot on you and no matter what you do...this is going to hurt you.  If you stay quiet...you will hurt...and if you help you will hurt.  TELL HER THAT...and then HELP HER!  At least you aren't one of those so called friends who do nothing but claim they love her.  Love is hard...it makes hard decisions and sometimes we have to take them on.  THis is life threatening....or could be.  It is serious.  YOU KNOW THAT!|`|PlRYgRcoaa	Mind your own business, she probably didn't tell you cause you got a big mouth.'|`|rPoKRm8gaa	I think helping her is more important then her finding out you know. Tell her parents, no matter what she says. SHE NEEDS HELP! Also, if you see her doing it, take it away from her. Educate her on how bad it is. Show her nasty pictures, and tell her that this is what she's doing to herrself. Feed her, because if she's too thin, noone knows what will happen. Help her in every possible way, and don't forget to tell her parents immediately! Good luck, and I hope I helped!|`|STY5pSAsaa	if she's smoking weed than she isn't losing weight she'd be gaining!<br>  now if it's coke than she'd loose weight.<br>  anyways, just tell her she's acting weird.<br>  or..<br>  call her a crack head and see how she responds hahaha|`|9A2qByAUaa	Doing what drugs? If it's weed, it's minor. Otherwise, try get her to admit she has a problem than get help.|`|fPN2KV1Taa	Talk to her, just 2 of you alone. Maybe in a place where you guys always hang out. Try to invite your other friend too. Make the conversation simple and normal. Ask her, "I just noticed you were getting thinner, what are you doing?". If she looks like she's hiding something, tell her to be honest with you because that's what friends do. That might get her lightened up and finally tell you the truth. :) But that doesn't matter. You should be worrying about her situation. Get her help and tell her parents. She should be off of the thing before she gets TOO THIN.|`|fJ0csRIIaa	When you say in school, I assume high school. When I was younger I drifted from my usual group of friends when I started doing drugs. I occasionally hung out with my other friends, but didn't let the two groups interfere with each other. I also, didn't discuss my activities with my friends either. I eventually dropped my non-partying friends. This was in the '70's. Unfortunately I became drug addicted and it took years for me to get my **** together. I often wonder if maybe one of my close non partying friends would have remained close, if I would have passed through the drugs as a phase. Most of my partying friend were all about the buzz. If you really care about your friend, be a friend, don't judge and get mad, because she isn't telling you everything, let her know you care and that you miss hanging with her.|`|9EV86TLvaa	Bring it up. Just start talking about something random, you know how it is one conversation leads to another. Make one of them conversations drugs and if she is doing drugs she will look away and start acting strange. Defencive.  Then ask her and support her. Get her help by telling someone but don't go mental with her that won't help any one. Trust me it will work. I hope my advise was good.|`|SxqYguUCaa	You're mad because she didn't tell you herself? So what if she tells you? Huh? Problem solved? The issue here is what she's doing. It may not seem like the right thing to do, but you need to talk to an adult- teacher, parent, whatever. Someone with authority needs to know what's going on. If you keep quiet, something bad may happen.|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Trust me she is probably going through something. so if you do talk to her, don't attack her about it. ask her to talk but do it by your self. and be supportive|`|USci6lNhaa	Just confront her about it straight up, in her face. She'll thank you later for it.|`|vkuyvIjOaa	you should get her help. tell a teacher or her mom or even you're mom.|`|C0RXM3kHaa	Tell the teacher la you!<br>  I mean, U should inform the teachr~ <br>  Never think that U can do it by yr own|`|rZnDcHM8aa	pretend u a druggy to say man i need to go get a joint etc
vt8dJNhdaa	Don't be afraid of losing her . If she really likes you then she will stay with you and not with the other guy just because he says he likes her . If she decides to go to the other guy then she might not be right for you. Maybe she just wants you to say that your lucky to have her or to take her out to a fancy restraint . The little things count to girls compliment her on her jewelry or her cloths and Always say she looks pretty . Maybe you should talk to her and work things out because you need to know whats wrong if you want to fix it . Good luck (:|`|02YeluJzaa	Oh...I knw how you feel mate...Well cant do anything if your girl wants to she will.....|`|9e0a1e86de9f931c4d935186db1ac8d9aa	Sweetie it seems that you already lost her, to be honest i think that she has just been looking for an excusse to leave you. I dont think you will last that long if she does not change, if you really want to be with her tell her the truth that what she is doing is hurting the relationship and if she does not change then you should move on.<br>  Good luck|`|ezzSeBnLaa	It sounds like you don't really have a choice. If she wants to be with someone else, then there's nothing you can really do except wish her the best and move on. Wouldn't you rather her be happy with someone else than unhappy with you?|`|cb8730kNaa	dont worry u have very good attitude|`|FygMdfN6aa	aww, i was in exactly the same situation except i was in your girlfriends roll i wasnt trying to fall out with my boyfriend though, anyway my boyfriend spoke to me about it and told me how he felt and how he was scared of losing me, i realised i love him sooo much and said to the other guy nothing is ever going to happen between us and asked him not to talk to me untill his feelings subside, if the other guy is a good gut he will understand and not talk to your gf if thats what she wants. if he kicks up a fuss hes not worth being her friend, you do need to have that chat with her though, like if shes falling for this other guy more than you its not worth being with her, it could be a hard convo but needs to be done, you cant be treated like rubbish untill she finds out what she wants.
yBTTPsbNaa	Ask your neighbor if you could use their driveway. Or ask your sisters friends if you could move their cars down the street so you could play than go get their cars when they are ready to leave. If your friend lives close by you could always go to his house. This can be done just until the construction is done.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	What's wrong with them parking in the garage while your parents are at work. Would that free up the driveway.
IfV5b3lIaa	Hun, if a little peach fuzz bothers this guy, he is not worth it and you could do so much better. Don't change a thing about yourself for anyone!|`|kSIbucMjaa	DONT SHAVE IT<br>  <br>  lol coz then it will come back twice as thick and black lol<br>  <br>  so dont get rid of it, and im sure the guy wont even notice.<br>  <br>  dont be paranoid and if that guy doesnt want to be with you just because of that then hes not worth being with full stop.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|zQSnNBj1aa	if it is stubble yes you can|`|QPVEL0NLaa	Not really but I have a suggestion. I wouldn't be waxing that mustache into a handle-bar style if I were you.|`|MZBP1Souaa	As long as it's soft it won't be a big deal, Blondie.  Ask him if he finds Tom Selleck attractive before you smooch though.|`|jx2Kbgqlaa	If it is not visible then no guy will be able to feel it.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Only if its a handle bar moustache honey!|`|mFGw6zoCaa	i think if he has stubble himself then he probs cant feel any hair on ur face lol|`|nNExPtAtaa	i doesnt really matter.youre blond so it doesnt show.and the guy who kisses you/loves you will love you for you.he wont judje you by your looks(or if you have a moustache or not!)<br>  <br>  g'luck.|`|No4p9AYjaa	you us cant feel it <br>  don't shave or wax it as it will be stubby and you will be able to feel that|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Try running the back of your hand lightly through it, to see if you feel anything.  That should give you an idea.|`|faf627e55a95a22d42d6bbdbbb2c5170aa	Yes, of course he'll feel it.   But he's undoubtedly noticed it anyway, even though it's blonde.|`|yfYOScbqaa	Women do not have moustaches.  Absurd.|`|lFenXNCzaa	No and nor do guys care|`|ejuJiZAAaa	shave|`|StqBr5XRaa	that should not matter my friend, we all have hair in places we don't want it so give that person respect

uuPJ9xmNaa	How much does the moon weight in chocolate?<br>  How many times can you fold a piece of paper in half? (there is an actual answer to this)<br>  How many teeth do dogs have?<br>  Do fish have ears?<br>  What kind of cereal does the president eat?<br>  How many times a day do you blink?<br>  How many letters does this sentence have?|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Ask him how big his wang is.|`|AA10373677	ask him how many girls he had sex with or if he would do a 3sum
8XKmMBU7aa	There isn't any friend in whole the world.<br>  Try to be friend of God or your/self.<br>  <br>  Truth is bitter than a lie.<br>  Any one can add me in his/her contacts, So you may remained in my touch.|`|RVy0yKgHaa	This is just like this fight/hatred thing with my friends (lets call them 1 2 3 and 4.) 1 and 2 were best friends and 3 and 4 were best friends. They all hung out until 1 and 2 started changing, being friends with totally random people, and just not paying attention to 3 and 4. They got in this HUGE fight, and 3 and 4 found new friends. After a little bit, 1 started missing 3 and 4, and then she told me (I wasn't getting involved) that she wanted to be friends with them but couldn't because of what happened. <br>  <br>  Overall to make a long story short: Don't go back to being best friends right away. Be more like acquaintances, someone you would say hi to if you ran into them somewhere, then your friendship will grow up from there. If your friends don't seem to take you back, maybe there not worth it.|`|u7MJk5pEaa	this sounds exactly like a situation i had.  what you should do, is send them an email.  saying, we used to be best friends, and everything that happened is just kinda stupid.  i'm not saying we have to be best friends again, but we definitely shouldn't hate each other and throw away everything that we once had.<br>  it really helped with my friend and i.  and over time, you'll start to become friends again.  it worked for me, i hope it will work for you :]]|`|h8EJxnpdaa	Move on <br>  or<br>  Be really close wiv ppl they hate|`|4na8FsaEaa	just move on. if they did that to you then ask yourself if they are really friends?
6d24f693dd6b18591adc3d8b452d8540aa	How old are you if you don't mind?<br>  1.You should hang out with/talk to your cousin more, after all you guys are family. It could also help you with the whole making friends process.<br>  2. Being shy never gets you anywhere, so let loose, have fun & speak up, if not you'll miss out on a lot, there's nothing to be afraid of.<br>  3.Tell your aunt to grow up, she's an adult and she shouldn't treat you like that. Maybe you should say something to your parents or even grandparents about the way she treats you.<br>  4.Rumors are rumors, although sometimes they have some truth to them, but if not, just deny it.<br>  5."Cool people are not always popular, and popular people aren't always really cool.." You're your own person, you can hang out with who ever you like.|`|JF0SIngqaa	I was shy in school also. Now I can talk to anyone . You have to look at it this way. If you become become comfortable with yourself you will be comfortable with others. We are all the same and no one is better than another. don't look at your cousin as popular look at him as your family. Don't listen to rumors. Don't believe nothing you hear and only half of what you see.|`|SxqYguUCaa	How about talking to your cousin? He's family after all. Just because he's more popular doesn't mean you should shun him. My cousin was WAYYYY more popular than me but that never became an issue with us. Try some communication. I can totally see where shyness can seem like bitchyness- happens very often.|`|lsndG34Aaa	To talk your cousin about something like school, film or ask him some advice !<br>  <br>  " Tu tu roi khoai se nhu ! "|`|rPoKRm8gaa	whattttttt?|`|vjBLkWaPaa	well in my opinion its better if your not popular but....<br>  <br>  if he says your stuck up, he probably says that because he thinks you should talk to him and hang round all the time with him just cause everyone else does. and you should think hes great and everything.<br>  <br>  on the other hand though, he might be like that and say your stuck up because hes jelous? and no i'm joking around, maybe he doesnt like being popular and doesnt like it because you have the peace and quiet and you dont have all the added problems that come with loads of people hanging around you<br>  <br>  how you can solve it??? talk to him about it, say "what makes you think i'm stuck up?, and are we always going to be like this around each other,? why cant we just be friends, we're both different i dont have a problem, with you being popular if you dont have a problem with me being shy and quiet" dont be scared to say how you feel<br>  <br>  the rumour problem?? find out who started this rumour and find out why, you can sort it out from there.<br>  <br>  oh also, try and make some friends! there will be a person just like you that will be feeling the same way as you and is a shy and quiet person, dont be scared to talk to people, you'll be ok!<br>  <br>  i hope i helped <br>  email me if you need any more help, dont be afraid to ask me<br>  good luck<br>  xx|`|ReCy0Omxaa	Um...I never heard of a story like this. I think maybe you're looking at it the wrong way. My friends thought this one clique was soo popular, but than I got to know them and they all acted like little babies and were very insecure.
7MDwQ669aa	True love...it's something you feel. <br>  <br>  I have constant butterflies. I look at him and can't help but smile. I'd do anything for him. I love him unconditionally. I know no one I'd perfect, but to me, he is perfect. He makes my days better. <br>  <br>  He moved from Arizona to Missouri to be with me. <br>  <br>  To me, what we have is true love.|`|JszhMKw9aa	I say he does love you more than his girlfriend but  he doesn't want to just walk out on her. If you really have feelings for this guy always stay supportive and always be with him and wait. I'm sure you'll figure this all out. ^_^ its good that you would give your life for him it shows him you care for him a lot.|`|JDmDQJ9Waa	If you're really in love than youll always get the butterflys when he walks your way. when you walk next to him you'll feel like you're on top of the world and nothing/no one can take you down.|`|I63igrrOaa	love.<br>  <br>  ?<br>  answer mine plz:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au1oyqjS5qjmzOhl6RWptqMazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227130938AAy6oUA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6tHA0QQXaa	you feel that the person is for you,and only you,but be careful not to mistake it for infatuation :-)|`|saJoelMwaa	Yea, sounds like it.<br>  But its a feeling.<br>  Your no if u r or not.
GPZuYCyCaa	I think he could have a crush on you, or think of you as a very special friend. Btw .. love your sense of humour! :)|`|ecmnS63Uaa	what gave you the first idea........yes he does.|`|4uOWeRbtaa	Wuvy duby woooo why don't you get his phone number and call him at home wWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lol they used to do that when i was in elementary lol in side the gym a boy would be talking to a girl and the coach would say real loud to the whole gym why dont you get his phone number and call him at home and all the kids would go WOOOOOOOOOO lol|`|a59vFP3laa	YEAH!!!!!!!1|`|tnfJ5kMkaa	..try out as good or best of friends first before going on to the next level..|`|ep5oRNBCaa	ya...think so|`|mqpg0dR0aa	No.|`|Kdbpr2yOaa	Yes he does x|`|lsndG34Aaa	you are only a friend with him but  more special
fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	Why don't you ask them why they're opposed to it?  Don't argue or defend your position---just ask them to tell you what their problem is with the DVD.  They may be mistaken about what's on it, in which case, you can allay their fears with more information.  On the other hand, they may be growing concerned about the content of some of the DVD's they've been seeing, so they're starting to draw the line.  At any rate, it's only a DVD, and they are responsible for you at this point, so be prepared to take "no" for an answer.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	ask them why they are against it, they might have a good reason. If not why can't you just go into HMV or somewhere and buy it yourself?<br>  if not then there's not really a lot you can do|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Whining, begging, and pleading does not show any maturity to your parents and usually makes them more set against giving you what you say you want.  You want this DVD today, tomorrow you want a new CD.  Why should they give in to everything you want?<br>  <br>  First off, you need to know why they object to you getting the DVD.  Then see if you can address those concerns.<br>  <br>  Remember, they have the right to just say no because they want to.  As frustrating as that might be, they are your parents and sometimes they just want you to accept the fact that you were told no.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SxqYguUCaa	Why not buy it in the store? Unless it's a rare DVD.<br>  <br>  Well, all you can do is talk to them for now. If that doesn't work, try to get one of your friends parents to buy it for you. Or you can wait until you are 16 and get a job and buy a prepaid VISA card and order it yourself(that's what I did!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, parents rule here and there's not much you can do when you are young. I would know >:[
8XKmMBU7aa	You bas tard, the dust of the stool.<br>  may god, you die and your fiancee will have same situation in her parents house or same may happened with her family members.<br>  You may sell your sister. <br>  I have two extra portions, She may live there freely.<br>  <br>  Truth is bitter than a lie.<br>  Any one can add me in his/her contacts, So you may remained in my touch.|`|be52fc0d175d76bbbfd17b8117a2d632aa	Just tell her she cant stay. Its your house. Or if she does stay you will have to lay down the law and kick her out if the rules get broken.|`|B24W8w43aa	Write a list of house rules and pin it on the fridge and give them some chores to do to keep them quiet/earn their keep..If you just stand back without saying anything they will abuse your hospitality so you must make it crystal clear what kind of behaviour is expected in the home.|`|AA11064923	I have a feeling if you let your sister stay, you will never get rid off her. There will be no incentive for her to get out the situation she is in. You need to put your family first and explain this to her. If you sisters boys are as bad as you say they are, then i would not let them stay. I found the thing about them holding your daughters nose when she cried most disturbing. you will be constantly watching them and you cant be there 24/7.|`|AA11857809	Maybe that's why she's disowned her parents....because they said no.<br>  Perhaps they realize she needs to help herself and know that she is responsible for herself and her children.  Saying no sometimes hurts, but it can also turn out to be a good move in the long run. But don't let anyone put you on a guilt trip. What's most important here is what you and your fiancee want for yourselves and your family.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	You  may not want to hear this, but she's your family and you need to be there for her. I agree with the rules thing that the first answerer put. Explain to her as politely as possible that having her stay really does put a strain on your family life, and beg her to keep her children under control. If it gets out of hand tell her that she really can't stay any longer if she's going to be so disruptive, but think about it, if it was the other way round, you'd want her to let you stay with her. Good luck!|`|XUOMwpQ1aa	Just tell her to clean up and keep her kids under control. It may be hard, but its the least she could do.|`|9298mlxoaa	If I were you I wouldn't invite them to your house unless the children are trained to behave themselves.
SLbWcrZjaa	That's a hard one without knowing what the dad is like. I would say he needs to give himself and his dad some time to adjust to the new life that his dad seems to want. Tell him sometimes even parents make mistakes, we are human too. The dad might feel guilty right now, and that is why he is acting that way. Give it some time. Tell your friend, that I'm sure that his dad does love him, but sometimes problems with the other parent makes them take it out on the ones they love the most. Tell him to pray for his dad, and let God take care of it.|`|mbprjCSiaa	he should not go and see his dad! not at all after what he did especially if his dad ran off w/ another person he should spen time with his mom it sounds like she would need the most help. good luck|`|AxWWiyZaaa	boyfriend or best friend lol ? <br>  anyways.. well, its kinda up to him...<br>  my parents split up when i was little and i DO remember it.<br>  It was pretty horrid but my dad didnt run off with someone else nor my mum..<br>  I dont really know ! its confusing. Let him make up his mind, give him your opinion . <br>  ? hope this helps
jD1xacNbaa	Go over to his house in the morning and talk to him<br>  If your too shy, than just bring a cake or cookies to give him, and than start talking!<br>  Hope I helped dear.|`|1xM9TV3Jaa	We are now not in an era where men take the first move.<br>  <br>  Instead, you take the initiative and talk to him.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	say "hey i noticed you noticing me lets ****"
rJOuo24saa	ARE YOU ON DRUGS NO WOMAN WILL RESPECT YOU FOR BEATING THEM MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD BEAT YOU|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Not only are you a wimp, you're an idiot.|`|M63kq3AYaa	Sure, that'll work if you want a puppet, but you'd be doing yourself a favour and staying out of jail if you just got a blow up doll, both a blow up doll and a woman that sticks around for beatings do the same job, except cooking.|`|94nYpq6Taa	I think you should concentrate on your own life before you try to start another relationship cause if that's your attitude then you'll be a lonely person for a long time to come, abusing women is not acceptable, if that's what you think we like then you can think again, i've been in bad relationships and now i have a guy who treats me how i deserve and i wouldn't change it for the world, get a grip, you sound desperate if you think that's how you keep a woman, clearly you've just not met the right one.|`|fPN2KV1Taa	Not all the girls are like that. If ever I was treated the way you treat your girls, I would fall even MORE IN LOVE. You might think jerks always win, but in the end, they end up being the ones hurt even more. Remember, bad guys never win. The girls you dated might be different, but as a girl, I know most of us prefer nice guys. :D|`|UWj7XorXaa	just be normal you dont have to treat girls like queens nor do you have to beat them just be there when thy need you     <3<br>  abuse is gay|`|NddCvrTMaa	Probably only Rihhana could allow you to be a dog.. No other gal would.. Why not try making the move and ask her out before other guys do..?
WytfaeWeaa	i have like an identical thing going on in my life right now , except ive lost every single on of my 8 best friends i have cried allot but you just have to accept your not going to get them back.  have new friends but they just don't compare to the ones i have lost. i think you should try and get them back even if your" friend" says they don't want to. if they don't accept your sorry then maybe there not very good Friends to have anyway.<br>  hope that helped x|`|SxqYguUCaa	Just forget them. Who needs drama starting b****** in their life?|`|823Z8NH3aa	It sounds as if some apologies need to be made. Even if you don't think it's your fault, I'm sure they'll listen to you. They me even think they're wrong, but are just to proud to admit it!
q8m8wSTYaa	She's probably embarrassed and thinks you'll think differently of her or won't want to be her friend.<br>  Dry bringing the situation up but say something like, I know you haven't told me but someone else did and Iwanna help you through it, or something like that. I'm sure you can think of something.|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	Hmm. Maybe she is afraid of how you're going to react. Like maybe she thinks you will be let down cuz you know she had other plans for her life. Or perhaps she is scared you will tell her parents. I would just tell her what you heard from the other friend and ask why she hasn't told you. After that all you can do is be there for her.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	she doesn't trust you i don't think so but may be she is embarrassed to tell you this thing but you have to face her but don't be harsh with her and try to stand with her because she really needs you|`|69660f8cb6408b3f65f3fbe18f701800aa	Because you are her BEST friend, she cares 100% more about what you think of her ans she probably doesn't want you to be disappointed in her.  Whereas with the other friend, she doesn't really care what she thinks about her but still has someone to talk to about it...<br>  <br>  Just go to her and tell her you are her best friend, you love her and won't judge her is she has something to tell you .<br>  <br>  Good luck -x-|`|a3bq277Gaa	Maybe she's embarassed and thought you'd judge her or something. You are her best friend after all, she cares alot what you think about her.|`|GpqzuhpCaa	Your friend doesn't want to tell you and told this other person because she is afraid that you will judge her. Just let her tell you when she is ready because other wise this could damage your friend ship.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =)|`|YfYjVPudaa	She's probably worried about your reaction and needed to tell someone who didn't know her really well .Don't take it personally she'll probably tell you soon|`|wLFM00iiaa	she may be afraid that you will kind of ditch her - if she isnt married then she might think you will not accept her and if she is then she may just think that you will not want to be her friend because you will have to deal with her getting bigger and then all her pregnancy symptoms<br>  the other reason is just that she isnt pregnant <br>  or she didnt want to tell anyone close to her but she needed to get it out to someone <br>  she may be having an abortion <br>  she may not trust you with the matter|`|AA11813527	Maybe she is waiting for The right time. (Her right time). And she is not lying to your face just because she has not told you. She could have her own reasons. If you know and the other friend did not say it was a secret ask her about it. Sometimes it is harder to tell your best friend things especially if they are this big. Just relax it will all work out.<br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  <br>  Kali :-)|`|1xM9TV3Jaa	As you being her best friend, if she was to tell you then you would be her by her side at all times. But if she was to tell a friend that she's not close to, she would have some space and get the news out of her too.|`|rBMkiK9Kaa	Maybe because she wanted to leave it as a surprise for you. Or maybe you did something to her or made her angry or something and you didn't realize. Maybe she doesn't trust you anymore. You should talk to her about it and ask her what's going on.<br>  Good luck !<br>  =] xx.|`|4uOWeRbtaa	Tell her straight up I know your pregnant why won't you tell me|`|AA12077420	she doesn't want to hurt you.|`|OhUMyfTUaa	this was like my problem but about a different thing.<br>  i suggest that both of you talk. tell her that you already know about it. she is just afraid that you would see her differently and that you won't accept her if you knew about it. <br>  <br>  when me and my friend fought and this secret thing came up she told me that she was just afraid that i'd see her differently. i told her that she had been my friend for a long time and what happened to her won't change our friendship. after this she said sorry and now we are friends again.|`|rozWodFYaa	Maybe she doesn't consider herself to be as close to you as you feel you are to her. You shouldn't take it personally, or mention it to her at all! Just chill out. If she wanted you to know she'd have told you. If she doesn't, it's her secret, not yours!|`|HF5Ra7q8aa	sometimes it can be a hard thing to tell people but age is really a factor. How old is she? If it's really getting to u that much sit down and talk about it with her. Let her know u felt betrayed.
zmWotb1taa	ohh well<br>  tell her that it was a big miss happen|`|np2kU9ixaa	I love you already? Your not even going out with him and your only twelve. Just say its for my bff friend.
0eFcXyZ6aa	I think it's because they can train them sexually, older guys are set in their ways mostly.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Because they look better than men, and because they cook and clean up after themselves, and like being told what to do. <br>  <br>  And then there's their stamina, haha ..... >;-)))|`|AA11447210	Plenty of us don't. Those that do perhaps want the ego boost of playing with some young dude, or maybe they think they're "training" him. <br>  <br>  Why do some young guys like older women? I'm 44 and get hit on by guys 18 through mid 20s here and there. NOTHING appealing about that to me.<br>  <br>  I don't know what older women see in young guys. I'd much rather be with someone closer to my own age, experience, and maturity level than someone young enough to be my kid. Not gonna be much in common there...|`|eac75caab6258ca8fcef0dc7cb34f6acaa	My experience as an older lady is that younger men hit on me. This I understand as there are many reasons for having a sexual experience with a more mature woman. <br>  <br>  More often than not the older woman is not going to try and take over your life, she has already had children and does not feel the need to 'trap' a husband/boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Experience - an older woman knows alot about sex and is often more uninhibited<br>  Excitement - the challenge of scoring with a different type of sexual partner<br>  Fantasy  - really needs no explanation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As to why older woman would hit on a younger guy, well there are a couple of reasons I can think of:<br>  <br>  Challenge - to see if she still 'has it' eg attractiveness, skill etc.<br>  Stamina - younger guys often have more staying power and an older lady is just as, if not more passionate than her younger counterparts.<br>  Fantasy - again doesn't really need an explanation.<br>  <br>  There's probably as many reason as there are people<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|FQFuQehQaa	cos older men are way more boring and tired. also younger guys are still more explorative and excited about women so they are more entertaining basically.<br>  <br>  my turn!: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlCrgX_wmBW8aMFaJ9KOLJTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307032703AA1wRKH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kN00x0Vaaa	I know I know! I think it's based on two things, longevity and enthusiasm. <br>  <br>  Younger men are still in their prime sexually and in life. Old women find men their age can't keep up and still give them the attention they need.<br>  <br>  My husband loves cougars :)|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Because they think a younger guy is sexually fitter than an older one!|`|Jg6VnhFlaa	Sometime she faced lot of difficulties in her past life. She lost more years (Over 20 – 30 Years) in her married life for Her Old husband and Children. She has no enjoyment in her past life therefore she searching a young man for her arm.<br>  She feels more compatible in bed with younger man. Most women said with her younger soul, I return to my 20. <br>  When a younger man married an older woman, he support to her always. She also helped to him.|`|p1mSR5Awaa	cause they are reminded that age doesnt matter as long as a younger man is or shows some sort of attraction toward them. young guys are the symbol of "sex" a woman never wants to feel as if their sex life has vanished, and a youth brings that back to them.|`|1WSFNX35aa	Hmm.. no strings attached maybe?<br>  Also the fact that men are at their sexual peak around age 19 while women tend to be at their peak around age 30.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	I'm not sure why maybe the same reason men like younger women or maybe it's because of the youth that gets them flirting.|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	I do not know... good question ha, preferably I like older guys.|`|Ax6Cg9chaa	yes older woman is cool but some times.

If he did it once he will do it again.|`|Oyvlt2vyaa	I'd speak to him, and get his side of the story and then (no matter what he says) speak to the other girl too.  Put together both stories, seeing which one is more plausible, if certain facts add up and most importantly, who you trust.  If you don't trust your boyfriend, then it's as good as over, speaking from experience.  It doesn't matter if he did cheat or didn't cheat when you don't trust him, as trust is the basic founding blocks of a relationship.  Wish you all the luck with whatever you decide to do. :) Keep smiling. xx|`|TWNh6Dooaa	Dear oh dear.<br>  <br>  He did it again honey because you gave him the green light to do it again.<br>  <br>  There is no point asking what we would do NOW - when you FIRST found out he was a cheat, you should have ended it there and then, but you took him back - so he did it again. <br>  <br>  He thinks he has your permission.|`|07xi6IOSaa	I would probably leave him alone. I can't trust him, and without trust.....we have NOTHING. We can't be happy, can't be together, nothing works without trust. Period.|`|prTLJnXFaa	p*ss on his face while he's asleep
G4HVf7f3aa	Girls and guys both have those urges. Girls seem to be able to keep it more under control and don't show it as often. Guys on the other hand aren't as afraid in general to jump the gun.<br>  <br>  But no, girls and guys aren't really all that different.|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	no one knows. we cant be both a man and a women in this lifetime
r8WlqZFXaa	He sounds immature to me. You deserve better, if he has already admitted to liking someone else then hes not ready to be in a committed relationship. I suggest you do something about him and talk to him before you get hurt even more x|`|TXlosr92aa	Yes, if a guy likes another girl, that is the beginning of emotionally cheating.  Why keep him around? But before you end it, ask him about it. Say you understand and don't want to end on bad terms if he does like this other girl.
fuia2Z6Maa	somebody is me and hero from enrique. and you're beautiful from james blunt
Bv1srSo4aa	Yes, me.  We stayed together until he died a year ago.  It takes one day at a time, hard work, and wanting your marriage to work. An finally one day you find Love again.  We were married for 30 years and I love him with all my heart and soul|`|MkKvGdxKaa	Yes, but im not going to lie, it was over two years of hell. Me checking his phone, always checking where he was, being a total control freak in other words. him becoming agitated and upset, feeling constantly punished and guilty. When he's say to cut the strings, id say, 'do you blame me? we wroked it out eventually but Id NEVER do it again. I wasnt pleasant at all.<br>  this was 10 years ago and we're divorcing now for other reasons, many complications,  but, it was always there, somewhere in the background.<br>  <br>  Edit: Re your add-on. Honey it is possible. Have you thought about or talked about marriage guidance? It would be a good place to talk about why it happened, how you both feel, and what boundries need set, as the answerer below rightly said, and where you both go from here to put things right. when done in this setting it might help any resentment both ways. There is a reason why he cheated and that might boil to the service when he is asked to make provisions while the trust is being re-built which could cause needless arguments. i really wish your family well, and hope it all works out for the 5 of you. If you both want it enough you can get through this. just as long as it's done right.xox|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I wouldn't want to do that. I wouldn't take the risk of them doing it again (most do, even if it's way down the track) nor would the relationship ever be the same after they had done something so disrespectful and shown they didn't love you. Good luck anyway<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|OHfZFR31aa	I have two friends who took their husband back, went to counselling, etc to try to work it out. And guess what - in both cases the husbands ended up cheating again, and now both are going through divorce proceedings.|`|aWEybdDFaa	Through better or for worst in sickness & in health until death do you apart DOESN'T MEAN TO COMMIT ADULTERY!  Adultery is something all judges are against even GOD.  So, why shouldn't you be against it?<br>  <br>  This wasn't what you were looking for, but I needed to say this:<br>  Why should you fix something someone else destroyed? It's hard enough finding the one to marry. I am married and love my husband to death this is the soul reason I would never be with another man. If he can't do the same than that shows he doesn't love me the same way.<br>  It's obvious your husband is selfish, couldn't come to you about the problems he felt, no, instead he made a bigger problem by cheating. You CAN'T forget what he did, the marriage would never be the same, so why involve your children on this road of destruction. How can you act normal or even feel happy, knowing your SELFISH HUSBAND cheated.  You'd never trust him again. Don't live in misery because you swear it's the best choice for the kids. There are great men that would love your kids the same way and will appreciate you as their wife or woman. Give yourself that much.|`|BWM7NIA0aa	From the male perspective, My ex cheated on me not once but twice.  The first time we worked through the problems and insecurities of trust and rebuilding our relationship. You tend to be suspicious of their every move, why they are late from work, etc.  In the end, she met someone else and played the game again.  I was no angel in all this yet I didn't deserve that treatment from her. My daughters took it very hard when I filed for divorce from their mom.  This pain they have gone through will likely be there for many years.  This was 8 years ago, and we get along well (although I barely tolerate new husband of my ex).  Sometimes you have to let go to move forward.  I hope that you can work out your differences and be happy once more.  Good luck to you and your family.|`|qGiFTnC2aa	My husband cheated on me early in our relationship. He was sorry, I forgave him after a couple of years. We've been married 13 years, we're very happy, the sex is great, we have two kids. It can be done if you are sure he knows it was a mistake and it won't happen again. If you completely lose the trust then you may never be able to rebuild.|`|oHmVGBCEaa	yes trust me it can be done but before you can move on you have to have truly forgiven.we are not married but have been together a long time either way it's still devastating it happened 10yrs ago and we are reasonably happy just have the normal ups and downs like anyone i don't know how long it took me to trust him again now when i look back i just know it happened for awhile after though i did set boundaries such as he wasn't allowed to go drinking alone for awhile as this was how he'd met her and to top it off i knew her i knew i had to ease off though at some point else there was no going forward and 13yrs later it's worked <br>  you know your husband better than anyone if both parties are willing to work it out it can be done it's hard work but worth it if the relationship is worth saving but don't do it for the kids do it because you and you husband still love each other if this is not the case you will both end up making the kids miserable anyway. good luck

I mean, if he is lying to you, and then flirt with you later, its not worth. There will be others. It is harder to get over him when you are in love with him but seeing as you just "like" him "that" way, let it go. Sometimes, guys can also be a little mysterious. The best way to know is to talk to him because if you don't tell him how you feel, it is not going to happen. You can't sit down and wait for him to ask you out or whatever because its no use.|`|BXXQubTRaa	from a guys point of view, it just seems like hes trying to be a player. He has a girl that he obviously cares about or else he wouldnt be with her, but then he also has you to flirt with when things get boring with his girl.

But i think it is best for you to wait for him to break up with her, if he doesn't that means he doesn't like you. I know this is hard for my personal experience i can't stop thinking of that guy. If he doesn't break up with her then you should move on just like he did.|`|AA10064196	He's using you as a "filler". He only likes you when he's alone.

But I would talk to your dad about it first. Is he okay with the extra responsibility of taking on another person plus the baby-to-be? Make sure he is okay with it, and if he is, then sit down and plan out things.

Good for you for sticking by your friend!|`|OLHNleEaaa	I am not sure how old you are or how old your friend is, but there are places you can find for her to go since she is with child.

I ended up going to a home for unwed mothers because as your friend my parents were not pleased to see me pregnant with out being married.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, you should ask your dad definitely on what it is his decision, since he is the owner of house he should be aware of your doings and decisions you want to make.|`|nGVoyPoEaa	you are such a good friend. you should let her move in until she can get on her feet because she has no where to go and she could end up in a shelter and that wouldn't be good.|`|K5uoaetaaa	Discuss it with your dad before you do anything else.

Consider the fact, this will affect your dad, his money situation, his sleep, his patience, and his concern about her influence on you. <br>  As a good friend, you should look into what sort of support you can get her. Can she move out and get government support, what sort of support groups can she join, financial support, emotional support. You cant give her that. You can be her BFF. but you cant be her hero.

byNiRl0Xaa	just ask them when it feels right to/for you =)|`|pU97DEjNaa	Tips: <br>     1. So, you decided to ask this girl out, but you are not sure how to go about doing that. There is so much conflicting and confusing advice out there on asking women out on a date, that it's hard to figure out which advice is most useful in your specific situation. Indeed, it is important to ask the girl out the right way and avoid the typical mistakes that so many guys make when they ask girls out.<br>     2. Here is a list of points that you should keep in mind to make sure that you ask the girl out the right and the attractive way:<br>     3. Don't ask but invite. Don't start your conversation with "Would you like to go out with me?" Instead, invite and start the conversation with: "Lets take a walk together at this new park."<br>     4. Don't use the word "date." As ironic as it sounds, you are better off not using the word "date" when you are asking a girl out on your first date. Instead, simply invite her to spend time with you. "Lets go on a date" take all the romance and all the tension out of the situation and will likely turn the time you spend together into a very "non-date" like experience. If she asks if it's going to be a date, this is a perfect opportunity for you to be funny and say playfully something like: "Of course not; it's purely business."<br>     5. Be specific about time and place. Don't say "lets do..... sometime." Name the day and approximate time of when you want to meet. Also, don't use vague, weak words, such as "let's hang out" as this implies some kind of passive attitude and purposelessness to your time together.<br>     6. Don't make a big deal out of asking her out. Don't make it sound like asking her out is a matter of life and death. If you are tense and nervous when asking her out, she will feel just as tense and nervous. Make your invitation sound as if it was the most natural thing for you to do (and it should), and this will help her feel comfortable and at ease with the plan as well.<br>     7. Don't plan anything too exciting or complicated. The purpose of the first date is to spend time together and focus on each other rather than some very interesting activity such as a concert, sports game, etc. So keep that first date simple where you have the opportunity to talk to each other and get to know each other without too many distractions.<br>     8. Keep the above five tips for asking a woman out on a first date in mind, and they will likely serve you well.<br>     9. <a href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.practicalhappiness.com</a><br>  Good luck :)|`|cQ7mKIP5aa	I heard on one of the talk shows recently from a relationship expert, that first you ask them, "Are you seeing anyone?"  If they say, "No," you ask them, "Would like to go to Starbucks for coffee?"  Once at Starbucks you kind of interview them over coffee to see if you have similar interests.  After coffee you say, "Goodbye, it was fun."  Dont kiss yet.  Call back in a two or three days if you're interested, it they act interested and receptive interview them some more over the phone to see if you two click before making a second date.  If they act disinterested at any point, move on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a><br>  Enter Marneen Fields<br>  in the Search Box,<br>  and Click GO!|`|P0JNLIpRaa	no, there is not a 'method'. it isn't a science experiement :)<br>  <br>  there are no wrong ways to ask her out, but there are some that are slightly better than others<br>  <br>  don't do it in front of everyone,<br>  start off with asking how she is,<br>  her friends have probably told her everything already, so just ask her if she wants to catch a movie on the weekend or something. she will probably be expecting it!<br>  <br>  best wishes, and i hope it works out for you
RCJqaWQYaa	Heyy, here are some different types of kissing; <br>  <br>  The Platonic Peck<br>  <br>  Turn your head before you lean in. If you want to kiss someone on the cheek, and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in. <br>  <br>  Pucker your lips more tightly than you would for a romantic kiss. To know if you're puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible "pop" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed. <br>  <br>  Keep it brief. The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step - nothing more. If your lips linger, it won't seem so platonic. In some settings, it might be appropriate to not make any lip to skin contact at all; read up on How to Air Kiss. <br>  <br>  The French Kiss<br>  <br>  As you are locking and re-locking lips, brush your tongue against your partner's lips ever so slightly. This should make it clear that you want to French kiss. If your partner's tongue does not respond in like fashion or if they pull away, you will have to save the French kiss for another time when you are both ready. <br>  <br>  Slowly open your mouth a little bit more and gently push your tongue a little farther into their mouth until the tip of your tongue meets the tip of theirs. Let your tongues brush against each other briefly and gently and then pull it away, back into your own mouth. <br>  <br>  Close your mouth a little (not all the way) and open it again to start another kiss. This time you can push your tongue a little further into your partner's mouth, so that more of it brushes against theirs. <br>   <br>  For a passionate kiss: Put your hand(s) on your partner's face, neck, or hair and hold them close as your tongues meet. Gently suck or nibble on their lips here and there. Breathe deeply. Kiss the person like you just can't get enough of them, and like you might never get to kiss them again. <br>  Finish off a French kiss with a little lip locking (as described in the previous section) or continue kissing, in which case you'll want to read the tips in How to Make Out. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Visit the website.. <br>  Good luck :]|`|6JPiNGdfaa	100|`|s5F745gBaa	You got the Peck; A just a light kiss on the check or lips.<br>  French kiss; You've seen them in movies.<br>  Romantic; Like a French kiss, except you move your lips around a bit.<br>  Smooch; Need I say more?<br>  Make out; Need I sya more?<br>  <br>  I think that's it.|`|oYQazAFkaa	enter a nickname.......wow, i can't better that answer!...<br>  <br>  i've actually been pulling some real weird faces while reading your advice...trying out your moves with no partner lol.....|`|Xl4o7tRqaa	kissing is kissing lol<br>  you do it how you want to|`|dvevk1qbaa	What types of kissing ARE there?|`|FBSOBz0zaa	Idk xD|`|eAx9wk1zaa	kiss of death

jBigEy0Caa	The heels are a bit too much and I would tell him there is no way.  Over time they can do damage to you and they are very uncomfortable to wear all the time.  There are many women who are uncomfortable in sleeveless tops, and you should not be forced to wear anything that makes you feel self conscious.  I feel like you need to sit him down and tell him how you really feel.  He obviously thinks you are very sexy and just wants to see more of your body, but you need to let him know how you feel.  If he does not love you enough to back off, then maybe he is not the one for you.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Uhm, no one can force you to wear anything.  Wear what you like and are comfortable in.  You're not his little doll to dress.<br>  <br>  6 inch heels is rediculous, it's like he wants you to look like a hooker or something.  If it were me, i'd think twice about marrying a controling jerk like him.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	I think you should "force" one of your new 6" heels into his scrotum and see if he likes it? Be your own person. Don't let anyone force you to do anything you do not want to. If he doesn't understand, move on without him. Its only going to get worse.|`|09k5GLLkaa	First off why are you giving in to his demands and wearing what he wants you to wear? Be yourself and not a puppet. Do and wear as you please. Sounds like you don't really care that he is a control freak and telling you what to wear and what not to wear. You both need some marital advise and help. What you wear is not something that should matter to your husband. So there is no need to suggest what to wear since it will have to be ok'd through your husband first.|`|OeLmW4Leaa	he cant force you to wear something, find something you are going to be comfortable in and compromise with him! if you wear something that makes you uncomfortable, and you're not familiar with- you're not going to be comfortable with yourself.|`|dSeKZlsQaa	Ask in Yahoo Indian then!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Where does your boyfriend live?  Where do his parents live?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't change my manner of dress for a boyfriend.  6" heels are terrible for your feet and his mother cannot surely be impressed by these? lol  I would wear something as a compromise.  Not the sari, not the sleeveless.  Something in between.  [I say this because it seems to me he is not reconciled to cultural differences, so if you want him, meet him halfway]<br>  <br>  I don't like this "forcing" business.  Don't stay with someone who forces you to do anything.|`|1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	You should wear what you are most comfortable in. <br>  <br>  You can compromise to meet him half way but make sure it is always what you will be comfortable in.<br>  <br>  Also  be appropriate and modest.<br>  <br>  <br>  What do you mean you are too dark?  (get real)<br>  <br>  Most importantly read the hand writing on the wall if he is "FORCING" you now what will he do when you are married.<br>  <br>  If you give him control now he will have it forever.<br>  <br>  Never start something you can not finish.
PTovC2Dqaa	Well coming from a guy myself, don't try to be too direct with things. Don't just go up to the guy and say, "Hey you want to go out some time?'' because that will just freak him out a little, especially if you don't know him that much. But if you slowly try to become friends with him, he'll get to know you a little more and he will later figure out if he likes you or not. Usually if you're with him a lot, there's a better chance he'll have a crush on you and if you're with him even more, then that tiny little crush will start to grow.<br>  <br>  With boys who have friends who are girls, he'll think in his mind, "Do I like her or not? I don't know...". So you just want to let him know that he does secretly have a crush on you. If he starts messing around with you and trying to get you mad and annoyed, then he likes you a little.<br>  <br>  Usually boys are the ones who have to ask out the girl, not the other way around. But that's not true. He wants the girl to ask him out so he can actually know if she does like him. Believe me, when a guy gets asked out by a girl he has had a small crush on for a while, he'll be excited and thrilled to death.<br>  <br>  Ask him out when he's not around with his other friends. Remember, you have to be his friend also and be with him a lot. When he's alone with practically no one around, that is when you finally ask him out. Now, a guy does't care how a girl asks him. He'll just be glad he got asked out in the first place.<br>  <br>  By the time you know it, you would have gone from liking him and him not knowing you, to you becoming friends with him, to you being with him a lot (still as just friends), to you finally asking him out.|`|N2e248rTaa	do you mean that you want him to ask you out?? or him to ask out his twin for you?? :S sorry i would answer but im a bit confused :/|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Di you go to the high school to chase hot boy or your education.  Be very careful before if you force yourself on him, you will be the one to regret at last.  There so many people fall over to date you.  Who will really love you.

vn2Lq7hIaa	The sadist part of this whole ordeal is the loss of Fred, and I sympathize with you, but you have to realize she probably would have those same feelings if you had him. And unfortunately Fred can't talk, or he would choose one of you.<br>  <br>  If you are trying 100%  to be mature, You are only 10% effective. Lavishing yourself in self pity will only prolong the harsh feelings you are experiencing. You will have to face reality and the cold hard facts, before you can begin to reestablish yourself. <br>  <br>  Why are you asking for emails from prospective wives when you're just recently split and proclaim love for your ex wife .Your aspirations of finding a a special lady who will be nice to you for once pretty well sums up the kind of husband you were, and you would make. My advice is get a new dog, and be happy with that relationship, forget about women, it's never going to work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i know how you feel.. as it has been on my mind to.. about this ... best thing to do . is nothing ..until your mind is made up .mate .. but first thing is go out .. and look at a dog .. then think about it for a day or two.. then get a new woman .. just to be with you .. and please get a lawyer.. as she has the dog ..just to upset you .. she dose not want the dog .. but she know it hurts you so she want it ...get it now ..i do.. by the way .. dont work so hard next time ..|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Sounds like not only you WANT your dog back...you also WANT your bi+ch back.<br>  <br>  Forget about her.  MOVE ON...go to nudie bars.|`|AA11496842	You wanted a child and you got one. Your wife is proof of that....|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Sounds to me like she did you a favor. In time you'll probably think the same way. My ex left me for our next door neighbor. A young lady. How is this old man going to compete with that? Still after I got over the initial hurt I started dating again. Probably dated a hundred different women. Had some fun and then met my current wife. Life is better than it ever was before. Oh yeah, I was 48 when she divorced me. You sir are still a kid in that regard. Have fun. Don't get a dog until you've settled down though. He/she will only get in the way while you're dating.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	Oh wow..I am so sorry ...some people can be really mean...I hope you find someone great soon ...and I am sorry she took your puppy...man what a piece of work she is, I think you are better off without her...but don't be so eager to look for someone new, try to heal all the way first..and forget whatever she says about you or your relationship..some people have no class and it shows...anyway, I am sorry she hurt you|`|x3LclBZ0aa	its never easy when someone you care about leaves you for another person. especially if you know deep down inside that you were good to her. im sorry youre going thru something traumatic. seems like things like this happen to good people. im sorry, but know that you shouldnt blame yourself for what you did or did not do. you played your part and it was her own doings that made her leave. try not to blame yourself about this. its her loss and sooner or later you will find that special woman who will reciprocate the love that you so freely give. but i think for right now, its best that you take some time to "heal" and recover before you make another big leap into that dating scene. however, it might be fun for you to start hanging out with friends and meeting new people.<br>  lotsa luck!|`|NGKwsawdaa	First go get your dog back...then move on and start enjoying life again as being single. Don't go out there looking for a replacement wife because you only make it worse. You will find someone out there that will appreciate everything that you have to offer them.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I think I answered your other question you posted. Get another dog. It will help. You'll have a buddy to spend time with and show affection. It's not your old dog, but you can integrate him into helping you make your house a home again! :)|`|CQsD09D6aa	It is normal to be hurt after a break up. Remember that this too shall pass.

Go out with friends, join a gym, take up a hobby and yes... get a new dog.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	how many times are you going to post. <br>  <br>  it hurts. it will hurt for some time. but ranting about her wont make you feel better. start living your life. start being social. <br>  <br>  and...GET A DIVORCE.|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	Two Things:<br>  <br>  1) Stop sad-sacking it. No woman wants to hear this sad moppy story. Women are insecure as is, the last thing they need is a man who emotes that trait. FYI - Show her your not just going to be a good guy push over and take her to court over the dog. Show some balls on this one if you really want that dog. (Also shows that your 80% good guy, 20% alpha male)<br>  <br>  2) You didn't loss your wife, she left. Let her go. No point wondering, feel happy it happened now and not 10 years from now when you have accumulated more wealth. Hell there are people on here whose wives past away, now that is something to take some self reflection time to.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Good guys get walked over by women alot and with the way your talking you sound like an easy mark. Fix who you are, grow some confidence and get back out there. If you can't do that, then you might as well call Mom and let her know your moving back in the basement.|`|AA10911598	You are going to need to stand up tall and be adult about this.  Your wife was wrong to betray you this way.  You should have the dog back.  Ask her to return that ASAP.  She may not.  You are going to need a lawyer and one can help you get what is rightfully yours.  This is a mess it sounds like.  You wife will one day be treated poorly and she will then realize she left a good man.  My new husband had some of the same things happen to him a few years ago.  He worked several jobs to come home one day and see his wife was screwing his best friends brother.  I know the dog showed you the affection and the love you had to settle for while your wife was away cheating on you.  I would call for an appointment soon and first ask for the pooch to be brought back and then get the divorce papers printed and give what she deserves.  Do you have pictures of her and her cheating with the new younger man?  Print copies and use them against her.    I wish you the best.  I would be heartbroken if my animals were taken away so my heart goes out to you.  Things will get better.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well the best thing for you to do is to SERVE her with DIVORCE papers do not let her control your life like this... Take back your power and prove her wrong <br>  get another dog if that is what you choose but don't get a dog because you want something to love you get a dog because you want something to love the animal will need you just as much as you need it <br>  ps. aren't you glad you didn't bring a child into this mess|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	hang in there......no one leaves this world without paying for all the harm they've caused so just like she left you for him, he'll leave her for someone five or ten years younger, its only a matter of time,,,,,go out and distract yourself, have some fun and start dating again|`|iTVoXWjxaa	my advice is, send her flowers, start trying to date her all over again.  She's in a phase right now, that guy will leave her soon, trust me.  Just try to make her feel more guilty (by being nice) and she will come back to you. Send her flowers when shes at home, send her chocolates, send her gifts.  She'll come around.   Good luck.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	From reading your posting -- i am not sure you want your wife back or your dog back.  <br>  <br>  Anyways -- whose dog was it belong to?  Was it your dog or your wife's dog?  I suggest you should just go get a new dog.|`|1B91qtNQaa	Wow that really sucks! I would suggest some kind of counseling for yourself. My mom saw someone just a few times after my dad left her for a woman 10 years younger.<br>  <br>  I think it is admirable that you are trying to be mature especially when everything inside you is probably wanting to beat the crap out of the other guy and go steal the dog back. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|1epjqrflaa	Im sorry this happened to you, the world is unfair and people can be cruel. That bitc* will get what she deserves one day, you wait. The dude she is with will probably end up cheating on her. You will find love again, your still young. My advice, start having some drinks ( since you dont drink) and go meet some new people. Getting a dog  from a shelter who needs love is a great idea, you can help each other.|`|IpWTMetHaa	Dear Jimmy:<br>  <br>  Put me on your contact list, and you will, I am certain, have a field-day, reading about my mother' infidelity and what it has done to my family.

Took your dog and is posting pictures.<br>  <br>  Cripes...take a little time to heal.  I know you don't want another dog but that's a fact you have to face..she's got the other dog.

I got in a lot of trouble,almost like he trouble you are going to be in if something is not done and done fast. Go to your principle's office and request to see a school counselor at once! You are in an emergency situation and you have to act immediately. You may need to see a doctor who can help you. <br>   Legal advice. If you do what i suggested above and get letters stating what may be going on with your mental health,and you get expelled? Go straight to your state's school board(not your local one),and explain to them what happened,show them as much information as you can,and if you are expelled,they can reverse the expulsion.<br>  Walter C.|`|Kw3dO045aa	See about being test for the gifted class.

I then filled the cylinder with glass marbles and had a candle sitting on top of the marbles.  When my husband and I arrived at the reception, the cylinder was at the head table.  I lit the candle and said a prayer.  Any one who came up the the table saw it and read it.

You and your fiance should honor your fathers quietly and privately, in a way that makes you feel they are there in spirit.  For example, maybe your fiance could wear a watch or cufflinks that belonged to his father, and you could carry a picture of your dad in a locket around your neck.|`|5veU5nSwaa	Set up a table at the reception (and even at the ceremony at the alter if you want) with a photo of each of them or a collage of photos on a poster board with a heading that says something like...In remembrance or Wishing you were here or Gone but not forgotten, something along those lines.

za9b8cHKaa	You'll never convince her that her behaviour is wrong. She is either suffering from a mental illness, or is just an extremely selfish person. What you and your siblings need is help. Your mother needs to be reported to social services - this can be done by telling a teacher at school what is going on. By law, they then have to report it to the proper authorities. Then social services can step in and get you all away from her.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Your stepfather seems like a nice man.<br>  <br>  I think the time has come to stop merely telling someone off, I think your stepfather should divorce your mother, kick her out and change the locks.

I love the ting tings my friend hates them she likes the saturdays but i don't, do you think we could care less? It is just an opinion thing and if the girl gets worse she is not worth it because she won't let you express your opinion!<br>  <br>  2nd why do you call people stalkers? If she won't stop saying how gay they are then don't listen, just say I like them and I don't think they are gay so leave it at that and forget about it!<br>  <br>  hope this helped. Oh ya and i think the jonas brothers are really bad and all there songs are computerised! I don't think anyone is gay unless they announce it!

Nobody has any idea of what to do during a kiss the first time, so don't worry about that either. Just go along and you'll soon get good at it.|`|P0JNLIpRaa	well, i am not going to tell you to practice on your hand or a spoon or something, because we all know that you can not simulate that kind of connection and ahhh, i dont know how to describe it! but you cant practice for it lol...<br>  <br>  ok, a few tips and thoughts<br>  <br>  unless the guy is a total jerk, he obviously likes you and wishes to make you feel comfortable with yourself (as you attempt to do in any bf gf relationship... i hope lol) so he isnt going to dump you if you 'do it wrong'. in other words, you dont need to be self concious around this guy if he is interested in you, and you like him too...<br>  <br>  when you are hugging him, just look up at him (make sure your lips are a little wet) and gently touch yours to his. I guarantee that he will have been waiting for that moment forever, and will kiss you back. it comes naturally, so don't worry! just open and close your mouth a little! that's basically it!<br>  <br>  but make sure you do something with your hands. seeing as you are probably quite young and i hope you dont plan to go very far physically with eachother, run your hand through his hair and across his back. lower back especially<br>  <br>  After a while, if you want to make out with him, just kiss him like you usually would. then slip your tongue just inbetween his lips. if he reacts positively, go a little farther and push it in just a little more. alternate pressure and kinda explore his mouth (sounds bad, i know... but it is the best way to put it lol!) keep going (but not to the point where you gag him,.. but that isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be. so dw bout that)<br>  <br>  it comes naturally though, so discard the advice in this massive message and just go with the flow<br>  <br>  you cant stuff it up... it is ok :)<br>  and if you think you have just smile, say "ooops" and give him a quick peck on the lips. laugh it off. if you are laughing at it... he will too!<br>  <br>  Best wishes and happy smooching!|`|be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Honey,<br>            There is no one in the world to teach how to kiss??? <br>  Kiss is a sign of showing love and affection on a person.

MkKvGdxKaa	What country are you in?<br>  <br>  I answered your last question I think? From the things he has said to you while you are with him, these issues will aplify when you leave him. i know, it happened to me. And with his controlling nature he will be likely to still try to control everything even when you arent together. i know from experience. He's saying now that you are freeloading? imagine what he'll say when you are apart. If you are serious, you need a lawer from the very beginning. What he needs to pay to continue supporting his family will have to come from a lawyer probably. My ex took the family business and only paid me a scrap of maintenance leaving the kids and i on benefits. We got evicted from our property and my ex said it was my fault. I wanted custody of the kids so i could support them. Im now left with a lot of debt going through the divorce courst which he is responsible for anyway, so it was just silly. I had a 9yr old and two under two. He told me to get a job and support myself. He is also emotional abusive and continues to be even now. They dont like it when they lose control. i warn you, he is likely to step it up. But, no matter what he is saying to you, they are his problems, you are not freeloading, you are raising the family you made together and the roles you have chosen leaves him still responsible for maintaining the family lifestyle while divorce is taking place. If you can't take his abuse anylonger and it's truely as bad as this the just get out. Be pre-planned, well organised and then ask him to leave the home. You don't and shouldnt have to go anywhere. Dont let him manipulate you. Is that what he's doing over the sleeping in thing? Making you feel you are also in the wrong for his anger? As i said before, he does deserve a lie-in, but you don't deserve the abuse. It worries me that you seem pretty isolated. you will need people around you to help keep you sane and viewing things clearly if he is a manipulator. Good luck with everything. Just be prepared. Dont give him any leverage at all.<br>  <br>  Edit: Your son is still very young and moving school would be acceptable at this point in my view. He'll settle in somewhere else just fine. Kids are much more adaptable than we give them credit for i think. As long as he thinks it's an adventure, an adventure it will be.|`|QK1jfKG9aa	My mom left us when i was 3, there was 5 of us, we hardly see her because she got married, but everything turned out well nevertheless, we grew up and were mature enough to understand, in your case you will prob remain where your son is, whether he remains with you or your husband, make it work for him and dont stay with your husband if you know leaving him will make you happier. You can work things out and work hard to not let it affect your son, im sure.|`|ccmax0yQaa	take ur son along with u....bt first u need to earn|`|U1wAKo1Gaa	Oh, I'm soooo sorry, and you are so right....it "is" easy to say "just leave him".  When my husband moved out, I had a kindergardener and was a stay-at-home mom also, however, I was lucky enough to have family right next door.  Well, actually, I wouldn't say I was lucky because I got spoiled....taken care of throughout my childhood by my parents, then right to my husband where I was spoiled once again and taken care of completely, then to my family once again taking complete care of me as an adult, and now with my new husband....and guess what???  Yep...spoiled and complete care!!!  It's really sad, huh?  Now I'm not saying I'm lazy, my house is always immaculate and my children the same, but spoiled nonetheless.  I add that I also have two college degrees, but what good are they sitting on a shelf???  The point I'm trying to make is, though it sounds like I've "got it made" I most definitely do not....no income, no retirement, relying on someone else for each and every need I've got, being labelled a "trophy wife", and being ridiculed for all of it.  I could never make it on my own if I wanted to.<br>         My advice to you and please take it to heart, is to carefully, silently, and especially without anyone else knowing your agenda, plan your "way out of the marriage".  You need to save some money, remove any and all debt from your name, thoroughly document any and all abuse at the hand of your husband on a daily basis as well as any abuse your child is exposed to or a victim of - you will need it for divorce and alimony, go back to school - have your peice of %^^% husband pay for it - learn a trade - find something that makes you happy and will make you enough money to survive on your own if need be, and knowing that you are probably very lonely and searching for love and acceptance, if you happen to get involved with another man during this time....be very, very discreet in your endeavors with him.  Now, I'm not saying that this is "morally and ethically" right, but it is what is best for you and your son; and frankly, who cares about a man's feelings who has abused you for so long, right?  <br>         Just don't end up like me....I have it all!!!  Yeah right....anything and everything I could ever want except my self-esteem and self-respect!!!  What you see isn't always what you get and what may appear perfect on the outside may be flawed to the core on the inside.<br>         I wish you lots of luck and hope that you will someday find a man who will treat you and your son as you deserve to be treated....like you are the only two people on the face of the earth deserving the uttermost love, respect, and decency!!!  Good Luck Ladybug.........I'll be praying for you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think where there is a will there is a way.  When a woman is ready to leave, she finds a way, especially if the issue is her safety or that of her child.<br>  <br>  I think that this can be done in stages.  If the situation is mentally abusive, you start by creating a safe place within your home where you can get away by yourself with your children, if necessary.  <br>  <br>  You start putting away bits of money.  Cut corners on family spending so you can.  Start cutting coupons for groceries, anything.  Look for ways to stash some money.<br>  <br>  Beg from family.  Borrow from family.  Run to family.

People, get real and leave the world out of your marriages.<br>  <br>  My opinion as a 42 year old woman is that sex for women begins in the mind.  This is her way of being in the mood when you get home, because apparently, you have communicated to her that you want to find her that way or she perceives that you do.  <br>  <br>  It is not the same as when men masturbate in lieu of sex with their wives.

Once you get into marriage masterbation really should stop, and start giving into eachother when the other is in need.<br>  <br>  Sex brings you closer together, masterbation brings in fantasies about people outside your marriage, it creates distance.  Talk to her, tell her you want to satisfy her but you can't because she's already finished herself off before you can even get home.  <br>  <br>  What about you?  You need satisfaction too.  Having to resort to your hand because she is already done isn't fair to you.  She needs to learn some self control, and some patience until you get home.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Honestly, if my husband ever catches me, I hope he joins in. She probably times it roughly so that you DO come home in the middle of it. I've always liked being sneaky about it - it feels very risque! So.. just try joining in and see how it goes? What is she going to do? Stop completely and ask you what the heck you're doing when she was doing it first? ;)|`|W7uP1ty4aa	Scold her?!

A little rubbing and wanking never hurt anyone (unless you are doing it wrong)|`|J2xkPdlcaa	thats just bad. if you are upset with your b.f because things didn't go your way. kissing a guy won't help you solve the problems. i think the problems are not being solve am i right and both of you end up fighting and so to make your problems worse you kiss a guy that is not your b.f. that is not ok. it doesn't make you bad. it just make you feel bad because of what you did.  i suggest that you solve the problems first and not to do this again.|`|ThbicuDlaa	Woah. You should NOT have kissed that other dude. And i dont think your boyfriend will appreciate you talking to other guys on the phone like that. But it doesnt necassirily mean you're a bad girlfriend. If you really want it to work with your boyfriend - be open and honest and stop all the crap with other guys. By the way - you dont have to kiss a guy if he comes to your house. <br>  Good Luck :) x|`|hOGckhAuaa	the only way to stop urself from doing anything like this again in future is to admit it to them both & deal with the repocussions, it'll make u feel alot better knowing you did atleast one good thing.

QPVEL0NLaa	not if you put a condom over the phone|`|N2e248rTaa	urm..?|`|za9b8cHKaa	Afraid so!|`|PYZ3APQDaa	Yes you could. if that girls parents pick up the phone and hears a grown man telling her 13 year old daughter how he wants to stick his tongue or dong some where they could freak out call the police, trace your number and tell them they heard you threaten to do things to their daughter. That is a drastic example but that is just not worth it!|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	lol phone sex<br>  but yeah ud probly get in trouble
za9b8cHKaa	Yes. That seems wrong to me. I think its best if opposite sex siblings have different bedrooms - girls in one room, boys in the other. Your sons are probably not keen on the idea of sharing a room with a seven year old girl anyway.<br>  <br>  Talk to your ex and his girlfriend and explain that you are concerned. If she will not listen, tell her that you think it is not appropriate for your sons to stay there, given the circumstances.|`|jQz5vABzaa	Yes be concerned!<br>  A boy from 13 and a girl 10 and up should not be sharing rooms.. Its healthier to adopt separate rooms!<br>  <br>  Out of my personal experience I am telling you when it starts to feel weird or corny!|`|Q2o0fpdMaa	It's illegal to let children of opposite sexes to share a bedroom / bed when they are 10 and up so put the girls in one room and the boys in another<br>  <br>  tell your x's girlfriend about this and I'm sure she'll make an exception<br>  <br>  good luck ;)

The worst possible thing she could do is offend someone.

Only a handful of people have seen me angry.

For the exact reason the other person said.  It takes a lot to get me there, and once I'm there, I know a couple of things, almost without fail: I have a damn good reason for being there, and I have probably already taken too much.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, you're right, but this is NOT an excuse for bad behavior!  "Well I was mad, so that's why I....." does not cut it in my house.  Just because you're mad doesn't excuse bad behavor.  You don't HAVE to give in to your feelings.  <br>  <br>  My words get extremely pointed and sharp,  but never below the belt (name calling, attacking, insulting,) basically at that point I lose my filter and unrestrained truth comes forth (even more than normal!)    This means I may overstate something in a moment of anger, but that's usually the extent of it. <br>  <br>  I CANNOT sustain negative emotions either, so I get over things quickly.

aWEybdDFaa	Times like these are difficult to overcome but you can overcome them. I'm truly sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  You could never find your husband in anyone else. If you financially need help, go back to school and take up something new. Or get a second job. You could also look into getting a license to be a child care provider(since you're good with kids and have extra space in your home) Age shouldn't matter, time will heal all. Give yourself TIME to find YOURSELF. Don't depend on anyone's help because 10 years from now they can die as well. Than what, at 69 you'lll be looking for a new man.<br>  Start doing things out of the home, you had a lay back life but life should be fun and interesting for you. It's time to make a big change in your life, and start looking for self improvements.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	I am truly sorry for your loss. <br>  <br>  I understand how starting again can be hugely intimidating but I think you're looking at it from the wrong angle. You're not starting again, you're continuing on. <br>  Obviously it's going to take time for the loss of your husband to heal. I mean, it will always hurt a little but we survive and one day you'll be able to think of him with a smile, which is how it is supposed to be. <br>  For the moment you need to take things slowly, grieve, give yourself time to adjust, spend time with family and friends and take comfort in the time you had with your husband. <br>  If you're feeling lost and lonely you should try looking into some clubs and things. Find something you enjoy doing and do some reasearch to find like minded people. I'm not sure if you'd be comfortable doing so but a lot of communities have programs to help older people deal with the death of a spouse or partner and gives you tools that will help you take the first steps toward moving on. <br>  I think the hardest thing about losing a spouse is getting to know yourself again without them. You work together for so long as a team that when one of you aren't there anymore you feel lost and off balance. The thing is to try to balance yourself out. Spend time focusing on yourself and what brings you comfort and give it some time. If you spend your time doing that and making some new friends who understand and can share your experience soon you'll start to feel balanced and the memory of your husband will be one of the things that you can draw on for support and comfort. The life experiences you shared will give you strength and the friendship that existed between you will provide you solace when times get tough. <br>  You're not starting again, you are continuing on and even though your husband has departed the life you shared, the love, the laughter and the family you created is still with you, it's a part of you and it has made you who you are, you just need a little time to figure out who that person is. It is normal to feel lost, lonely and like half of you is missing but the important thing to remember is that even though your husband is gone, what you shared with him remains as real today as it was when he was still with you. You are still you, the same person your husband loved. You just need to take a little time and see in yourself all the wonderful things i'm sure he saw in you. Then you'll be able to take the life you shared with him and forge it into a new life for yourself. A life in which your husband is cherished and remembered but a life that ultimately belongs to you. <br>  The departed never leave us, they remain in the experiences we shared with them, memories we made and the hearts that loved. They become a part of us, giving us depth, strength and joy when we need it most.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	I am so sorry for your loss i won't pretend to know what your going through because no one can not unless you go through it yourself.

rIOD8tgvaa	You have a lot of responsibilities and it is a stressful time in our world.  I think this is more about you wanting a change in your life and having to deal with the stress.  You need counseling.  Do not give up your relationship with your wife.  You will come out of this with help and the family and love you have at home will become more valued and real.  Sometimes we do think life will be better with change. Change is good but, this change is suicide and self destructive.

One is ,you used the word boys and two is being drunk. This makes for a very unsure and insecure future. Obviously you are single and young and there is no way you should be feeling guilty because of a boy. I believe it's your own conscious that is trying to tell you to straighten your life out now before you end up in a very bad place. It's time to be in charge of you,  no boys and no booze, very bad combination. Take some time and get to know who you are, what you want out of life and then begin to put something into this to insure you have a bright and wonderful future for yourself, first and foremost. All the best and good mental health|`|YBIiEF3Paa	dont repeat,|`|f742491fb09b86c6462592b9c9819414aa	The honesty within you is the reason you feel deeply down - were you not a person of that nature you wouldn't be suffering the traumatic aftermath. It is an 'error' that many of us can fall into - the fact that YOU recognize that with shame is more than ready for much needed self-cure.<br>  <br>  Because you are carrying such a hefty load, resolution is required - perhaps that may be achieved by you gently revealing that to your partner OR a trustworthy friend. That honesty of yours needs to be acknowledged by whomever - hopefully allowing you to stride forward!|`|7541af920534320050bed438788e7151aa	Selina please dont worry is he is a man of enough understanding he will forgive you after asking for forgiveness.<br>  <br>  These things do happen and people do forgive.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	tell him the truth. the truth will set you free.

t2R3mEMoaa	First of all, if you are being grounded alot of the time then your maturity level is not where it should be. Best you start dealing with your own issues before you bring someone else into your problems. Mature individuals don't sneak boys over to their house while the parents are out. You are asking to get grounded for yet another scheme your plotting. Your relationship with this boy is as it should be, in school only and should not be taking your mind away from what should be your primary goal, education. Try spending a little more time with you and what you want your future to look like. If it's all wrapped up in boys, then one day you are going to wake up and wonder what happened to your own life. It's your choice of course, but this time make the mature one.
iNziGCQzaa	First of all. How can she be 6 months younger than you if she is 19 and your are 18?<br>  <br>  Anyways that's beside the point. You shouldn't lose confidence just because her boyfriend is more handsome. I know it's hard to believe that she would ever choose you over her guy because yes looks do matter. But you can only be yourself. You can't control who you fall in love with so it's not your fault. But it would be your fault if you ever tried to FORCE her to fall in love with you. You just can't. In such a situation you can only continue to be friends with her and let time do all the work. Keep being close to her and let you know that you are interested and treat her with respect and care. HOPEFULLY one day she will come to realize that she has romantically feelings for you.<br>  <br>  So, just keep your head up, be thankful that you are alive and well and have a dream girl in your life that provides fuel for your everyday activities. Be glad that such a girl is in your life right now and just cherish the time you spend together. <br>  <br>  Fate will do the rest.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	You will consider this a strange answer perhaps.  You need to become more confident.  Not much more, I might add but, a little tweaking will help your situation.  I want you to volunteer.  Help the needy.

AA11620807	sweetie, I'm not saying this to be mean but if he cheated once, he's doing it again. The pro's all agree that if the cheater is honest in their sorrow, they go to WHATEVER lengths they have to, in order to prove they're faithful again.  <br>  <br>       I know how your hurtin hun. My ex coaxed me into believing in love after a different heartbreak. Then she proceeded to f*u*c*k 2 other "fiancees" and 3 coworkers. I saw photos. I forgave her with the stipulation she come to ME this time...... She never did. excuses to keep me from moving on while she screwed every guy that was willing.  No misery match here, I'm just showing that I know what I'm talking about.  I kept trying, and only developed an honest hatred for her, and women in general. Thats where you'll end up if you stay with him.|`|ZnTfnuN8aa	Sounds like you need to stop making the running and let him contact you at least you will know if he cares or if its time to move on.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	PEOPLE........I have stated this on here numerous times, so pay attention. If your man is cheating, when he comes home, wait till he falls asleep or fake that you are "interested", and take the opportunity to sniff his junk. You will know instantly if Mr. Happy was somewhere he wasn't supposed to be. If he has facial hair, use the same tactic. Thank you|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	talk to him and tell him how you feels. in a relationship both need to communicate so the relationship could work. use it. if you think there is no use talking to him anymore or he won't listens to you or you wholehearted believe he won't change at all, then it's time to leave him and move on.|`|pjQuFJo2aa	call cheaters the tv show on g4. that will help your problem and to show the world not to date this person who could be cheating on you.

Don't use a female and male condom, they will both tear, just some sound advice from Sue the talk sex lady from Canada.<br>  <br>  It is smart to discuss past sexual behavior of his since this is your first.  Make sure he has had an HIV test, that way you always have a peace of mind if the condom happens to break.<br>  <br>  Be communicative, and don't ever feel you can't ask someone if they are safe! It is your body for the rest of your life, they may only be temporary.|`|inzOTV1Raa	If you dont want to get on pills & pregnant then condoms are perfect. Go for it!
ejuJiZAAaa	english english english|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|nNExPtAtaa	i think you should just wait until you meet him.if love blossoms,then you'll know.if not,forget him.<br>  <br>  good luck :)

tlIlmTs2aa	By listening to your friends' conversations, knowing their likes and dislikes, what their tastes and preferences are, building-up a picture of the things they may like to receive in the form of a gift.   <br>  <br>  Over the years, I have subconsciously gathered a lot of information about my friends.  One friend whom I have had for a number of years does not like items that are fussy and so has a preference for very plain and ordinary items.   She loves handbags but dislikes those with buckles or are bulky and so she is given very plain ones which she happens to love.<br>  <br>  It was the same with my late mother - she was very conservative in her tastes and so it was, she loved to receive presents that reflected her life-style and the person she was.  Christmas cards had to be ones that eptimise Christmas eg Madonna and Child but not christmas trees or snowmen which she found insensitive.   The same was with Mother's Day cards - she always told me I took a lot of time and care over my choices both with the picture and the words whereas my sister gave her ones she had given little thought to and so it lead to disappointment.<br>  <br>  When people ask me what I want for birthday or Christmas, I now tell them.  In the past I have been given things that are not what I would buy anyway and so it is, they are given to charity.   It really is really thinking about what your friends would truly like to receive rather than guessing and hoping you have got it right.<br>  <br>  So I would suggest you listen to your friends to what it is they are actually saying and not what you believe they are saying or guessing what they may like to receive.  It really is a matter of considering their responses instead of guessing they may like the gift.<br>  <br>  These are only my thoughts but the fact you have asked for others to put forward their ideas, means you clearly are a good and loving friend and it is to be hoped they cherish this friendship.   It is a credit to you too that you are thinking about what your friends may like to receive.<br>  <br>  Good luck
IPS3hWweaa	To me it seems to rise whenever its a large group of women spending a significant amount of time together.

There has to be a reason, but make sure you are ready for the answer before you ask.|`|ccmax0yQaa	get married ASAP|`|AA11913674	he got bored leave him|`|htWw0OlCaa	If you are having to practically beg him for affection, then it might be time to move on.|`|AA11705300	Two kids and he's still a fiance, not a husband? Something is holding this guy back! He's trying (he can handle that for a day at a time) but he may think this is not what he wants and he's obligated to stay - so his compromise is to stay but be unhappy and distant. Couples counseling may help but you have to be willing to accept the outcome.
tObI0whAaa	leave him - the best thing a parent of a teen can do is support but from a distance - let them know they can come to you but dont force anything on them. then its just a matter of trusting them - this is the biggie.|`|5GslKD4baa	What's wrong with masturbating..?|`|4O1wAwayaa	He's normal and healthy. Why bother him?
hokWD3Jjaa	I say just do the chores regularly without her having to tell you that way you are showing responsibility so then she knows she won't have to take away privledges to get you to do them thus both of you being happy.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	You do not explain the reason she took it in the first place.<br>  Often when we want to present an argument in our favor we leave out our part in the beginning of the disagreement.<br>  I bet the first time she asked you to do a chore she did not take your laptop; or even the first twenty times she asked you to do something for her.  All the things she has done for you since you were born and she has to take away a favorite toy to even get you to get off your lazy butt and give her a break.  Think about your part and then you may have answered your own question.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Well, has she ever asked you to do your chores, come back a bit later and find you on the lap top and not even started on the chores? I have with my son. :-(  Moms feel helpless sometimes and resort to that type of punishment..which I admit Ive done before. (I know, bad mommy) but all I want is for the help to be done. If you know your chores, just do them without her asking and I KNOW you'll both feel better and you'll probably get more freedom and less hassles. Just try it for a week and see what happens. Good luck hun|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	Instead of doing a bad job, do a great job,  Did it ever occur to you that she knows you are not doing as well as you could, and "she" may resent that.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Have you told her how you feel? I would do that. If she expects you to act like you can do chores she does need to treat you like you can. I can see taking it away if you don't do them but not taking it away before she gives you a chance to do them.
i6Mi8uWIaa	Your boyfriend sounds like my husband.<br>  <br>  Things do change when you go from being just friends to being in a relationship. Neither romance nor just goofing off is more important. What's needed is actually a healthy balance of both. <br>  <br>  Pick a fun movie to watch together, preferably a silly comedy that you both enjoy, pop some popcorn, and have fun just riffing on the movie, ala MST3K. <br>  <br>  Or you might go fishing or bowling together, or whatever he's into that he thinks is fun. <br>  <br>  The point is, find a balance between romance and fun that you can both live with.|`|ZteoS74raa	My husband, Steve, and I were best friends.  Believe me don't think this thing to serisously.  Time goes by much too quickly.  I say have as much fun as possible, the romance will take care of itself, you'll see.  By the way, I lost my husband after only 5 and half years of being together.  So I say cherish every moment.|`|InHiJXeaaa	i think hes got a point but if ur close and more romantic isnt that a good thing, if he loved u like more than frends then he wouldnt be complainin, i think he jus wants to be good frends :( xo|`|8CTosi9saa	Here's my 2cents, he misses goofing off with you, just chill and have fun with him have a Little fun|`|DRSv6SOLaa	"Trust".  :)
4I2iOOqIaa	no, it is a good thing, because you could go back to sleep with her and get warm and sleepy together.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	A bad thing?  How do you get 'bad' from that? She may not be fully awake and aware of what she is doing.  Or, she may want to see, without asking, if you are interested...|`|qQq23yziaa	Its kind of cute THE FIRST TIME. after that not sure how cute it would be|`|H7hHCHRkaa	I also do this but only because my hubby get's upset with me and then often gives me a spanking!!!! LOL|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Well, next time, ask what it's too early for and wiggle your eyebrows. It's never too early - for anything.<br>  <br>  If she's anything like me, she might have been hoping that you'd initiate some early morning lovin'! :) You know.. since you're both awake and all that.. ;)|`|vfJPCGcmaa	Not really.  It's more cute than anything.  Did you really have to ask this?<br>  <br>  Maybe she meant it was too early for a morning "quickie" and wanted a couple more hours of sleep before "makin' bacon"...|`|wseP86qSaa	Seriously? Maybe you should ask her to refrain from verbalizing her inquiry and then put the clock on her side of the bed. She needs to respect your sleep needs|`|FFsoiWe5aa	Buy your wife a F**king alarm clock, and when she still doesn't use it tell her to shut up and go make some breakfast.|`|W7uP1ty4aa	This is a horrible, horrible thing.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	No, that's a good thing.  Better than a snooze alarm. =)|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If I was married, I'd probably try that to get some early morning sex.  If I was you, I would've gone for some early morning sex and if she wasn't trying to get that, it would have served her right for waking you up.  lol
QFf9phAmaa	he must attend definitely the party for his son.without any fail it is compulsory|`|pGIOz14Faa	The primary thing in everyone's mind should be the comfort and happiness of the son.  After 15 years, surely both parties should be able to summon up a cordial attitude.  All they have to do, is greet each other, exchange a few common courtesies and then move on.  15 years should be time to put things aside, they shouldn't act 15.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	He can't ignore her because that's not fair on the child who is going to pick up on the bad vibes. I think he should be pleasant with her, that's not to say he has to be her best friend or anything but just be pleasant for the child's sake is the adult thing to do.|`|AA11315360	You should try and go if you can (and if she wont get violent with you being there). Yes he should just ignore her.|`|b87a5879411cc73399fed0fc30748c19aa	You have every right to go because your his wife|`|WxWiP3QJaa	He should always be pleasant to her for his son's sake, whether it is his son's birthday or not. If she is unpleasant to him, his son will notice - it's all about the kids.<br>  <br>  No, you don't have every right to go and if you havent been invited, don't go... it is about your "husband and his son", not "you and your husband's ex-wife"... ignore those suggesting you should go, if you haven't been invited. Only two people know truly what went on between them, and that is the husband and ex-wife... other parties may be involved but it is their issue, leave it there - with them, don't allow the ill-feeling to infect the other relationships.<br>  <br>  For those of you suggesting she should go along... think for one moment - maybe the son is asking her not to go, maybe the son - who is obviously 15yrs+ knows how his mum gets when the "new wife" turns up and doesnt want that to taint HIS day... think about HIM for one moment, rather than your stupid, selfish self. Sorry if this upsets the original asker - it is not intended to put words or thoughts or actions into your mouth!|`|InHiJXeaaa	well my mom and dad are like that they neva saw each other for 10 years and then my nan  has recently fell ill and my mom had 2 visit my nana as they were really close wen they were younger, my mom and dad argued the 1 time but then found it better just to be civil, but in ur case its only 1 day so its best jus to act normal and they shouldnt ignore each other as his son will only feel angry with him for arguin on hs birthday :) xo|`|JWV2J8Gfaa	He should attend the party with one thing in mind, that he is going there for his son. Nothing else should matter, no matter what subjects might get brought up or past memories mentioned, he can nicely respond with today is my sons birthday, everything else can wait till a more appropriate time.. then he can respond with something like "what did you have planned for his dinner? or when are we going to bring out the cake? or how has he been doing in school? This will draw any attention away from the previous subject keeping the party calm, cool, and non-awkward.<br>  <br>  And if he has to bring out the special artillery.. my favorite goes.. Is there going to be a pinata or shall I just use your head as one, not that much would fall out of it.  Hehe.. I recommend saving that till the end.. kinda like the grand finale.|`|Vc6eNci9aa	I think he should try to be nice because if he is mean he will ruin the boy's birthday. Maybe even try to talk to his ex. I've had the same awkward position. My ex-husband and I had a daughter named Alexis (Lexi). I had to go to her birthday party. I said, "Hey Lexi! I'm here! Is your dad here?" And she said, "No, daddy doesn't want to see you ever again... don't you remember?" It made me feel terrible.|`|yBBjTVQaaa	I think that it is bad that you have not been invited, after all it was 15 years ago. It shows that the wife still holds a grudge. If I were him I would try to be civil for his son's sake however it will all depend on how the ex-wife behaves...we all know how women can be.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	I've been there, done that. Go with him, you are his wife, which means part of him. Just go with smiles on your faces, be pleasant and enjoy his son. Nothing and no one else there really matters. Good luck hun|`|8n0BQkJoaa	be pleasant for his son sake, its only one day|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I don't see the reason why you shouldn't go, but other then that i wouldn't worry about it..that's the past he has clearly moved on, they  just have a kid together that's all.

We act silly together and feel like nothing else matters. Always smiling, holding hands, hugging and kissing no matter where we are. Even when we are home on a sat night cuddling , we have a great time just because we're with each other. Love is amazing!|`|iblT1HJpaa	How do they act? <br>  Usually stupid and foolhardy.|`|AtpMoCH4aa	they act and feel as if they can walk on air|`|r7u2g8roaa	I'm in love for the first time now. I've had many, many women in my life but never in love before.<br>  <br>  I'm acting a little silly, a little intoxicated, very happy, send her SMS messages all the time, buy her things everyday.......I'm in love and that's the way people act.<br>  <br>  It's great but I'll survive.|`|k4ViwHTwaa	depends on age and distance when u lay at night in bed and your mind is filled with thoughts of them to the point where your heart wants to leave your body to go be with them when life just cant suck no matter how bad it gets i dont mean ohmy tv is broke life sux i mean u sleeping in a box or bout to go to jail and u ok with this cuz u have them its deep and sincere|`|aBazvBnAaa	:P well you cant stop thinking about that person and when your not with them you cant function.. they are on your mind 24/7 <br>  <br>  and usually you act reallyy happy!|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Happy, content, giddy|`|qtOTa4iAaa	It could be different things for different people.

Same with me.<br>  We kiss a lot. Hug a lot. Smile and laugh..meet one anothers eyes (causes me to blush). Especially when he wiggles his eyebrows. <br>  I think sometimes we forget, but with me even fighting with him is kinda fun. We argue over spelling something, funny sayings, sex, etc.....<br>  It is great.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	How old are you and why are you wanting to know? lol<br>  <br>  I think I act better now that I'm older and saner.  I can look at a relationship for it's potential to add to my life and I can look at my ability to add to the life of another.  I can walk away from the chemistry and the infatuation if the really important stuff isn't there.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend this approach to all young women who will listen.

zkyFY8xYaa	Sweetheart, he's just being a jerk. Probably trying to make someone jealous. And instead of only pointing out to him that he's always "through with you" only when your angry, point it out when your on good terms! <br>  That way he might realise that your actually serious about his ridiculous mood swings and not just saying it to get back at him!!|`|5sTPhPGiaa	It's like baiting a fish; pull on the line, wait...pull on the line, wait...of course he still wants you (although since he's trying to "date" one of your friends it is likely just a booty call).|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Dear hii,<br>  <br>  Could he be just entertaining himself with your attention?  Could he be this shallow?<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|DcYD9vWRaa	sounds like dude just wants to aggrivate you, its called IMMATURE|`|fydj54JZaa	either hes playing a joke on you, hes a crazy phycopath, he has really confused feelings for you, or he loves you but really doesnt want you to know it, in which case hes doing a very poor job at it. ask him what hes doing and he'll probably come clean and give you the truth. good luck!|`|K70AncTNaa	that's messed up...<br>  1. something maybe going on at home or school and he is just acting weird.<br>  <br>  2. he wants to see you "sad" so that you will beg for him to stay.|`|okxT5KBfaa	He is being stupid and if he keeps calling you then don't take him back because he is being really stupid and he shouldn't do that to a girl. That can sometimes put a lot of pressure on girls.|`|CdZK7XjOaa	Is he bypolar lol??  I think hes just trying to mess with your mind. In that case i think you should just ignore him if hes that big of a jerk and if hes annoying.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|FFQeMfFlaa	Maybe hes playing hard to get?<br>  or, he might just be hinting you that he likes u but, then again, he dosent.. sorry hope this helps! :]|`|C8ZFPleiaa	Hmm, i thnk he is just using you as a past time. .|`|WjkiAzcDaa	Communication is this perdicameant is key. Ask him this "why do you do this to me when we were dating you treated me so well and know its like im dirt to you. I thought we could at least be friends." say those exact words bet he'll reply with something that will shock you, also you may not but from what you typed it seams as though you like him i dont know whether thats the case or not but it seems like you want him back so asses the situation properely.<br>  <br>  Hope you sort it out:)|`|qqQRhkkvaa	What a jerk<br>  <br>  He sounds like he is messing you about. <br>  I honestly can say i have never come across anything like this before. <br>  Maybe he thinks it funny, maybe he has a genuine problem.<br>  I think you need to just tell him once and for all where to stick it. <br>  Because it's not funny or entertaining for him to mess you about.<br>  <br>  You deserve respect not a guy who keeps changing his mind. <br>  Men aren't worth it if they are going to hate you one second, and love you the next.<br>  Thats why i dumped my guy, coz he kept messing me around, not as much as yours but it got very irritating. <br>  Esspecially if he is trying to go out with your mate too.<br>  <br>  Avoid him. He doesn't deserve you.|`|qxJ4KauPaa	i had this weird feeling that he actually really do like you. a lot. i think he wants your attention, he wants you to tell him that you really2 wants to be with him. maybe he feels insecure. i guess he expect you to come and beg him each time he said he wanna break up with you. but since you didn't do that, he comes back to you on his own cause he's scared of losing you. i don't know if this is true or not. just my opinion.|`|1UJ8LiyEaa	Ignore him...he doesn't know what the heck he wants and you deserve better.
dFUqPcWKaa	I feel like this when my husband's at work. It's nice, but then it isn't because I know he doesn't feel like that. Or maybe he does feel like that, and he just doesn't want me to know? Either way, make sure your wife knows this - I'm sure it would make her feel very good!|`|MjSLQlIHaa	wow thats the kind of love iam dying for! i often feel emptiness in my heart, and iam pretty convinced it's longing for love to fill it up! maybe i'll get lucky one day :(|`|qtOTa4iAaa	Real love still exists -- how wonderful.

We both used to be like that and it is like you have a limb missing and hate to be more than 2 ft away from them - not because of jealousy but you just can't bear it.  Lovely stuff.

A lovely pleasant change from the norm on here !  :)|`|b87a5879411cc73399fed0fc30748c19aa	AWWWWWWWWWW how sweet!!!!!!! make sure you let her know on a daily basis. It's love! Isnt it amazing. My fiance and I are deeply in love we can't stand being away from each other. I know how you feel...GOOD LUCK!|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Maybe you are one of the few lucky ones who is deeply and passionately in love. I'm pretty sure my husband throws darts at my picture. Lucky woman your wife.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	How sweet.       This will end someday.   You'll see!   Then you will be carrying a different picture! ;-)
fdcbdb56252d1caf7416c0866d1723c2aa	No you don't sound like your crazy at all.  If you two keep coming back together then there is good reason to think that you might be able to work it out.<br>  <br>  I sound like she really wants to be with you but that she is having a hard time getting a grip on the religion thing.  <br>  <br>  You two need to come to an agreement that you won't try to drag each other into whatever faith that you follow.  That can be done---you don't bring it up and you don't mention it to each other.<br>  <br>  Christians think everyone but them is wrong and that if they don't get them turned around then their loved one is going to get toasted in hell.<br>  <br>  You need to explain it to her like you did here---you are articulate and obvioulsy intelligent---It sounds like you two can work this out.|`|yte0BzXKaa	I agree with the first answer, she's confused and doesn't know what she wants.<br>  Give her time and she'll figure it out.|`|p07tQsziaa	why dont u just move on?|`|AA11071040	She is confused about what she wants.  The best thing for you to do is not read into anything and just go with it.  It sounds like she wants to be with you and share her life with you.  Is the different religions REALLY that much of an issue?  Can it really come between you and not allow you to have a relationship?  Go to the movies and dinner and don't expect anything out of it.  Be her friend and when she realizes, for the 100th time what a great catch she has, she will come around and commit.  The next time she wants to take a break, be OK with it and if she doesn't contact you in a week or so, text her asking her if she misses you yet.  You will know what is going on if she texts you back.  If not, then it was just plain not meant to be.|`|EcgO4dlnaa	Well, she may mean and and she may not. It's totally up to you if you give it another shot. If your not up to a possible heartbreak then just don't even bother. <br>  You could try to give her another shot but don't get your hopes up. I learned that from experience. When you get your hopes up heart break hurts more.|`|U4ek1lCLaa	Sounds like she has too much going on right now with her traveling and modeling career and your not at the top of her list unless she gets lonely and needs somebody there she knows you will be there because she knows you really like her. BTW how old are you guys that kinda matters too. Until she realizes your a good guy and like the saying goes, you don't know what you have until it's gone is very true for a reason. I would give it some time and give her space if she is smart she'll come running back to you! If not don't worry it wasn't meant to be.

The fact is that a mind is a very individualistic thing and a general rule is hard to codify. The thought patterns do seem to differ in men and women but we do share the same instincts of survival of the individual and survival of the group (that means sex). We also share the same hormones but in different ratios.<br>  <br>  Every primate species has unfaithful females thus proving that the alpha male is not the only male females are attracted too...in other words: females, even monkeys, like sex.<br>  <br>  I believe your lady is trying to refer to the old myth that women are faithful because sex does not interest them but it is normal for males to want multiple conquests.<br>  <br>  She just wants it understood that love, not sex, is the deciding point for her as it is with a man.

Don't think it would be healthy or worth your time to try to find closure by focusing on this additional negative event.  Just hope you both are certain that divorce is really what you want.

EBGdlo35aa	1) Why do people push religion and/or the Bible on people -- especially in regards to marriage?<br>  <br>  Is someone forcing you to marry?  That is against the law!<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Don't people realize that our country was founded on freedom of religion?<br>  <br>  Certainly.  Is someone forcing you to marry according to the religious rites of a particular sect?<br>  <br>  <br>  3) Whether or not someone is religious is SUPPOSED to be a personal choice, however I hear things like "It's against the law because the Bible says it's wrong."<br>  <br>  Here you are confusing many things - morality with religion, and religious freedom with separation of church and state (which, in fact, has nothing to do with morality in any case).<br>  <br>  But, let's cover morality first.  Now, cannibalism is wrong, do you agree?  And yet, historically, very many cultures practiced cannibalism.  Right and wrong (from a humanistic standpoint) are *subjective*.  Maybe some of those people in cannibal cultures thought that cannibalism was wrong.  They were probably the next eaten.<br>  <br>  In OUR society, right and wrong - *legal* right and wrong - is determined by the majority of voters or by their representatives.  It is NOT determined by ANYTHING else.  It is not religion that is being forced on you - it is majority rule.  Our society was designed with that very intent.<br>  <br>  Now, it may very well be that it is because the majority of voters are Christian that much of our laws parallel Christian morality - but it is not Christianity that is being made law, it is (as always) the will of the majority of people.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) What I DON'T understand is why you think it should be against the law instead of just minding your own business?<br>  <br>  OK, let's go back to the cannibalism example.  If a general vote were taken for a law permitting cannibalism, would you support it or oppose it?  I guess that you would appose it, and I guess that you would oppose it because you believe it is WRONG.  This, in spite of that fact that, for millennia, people have practiced cannibalism and felt no moral qualms about doing so.<br>  <br>  Now, consider a Christian's point of view.  A general vote is taken on a law that prohibits behavior that we consider immoral.  It could be murder, it could be theft, it could be gay marriage.  To us Christians, all 3 are WRONG.  Should we not support laws that restrict wrong behavior, just as you would support a law that restricts behavior that **you** consider wrong?  In fact, wouldn't it be delinquent of our civil duty if we failed to support a law that restricts wrong behavior?<br>  <br>  <br>  4) And why won't some people stop pushing the Bible on others? Freedom of religion means they have a CHOICE whether or not they want to listen to what a book says.<br>  <br>  No - freedom of religion says that people have a choice regarding whether they *believe* what a book says.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|asxqampCaa	All people push their agenda - whatever it is - regardless of what you or anyone else thinks.<br>  <br>  We all have an agenda.

Is divorce a bad thing? Or is it just "live and let live" and do whatever you want? <br>  We'll go the extreme: Did Hitler do wrong? Not according to the 100 million+  Germans that fully embraced what Hitler said as the truth! He did exactly what he wanted and gathered millions to follow him. There was nothing wrong with what he did because so many people said that it was "okay". See? <br>  It is not about freedom, for Hitler had all the freedom to do as he pleased. Do not think that this was an anomoly. This is what you are asking. Morals are not arbitrary ideals. They are essential human values that set a foundation for worthwhile human growth, peace and prosperity. Without a defined set of moral guidelines, everything goes in the toilet. And where do these moral guidelines originate? Guess what? From the Bible! This is why fundies are so argumentative about Bible thumping. It is where society gets it's foundation from and nothing is greater than the foundation of marriage. One marriage of one man and one woman is the basis of our human existence. Face it. There can be no children except by that union. Children raised in the nuclear family have the best chance for a stable life and then into the next generation ........ and the next and the next......... <br>  Yes. Any two people can raise any child, but if it's not one man / one woman - you are going to get it all twisted around. <br>  I do counseling and I see the damage from other than a "normal" family. Correct - this does not mean that anything else will not work. It's just that it takes something really outrageous to make the outrageous work. <br>  If gay marriage is allowed - what's next? Two men a woman? Three men? Six women? Do not laugh. That is what you propose if you go outside the boundary of what God established. We have two sexes for a reason and that reason is to raise children up to be really good individuals. <br>  This life is not to see what you can get away with, but to see how good a person you can be. To love one another and support one another. To raise healthy children to become healthy adults. To bring ALL people under the banner of safety and compassion so we ALL can have a fulfilling life. <br>  Go ahead and be gay. Have 10 wives. But do not indoctrinate children into thinking that this is right! It is hideous behavior and to prove it - in one generation it should be gone. It is not because YOU have been brainwashed into thinking that it is moral to do what ever one wants. <br>  Hussien proved you wrong. <br>  Hitler proved you wrong. <br>  Every despot proved you wrong. <br>  Children should not be your LAME excuse! They should be the glory of humankind........and they are not. <br>  This is where we have travelled. You need to rethink the value of our children.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	Heather, normally you and I agree on most things. that's why I have you in my contacts list.  on this one though, I think we are going to be on opposite sides of the issue.  <br>  <br>  Most of our laws are centered around biblical principle; thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill, though shalt not commit adultery.  <br>  <br>  Our country was not only founded on freedom  of religion, but it was also founded on biblical principles.  The 10 commandments are not just guidelines they are orders from God on how "we the people" are supposed to conduct ourselves in daily living.  No nation or individual could ever hope to uphold all of those commandments.

I also have studied civics and history.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage sounds find to me.<br>  <br>  Polygamy is a real mess. I'd never want to live in a country that allowed it. It is always abusive to women. How can you have any dignity when you have to share your half of the power in the marriage with another woman? Have you actually ever seen any real research about polygamy? It's even dying out in primitive countries.<br>  <br>  Since religion doesn't guide me, I want to be very careful I understand the social, ethical and legal implications of institutions like marriage before I make changes.|`|ULUpOqplaa	The best way to get people to rally around your particular flag is to get them to all hate something in particular.  People doing things that other people don't like or are jealous of since they don't have the courage to do it themselves is a good rallying cry.  And about 2000 studies later they have concluded that children raised in gay or lesbian homes, if they are not abusive homes to begin with, are better adjusted than the norm.|`|f8CN2qIvaa	This is probably a better question for the R&S section.  As an atheist, I agree with you.  I think those who push religious laws on everyone forget that what works for them may not work for those who do not follow their religion.  It is better to have a set of secular laws that apply to everyone, regardless of religion or sexual orientation.  I have no problem with gay marriage at all, but I do wonder about polygamy.  In some cultures and religions it is an accepted practice.  It has acquired a bad rap, though, due to some Mormon sects forcing young girls into polygamous arrangements.  If polygamy is allowed, it must only involve adults, and they should have an understanding of what they are getting into.   It's not for everyone.  I'm quite happy with one wife, and I know for a fact that my wife would not share me with another woman.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm with you on issues of gay marriage and polygamy.  (As for the latter, I wonder why your answerers seem to assume you are referring exclusively to situations involving one man and multiple wives, rather than also one woman with multiple husbands. Hm.)  However, I am going to put myself into the ironic position of "devil's advocate" by answering from the fundamentalist Christian perspective my parents teach.<br>  <br>  To many people, religion isn't just a dusty book with old-fashioned speech in it.  To them, religion is a living, active relationship with God, the ultimate author of the Bible.  God lives and interacts with the world and the people in it every single day, and often.  But in addition to being a loving and forgiving Father, God is also a watchful and vigilant punisher of evil.  The Bible is peppered with accounts of God punishing entire nations, or even the world, for sinfulness, the most famous of which is probably the Great Flood in which He wiped out nearly the entire population of the world.  Sure, we now have the sacrifice of Jesus to wash away our sins, but that wrathful God still exists.<br>  <br>  This all leads to the natural conclusion that God sides with the righteous nations, and sides against the unrighteous, and I do mean actively, and in the present tense.  To allow the passage of laws overturning Christian principles would surely invite the wrath of God, and would turn God's favor against our blessed nation.  Therefore, for everyone's good, Christian and heathen alike, it is imperative that laws banning sinful practices be upheld.  How foolish it would be to risk God's wrath by turning our nation's laws against His scriptures!<br>  <br>  This is not a joke.  If you think there aren't millions of Americans who believe this way, you are deluding yourself.  I no longer support their agenda, but it doesn't mean I've lost my understanding of it.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I agree with you. I don't care for the Bible so called do gooder's either!  Their all hypocrites when it comes to "different" things in life, other than their opinions of "relationships".<br>  <br>  I can see why  some feel they should marry into their own religion, but come on..........we're all human beings.  Religions also start wars!  What does that tell you about religion???   It's sure not the love for other man kind.|`|EgA87yR0aa	It is simple actually.  Tele-evanglist types need power and so they find minority groups they can pick on.  By making the minority seem dangerous, they become leaders of a cause (saving people from the minority group)  Secondly, people think they should help save other people from hell.  If they really believe in hell, then this would seem a very noble thing to do.|`|48Q4XUA5aa	For me it all started with God, not religion, thas just a buncha rules, your heart doesnt have to be in it, in order to do something religiously.<br>  <br>  I don't push it on others, as my bible doesnt tell me to do that. Folks who wanna learn about God go to church, period.<br>  <br>  As I see it God invented marriage for his purpose.  I happen to believe he is runnin things here on Earth. Anything other than that is a man made, man-serving variant.<br>  <br>  I don't bash folks for what they do, God is the judge on that.  I have a way in which I live, and it just happens to be by the word of God.<br>  <br>  Now I aint perfect because of that. In fact soooo far from it. That is why I need him, the lord, that is. I aint on no soap box. This is my personal relationship with God. It's what " I" do. <br>  Anything other that that is backwards, for me, since I'm just passin through here.<br>  <br>  Trust me. It's HARD to follow Christ when you have soooo many ' socially / politically correct loop holes. It has to be a divine effect on one's life. Heck otherwise I'd have an anything goes attitude as well!|`|YIElevidaa	1.) The country was founded on freedom from religion and Christian/Deism. It's not clear that's why there is conflict. <br>  <br>  2.) I agree with the rest of what you say.<br>  <br>  3.)Except polygamy. Women are a scare resource. A societal structure that allows for some men to have many women takes away the wife's of many men. This cannot lead to a utopia in any seance of the word. Disharmony is inherent in all societies at all times that have allowed men to have multiple wife's as a commonplace and accepted concept with few exceptions.|`|djUMvICoaa	Why are some people so caught up in the bible?  They want to believe that these first laws that man ever had to follow are still the corner stone of life, no matter how misguided they may be in trying to apply them.  They are firm believers in heaven and hell and believe they are trying to save you from hell.  Hell, I don't give a damn, I know it's only an opinion, just as mine might be, but we still like to be heard.  But how do you contend with the fanatics?  By letting them not get to you.  That is the only thing that you have that you can control.  Just as there really isn't that many trying to push religion down our throats, there are the same small numbers that speak out on other issues that may and may not need addressing.  Is that good?  Maybe, depends upon how they go about it and if they are respectful to you or not.  But sometimes there is that little group that can crawl under our skin and really eat away and it looks like it's religion for you, yet in the overall scheme of things that is a  pretty petty thing and few people to worry about.  There are much bigger issues in this world that can use our attention that involves many more people and would do a much better good.  So where are your bible thumpers on this same issue?  They are wrapped up in small things because they are still thinking small.  Rise above them, it's only a few and only opinions.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I totally agree with you when it comes to pushing religion on someone, I for one don't like it  at all and I choose the bible because I want to, not because someone shoved it down my throat. As far was me caring about what gays do, and why someone chooses to have 6 spouses, I could care less. But ...what I do care about is when these gay couples want to be married and it is supposed to be looked upon in our society as a husband and wife union. This is not possible, these are 2 males or 2 females. Since the beginning of time, marriage has been between two people of the opposite sex. Again, I could care less, and I don't think they are entitled to anything that the law provides for  male/female marriages.. Okay lets talk about the man with 3 wives ...This man has up-teen children with these 3 woman and it is my tax dollars that support them. This man couldn't possibly make enough money to do it.. The men or woman need to stand up and take responsiblity for their own offspring. It is not my job to support someone other than  my own immediate family. I am sick of it...And we all have our opinion, now don't we??|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	It's simply a part of freedom of religion that people are exercising, dear one.  Also, freedom of speech.  lol<br>  <br>  Do you not see the irony of your question?  Freedom of religion isn't freedom from religion.  The idea is that no one will be punished by the state for exercising their religious (or non-religious) freedoms.  Don't over-use this right, it isn't really even enforceable against the citizenry.<br>  <br>  There are social reasons for public policy against polygamy that largely benefit women and children (whether you care to go there or not).  We have plenty of psycho-social research that shows children do best in a home with their biological parents, absent abuse factors.<br>  <br>  And we have plenty of research which shows us that psychological and sexual abuse of children goes up in homes with non-biological parents.<br>  <br>  But, regardless of any of this, our nation is a Constitutional Republic (a democratic-republic, if you prefer) and our public policy is made by elected representatives.  So, if the majority of Americans still adhere to Christian dogma and morality, the majority of our laws will continue to reflect this.<br>  <br>  BTW:  There hasn't been enough TIME to conduct meaningful research about the effects on children being brought up in gay households.  It hasn't been occurring in large enough numbers for a long enough TIME.  And you think it's okay to conduct experimentation with CHILDREN, or simply base it on your ANECDOTAL personal experience.  And some of us do NOT.

One day he might have woken up and really seen you and realised that he had what he wanted right in front of him.  Instead, you left him and the world being what it is he met someone who made him laugh - potent medicine that.  You shouldnt feel angry bitter and resentful - it isnt his fault.  If there is any anger it should be with yourself for not giving it more of a chance perhaps.  It could also be that you just werent the right one for him - that you couldnt be the one who would make him get over his ex.<br>  Its hard but sometimes we just have to accept that thats the way it is.<br>  You now have to pick yourself up, dust yourself down and move on.  Put it down to experience.  You will find someone to love and your life will be the richer for it - but dont contaminate it with bitterness and anger for something that you cannot change.<br>  You wont find a partner all the time you are giving off these bad resentments - be happy and attract people who want to see you smile.<br>  Heartache is horrible but we do recover and can even be stronger for it.<br>  So try and be strong and put it all behind you and move on.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	"I feel really angry, bitter and resentful.

It is Muhuratam which decides the time.|`|cWuumdy7aa	it depends on Muhurat there are muhurat in day and night both and themarriage are performed at muhurt time, its not only in the night|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	It is provided in Hindu, vedic marriage ceremony.  On the other hand, Sikh marriages are solemnised during the day. It is a matter of convenience.|`|GdJTQX6raa	it is not all Hindu Marriages that take place at night. In south India Brahmin's marriages are conducted for three days. other hindu marriages almost finish in the morning.In north India i have seen and attended many marriages at night. Eastern part of India also has night marriages. I think this goes with muhurat.|`|AA10354635	It depends on Mahurat or Lagna in Bengali it may be at evening or late night|`|QFf9phAmaa	it is ghost marriage|`|qamSsjXHaa	yes<br>  <br>  But , sometimes it happens at day time also depending the kundali ( janampatri ) of the couples .|`|syf0oMrkaa	ya it is right that most of hindu marriages happen during late night, but it is depends upon muhurt

Get to know each other and be caring. Wish you happy marriage and lifelong relationship.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	Uh, this is why arranged marriages are bs. You don't even know this person and you need to ask all these important questions on yahoo answers. So sad. I am a firm believer in knowing your partner before marrying them or else most likely it will not work out. You can't force yourself to like her and vise versa.  This is a form of abuse if you ask me and lack of any understanding of what a marriage is.  I don't think this type of behavior should even be considered marriage. It's more slavery.  You can't expect some chick to take her pants off just cos you're married.  Gosh most people look down on people who sleep with someone the night they meet or even as soon as a few days, but it's expected in this culture... all because of a piece of paper.... <br>  <br>  good luck to you, but I wouldn't expect much as you don't even know this woman and nor does she know you.. <br>  <br>  Strict... i don't know what you mean by that, but just cos you get married doesn't mean you can now tell her who to be and what to do. If my husband ever tried that crap with me.... i'd divorce him. You are a complete stranger that has no authority over here married or not. You better keep this strict crap out of the playing field till you actually know her... even then, you don't own her.|`|AA10101934	Do not be strict, marriages are work just talk with her and you'll understand each others perspective.  Don't expect her to just be ready to have sex with you, she will probably out of duty but will not want to.  Listen to her and she will listen to you.  Treat her with respect and she will do you the same.  I'm sure that's not what is taught in your culture since it is a prearranged marriage but that is the trick to making it work.  And remember no relationship is perfect, all have their ups and downs.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Go easy in bed the first few nights.  It's painful for the woman if she's a virgin.|`|82c2ilpEaa	I think that if she is going to marry with you is because she actually loves you, so you don't have why to be strict or nothing like that (coz you will loose her) just be yourself! and be really kind with her, trying to have a good relation ship with her just as if you were living with your partner flat ;)|`|i6Th0lItaa	That sucks. Just be nice to her and she'll like you. Don't be very strict.

Just don't take her comment too hard. Enjoy the rides and look forward for the next ride.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Come on. She is probably just trying to have fun with you.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should get better at lasting more than 2 minutes. Focus on that instead of you pettiness.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	You can say something like "still, people are lining up hours for this two minutes.."|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I don't believe you, judging by the way you warm up a horse with oats and stuff. I seriously doubt the ride is short. I think the problem is your wife just doesn't want to go to DisneyLand. Maybe if you dressed up as Goofy or something, that might help. I've always wanted to go to Disneyland...|`|AA11447210	You're a big boy, you can choose your own emotions. Either you are insulted or not when someone says something to you.

Just keep up with the flow that you're doing being distance and let him earn the respect for you more and earn your loving energy, thats if you like him.<br>  <br>  but if you feel that he may treat you like he treated with all of his "victims" tell him to Fck off!|`|Zyy7isCeaa	Guys have this fantasy that they are sex gods, and they need lots of women.

As women, we always want to believe that we will be the one that will change their ways, but it NEVER happens like that. It just doesn't. If this guy is convincing you he's changed his ways, be on guard that he isn't just telling you what you want to hear to get your virginity. Some guys hear a girl is a virgin and think of it as a challenge.<br>  <br>  I know that you like this guy and he seems nice enough, but it's easy to be deceived by a guy when you like him b/c you want to believe what he says. Don't buy into it too quickly, and don't let your guard down.
IPS3hWweaa	Brilliant answer Internet Hate Machine. Why couldn't I come up with such a clever line?<br>  <br>  <br>  You should try wearing skimpy clothes or something a little bit more revealing. Maybe he'll get more interested in you. Just keep trying to get his attention but not to the point where he'll find you annoying.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	If he wants you to wear skimpy clothes, I think you know what he is looking for. I would make him history and find someone else. You already said that he doesn't like you, then why flirt with him? He will keep flirting with you untill he gets what he wants and then you will never see him again. Be careful.|`|IdKUf5WGaa	This isnt the answer your looking  for but its the truth because the same thing happened to me.<br>  If he doesnt like you like you said, but wants to see you in skimpy clothes, then he probably just wants your body.<br>  Alot of guys are like that. He wants to get some from you and nothing more and If you lower your standards to wearing skimpy clothes thats the only thing thats going to happen. He will want to bang you even more and nothing more. You need to stay strong and make him like you for YOU not your body.<br>  best of luck :)|`|CR7arBmbaa	He likes you! Duh!<br>  It's just so much fun to flirt!<br>  Keep it up and even give him a dose of his own so to speak.<br>  <br>  Put on a skimpy top and be all like " Do you liiiiiiiike it  - wink wink"<br>  exaggeratedly like he was with "i will see you tonightttt!" all flirty like. ...and then be like "oh sorry....gotta go....." and walk away laughing.<br>  <br>  He'll practically crawl over to you on his knees!!! : P<br>  <br>  He wants you to play along....<br>  no worries  :  )<br>  Laugh alot with him....make it alot of fun.|`|AlDUph0Paa	if ou like him ask him if he likes you and if not just as him why he is flirting and stuff with you.|`|HB0IivI3aa	i reckon he likes u, but u just dont think so ask him out and say like just see wot its like stuff like tht

She is holding a baby and yells out that I should look after my son. Then my friends haul her out and it gets rough. She drops the "baby" and it falls to the floor, causing her to scream hysterically. It would be hilarious. Also, if she still wants to get married before I tell her the truth, I know she truly loves me.
a9edf71cdaa0f9ac307e3492a0235c8faa	He may be interested but let me tell you something. The purpose of using text is the ability to hide and mask your feelings behind a piece of technology. You may easily be trying to read into something that doesn't deserve that much attention. However, I do think that he feels you're attractive. I didn't say he likes but, but he thinks you're hot. Don't read too much into the text unless he voices his opinion about you in person. Then it's when you should read the signs that he's into you. And "babe". . . Don't let it get to your head...a lot of guys say that but it's an endearing form of nickname. Ask him straight up what's his deal...Not like that but ask him if he's into you or what. Then if he says yeah. Then go for it. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|O3x3uecIaa	He likes ya. xD Truust me.

Step back and next time he makes degrading comments like that speak up and tell him you don't want to look sexy for guys and like your hair just the way it is.|`|82dfc8c5fdf36779ac231646803120f5aa	I think his gay lol|`|JF0SIngqaa	I wouldn't go blonde just to please someone else.

It is easier to go dark than lighten.|`|4ltupRctaa	lol.. 14..<br>  dont give it another thought. your so young!! if you like him just say so, if not forget it. dont sit around thinking what could that mean?! but it does sound like he was flirting with you.|`|SxqYguUCaa	To me, it seems like he didn't complete his sentence. :P<br>  Maybe he thinks you'd look hot with blonde hair!|`|798SjCdlaa	probably likes blonds and wants to see what you look like as a blond
EcgO4dlnaa	I'm sorry to say that there really isn't any way to MAKE him like you. If he is going to be like that then forget him. He's definitely not worth it. But I know that its not easy to just forget about someone you love. Its okay. It will take time. Just try and focus on the guys that only like one girl at a time. <br>  I understand your frustration. Its hard to move along in life when the guy you love and that supposedly loves you wants to hook up with other girls.<br>  I have been going through a similar situation. My story is a little different though. But the bottom line is I want him to love me and not any other girl. <br>  Its hard to sit there knowing how badly you want someone just for yourself. Especially when they are making that very difficult.<br>  Sometimes you may cry yourself to sleep at night thats okay. <br>  Don't worry over time you will start to realize that he's not worth it. <br>  Either that or he will realize that your worth it and not any other girl.<br>  I promise that if he doesn't come to his senses to see how great you are then he definitely not worth it. <br>  I know right now it seems like you will NEVER get over your feelings for him but you will.<br>  Every girl deserves a guy that will treat her right and save his love for just her and no other girl. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck and I hope things work out for you,<br>  <br>  <br>  xox Devon xox|`|62CyxnZuaa	omg i have the same problem!!!<br>  he always tells me he loves me then he goes out with my best friend!!<br>  i mean wtf<br>  i tried to forget about him.. but i love him sooooooo bad<br>  so idk wat to do either lol|`|Zyy7isCeaa	Find out about his interest, then spend time learning about them, then you can have conversations about what he likes, also be a bit more flirty, and if none of this helps then do the same to him, flirt with other guys, the thought of losing you should stop him; or he's not worth it|`|EjV3rIvJaa	austin has to realise HE NEEDS YOU<br>  <br>  gosh he is an idiot sometimes<br>  <br>  grrr..... he needs to admit eh like syou & then we can plan more fairytales...<br>  <br>  <br>  tell him you gonna kill yourselff...<br>  <br>  then i will talk to him on msn saying how sad you are... HE WILL CRACK!|`|32xAPpvvaa	i got bad news for you .... hes a player!!1
q8vILEpfaa	Yes<br>  <br>  <br>  I was in public speaking and would speak before crowds of 5 to 6 thousand. I have been taught well, my mentor would never say a thing about my presentation until I asked. His answer never changed. He would say "Now that you asked me"<br>  <br>  If the shoe fits where it!  (make sure it's your shoe)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Try not to correct on your friends if they don't ask your opinion.  You don't want them to think that you are against their point of perspective.  Keep it to yourself.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Don't give your opinion unless asked, and maybe not even then. Trust me on this.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Correcting people when they're wrong ALL the time, can get annoying from time to time. You need to do it with some tact. Sensitive people could get hurt from how you word things. And nobody likes the feeling of being stupid when someone it always there to correct them. <br>  <br>  Just be careful on how you do it and maybe hold back and not say something when somebody is wrong. Start singing a song in your head to ignore what they just said. lol.|`|SxqYguUCaa	Yes probably.<br>  I hate when people tell me I'm wrong and correct me- even If I am wrong!<br>  Just keep your lips sealed when around friends.<br>  It can be really offensive, even when you don't need mean to be.<br>  They probably think you get a kick out of being right and having so much knowledge. But it's one thing to be smart and proud about it. It's another to correct people- you are indirectly shoving it in their faces.|`|fs8wMQLFaa	They're your friends. They shouldn't care if you're prideful or not. <br>  Correcting can get annoying, but I don't think that's what they mean. Do you ever act as if you are better then them? Maybe that is the case.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Hugs, Smiley
bkR9P0Otaa	its when a girls hymen breaks there is usually some blood but its normal. and dont worry its okay to not know!|`|AA12316366	ask your mom or dad.|`|AA10928214	Breaking the hymen, sometimes there's blood|`|4gC38fKsaa	there's a female sex organ called the hymen that when you have sex for the first time, stretches and bleeds. not all girls have it, and some don't bleed at all.
xA1fdVimaa	if he cheated on you once, & you still don't trust him, you need to let him go.  this party is setting the stage for bad news.  if he had been faithful to you, then it would have been fine.  drop him now before you get hurt (because you're gut is screaming at you that it's about to happen ... it's the only reason you asked this question).|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	If your friend took a gun to their head, would you?<br>  <br>  You shouldn't assume your bf  does what his friends do.<br>  <br>  Sounds like trust is an issue you 2 need to talk about and work on.|`|XnEnelsBaa	Without trust you have nothing! Are you expecting a leopard to change his spots? Trust needs to be earned. If you make a big issue of it, you could easily drive him into the arms of another. People need space to breathe.<br>  <br>  You have to ask yourself, is this the kind of life you want to lead long term? Better to know now before marriage and children. If someone cheats on you early on, they are doing you a favour! So you can move on to someone more suitable.<br>  <br>  An exciting fun partner may be great to start with but in the long term may prove to hot to handle! Do you want to father his children, when he goes off with someone else?|`|omalHCZ1aa	If you don't trust him, you really need to re-examine this entire relationship. If youre worried sick over this party because theres the potential that he will cheat, think of how many more opportunities there will be for him to cheat in the future. Are you going to worry every time?|`|Ism92isCaa	Why aren't you going to the party?<br>  What kind of party is it?<br>  If you want to find out signs of 'cheating', search the internet or google it. It's definitely out there.|`|4O1wAwayaa	Just b/c his friend is a sleazeball doesn't mean he is. But if you don't trust him, you can never trust him.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	If he's cheated before as well, you have full rights not to trust him now. My question to you is, why are you still with him. Cheating is a good way to show a person how little you think of them. It's a good way to show that you don't care.<br>  <br>  But, if you really wanna stay with him, my advice is to give him a little bit of trust. Of course you have to give him just enough rope to hang himself with, but it's kinda a two edged sword here.<br>  <br>   If you want to check up on him, and still let him go (if you have control over that) either go with him, or find/send someone to the party who you trust to make sure he doesn't leave with someone else or whatever. <br>  <br>  You're not over reacting. If your relationship is amazing then he will really not cheat on you. Look at the details about his previous cheating and match them to this party. If it almost seems the same I would bet he will cheat. If they are different circumstances, he might not.|`|9HCA1sdlaa	Well....once a cheater always a cheater. I do see exceptions to this...hope he is one of them. Go to the party with him! Will show that he is taken and u can both have fun. If he doesn't want u to go then that's suspicious. Ur both in the same age range I assume and there shouldn't be a reason for u not to go. Regardless. DON'T trip on him until he does do something cuz that will just add towards the mentality that u are just trippin. If he does do something, expect him to get distant, maybe depressed, and very suspicious of you. He will try to turn the tables and make it look like u are doing something wrong.  And if he does, ur worth more than that.
GG90f0yxaa	Im in the same boat my friend. Don't let her get you down, there is nothing wrong with you. You only see what you want to see, realize she is your mother and that you only have one. Try showing her that you love her, give her a kiss or a huge every now and then. Be yourself!!|`|QFf9phAmaa	because you donot obey your mom|`|SxqYguUCaa	Your mom doesn't hate you. She just sounds really crabby. If it bothers her, stop talking about it. Just shut her out. If she's being a b*tch then let her be.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Your mom doesn't hate...moms don't hate their children. It sounds to me like maybe your mom would appreciate if you would help her out around the house some. She probably is tired...sounds like she's always doing something, while you watch. Ask if she needs help once in a while. I think you'll be amazed by the change that comes between you two. Good luck hun|`|Vc6eNci9aa	i sometimes get real crabby at my kids... but they write me a note and i lighten up. i just give them a hug and say, "I'm so sorry I've been avoiding you." write her a note or sit down and talk to her like my older kids do.|`|gtec2vZIaa	she doesn't hate you. she loves you. stop whining and give her a hug.|`|8n0BQkJoaa	maybe you should talk to your mom and tell her how you feel,
JF0SIngqaa	I would be honest with her that's what friends do. Let her know that this makes you tense and depressed and that you don't like spending time with her any more. If she cares she will try not to do this when you are with her. If not then she doesn't respect your friendship.|`|xrEIAD2aaa	If you're such good friends that you at least owe her the respect to tell her how you feel.  If she gets mad then at least you know you tried to talk to her.  After that you could distance yourself, but stay in the picture.  She could just be going through something.  Good friends can be hard to find.|`|2eztcCO0aa	Distance yourself from her, but first tell her why.  Maybe that will encourage her to take a look at herself and change.  But if you just tell her and then continue to be her friend, she will think that what's she's doing is okay and keep doing it.|`|SxqYguUCaa	Either/Or.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep her as a friend, talk to her. If you feel that the friendship is over and her negative energy is too much to deal with, just cut her off.<br>  <br>  Who needs negative people in their life?|`|xezI4AlNaa	Turning down a suitor is her prerogative, but turning down men always as you've mentioned is not healthy.She might be having issues. Dont get rid of her. Talk to her and find out why. She needs help.|`|ep5oRNBCaa	u should not talk to her for her bad habits but u should maintain distance from her....|`|aHER8myJaa	why don't you try hooking her up with a good hot guy?|`|SBpl494Uaa	Thats up to you, either end the friendship or try and work it out. What do you want? If you never talked to her again, would you care? If the answer is no, you know the answer.
Us2bzL7Raa	Well take this from a girl who gets talked bout a lot. the best treatment for a rumor is to just dont listen to what there saying. they dont know u like tht. dont make such a big deal about it because the point of a rumor is to get the rumor all around and to hurt or get a reaction on the victim of the rumor. i learned tht if u make a big deal about it ppl are gonna talk more and more. in a very short amount of time the rumor will fade trust me. =] hope i helped

695cbbcba51ceed2403cffaf9486d103aa	WOW!! You are hurting and, it seems, with good reason. Your protective instincts toward your brother are very commendable. The danger is that they may create such passion in you that perception can get distorted.<br>  It is rather sad that people will praise you, and in the next breath will slag off your brother. Sad, because the praise is lost to you - and it is always nice to hear a bit of praise for our efforts.<br>  The result is that you feel surrounded by a bunch of pretty nasty people. But what can you do about it?<br>  Well you can't make them disappear, but you may be able to stop having contact with them. I would also suggest that you take a few moments to sit still and quiet for a few minutes. Think of your brother and all the positive things you see in him. Now write those things down. In future, when you are talking to people just quietly mention how much you care for your brother and give them a couple of items from your list. The secret is to stay calm and relaxed, that way the message will get through much more effectively. It is also helpful to recognise the down side of your brother's behaviour (as you do about the gambling). The reason for this is so that you can counter the generalised statements like "He's always gambling" with a response like "He actually gambled two or three times, several years ago".<br>  I hope this may help a bit, as I'm sorry to see your caring for someone causing you so much grief. All the best.
en5CeR8Faa	I believe he is and its kinda understandable... You never know what how his girlfriend may really feel. In my case i wouldn't like it at all and i might tell him i didn't want him talking to her as much. So don't really be worried. But since you know he's getting your text messages how bout sending one thats good for reading. Tell him you dont understand why he may be ignoring you. But you would like him to tell you why and that although you like him friendship comes first.|`|dSGmUiJ0aa	maby his girlfriend started getting mad about it, or another thing is he could like you but he likes his girlfriend also, so the only way to get out of the situation is to ignore it or run away from it, that's what guys do, in my oppinion i think you should wait until they breakup or look for someone else<br>  <br>  <3jess|`|CdG8UxiQaa	Maybe This is no help at all But thats just boys.They always act cool.So I think there is nothing to be worried about|`|36PrVK7Oaa	You better work on having a closer relationship with his girlfriend.

8V38MYL3aa	You obviously have insecurity problems because of your childhood, and they have followed you into your adult relationships.   Your boyfriend was originally attracted to you because of this.   It makes him feel more superior because he can control you by knocking your confidence all the time.   The best thing for you to do is leave him before he makes you any worse.   <br>  <br>  Try reading psychoanalysis books or get therapy into why you should have such deep rooted issues of unworthiness.   You sound like a very sweet, beautiful person and deserve someone who appreciates you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5s40kkxtaa	applying the same training on the "last" one the way that he applied the training on all the previous ones makes her sick in her stomach. utterly sick. when will this day come to see the lights of freedom on the horizon.|`|AA11984229	Being in a possessive relationship is very draining.  But I believe it also adds to your self esteem issues.  It did for me.  You're more important than he is simply because of the fact that it's your time and energy that is being used and he can't give that back to you.  I struggle somewhat with the self esteem issues still, so I'm not going to say much on that except:  it really helps to be around people who accept you for who you are and are not trying to change you.  Then you relax and be can be yourself.  It's a good starting point.  Changing your mindset about yourself comes from within, not from others.<br>  <br>  As for your bf, leave him sooner rather than later.

I wish I could take it back.<br>  <br>  But seriously, at least I didn't keep it bottled up inside. At least I'm telling her what is annoying me so she can stop and not make things worse.
uSUkZHBPaa	I sure wouldn't want to live in your situation.  "Mom" created this problem, and unless/until she changes her attitude, the only way your situation is going to change - is to get worse than it is now.  Mom doesn't really want you to have any say in what her daughter does, or doesn't do.  That's pretty plain when she tells you to be more assertive and then get upset when you are.  What do you think will happen when this child starts smart mouthing you, as well as running to mom, because you've told her not to do something, or to pick up after herself?<br>  <br>  You need to do some serious thinking about whether or not you want to stay in this situation.  Your gf does not respect you and is making sure that her daughter doesn't either.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If the mum keeps saying that then you have no chance in hell of that kid respecting you.|`|5P6m4Gs4aa	This is why I would never again live with someone who still has children living at home or likely to return home.<br>  <br>  Her father may be telling her that you are not her dad and she may be thinking she doesn't have to listen to you.  Actually, you are nothing to her.  You are her mother's friend only.  She didn't pick you.  You are viewed as an obstacle to her mother and father getting back together.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't try to be her parent.  I would refer her to her mother whenever she asked permission for something.  Otherwise, you will never be accepted by her.  If she comes to you, be there for her.  Trying to force your parenting on her will end up being battle after battle and you will always be the bad guy.  Her mother will never back you up and the daughter will play the two of you against each other like a fiddle.  Leave it all in the hands of her mother for the sake of your own mental health.<br>  <br>  Jack|`|XlGjBPBTaa	She has never cut the apron strings and until she does you come in 2nd every time.<br>  You have to decide what it is that you want.<br>  Her, or control.<br>  You decide then vote with your feet.<br>  She is not going to change so either stick around and put up with that crap or get on down the road and find someone more to your liking.<br>  You did not marry her and the child is not your kin so unless the sex is fantastic I see no reason to stay.<br>  If you really loved her you would have married her and moved far far away.|`|KjzV7sKWaa	Your not her father or her parent. get over it. if you want her to do something you should ask her mother to ask her. unless shes trying to play with something that belongs to you you should have no say.|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	It is not the fault that we are aiming at, are we?<br>  Since moving into the house, the girl, the mother and u are considered to be having a certain relationship. Everyone has to play a certain part in the house. Yes, as u state ur gf isn't making an effort in helping to build a bond between u and her kid. Futhermore, the girl we are talking abt spents quality time with her father(i guss). So, she might think that u are a intruder into their lives. I think the best solution would be to sit with ur gf and have a deep talk abt hw u feel and what both of u should do.Hope i helped!<br>  FreeHugs.|`|SxqYguUCaa	I'd expect that kind of behavior from a teen, not a little girl!<br>  But maybe, just maybe the girl's father tells her not to listen to you? Is that a possibility? Have your girlfriend ask the little girl if her father says anything about that. Well, since you aren't her dad, your authority over her would have to be decided over both the parents. If your GF get's mad when you tell the girl what to do, then just stop telling her what to do. Let her handle her herself.|`|jofuVL9Baa	You know what?...we are talking about a 6 yr old, who is probably going through a lot.  Just not having dad around is enough for any body to understand why she is reluctant to follow your direction, which sounds acceptable to me.  But like you said yourself, this has more to do with mom than with the child.  In this case, and even when the child is part of "the package", I think you will be seen as a better person both by your gf and the child, if you take this situation as "her child: her responsibility to discipline and educate her".  Only address TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND issues that affect you directly, such as aggressive or disrespectgul for no reason behavior towards you.  Don't see this as undermining your authority, see it as not your child, not your problem.  The child needs time (as much as needed) to get to know you, love you, respect you and accept you as authority.  But remember, even these (knowledge, love, respect and authority) are earned and in the case of a child under these circumstances, it takes time.  Maybe it'll take less time if you try this approach.  Hope it helps, be patient, Good Luck!|`|QFf9phAmaa	you put her in a creche she will learn how to obey|`|hokWD3Jjaa	Well you and your girl need to have a heart to heart and decide your roll as the parent in this situation.  Establish some ground rules and make the rules known to the little one.  If you have to watch her alone take away a privledge and let her know you mean business that's not being mean it's just part of being a parent.  Let the mom know when she is overstepping her bounds and undermining you so she can back off.  If not this might not be the relationship you want to be in.

And felt as if they deserved more. So while most of these feelings of loneliness and basic sadness may be contributed to aging, I do believe that some of this might be self inflicted? as many times we ourselves can be in a sense, our own worst enemy's, we have the mental capability of bringing about either happiness or sadness, it is all about the attitude. I am reading that you listen to music? not sure what your listening to, however most people who are truly depressed tend to listen to sad songs versus upbeat happy music, so if your listening to sad music or music that in a way has a lot of emotion behind it, stop, force yourself to listen to music that is fun and happy, and I don't care what it is, or who sings it, so long as it is fun, happy music. Also don't read, or watch anything that is associated with sadness or death, as this is also something that people who are depressed tune into, if you must, start watching I Love Lucy reruns, again, it doesn't matter what it is, so long as it is funny and happy. Also if you are a person who likes to eat sweets, stop that to, don't eat anything with refined sugar, if you enjoy coffee, limit yourself to one cup only, and if you like to drink be it on occasion or more so, quit. Basically what I am trying to explain to you is that you are what you eat, breathe, and absorb mentally. Not to say that I am this health guru who is perfect, as I am not, however I have been depressed before, and it amazed me how once I started to change my ways things got better. You have very little to no control over your husband, but you do have control over your very own being, once you start making some positive changes, you may be surprised to see that your once seemingly uninterested husband, begins to suddenly become more interested and curious to your new attitude, this isn't a over night thing, nor is it for sure that he will begin to come around and be all into you, but at this point you have nothing to lose, but everything to gain. So start focusing in on, making your life better for you, take care of you, and everything else will fall into place. I wish you all the best. Penelope|`|djUMvICoaa	He likes his sports, he's self centered, he likes playing with himself, solitaire that is, self centered, he likes to have his day talked about but doesn't worry about yours, self centered, he was a sperm donor, anybody could have done that, and he doesn't care about you, an idiot.  Love is a two way street, you have to meet somebody on it to know that it is returned, yours seems to be a one way street.  He has checked out, might have thought you payed more attention to the kids than him so he felt neglected, not too uncommon for some men, but when someone is trying to get the candle lit again and he isn't paying any attention, he has checked out emotionally, he now comes home to someone who raises his kids, does his laundry, makes his meals, and keep his house, but not a wife and it seems not a father.  So not only are you being hurt by this but so are your children.  When they are in a situation where it is void of love between their two parents they are missing some of the best lessons for a happy marriage.  Were his parents the same way?  You may love him but love isn't going to keep you from dying, you may have to consider other options to find fulfillment in yours and happiness for your kid's.|`|qQq23yziaa	It makes a lot of sense.

Bt1D1wWuaa	I think every state may have a different percentage but in Illinois, the ex husband has to pay 20% for one child.  Also, never, ever feel bad for asking for child support!  He helped bring this child into the world, therefore he has a moral and legal obligation to help provide whether he's in the child's life.  Don't  buy into all the sob stories because your child comes first and deserves to be provided for.....that will always be 1st and foremost!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I just saw your additional note saying you are not going through the courts here but this is being handled in Peurto Rico?  Gosh, I have no idea how that works....let me ask you some questions though;  Did you give birth here in the states?  Are you and the baby's dad legal citizens because as long as you and your baby are then you should pursue this here, not in Peurto Rico.  If you go after him in the courts here, then you can collect all the money he owes you from the time your baby was born until now.  Believe me, the courts are really going after these dads that aren't paying child support.  And they will do most of the work for you, all you'lll need to do is provide answers for them such as; where he lives, where he works etc. and they decide how much money based on what he earns and like I said, it's usually 20% of that amount.  Good Luck!|`|AA11538662	The court calculates how much support he will pay by his income.

They never change.Its pathetic really.|`|cbqNU5xeaa	I would say that if your sisters are being mean to you, That it might means they are either jelouse or intimiated by you. But it dos'nt mean they dont love you. Mabey you should talk to them, get there point of veiw. But remember to be the better person in this. I know how it feels when your family shuts you out, but dont take it too personaly. After all words are words and they mean nothing unless its from the heart saying 'I love you' in some way, shape or form. :- )<br>  Be happy chick.
m571yrLnaa	okay i think this would work<br>  <br>  on the day you go to school, be reaaaaaaly quiet. dont talk to any one. when "jacky" asks you whats wrong, tell him about some creeper that was trying to rape me on the internet, and now i am really scared for my life. <br>  <br>  he will try to calm you down and you will know its him :D|`|8SmoI2r1aa	Just don't bring it up . If he brings it up then ya'll can talk it out . But if he doesn't just leave things alone and talk to him at school and on yahoo .|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	Just ask him what his profile name is on MSN. It is probably not Jacky. There are a lot of creeps out there looking to prey on young girls like you.|`|nqhZ0Elraa	I would just ask him because if it wasn't him and he told your boyfriend you can't be blamed because you thought it was your friend. If it was him just tell him that he was acting different and you weren't sure if it was him or not. Because most likely if it was him he would be asking why you blocked him. I personally think it was somebody else at school joking around because I know I do that to some people. But of course I tell them afterwards.<br>  Haha<br>  Hope I helped:)|`|qH7IA1Staa	be like "heyy jackie some one by the name of jackie messaged me. was it u or my old camp bff jackie?"<br>  that should do it cuz if its not him he will think it was a girl who messaged u not a boy.|`|QFf9phAmaa	just smile with a buquette of flower

This is how life is. Get used to it... Or you can stop letting people take advantage of you. This is not your friend's fault nor is it your professor's fault. It is yours. This is life. Life is not fair. The sooner you come to terms with that the better off you will be. This is also what college/school is all about. Teaching you about life. You could learn biology sitting at home on the couch watching animal planet or reading a book. School teaches you about life. Whether you learn the lesson or not is up to you.|`|CBbsulYCaa	It is infuriating when this happens but it is too late to do anything about it now. Learn from this and move on.

Perhaps unconsciously you gave her the idea that her help isn't needed or that you can work on it alone. Sometimes friends act like that. <br>  <br>  What you can do is to stop thinking about what happened because it will just bother you and focus on what is ahead of you. Also, bear in mind that whatever has happened, you are still the one who worked on the assignment-that makes a lot of difference.
CRvdmFwCaa	I was in the same boat you were.  Non-Virgin girl dating a Virgin guy.  He pressured me into having sex with him though... saying I already had sex with someone else ... so whats the difference if I had sex with him.  That really hurt my feelings.  We'll We eventually had sex.  His new feelings were that.... Well... now you've have sex with 2 people and I've only had sex with 1.  We dated for about 3 years.  We broke things off for a couple months... which he proceeded to have sex with another girl he met.  We got back together and he told me now he was ready to be commited... cause we were "even" 2 to 2... meanwhile.... I hooked up with my Ex... He was in the Army and we always remained in contact as close friends.  So needless to say... we weren't "even"... I mean How immature?!... 5 years later I don't talk to either of them... ever.... and I'm married to a super awesome man!<br>  <br>  SOOOO... moral of the story!  It is important to be in a MATURE relationship before bringing in something as serious as SEX.  I would say just remain being friends.  DON'T have sex with him just because "you've done it before" Learn from your past... obviously having sex didn't really get your past relationship anywhere.  Wait until you guys are in a commited relationship.... Engaged, at least.... before having sex.  That way you know you love eachother for what the relationship is...and not leaving it up to how you do in bed.  <br>  <br>  He just sounds young and inexperienced.  Just becareful and don't hurt him.   Don't rush him.  Don't let him rush you.  Take time and really get to know eachother...there are SOOOO many other things to do besides have sex...and if you plan on being together forever... what's the harm in waiting until you are married! :)  There is nothing wrong with cuddling and holding hands... BUT the more intimate you get... the harder it is to hold off having sex.<br>  <br>  So Good luck... and may the relationship gods be with you!|`|3lV7ZY3raa	heres my advice, if your not ready for the consequences ie. std or a child, then dont have sex!!!|`|bvwYVGJOaa	My guess is he never even touched your hands..but it's also girls job to make their men feel good too, so just spontenuosly hug him from behind or have your arms around his neck or just cuddle him, he'll use his initiative to hold you too and comfortably.<br>  <br>  Just don't pressure him or indicate to him that you want it only when its both of your decisions and let it flow naturally and sex would not only be good but meaningful, i don't think he cares that much of your lost-virginity either.<br>  <br>  Just have sex when you're both ready..|`|RD0yaJlgaa	tell him what he should do, teach him what you know. I'm a virgin too and I know that I would be nervous when I do it. But I know I would feel great while doing it|`|uPL3e3tyaa	Swallow|`|W0kDKnYCaa	Darlin, if there is any true love involved here and not just desire Then love will work it out and find a way. Good Luck|`|IXskJPlVaa	If he is not that keen - wait for the right time. Till then nurture the relationship and see where it takes. By that time may be a lot of questions will have the answers and there will be a different perspective. Sex is mostly spontaneous - if that happens - decide on the basis of mutual feelings. Best of luck.|`|XsuVnHKOaa	Well,reletionship is based on trust so there is no need of lying to him.What ever b the case let him know because no matter what the TRUTH will come to light.Sit with him and sort things out.All the best.

I don't think that you necessarily have to be ugly to have a good heart.  There are some beautiful people inside and out.  Then again, what do you call good looks?  Everyone has a different view of what they think looks good or not.  You may be an average looking person and someone else may think you are hot!  It all depends on what that individual likes (feature wise and personality wise).  It's all a matter of what you are looking for/and willing to settle for.  You don't have to look like a model, but i think to some degree, looks do matter in selecting your partner, it helps for you to become attracted to that person. It also depends if this person with the good heart is close in you life that you begin to see their beauty, but for the most part in the beginning it's going to be appearance. For me, I going to be honest and say we all need a little bit of both.|`|XRi2H9ZVaa	What a question.<br>  <br>  Your in a crowded room and you suddenly see a guy and you think...I bet he has a heart!! Cobblers!<br>  <br>  Lets be honest ladies, you go for the looks. The heart has nothing to do with it. Don't care what you say, if you had a bloke with a great body stood next to a bloke with lesser body but good heart..old hearty boy is going home alone.<br>  <br>  You may say you would go with the bloke with the heart, but in reality you always go for the exciting bad boy..end of.<br>  <br>  Basically us chaps with hearts will always be on the losing side, and we must except that, or go the gym for a year!|`|eOCHKCRSaa	ON first attraction it is proven that women go for guys that they are physically attracted to. a lot of relationships develop from friendships to avoid that initial reaction.... otherwise if i were walking down the street and saw a guy with a heart and a smoking hot guy... well i think the hottie would win there...|`|9Zmj5B3haa	In 30 years from now a good looking guy will get old but a guy with good heart remains the same..<br>  <br>  <br>  All the best<br>  <a href="http://www.proenrichment.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.proenrichment.com</a>|`|DMlmyPxgaa	good looks are g8 but a heart is essential|`|UUrqECXIaa	The guy with the heart, every time.

It's as simple as that.|`|ikS4bAg9aa	i am bored...<br>  is your guy friend gay?|`|Te9odBWCaa	Well its all up to what you think. Sometimes when people are drunk, they say things that they don't really mean.<br>  <br>  But, at the same time, sometimes drunk people say things that they mean and just didn't mean to say it. If it looked to you like it just sliped out when he was wasted, and then he tried to change the subject like he had just realized what he had done, then chances are the guy really does love you but he didn't want to screw up your friendship by telling you.|`|oB1WQJHgaa	I'm sure he loves you... but if you don't want to hear it then tell him not to say that b/c your not dating and you have a bf.... plus if he is your best friend he will understand... :) hope I helped.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Just a wild stab, it could have been that he did mean it but knew he was gonna say it and just said it to see ur reaction.

There's no ignoring what is inevitable. No straight man and woman can ever be "really good friends" without something developing, and if he was gay, you'd know by now.<br>  <br>  Sorry. Chances are, though, that you'll make a great couple as soon as you dump that other guy. Just make sure to get really drunk the first time you hook up, because you don't want the first time to be the most awkward - it should be liberating.
48Q4XUA5aa	Wow. Well you have certainly said it all. I have this rule for myself. When I start to openly talk about stuff, just maybe among my friends, and much more among strangers, and even to a further extreme, to folks I have never seen (ie online personalities), It's time to DO something.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem like he's a good listener, since you have already went to counseling already.<br>  <br>  Put it alll out there. Let him see what you wrote down here. If he's got a molecule of salt in his whole body this will have to CLICK some sense into him.<br>  <br>  I soooo completely understand your view point. my aunt (a physician) once said to me "When your DONE with a man, he just can't do NUTHIN right"!<br>  <br>  Does this sound like you or what?<br>  <br>  Ok. if he doesn't listen, then Honey, work on movin out. We women figure out the basics and b4 you know it we GONE!  <br>  This is neglect at its finest if nothin more. Financial abuse... I can sooo see 2-3 grounds for divorce.<br>  <br>  Anything other than action on your part is asking for more BLATANT disrespect and punishment.<br>  <br>  By the way he is capable of empathy. Up until now he has had all that HE wants. He bout to lose his family. Unless he is rock he gone learn a big COSTLY lesson.|`|HbTInfYCaa	There are always 2 sides to every story, and there are 2 people in a relationship. It takes 2 people to make a relationship and usually 2 people break the relationship. Something about him obviously attracted you back then, you need to figure out what that was and focus on that. Way too many people do not take marriage serious enough. Did you not say for better or for worse? Now, saying that, I would never tell someone to stay in an abusive relationship, but you never said he hit you. Could there be something else that is occupying your time....they say that whatever we are investing our time in, that is what we are more passionate towards.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can not repair something if you do not work on it. Maybe you have no feelings for him anymore because you are spending your time elsewhere.|`|e5df938f156d6be3bb105ddd037ebe44aa	I came home from work yesterday and had an instant attitude. My husband asked what was wrong, and I replied, " I am home." We all make mistakes and make the wrong decisions. What we think will be a good thing slowly turns into a nightmare. Like you, I cannot support myself and my daughter enough to move out. It is so frustrating, to say the least. My hubby is a pizza delivery man at 42. Yes, I am grateful he has a job, but I expected so much more at this age. It is not what I want nor wanted. We tend to grow and mature and see that these things do not work anymore. I am sorry about your Mom. You must have been so scared back then. You are older and wiser now and you know what you want. Find a job. That is why you went to school. Get out there and try to support yourself and your daughters. Have faith in yourself and be positive. You can do this. Good luck.|`|iQOI5AfYaa	I know how you feel honey. Maybe 'trapped' would be accurate to describe it. Many people feel trapped in many differen ways. Think about it? Is this just an angry rant about your hubby? Do you cool down later and then don't think so badly of him? Or is this how you feel all the time?<br>  I know you said you cannot afford to move out on your own. Would marriage counselling help? Do you think he loves you? Does he try to make you smile?<br>  Though many can offer advise, this is a matter that you must resolve in your head yourself first. Nobody must actually 'influence' you either way. I hope you make the right decisions. <br>  Take care.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Have you tried seeing a counselor with him?  He sounds very selfish to me.  I'm really sorry you're going trhough this.  If he refuses counseling and you are still miserable, don't let money stop you from getting out.<br>  <br>  I think this has gotten pretty bad since you find him repulsive now.  Its tough because you have kids and money is tight, but if you are truly sad you need to put yourself first again and move on with life without him.  there are better men than this that would love to be with you.|`|tKIgqrTkaa	well if you honestly think that your marriage is over i think that you both should sit down and discuss what your Options are , see how he feels he may feel the same way if so then you need to work out how you both can live together but have separate lives , if you need advice how you both can achieve this then both of you go for Professional help may be a councilor or citizens advice these are free so go talk to either or both , if hubby wont come with you then go alone ,|`|xERwr6Ukaa	I'm so sorry that you feel this way. The one piece of advice that I can give you, is to take your whole family on a Sunday morning, and go to church.<br>  You married this man because you loved him, he definently needs to change, and I know you don't want your family to be torn apart. If you go to church and read the Bible, and just pray to God to help your husband.<br>  If you get your husband to God, I promise he will change for the better, it may not happen right away, but it will happen. <br>  Trust me when I say that God and Jesus love you and your family so much, that he would die on the cross for you. If you trust God that love that you had between you and your husband will rekindle.<br>  But if not, then you two can separate. But keep your faith in God, he will lift a huge weight off of your shoulders.<br>  I hope you follow this piece of advice, God Bless!|`|yUeOLSwfaa	The times ive heard stories like this, and the answer remains the same, you obviously want out of your marriage, so take steps to do this, just one step at a time.<br>  <br>  If you need some advice while you are doing this, feel free to contact me at my e.mail address on here.<br>  <br>  If you dont love this man, get out of this marriage while you are still young.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Well normally I dont advise couples to split up but you in your case I think its the best thing you could do for you. Something is wrong with your husband have you ever sat him down and asked him what is wrong with him? He has a lot of issues. You cant change him, and he can only change if he wants to get help and change. Sounds like this has been going on for years now. Is there anyway you can get someone to watch your girls so you can find a job and save up some money? So that you can move up? I know the economy is tough, but maybe there is something out there if you are really aggressive and can stand out in some way. Right now just tough it out until you find a job.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	You have made a series of choices that did not position you to be financially independent, including getting a BA degree in psychology.  You need to get a job where you have some potential to make good money over time.  It will be hard, but it will give you a chance to eventually leave your miserable marriage.|`|78BZKEuraa	your only in this world for a short time, why stay with someone that you don't like---leave|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Well, you've certainly grown up, and apart from this guy. He sounds like he would be a good match for my ex wife as they seem to share the same dysfunctional utilitarian values.<br>  <br>  You know from your studies how two people who are so completely different (moral and personal development), and are from different cultures can clash over basic lifestyle issues. So your judgement was clouded when you were younger for a number of reasons. Those are of interest only in a historical sense. I'm sure you've learned those lessons.<br>  <br>  Present situation for you is unbearable and for the sake of your daughters long term happiness and stability you have a difficult choice to make.  There is always an economic bottom line and this is especially true in your case.<br>  <br>  I would contact the people responsible for your student loans (payments, repayments dept) and renegotiate based on your present economic situation. If you are living in Ontario Canada I can give some specific suggestions, but since I'm not sure about that, I'll sit on those ideas for now.<br>  <br>  Most places have some sort of options that you could explore. I wonder what social work agencies in your area might be able to offer some specific advice for you. I almost hate to suggest a woman's shelter, but it also depends on how seriously you want or need to get out of your present situation. How hard would it be to have him removed? As cruel as that might sound, do you suspect that he in possession of any stolen property? <br>  <br>  Who do you have to talk to about this is there a relative or friend close by that might be able to offer some helpful suggestions? If for some reason you have become isolated, emotionally and socially, and if you feel the need to talk about this, you can email me, and I'll see what i can do to help.<br>  <br>  Bill|`|1UJ8LiyEaa	Hi. Perhaps you could try marriage counseling? Maybe he doesn't even know or care about how he is acting...but if someone else brings it to light and gives advice, it might help. I truly think in marriage you should try as hard as you can to make it, but...if things continue to get worse in the future, you should do what is best for you and your children.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Such is the nature of "love". It is fully a choice. 12 years ago you did not love this man - you did not know he existed. You found each other and in that - you "decided" to start loving him. It goes the other way also. Now, you've decided to not love him. <br>  What has marriage got to do with it? This is what I keep telling people all the time. Marriage has nothing to do with how much you love someone. It's a choice that we make daily to continue in relationship with another. Even on the days that you want to kill each other. You stay married because you said you would. "For better or worse......." - remember all that? It's not about love - it's about committment and the only way you can do that with another person is by FORGIVENESS! You two have lost the ability to forgive each other for your acts against each other. It matters not what he does - what are you going to do? This is not about him. It's all about your own value and perception of worth. <br>  Look at the Apostle Paul in the Bible. You can't tell, but he wrote almost all of his letters (Romans, Ephesians, Timothy, Galations, etc...) from prison and in horrible persecution. In the face of terrible pain and anguish he still exuded JOY! This is where most people cannot go. "How can I have joy in the face of trial?" This is what the Bible calls us into. James 1:2 - "have joy in the face of trial for trial brings you....." (look it up) <br>  You are the perfect study. A person that knows all about psychology and can't control their own life. (See people?) This is a very, very hard thing to do. <br>  Added to that, you have family-of-origin issues that just cloud the whole mess. You are educated but need a bit more. Hit the books and find out how to fix thyself.
e5df938f156d6be3bb105ddd037ebe44aa	You have one life. If you feel that you are unhappy, then move on. Try therapy first, to just sort out your feelings. It doesn't hurt. I am in the same situation also. Been married 17 years. Life is so short and we only have a limited amount of time to be happy and you cannot stay some place where are not. People grow apart. I wish you much luck.|`|0WHJhEXZaa	Hey Sis, there there.. I understand how you feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  As girls, I will tell you a secret - there's only one way you can win his heart totally and that is seducing him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you see "bitches" getting all the men they don't deserve to have or sometimes you see your guy is being seduced by another man.<br>  So to win him back, you have to learn to seduce him!<br>  <br>  Before I married my boyfriend he was constantly being wooed by many other women.  Some are prettier than me, I have to admit.  Some even have bigger "assets" than me.<br>  At one point, I nearly lost him but luckily I learn this seduction secrets.  It came very useful especially when I start to feel he and I are drifting apart.  Seduction bonds us closer again.  Because of this, we are happily married and everyday he loves me more than ever as if we JUST got into a relationship!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, we have to "cheat" by seducing to win our man, my dear sis.<br>  <br>  Here's the site that helped me on seducing my man back: <a href="http://xurl.jp/fcm" rel="nofollow">http://xurl.jp/fcm</a>|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Part of love and marriage is working through your differences.|`|HbTInfYCaa	salt and pepper are total opposites, but when you see one the other is usually right beside it.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No.  It might be time for you to take a weekend retreat away from each other.  And by weekend retreat, I mean somewhere quiet, somewhere in nature, designed for reflection.<br>  <br>  Men and women ARE different.  Marriage is hard because of it, especially when we get into constant conflict stages.  It seems easier to walk away than to stay put and work through it.  Plus, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence (but it really isn't).<br>  <br>  Assess your values' system and tell yourself what you think valid grounds for divorce should be.  If none of these are there in your marriage, it isn't over yet unless you throw in the towel.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	As my Gran used to say <br>  <br>  "A bird can marry a fish ...... but where are they going to live?"   I'm in same boat at the moment so know how you feel.   What about having a temp break say for 6 months, that way it takes the heat off and frees you of the stresses that stop you thinking clearly and you can still arrange to go out and start courting again - remember what brought you together in first place.  Good luck ;)|`|dFUqPcWKaa	If only one of you is willing to try to make it work, then probably.<br>  <br>  However, if you're both willing to work at it, then try marriage counseling.<br>  If you've already tried marriage counseling but didn't get the results you were looking for, try another doctor.<br>  Sometimes couples go through three or four different doctors before they get with the one that helps them best.|`|GegQJNzSaa	I was married for 20 years(together 28) to a man who was extremely different then me. We kept our own friends,went out to differ ant bars. He went out friday and I went out saturday. If it was a place were we had to go to gather,we stayed in different rooms.(we did not like how the other acted if we were drinking). I worked midnights,he worked days.I even had my own room at the other end of the house.(Quieter). We raised 3 daughters. They are all drug free,and not sluts. I am a grandma of 1 and she was 26 when she had him.my youngest is 19. They all work and enjoy their lives,they love me and their father more then anything! I am very happy with the decision me and my ex made,he is happy to. But now we are really happy we are on our own now! We get along great to this day and often take off on our Harleys for long weekend trips. (Neither of us has started dating)we have been divorced 4 1/2 years. I guess we got use to each other after all. I don't think we will ever get back together but it is great having a best friend of 28 years! You can work WITH your differences.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Sounds like a bad excuse to divorice.  You sure you're not interested in someone else and looking for an out?  Get counseling if you care at all for your husband.|`|djUMvICoaa	Depends upon what your differences are.  But what attracted you to each other in the first place if you are so different?
Whd6tqLzaa	Your story sounds just like the one in my life. Its just I am the wife, my husband is having a more than 3 year long affair with a married woman, mother of 4, we are separated and she is away from both her husband (who lives in his home country to take care of the children) and her lover (who is away to his home country for health reasons and can't come back to his country of residence because his wife will not take him back).<br>  <br>  Hope you can find some peace in your life, which will be hard because you're cheating on your husband and most probably you're the cause for the separation in other man's life. If he falls for another mistress, you can't blame him because he already proved that he is a cheater and cheated on his wife. Believe me, once a cheater is always a cheater.|`|9aeAvgBkaa	I'm a little confused....who promises to come back next year the lover or the husband? If it's the lover use this time to distance yourself from him and work on your relationship with your husband. If it's your husband is he working or in the military or did he leave you because he found out about the affair? With 3 kids and a husband comes a lot of responsibility...perhaps you fell into the affair because you felt unappreciated or not desired at home and the affair was the result because it was exciting and forbidden? Communicate with your husband as much as you can with the intention to find out what you all need to make things work and if you can afford it try marriage counseling.
fydj54JZaa	wow it sounds like you really love her<br>  <br>  the key to a girls heart is most definatly telling her how you feel, trust me this is the best way to win her over. tell her shes beautiful in ever single way. something about her smile, eyes, how she makes you feel when you see her, how she makes you laugh when you talk to her, how she gives you butterflys when you see her, and most of all, how much you love her and ache for her every second of the day. no matter what do NOT tell her "it hurts so much how you dont like me!" the worst thing to do is give her guilt and make her feel pressured into it. if you do this i 100% garuntee you will be together|`|PEcW4ysyaa	Sometimes pushy people are a real turn off to others, and you might just make her want to ignore you even more by chasing after her.

pVnUhYLQaa	You can't stop anyone from saying it. Well actually it sounds like you are stopping him, so I guess you can. Yeah tell him to chill. Or let him say it all he wants but don't say it back until you think you love him. Just say "I know" or "thank you" when he says it. If he wants to keep putting himself out there like that with out any reciprocation then that's on him.|`|707gOCvbaa	It's cute he ask your permission first but saying the love word is something you blurt out. I think he is very fond of you and really have no clear definition of love in his head. Just look him in the eye and say if in 2 months you feel the same way then you can tell me how many times you want.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	tell him you want to take it slow and see where it goes. He might already know you are the one for him but you need to figure that out. Just tell him you want to see where things go but you want to take them slow and if things go from there than your ok with it. I do believe it is to early to say I love you though. Most people don't say that for a while.|`|9298mlxoaa	A few days, it should take months for him to say it. You shouldn't ruch into things. You should wait several months.|`|jHyDO7rcaa	If you want it then let him say it and kiss him.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	U should actually be really creeped out by this and the fact that ur not and are asking if u should let him is weird!

q3FDAQ9Baa	put the cell phone down and let he rcontact you when she's ready to.<br>  <br>  sounds like she wanted to go to the concert though! :-)<br>  <br>  give her space.   It's like she's taking what she wants, but doesn't want to give in return.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I hope she does'nt reconsider getting back with you.You are very conrolling and obsessive and that only gets worse the longer you are with someone.Leave her alone,it's like you are stalking her and then asking us if it's ok.Get a life and start living yours alone.The need to control her tells me you are a very insecure person.Stop all comunication as ahe may turn these over to the authoities if they get worse as you will be stalking her.Move On|`|hokWD3Jjaa	Dude you are acting like a chick being to overpossesive wanting to spend time.  I understand you love her and everything but man you got to give her some breathing room also.  Have a guys night and relax for a few if you can't do that you are not going to fix it.  You know what happens when you can't breathe right?  You fight for air so you do whatever you can to get som air.  That is what she is doing getting some air.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	The biggest problem here is your jealousy. If you don't try to work on this or try to control your thoughts then you will lose her. She is probably so fed up with you right now and if you don't back off and give the space that she needs then you are going to ruin this relationship. Your jealousy has probably made it so difficult for her  that maybe now she needs space to evaluate your relationship with her. You need to give her the space that she needs. And if it takes her one week or three weeks then leave her alone. You should not get in touch with her until she gets back to you. And in the meantime you need to try to work on your jealousy. You need to trust this woman because if you don't them you lose everything. Do you want to push her out of your life? Then give her the space that she needs.|`|djUMvICoaa	Well, you answered your own question "over my stupidness".  If you have messed up in something so big where it was laid right out in front of you, give me space, and you couldn't abide by that how many other things have youi done that she may have ignored at the time but now when she really needed you to listen and you didn't those other things finally came into play, that you have been trying to control her.  For most people when that comes out they want away from you and fast.  Of course she is going to be cold during the concert and you showed your immaturity once again by trying to kiss her when she didn't want to.  You better back off and asssess your actions and motives, you are sending her the wrong messages.  The best thing you could do to understand this is email her a what did i do wrong question with a sorry attached and see if she answers.  And don't try to tell her why you did what you did if she does answer, that doesn't matter, only that she took offense to it.  Then you have to see if you can fix that and if you can then fix the relationship.|`|tGlnumvKaa	Leave her alone and let her decide when and if she wants to contact you. If you continue to harrass her, she will never give you another chance!<br>  <br>  If she doesn't come back, you'll know what not to do the next time. I've actually broken up with a couple of guys for pulling this crap. Jealousy is a wasted emotion. It serves no reason other than to make the person whose jealous feel superior.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	In my opinion, mentally healthy women do not ask for time and space when they are in love.<br>  <br>  Assuming she is truly suffering mentally right now, this is her attempt to deal with it on her own without the complications of dealing with your relationship with her.  Valid, btw.<br>  <br>  If you love her, give her this space and respect her wishes.  She wants to come to you whole.  Some of us just need to do it this way.  If you do not give her this space, and you "force" yourself on her, you will lose her.<br>  <br>  Men don't mean to be selfish, but they are.  Women sometimes have to push away to take care of what needs taking care of and believe it or not, when the woman is the one who needs taking care of, men really suck generally at this.<br>  <br>  Adding:  You have my respect for allowing yourself to be vulnerable enough to ask this question, btw.  <br>  <br>  I also want you to know I do not dislike men--I'm rearing a son.  I have an excellent father and I go to him for just about every kind of practical advice.  For things like this, however, I go to Mom (or he hands the phone to her lol).<br>  <br>  Send her an e-mail or text telling her you love her and are there when she wants or needs you.  Leave it there.  See what happens.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i wouldn't want to be around someone who's going to pout or make me feel like my presence is unwanted. ask her if she needs more time to herself. you don't want an angry girlfriend around you, what would be the point of that?<br>  <br>  however if you guys continue to separate yourselves from each other, how will the problem ever be solved? because when you come back together the problem is STILL there, just like when you guys went to the concert together because the problem was never spoken about. so i say just talk it over, get this annoying thing out of the way and resume to your relationship.
RDIGrQoKaa	On a more serious note...<br>  <br>  It sounds like whatever went down with her is something pretty serious. Be sure to let her cope with whatever it is shes dealing with right now. It may be hard but try and give her a little more space. Sometimes in dealing with grief, people need to learn how to get over their feelings themselves. <br>  <br>  It's very nice of you to try and help her feel better. And I know it must be killing you inside to know that there isn't anything you can do. Just take a step back with all the "touchy-feely", ask her if theres anything you can do for her personally. It sounds like there is still something there if she asked to go with you to the concert.<br>  <br>  This is something that can be fixed. Show her you care by doing little favors for her and maybe even taking her son out for a while so she can have some time to herself. I hope this helps.|`|vfJPCGcmaa	Just get into a horrible car wreck, then she'll feel bad and forgive you right away!|`|9Q07kREJaa	yu didn't give her enough time... wait a lil while|`|MRxm67DPaa	its maybe becuase she needed some attention and needed u to be there for her so now its wierd cuz she feels like u abanded her look giveing some 1 space isnt always a good idea becuase this can affect ur relationship with her so like u should have never given her space when she really wanted u to be there for her so look just try to make her feel special and like make her feel like old times so she can reamber all the good time u 2 had togeather|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Give her at least two weeks. Before you do, send her an email telling her how you feel, ie I love you, care for you, your son's awesome, etc.<br>  <br>  It sounds like two things.<br>  <br>  One: she really does need space to figure out a non- guy issue. Your not involved in it, and she doesn't want you to be involved. <br>  <br>  Two: she is trying to let you down easy, but feels bad about it. <br>  <br>  With either of these situations your best bet is to let her figure it out. Don't contact her for two weeks, let her contact you. Don't talk about your relationship or her problem. Be nice and fun when you can talk to her. Don't get mushy or jealous around her, because she will freak out. She doesn't want to deal with you and her problem at the same time. <br>  <br>  At the end of the two weeks call her and ask her about her problem and if you can help. Don't ask about the relationship just yet. <br>  If it's fixed and she wants to go on a date, then great no worries.<br>  If she breaks up with you, then I'm sorry but you did the best thing, because now in the future you can say you gave her space and wasn't an *** who probed her for information or made it worse. You will get all your things back and you can give her things back. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|AA11108018	The news she received really upset her.  You  should have let her go out blow some steam off and everything would be.  If you want to make sure she was ok you should have ask her either call  or text you when  got home so you could know she is ok|`|xcJwxyRRaa	You need to re-read your question and pick out the things she is trying to tell you and already told you she needs and wants from you.<br>  It's just stupid to you, not her or this wold not be happening .<br>  Jealousy is a form of fear, What are you fearing, that she'll leave you or actually have human contact with others all the while she, her kid, her family are liking you? What will you do when and if you get married to her? lock her in the house and never let her have a life, hobbys, jobs, career?. Time to trust, get real, face the truth of the way the world is and how it works and that people can have friends and go out and enjoy their lives and not be cheating and all that crap you see on DR Phil. <br>  She wants space and time to do what she wants to do when she wants to do it bc she feels she is not trusted or being treated like a real woman or human being it seems. <br>  when you try to control people they feel threatened and trapped and all they want to do is escape just as you would if you were in the same predicament, right?<br>  She needs space as she stated, so give it to her. It's hers to own. To feel free so she can be free for you, with you and her life, kid(s) and family and so on.  What is life without freedom?<br>  She doesn't want you to beg, whimper, cry, or be a girl about this . Be the man and give her what she wants and stop trying to control her and maybe she'll get over it soon.<br>  No gifts, flowers, or anything will do, but an I'm sorry goes a long way. <br>  If you want to give her a gift, give her the gift of missing you. Stay away for a time. No contact whatsoever. you'll see. Then let her come to you when it's time. she prob will in a day or two.
d0WQ2pZNaa	the best thing you can do for yourself, and for her. is to just not care about the rumors, you know what is true and what isn't and people who dont believe you dont deserve to be your friend.<br>  Tell these 'people' that you aren't that desperate to just get with a girl you dont even know just because she likes you.<br>  shes not the first girl to like you, and believe me she wont be the last.<br>  <br>  stay strong.|`|d1tyTq6Saa	u need to imagine that u r surrounded by a big bubble.

I did the same thing when i went to college. Yea my parents were mad as hell but they got over it and yours will too. If you killed your self you would miss out on a lot of things in your later years. God has a purpose for all of us. I dont know what yours is only you and God know. But tough it out man. What dont kill you only makes you stronger, in mind and body. Go talk to a minister about whats bothering you.  Life is like playing poker. You are delt a hand of cards, you can fold out(suicide), or make the best of it and play your hand out(live life). I m 32 yo and have 3 kids. If i would have killed myself when things were bad, I wouldn't be able to enjoy watching my kids grow up. Its really rewarding dude. I m not saying life aint hard because it is, but you are only making things worse. You have to grow up and learn how to be honest with those around you and most of all yourself, learn to deal with the everyday stress. I flunked out of college, went to work and worked very hard at what i do. Now I am working for a very sucessful oil company. Keep your head up man, just deal with things the best you can. When you cant deal with it anymore ask for some help. Ministers will keep things you all talk about between you and him/her. Surround your self with good people that you can relate to, and live your life. Hope i helped little dude! Set some small goals you can achieve very easily, then set higher goals you will find out that achieving these goals are very rewarding.

I don't think you need to shave his head and definitely not give him drugs.  You might regret it and the April fool joke's going to be on you and not in a positive way.  Think of something else. . . like polishing his fingernails and toenails bright red when he's sleep and/or putting makeup on him.

He will slap his face and the shaving or whipped cream will go all over him!<br>  <br>  2) While he is asleep, set his alarm clock for 2am or 3am and hide it in his room. Good places to hide it are: behind the closet or under the bed. It will go off and he will be scrambling around trying to find it. For even more fun, try taking out the light bulbs in all his lights so he wil be searching in total darkness.<br>  <br>  3) Change all the clocks in the house 2 hours ahead while he is sleeping. When he wakes up, he will think he is 2 hours late for work or school.<br>  <br>  4) Go out and buy a packet of inexpensive hair extensions about the same colour as his hair. Cut them to about the same length as his hair and put them somewhere he will find them when he wakes up. Watch in laughter as he thinks something happened to his hair while he was asleep.<br>  <br>  5) While he is asleep, place his hand in a bowl of lukewarm water.

Tell him calmly and say how you feel about this. Ask him him if he still has feelings for her or not. It is gets out of hand then give him space and time to think.<br>  <br>  I don't think he's cheating on you but i feel there's some things between them is unresolved and did not have a proper break up or closure. <br>  <br>  If nothing happens between a month or two, break up with him as you're not getting the answer you want or benefitting from the relationship you have with him.|`|5ia2JbrNaa	im really sorry, but it sounds like he is :/<br>  or hes reallyyyyyyyyy good friends with her, but if she drives 14 miles just to see him and then spends the whole day in his room.. it sounds like cheating.. hmm.. maybe you could try reading the texts from her without him knowing? if he is cheating, dont give him a second chance.. blow him out and never talk to him again..<br>  <br>  hope this helps xxx|`|CR7arBmbaa	Yeah sweety.

5GslKD4baa	Well it all depends on what your friends answered him, if they said he shouldn't ask you out, because you didn't like him, then he'll act like it was a joke, and it'll be hard for him to admit that it wasn't, once he have said it.

dIS08i1oaa	Setting a diamond is a simple and inexpensive process.  It takes about 15 minutes and the labor cost should be about $35.<br>  <br>  Here is the best way to get your diamond set:<br>  <br>  Find a local jeweler or a jewelry repair shop.  Before you go, make sure that the shop has a bench jeweler on the premises and that he will be available when you arrive.<br>  <br>  If your engagement ring has a blank "head" on it, and it is made to fit your loose diamond it will be very easy.  The jeweler can determine this when he examines your ring.   If it is not a fit, then you may have to pay for the metal cost of a new head (about $40).<br>  <br>  The bench jeweler slides your diamond into position, then uses a torch to heat the tips of the head to melting point.  The melting point of gold is relatively low, and the heat will not hurt your diamond.  The jeweler uses a special "cupping" tool to form the hot gold into nice round beads, and these are the prongs that hold your diamond in place.  The beads can remain rounded, but today most prongs are slightly flattened at the top to avoid snagging on a piece of clothing.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips that will help you get the most value for your money:<br>  <br>  1.  Don't let a jewelry store send your diamond and engagement ring mounting off the premises.  Even an honest jeweler could make a mistake and switch your diamond by accident.  So make sure they do it on the premises while you wait.<br>  <br>  2.  When your ring is finished, examine the quality of their work before you leave the store.  The prongs should be uniform, perfectly round and about four times the diameter of the tip of a ball point pen.  If they are large and off shape, have them fixed on the spot.  If they are too small, the diamond won't be held securely and you could loose it.<br>  <br>  3.  Check to be sure that the diamond is secure in your engagement ring setting before leaving the store.  First, use your fingers, tighten your grip on the diamond girdle and try to twist it.  Also, use a pair of jewelers tweezers and do the same test.  If the diamond moves, even slightly, then they need to reset it.  A diamond that is not absolutely tight in its setting will eventually fall out.<br>  <br>  I've listed a page below where you can view the size and look of good prong setting:|`|nujen4dmaa	You have many choices when setting a lose diamond.  You can choose a custom setting which comes from a cast or you can custom make a setting which is usually done by hand. You also have a few mainstream choices of metals.  Yellow gold, 14 or 18k White Gold, Platinum,(more $$$).There is also Palladium which is 95% pure and is a part of the platinum group.  Its not as heavy as platinum.<br>  <br>  Here are a few examples of simple settings.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/3407789?pg=embed&sec=" rel="nofollow">http://vimeo.com/3407789?pg=embed&sec=</a><br>  <a href="http://www.whiteflash.com/Engagement-Rings/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.whiteflash.com/Engagement-Rin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.jamesallen.com/engagement-rings/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamesallen.com/engagement-rin...</a><br>  <br>  The idea is, you would leave your diamond with the jeweler you have chosen to do the setting.  <br>  <br>  Setting is generally safe or a diamond.   But it is VERY important  that both you and your jeweler go over the diamond thoroughly, preferably with a jewelers loupe.  Both you and he need to be aware and agree on any existing "faults" within the diamond.  This covers the jeweler so he won't be responsible if damage does occur due to any old clarity faults. <br>  <br>  You also need to agree on who is responsible for damage that could be done that doesn't involve old clarity faults.  For example if a diamond has an extremely or very thin girdle the jeweler needs to take extra care during the setting stage as to not chip the stone. <br>  <br>  Once you have agreed on all the terms and conditions, the jeweler needs to give you a receipt stating the certification, color, size, clarity, etc of the diamond.  Everything else you agreed on should also be stated CLEARLY on this receipt. ie the expected time to completion of the setting, an agreed deposit amount and who pays for damage on the stone during setting..  NEVER expect to pay in full up front!  I would hesitate to use any jeweler who ask for full payment upfront.<br>  <br>  It may be worthwhile if not already appraised and insured, to have this carried out on the diamond before you commit to setting the stone.<br>  <br>  IdealD|`|AA10928125	I've watched them do one diamond and they just dropped it in and then carefully bend the tings(sp)around the stone to hold it in...make sure you know your diamond(recognize  it) before you leave it. The could exchange your diamond for a fake stone. who knows?|`|lvOR401haa	I guess it would depend on the setting you want as to HOW it is done.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of different settings available out there, so I would have a look at some jewelry sites and get a feel for what you want yourself for the stone you have.  <br>  <br>  The cost will depend on the metal; white gold is a lot less than platinum for instance.  But the type of setting will impact on the cost.<br>  <br>  I've copied a few websites below for you.  Have a good look at the 'settings' available - they include bezel, claw and tension - and all give a different look.  It'll also help to show these with the shape stone you have too.<br>  <br>  The first describes different settings for you, and the next two are online ring stores (cater for both US and UK etc depending where you are).  These stores sell settings separately from stones, so you can get an idea of the cost of the band alone.  You could buy from these if you know someone who can set the stone for you.  Or, take a pic to your local jeweler and ask them to replicate what you want.  The last site helps you get an idea of the way it'll look set for it's size (it let's you select the size stone and gives an idea of how this looks in the various settings).|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	The price will vary on the type of band you get. Is it going to just be a plain band? What type of metal? You will only know the answers to these prices when you ask the jeweler. They will melt the metals and put them into a cast, then they set the diamond in with tiny tools and much precision.|`|yz2MKjTSaa	just bring it up to your local jewler shop and they will be BOUND to fix it! and im not sure the price. it varys in many shops.

WzKrZoHQaa	With the history of violence I'm surprised  CAFCASS allowed him access without it being supervised access.  They cannot force your children to see their father at all.  The girls will be interviewed anyway as their opinions will count regardless.  Don't try interviewing the children yourself there are specially trained Counsellors who do that in a very nice way - just like as if they were having a girlie chat really.  As the Police are involved then you will need to be guided by them now.  I wish you all well. <br>  <br>  Try this tel number (Monday) as they have a special dept.

Most courts will allow this as a safety precaution.|`|djUMvICoaa	If he did touch your daughter in any sexual manner, he's looking at jail time in the least.  After that if the courts allow him visitation, it should be supervised visitation where the courts appoint someone to be in the same area with them to watch for anything that shouldn't be going on.  And they will probably cut back on his visitation periods too.  Or the courts could have him tested and find that he should have no contact with minors of any kind.  Make sure the charges are pressed against him and have your girls seen by a professional, they will need the help.|`|AA11280073	Why did you allow your children to have visitations with a man who had physically abused you?

Once the girls told you what he did to them, it was yes, your place to do all you could to keep this monster away from them.    <br>  <br>  Reassure the kids that supervised visitation is the best and safest for them all.    When the visits are supervised, he won't get away with him touching them or hitting them.<br>  <br>  If there are allegations of him doing these things to the girls, you have the right to have it investigated until anything is founded.

JxlaxOJTaa	I am so sorry to hear that. I know it's really hard to move on if you love that person dearly. You were so nice, but still this thing had happen to you. I too just recently broken and lost  the person I love the most. He promised me many things. I trusted him so much and believe that he will be there waiting for me till i'm ready. He asked for marriage and he had hoped that were going to be together someday. I know he loved me so much, that i became so unaware of loosing him. He moved to a different state and then things became ugly. I became so annoyed of his clingy. We didn't talk for 3months. Recently I found out his parents want him to get married and they fill fix it for him. I called him then he was in burst and broke up with me. He blame me for everything! He said he will love me forever, but his tired of fighting, and that we are two different people. I beg him like hell to come back, but he said he can only be a friend now. At first, I could not believe it, I know he was crazy about me, and he love me so much coz he showed it in many ways when were together for 3years. No one can over power his love he gave me. I trusted him so much, but in the end he changed!<br>  I cried a lot for weeks, and could not think of anything. I thought it was the end of the world. I couldn't eat, then I lost weight. I remember everything we did together. I see mysefl growing old with him. I want to be with him. I had hope he will forgive me and ask me back. Instead I was the one asking to give it another chance, and asked him to come back. He said we can only be friends now. We still talk, he contacted me when he went back to his country. I know he still love me, but he had moved on. I realized his not meant for me. <br>  If a guy tuely love you, he will make the move to fix every miss understanding. He won't waste any second to past by of not asking you to come back to his life. It's hard to forget a person when you love him dearly. But do understand that he is only human(his dynamic). Long distance relationship can messed up everything. Learn from your experience. I don't want to say that his probably with someone new, but it sounds more like it. If I were you I will give his space, and don't bother to ask him back. You can never force someone to love you if they don't feel it for you anymore. Be thankful for what had happen because now you know how weak he can be. Talk to your friends about it, let all the sorrow out. Cry to your mom-I did even if she don't know about our relationship until we broke up. Talk to your friend every time you feel the agonize. This Q&A helped me a lot. <br>  <br>  "What's meant to be will find its way!" Make yourself busy on the healing process. If he realized someday that he needed you in his life then let him back. But don't waste your time waiting!<br>  <br>  "Time heal a broken heart" You can never speed things up to forget him. Why would you want to forget him anyway if you love him. Just keep praying to help you to get through it. I love my EX and I will love him forever, even though we are not together anymore- that's True Love. <br>  <br>  "Everything happens for a reason!" Keep praying to lead you in the right way. Sometimes things can get ugly, but think of the bright side. Maybe there's someone out there who deserve you better. God had planned everything. He don't want you to feel the pain, but he probably want you to learn from it.<br>  <br>  This is what I believe in now after my broken heart:<br>  <br>  "LIFE is too short to be UNHAPPY,be CONTENTED of what u got,don't be SELFISH,APOLOGIZE when u shud,take CHANCES,GIVE everything,LEARN from ur MISTAKES,but NEVER regret,let go of what u CAN'T change,people CHANGE,thing's go WRONG, but``LIFE GOES ON"<br>  <br>  "Life goes on!"....what done is done... you are not the only one who had been in that situation. I'm still in the healing process. Stop listening to sad songs, sad movies, and put away all the things that will remind you of him. You will waste you're time if you sit and think about him all the time. Anyhow he will not know what you've been going through and he will never appreciate it coz his done with your relationship. <br>  <br>  He change his phone number,he want his space...indication that you need to pick yourself up and moved on. Promises are made to be broken.People Change!<br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to...just shoot me an email. I been there and hope to help others in same situation.|`|Ism92isCaa	He simply probably realized things were becoming too 'close' or too' intimate' for his liking and decided he wasnt' ready to commit to you. He knew it would probably 'break ' you , so he changed his number. That tells me he wants to cut all ties with you and that you should move on. I know it will take some time for you to heal, but it is better this way, because you DON'T want someone who DOESN'T want you. I n the meantime, occupy yourself with other things:  your favorite pasttimes (before you met him), find new friends, go to a park, etc.|`|9HCA1sdlaa	Ya know......ur never really 100% who ur with is ur soulmate. Things just go really good or they don't. Usually, at the start of all relationships, its wonderflful. Kind of like a pack of dogs, after a certain period of time relationships have to be rebuilt...especially 9 months. U will encounter a lot of people in ur life. If he isn't it then he isn't. U only live once...go to his place and plead how much u love him. If the sea is his life, offer to go with him. U won't get pregnant out there u don't have to worry. I can understand as a woman being unable to bear a child may feel demeaning, but it is what it is right? Don't worry about anything other than what you can do. Empires have been built, and toppled, hearts have been broken and the universe continues. Your purpose is relative to your environment and based upon whatever you want it to be. There is so many wonderful things out there. A sea voyage may be fun. And you 2 on a boat...a great time to bond. Show him ur in it 110%|`|omalHCZ1aa	I hate to say this, but I think you just got dumped. The best thing to do right now is stop talking to him completely.

sauE94zVaa	Kissing is a beautiful thing. It allows you to get too close to the person you love and taste them. In a weird way, I also believe it tells if a guy cares about you or not. I've dated a few guys (I'm guessing I'm older than you, I'm a university student), some of these guys just wanted sex from me and others really cared about me. When I look back at it, from the way we kissed, the ones that wanted sex would start off tongue-kissing me so hard and wild like they want to eat me up (and feel my boobs right after!) but the ones that really liked me would take it slow and gentle, do it sensually in the most amazing way ever. We kissed like we're not in a hurry, like we have all the time in the world to do whatever but at this moment all what we wanted to do is have our lips touching each other's before it goes a little wild and crazy (tongue and a little gentle nibbling on the lower lip and everything) and when it gets to this stage it never feels uncomfortable if you paved the way for it by being gentle and sensual at first. Just enjoy your guy and be relaxed, this positive energy will be passed into him and neither of you will be nervous.<br>  <br>  I personally believe all the tips that go like (move your tongue in circles or like this and that) are completely useless and they just kill the fun. I personally find guys that start doing this bit unattractive. I'd rather have someone REAL that kisses me the way he wants to not by some kind of manual.|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	the luv u hav with eachother <br>  is how well it will go<br>  its natural<br>  it will just come<br>  there is no tips for it|`|877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	Well there are lots of techniques out there. Like, vary your pace: fast, slow, rough, gentle, etc. Also, run your tongue along his lips. Suck on his lips. Suck on an ice cube before giving him the tongue, etc etc.<br>  <br>  But the truth of the matter is, and I speak from experience, the thing that makes a kiss the most enjoyable and passionate is NOT technique and it never will be. <br>  <br>  Rather, it's emotion. How you feel towards the person. If you're crazy about this person and relaxed while kissing (not worrying about anyone walking in, etc.), then YOU will be into the kiss! And so will they.<br>  <br>  And that's what makes kissing so enjoyable - When you're both into and enjoying it because you genuinely like/love each other.|`|FFQeMfFlaa	It really helps if it is with someone u like.<br>  dont try to stick ur tounge down his throat. give him some space..|`|tV1D6pIIaa	lean in to it more|`|1a61d1f4b2e04686142a2290e726268faa	caressing helps too|`|oB1WQJHgaa	ya. don't do it!!! :)|`|29FVvQVCaa	well if its his first time, do NOT shove your tongue down his throat...<br>  that will scare him...<br>  I know it scared me...<br>  lol...|`|giFaS1qDaa	juss go for it he won't judge it's his first :)<br>  what makes it super special is love

All along try to identify what this guy likes or what he would want in his wife to be. But never try to do anything silly to please him especially if he is a guy who will want to bed with a girl before he decides to marry or not.<br>  <br>  Simple just know what attributes your guy will like and see how you fare in them. Sometimes if it happens that you are to choose someone else as your partner in life don't worry you would have learned from this guy what men like in their wives. Many attributes of preference remain common for all men and its worth looking for a what a man who you would love to marry likes.<br>  <br>  After you know you possess most of what he would prefer ask him if you are to propose him what would he do? And what he would wish you had. He is your friend so what's wrong is asking the man himself.  Don't worry if he dumps you in a haste in that case he never deserved you.<br>  <br>  Well you have said you are attracted towards him and you both look a good couple. Many guys simply hide their attraction towards us but when they are serious about the relationship, they will approach. Don't worry if he is playing now as though hating and all. He may have already known that you are looking for him. Just be patient you will catch hold of him when he is most vulnerable.

gCPu04gTaa	What was the question?<br>  Anyway I think it depends on what type of film you like. If you really get into a chick flick then its going to seem more suspenseful, than an action film that has the same story line and action sequences as the dozen other action films you've seen this year.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	...|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Some "action" flicks are lame, and so are a lot of "chick" flicks.  If you are a dude and you find the emotional, touchy-feely stuff of chick flicks suspenseful, you are probably gay or abnormally sensitive.|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I think that both types of movies are suspenseful, but in different ways, are brains process each type of movie in a different way..|`|lHynYc4Aaa	Nobody can resist a chick flick!|`|6JPiNGdfaa	agreed|`|gxuMbZzdaa	It's not that they are more suspenseful, persay. It's just a different kind of suspense that you are not used to. It's new and shiny. Instead of will that blow up, or is he really gunna stab him before he shoots that one guy? it's is she really gonna be with him instead of her husband or will they ever get together in this movie, or will they kiss already!<br>  <br>  I'm not against chick flicks. One of my all time favorite movies is Love Actually.|`|577bdc9bba2dab3444db1e5a6a5f48bcaa	or you're gay and just finding out!!?|`|T33Za7jiaa	Most likely.<br>  Love and sex sells.
ls8KNu9uaa	Children are like sponges. They absorb just about anything. And every 'thing' people do, always has a psychological background behind it.<br>  <br>  We may not see any overt symptoms or changes, but surely, it has affected that person. Even if that person may have remembered or forgotten what happened, it is already engraved in their subconscious mind. So say this person has his way of reacting to problems, challenges, or any situation, it may have been due to that event that he was molested. <br>  <br>  Different people, have different ways of taking up things.<br>  <br>  By the way, if that person have repressed it or have unconsciously forggoten about it, then it must have really been some trauma.|`|rpwjkuvmaa	I've heard of people pushing it out of their mind..<br>  I'm not sure. Something like that causes trauma in your mind so i think it would always affect the person it's happened to, however the effects can be very diverse from emotional eating to panic attacks. The person in question might not have any idea that these things are actually linked to when they were molested.|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Yes this could happen; your body blocked it out rather than deal with it; now it has popped up;if it is causing you a problem seek help.Councillors are available for that type of thing.There are phone help lines that can help you or point you in the right direction to get the assistance you need to deal with this.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	YeS!! It happened to me and anything from a noise to a smell can bring it back. Its a sad thing, especially for the people who love them and had no idea of it ever happened. Im in counseling now, 35 years after the fact and struggle with the stuff all the time. Good luck to you hun|`|8pl3ShtBaa	Yes. There are triggers for people like that. They could not be triggered for most of their younger years but as the brain develops they could all of the sudden be shocked by a memory of a traumatic experience.
14tr16uuaa	The best you can do for your cousin is be supportive of her. And that means having to 'put your foot down'. If she wants you to cover for her you say no, she wants to go out and party with you, you say no!<br>  <br>  IF she is getting a beating from her parents, I wouldn't hesitate to let her just spend the night once in while (but don't make it a permanent deal)<br>  <br>  Your cousin is a good person I am sure, but with some people they just have to hit rock bottom before they can get on with their lives. It's sad, but true.<br>  <br>  Your doing the best you can, and I know its hard. The only thing I would try is maybe find some people who took that life path, like a support group for kids with troubled pasts. Bring her to the meeting and show her where her life is headed! She may respond to that.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped. Good Luck!|`|Qbjpft5aaa	wow. lol. thats long. maybe you should do something to get it through her head. maybe next time she needs bailed out of jail, send her parents<br>  to pick her up after she called you.. or next time she wants you to <br>  "cover" for her. just dont. she NEEDS to get it through her head that her <br>  actions have consequences. and if she doesnt learn that soon, then<br>  she'll be even worse her whole life.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	all i can say is talk to her parents about it, because they are ones in control of her. maybe you should give them advice about punishing her the right way. you probably have the ability of being more observant then they can, so tell them. but the moment she turns 18 i would kick her out of the house, if she can't get the message then maybe she should just stay out and learn from her mistakes herself.|`|tSI3GFepaa	im sorry but i dont think that you can do anything<br>  it seems that she wont listen to anyone
AA11447210	No, someone answering another person's phone doesn't necessarily mean they are cheating. However, if someone is cheating and they allow another person to answer their phone, or their lover answers it on their own, that's pretty stupid and a good way to cause suspicion or the indiscretion to be revealed. Cheating is stupid anyway, but why increase the chances of getting caught, if you're going to do it?|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I doubt people get divorced over these kinds of misunderstandings.  The ones I know about usually become favorite family jokes, because the man is a family member or friend, the child asks for mother and there are two mothers in the home at the time or some such.<br>  <br>  Cheating generally involves much more than this for evidence and sometimes, this might be the only physical evidence a person can get their hands on, but they "know" cheating is occurring.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Well, I agree that its not always cheating. But if I'm calling my wife's phone and a male voice answers it. The very next question after he answers, would be: who are you? Where is my wife? Depending on what he says, will go along way with me on the subject of cheating.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You cannot make assumptions like that. You would think that if they were really cheating they would be smart enough to not answer the phone.|`|zTQVC7GBaa	sorry i dont understand|`|0bYcYz2jaa	There is a very slim chance that she is at a spa, or taking part in a sleep study, or some other totally innocent scenario but the chances are, like I said, slim.  It is a very bad sign and steps should be taken to find out the truth before any decisions are made.  Everyone deserves a chance to explain, but decisions have to be made with reason and thought.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Honestly, it sounds very suspicious to me!
n1LWkT0paa	Its supossed to hurt only as he first breaks the hymen. if she was "wet" enough, then it shouldnt have hurt that much. She was probably nervous so she wasnt getting aroused enough. They should work on thier forplay so that it wont hurt for her.|`|qbvjOFvHaa	holy **** tell her not do do it at all. pregnancy will probably happen|`|4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	First and most importantly she needs to decide if she really wants to do it and is not just feeling pressured from him because she thinks the relationship may end if she doesn't. If she decides she really wants to go through with it, then she needs to tell him he needs to be gentle. If she is not comfortable telling him what to do sexually, then she's not mature enough to do it.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	Mhh well first of all, I don't think it is that important to have sex, any way, and well when you have sex with the person you love it shouldn't be a rush, but anyway tell her to stop thinking about it and go to school that is more important nowadays|`|HbZ9assfaa	uh let's c <br>  basketball player, 19 years , and d*** verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry big<br>  wish i was her but tell her to try "k.y" it's a magic

She's spending her free time with you and you said she's busy!<br>  But please take my advice: kiss her *sweetly* don't try to do anything sexual even if you are on her bed. you'll both regret it.<br>  If you both like each other, make it for sure, but than take it slow!|`|0wyxSUvMaa	It Sounds like she does she probably already has the impression that you like her to if you do then ask her to go on a date or something its not like shes going to hit you(:|`|R054TqdWaa	Take my advice and kiss her..<br>  Next time ye're play fighting, stop it and just go for it, it seems cleaar that ye both want it..=]|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I think she likes you.|`|qbbNtGVcaa	i think she likes you! :) and you like her. im not sure if it would be a good idea to ask her out or go out with her..she seems fun but going out could also ruin your friendship. now you two would feel like you HAVE to do that stuff...not let it come naturally like it is now. so maybe you two should just be best friends that both like each otherr. :) good luck! have fun!|`|DybOqfGpaa	she likes u
C7DyQ7Pgaa	slow passionate is always better the sensations are hightened.<br>  you may have to teach them.|`|8SndaHUMaa	Hammering or beating of penis with vagina during intercourse give feeling of presence of penis in vagina though rough pounding strokes piercing on vagina, sometimes cause pain, but gives great satisfaction.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	Passionate sensual sex.  Nice slow and gentle is the way to go. Sometimes a little fast but never rough. That like I really don't like you just want to get my rocks off.|`|QVj2JwWKaa	Love both!<br>  Passionate and sensual and the hot heavy give it to me now pound away sex.|`|zAux7vzPaa	yup..it depends..if its casual..while hanging out..sensual is something 2 do..but if u r in private nd moody..den its bang on..|`|CQsD09D6aa	Passionate sensual|`|th7C1aoaaa	Both have their right time and place. I like sex, period.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	It depends.  If we have been just kinda hanging out together that day, and spending time together, then I like soft and sensual.  If we have been fighting all day, then the rougher the better.  Make up sex is best when it's a little rough. LOL  And, if I can't make up my mind what I want, then I just get on top, that way I can control what's happening and I get it however I want it.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Passionate sensual|`|3iNobwVraa	Depends.  On the day, on the scenery, on the mood.  And, I do things that aren't necessarily my favorite, for him, because it's fun to see him go under.  A good sex life has to be reciprocal in the sense that both are committed to the other's enjoyment.<br>  <br>  Note:  This DOES NOT mean anyone should ever do something they don't want to do.  I'm just suggesting that maybe, sometimes, the 'not wanting to' could be a tad selfish.  If it truly is something one doesn't want to do, by golly, don't!  We all have our 'no fly zones,' and a respectful partner would understand.|`|AA11447210	Both...depends on the mood. I don't want it the same way all the time, that would get too routine. There's a time for 'lovemaking' and a time for animalistic 'phuquing'...and all kinds of variations in between. ??? That's what makes a good sex life (for me).|`|aXYiOskmaa	i don't like the same thing all the time. sometimes it should be sensual and other times a bit rougher. not the degrading pounding stuff though.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I like both. Sometimes you just want to be primal.
4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	I was in two cotillions myself. Make sure you definitely practice the waltz and learn how to sit in a hoop skirt, lol!!

4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	Firstly, you are too young to drink and should not be using weed. If you don't know how initiate sex with a woman then you are too young to do it.

Try to get it to be just you and here.  If your really want more people around and she brings a girl with her, find a friend and see if he would be interested in double dating with her friend...  But just hang out with her by yourself, and see what happens.  You may not want to see her again after the night or may never want her to leave...just gotta see|`|RBpa5v1uaa	Being a lone would be a lot better. Just talk to her. Don't talk like a child, be mature... I hung out with this girl I really like a lot. But I didn't think she liked me. She knew I liked her and finally I just was talking to her and it was 2:22 and she said, make a wish. I was like wut? and she said, It's 2:22 now make a wish... I said, Okay? and closed my eyes and made a wish. We then looked at each other and just kissed.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	well if she's the kinda girl that likes liquor and weed, i say bring it! it helps me loosen up when in a weird situation. just act casual and be yourself. feel comfortable and get movies or something. shower right before she gets over, make yourself smell extra good (: but be careful and dont let her use you. girls can be players to ya know. <br>  good luck!|`|PtDQ46Tjaa	Just be yourself<br>  <br>  How do you know shes more experience than you? don't say that unless you know for sure.|`|6VJ1etR4aa	life isnt about hooking up with girls and smoking weed.|`|xWAVSpFBaa	Wow... your thought process cracks me up.

701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	I used to own a bridal show and coordinated and decorated many weddings.  Here are some ideas that are wonderful and inexpensive.<br>  <br>  Keep the bridal party small.  No more than 2 attendants.  Ask them to pay for their dresses and shoes.  Keep the dress simple, one color and don't get taffeta.  It wrinkles when you just look at it.  If you insist on paying for their dresses, see if there is a seamstress in your family that can donate her time to making the dresses for you.  Get a satin shoe (preferably a pump) with a 1 1/2 inch heel and have them died to match the fabric.  Simple earrings will do the trick and can also double as their gift at the rehearsal supper.  Keep their bouquets simple.  You don't want to dress up the girls real fancy.  That is for you.<br>  <br>  Have just a few candelabras on the alter with the one with 3 candles.  You make up the ribbons and flowers for them yourself.  The trick to saving money is to do most or all of this yourself.  You don't need fresh flower, you can make all these up with satin flowers and they will be just as beautiful.  You can make everything up early and not have to worry about them dieing.  You can even make a party with the girls and your mother/sisters/aunts/etc. to get all this together as well as making the bags with bird seed.<br>  <br>  Get a few candelabras to go down the isle and you decorate them just like you did the ones on the alter.<br>  <br>  For the reception:  Don't do a sit down meal.  Just have the two cakes, some nuts, mints, finger sandwiches, fruit and vegetable trays on the tables.  Have punch made from white grape juice and ginger-ale.  If you are getting married at a church, they should have the table cloths for the reception.  You can decorate the tables there yourself.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the ability to do the flowers yourself, see if there is a family member that can do them for you as their gift to you. You purchase what is needed and go from there.<br>  <br>  Here are some beautiful color ideas.<br>  <br>  Deep purple, gold, ivory<br>  Red, mauve, ivory and gold<br>  Teal, mauve and silver, white<br>  Orange, brown and gold, ivory<br>  Blue, yellow, silver, white<br>  <br>  The silver and gold are beautiful when it is sprinkled on the flowers and there are some ribbons in the metallic at the reception.<br>  <br>  Get a binder together with dividers and start making notes.  Keep that near you at all times.  You will get ideas at the most in-opportune time and it will help to jot them down.<br>  <br>  With help from family members or friends, you can do just about all this yourself and save a ton of money.  Even with the cakes.  If there is someone in your family that does these, go to them.  You will probably have to pay for the ingredients, but the cost will be so much less and you will have what you want and it will be perfect.<br>  <br>  Here is an idea.  If you are having a wedding in a garden, all that you might want would be an arch.  No candelabras.  That will save some money too.|`|a8uM21jyaa	How about a bollywood theme where everyone has to wear asian clothing such as sarees and such. Mmmm yh probably not gonna work. Erm what about making guests wear a certain colour?|`|OADjlP2caa	How about a beauty and the beast theme?<br>  <br>  That would be cute|`|G1boIrFuaa	Do you know what season your wedding will be in?  That can help spark ideas for people.  For example, you wouldn't want to do lime green and fuchsia colors in November.<br>  <br>  I'm getting married this October, and our theme is apples.  We'll have bowls of them for centerpieces, and everything is red or gold colored.  We're even spray painting some apples gold.  I'm gonna make a couple of these for the entrance to the reception:<br>  <a href="http://zofiadesign.com/images/Topiary%20red%20apple%20in%20trophy%20vase%2010-06.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://zofiadesign.com/images/Topiary%20...</a><br>  <br>  The main thing is, pick something that you really love, because by the time you're done planning the whole thing, you'll have seen a lot of it!
LS8LcuRaaa	He likes you, but he has a gf and he doesn't want to be with you. Maybe he doesn't know what to text you, maybe he feels uncomfortable and that's why he didn't text you back. You shouldn't be worried about anything, cause there is nothing to worry. You're his friend and that's it.|`|SxqYguUCaa	Maybe he just doesn't want to talk to you at the moment.

Don't worry, guys are usually like that.|`|SxqYguUCaa	The basic answer is, they want to look cool.<br>  They don't want to look weak, vulnerable, or not macho in any way.<br>  <br>  If he annoys you, tell him to stop.

Though the legal age may be 18, it is not wise for the young to become infatuated and do commit rashly.<br>  <br>  But, as in all things -- rashly it probably shall be.|`|fF1WbPltaa	It is possible but it probably wont last. In 5 years time she will be a different person with different and adult views.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	It's possible, I guess.

However, when someone is 15 years old, feelings can be fleeting transitory things that are heightened because of chemistry in the blood ....body changes and a combination of naivety, innocence and a lack of history on which to fall back on and understand these things.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend is 25 years young that me. And this could, for ARGUMENT SAKE mean, that she was 1 year old when I was 26 years old.  And now she is in her 30's ....Do you see what I mean?<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|vZdiZzBYaa	I would have to say no because that is the exact age difference between me and my brother. I am 15 and he is 20.

The only concern is that u are 15 and he is 20 so u are still at school whilst he is discovering himself at university. u two are at two different stages in ur lives so it can br very hard/tricky. <br>  <br>  if u are 22 and him 27 it would be better. understand? good luck.|`|E4W6KxCMaa	Sorry, but why is a creepy 20 yr old going for such young girls.<br>  That's gross. wait til you are older to date a 20 yr old or you will assure his fate as a sex offender. (It is a crime on his part to do anything sexual with you until you are 18)|`|xK75gTz9aa	nope thats illegal! . Your parents wouldn't want that to happen either. Wait till your like older like about 20 then it is possible.|`|jHyDO7rcaa	I wish it would be legal.

He sounds like a pedo.|`|OXohgDoJaa	Yes, but it's illegal.|`|6JPiNGdfaa	why not|`|2eztcCO0aa	No.  There's something wrong with a 20-year-old man who wants to get with a 15-year-old girl.  It's okay to be attracted to her, but if he's mature and has his head on straight, he'll realize it can't work.  He should wait until she's 18 before he tries to start a relationship.<br>  <br>  Also, if he has sex with this girl, he'll be committing a crime.  He could be prosecuted, sent to prison and labeled a sex offender for life.  If he has any sense, he'll stay far away from her until she's grown.|`|olw7Hlqaaa	When i was 14 i started seeing a friend of the family who was 24. I thought i knew everything, thought i loved him blah blah. I seen him for two years and everything was great. After two years i moved on.<br>  However, im now just turned 30, and looking back, the situation was wrong. He was wrong doing what he done. He should have known better, and yes it was against the law. I have two girls of my own now, and one is nearly 10, to think that in 4years, she could be seeing someone much older than her scares me half to death. I know you will think you know best, but whatever you do, just be careful - in all ways.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Yes, but anything past friendship is illegal more than likely. Without any other information, it sounds like a 20 year old is using a 15 year old for sex (which i mentioned earlier, is illegal) or a 15 year old girl has a crush on a 20 year old and is doing what 15 year old girls with crushes to best. This sounds so odd that anyone is asking this question. I'm sorry to tell you this, but in this day and age, anything beyond friendship is doomed not only to fail, but to make the 15 year old cry for days on end.|`|YdwLS5VTaa	There are different types of love. I think your friend is confusing romantic love with friendship love. So the answer to your question is, No! Because real love has boundaries. Love is more that a feeling. Ask people who have been in romantic love a long time. Of course you can feel admiration for anyone older that good for friendship love but it's not romantic Love.|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	i guess its possible.......but it sure as hell isnt right...15 year olds and 20 year olds think very different<br>  and in my opinion if a 20 year old man had sex with a fifteen year old girl that in my opinion would make him a paedophile<br>  and all twenty year old guys want is sex!!|`|kLK2peV1aa	no age limit. i think that's kind of morally disgusting, but whatever.  And some guys have a way of conning you into a loving relationship for sex, and you're fifteen, virgin and if not virgin, tight, meaning it'll be satisfying to him.  Be careful.|`|o5SHzFujaa	well it is possible age is only a number. the downside is that its illegal. if he does anything even slightly fishie and people find out, he could go to the slammer. id wait 3 years until youre 18 then see if hes right for you.|`|C7KzBGlDaa	Yes its possible. Anything is possible.<br>  I was young once, and in love with a<br>  much older man. I was head over heels.<br>  however, when i grew up, I question<br>  myself now what he really wanted with<br>  someone so young.. ?|`|8tLS1XDWaa	Yes, its possible, but I also think the girl should wait till she's 18 and legal before she makes any serious sexual decisions...|`|y21ioFV5aa	YES! sheesh ofcourse it is but there might just be slight difficulties about your parents and stuff if their over protective of you but remember no matter how tough it is you will always have each other and don't give up  ( aza! aza! fighting! )|`|SvjjIJwiaa	It is possible, there is no age limit, however it is illegal for you to to have sex, until the girl is 16. Good Luck xx|`|bfy1Wqetaa	Age doesn't matter when in love but people may think it is odd as your 5 years apart, but then again, that's not that far apart.|`|BDEVP4qpaa	yes it is possible, but it usually isn't.|`|mSN2em8Qaa	yeah age is just a number.....My friend carmen she goes out with 21 year Old and she's only 15 year old she doesn't care as long as they love each other|`|qGg8O6F8aa	This Kinda reminds me about the song Jimmy and Jowny(I don't Know how to spell it) Sung along time ago..<br>  <br>  and it ended pretty bad.|`|BC0oVruEaa	yeah, i doesn't really matter about age, but it may seem as 'wierd' in society.|`|SmHaeishaa	THIS GUY SOUNDS PERVY ...........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But Yes love is possible : )|`|E638ukebaa	In my country thats illegal|`|dSA7TEwUaa	that much of an age difference is alright once your older|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	mhh not really at that point
4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	The guys that exhibit that behavior are immature. Sure guys like sex and that's understandable, but any guy that would pressure you into doing it before you're ready is a JERK!!! There are a ton of guys out there who are respectful and will consider your feelings in the relationship. Hold out and don't settle, you will meet the right one eventually! :)|`|dcDRHNDQaa	Hahaha I love girls for who they are and I look at thier face before thier **** I also like to know the girl I am "doing it" with isn't a skank I wouldnt get to the point of sex without knowing she loves me and I love her back, I love sex but I love sex with someone I love even more, and guys tend to need sex because its like an urge to release if you get my drift I dont just like pussy boobs and asses HAHA I like hair eyes curves and SMELL how could I forget that I really love girls for who they are also as I said knowing they love you on the inside makes me feel happy because it makes ME feel worth somthing to someone as does it to her, so in conclusion we are both happilly obsessed with each other and enjoy it ^^|`|tvDbQTJiaa	All the guys are not the same ! There are impatient gals too, who want sex prior to anything else.|`|eVubSKcEaa	I would ask the same thing about girls.!!<br>  No, not all guys are like that and the guys who are like that are assholes.. Love is not just sex.. but yes, there can be sexual relations in love. it is what brings each othewr closer.. it is supposed to be exclusive, only for the lovers..<br>  the guy should understand the girls feeling if she feels she is not ready for it..<br>  But lemme tell you this, not all guys are like that..|`|n1LWkT0paa	Not all guys just want sex. Some guys are just walking boners half the time. A respectable guy could bring the topic up curiously, but just because they do, doesnt mean thats all they want. He might just want to know if you are interested. If you arent, you can politley tell him, and if hes worth keeping he will wait.|`|sBE3ewn7aa	Thats why we invented marriage so that the guys are true to you girls.<br>  <br>  SO you girls dont have sex with boys unless you marry them.<br>  <br>  Marriage is to save you girls from these guys who look girls as sex objects.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	No. You are not at all legally married under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955. <br>  If this so-called Advocate say he got you legally married according to Hindu form of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 then he is misleading you & his enrollment as an Advocate should be revoked by indulging in illegal & unethical acts of getting married a Christian person without conversion to Hindu religion married to a Hindu according to Hindu form of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955.<br>  <br>  Just few weeks back the Supreme Court of India had decided this sort of issue where a Christian person without conversion to Hindu religion not only married the Hindu according to Hindu form of marriage but even got the marriage registered under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955, the lawyer in this case went all the way up to the Supreme Court to get the marriage declared valid under the Act,but as rightly held by the High Court & agreed by the Supreme Court the basic issue that the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 applies to Hindu Marriage and related matters & according to the Act a Hindu includes Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists but does not include rather excludes Muslims, Christians,Jews & Parsis. In that case too the Christian person was excluded according to the definition of Hindus & hence the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 was not applicable to the Christian Person & the marriage under the Act solemnized as well registered was Void Abnito i.e. it was no marriage at all.|`|cWuumdy7aa	yes your marriage is perfectly legal under hindu marriage act. it should not be in advocates office but in the registrar of marriage you will get a marriage certificate. just relax and enjoy your honey moon with my best wishes|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Of course it is.

I think it is special marriage act or something..<br>  But I dont think it doesnt falls under the Hindu Marriage Act..<br>  Please check up with another lawyer..|`|GllB4mPZaa	leave that office and get married properly as per the law of the land.|`|tGlnumvKaa	Duh!

My question is why? Why ask? Are you not happy?
8bWIL8RXaa	Honestly you need to tell your husband !!! and if that doesn't work confront your real teacher about it..you did nothing wrong he's just a wasted peice of male flesh|`|LT5HlW3kaa	I was going to college to get a masters in teaching, and I know this guy crossed the line. You should tell your husband, but you should also report him because that is a no no!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I would just ignore him if I were you. But if it bothers you I am sure there is some way you can report his behavior to the University he works for or even your own school. if you do report him save the emails he sent you as evidence.|`|i4ARGkHQaa	talk to ur husband about it he will know what to do
