PRzmwFfgaa	Pay attention to the little things that you are doing that may be inhibiting your hair growth.  Do you usually sleep on your left side?  Do you have a wool jacket or scarf?  Wool is very damaging to hair.  Things like this may be inhibiting your hair from growing evenly or causing it to break off more on the one side then the other.

If you are a wearer of brown or tan shoes- i think the first one is nice. i hardly ever wear anything but black sandals- and i always wear silver jewlery- so i'd probably get the silver.<br>  <br>  wow that's nice. i'm putting it on my birthday list right now!<br>  thanks!|`|berYSEW7aa	brown<br>  <3|`|vILQvJlmaa	SUPER CUTE......I like the gold and brown......but the pink and silver is cute 2<br>  <br>  Plz Answer Mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090220164226AAUf8uZ&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|ZvWyK94xaa	grayish silver one!<br>  awww its so cute!|`|0eeb948486d05d47f2a697bf50063ec2aa	I like the grayish silver color :]|`|1QURArm3aa	Pink...its my favorite color.|`|Lny9QMn0aa	the gray and the pink are definitely the cutest!!! (: the brown is too traditional and kinda old-lady-ish haha. i would say the gray because it will go with everything!!!!|`|8Nv4FogUaa	I like the silver one.|`|UQpwe9QRaa	there okay the C's look nicer because there not attached and now they have colors before it was mostly brown and black... I like how u can wear the new ones to the side|`|BjdUS3i8aa	the pink one it would add a pop to anything|`|YIFFjly3aa	Cute! The pink or silver would be my choice :)|`|frhF0X6aaa	i like it in all the colors
GLBWe3A9aa	No, its made to be worn on its own not with a t shirt under it|`|IfGTdMvAaa	uhh, no. that's just  not my style. if i were you, i'd wear it w/ a cardigan or something, cause if you wear it w/ a tee, it'd bring the shirt down.|`|EqTKurmraa	See Shitaly T-Shirt (TS090004W). It's wonderful!|`|HC6rrHLDaa	I think it would look good with more of a V-Neck type shirt. But a tee-shirt would look good too.|`|SF85i9REaa	No! wearing a tee or any other would take away from the style. looks fantastic wear it just like it is!|`|jYmLASPSaa	a long sleeve would look better|`|dsMvj16taa	no, i think it could be layered with some other tank tops with bright colors though
utAKfPYZaa	their probably little black heads that keep coming up. your nose and on your chin can get really oily too so it causes black heads. <br>  <br>  i dont know if thats what you mean by spots.....
JtrRRsUbaa	From my experience, the products are similar from brand to brand.  You should remember that the pictures on the boxes are not necessarily going to be your exact color results.  If you are going lighter, expect to end up somewhere in between your natural color and the color on the box.  If you want to avoid brassiness, use ash tones and ALWAYS strand test.  I used a golden blonde on my natural dark blonde/light brown hair once and ended up between a 14kt gold and goldfish color.  (NOT PRETTY!!)|`|ReDarchbaa	I always get good results with l'oreal feria.The color lasts longer to me,but I never really tried to many other kinds.|`|aiiLrvzLaa	dont use nice and easy ecspecially if your goin for blonde (it turns your hair orange) not a fun experience
AA11999436	Eat a good balanced diet to make sure that your hair is getting the right nutrients. Reduce stress on your hair so that you get less breakage - don't have tight braids or ponytails. Avoid shampoos and conditioners with sulfates in them and don't shampoo more than once a week. Don't brush your hair when it's wet, use a wide toothed comb and comb from the tips to the roots.

JVG4oyLKaa	thats exactly right, the best in my opinion for conditioner is definately tresseme|`|DVAhtK1raa	Always invest more in the conditioner. And always get anything that is a brand from a hairdresser. Its best to get a matching shampoo and conditioner as they're designed to work together. Try to always get a moisture or colour conditioner.
gKegXKaSaa	It works really well, but you have to be loyal to it (every day twice a day). It will take about a month to see full results, but that's true with any product.|`|JQ3Ibj9xaa	i use it now<br>  and it works great|`|zY9PdRGjaa	didnt work for me! if anything controls acne but thats about it.. i believe acne is cause by HORMONES so only something that regulates your hormones is going to give you significant results!|`|4gAaNAuwaa	no no no no no. i am 16 years old and had mild  acne before i used proactive. it wasnt anything seriously bad. just stubborn acne on my chin and forehead and the occasional stubborn pimple somewhere else. also once a month it broke out a little more than usual. but i wanted it gone so i decided i would use proactive. i used it for one month. it made my acne worse than it has ever been. i could not believe that something that is supposed to work so good made my skin so bad. i kid you not when i say that there is not one square inch of my skin that is not covered in acne or red marks from acne now. it is absolutely HORRIBLE. when i started proactive i only had acne on my forehead and chin. now it is COVERED MY ENTIRE FACE. it is horrible. i cannot use enough makeup. it literally now takes me 45 minutes to do my face in the morning. and it still looks bad. proactive RUINED my face and the scars from past acne are more noticeable than ever. i dont want to go out in public anymore i am still in shock that my face looks like this. even my mom said that proactive made my skin worse. now im waiting for my dermatologist appt. and i really hope they can help to nurse my skin back to how it was. proactive also drys your skin out so bad i still cant get enough lotion on my face. this was absolutely the worst thing that i have ever used. proactive ruined my life.|`|axheoEN4aa	I use it every night and it works for me =] Try using this if proactive doesn't work for you: <a href="http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearskin/index.view" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...</a>|`|x51SQHxDaa	ive used pro-active and it worked for me|`|CxcKaGiRaa	yes i have used it, my skin is oily so i only use it once a day but you have to use it every day to get results, and that hold true for every skin product, acne doesn't disappear overnight, it is a process, also, it helps if you run, its gets rid of the oils in your skin and try to not eat foods that give you break outs
FF3owv2kaa	hahaa im in middle school too:)<br>  and i think it's good...<br>  But if you wanted to change it up a little, i would need to know you're eye color, skin tone, and hair color:)|`|rdB2Pbldaa	Personally, I wouldn't start wearing a full-face foundation until high school.<br>  But otherwise it doesn't sound too bad. <br>  Except why do you use darker foundation under your eyes? You should use slightly lighter concealer for under-eye circles and use lighter eyeshadow under your brows to highlight it.|`|3rrmilhyaa	thats fine i wear:<br>  bronzer sometimes<br>  eyeliner<br>  mascara <br>  and coverup|`|armKGz9zaa	yeah i think i used to wear the same thing except use blush and  eye shadow so for a natural thing yeah|`|ITJtxINpaa	I think that this is a good amount of makeup <br>  <br>  LOL: Me too, I hate wearing mascara because I always get tired and I rub it by accident. Then, I look like a racoon :D|`|H2tkkWyPaa	Yeah it sounds pretty natural. I just wear a bit of black eyeliner (which blends in just fine because I have really dark brown hair) mascara, and occasionally some eyeshadow. I have pretty good skin and I don't like to wear foundation or cover up unless I have a huge pimple.|`|6GWctkQzaa	I would suggest this mascara, its really cheap in price too, less than $4.<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=professional_waterproof_mascara" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Only apply it on the TOP lashes. Don't get black mascara unless you have jet black hair. Get black brown if you don't.<br>  -<br>  I'm in middle school too and I use black brown because I have brown hair and its looks REALLY NATURAL. Use baby oil to get it off.|`|qzkWahFeaa	That's fine. Try maybe a little eyeshadow, and you could do it in earth tones if you want natural. Also, light pink blush to make you look rosy but not overly red.|`|tIPiGkKtaa	tottaly i wear make-up too!
0lewWYJdaa	get a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. and while you condition, keep it in for about 5 minutes in the shower.|`|nqGB8DPLaa	try Redken All Soft shampoo and cond. they are amazing. its for dry and brittle hair and it works wonders on my highlighted hair. it smells amazing too!|`|VbsHJGDxaa	oooooooooo use pantene time renewals mask its lyk 5 dollars and works beauties on hair!!!

qQqC2cHIaa	There really is no mystery to the identity of the real Lady Godiva who lived in England from 997 to September 10 1067.  In old English her name was Godgifu and she was a noblewoman from Coventry who wanted to make a public statement protesting the oppressive taxes levied against the vassals and tenants levied by her husband, Leofric The Earl of Mercia. She was more than just a Lady, her title was that of Countess, far above the mere rank of Lady. The naked ride was only a small part of her life.  She was quite socially conscious of lower classes of peasants and sought to help them out of poverty and ignorance.  Her and her husband built an abbey, among other things, to help the peasant class. He was, however, a bit greedy and decided to raise taxes against the peasants..  She disagreed and challenged him.  She decided to ride through the streets naked, partly as a dare and partly as a way to gain attention to the situation, and it was such a bold and daring act it became the source of many legends.  One part of the legend was that all the people of Coventry hid their eyes and dared not look on her, one brave man who did look at her was named Tom, and shortly after he became blind.  This is where the phrase "peeping Tom" comes from.  Peeping Tom appears to be a later addition to the story and there are no real records from the time of him<br>  <br>  Coventry England held the annual Godiva Festival from 1697 to the mid 1960's.  The role of Godiva was played by a scantily clad actress or dancer and part of the lead up to the festival was the rumour that this years Lady Godiva would appear naked.  She never did, of course, but it didn't stop the rumours.  <br>  <br>  The second story sounds like pure fiction written in the mid 1800's or thereabouts to scare children and teenagers and teach them a harsh lesson.  There were many stories of this type back in the day, from poems about thumb suckers getting their fingers cut off with scissors to kids starving because of stubbornness, this story sounds very similar to these children's horror stories. The story you relate is just that: a fiction with not a shred of truth.<br>  <br>  Like many other legends, details are added, stories embellished, rumours somehow become part of the tale, and it all becomes one big mess.  Fortunately for us, England kept records of nobility, their births deaths and notable achievements.  We know where Countess Godiva's tomb is and her ride against taxes is in documents from the era.Here's a few resources<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/godiva.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/godiva.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.abacom.com/~jkrause/godiva.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abacom.com/~jkrause/godiva.ht...</a><br>  <br>  None of these mention any teen girl being shamed, they tell only the true story of a socially conscious noble woman who led a fascinating and long life.  You can look up to along ago Countess, she may have rode naked on a horse, but she did nothing to be ashamed of.|`|XspPX1Ugaa	WATCH CHARMED<br>  haha she rode naked so powerful men would pay attention and listen to her or something.. they talked about it on charmed haha

AA10766729	I'd recommend going back to the place where you were pierced and have the pro's look at it and tell you whether or not all is well.    What you have is not normal....its indicative of an infection.<br>  <br>  Worst case, you go to the doctor and have them look at it.  You might need a topical antibiotic ointment, oral antibiotic or even have the piercing removed.

ovVZs8y5aa	first off going "emo" isnt just a snap decsion. you have to think about these things. i know it may seem like you want to do this now but in a few weeks will you regret it all? <br>  if your really sure you want to "become emo" first you can start with your hair and makeup. look up some pictures and you can pretty much guess what to do, the makeup you can obviously see a long with the hair-its lots and lots of teasing and hairspray and bows. <br>  hot topic has lots of stuff. hair extensions are big with the whole trend along with skinny jeans and vans or converse shoes, band tees are good or any tee with random things on it. claires has the arm warmers that they sometimes wear along with studded belts [they're way cheaper then the ones at hot topic but hot topic ones come in more colors and might be better quality] andd claires occasionaly has hair extensions and they havee knee high socks, and they have knee high socks at hot topic to. [some "emo" people wear them, some dont]<br>  if you have blonde hair i suggest getting hair extensions randomly colored, or getting random patches of hair dyed. <br>  <br>  think it over, make sure you want to do this.<br>  ~Rachhh.|`|qfhoCCzvaa	Emo is a Big thing... and quite frankly, kinda creepy... believe me... been there and done that.... and for starters, emos don't like labels, so dont call them emos but its your decision... black clothes you can get at like the mall and bargain stores and stuff, and black nailpolish, i think you could get it at drug stores,  black skinny jeans, skater and convers shoes and dying your hair, my mom is a professional hair dresser, so I know a little more about that kina stuff... you could get it done porfessionally, or you could buy the do it yourself stuff just dont start cutting yourself :)|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	You really sound like you are trying to make yourself into someone you are not..just to please someone else or fit in or because you think 'emo' people are cool.<br>  please reconsider changing yourself if you're doing it for the wrong reasons, because it sort of sounds like it...but i could be wrong.<br>  <br>  anyways, you can get black makeup and nail polish pretty much anywhere. and for the clothes, mostly shop at hot topic and pac sun has 'emoish/scene' stuff but it's more skater based clothes.|`|PmT8dPEqaa	Okay, remember to cut yourself down the road-never across the highway.<br>  <br>  Also when you take your sister's eyeliner make sure you put it back where you got it from to avoid confrontation. <br>  <br>  Also keep sharp knives and blades under your bed so that you can reach them faster whenever your feeling down. =]|`|EdxN0rCNaa	if your broke it ain't a problem make your own clothes. take any clothes that might look emo distress them.

You're gonna shock people if one day you show up all nice looking then bam next day emo. So first get the hair cut. The bangs in the eyes and everything. Get it at supercuts or do it yourself if you want it cheap. Then dye your hair black if you have to. Buy some color at the drugstore for like twelve bucks. Then start wearing skinny jeans. They don't  have to be designer but they do have to be tight. You can also get these basically anywhere. Go to target and get some. Then start wearing converse or vans. Now these can get pricey. Try the salvation army if you're really that broke. Now start wearing black band t-shirts. Old bands new bands doesn't matter. Or you could opt for a shirt with a broken/bleeding heart on it. Either works. Now do makeup. If you're not pale to begin with go buy some light concealer or foundation. (at cvs) Then line your eyes with black liner and shadow. Then paint your nails and add some funky jewlery that maybe your younger sister owned. THESE STEPS SHOULD BE DONE IN WEEK INTERVALS.|`|XqmJKlmwaa	being emo means emotional<br>  its strictly internal|`|RjGGsPInaa	nooooooooooooo donttt|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	eww|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	ew for u

RHtFUsgjaa	well layers are different lenghts of hair all around your head. This gives it more shape and usually volume. shorter layers means shortening those different lengths of hair around your head. for instance you could have some layers that go down to your collar bone and then some that go up to your jaw line. even shorter would be like cutting them so they are up to your ear or something. and then leaving the lenght at your collar bone<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|Z8E8nTXSaa	layers are where one "layer" is shorter than the other....like say ur hair is like 13 inches long......your bottom layer would be 13 inches then the hair on top of that would be 11 then the hair on top of that would be 9 inches...and so on....so shorter layers means that the top layer of hair is shorter than the rest

VhsvUoUyaa	well, this is what i do and get shiny hair without trying, depending on your hair tho.<br>  <br>  this is what i do, maybe it will work for you.<br>  <br>  I wash my hair, like so, and condition it really really well, then rinse it with warm water, not hot because it will dry it out, then when i get out of the shower, I comb it with a wide tooth comb, not brush, because brushing will make it frizzy, then i squeeze the extra water out with a towel and dry itjust a little with a hair dryer, but it helps if your hair dryer has a coolsetting. mine does and thats what makes it really shiny, then put some anti frizz stuff in it, the oil stuff, i dont know what its called, but they sell it every where, and comb it again, then continute to dry it with the cool setting on low, ( not the high setting where your hair flys everywhere) and then once your hair is done drying...add a little bit more anti frizz stuff to the long part of ur hair, not just the top...and walah. You should have shiny hair. <br>  <br>  Tell me if this worked for you, If not, Im sorry<br>  <br>  Oh and btw: Myshampoo is garnier fructice and its the moisturizing one.|`|hrAZPBGdaa	Shampoo and Condition it.

Sr4u5skgaa	Hello i completey understand how you feel although i dont think i had it as bad but i know how horrible it is.<br>  <br>  Right believe me when i say this works if it doesnt i will be surprised.<br>  <br>  First for the greasy face, buy a cream called Aqueous its like literally 3 pound frrom boots and u get a big tub of it it dont smell of anything its just really simple and plain. You put it on ur face like in the morning and its like a face wash and moisturizer, so yeah but it all over ur face in the morning then you wash it off like a face wash then put some more on by moisturizing it in to your skin. You will be probably be best to do this twice a day, morning and night.<br>  <br>  As for the spots, i use a special cream from the doctors called Duac Cream and its amazing, no lie it works. I have never found a cream like it. Its really strong and like peels your skin a little bit but it definitly gets rid of your spots. My friend recommended it to me as it worked for her as well.<br>  <br>  Hope it works for you if not im sorry but go back to a different doctor and try something different.<br>  Let me know how ya get on|`|NOMpvcC8aa	well idk if your mom will be cool with it but the birth control my gynecologist put me on has a side effect of clearing up acne. the brand is called tri-nesa. i Love the stuff cuz it regulates me periods, gets me from getting pregnant, and even clears my face. kills 3 birds with one stone. haha|`|Ograco3laa	i use to b the same way but i still have some acne here is a good website that helped me<br>  <a href="http://www.chootoo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chootoo.com/</a>|`|uJNVAA3saa	Since I have hit my teens my skin has began to get spotty. I used all different products but nothing worked so I went to my doctors. They prescribed some cream but it didn't work. In the end I just gave up trying to get rid off them. Lucky enough I was moaning about my spots to my cousin and she said I should use freedom cream so I decided to buy some. In my opinion its really really good and I'm glad she told me about it. I just apply some on my spots and it works straight away. I had this dreadful big spot on my chin a few days ago & I used it on it & the spot went down alot within a few hours and looked almost unnoticeable. I recommend you buy it because it has worked wonders for me. Hopefully it works the same for you too. It says on the tube use twice daily but I always use it more then that and I think that's also what has helped. You should try it.|`|Y0O6971laa	An asprin scrub could work.

tL8Go5ebaa	Gah! I want that hoodie SO bad, but they don't sell it anymore. It was sold on tour a while back, but that was it. <br>  <br>  One of the boys posted a blog about the merch for their upcoming BND tour with FOB. It mentioned that they're bringing back a few popular older merch items, but with new colors and slightly different designs for this BND tour.

Then use lots of gel and a flat iron. <br>  <br>  What you really should do is take the picture in to a hair stylist the next time you get your hair cut and ask the person to cut your hair so the style will work and then have them show you how to do it|`|ne6qFRt8aa	go to a salon where they sell paul mitchell products, to get that look you should get the firm style volumizing spary and the firm style freeze and shine super spray adn maybe the dry wax.|`|Y0O6971laa	Tease it and use hairspray.

XYEdP822aa	I used to use proactiv and I had the same case of acne you have. It worked. It cleared my face completely but once I started to limit the use of it, but I still washed my face and did all the other things, it made me break out even worse. So if your planning on using it for a short period don't. Your acne will just come back worse then before.|`|uUvV7eadaa	I used to have oily and sometimes dry skin, but now I use proactiv AND I drink alot of water. proactiv is great, but I needed the combination of the face wash and water to make my skin completely clear. which now it is thankfully :)<br>  <br>  yes, I believe it would work for you.|`|Yx7dBnHIaa	i wouldn't recomend it for a dry face. it helps with oil, but dries it our really bad. when your face is dry it produces more oil to hydrate. i recomend you use a cleanser for oily skin, and an oil free moisterizer. i tried proactive and it wrecked my skin terribly.|`|oFH5oq22aa	You dont have to have 100 zits to use proactiv. my experience with proactiv is that once i used it i had to continue using it or my face would break out again so its worth the try just remember they will continue shipping the product to you unless you cancel.|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i found this for you on your question

Ia4jEzQ4aa	since its real hair, the amount of time would be the same :)<br>  <br>  25 minutes.|`|gQTzcxW4aa	The best result is 30 minutes to 1 hour if you want to have strong color. The more you soak it longer the more it will last for 6 months or even more than a year,it depends upon the kind of hair color what you're using. Just choose the best brand,in my experienced,my mom's hair are almost turns into white and she wants to color it black so i fix the color and brush it in her hair,and leave it there for 1 to 2 hours,and it lasted more than a year. <br>  Just remember after applying the color don't cover it,let the fresh air dried it. Because if you put some cover on it,perspiration from our nits will mixed with the color that will result to weaken the color of your hair. Some beauticians used hair dryer after applying the color and leave it there for 30 to 1 hour,then rinse it thoroughly and dry it again, you will see the result. But if you want to have light color just minimize the time of leaving the color into hair and the mixing of the color.<br>  Hope it can help.|`|8fWvoPwvaa	It really depends on the dye you use, so read the directions carefully.  I'm a professional stylist and I would say about 30 minutes should do.  Black is easy to see when it has developed.  Make sure you use a permanent dye though, no semi's or demi's.  Good Luck.|`|XUPsK2Nsaa	I have no clue, im a dark blonde, i dyed my hair this morn was supposed to be a light to med blonde, it turned out red. Be careful what you do, before you do it. Cant turn back whats been done.|`|baMhIOQZaa	like 10 min.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222101821AANpWhc&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	I think you should keep the dye on for your extensions for the same amount of time. Since its human hair it should be the same time requirement. Also, the color you are using gives you an advantage because it's the darkest color the palette. So you are not going to have problem with different shades. <br>  <br>  All the best
AA11452031	Yes. :]|`|znngp3E0aa	Yep!
1Thb8v1yaa	id say try right after you get out of the shower. if you can only get it half way thru still...either get them re-pierced...orrr just push it thru the back.<br>  but it will go thru the healing process all over again..so dont take them out!!!|`|fYox2mwGaa	Mine did that years ago.  I got my ears pierced in the 7th grade and then I only wore earrings for a year.  I didn't try wearing them again until I was almost out of high school.  My right ear was closed up in the back and it did take quite a bit of gentle pushing and prodding with the earring.  My left one was so closed up that it took several days and when I finally got the earring through it was PAINFUL!!  It even bled a little bit.  Ever since then I make sure I wear earrings every now and then so that they don't get the chance to close back up.  <br>  Just be gentle... and patient.  If you can't seem to get the hole back open then try just a little bit over the course of a few days.  Unless you have to have them ready now... in that case your best bet would be to have them repierced.|`|gRPdX9fxaa	jus take an earring and depending on how closed up they are you should be able to jus shove it through...it dosnt hurt very much if at all|`|6C1oSVu3aa	just get a neetle and re pierced.<br>  <br>  it will hurt for like 3 seconds.but thats 3 seconds of your life so go for it!
7LRdjs1faa	A little leave in conditioner will work in a pinch, and make sure that the next time you wash your hair you use a good conditioner and leave it in for five minutes. <br>  <br>  Not using a protector once won't do too much damage as long as you have healthy hair - I didn't know I was supposed to use product before flatironing when I first bought my iron - I used it daily without any protection for about six months and it didn't cause too much damage. <br>  <br>  You should pick up a bottle of heat-protector for normal daily use, though. (I like BedHead's Afterparty, though it's not really supposed to be used for that purpose. A little bit in damp hair, then blowdry, then flatiron. It's expensive, but one bottle lasts half a year and will also help with straightening and controlling frizz.)|`|jaBjb6Nsaa	i wouldn't put any product on it, use little conditioner, and make sure theres nothing in your hair. The iron will probaly react to products and burn more. And yeah a low heat definetly will help. But theres awlays going to be a little bit of damage.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	Put some conditioner in and keep the heat low. Make sure your hair is dry too. It will burn if your hair is wet. Apply the conditioner (not too much) after you dry your hair.|`|v0FlUan0aa	i dont think so.. the only way is to turn down the heat on your flat iron. like dont put the heat on so high.|`|ANg8RFWUaa	Heat protection spray=P
C3aviMmyaa	use a large barrel curling iron and flexible hold hair spray|`|FENYDcY8aa	her hair looks like crap dont do it|`|Y0O6971laa	Bella looks like a troll.  Don't do it.  Her hair looks frizzy and dead so just choose another fashion icon :)|`|VVCNbN53aa	Get A Life<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  * To answer your other question* <br>  Because, I am sick of all of the fangirls running around- sacrificing their own individuality just so they can match some media icon.  <br>  Personally- I loved the book twilight, but this fanbase thing has gotten out of hand.

W9lwPeZuaa	just stop|`|Amkmles0aa	not all of us can shave pubic hair i an that way too|`|SgKsHxD5aa	ok, for some poeple just putting lotion or Vaseline on after they shave is fine.. if not, just trim it really short|`|d5COR2S2aa	hmmm.... well, no matter how hard he tries to wash them, hands will still have bacteria. the best thing to go for here is to just not shave... yeah, it doesn't look as attractive, but at least it still prevents bacteria from getting to the wrong places and prevents you from having a rash on the least preferable spot on your body.|`|GzlZmAWYaa	Im sorry but if you shave pubic hair it always grows back with a rash, it happens to everyone, the same as hair removal cream, the reason for this is: skin is much more sensitive down there and will rash up easily.<br>  <br>  glad if i help|`|pVdV4gwgaa	Maybe because you are sensitvie. You should ask him to wash his hands though. He might have touched something and the bacteria stays in his hands and you are allergic to it. This was ackward. :)|`|hrU14wMDaa	For hair removal try Magic Smooth Razorless Hair-Removing Cream. It is meant for African American males, but it is a very good hair remover for all parts of the body. Do a search online for Magic Cream, there should be some great information from women discussing it.<br>  <br>  Now, the rash, you really need to see a doctor about that. It needs to be looked at by a professional as just a description is not enough to tell you if it is something to be concerned with. Yes, it is embarrassing, but it is best to be safe than sorry.|`|9ZMkg9Cdaa	The rash is pretty much just from shaving all together. Most people that shave start to get a rash once it grows back because the hair down there is so thick unlike normal hair. The best advice would be to put some baby lotion on it. It helps with the itching and/or burning, it helps the rash to go away, and it keeps you moisturized.|`|yT29OZuvaa	Talk to a doctor and see what they think.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's just how your body is. Some people just can't shave it down there. Same with me. Maybe just trim it down a bit. Ask your boyfriend if he doesn't mind the 'hair down there', or just live with the rash... You can try waxing, I guess. I do not recommend that. I'm sure it hurts like crazy and probably isn't that safe...|`|LTFH5zBEaa	no that hasnt ever happend to me before but it happend to my friend and she went to the dr and he said that it was normal and maybe she was shaving to hard and too much. and to only do it like once every two weeks<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|S3Bd3JIDaa	you may need to condition the skin with lotion after you shave if it continues then you may need to see a dermatologist or just your family doctor|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	everyone gets a rash especially if you sweat.  Waxing is the only way to eliminate this problem|`|cxzQVRYiaa	Better let it get all bushy then.
MZVvydPBaa	you should leave the side fringe straight. try using diva curl or some other curling product and either scrunch your hair or if that isn't enough, put the product in it and pin your hair up in a few messy buns. if you either sleep on it or leave it like that for a few hours it should come out a bit wavy. ir you could straighten it all together. or pull it back some how whether it be by braids, pigtails, a ponytail. there are tons of options. BE CREATIVE! but not too creative|`|plBXp91Daa	You could try this hair style what this actress has.<br>  <a href="http://movies.newscrux.com/wp-content/gallery/raaz2-stills/raaz2-nc-074.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://movies.newscrux.com/wp-content/ga...</a><br>   I liked her hairstyle a lot.|`|RivwZRNsaa	Put it in a plait and spray with hair spray leave for a while then talk it down grab your fringe pull up twist put and place on your head then hold down with clips and hair spray so your left with nice curled/ criped hair and a high quiff.<br>  <br>  Hope this makes sense you could also add small random  plaits xx|`|AA11634944	Since your hair is thin I would suggest a cute up-do. Try taking the hair on the top/crown of your head and teasing it. Twist it into a bun and pin it at the back, being sure to leave some hair underneath it. Use the hair on the sides and underneath to pin around the bun giving it a messy appearance. Be sure to leave strands around your face out, and you can even try curling them to give it a different look.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work try giving yourself beach curls, there is a good video on youtube which I'm too lazy to look up.|`|yT29OZuvaa	Try curling it! I think it would look really good. Or you could put it in braids. <br>  Or you could do a couple mini braids near your bangs which would look great. <br>  Or try a ponytail, or a side ponytail. <br>  Or you can put it in a clip and flip it up.<br>  Or you can put it in a cute messy bun.<br>  Maybe try parting your hair a different way?|`|Vg0SrHUCaa	A REALLY simple this to do is take the hair right next to your bangs, not on the side close to the part, and pull it back and clip it.

You just curl the bottom 3/4 of the hair and then loosely let them down. Don't put lots of hair spray and it won't give you the free spirited look.|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	oh my goshhh!

PK9R1V8gaa	ya all of tresemme products work really well-they're used on the runways a lot, and were used on Project Runway. you should also try a deep conditioner once a week to soften your hair and repair damage, and use a heat protectant spray when you straighten it-tresemme has one :)|`|ne6qFRt8aa	honestly off the shelf products are not a good choice, they say it works but there are too many unhealthy things in the products that can harm your hair, honestly it costs a little more but your could go get a few paul mitchell product and that will help. you don't even have to get the shampoo.... read the back of the products and it will tell you. i would have recommended the super skinny serum but you said your hair is fine... i know a few other of the products are also a thermal protector... i think the express soft spray is and it smells really good too.

That is the only way to get rid of split ends. Using restorative products ( for example pantine pro-v restorative leave in conditioner) only strengthens the hair but doesn't get rid of your split ends. Using a hair mask once a week will dramatically improve the look and feel of your hair. I suggest going to your local drug store and finding specific shampoos/conditioners/masks/products for damaged hair and protectors that you can use while straightening your hair|`|YEAfXgwQaa	Pantene, and they make a separate leave in conditioner that makes your hair soooo soft! the leave in conditioner is called intensive restoration treatment, but also there are vitamins you can take orally, if you go into a supplement store. sometimes you have to fix the problem from the inside.<br>  Essential fatty acids are a good oral supplement for your hair as well.|`|xHUDMxxWaa	Hey :]<br>  <br>  Herbal Essences and Pantene ProV are fantastic!<br>  <br>  My hair is fried too and these have really worked.<br>  <br>  Also, before straightening, apply heat defence spray evenly to hair.<br>  <br>  I Hope I Helped<br>  0x|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	I use herbal essenses for dry/damaged hair<br>  its the pink one, and smells like roses<br>  it works really well! :)|`|NpxzICoraa	i think that you should get either dove or pantene shampoo, they're always the best for me

SZZkfVzbaa	"Peel them off"<br>  Oh my God, don't even go there.<br>  <br>  To be honest, getting them removed Professionally for like $10 - $15 is totally worth it. Doing them at home can be tricky, and can definitely cause damage to your natural nails which will last forever. <br>  <br>  To do them at home, buy a bottle of Nail Polish Remover with Acetone [The Avetone is very important; it's the Chemical that melts the Acrylic]. Pour the Remover into a bowl [not Plastic or metal - it'll melt the plastic and taint the metal. Apply Vaseline to the skin that will be submerged in the Acetone, to avoid drying out. Soak your fingers in the Remover for 20+ minutes. It's important NOT to keep checking or pulling your fingers out; this will cause the Acrylic to harden again, and you'll have to start the whole soaking time all over. When the time is up, the Acrylic should be very soft; soft enough to scrape off with an Orange Stick. Pull out one finger at a time to do so, and work quickly. Wipe Acrylic onto some paper towels [which should be placed under the bowl anyway, to catch drips]. It is practical to soak one hand at a time so it's easier to remove each nail. Warming up the Acetone will speed up the process, but do NOT heat it up in the microwave; Acetone is highly flammable, so unless you want to blow up your kitchen and set your house on fire, I wouldn't even try the Microwave. Instead, place the bowl of Acetone on top of a bowl/saucepan of very hot water and leave for a few minutes. It doesn't have to be hot-hot, but any heat will make the whole process quicker. If you still have little bits of Acrylic on your nails, remove by filing down the bumps and finish the job by applying two coats of clear, strengthening nail varnish, some hand lotion and cuticle oil.<br>  <br>  I removed my nails myself by picking at them [I as cereful because I had heard of other people saying NO] and regardless of that, my nails were still damaged. The white part of my nail isn't straight and a few of my nails are very weak because I had to file the Acrylic off in some areas. <br>  <br>  I will never remove my nails myself anymore and with all the drama and hassle; it's SO worth paying to get them removed Properly!<br>  <br>  They do look like Acrylics, but if they were cured under a UV light they are Gels and can be removed using the same Method, although you'll have to file the surface of your nails with a nail file to remove the Gel Top Coat [just briefly]. Do so only if the Acetone doesn't ment the Acrylic.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|CAhunDFnaa	get a bottle of nail polish/nail remover and Soke your nails in it till they dissolve (make sure it has acetone in it)|`|jsCjGUPuaa	peel them off but it hurts like a beotch|`|qgDCcNQqaa	Yeah, pick them off, soak them aswell to make it a bit easier.<br>  Look it up online.

M2dr9Ykzaa	I had the exact sam problem this summer. The hairdresser cut my hair soooooo short that I cryed!! It was terrible and then i went to sleep alway camp and i was litterally the ONLY girl ther with short hair! I felt terribly ugly. But, there really was nothing I could do to change it, so i mad ethe most of what i could. <br>  Get some hair products, there are ones that protect your hair form heat, there are some really good ones on the pharmacy and then get a de-frizz cream. Make sure your hair straightner is ceramic.<br>  If you really hate the short hair, you can get extentions, a lot of my friends have those, and if you dont want the bangs, clip them back. <br>  I know i felt that my hair looked worse than it was, and my hair was a LOT shorted than my shoulder!! To you it might look worse because you are use to a different look, and it might take some getting use to. Walk proud and whatever vibe you give off will be perceived my other. Work your doo. :P<br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  answer mine??<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AqpiL5fh7W7EQ0wee93kZLDpy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=Aqpi...</a>|`|xuvqrnOoaa	uhmm what does your age have to do with any thing?? :S.. uhmmm well heres what you could douse a defrising serum asnd a shine spray.. nthen pin your bangs back|`|Wy3wddFlaa	Dont worry it will grow back.|`|AA10662866	shave it all off dearie, end of problem x|`|VzBLSyfkaa	Here are some products that you could try that might help:<br>  <br>  Herbal Essences "Hello Hydration" shampoo and conditioner<br>  <br>  Herbal Essences "None of Your Frizziness"<br>  <br>  Tresseme "Mostuire Protection" spray<br>  <br>  Maybe some Moose and Gels<br>  <br>  And when you do flat iron your hair, I would recconmend using a heat protectant. It really sounds like using that isn't helping your hair, rather than destroying it. Flat irons burn hair, unfortuantely. Maybe, you could also consider getting bangs, like as in blunt bangs. They're very popular now.|`|UxoiBujkaa	at least you're hair isn't course like mine chick...|`|bc589077ec0e87615d62669072a4ad34aa	Ok, <br>  <br>  First of all id like to point out that you think you suffer from depression??

Look at poor Jade goody, dont see her complaining!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, what is your question???? its just a moaning passage, you want it longer? You have to wait.

GzlZmAWYaa	It sounds really weird but, you can make hair really nice and curly using straighteners! What you do is you grab near the root with the straighteners, and you wrap the hair around the outside of the straighteners, slowly bringing all the hair through the tongs, and then you use your hand and twist the hair in the prefered direction.<br>  Then you could put in a high ponytail with a clip it looks really nice.|`|GiWKnF26aa	you could curl it<br>  leave it down<br>  grow it back out<br>  put in hair pins<br>  use headband <br>  get it professionally done<br>  get help from friends<br>  pony tail<br>  braids<br>  french braids|`|rYxIs47Gaa	Headbands<br>  Pouf or Poof however you spell it<br>  Straight <br>  Curly|`|hahwsMd7aa	try curling it|`|Mro8j1yYaa	head bands are always cute.

xC11PIlhaa	I suggest you should just go to a hairdresser BEFORE u do anymore damage! <br>  <br>  But for some reason i sincerely admire you!! .... persistent :P!|`|WDbE5gffaa	Your first mistake was bleaching black hair.<br>  Black hair is a horrible thing to change. <br>  You've done alot of dyeing to your hair, so its going to be pretty damaged. <br>  Its gone orange due to an underlying hue of orange in your hair and the dye. Blue counteracts orange, and green counteracts red. You'd probably be best of trying a blonde dye which is green or blue based, an ash blonde is green based, and i'd recommend trying that.  Use a dark ash blonde on it, and i think it will be fine, but very damaged. So be gentle with your hair!|`|TohMjq04aa	nice hair jeanette

udpdCqQ2aa	Next time you go in to get your hair cut, ask if they can thin it out in the back..ask them to stay away from the top b/c that just creates fly aways..<br>  <br>  LOL vote me as best! :)|`|LIlLGRSYaa	use a straightner duh|`|Twq7efhQaa	I had the same problem.  Go and get your hair cut and ask for it to be thinned out this means that it will be razored with a special pair of scissors.  You will really notice the difference and will be so much easier to straighten.  Heres some pics of what thinned out hair looks like:<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.myhairstylingtools.com/blog/wp-content%2" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhairstylingtools.com/blog/w...</a>|`|d5nrez6gaa	don't make it thinner! people with thin hair want thick hair. someone who had their hair thinned said "you've got really thick hair, don't ever make it thin." when you're older you'll be glad :) its a waste otherwise though. just straighten it or curl it. once in a while get it straightened ~ but don't make it thinnerrrr x|`|PdSeeHdkaa	same here,<br>  i did get it layered and now my hair is thin , but it won't stay straight.. <br>  after i shower, it drys up and becomes puffy <br>  i just keep straightening it :)|`|j51RT5vAaa	i suggest getting short layers in the back|`|YKMBnIrFaa	That sometimes happens to my hair when I let it air dry. If you want it to be thinner, you will probably have to blow dry it, brushing it out while you do so. The quicker you dry your hair, the less poofy the excess moisture will have a chance to make it. If it's still not as straight as you would like it after that, go ahead an straighten it.|`|TrzAPwkXaa	Well, first, thick hair is like the style! but if you want it thin and straight, het a STRAIGHTNER!!!! i already have straight hair and it still makes it look good. If you got layers, it would make you hair thinner. After i got layers, it made my hair feel so much lighter!!!|`|IOhYpHpQaa	I have the same situation. I get my hair thinned at my hair stylists but I also get a Japanese Straight Perm to relax my hair. It's pretty expensive though and you have to renew it every year. But if you don't want to spend the money then a flat iron would do. =D|`|9KFfjun8aa	Go to your hair dresser and ask them to thin out your hair. then get a straightener and straighten your hair. If you do not have one i would recommend is a chi!|`|KA8KhNlgaa	ya.. just ask ur stylist to thin it out with layers then use a straightener and straighten it..|`|ZfDa40PEaa	ask your stylist to thin it out with layers, then use a straightener :)
PTWjkYu8aa	i dont think there is a way<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry|`|VEhj9pleaa	You can bleach them or if they are long that can be a cause of the darkness.|`|kUhcypC9aa	You can dye your eyebrows with a special kit that you can buy from most pharmacy's etc but make sure you buy the specific one for eyebrows. Or be on the safe side and get it done at a salon :) x|`|X1uOh8ylaa	I would go to a salon that specializes in bleaching eyebrows but if you want to attempt it yourself. Here's a link that may help.<br>  <br>  Instructions Difficulty: Moderately Easy <br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Facial hair bleach <br>  Clean disposable mascara wand <br>  Paper towel <br>  Washcloth <br>  Step 1 Check your brows to make sure you haven't scratched them, recently plucked, or have any open injury to the skin. If there is even a tiny scratch, applying bleach will burn terribly and may further damage your skin. <br>  Step 2 Wash and dry your face. <br>  Step 3 Use the mascara wand to comb your eyebrows so the hairs are as straight and spread out as possible. <br>  Step 4 Dip the mascara wand in the facial hair bleaching cream. <br>  Step 5 Dab off any excess cream onto a paper towel. You want to be able to comb it through your eyebrows without any of the bleach dripping off. <br>  Step 6 Starting at the center of your brow, comb the bleach through. Work outward and be cautious not to drip any bleach. If any gets on your skin or starts to drip, wipe it off your skin immediately. <br>  Step 7 Watch the color of your brows. Some bleach will only take one minute to achieve desired lightness, while others may take up to ten minutes. Never leave it on longer than the package recommends. Bleach can cause chemical burn, blisters, skin lightening, and other ill effects if left on the skin too long. <br>  Step 8 Once desired lightness has been achieved, use a damp washcloth to remove the bleaching cream. Once all remnants of the cream have been removed, then wash your brows with soap and water. Using the washcloth will limit any of the cream running down your face or into your eyes.|`|yQF4yldxaa	sun light lemon juice peroxide they all work really well put any of these chemicals on you eyebrows and sit in the sun but make sure after wards that you condition and grease or make sure you hair is moisturized{don't get it in your eyes}<br>  but if you mean lighter by less heavy then tweeze extra hair i dnt advise wax because its a dramatic change if u tweeze then u pluck hair by hair and you can change bit by bit what you want|`|YaiqCrVGaa	depending how thick they are, pluck or wax them, and try using a light skin colored or light brown eyeshadow to just lightly brush over your eyebrows.
dM1jwSGyaa	i think you can buy them from department stores, e.g. nordstrom.com or something. that's what my friend did (i'm from canada too). one store had a promotion a few months ago - like, free shipping on uggs. i'm not sure if it was applicable to canada though.<br>  <br>  uggs are cheaper in the states anyways; short is like $120 and i bought talls for $160 at lord and taylor. with that being said, the currency exchange rate right now is AWFUL. can it wait until next year?|`|i1PXebLvaa	Well, ebay has alot of good ones, but even if you live in Canada, and I've been there, you can try payless or your local mall. But most internet websites wont include shipping to canada.-Hope that helps!! :))|`|KpkMIt4Waa	I just got a pair from uggid.com and they're real uggs. I believe they ship to Canada because they ship internationally. AND free shipping. They come in the box with all the documentation. I got the Cardy ones for $85. And might try uggor.com. They're even less expensive and free shipping.|`|wNryD2Iiaa	I know of a site that will allow you to shop in US sites and give you a US shipping address. Try <a href="http://www.usunlocked.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.usunlocked.com</a> -- I signed up for a free account, and It’s awesome because I can now shop at my favorite US online stores – like zappos and gap. The shipping costs from the US shipping address to yours is very economical compared to other sites, too.

v90vFco1aa	No, it's 18. I'm positive. I live in California and my mom would never take me to get cartilage or second holes or any of that. Once I went to college, I was 18 and got about 8 piercings in a year haha. Places like Claire's and piercing stands in the mall will all card you. Whether a piercing shop will depends on the place. But the legal age to do it without consent is 18, for sure. I know cause I had to wait haha.|`|iMaYLGECaa	I'm pretty sure it's 16
SzZxgHdtaa	At 11 I was capable of doing my hair. But I think you ought to show her how to do it and warn her to be careful (tell her where she should avoid touching)<br>  Make sure she uses a heat proof mat.<br>  <br>  I think perhaps you should supervise her using this for the first few times. Make sure she turns it off at the end.<br>  <br>  It's easy to forget many 11 year olds are quite mature.|`|oKY0s2THaa	It depends how responsible she is. Let her use it but watch over her. <br>  <br>  If she looks lost then wait a little longer. When I was 12 I was a whiz on the flat iron.|`|AX13vUJeaa	Well, everybody burns them self.<br>  <br>  It's perfecty fine.|`|pGIADFNxaa	It's not okay,and she will burn herself.|`|g9WH6MLRaa	I think anyone who uses a flat iron is taking a risk of burning themselves, i mean i know full grown adults who still occasionally burn themselves by accident.<br>  i think that she will be fine as long as you sort of help her at first, but still let her feel independent about it, and then gradually let her do it alone. With the right guidance i am sure she will not burn herself.|`|eOgHbhHxaa	i think it's alright, but make sure you know how to use it correctly!<br>  becuase they CAN cause serious injuries.<br>  i was being stupid one time and i put it on a book on my bed and i fell over while trying to put pants on and i got a very bad second degree burn on my bum.<br>  and i'm fifteen.<br>  so if you feel that you're mature and responsible enough, i'd say it would be safe.|`|47avjWrhaa	Depends on the parents decision.. And depending upon how mature the 11 year old is..  But if its their first time, I personally think that the parent should be there, Just in case.|`|vHkIHbMkaa	let her i do everyday almost and im only 12 well almost 13. but just tell her to be careful and she will do fine. good luck!|`|HQFUnslhaa	I think it's ok for an 11 year old to use a flat iron as long as she is responsible.|`|YinL4crmaa	She'll burn herself.|`|Iuy8RryRaa	no i think its fine, just get some one to show u what ur doing tht way u wont burn ur self! :)|`|6Tx8Opmraa	It's fine...Anyone can burn themselves with a flat Iron(I do it, several times..and I've flat Ironed my hair for years.).|`|SS87lbOCaa	i think its ok if she is responsible enough and wont forgot to turn it off and will use it correctly
PumDOQC9aa	How much did you bought it for? Try selling it for the same price you bought it for.

MrDNaxYAaa	Have you tried anything from the body shop for your hair? They have real good stuff!|`|oKY0s2THaa	You would have to cut off your dead/split ends or it will make your hair worse.<br>  <br>  Next time you flat iron your hari always use a heat protectant and don't flat iron it wet.

Make sure to deep condition it too.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	Get your hair trimmed to get rid of dead ends.<br>  <br>  If you're frying your hair by using a blow dryer or flat iron or curling iron all the time, be sure to use product on your hair.<br>  <br>  Your hair has natural oils. When you use these things to style your hair without any product in it, the heat burns out the natural oils in your hair and dries it out. When you have product in your hair, (anything really... but smoothing gels and heat activating products are good...) the styling equipment burns out the product that is on top of your hair, instead of the natural oils within your hair.<br>  <br>  Get a conditioning treatment done at your local salon, or, put vegetable oil in your hair, like soak it, braid it to keep it off your face and neck, put a towel over it, and sleep with it in overnight, wash it out in the morning, and you've done an at-home conditioning treatment that really works!|`|kMyERo6uaa	first of all,<br>  i know this sounds hard, but you can live:<br>  Stop using all that heat!<br>  just throw your hair up in a messy bun, your hair will thank you!<br>  <br>  cut your ends off, & dont straighten on the weekends.<br>  <br>  & when you start to straighten again, use a heat protector.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222091557AA1wsb2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  help me?|`|nuFCByKJaa	stop straightening your hair.|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	use heat protector like i tell you ever time yuo do it!!!|`|Tcv3dDqKaa	don't let them go away, your dead ends are sexy, it's probably from me and you staying up all night straightening your hair, but i like the dead ends, they bring out your eyes and make you look like a real champion|`|bcYRWlAHaa	get your hair cut more frequently and blow dry/curl/straighten it less.<br>  and when you do use heat tools on it, sprize on a heat protectant spray on first. they sell some good ones at cvs or wallmart or basically any drug store.|`|h65PtinWaa	If you use hot products like a straightener or curling iron use heat spray and then finish with leave in conditioner. <br>  <br>  Keep it moisturized as much as you possibly can!!

g3IXprk9aa	I actually really like the red one. It's more classy and feminine. The purple one seems like 16 year old girls would be wearing that. I'm in my 20's so maybe my taste is a bit different, but I def. think the red one would look very flattering on a nice woman's figure, not to mention it's classy and adorable.

IT's really not hard at all. It doesn't take that long etiher, I have hemmed my jeans for a while, since I'm a bit short for my pant size.<br>  <br>  Or you can just take it to the tailor. If they mess up or u don't like the result, just let them know and they should refund it. If the price is a big issue to you, just ask them the price ahead of time. They can't surprise you with hidden fees then!<br>  HOPE THIS HELPED!!!! :)|`|k2ZKQuyGaa	I think you should fold them over, not under. I see a lot of people do that and it doesn't look bad.

Go in a say that you want to get a few inches off and then they will have you wear them and they will show you what the alterations will look like as you are there. Then you can say, "Do you think you can make this a bit tighter. I want them pretty snug" <br>  <br>  If they get it wrong in the end, go back and say something.

They fit nice and snug that way.<br>  <br>  However, I think your tailor will be able to handle it. After all, it's what she does for a living. Just try them on, and SHOW her what you want, instead of telling her.<br>  <br>  One of my friends had the same problem, and since they were bunched so much, she took a big black safety pin and pinned the bunched area together horizontally, and it actually looked really good.|`|HJrTuihcaa	okay, don't fold them under the jeans, fold the bottoms on top of the jeans , i don't have a picture and if you don't get what i'm saying then just fold them under your heels, it might look weird to you but it doesn't to other people.|`|7ldEn0fJaa	they r suppose to be bunched up at the bottom|`|URcj1WwAaa	Go to a dry cleaner place.

Ask your hairstylist about what you need to use.  Good luck!!!|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	i blow dry a lot too, and it's not good. dry naturally if possible.

The price range is 50-230$. <br>  If you want small sections it would cost cheaper and how long the extension is. If you get a bigger like 23" it will cost a lot more and if it s longer it will cost more too. So just check your local drug stores and places like ulta, sephora, etc.|`|8fWvoPwvaa	Like 100-150 bucks.  Pretty affordable now these days.|`|cDNMB0GAaa	idk maybe 40 - 150 bucks|`|6nBks0rAaa	It depends what sort of extensions you get.  I would get clip in ones because they are much better for the health of your hair.  They cost about 100 usually.  You have to get them cut to your hair style so that costs a little extra too.

You can buy it in a solid form in a plastic canister at health food stores and many discount stores (such as Walmart). Let it liquify in a bowl of hot water, and once it is liquified, scrub it into your hair and scalp. Leave it on for 25 minutes, then rinse your hair throughly. I always wash my hair with a coconut oil based shampoo and a coconut oil based conditioner, both of which are really great for moisturizing your hair. <br>  <br>  Avoid products that contain alcohol, especially shampoos and conditioners as they will dry your hair out, and will defeat the purpose of the moisturizer that you choose to use.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

xgRgPkCiaa	I like most of your choices. Here is what i think personally. I like the long ones better than the shorter ones. I rated them 1-5 to make it easier to choose the perfect ones.<br>  1.... 3 I don't like how it puffs out. I like the straps.<br>  2.....2 The color is bad, and don't like the style.<br>  3.....2 Too plain<br>  4.....I like it but it is a little too short for me. Its really what you like for your style.<br>  <br>  5....4 I love the style, i like the color on that better than the other one because it is long.<br>  6....2 I don't like the blue flower.<br>  7....3 I like style, very elegant but i don't like it is a white.<br>  8....5 This one is my favorite is will look great with your brown hair, and the style will own, and the color is perfect. Not to light and not to plain, or dark.<br>  9....2 I don't like the color, or the flower on any of these.<br>  10..2 I like the green color. But No!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped. As you could see i like the longer ones way better. The 1st one was nice but the white. I would say if your more the the skinny type, then show it off with the long ones and the olive green one. If your not the skinny type then go with the knee length ones.<br>  <br>  Have fun at your prom,<br>  <br>  Ariel|`|srDGX5Mbaa	on a scale of 1-10<br>  1: 7<br>  cute!!<br>  2: 6<br>  pretty, dont really like the color though<br>  3: 7 1/2<br>  pretty!!<br>  4: 3<br>  really ugly color<br>  5: 5<br>  pretty nice, but too long<br>  6: 7 1/2<br>  pretty, almost the same as #3 tho<br>  7: 4<br>  ugly, too long<br>  8: 4<br>  same as 7<br>  9: 7<br>  cute, nice color<br>  10: 9<br>  pretty!! color will look really good with your eyes and hair|`|YOxHA46haa	ok, same rating system 1-10<br>  1. 9.5<br>  2. 8<br>  3. 9.5<br>  4. 6<br>  5. 4<br>  6. 8<br>  7. 7<br>  8. 6<br>  9. 6<br>  10. 5<br>  i would wear some sort of heel.it doesn't have to be high, maybe just a small 1, but those dresses are too pretty to just wear flats with.|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	4 or 10|`|2vHIn8VMaa	My favorite is 4 and 5|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	ok, all those dresses are cute and sexy. But i would not wear a white (cream is better) or black at prom, i mean it's fine, but it looks more like a wedding, and black ..it seems like less ppl wear black to a prom, so ..and i saw some of the dresses u choose are purple (light is better) and i think it's a lil old. Just ask your self what do you go for, sexy, cute or elegant ..?? if cute, choose the dress that jst pass the knee, sexy, wear a long dress with high heels and ur hair, oh ur hair is important too.. u wanna look special at the prom with ur everyday hair. So do something to it....i suggest u go to the salon, just told them to do ur hair (it's less than $20 i promise) and it's fast, not like to cut ur hair, but they knw the styles.|`|319vJyXoaa	Based on your description of yourself....I'd say the long navy blue one would be the only one that works. <br>  White or pale colors will wash you out.<br>  Black will over power your skin.<br>  And since you're sort of short (no offense) you won't want the shorter dresses.  They'll all just hit below your knee and make your legs look short, even while wearing heels. <br>  Email me and I'll help you find some that will defiantely work for you!<br>  xxxizzyxbellaxxx@yahoo.com|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	My favorites are numbers 10, 9, and 5. Depending on just how pale you are, I would avoid white for the fact that it may make you disappear into looking like a ghost. Greens and blues would make your features stand out and purple just looks pretty on many brunettes. Personally, I hate how they have all these short prom dresses now, so I'd go for a longer dress just because it is more traditional looking.|`|ppBYeYG9aa	My favourites are 1,4,5,7 and 8 ... there all really gorgeous choices though...|`|NyiaT2FYaa	1. 5<br>  2. 4<br>  3. 4<br>  4. 5<br>  5. 2<br>  6. 4<br>  7. 4<br>  8. 5<br>  9. 4<br>  10. 6|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	4 is my favorite...

D8m1eqlVaa	Have you tried sugaring? It's similar to waxing but much more gentle and you can make the solution at home pretty easily. I've heard of many men using it for back hair removal. It lasts two to three weeks before the hair grows back, so it would definitely be less time consuming than shaving<br>  <br>  Here's an article on how to do it, if you're interested. <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4748097_perform-sugaring-hair-removal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4748097_perform-...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck! I think once you try it, you'll be hooked. I sugar my legs every few weeks and it keeps them smooth and soft, and each time the hair grows back thinner and less noticeable. Plus, it doesn't cost anything, besides the cost of sugar. hehe.|`|s0wUXkIRaa	Its called a razor

v64IwD5xaa	its kind of difficult at first, but you get the hang of them quickly. You should try practicing around the house first.. I started wearing heels when I was 14. Once, i bought these gorgeous heels and i wore them to school, i was so happy and every1 gave me so many compliments! The only thing was they didn't exactly fit, and they were hard to walk in. When i was going down the stairs my shoe slipped.. and i slid down the entire stair case on my knees! all my books went over the railing and landed on kids on the 1st floor! everyone was laughing and stuff.. it was pretty embarrassing.. but im not one to really care i just kind of laughed it off..  at least it was in the freshman hallway!|`|J7rJELKWaa	its kinda hard the first time you wear them, cause your not use to being that tall while walking( if that makes sense lol) . i have never really had any bad experiences, but thats because i wear heels all the time since i'm short compared to everybody at my school( i'm 5'4'' and their all 5'6'' or taller). wedges will be easier to walk in since its your first time and once you get to use them you can go to pumps or something.|`|qXxSBBRFaa	First off, heels are not uncomfortable if you find a pair that fit. Of course it's not the same as a pair of slipper, but heels aren't as bad as people say they are. You have to find a pair tight enough so you're not slipping out, and lose enough that it not crushing your toes. start out with someone small and work your way up. For prom, you'd want skimpy strappy pretty heels..but it all depends on your dress. It's easier to find short heels for things like prom, or weddings, or other formals. Formal heels are probably the most comfortable, so I wouldn't worry about it. Just shop around until you find a pair you love and fit into!<br>  <br>  p.s.. if you practice, make sure you practice walking up and down stairs! It took me about a year to be able to walk down stairs normally in heels.|`|Pe3e7wwYaa	I've no idea considering I'm a lad, but heels are definitely the way to go for girls. The height and figure of a girl wearing heels definetly increases attractiveness in comparison to a girl wearing flat show such as ballet-style pumps.|`|NyiaT2FYaa	It just depends on the heel. They were simple the first time because mine were not that high of a heel but the second time was impossible. I started when I was 12|`|1IP0RqXYaa	it can be a little awkward but my advice is to just try to walk like you normally would without heels, be smooth|`|ZHBNz6D2aa	well its weird at first but you just have to get used to them. If you want to wear them at prom then i would suggest wearing them regularily before because people look weird walking in heels their first time.|`|UBdWXScKaa	whatever you do<br>  wear them around the house for like a week or so <br>  to get use to it,<br>  because at first it is wobbly,and you look like a duck, and<br>  is a bit too uncomfy<br>  & i started wearing heels when i was 10, but that was for a wedding.
q7i9QZg5aa	Not too difficult. The only hard part will be the hood. You will however need a sewing machine and basic sewing abilities. If you have no experience then I would suggest you look elsewhere. Someone with a beginner sewing class should be able to recreate this look.

Don't wear heels or sandals, you want something a bit more robust in case your feet get trampled (if it's a standing gig). Something like Converse would be good. Dress for comfort like leggings or jeans.

The owner of the company is very... sexual.  Haha, I watched a documentary about him and his company and he's just like that.

Low rise jeans would not hide a curvy butt at all. Low rise jeans are often very tight, which also doesn't help your problem. If you want to somewhat "hide" your butt, go for darker washes because they have an over all slimming effect. I'd stay away from those real tight stretch jeans, because those do nothing but squeeze you in all the wrong areas. I'd go for a jean with a higher rise, maybe right below the bellybutton. Usually curvy women who wear low rise jeans end up with that muffin top effect. Unless you're a toothpick, low rise jeans will find a way to make a 120lb girl look fat.

298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	Right now, no one knows when this season will begin airing. As you said, it was supposed to start this past January, but has obviously been delayed. Also, they just filmed the finale this past week (New York Fashion Week). The reason for the delay is that NBC Universal (who owns Bravo) has filed suit against the Weinstein Company (who produces the show) for violating contract agreements. The case has yet to go to court and no date has been set for the hearings. Until the case does go to trial, Lifetime is barred from airing any of the episodes from Season 6.<br>  <br>  By the way, the Wikipedia page makes no mention of this season airing in March. The only thing happening in March is that Lifetime is set to appeal the decision disallowing it to air the episodes. If the appeal is denied, the episodes will not begin to air. If the appeal is accepted they may begin airing them shortly after.|`|ahDBFy8Haa	its being delayed till mid march. www.en.wikipedia.org/Project Runway|`|AA11238814	it'll start in march on wednesdays at nine o clock pm

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	First of all, don't paint your room deep purple! You will regret it later. Remember when you were into (fill in name of music group or actor here) and then a time came where you were no longer into it? Well that's exactly what will happen with your bedroom. I know, because when I was little I wanted a flamingo pink room, and well, my aunt actually went for the idea, and painted the room flamingo pink! I regretted it, almost as soon as the color was on the wall. And now, it would take loads of primer just to cover the color enough to be able to repaint the walls. To this day, whenever I go back east to visit my aunts house, the room is still flamingo pink because no one wants to try to attempt to paint over the color. Deep purple is about like trying to paint over black, it takes A LOT of work.<br>  <br>  There are ways to color your room without painting the walls. You can get a zebra print border for your room and run it along the center of your wall, or along the ceiling. You can get a deep purple comforter for your bed, zebra print sheets, and zebra throw pillows for your bed. You can get a throw rug at Walmart in deep purple for your room. Keep the big things (comforter, furniture, etc) in the solid color like purple or silver (which goes well with purple) and keep the accents like trash can and pillows in zebra print so you don't have to redo the whole room when you get tired of the zebra print. <br>  <br>  Have fun, and get your parents permission before you start changing your room around. It may be your room, but it is their house!|`|6359LQLNaa	don't get a pattern on your wall, because you will get sick of it<br>  paint your room a light color so that your room will look bigger, and then get a bed spread to match it (go crazy with bed spreads because you can just throw them away if you don't like them anymore)<br>  <br>  i got my room painted light green in 3rd grade and i had flowers everywhere too<br>  but i got sick of the flowers so freshman year i got a new bed spread that matched my walls and i'm still using it and i love it

6DszSDt4aa	DO NOT:<br>  1. Frequently use heat tools, as this contributes to split ends.<br>  If you must use heat tools (I know, I'm addicted too) try to use them less frequently and with heat pprotectant. One trick to use less heat tools is to curl a few random sections. It looks great yet you don't damage your whole head.<br>  2. Brush wet hair. It damages your hair leaving it frizzy and with split ends. If possible, only brush with boar-bristles, because they are softer and help create shine.<br>  3. Cut hair with scissors not meant for hair. I tried this, and its my biggest hair mistake. (worse than straightening everyday!) It caused the worst split ends that I have ever seen, not to mention tons of frizz!<br>  <br>  DO:<br>  1. Get a trim every 6 weeks to prevent split ends. However, this may get pricey, so make sure to at least trim it once every 2-3 months.<br>  2. Deep condition. Pantene makes a great one, and so does Aussie. If you don't want to buy anything, try using coconut oil. It smells great and makes hair super soft and shiny.<br>  3. Eat right and drink water. Protein and water are said to keep hair soft and shiny while helping it grow.<br>  4. Massage your scalp daily. I've read massaging your scalp for 2 minutes everyday helps stimulate hair growth. I'm not sure if it's a myth, but it couldn't hurt!<br>  5. Be patient! On average, hair grows 0.5 inches every month. This means your hair probably won't grow longer than 6 inches in one year. So be patient and learn to love your shorter hair.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|8x0oe23aaa	MILK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XKoYg5Whaa	vitamin B|`|upGeUPjNaa	There is a shampoo that is very cheap called Mane & Tail or its also called Horse shampoo as a common name!

It is usually about $25.<br>  <br>  6) THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT:<br>  TRIM EVERY 4-6 WEEKS. If you think that your stylist is scissor-happy, make a family member who knows how to cut hair trim your hair to ensure that they will just trim your hair and not cut it. (Trust me I have had bad experiences with hair cutters in the salon.) This is important because it cuts of the dead ends/ split ends. I suggest triming every 5 weeks. <br>  <br>  7) Remember, you won't see a dramatic change until 2-3 months. Hair grows 1/2-1 inch every month depending on its health. <br>  Good luck and HAPPY GROWING!|`|YaiqCrVGaa	look into hair products and shampoos that help with making your hair stronger, hydrated, and they might make a product that helps it grow faster too.

W8hAlZaaaa	Oh this is a super simple question. Just wash your hair. Then you might want to add some grease around your head so the dye doesn't drip. You don't really have to. Mix like 4 packages of cool aid with some conditioner enough to cover your whole head. The Kool-aid conditioner should be really really red. Now really mix the conditioner in your hair. and leave it in for a really long time. The longer you leave it in the darker the red. i would suggest wearing a shower cap all day. Its really uncomfortable to sleep in so you might want to do it in the morning and leave it in all day. Then Just rinse it out and re wash you hair in cold water.|`|XqzPkogaaa	Koolaid??<br>  O_o|`|c2wXk6ntaa	Are you krazy i think you are|`|g9b0lUnNaa	lol|`|leKPLpHcaa	Straight up, honestly- I don't recommend it. If you want something to last for a day, then go for it. Since your hair is black, you'll get maybe a tint of it. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend just dying your hair red. If you don't bleach it, you'll get a hint of red in the sunlight which will look pretty cool. Black hair isn't going to turn fire red without bleaching it, and if you do bleach it, it's going to take a long time and hurt your scalp and make your hair dry. It might be cool to highlight your hair with a lighter brown and then just dye all of your hair red. That way you'll see red highlights but have a all over red tint.<br>  <br>  I recommend Manic Panic over anything. That stuff is bright, strong and it lasts. They have an awesome red color, too. You can find it at Hot Topic or Sally's Beauty Supply. Good luck!|`|1iZN6ILMaa	color dyes and things like koolaid deposit color, you cant see the color if its being deposited on already dark hair, its like coloring a black paper with a red marker, it doesnt show up, you need to lighten to see color.|`|xPn4ydFKaa	LMAO......u retard!!!....clorox would do good!!!...try it!!...|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	If you want it to be bright red, you'll HAVE to bleach it first.<br>  <br>  If you just do the koolaid it won't show.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	the red will not show up in your hair what so ever if your hair is the color you described.<br>  the only way you can make your hair bright red is to bleach it, which you don't want to do.<br>  so your kinda out of luck. sorry.

i38Ev1Zaaa	try to stay away from the Wet2Straight irons- they tend to fry your hair.<br>  <br>  the best hair straightener varies to the texture of your hair.<br>  <br>  A lot of people say CHI is the best, but i think differently- they're mass produced, so quite a few of them are defective- they break easily, and a lot of cords malfunctioned.<br>  <br>  My favorites are FHI, Sedu, and Solia.<br>  <br>  The Solia is great because its more affordable than the other straighteners, but they still offer a high quality iron. They're tourmaline cermaic, so they don't fry your hair, and they heat up evenly and quickly for long lasting, and fast results. One of my favorite things about this iron is that its a single duty iron. Alot of the curl/straighten irons leave your ends flat when you curl your hair, or your ends flipped when you straighten your hair-s omething i don't like:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1558.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1...</a><br>  <br>  The FHI is really similar to the Solia- its a great iron, and it also makes pretty nice beachy waves when you want it to. The regular FHI's work better on thin hair, while the FHI Platform works better on thicker hair:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/FHI_Ceramic_Tec_d1845.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/FHI_Ceramic_Tec_d1...</a><br>  <br>  The Sedu is the most expensive out of the three. If you like the CHI irons, but want something more durable, the SEDU is the iron for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Sedu_Revolution_d2880.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Sedu_Revolution_d2...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Before you spend that money on a straightener, visit your hair stylist and ask them their opinion- since they know your hair, they should be able to tell you which iron will work the best on your hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qqptguPJaa	The Chi or Forever<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I own Wet2Dry its works good but <br>  <br>  <br>  the above work even better my sister<br>  <br>  owns Forever and it works awsome<br>  <br>  it straightens and you can curl your hair too..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Chi straightens hair really good<br>  <br>  but too expensive.|`|bO3W5whVaa	ghd all the way!

txDbluVwaa	WRONG SECTION!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  But still......<br>  <br>  There's many examples in this regard but I'll just focus on two examples. The goal of homeostasis in the reproductive system would be to ensure optimal conditions for fertility.<br>  <br>  For men, one such regulated factor is testis temperature. Generally the optimal temperature for production and storage sperm is 1-2 degrees C lower than body temperature. Therefore on cold days, or during swimming in the morning sea etc the testes will retract closer to the body (aka shrinkage that all guys know about) to prevent excessively. Conversely on a hot day (or after a warm shower/bath) then it tends to be hanging more loosely to prevent excessive heating, which will affect sperm motility. This is also why prolonged saunas and hot baths are not recommended for those wanting to be dads.|`|IW0p51tIaa	Why do u want to noe i dnt noe though!!

Like, put your hair in two ponies and then go down about an inch or so and put another band in, repeating the process.  if you want to mix it up a bit, put in multiple colors!<br>  *CURL IT<br>    wash your hair the night before and then put a little gel in each piece as you put your whole head in curlers.  repeat the process until you have a full head of curlers<br>  *TWO FRENCH BRAIDS<br>    you can put your hair in the french braids.  if you can't do it, than ask your mom to.  heck, i still do! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  also, you can mix up your everyday styles by putting in colored or patterned clips or headbands.  if you want to do those thin sports headbands, then secure them in with bobby pins.  i hope i helped!!  can you PLEASE help me answer my question?!?!?!?!?!  thanks!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjglGttmMakxpDIEzjTcQ2bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112933AAoW9Po">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|EhrB7nUXaa	<a href="http://www.DailyMakeover.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DailyMakeover.com</a><br>  <br>  thats a pretty good hair style website.

I also think that it doesn't mean a man is gay - most women wear jeans, and the notion that only gay women wear jeans is preposterous.

QdbKtBHwaa	personally i love jeans, but thats just me. I have a best friend who also hates them. Sometimes jeans can be itchy and uncomfortable. And I agree with you to many they are boring and plain, because everyone wears them. Then again a lot of people wear them for other reasons than just fitting in. For me a dark jean is a good backdrop for a flouncy top, or a graphic tee, and if you really find the right style for yourself, and if you make sure that they are comfortable, than you will find that they are not so bad. I think its fine that you don't like jeans. It just makes you more unique than the rest!|`|l8HTrNyIaa	Jeans are not uncomfortable after you break them it. Some people can look very good in jeans actually, and they don't have to look boring. Put them with a cool shirt, the right accesorries and shoes, and you have a pretty good outfit. You dont have to wear them every day, and there are different styles that look good.|`|g086JEmZaa	I like the way they look but I don't find them to be that comfortable either.|`|j51RT5vAaa	omg jeans are all i WEAR! they're my life for school~!

TCpTlCTRaa	Aromatherapy scalp massage with essential oils is a very effective to regrow hair in bald patches. Essential oil applied to the scalp will increase the blood supply to the are it was applied. This increased blood supply brings nourishment and energy to the follicles, helping to stimulate new hair growth.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies.

sJZXhPxyaa	what!? that sounds ridiculous.  just make sure you rinse the conditioner out.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	It depends what type of conditioner you use. The key word hear is natural ingredients. Avoid conditioners that contain alcohol which will dry up and damage your hair. Look for conditioners that contain natural oils such as coconut oil, aloe vera, and tea tree oil, all of which will help condition, moisturize, and strengthen your hair, leaving it longer, stronger, and healthier. Conditioning your hair will not make your hair fall out, unless you are using a strong, chemical based, deep condition, which actually could be dangerous for your hair in the long run. Stick with all natural products whenever possible, and don't believe everything that you hear!|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No, It doesn't...Conditioner has nothing to do with hair loss. It's good to conditioner your hair, as it makes your hair soft, and easier to manage...Always condition your hair.|`|bHgWAFcaaa	You should condition your hair 3-4 times a week maximum.
Z0odTlyQaa	No- and I'm a fan of dreadlocks|`|sSBGuwJjaa	FAIL.|`|tCBcAhUGaa	no dreads look disgusting and you have to shave your head if you ever want to get rid of them. they are the most distugsting things in the world. plus they gt full of dirt and crap. and if you ever wanted a joob they are a BIG turn off|`|o0mwF5kFaa	LOL. I think you really meant to ask if you should corn-row/plait your hair. Dreads are the rats thing that's really gross and disgusting. If you think twists/corn-row/plaits would look good on you then go ahead, I guess.<br>  ==|`|V4FQzI1Taa	If you want to, I have seen a few people that pull off the dread look very well. But I think a full head looks much better.|`|5CVjlklZaa	I think dreads look gross|`|eWwNRKtiaa	i really think dreads look gross, but if you have the right look they might look okay. i really dont understand the point of making your head a big knot ball, but if its the style you like, and you have the right accesories to go along with it, go ahead!|`|wZcFWBrOaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.<br>  <br>  in my opinion dreads are extremely ugly.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer my questions<br>  :<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj.oIy1xhq9bbVQYyVB8HQTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112057AAdc2yj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjnWa1_Uv41dXWGYUJegmO7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222113657AASfKJF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NixLMYGDaa	dont dread ur hair at all!!!!! it looks soooo bad!! everyone will think you look wierd.... and it will be true!!!
Z0odTlyQaa	Well obviously extensions would probably be the best suggestion, but I have also heard of girls taking pre-natal vitamins to encourage hair and nail growth.|`|kknSPYxKaa	For anyone that says to use olive oil in your hair, don't do it.<br>  I used it a long time ago and it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life!<br>  I practically had to live in the shower when I used it, it was so greasy afterward, and there was no way to get the olive oil out.<br>  It was like, I really don't know how to explain it, but it was gross.<br>  If you don't believe me, get a little bit of olive oil and try it on a small portion of your hair, it will feel like your just soaking your hair in it, and it will be hard to get out.<br>  <br>  To make your hair grow faster, I use Mane N' Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.<br>  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or most CVS's for about 5 or 6 dollars a bottle, depending on where you buy it at.<br>  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my hair has already grown around 2 inches.<br>  It is horse shampoo, but it can be used on humans too. So no worries there. It makes your hair thicker, shinier, softer, more manageable, and best of all, it makes your hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  Aussie 3 minute miracle is a great deep conditioner.  Best one I have used out there.  It should make your hair grow faster.  When I used it it made my hair grow like a weed!  It goes for about 4 dollars.<br>  <br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS:<br>  Flip your hair over at least 3 times a day, to get the blood flowing.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  Get regular trims.(every 6-8 weeks)<br>  <br>  Try to keep heat away from your hair, if you can't use a heat protector.<br>  <br>  Massage your scalp for 2-3 minutes each day.<br>  <br>  Prenatal pills are good for your skin hair and nails. They contain everything you should need to make your hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  Eat things with lots of iron and protien.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope I helped :D|`|Twq7efhQaa	The best tip i can give you is to take vitamins however these need to be pre-natal vitamns as they make your hair and nails grow faster. This is also a good site for tips: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simpsonwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/ashlee-hair1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpsonwatch.com/wp-content/u...</a>|`|6DszSDt4aa	DO NOT:<br>  1. Frequently use heat tools, as this contributes to split ends.<br>  If you must use heat tools (I know, I'm addicted too) try to use them less frequently and with heat pprotectant. One trick to use less heat tools is to curl a few random sections. It looks great yet you don't damage your whole head.<br>  2. Brush wet hair. It damages your hair leaving it frizzy and with split ends. If possible, only brush with boar-bristles, because they are softer and help create shine.<br>  3. Cut hair with scissors not meant for hair. I tried this, and its my biggest hair mistake. (worse than straightening everyday!) It caused the worst split ends that I have ever seen, not to mention tons of frizz!<br>  <br>  DO:<br>  1. Get a trim every 6 weeks to prevent split ends. However, this may get pricey, so make sure to at least trim it once every 2-3 months.<br>  2. Deep condition. Pantene makes a great one, and so does Aussie. If you don't want to buy anything, try using coconut oil. It smells great and makes hair super soft and shiny.<br>  3. Eat right and drink water. Protein and water are said to keep hair soft and shiny while helping it grow.<br>  4. Massage your scalp daily. I've read massaging your scalp for 2 minutes everyday helps stimulate hair growth. I'm not sure if it's a myth, but it couldn't hurt!<br>  5. Be patient! On average, hair grows 0.5 inches every month. This means your hair probably won't grow longer than 6 inches in one year. So be patient and learn to love your shorter hair.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|QRbCnBgFaa	Here are a few hair extension links...<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enchantedlocks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.enchantedlocks.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapunzelsecret.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rapunzelsecret.com/</a><br>  <br>  I took my time to find really good sites for tips on growing hair...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip214.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip214....</a><br>  (really good tips)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Hair-Grow-Faster" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Hair-Gr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip180018.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip1800...</a><br>  <br>  Hey, i hope i helped. :-)<br>  <br>  x x|`|89rEHJm0aa	wow i want to see a pic of this lololol|`|IjRDmz2Vaa	I would buy clip in hair extensions.

You always get hot at parties. You could go with either heels or flats. Heels are definitely sexier, but flats are a lot more functional. If you have straight hair, maybe curl it, and if you have curly hair, straighten it. Just switch it up a bit. I like doing the "poof" thing because it keeps the hair out of my face and looks cute. For makeup just keep it simple, don't over do it. Maybe some foundation and blush with mascara & some extra eyeshadow or eyeliner to enhance your eye more than usual. Have fun :)|`|ppBYeYG9aa	Well it depends what your style is... but i personally think jeans are your best bet.

(Of course this wouldn't occur until after you learn how to spell and type.)|`|Y0O6971laa	You sound really annoying.

"Ehmagawd i am NAWT ah-nnoying! im rich, hawt, popular, and stylish." and i agree with the other people no one cares what mommy and daddy buy you, YOU are not rich, you PARENTS might be, but YOU aren't.

51lPwFuJaa	Try to pick something with straps or a halter, it will make your bust look bigger. Strapless will constantly keep falling down and make you look super flat if you have a tiny waist too. <br>  <br>  Try to pick something that wont overwhelm you, probably likely a above the knee dress with some heels. <br>  <br>  or if you want to go longer pick something that is very flowy and soft makes you look more taller/streamline.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Yes I had this same exact problem with I was young, I was exactly the same size as you and it is hard to find clothes. <br>  <br>  I like the first one listed below and it comes in a size 3 and even that might be too big for you but it might work.<br>  <br>  The second one also comes in a size 3-4.  If it is too big you could always find a seamstress to alter it for you.  <br>  <br>  The yellow one also comes in a size 3-4.<br>  <br>  Second yellow dress says it comes in small and you would have to find out if it would fit you first.<br>  <br>  The dress at 4prom.com comes in a size 0 and a size 2 but it is a little more expensive.  <br>  <br>  The pink dress at 4prom.com also comes in light blue and it on sale for $99.00 and comes in a size 2.|`|8dff71abc395c19562c5566bc59244deaa	a short dress would "elongate your petite frame", any neckline would suit you and "choose a prom dress with a strong waist detail to bring the focus to your tiny torso"<br>  hope that helps :)|`|PTWjkYu8aa	wear a brown or red dress it would look cute|`|Vp3FklU2aa	and how old are you may i ask cause my little sister is 4.7 and she is 73|`|afedCNrlaa	Whatever you do don't where a black dress.

IwJ7fDDwaa	I use MAC Studio fix. It's the powder and goes on really smooth after I put a little lotion on my face. It perfectly covers my flaws and it's not really noticeable at all I'm wearing make-up. I'm not sure about Studio Tech. I know what you're referring to, I've just never used it. I know Studio Fix is cheaper at approx. 27 dollars. I hope it works out for you!<br>  <3|`|xm4E3Epaaa	urmmm...<br>  its between the MAC Mineralize Satinfinish, and the MAC Studio sculpt,<br>  the coverage is totally buildable, and creamy and like..amazing with the Studio sculpt, and i just LOVE the light reflecting minerals in the satin finish<br>  -i just like sparkles/glitter.<br>  obvs i love the coverage etc but yeah....glitter :)<br>  xxx|`|J9Vmueauaa	Mac is good, but it cakes easily, so don't wear it too much.<br>  also, it might make you breakout a little.<br>  <br>  clinique is great, because its very light weight and makes the skin look flawwwwwless :)|`|F1iNEWN4aa	I looove Makeup Forever HD liquid foundation.

SXm75cZtaa	Well, I've had Covergirl Lashblast waterproof and it was clumpy at first, but then I only added two coats and it wasn't clump like it had been before. Also, I say, unless its summer and you are constantly swimming, you should use the regular kind of and mascarra only because the reason waterproof doesnt smudge and run is because it dries out your lashes, so only use waterproof if you have to.<br>  I hope I helped?|`|lMOudbdTaa	please answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0ovb5xj4Eq454KBK.Nq30Oxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222162956AAObXEL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|cW6kkcV1aa	Hiii :]<br>  <br>  Mmkay, I, myself, use the regular LashBlash Mascara and it doesn't run or smudge, and it is definitely alot less clumpy than the Waterproof kind. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend it :]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you! <br>  <br>  - ?Jess|`|go6sqAtKaa	I have allergies so I got the waterproof,but the bad thing about the waterproof is that it's sooooo freaking hard to remove it,but I use baby oil to get it off and it works like a charm. So if you don't have allergies n such then I suggest u get the regular.
bAYVSfdJaa	It's legit.  It doesn't mean you can't dye your hair, you're just going to want to do a test patch on you arm or something to make sure you don't have a reaction.  <br>  <br>  I have no idea what tattoos & hair dye have to do with each other, something with the chemicals in the dye, I think.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I agree with A Silent Reminder - do a patch test first because you do have an increased chance of having a reaction to the dye if you have a tattoo. I personally have never had a problem, but you'd better be safe and just do a patch test. <br>  <br>  The chemicals in the tattoo ink can cause mild allergic reactions on their own, so mild you may not even know they are happening. Add the chemicals from the hair dye on top of the underlying mild allergic reaction and you could get more severe allergic reaction.|`|d9B4EVFxaa	because of some of the ingredients in the tattoo ink some people become more sensitive to the iingredients in the hair color product! You should mix a small amount of the product and do a patch test (place a small dab of the product behind the ear or inner side of the elbow) 24-48 hours prior to coloring your hair! I have never met someone who wasn't allergic pre tattoo and then allergic post tattoo... But it better to be safe than sorry!!|`|ss48BEk5aa	I have a tattoo on my head and one on my neck and I dye my hair like crazy. You should be okay. Do the allergy test to make sure.|`|Opz3o8Boaa	No - I think that is for new tattoos that are in an area to be dyed.|`|nKruEEuhaa	Are you highlighting or bleaching your hair on your head or on your body? <br>  <br>  If you are coloring your hair, it won't effect your tattoos, unless of course you have a tattoo on your head, mostly highlights are bleach so if you are putting bleach on your skin it could possibly lighten the ink in your tattoo. And putting bleach directly on skin alone is irritating, so maybe the presence of tattoo ink could cause a reaction.|`|4e32757c6602dc28699abde7b9ffb05baa	I got a tattoo 8 years ago.... been dying my hair for most of my life- never had a problem at all. I've gotten it done professionally and done at home by a box myself. Good luck! Hair dye and Tattoos are both addictive, once you start, its hard to stop!! :)|`|20f972ecd85bf2fac27701cc8e64fb48aa	i'm moderately heavily tattooed and have never had a problem with hair dye. *knock on wood* i would recommend doing a test patch first the first time you use a brand.|`|lezq1eiEaa	I guess it all depends on your skin type and tolerance!

I've never really had long hair, so I have a couple of suggestions. Luckily, I have time to grow my hair out before my wedding- But here's what I would do. Go to Claire's or a similar accessory type store and find a cute headband that goes with the jewelry that you're going to wear. Take it to the salon and have them style your hair around the headband. Another idea is incorporating flowers in to your hairdo. I used silk (fake) daisies when I was a senior in high school and had a bright yellow dress. If you're not planning on going to a hairdresser- I would just do it a little funky at home using a bunch of little clips- there are so many ideas out there. I'm sure you will look beautiful at Prom- and Thanks for donating to Locks of Love- its such a great organization!

Asrxi2ZQaa	yes i have a rather big toosh and i find it very comfortable to sit on. Sometimes it can be uncomfy but yes i do think there is some truth to that. :)|`|37E2yPGjaa	I'm not really sure, because my but has always been kina big compared to the rest of my body lol. I would imagine there is some truth to that though, because the but is the most cushioned place on your body. The bigger but u have, the more cushion right? im guessing so. lol :] hope i helped|`|gHT2ZPkFaa	lol Im a petite girl with a bigger booty and I've never thought about this. I would imagine people with less fat or muscle there would be sitting closer to the bone. I think this might be true to a certain degree, but there probably isnt a whole lot of a difference.|`|NV2Y7b0naa	lol girl chill!!! i have a really big, bubbly butt 2 and it does feel like cushion lol. its a good thing cuz than ur butt isnt bonny and it doest hurt hehe
y96eYj0Faa	Yeah guys LOVE vanilla. Trust me.

zg3xB2Y4aa	yes! your very pretty and you look like the type of person that just suits a nose piercing. :)|`|H9DY3ElFaa	I dont know. I think it would be OK. Most of the time the nose ring works. Well, im not sure how your mom is, but to get your belly done tell her, its not on your face so it not as noticable.|`|xJ2kcJsraa	dont.....piercings are ugly as sh!t...to be honest...you're gonna regret it later.<br>  <br>  i dunno...up to you raelly...but you asked for my opinion and there it is.|`|gc94glPvaa	definitely|`|GnBabSJ5aa	ya you would|`|tidw3kY5aa	i think that u should beg and get all A's and stop yelling at her all the time, and convince her u dont know this 'pat' whom she speaks of, and get ur belly button peirced, then get a six pck. (or get one b4) so it looks awesmazing. ur so close to getting one anyways. u would look ok with a nose peircing, but itd be cooler if ur mom let u get like ur lip or eyebrow peirced instead cuz i think itd look better. : ]|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Yeah but you would be okay with a smaller stud.|`|Y98trMtkaa	Get your nose pierced for sure !!<br>  It would look amazing !<br>  my mom right now isnt letting me get my bellybutton or nose. Im not to convinced on getting my nose because she thinks facial piercings make a person look tacky and it defaces them. I think to many facial ones starts getting gross but nose looks good on id say most girls i havent seen one of my friends that it does not look good on and about 5 of mine have it done. I also want my bellybutton pierced way more then nose but my mom just wont let me and its extremely hard to convince my parents.My mom also wont let me get my cartilage done she thinks i will get a brain infection HAHA. but get the nose for sure. and belly button piercings looks cute on basically everyone unless you are completely out of shape and fat :P , no offense to anyone. hope i helped. good luck on convincing your mom (:|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	like someone else said, it would look OK, not gorgeous. but it won't look bad.<br>  and just be thankful for now that your mom is letting you get this piercing at all. <br>  i have my nose pierced, 4 holes in my ears and i'm getting an industrial.<br>  <br>  if you have any piercing questions or questions about the nose piercing, just email me (:|`|1mALLE4Gaa	tell "her" that it will make YOU feel better about yourself. but only say that if you mean it. if you're getting one just to be cool.. save us all the headaches and forget about it. and honestly.. i don't know why you're turning to yahoo for piercing questions. if you want one.. get one. don't base it on if you look hott or not.|`|fr9x3db1aa	i think a nose piercing would look fine on you! <br>  & if you dont like it you can always take it out
mhyL7Qw3aa	Use a foundation that has moisturizing qualities in them, like emollients. You might not me moisturizing right. What you do is take your pointer and middle finger and tap on your moisturizer instead of rubbing it in. This gives your skin more moisturizer to soak in. You will notice a big difference when you are applying your foundation.|`|Drg3bLjUaa	I think you are using the wrong moisturiser or not enough...after applying your moisturiser give yourself 5 mins or so to let the product soak into your skin...after this time you will know if you need some more product by touching your skin...make sure you drink plenty water to keep your skin hydrated too :)<br>  <br>  to avoid a shiny effect you should use an oil free moisturiser|`|ajgpWfMMaa	Instead of smothering your face in moisturizer you should try and get a skin care routine working for dry skin, morning and night. It will help to treat your dry skin. Try Dermalogica, they have a variety of different products to suit your skin using their facemapping. <br>  Also have you considered changing your moisturizer? E45 is a brilliant moisturizer, I recommend it. Try using a lot of it overnight so that your skin can soak the moisture all up instead of going to school looking like you have sunscreen on your face. ;)<br>  <br>  M xx|`|xuSHX9GLaa	try using a concealer. then try using a powder foundation or a bronzer.
ydYi0lu2aa	Oh my yes you can! I suggest using a darker color because it doesn't show as much as it begins to chip and flake. I've done this many times and it always comes out great!|`|TF7gdNPvaa	LOL...no.Let me give you an example.If you put that on your hair and it drys.Let's just say if u try to pull it down it'll break off.lol.PLus your hair will fall out.Are you feeling okay?Did you have anything to drink?Did you smoke anything?I'm just curious.A question like this makes me very curious|`|zZrKhn9eaa	Sure! The sky is the limit!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh... and now's probably a good time to stop sniffing the nail polish :P|`|GHlYbDfJaa	No.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Um, no.

Protect the skin with a non irritating lotion.<br>  <br>  Ideally wash your face with plain water in the AM. Apply a sensitive skin moisturizer like Cetaphil. Allow it to absorb then apply makeup. Avoid powders if you skin is dry, stick to creamy formulas.<br>  <br>  Pat on lotion during the day if your face when your face feels tight.<br>  <br>  PM, apply cold cream to face, allow to sit 1 minute and tissue off with cotton circles. Splash face with lukewarm water, pat dry. Apply night moisturizer.

sOO93u5Oaa	Every person has different hair, maybe it's just the way her hair is. You could try different shampoos and conditioners, and also they have this clear dye stuff I've used before that makes your hair glossy. I can't remember what it's called though, sorry. You could also try only washing your hair every other day or so, since washing your hair everyday is bad, because it takes out the natural oils your hair needs. Also, getting regular trims and not dying your hair so much or using heating tools such as blowdryers, straighteners, curling irons, etc. will keep your hair looking healthy and beautiful!

hD708JXMaa	Oily Hair?<br>  <br>  Oily hair is most often the result of over-active sebaceous glands in the follicle pores. Sebum (hair oil) is there for a reason - to help coat, protect and nourish. They generally are increasingly active during warmer weather and can be irritated, inflammed and clogged without proper cleansing.<br>  <br>  Though it is believe heredity plays a prominent role in excess sebum, it is possible to help regulate oil production and improve the cleanliness (and improve the appearance) of your hair with the right hair products.<br>  <br>  The Best Shampoo for Oily Hair - What to look for<br>  <br>  The best shampoos for oily hair we have reviewed contain Zinc PCA. Zinc PCA is a complex that is known to help regulate the sebaceous glands, thereby reducing oil production. Accumulation of oil on the scalp can harbor bacteria bacteria, facilitate fungus and cling to dirt and clog pores. The result can be saclp acne and bumps, itching, inflammation and flaking. Zinc PCA slows oil accumulation and production without irritation or harming the scalp.<br>  <br>  Herbal or botanical active ingredients are often combined with Zinc to provide natural deep-cleaning. While heredity seems to be the genesis for active sebaceous glands, harsh chemicals and cleansers can activate and irritate the scalp - leading to increased scalp problems and poor scalp health. Herbal ingredients have been shown to be effective at cleansing while providing nourishment to maximize the scalp and follicles' well-being.<br>  <br>  Finding the best shampoo for oily hair can be well worth the effort. Various formulations provide oil regulation and can simultaneously provide body and volume. Regardless of your hair style, a deep cleaning shampoo that targets oiliness can give you healthy, more attractive hair.<br>  <br>  Nioxin is a basic line of products that actually will prevent future hair loss and will help maintain what you have. Also it will help bring back hair if the follicel is dormat. Nioxin is a great product. They have shampoos and conditioner also treatments for the scalp for more aggressive hairloss. Although a majority of my clients i see with the same problem I usually will see if they have thyroid problem. Thyroid problems are the major cause of hair loss in women.<br>  <br>  Maybe you have a thyroid problem S.C heres a link to help <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/thyroid_problems/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/thyroid_p...</a>|`|tIPiGkKtaa	try john freida moisture shampoo and conditioner.|`|Y4ATEWCdaa	For oily hair a cheap shampoo like suave seems to work. Weird, I know, but it really cuts through the grease and dirt. Then perhaps use the same conditioner. I don't know for sure if this will help, but good luck.|`|9QSGivGNaa	i wouldn't use deep conditioning for oily hair. only dry damaged hair needs conditioning. i kno that garnier fructis is good 4 building strength in hair, so i would just switch 2 another line of it

jWmnSXlLaa	I agree it is called smokey eye and tons of good videos on it on youtube. Check them out. Her hair is just curled at the bottom. Seems like a fairly simple look.|`|2daH8Dh4aa	well her makeup is pretty much the smokey eye (search on youtube how to do smokey eye tutorials)|`|8a8ace59cecea83fa01b9dcaaf5a819aaa	her hair is hard. Trust me i tried. You should get front bangs and layers. Her makeup is a smokey eye. Which requires some eyeliner and grey shadow.
gHT2ZPkFaa	Just tell your mom if you can get some makeup and show her the website. A lot of known companies (like elf) have secure websites. I shop online and I have never had a problem. Show her what you want and let her type in the credit card information. She'll probably be more comfortable if shes the one doing it.
ajn28YFWaa	fix the part and if they dont stay. then  wet them and bobby pin them so they learn to go that way|`|DVAhtK1raa	Move your parting far over to the side (your choice to which side) and allow the bangs to sweep across..|`|ReDarchbaa	I'd say go to a hair salon and get them to do it. I don't know how exactly they do it, but every time I get my bangs side swept they use the razor to do it. I don't think scissors have the same effect as the razor. But I'm no hair expert. Lol.|`|HlMkLn0gaa	first you need to grouw them out ant then cut them but do not go to short.
LBHJaqXoaa	I have been to 3 different tattoo artists and they all said the same thing... to use A&D ointment (nappy rash cream) and after a few days switch to a moisturizer that's aloe free, scent free, and dye free. I use Curel Ultra Healing lotion because it's heavy and lasts a long time. My tattoos all look bright and vibrant, just like the day I got it. <br>  <br>  Go ahead and switch to a good moisturizer now.|`|BzbCgFGMaa	To tell you the truth you should listen to your tattoo artist.<br>  <br>  Although my Tattoo artist told me to use Bepanthen which is a nappy rash cream he said its the best and don't listening to what anyone else tells me if i use this my tattoo wont scab.<br>  <br>  And it didn't scab it only bruised a tiny bit for about a day or two only thing i had to go through was the itchy period which was hell cause i couldn't scratch it loll|`|7n523JW1aa	No you should listen to your tattoo artist. Use the cream for the correct amount of day and then use moisturiser. He's right. If the scabbing and bruising doesn't go away 12 days after you got it then go back and tell him. He should take care of it.|`|z31qxJijaa	Vaseline|`|jUyAoQ63aa	Each Tattoo artist heals there work differently, It depends on what kind of ink is used, and What they have experienced. I co own a shop and Our shop Uses tat wax, (its not as greasy as A&D) Also You can Use Aquaphor  We have our clients use a VERY thin layer for two weeks. But after about 3 days you can switch to a Non scented Non Aloe lotion,Lubriderm works great! make sure you are still gently washing the tattoo for the first week, especially if there is alot of color in it. BUt relax you are doing everything your artist wants you too!|`|PBMg4OTMaa	I've used different things for my tattoos and I find that some tattoo artists know more than others.<br>  My first tattoo artist told me to use Tattoo Goo which made the tattoos scab badly and they didn't heal very well.<br>  My new one told me to use nappy rash cream and I really do swear by it. I usually use it for a week or two and by that time the tattoo has healed. But if you feel more comfortable using the moisturiser go for it! Especially if your tattoo artist told you to.|`|vveMFK01aa	i got a new tat and i used bepanthen as did hubby (that was what tat artist said to use) it was really good my small tat healed within 5 days just a little scabby in the middle and hubbys large one healed in 8-10 day's <br>  <br>  if you don't know bepanthen is a nappy rash creame but a new kind it leaves a water tight barrier while letting skin breathe HTH|`|QiyoWDInaa	just keep covering it in bepathin nappy rash cream, will be ok after a week|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	i use savlon or germoline all the way thru the healing process but that's what my tattooist told and after 3 they have all came out fine Xxx|`|vDky5V15aa	I use aquaphor on all of my tattoos. About 10 days twice a day. Then I switch to Curel unscented lotion until it has completely healed. <br>  <br>  But you should listen to your artist. They are the ones who will service any problems you have in the healing process. I am kind of concerned about the bruising as I have never been bruised during a tattoo. That seems odd to me. <br>  <br>  If you are still bruised after a couple of weeks, you should consult you doctor. That could be an indication of a more serious problem.

AhcVDCaVaa	:O i love your new hair!!! :D<br>  i think the old one is a little funky looking, to be honest<br>  but that's just my opinion<br>  for your hair, you can actually just lighten it with some lemon juice :D it'll look reallly pretty, and you can choose where you want it lighter<br>  <br>  <br>  as for a hair cut... <br>  <a href="http://styletips101.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://styletips101.com/wp-content/uploa...</a> ?<br>  or<br>  <a href="http://haircut-styles.info/2008/05/haircut-styles-with-bangs-in-2008/" rel="nofollow">http://haircut-styles.info/2008/05/hairc...</a><br>  these styles?<br>  <br>  they certainly are different :D <br>  hope this helped!|`|11QzdN87aa	i think that if your going to color it, leave the allover the color it is now, and get highlights or dye the underneath, like.. get a color not just blond or just black like blue or green or something.. and also warning colors like blue and green fade to a nasty color so something like purple (i have purple=]) might work better.. <br>  and just experiment with styles, when you get bored.. and look up tutorials on youtube on hairstyles for your hair type and length<br>  <br>  thats where i get all my hairstyle ideas that or i just experiment<br>  <br>  youve got nice hair so it should be easy to work with|`|bgdjtJepaa	personally i think your hair is adorable at the moment.  it looked good long as well though.  if you dye it, you will need to get the dead ends cut off again, or else your hair will more than likely seem as if it isn't growing.  use a deep conditioner  to keep your hair healthy and it should get longer faster.|`|U9QSOLUtaa	Personally, I think you look much prettier with your hair shorter and your bangs like the last picture. If you wanted to mix it up a little, you could get some caramel color highlights, or for a little more edge, some deep red. There really is no magic trick for speeding hair growth, so until then, keep rocking the hair you have.|`|snsbrXrnaa	i think you just need to decide whats better. long hair.. or dyed hair... cause if you dye it its going to get damaged making it harder to grow it out. im wanting to grow mine out and dye it and im chosing to wait for it to grow out before dying it|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well i think your hair look's better now that look's cute keep it that way|`|pyeMna2Caa	OHHHHHH<br>  <br>  BOTH WAYS i love your haircut:D|`|ajn28YFWaa	try a burgundy.it will look very good on u. =)|`|WpPeydNaaa	i like it both ways!<br>  trust me the short hair works<br>  i love it(:|`|s2drWdMkaa	its cute now but u could put some blonde streakks or small chunks in it.|`|dF08mbFyaa	your new hair looks gorgeous. if i were you, i would get lowlights (basically darker streaks). if you wanted to do something with a crazy color, i would do a purple streak on one side. also, i had hair longer than yours, similar style and then cut it so that it is like yours now. don't grow it. at first i HATED it, but it looks so much better and your hair looks so much thicker! it also enhances your face shape. recently, i told my friends I was going to grow my hair back (I was kinda tired of the shorter hair, ya know?) and guess what, EVERY person I asked said "No! No! keep it this length!" I trusted them, and am liking my hair more and more.|`|ZvWyK94xaa	aww i like it both ways :]<br>  <br>  and if i were you i'd dye it darker and tease it a lot!
Zb4hivNmaa	i love septum piercings<br>  if i had the chance, i'd deffo get it :D<br>  i'm a girl, by the way...haha<br>  <br>  i'd just get a retainer bar.<br>  cause if you ever split up, you'd kinda be gutted that you took it out and let it heal up because of your girlfriend. <br>  however cause you've said you're serious, she won't mind that you have it in. yeah, she thinks you look better without it, but she loves you the way you are :)<br>  <br>  i'm sure theres things that she likes that youre not keen on. but it doesn't mean that she should change them because of you!<br>  <br>  whatever floats your boat :) i say, keep it/retainer!|`|nTzYYsh1aa	If it's a serious relationship, i think you should take it out. If it ends, you can always get it re-done.<br>  But think about it, if you take it out, shell think you did it for her, also she has to look at you everyday so if she doesn't like it, she might get annoyed after a while (not trying to be rude, sorry if it sounds that way)<br>  Plus if it seems to get in the way, think of how much easier it would be when its out.|`|Jjh16FoHaa	A retainer that is well fitted will allow you to switch between a visible piercing and a easily hidden one.<br>  <br>  I had a septum for somthing like 7 years when I decided it was time to get rid of it. <br>  <br>  I had it with a retainer for 4 of those, and it was more comfortable then wearing a full ring, and deffinately better then tusks.|`|KrFQ1gcraa	i find them attractive.<br>  but if it means a lot to you i'd hate to see you take it out for good and then the relationship not last long after.<br>  its really up to you<br>  haha flip it up when you kiss so it's out of the way :)|`|cyi8hhl6aa	It depends how devoted you are to your girlfriend. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would get a retainer until you're sure that you want to give up your piercing for your girlfriend.|`|u93oneUXaa	Take out for good! Unless it's something you really like - don't do it just for her. Do it because you look ridiculous with it on.|`|aWjdYGYdaa	take it out for good please!!!..<br>  i hate septum piercings.. like who the hell wouls want to look like a cow or a bull all the time?? like seriously.. its UNATTRACTIVE<br>  <br>  <br>  mooooooooooooooooo|`|BXgfLFVyaa	if you want to keep it.. you keep it.!|`|y0EkX5BWaa	Keep It.<br>  <br>  Screw The Girl|`|naI5hGjHaa	take it out.  it serves no function in the straight or gay community|`|AA11311675	Get rid of it, but keep the snakebites :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	A...unless you dont want it. i took out my nose ring because there was this guy i liked [before i got married duh lol] and every time we kissed his nose would brush up against mine and pull the stud out...he would always act like it was a neusance so i took it out, a week later we stopped liking eachother. BUT unfortunatly i couldnt get my nose ring back in! it sucked.|`|AA10766729	If she says you look better without it, that's her way of telling you she'd prefer that you didn't' have it, but respects your right to individuality.<br>  <br>  If it were me....and this was a long-term relationship ( you don't see it going downhill anytime soon), I'd consider removing it permanently ....especially with the added caveat that you find it gets in the way of stuff.|`|JduQHocdaa	Flip it up into your nose when needed.|`|3FoU68xuaa	keep it in dude! septum piercings are effing sexy <3|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	keep it<br>  <br>  not to be mean but<br>  she'll get over it if she likes you<br>  and septums are BA :D|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I think you need to ask yourself if you really want it still.  If you do, keep it in.<br>  <br>  If you are indifferent, but think you may want it later, get a retainer.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a reason to finally just put it away, take it out.<br>  <br>  Is this a serious relationship that is going places or just the two of you having fun together for a while?  The more serious you are about the relationship, the more her opinion of the matter should mean to you...|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Well you asked her and she told you - did you not think about what you would do in the event of her answer either way ?  So if you have no intention of removing it then why ask in the first place - Men !!   They are awful - very yesteryear<br>  <br>  You asked she told you - remove it or don't you value her opinion either way?  You say it is serious relationship so start acting like her opinion  is valued then.  She never brooched the subject you did - so no going back.  Different story of she was harping on about it but you had no intention of taking it out.  That's her manipulating you, BUT you were the one to ask for her opinion ................ different set of rules apply now and you opened this can of worms yourself.|`|c6FrTkFRaa	keep it in!<br>  if you like it then dont let anyone else tell you to get rid of something you love...<br>  piercings are the best..<br>  Plus some people will say no and some will say yes<br>  your girlfriend loves u for u or she wouldnt be with you so obviously the piercing aint a problem she just answered your question :]|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	Are you two really serious?<br>  If so, maybe you could take it out for her just to show her how much you love her :)<br>  And if not, just keep it since you like it.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Get a little ring and a leash.  Give her the leash and tell her you've been a naughty boy.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Do what you want, not her. :) <br>  It's gotta be what you prefer.|`|oVp9emiSaa	septum=hott|`|QC6pR4y6aa	ewwww! take it out, gross ick! whatever ur gf wants.

My boyfriend's mother is going to do the beadery and trim work on it to make it "sparkle." Go for a floor length gown, I believe they look more formal for prom, and avoid colors that stray too far from the theme.<br>  <br>  Also, look up cosignment shops in your local phonebook. They offer used, but well taken care of gowns for all occasions at a fraction of a price of what you'd find in department stores like Dillards, Macy's, and JC Penney's.|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Ok, I'm not sure what your into. But, theres a store called Cache. The store itself is not great but they do have some great dresses. There kind of expensive tho. But if you like the dresses it might be worth it.
6SwaWSoyaa	I am a gay guy so I can speak for both I think.<br>  Sweatshirt and sweatpants can be worn occasionally, but not to often or it will make a girl look like she doesn't have confidence.<br>  Guys like confident girls, because when they are trying to get some booty, they want it from someone banging hot....*rolls eyes*<br>  For an actual decent guy who like you they probably would like you to occasionally dress up but they won't care about your clothing.<br>  <br>  overall jeans and tee that correctly fit.|`|rd5468H1aa	I like jeans and t shirts better.|`|MQ5Sq6wfaa	If a girl wears sweat shirts or jeans around me that isn't my girlfriend for several years I'd be severely turned off.  American Eagle makes some okay ones, but they really aren't sweat pants, they are kindof cute.  I can deal with those, but the generic sweat pants and shirts... no way.|`|JrXC1mFXaa	ok im not a guy but... i hang out with nothing but guys.. so here it goes. guys like jeans and a tshirt... but guys love wen girls wear sweat pants i guess it gets there mind on how easy it would be to take them off.|`|iDv0tlAnaa	jeans and tee shirts
zYVCJRMXaa	which ear piercing did you get just typical lobe?<br>  IF typical lobe place piercing in, and start to use rubbing alcohol on it. With lobes rubbing alcohol is the preferred. The claries solution is not good at all and causes infections, use rubbing alcohol for 6 weeks spraying twice a day and rotating the jewelry.<br>  <br>  IF cartilage ear piercing, use sea salt solution and for cartilage 2 months isnt enough to heal they take really 6 months to heal fully and safely.
Drg3bLjUaa	Just sharpen it as you would normally do...I wouldn't recommend using a lighter to make it go on easily :(  just rub the eyeliner between your palms to get some heat through it and that will help the product glide on better xx<br>  <br>  MAC does a pencil sharpener...but to be honest a sharpener is a sharpener!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/products/mp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT11041" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/...</a>|`|RjGGsPInaa	omg your a guy right? ew.|`|bhU37xr9aa	pencil sharpener..then i usually get a lighter and melt the end a little so it glides on easy

WInu4K86aa	the stretch from 8 gauge to 6 gauge is a pretty big difference<br>  if you are fairly new to stretching so it will bleed,<br>  which means your ears aren't ready yet.<br>  you should wait at least 1 - 2 months<br>  between each stretch, even with smaller sizes,<br>  and especially with larger ones. :o)|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Each stretch is like a fresh piercing.  You need to give them 4-6 weeks to heal.  Healing includes not removing the jewelry.  Put the 8g jewelry back in, leave 'em alone for a couple months, and then try again.|`|YZawgdpfaa	you should cover your stretched ears up or get some medical attention

LBHJaqXoaa	Most henna designs are just pretty doodles that mean nothing. Occasionally they will throw in something like a peacock to symbolize luck or a sun to symbolize fertility. Just ask the person giving you the henna tattoo what their design symbolizes and you'll know. <br>  <br>  It depends on what you want tattooed. A small design would only be $12 to $20. Larger areas, like your hands or your feet, could cost up to $300. Well worth it if done by a good artist.|`|b2d0cf5195cadfbca356b914bff173c3aa	DO NOT GET BLACK HENNA!

zYVCJRMXaa	if your navel hurt the industrial probably will heres what to do though, pinch yourself in the area it will help you get an idea and the piercing will probably be less. Keliods are VERY rare though, you may get a thing called the bubble just leave it alone stop moving it around so much and just clean it like normal.<br>  <br>  Best soultion to heal the industrial SEA SALT soaks, no bactine. You could use the soap to clean off crusties but only use it once, really just use the sea salt soaks.<br>  <br>  You may or may not bleed, but probably will some, and the next day but just cane the dry blood off with a q-tip.<br>  The soreness will probably prevent you from wanting to sleep on that side, start not on it. You may end up sleeping on it some but its okay, just start changing your pillow case every three/four days to keep it cleaner and less chance of infection. If you wat to help teh healing take vitamins each day to help but cleaning wise just stick to sea salt solutions. Only clean twice a day/<br>  <br>  The industrial piercing Will be sore for around 1-3 months unlike your navel. Pain not so much but sore yes.<br>  The will insert a bar for healing its better for an industrial for healing so yes you will have the bar.|`|JgIXsKGGaa	I got mine pierced 13 months ago. He used a needle, yes, and it bled just a tiny bit. If you have a cartilage piercing, you will know how it feels. but if you don''t, just feels extremely hot and somewhat stingy, but not painful. the pain kicks in later. esp if you hit it or sleep on it - zmfg that hurts!!!!<br>  anyway, when I got mine pierced, the first incision was not painful. I felt the sensations above, and then the actual painful part came - angling the needle to pierce the proper spot. that part hurt most. but that was only a few seconds and he pierced the second piece; which just so happen to be in an area without cartilage, so it had some blood, but just a smalllllllllllllllll bit. All in all, it was not painful to get, but troublesome to care for. Take a panadol asa you get the piercing, it helps later on. its not too painful but it has a persistent achey sort of feel. (gosh I prollly made it sound soo terribly painful but really! it isnt)<br>  <br>  You cannot sleep on it. Do not be rough with it at least for 3 weeks..i suspect that the more damage to it would mean more scarred tissue.but not necessarily keloids. anyway. use Titanium rods, they are less likely to cause any allergic reactions, tho maybe a tiny bit more expensive. sea salt works well! use it with cotton balls and warm it up for 5 seconds in ur mircowave - seriously, it works! <br>  twirl the rod but try not the push and pull it up and down much at first..and when cleaning, use a gentle liquid soap and always gently pat dry - completely dry.<br>  I got mine infected twice, because the shampoo I was using got it irritated and i also didn't dry it properly. But it was not painful or disgusting, it had swollen a bit, and I used the sea salt and it went away.<br>  Do not use alcohol, no matter what anyone says! Alcohol heals yes, but it also dehydrates! Dehydrating your cells pretty much kills them. <br>  anyway thats about all I can think of..<br>  it takes a while to heal.but if you take care of it properly, it'd be okay =)<br>  good luck! <br>  and don't worry so much, a piercing - and getting pierced - it for you to enjoy, not worry over! =D|`|AXccNMMZaa	if you use two different pieces of jewelry for healing time, there is less of a chance for keloids or hypertrophic scarring.  you can change it to one long bar after it heals if you do that.<br>  <br>  for my ear piercings, i only use h2ocean, it works really well.  you don't really need anything else, but unscented dial soap is good once in a while.  i wouldn't particularly suggest bactine since its pretty strong :)|`|40dUfARwaa	wow<br>  your probably not gonna get a keloid<br>  the pains not that bad, i promise<br>  dont use soap around it only bactine and dont play with it<br>  your ear wont hurt it will probably bleed from all the motion of moving around but nothing serious. and you have to have the bar. thats how they pierce it|`|EAvTly5oaa	While I don't have an industrial, I just got a single helix cartilage piercing.  After reading what people said, I was expecting the pain to be horrible, but I barely felt anything.  For me, the anticipation was worse than the actual piercing.  Hopefully, your piercer will give you a good anti-microbial soap to clean your piercing with.  My piercing had no bleeding either.  As long as you can refrain from sleeping on that side of your face, you should be fine.<br>  Also, although keloids are nasty, they are also very rare.<br>  Just remember to keep your piercing clean and you should be fine.

xDDutHCnaa	It's going to take a while but here are tips to make your hair healthier, shinier, and above all, make it grow faster!<br>  <br>  -Try to use heat on your hair as rarely as possible. I only use it on the weekends. This means curling irons, blow dryers, straighteners, etc. If your hair is like mine and looks funny unless you dry it, then just put it in some braids at night when your hair is wet to make it crimply in the morning or put it in a pony tail.<br>  <br>  -Cut down on hair dying, if you must, use ammonia free hair dye such as Colour Pulse or Herbal Essences Natural Instincts dye. This is much healthier and less damaging to the hair.<br>  <br>  -Only trim your hair when absolutely nessesary. If you follow these tips, then you won't need to trim as often because you will have less split ends. Still try to get about a quarter of an inch snipped off about every 3 months. (Everybody is different but for most people, hair grows a half an inch a month.<br>  <br>  -Before you get in the shower, always gently brush your hair and also massage your scalp for a few minutes. This will draw your natural oils to your roots so it will in turn make your hair shaft healthier. Once this is done and you're in the shower, after shampooing your hair, put some moisturizing conditioner (avoid Pantene, it's full of wax which is unhealthy for your hair), on your hair and massage it in. Leave it in for 2-3 minutes and rinse it out with warm water. After rinsing, blast your hair with some cold water; this will close the cuticle of your hair and make it shinier and less suseptible to damage.<br>  <br>  -Lastly, don't forget to eat right and exercise, it's amazing what vitamins in veggies do for your hair!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy growing :)<br>  <br>  -|`|onvXULozaa	where do you buy it|`|0tKNkAMuaa	ok i hate when this happens. but really there is no way it will grow faster. all you can do is wash it, brush it, and take great care of it...it will grow. don't use harsh chemicals, most likely won't work and will damage your hair.|`|hVZkMkqVaa	this is what i do, and i have the same problem:<br>  <br>  1.

iHna2K7Gaa	Maybe I'm getting old or something (and I'm only 20!), but I definitely don't think you should worry. I remember not liking to shop with my mom because she would always be so awkward and suggest the weirdest things for me, haha. But really, it's not a big deal. So what if she tells people you went shopping with your mom? Is that such a big deal? I guarantee you pretty much every girl your age goes shopping with him mom once in a while. No big deal! And if she does try to make it sound it's weird that you were at the mall with your mom, just blow her off and act like your mom was taking you out on a shopping spree or something. That's what I used to tell people. "Yeah, I went shopping with my mom yesterday, but I actually like it because she pays for EVERYTHING"...even if she actually didn't lol.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and don't fret. Just enjoy spending the time with your mother. I know it sounds cliche, but once you move out for college or for work or whatever, you'll really miss her and you'll regret not enjoying these moments more. Don't worry about what other people think. :)|`|p8rxpA98aa	It's not such a big deal. If they think ur weird or dorky for going out with ur mom, they're ***holes. I go out with my mom ALL the time, there's nothing wrong with it. Think about how ur mom would feel if she knew u were so embarrassed by her. Just say ur hanging out with ur mom, so what?

qPd5G3dSaa	ok what you need is:<br>  wet hair<br>  hair dryer with a diffuser<br>  straightener (duh lol :D)<br>  some sort of curling gel<br>  mouse<br>  straigtener hair protection spray<br>  pony tale holders<br>  hairspray<br>  <br>  1st- on clean wet hair add mouse and curling gel<br>  <br>  2nd- turn your hair upside down and blow dry while scrunching <br>  <br>  3rd- add hair protection (they also make that stuff for curling) <br>  <br>  4th- part your hair into sections (i start at the nape of the neck) and put the rest into a pony and start curling<br>  <br>  * to curl take small sections of your hair at a time and put the straightener as close to your roots as possible, close the straightener and twist it until all the hair is twisted, then just pull straight... and wah lah bouncy curls, right after you curl add hair spray so it wont uncurl|`|mkSxfmzqaa	Alright, so the first thing you do is let your straightener heat up. Then take a small strand of hair and comb it quickly then take your straightener and put it about an inch-inch and a half away from your head, then clamp down. Now turn the straightener one full turn going inwards. If you go outwards the curl will turn out funny. Then go down VERY slowly. Do not unclamp your starightener because your hair will come out itself. Now repeat on your entire head. Remember to go down slowly and do small strands of hair because if they are too big your curls won't turn out very good. Once you have done your whole head put in some hairspray so the curls stay in and have fun with it. You could put it half up half down, put in some cute clips and more, or just leave it curly. Good luck! Hope I helped! :)|`|yQF4yldxaa	as you get closer to the ends of your hair turn the straightener in the direction you want to curl you hair in use it the same way as you use a curler but don't wrap the hair around completely turn and pull turn and pull|`|n4OW84CWaa	Read this and scroll down to watch a video:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Hair-with-Straighteners" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Hair-with-St...</a>|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	use it just like a culling iron. but it kinda comes out like shi-t . your better off useing a curling iron!|`|Ea3otu55aa	well u take it when it is hot and start to straighten it and then  curly it in the direction u want it 2 face

But if your really set on getting coach ask them for a little wristlet...they are lightweight...pretty good price...holds pretty much what you would need.[gum.cash.and if you have a cell...a cell]. And if they still won't go for that save up with allowance or ask for it for you birthday.

YOU'RE ELEVEN.|`|c75136fa3cfb0f896f32ff0cd1d36ffcaa	aldo, i get my purses there and theyre 25-40 bucks|`|hxdV0wa4aa	When I was 11 I always wanted coach purses too, and I got a few. Trust me, it's not worth it- you probably won't like them in two years, and they are usually far too expensive. That wouldn't have changed my mind when I was your age though, so try chinatown or a nearby outlet mall- they have fantastic sales, just look it up.
TO9WPD6Haa	well your hair grows about half an inch a month so i guess 5-9 months depending on how well you care for your hair. you really have to use less products, way less heat products so you dont get that many split ends which will make your hair length longer, cause you dont have to keep cutting often. if you dont do much damage to your hair then it will probably be grown to that length by at least a year. <br>  hope that helped you out|`|aDxaEvx8aa	brushing your hair often will definitely speed up the growth.<br>  also, make sure your hair isn't too greasy.

Y4ATEWCdaa	I have this problem too. The best (and only) way it works for me is after I shower, I towel dry my hair as best as I can, then I braid my hair into about 10 sections; five on the upper half of my head and five on the lower. Go to bed looking silly then undo them and brush them out in the morning. Hope this works for you.|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	You can curl your hair with a straightener by just rotating it around a section of hair.<br>  If you're hair's a little wavy, Garnier makes a bunch of curl stuff that I find works really well.|`|UAq9ogIQaa	a crimper|`|qgGRIuRdaa	well i always straighten my hair but when i get out of the shower when my hair is still wet i  out this stuff called h2o un-frizzed and dont blow dry my hair and then when your hair is dry it is cute and wavy|`|5TMzUFmsaa	i use sunsilk waves of envy spray. i take a shower, let my hair stay in the towel for 10 min then spray my head (i have very thick hair), then i scrunch it. then i sleep wake up and put in a clip it|`|tIPiGkKtaa	I don't know any but the amika curling iron is the absolute curling iron ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|mLXhUwUmaa	garnier frutise natural waves i dont know how its spelled|`|TMS8nHM6aa	If you could wait for overnight, you could get your hair wet, ( you don't have to if you can't)... braid your hair in however many braids you want (the more braids, the wavier your hair is going to be) sleep on it overnight and then in the morning let your hair down and it will look wavy.  (You may need to use hairspray in the morning)|`|I2WtPZHraa	if you dont really have naturally curly/ wavy hair you cant really put a curl/wave enchancing product if theres no curl to enhance. Your best bet is curler/crimper and maybe use some product like sunsilk captivating curl & cream twist after washing your hair let it air dry and then curl/crimp it. good luck! :)|`|JKERXFuiaa	plait your hair all over when its wet, and then sleep on it.<br>  then if its still damp in the morning (it shouldnt be) then roughly towel dry it, and then tame the waves with a tiny bit of serum if needed.<br>  finish with hairspray to hold the waves in place:)|`|guxELB16aa	Mesh Spring Curlers! I put them in my hair overnight and wake up with soft waves and loads of body. I also love Shikai Color Reflect Shine Serum--it especially makes waves silky, and doesn't make it stiff or crunchy.|`|H1IG59aqaa	I would use a crimper or they even have rollers that will do this also or even scrunch it when its wet and put some gel in it.|`|kUmRJNvnaa	Try and a voluming shampoo & conditioner. Also, braid your hair, or put it in a bun when your hair is damp.|`|vbiYLgCHaa	there is this stuff i saw on shelf's in store and its like a gel for making your hair straight oh yeah moose|`|37DTSXZJaa	all you have to do is french braid your hair in two parts and add a curl defining mouse and/or gel and coat the braids with it..when u are sure that the braids are dry take them out and fix it how you want and add a bit of hair spray:) good luck dear|`|D0xeJoW1aa	You can you a striaghtner to curl the tips then afterward move it back and forth. Or you can you the crimper curlers.|`|iNBM3nI3aa	if you want it wavy then use a crimper but put in mouse when your hair is damp and blow dry with a diffuser|`|7Yz7xc37aa	what i like to use is a crimper!
guxELB16aa	Definitly Pantene Pro-V Classic In Control Mousse! I swear by it because it makes my curly/waves tighter looking. I apply it right after I wash my hair and It makes my waves shape better and the curls appear bouncy! : )|`|bWh1SjyMaa	If your looking to make your hair more curly there are some shampoos that will do just that so I would ask a salon stylist for something like that ok?  P.S. And you don't have to use very much of it either...

It's a real designer bag. Coach isn't in my opinion. It's more classy and unique. The Coach bags with the logo all over are very juvenile in my opinion. The leather ones are ok but kind of plain.

zYVCJRMXaa	stick it in very warm water your ear and then take it out and get a q-tip to get the dried blood now loosened and cruties, stick back under the warm water and move it around the warm water should help, you should force it slightly yes after two days, the first day is fine to leave it alone but now you should push it some. Make sure hands are clean!<br>  Be gradual though.|`|3ZnjKIuAaa	omg that is so awsome you got it done!!!!!  you do need to twist it everyday, it is very important.  since it seems hard to do it right now try soaking your ear in hot water,that should loosing things up.  good luck!|`|AXccNMMZaa	no, its not a problem.<br>  just make sure its clean, and do not twist or move it.<br>  that just opens up the places that are trying to heal themeslves.|`|s8URbvwraa	Twist it. The person who pierced your ear should have told you to twist it everyday so you dont get crustys.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Yes it is. Your blood has probably crusted along the thing making it hard and painful to move.<br>  DON'T listen to the person with pink hair! you do need to twist it. If you can't that can lead to further problems and infection. It can also make your skin attach itself to the earring, just like what I said above. If it is crusty that is probably what has happened.

mhyL7Qw3aa	Try BigLots if you have one near you. They always have foundation brushes whenever I go over there. Plus they are really cheap.|`|NAwzuLayaa	You can get one in almost any drug store, or places such as Sephora or Mac Cosmetics. Here are the average prices (in California): <br>  <br>  Drug Store: $6<br>  Sephora: $25<br>  Mac Cosmetics: $32<br>  <br>  Out of all, I love the ecotools foundation brush, it's soft and drys almost instantly after being washed. You can purchase it at walgreens. I'll put the link in sources. Good luck!|`|XfWoNzXWaa	none of the cheap ones really work for me, but if you want one like the mac 191, you can get it at art stores, but if you want a really good one, go to a department store, sephora, or a mac store, cuz thts were there da best.|`|Tdivh1Vbaa	ulta or any drug storee =D<br>  -sarahbaybee?|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	Ulta or Sephora|`|i8RWcBcbaa	I would recommend going to your local Ulta.

Shes young and should be going by natural beauty, not make-up. Maybe a little cover-up to go over zits and maybe some eye shadow and lip gloss for nights out but no more than that. Stay young.|`|0CSl9loRaa	oh my gosh, i have the same problem with my friend. she's 14 but she's a cakeface. she wears 3 foundations. yes, that's way too much. she's TWELVE. really, she should just be wearing a little bit of makeup, if none at all. you might want to tell her upfront before even more people start talking.|`|S6nsbqPiaa	no way! im only 2 years older than her. <br>  and compared to the makeup i am wearing, she wears a little bit.|`|QbpK9GbTaa	Uhm yeah it does but who really cares?<br>  its her face and when she thinks shes wearing to much she will reduce it herself.|`|u9V7eNGnaa	Twelve year olds shouldn't wear make up, period.|`|mVEGrVuWaa	Yeah it sounds like it.<br>  She should lighten up and go for a natural look.|`|dndFiZrIaa	why are you so worried about it? if you're that offended by it, tell her to take it off.|`|722b542b7a67ede38cb14f02c50a186eaa	PIC?|`|OnTXgFx1aa	ya?|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	kinda i mean it may add <br>  confidence though no one <br>  knows her and why she does <br>  wear that much|`|LcEY08kAaa	UHmmmm, YES!|`|XkWTsyJdaa	ewwwwww IN her eye!? thats disgusting. i think all that liner with the bronzer is just plain trashy. when i was 12 i started wearing liner, just on my waterline (bottom lid) and lipgloss and concealer here and there. that is definately too much, not just cuz shes 12, its too much for anyone|`|4uKbpwVtaa	yesssss it sounds wayyyyy to much. especially for a 12 year old. does she want to get laid?! seriously it's just school and makeup will make you old and wrinkly earlier. she probably looks like a fake. i hate people who wear too much makeup. a little bit makes you look good but too much just looks trashy|`|WkqagpZmaa	sounds like it.|`|Y0O6971laa	waaaaay too much.  tell her katie says to scrape the gunk off of her face :)|`|HUsv9VU9aa	She is too young to be wearing that much make up. And that giant dot of eye IN by the pupil is the liquid eyeliner that is going inside. She's either applying it wrong and/or wearing too much of it that she's not even wearing it for the day. It can also be from not removing the make up from the day before.|`|BduhncGTaa	yeah, it seems like it! if she really likes makeup that much, you should tell her to just tone it down a bit. intead of liquid, tell her she should use a brown kohl eyeliner. and unless she has blemishes everywhere, she doesnt need all that face makeup. but if she REALLY needs it/wants it, tell her to at least get it in her shade.|`|ov5F2Fmnaa	i believe she is wearing too much make up and shes too young to be wearing that much. but hey its her body right? but anyways if she keeps that up shes going to gwt wrinkles pretty fast because theres little holes that you cant see in everyones faces and if you cover them up then shes going to get wrinkles pretty quickly. she really should try to cut the habit out.|`|Drg3bLjUaa	my daughter is 12 and to be honest there is NO WAY I would let her wear that much make up...younger girl's skins are beautiful with a natural glow that many adults try to achieve...the most my daughter is allowed to wear on special occasions is a one coat of mascara and a clear lip gloss...|`|6npsRIzUaa	It does sound like a lot. Maybe she needs some tips on how to put on and wear makeup, I know some M.A.C. cosmetics stores will do your makeup and suggest products for you, maybe you could find a place near you that you could take your friend to? That might help her out and point her in the right direction.|`|g5vnwHTdaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwww SHES 12? im almost 15 and i just wear a thin line of top liner concealer and mascara. be honest with her tell her it makes her look like a whhhooorrrre. cause thats sick|`|KBN0kfKsaa	Wow not only does she wear a lot of make up she's super young to be wearing it too|`|9ib0tC9Waa	I'd say any makeup is almost too much for a 12 year old.
KKxX5wszaa	If you want to get yellow shoes, I think you should go with Vans. Vans have a majority of styles and colors. As, well as Chucks. Vans are preferably for skaters, and Chucks are more for casual dress. It doesn't really matter what we think though. Anything can look better if you can make it work. So buy what you want. I personally like both styles. They are nothing wrong with them, plus you are going to be spending like forty bucks on them. They better look nice and make you look good right. Fashion, styles, and trends are what you make it. I hope that I helped.

rIzx4OEWaa	Hi Jenni, What a tremendous thing you have done for others an what a greatexample you have given to others for raising money. I had earlier suggested only half of what I had been trying to say which made it all seem a little daft. I have just started some new pain killers an made the mistake of taken them at the same time as my sleeping pill after that I have no real idea what i did an can be thankful there was no after effects except on here (lol) A wig is the obvious choice to suggest or a nice hat but what about a nice tatoo of something like a butterfly or a workof art saying it was done for charity It would help add to the money you have already raised. as your hair will grow back it will hide it later but in the mean time it will look different an could be very unusual. an whe your hair starts to grow back you could have some hair extension put on to give it more body they are worth every cent. give it a try. I hope you like the idea.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Just get a wig that looks good and not fake|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	I'd just go buy a wig to be honest.<br>  Hit up Ebay, the have a great variety.|`|OJn8QwEZaa	First off let me say, congrats and good for you that you help out those in need! <br>  <br>  Yes, I know style can be difficult at times however, I suggest you wear more jewelry. Studs are highly in style so are hoops, chandelier, and bamboo earrings. Try necklaces and dark wash skinny jeans are always cool. Graphic Ts are pretty and try wearing more tighter shirts, and feminine colored things. Add shine to your face with lip gloss.|`|GWfl2elyaa	Yeah, that's kinda hard because for women, hair is their crowning glory but in terms of clothing, my advice will be one sided tops/shoulder revealing tops and skinny jeans.|`|2gKA7uDkaa	same thing <br>  <br>  with a wig<br>  <br>  don't change ur style<br>  <br>  <br>  (or if you have a sister, shave her head, and if you don't have a sister, find a family member or any friends so you don't feel out of place lol)|`|bcYRWlAHaa	thats a really good thing you did for charity :)<br>  try cute scarves on your head or one of those cute cabbie type hats.<br>  and for your clothes, experiment with color, try pink and purple and wear scarves and carry cute purses. or try light sparkly eyeshadows and pale lip glosses too.<br>  if you want to avoid looking like a boy, dont wear lose clothing and dont wear anything extremely simple... add a little jazz to your wardrobe and you should be good :)|`|wTy2p2wPaa	Aw that's a great thing you did for charity :) & just wear vets and shorts, be a bit like Jade Goody, she's got a bald head and she doesn't let anyone bring her down - good on her.( poor woman I hope she survives. )|`|7febd1924ed15c4568a394f303b9f586aa	maybe you can get a wig that is like your old hair? <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuGqMMFOevz7nzw62xmXzM7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222173614AAhLKFP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|v1kpmmGwaa	a hat of some sort if you do have massive boobs the men wont notice your bald head|`|mnAFVaK5aa	Why dont you buy a wig?|`|722b542b7a67ede38cb14f02c50a186eaa	color! it|`|LwWkzbLmaa	Wear a wig|`|6SdurpODaa	firstly, it is great what you did, that means SO much.<br>  secondly, for makeup, i'd suggest emphasis on the eyes.. bright-ish colours, but not outstanding.. maybe calm blues/greens, or yellowy/browny shades. for clothing style.. im visioning the loose but moderatly dressy, and skinny jeans.<br>  <br>  examples are :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.garage.ca/productDetail.aspx?productId=11146&displayGroupId=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.garage.ca/productDetail.aspx?...</a> ( shirt )<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.garage.ca/productDetail.aspx?productId=10516&displayGroupId=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.garage.ca/productDetail.aspx?...</a> ( jeans )  <br>  <br>  for the jeans, i'd recommend a looser look, not like super baggy, but not skin tight..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blnts.com/eng/productdetails/redirect.cfm?sectionID=b2c/style/productDetails.cfm&itemID=50433364106&&var=d&itemCategoryLevel1=180&itemCategoryLevel2=208&ckey=CA&place_holderID=34&number_results=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.blnts.com/eng/productdetails/...</a>  ( tank )<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|i7WVSXnWaa	i think bald girls are still fashionable....<br>  <br>  but i think you can wear the clothes that <br>  <br>  you wear before you get bald.|`|AA10843517	i dont want to hurt you but you should buy wigs in order for you to find a good/best dress.

OXLJPgUlaa	when you go to the hair salon, there will be hair style books for both men and women, but incase they don't have the hairstyle you want like the ones you've numbered, take a picture, maybe a couple so the stylist gets a view from all sides.<br>  and no, they don't cut your hair like that. they somewhat layer your hair and trimm so your hair gets thinner and many layers, then you will have to style it like that every morning. <br>  you can ask them tips to styling and using hair wax to spike it up.<br>  the stylist will cut your hair so, basically all you have to do in the morning is brush and lightly wax.<br>  they'll cut it somewhat like this, then you need to wax it up<br>  :<a href="http://waterpixie.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/jaejoong-blowfish.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://waterpixie.files.wordpress.com/20...</a>|`|dookiJfuaa	Why do you want your haircut like that!

0tKNkAMuaa	ok well i get that you want to wear makeup but its not necessary. but since you do i will help you.... any kind of black eyeliner will look good, but don't put it on to much, make it lighter. you can get that at rite aid, longs, wallgreens, target, etc. a lipgloss is really nice because its easy to put on and doesn't feel weird. with brown eyes a pink glossy lip gloss would look great. you could put on red blush except lightly. eyeshadow is a kinda, i think simple is better but eyeshadow, maybe a light pink...  thought a neutral color would look awesome. blush and lip gloss is simple to put on. eyeshadow and eyeliner are harder but you could ask a parent, or friend to help you. good luck! hope i helped!|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	You can wear purple eyeshadow, this will really bring out your brown eyes and it will match your dress. Revlon has a quad named Berry Bloom and there is a light purple there that you can use on your lid. All you do is take the sponge applicator of a medium eyeshadow brush if you have one and tap your applicator (or brush) in the eyeshadow and dust off some of the excess. Then tap lightly on your eyelid but don't go past the crease. Then take the dark purple and tip the end of your applicator and apply it on your crease with windshield wiper motions. Line your eyes with a black eyeliner (I prefer Jordana because they are creamy) by placing the eyeliner at the base of your lahes and rub in between your lashes back and forth also line your lower lash line. Apply a volumizing mascara, I really like Cover Girl's Lash Blast because it really brings out my eyes. For your lips pick a pink or peach lipstick. <br>  The Revlon Quad is only $6, The Jordana Kohl liner is only $2, and Cover Girl Lash Blast is $7.|`|kwjNYjEsaa	ok wear a tiny bit of mascara, to apply brush upwards on upper lashes to increase volume, and downwards on the lower lashes. i would suggest covergirl mascars. put NOTHING on your skin except for a maroon blush, apply it very litely with a large brush and keep it on the apple of your cheeks and blend into your skin with your hands ( the apple of your cheeks are about and inch down form the center of your eyes and an inch to the right, on the right side of the face and the same on the left except an inch to the left). i suggest N.Y.C. blush. if you want eyeliner wear a BROWN color and only apply it to the top lid (have your mom help you) wearing it on the bottom just makes your eyes shrink. ( i suggest N.Y.C. eyeliner) and after that you're done! make sure your mom approves first|`|ILNNfCJSaa	I think since your 14 like me :) just wear it simple and not to much.<br>  For ex. Almay  is a good brand to buy, very affordable and<br>  is not tested on animals. (You can get it at a local drugstore-walgreens, target, etc.<br>  You could wear mascara, eyeliner, little bit of eyeshadow and some lip gloss. : )|`|U1BHQYngaa	mmkay, so you have a purple dress... i'd say, go to walmart to chose all your make-up, they have very cheap prices, for very good make-up. you see, i'll admit, i wear a lot of make-up. but i do not look bad at all.... this is my say....:<br>  <br>  okay, for brown eyes,<br>  <br>  EYELINER:<br>  choose a PURPLE AMYTHIST eyeliner, do not cake it on....<br>  pull the bottom of your eye down and highlight the spot above the bottom lashes. do not use too much, for you will look like a racoon...<br>  EYESHADOW:<br>  you could use a smokey grey, or brown as an everyday wear.... but since we are going for a totally hawt, and spunky look for a purple dress, we will be using a SET OF 3 or 4 DIFFERENT SHADES of PURPLE.<br>  first take the light colour of purple, and start out on the lower part of your lid, almost hitting your top lashes... higlight that so it is visible, (you can also wet th eyeshadow brush with a little water for a darker look), then take the darkest colour purple and highlight the higher part of your crease. next take the lighest colour of purple and highlight the the browbone, look at this picture(<a href="http://www.stylelist.com/blog/2008/11/27/how-to-wear-purple-eyeshadow-tip-of-the-day/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.stylelist.com/blog/2008/11/27...</a><br>  MASCARA:<br>  Use BIG SEXY LASHES, its amazing, i use it myself. just keep your eyes open when doing mascara,get as far as you can to your eye without poking it, and just highlight up, and do that untill all the lashes are big and beautiful.<br>  COVER UP (CONCEALER)<br>  now, the hardest part, if you have pimples you may need this, if not, keep it natural and skip this last section.... when in walmart, have a parent or friend with you and look at different colours of the cover up... get as close to your skin colour as possible. you DO NOT want to look orange, bad thing right there, lol. okay so when you put it on, use your fingers and blend it evenly all around your face. make sure you've got all the spots.<br>  LOOSE POWDER<br>  buy your skin tone of loose powder so you do not have the oily look, and it makes it look beautiful and natural...<br>  BLUSH<br>  pick out a colour that would look well on you, and stroke the brush in the powder, blow on it a little so it wont put too much colour on your face.<br>  <br>  viola, there ya go, i hope i helped.

LBHJaqXoaa	What I would do if I were you: I would gather pictures of real cherry blossoms. I would find a good tattoo artist. Then I would give him or her the pictures of the cherry blossoms and tell him or her that you only want it to go from the armpit to just under the bustline. <br>  <br>  The artist would then draw up something that would fit the area in which you would like tattooed. It would be 100% original and unique. And tattoo artists love challenges like this.

rGci1ehoaa	1<br>  Eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals to keep your hair healthy and boost growth. The condition of your hair will reflect the condition of your body, so if you are healthy and well nourished it shows in beautiful, shiny hair. Supplement your diet with lots of raw fruits and vegetables, particularly green and yellow vegetables rich in beta-carotene, vitamin A and B Vitamins, active agents essential to hair growth.<br>  Step2<br>  Add healthy proteins to your diet, as hair literally is protein. Great food sources for protein include brewer's yeast, fish, beans, yogurt, soy and eggs. Protein will not only strengthen your hair, but improves hair growth.<br>  Step3<br>  Reduce factors that may inhibit hair growth. Constant stress can impede hair growth, so practicing meditation and relaxation techniques as well as getting plenty of sleep can aid your body in stimulating hair growth. Some medications are known to stop or slow the hair from growing, so speak to your doctors about the side effects of your medication and alternative options. Other factors, such as caffeine, sugar and excess fat in your diet can weaken your body and effect hair growth.<br>  Step4<br>  Massage your scalp gently for a few minutes every day to stimulate blood flow to the hair follicles, improving hair growth. You can purchase electric massagers made for the face and scalp that can be relaxing and helpful for hair growth.<br>  Step5<br>  Add essential oils of ylang ylang and lavender to your shampoo, conditioner and hair care products. As a general rule, add 1 drop of each oil to every 2 oz. of product. These oils not only have a beautiful aroma, but gently stimulate the hair follicles, aiding in hair growth.<br>  Step6<br>  Moisturize your scalp with a few teaspoons of jojoba oil, particularly if you are predisposed to conditions such as psoriasis, seborrhea, eczema and dandruff. Native American Indians of the Southwestern United States have used jojoba oil for centuries as a natural method to promote hair growth. Jojoba oil is hypoallergenic and is the perfect hair moisturizer, as it resembles the hairs own natural oil.<br>  Step7<br>  Make your own natural shampoo from aloe vera, which can help clear blockages in the pores of the scalp and balance the pH level of your hair, two factors which improve hair growth. Another common recipe of the Native American Indians, mix equal amounts of wheat germ oil, aloe vera and coconut milk and use the mixture just like any other shampoo.<br>  <br>  I KNOW YOU SAID WITHOUT PRODUCTS BUT I FIGURED I WOULD SHARE ALL THE TIPS I FOUND.. HOPE THIS HELPS!! I KNOW VITAMINS AND EATING HEALTHY DEF WORKS FOR ME.. HOPE THIS HELPS!!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massaging makes a lot of difference to the rate at which hair grows, so a regular massage  with any oil of your choice is recommended to speed up the process.

You can get loads of money after you take a course and send out flyers. Don't watch TV or go on the comp. while you babysit, play w/ the kids, and bring prizes for them! <br>  <br>  My sis saved $700 after babysitting for 1 year! <br>  <br>  You aren't gonna get $500 in less than a year. I would ask my friends for gift cards to the places where they sell all the items you need. Try going to a cheaper place like Hollister, Urban Outfitters, Anthropology, Forever 21. Wait till the items are on sale, too! <br>  <br>  Do chores around the house, and ask your parents. Maybe, when they see how resposible you are, they will buy the stuff for you. Most likely, you will not be able to get the money in less than a year. You probably don't really need that stuff.

And if you really NEED 600$ per month, then you still dont want to waist any other money on that other stuff, then you dont deserve that other stuff.  oh and if you dont do chores, than maybe its time to try some.  welcome to real life hunny.

cI4TFsnjaa	Well, I know how that one goes! I have the same problem. When I go tanning my body tans real fast but my face just never seems to tan. To answer your question, I've tried both the beds and the stand up, and both will work the same, regardless which you go in your face is just going to need more visits in order to get the tan you want. Going more than twice will be helpful, you would be wasting your money if you go once or twice and then dont go for like 2 weeks cause you're just going to lose the tan and you're back at stage one. If you want to keep the tan, I would go regularly to see results, but not over expose yourself in one week. Take a few visits a week and before you know it you will be tan, and your face will be as well.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Well, I work with a girl who also works in a tanning salon or w/e and she says you have to build up your tan in order for it to look good an natural cuz some girl she knows went and wanted to do it in one shot => she ended up orange. So there you go. If you want better results you need to pay more. <br>  You can try asking what they recommend for your skin complexion, or if they'll let you tan before you pay so you can see if you want the package or just the single tan.<br>  I don't really know for sure, but in the tanning bed the UV rays emitted where you place your head could be lower than the rest of your body since your face is more sensitive and probably burns easily.<br>  <br>  Going a couple times is ok, but you don't want to make it a habit. Some people get addicted to tanning and that results in skin cancer (melanoma).|`|0jQkajfOaa	i dont no u have to like build up to it really..<br>  i just went for 2nd time this year..<br>  yea failure to me. im bright red on my face,tooshy, everywhere. <br>  it sucks. and hurts. just saying =P

6SwaWSoyaa	that would be more of an african-american trait; however, it isn't that common. brown eyes are the most common color in the world, but usually the rims are either gray, black, or brown. Mine are brown with greenish-black rim, but I am biracial.|`|0344c2c0292060f2232027aa97515130aa	I don't know but my eyes are green with a blue-gray ring. I'm caucasian.

KmwrfHPtaa	Oh no!<br>  <br>  Don't try to blow dry a fro.. bad idea. But gel or mousse (mousse being ideal) distributed evenly throughout your hair is good. I have curly semi-loose spirals and when my hair is wet I add a cream and shine serum, then brush through, then a small handful of mousse (i have long hair) and I run that through, making sure to get the undersides too. Then brush through, then finger comb your hair to kind of separate the strands. At this point just kind of push your hair up to your scalp from the very ends. <br>  <br>  It's a lot more simple than it seems.|`|mS0ulYUoaa	u need mouse ur hands wet hair kay apply mouse to ur hair then like play with ur hair and scrunch it with ur hands|`|8mBDFm4Xaa	put either mousse or gel in you hair while it is wet. then blow dry your hair with a diffuser on the hair dryer.|`|jhFT5kT1aa	don't brush your hair when it is dry<br>  Right after you get out of the shower comb it and put in mouse or gel and run it through your hair and kinda scrunch.<br>  <br>  Here it is into more detail:)<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Scrunch-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Scrunch-Hair</a>|`|onvXULozaa	like she said

0atD75b8aa	Well for dandruff you could use a shampoo and conditioner called "Selsen Blue" you can find it anywhere at your drugstores.<br>  And as for making you hair shiny, and healthy to grow faster here is a great article on how to get it!<br>  Enjoy!<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Hair-Grow-Faster" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Hair-Gr...</a>|`|jwE6sCFzaa	Well you can use that Head and Shoulders shampoo|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	You cannot get it to grow faster but you can get rid of the dandruff. Try a shampoo with tea tree oil. Or the ones for psoriasis like T-Gel or Nizoral. If this doesn't give you the healthy shine you want try a product like bio-silk oil. Put a little in your hand, rub your hands together then wipe your hands down your hair. Start about halfway down on the first pass so the roots don't look oily. I like to take my hair between my palms and rub the oil in that way then run it from the roots. Good luck.|`|5KzOOjHuaa	Get dandruff shampoo(dosent have to be head and shoulders)<br>  Then if you use olive oil shampoo and conditioner it makes your hair smoother silkier and it makes your hair grow, this may be what you're looking for.<br>    You can get some cheap at Sally's Beauty Supply.|`|6jtYOd8Faa	Use Head and Shoulders..

LBHJaqXoaa	I think the charm bracelet would be a great idea. It also opens up more opportunities to put more charms on there if you have more children or other important milestones. I think your request would be a reasonable one. And they can make it fit either your wrist or your ankle, which ever you prefer. <br>  <br>  Nobody can give you an accurate quote unless they are a tattoo artist from your area. Prices vary so much from shop to shop. My guess, in my area, it would cost you about $200.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	yeah go ahead, it's your self expression|`|DpStw8RBaa	I really like the idea of an ankle bracelet tattoo that you can add charms to as needed. I think that as long as the charms are not too detailed they would be able to fit on your ankle.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I personally think it is adorable! Maybe it could fit on you're ankle probably not you're wrist!

2sLfhnPpaa	lol, I've had my nostrils pierced twice and it absolutely does hurt. How could it not, they are shoving a needle through your flesh.  It is over in just a few moments though and I've had mine for years now and still love it. It is like puling out a nose hair times 20. It makes your nose run and your eyes water and I laughed a bit from the pain (an odd natural reaction).<br>  <br>  You don't have to worry about being allergic as long as you make sure you get surgical steel, NOT gold or titanium or all that stuff, pure surgical steel.  I am allergic to nickel which is in a lot of cheaper jewelry and have never had a problem with any of my surgical steel piercings (nose, ears, nipples). Besides, the silver color is far better than gold for a young person!<br>  <br>  Do it!! Good luck girl! You will be FINE!|`|llgBLR6daa	i'm not sure about the nose but ear piercing didn't hurt at all for me. (i have a high tolerance for pain however-its different for everyone) if you're still really young(or still go to a pediatrician) sometimes they can do it-mine did it for me. make sure you be careful where you go because the more hygienic the place and tools, the less of a chance there will be of getting it infected. some earrings on the packages say "hypo-allergenic" which you should stick to if you're nervous about an allergic reaction. also clean it with rubbing alcohol wipes daily if you get it done. good luck!|`|CX27uSAgaa	k. nose.. it doesnt hurt. but ur eyes will water just because that happens when ur have pain with ur nose... it MIGHT sting a bit. and ears... couldnt even feel it. .. and if you think u might be allergic to something.. just go with gold rings. u can never go wrong with gold.|`|5CH0nQQraa	Getting your nose pierced does hurt. Not unbearable, excruciating pain, but pain none the less.<br>  <br>  I think it's more the anticipation that gets you. I did it myself, so it took longer and the pain was dragged out a bit, but I'd recommend not doing it yourself because you can end up with and infection. When you get it done at a parlor, it's two seconds and your done.<br>  <br>  Your eyes will water, but that's about it. And it will be sore.<br>  <br>  As for ears, I've heard it feels like a quick pinch. Accompanied, of course, by soreness.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to clean either piercing regularly to avoid infection.|`|pdN0UHrsaa	you should let it be done to a doctor. I tried that many times. the first time i tried it, my ears were swollen and became reddish-violet. <br>  <br>  though it's kinda painful, if you really are willing to have your ear or your nose pierced up, then, you can tell your doctor to put anesthesia first. So that you can't feel the pain. <br>  <br>  after you get your nose/ear pierced, take amoxixilyn (anti-bacteria & anti-allergies) so that, it won't get swollen after piercing.
7wA2zYHPaa	I wouldn't spend money unless you know for sure you like them and that they fit you the way you like. no one can really tell you if something is going to fit you.<br>  <br>  But, the second pair do appear tighter fitting than the first, so chances are they will end up similarly fitting on your legs.

b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but make sure to rinse it all out very thoroughly to get all the residue out.  Give your hair a final cold rinse to flatten the cuticle.<br>  <br>  Then, apply a leave-in conditioner.  I like Infusium.  Apply a straightening creme if you need it.  Blow dry with a boar's hair brush... they use boar's hair brushes on hair product commercials to make hair shinier.<br>  <br>  Once it's blow dried, you might want to flat iron it to give it a little extra polish.  It's a good idea to get a high-quality ceramic or tourmaline iron, and work quickly so that you don't burn your hair.  Then, use a tiny bit of shine serum... a really tiny bit, so that your hair doesn't look greasy.<br>  <br>  Frizz-Ease has some great products... I use their stuff lots.|`|qlepHpX0aa	There is a serum called Biosilk that you can use you put it in your hair before blow drying and flat ironing.

Society is weird.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Yeah, your only options are makeup or basically sanding it off.  There's no quick way to do it.<br>  <br>  This is why I always tell people to think twice about getting tattoos on their wrists.  It's hard to cover up and now you know what happens when you can't cover it.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You could always just use makeup on it, or try the product called wrecking balm.

OR you could ask if you could wear a wristband, just a normal color that matches your outfit over it. It will be tight enough where it won't slip and its not unsightly. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Rr4IVYbvaa	You could always be cheeky and wear a wrist guard and claim you "hurt your wrist"|`|br1FB5rraa	I would say to use wrecking balm.

mfJ7LDgxaa	I read that putting it on before bed helps it absorb better through out the night because your pores open up. <br>  <br>  As far as clogging your pores go, that's not something you have to worry about. <br>  <br>  It's also good to put deodorant on right after you get out of the shower while your pores are still open.|`|iyRczu0eaa	well ur gonna be less stinky due to twice the application haha|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	No. You will just clog up your pores under your arms.|`|z2EHX8pTaa	i do that, and it smells rely good.<br>  haha, idk y, but i did that alot and the deo scent just absorbed? in my body. these days, i dont put deo on and my body naturally smells like it now. i think its cuz i put it on at nite a long time ago.
kCdISEGqaa	Yeah, it's not really something we ask about.  Some artists are curious, and like to ask what the meaning behind the tattoo is, but, really, it's none of our business why you're getting tattooed.  Military tattoos can be worn as a sign of patriotism, as a memorial, or as a way to show pride for serving.  Don't worry about it, if it's what you want, do it!  Best wishes!!!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Depends on the artist, but expect some repercussions if you get a military tattoo and a military person finds out about it, some of them really don't like that kind of disrespect.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	They are getting paid for it so they shouldn't care what it is or why.<br>  <br>  However, you may want a good reason to have it so when someone else asks why you have it you don't look like an idiot (IE you want to go into that branch, a friend/relative is in the military, etc).<br>  <br>  Also, if you are looking to go voluntarily into the military, some branches won't allow you to have a tattoo, so keep that in mind.|`|fo3LuTgDaa	its really none of their business if your military or not. if you want a tattoo and your payn they gotta give it 2 you.
1Thb8v1yaa	yup just crust. it not exactly puss..but its a sign that your piercing is healing. just remember to keep cleaning it and wash off the crust. ive had my eyebrow and lip for 5 months..and every now and then theres still crust. =]<br>  nothing bad. <br>  the only time you have to worry is when the crust gets a nasty green/dark yellow color. =]|`|bAYVSfdJaa	ITS CRUST.  I don't think there's a technical term for it, but it just means that your piercings are healing.|`|PLbOiSfyaa	Dead skin cells.<br>  <br>  Make sure to keep it clean!|`|ZCSiACaBaa	if you have had them for a while...it could be because of a start of an infection of changing them or playing with them to often.<br>  <br>  if they are fresh piercings...that is just a way of your body telling you that it is healing and fighting off infection.<br>  it is common for stuff to come out. you also have a foreign object in you and white blood cells go straight to the piercing and try to fight off this unknown object that you body isn't used to.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped...and i hope things clear up:)
Y0w2Pk5kaa	You should have a portfolio. Five is enough but more would be better (10+, your best should be the first 10), as long as they are good photos that show you best (head shot, 3/4 shot, full shot - natural and posed), and make sure you have copies.<br>  <br>  Its good that your wearing heels, not to high, just make sure you can walk comfortably and stong in them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Wear the highest heels you can actually walk in. <br>  <br>  5 pictures should be fine if you have them. If you have a portfolio, then bring that.|`|Nk6NS5Lxaa	There is a great website that tells you what to take, what to wear, what they say, everything...<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <a href="http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/what-should-you-take-with-you-when-you.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/wha...</a><br>  <br>  Oh yes, have a few copies, each one in a separate envelope. No need for a portfolio...
nooi0ldjaa	it'll put you in tears if you get hit by a soccer ball right there after the piercing.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I don't think you should if you're that active.  Surface piercings are notoriously difficult to heal, and on a place that's going to move around a lot, it's an even trickier proposition.  As active as you say you are, I think you'll end up having to take them out pretty soon after having them done due to rejection and irritation.<br>  <br>  If you want something similar, you could get four dermal anchors instead, but keep in mind that those are permanent.  However, they won't reject.<br>  <br>  It's up to you, but I wouldn't waste the money on the surface piercings if I were you.  It's a cool look, but way too difficult to heal and maintain for more than six months to a year.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I would not do it.  i have multiple piercings but it would seem like these would be extremely irritating.  how do you sit down with jeans on?|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	I think its really cute, but since you play soccer it may not be a good idea because it might get ripped out.|`|HZojX6tsaa	its like any other piercing, takes months, even years to heal. you have to be so careful no matter what because your pantline will usually rub, and they can get caught. especially if you play sports. if anything be very concious and dont push yourself if they are irritated.|`|FDXnufOaaa	If u play soccor and skate alot I don't thinkit would be a good idea. You would irritate it alot and you would have a good chance of getting it ripped out since u do those kinds of activities|`|ifnyElN9aa	There is no should or shouldn't, it's your body. there's always risk involving anything, it's just whether you are willing to take the risk. Altho personally I don't like to pierce anything on my body :P|`|WVAd2l7Xaa	Coming from a guy who knows what a sexy chick looks like, I would absolutely say NO! Do not get the hip piercing.<br>  <br>  Belly button piercing is sexy though.|`|OJQqbIu4aa	playing vigorous actives like that will make it reject easily<br>  they never fully heal because they are agitated easliy<br>  i heard the only way of taking them out is to scrap off the skin covering it|`|47yyxtTPaa	i got it it ripped out and scars really bad and rejects it so cute but yea afterawhile its blah|`|wImYypazaa	Well if you play sports it may be a bad idea|`|4lTsTliJaa	oh my gosh. that gives me the willies.|`|c5FSGxxqaa	thats gross.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	The trend is stupid, if you ask me.  You look young.  No piercers will perform them on minors, so us this time to do some research on them and decide if thy fit your life style or not before you waste your money on them.
VHaSKFC2aa	If you're self conscious about it then I would suggest wearing one.<br>  <br>  And no, you don't have to be gay to wear one, sheesh, some people.<br>  <br>  There are certain types of "bras" for men, typically they look more like sports bras just for the sheer fact that you'd want to flatten them down instead of actually support them. <br>  <br>  I hope my link helps.

A bra offers him support and he will be much more comfortable wearing one. Bras made for girls and women should be fine for most boys, but some boys or men might be more comfortable wearing bras made especially for men. Check out the 1st link I provided for bras made for men and if a boy is just starting to develop breasts or just wants to wear a training bra made for men check out the next 2 links  I've included where they have training bras made especially for men.|`|fW029NAXaa	He should really invest in a trainer, not a bra!  You can usually get rid of Moobs unless you're over 40 - less coke and crisps, more walking / running and some weights (ask at your local sports centre).|`|q34vCB3Qaa	you mean a bro?|`|y2O1D8q7aa	wait are you being serious? because im actually laughing hahha<br>  <br>  but, um. no dont. because people will think your a transvestite. but theres nothing wrong with being one.|`|xO0IjDpNaa	No b/c then its going to really look like they have boobs lol.|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	No. Is this boy gender confused?|`|ftvPJfEXaa	What the??|`|maAarsJxaa	no...
KMASS2Gmaa	Are you still losing weight? It has been more than ten days since you started and that tells me there could be something seriously wrong. I used to be an EMT and was trained to help the Corpsman in the Coast Guard. So while I am not repeat NOT a Doctor I have enough medical training to request you go see a competent Doctor. It is wrong for a healthy boy your age to lose weight like this. You say you are eating and one of your other questions indicated vertigo. This is serious or potentially so. Please see a physician soonest. If your dad gives you crap tell him to tell it to the Doctor because otherwise you will report him for with holding medical attention. I hate to come across as an A$$HOLE but this could be life threatening so please get some help.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	Actually getting it trimmed will help make it healthier looking because it gets rid of the split ends. Just don't get it cut to short. You can ask the stylist what you would suggest for minor hair loss though, they have tons of tricks and tips and they can even tell you what style would help out. Good Luck :)|`|DxiXJXsoaa	Getting a hair cut shouldn't make it worse.<br>  In fact, a hair cut usually will have the opposite effect - your hair will look thicker, and since there won't be so much weight and strain on your scalp, the new hair will be stronger and begin to grow back in.<br>  I think you should seriously consider a haircut.|`|xV2AsD2daa	You might consider getting Nioxin shampoo and conditioner plus their other products they have for hair loss. It promotes the hair that grows back to be healthier and to my understanding stops or slows down additional hair loss. A hair cut would make your hair look thicker especially if it was a blunt cut.

Others wear dance tights.  <br>  <br>  You should be able to get those tights online via amazon.com.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|wXvLwvRbaa	i thinkkk special tights / leggings ..|`|YTasscmKaa	Those were special tights with a high lycra content.|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	they are danskin which are still used to today for show choir
Xpj8Mn2laa	Yep for sure. Probably wont go with a gothic style choker/ dog collar :P :P I wear my diamond earrings all the time.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	yup.|`|yRtPyDyjaa	Yes you can wear your diamonds over just anything. But at least the holders must match. That way it wont look mismatched.
0792099af4d32f715881d4a39d91aee9aa	They require what they call "virgin hair" meaning it has nothing on it and it's your own natural hair.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	The places that make wigs for people that have cancer would love to have your hair.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	locks of love. pantene uses it for more commercial purposes from what i've heard. but the parts with blond highlights cannot be donated. you have to cut out or remove those parts.|`|3Fma3URSaa	Yes. I think they except highlighted hair.<br>  If you want to make sure check out their website.|`|T5EOJrVZaa	i think they like undyed hair but  you can always call or email them and ask|`|AvqQt5zNaa	I am pretty sure you need to have virgin, not dyed/bleached, hair.|`|iNXGb3jUaa	you can still donate your hair as long it meets the length guidelines which is usually 12 to 16 inches, color, high-lites really don't matter as long as the blonde isn't damaged.|`|qusnP8ujaa	i wanted to donate my 7 inches of hair to locks of love but they wouldn't let me because it has to be virgin hair...i had highlights also.<br>  its very unlikely you can donate it.|`|x1fp1vESaa	well i donated my hair for locks of love a year ago so as long as the amount you donate is i think 10 inches or more to be donated and not bleached and looks natural|`|QG7g2s7oaa	Bleached hair can't be donated. And chances are, your hair was bleached to have highlights put in.<br>  <br>  For locks of love, anyways.|`|eCtrOR3Baa	Were the highlights done with bleach? I believe the website for Locks of Love state that  bleached hair is ok, dyed is not.|`|S87IzRxdaa	Yes. As long as they look natural.

5h51YQPiaa	you have really pretty hair but i think you should cut your side bangs shorter and angle your hair so its shorter in the front.<br>  that would look really cute :)|`|ejelObdJaa	omgggg !! i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ur hairrrrrr !!!!! <br>  <br>  u sould cut ur bangs a lil & ull be okayy :]|`|cwOsmJDLaa	i think either of these would work:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m225/kech2010/Hair%20Cuts/HAIR.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m225/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm20/Katgrrrrrrr/Cute%20hair%20cuts/ch-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm20/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w270/mccartneylover_93/Hair%20cuts%20I%20want/normal_358_1hayley_williams_paramor.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w270/...</a>|`|iNXGb3jUaa	your hair is really pretty if you cut it shorter i wouldn't go above your shoulders i think layers would be good but not to high up or you'll look like a mushroom you could always do a side bang but don't take it above your cheek bone cause when their dry they will shrink up|`|hkqrkpD7aa	I like your hair already! I think short bangs would work.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	i love your hair! leave it alone don't mess with it :)|`|OnTXgFx1aa	i like it the way it is but yes, shorter bangs would work and more layers would too, although i dont know how theyll look with curly hair|`|MUhNwBbdaa	try a cross fringe :P|`|41S75G5Eaa	omfg i flippin LOVE your hair!!!!!!<br>  if you cut it too short you might regret it, <br>  lol  it happend to me   =]
91TxX375aa	Well, it depends on which notch you're using.  If you're using the tightest one, then you need to loosen it.  There is somehow too mush stress on it.  You may need to go a size bigger or use an extension, found at any fabric store.|`|C9FHwL3Kaa	It might be because your boobs are too large for the bra and you might need a size up.|`|zXYuZ2UFaa	Maybe now the 38D is 2 small for u maybe u went up 2 a  DD (double d)|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	sounds its like the wrong size bra strap|`|YPs00PQHaa	yeah, maybe you should get fited at like vitorias secret or something, because the only thing i can think of its it not fitting
ZabhfIGraa	Eight weeks is normal.  Just remember for each month, your hair normally grows 1/2 inch so in two months (8 weeks) it will be one inch longer and your stylist can determine if only half of that needs to be trimmed again.|`|iNXGb3jUaa	8 weeks is best if you go in for regular trims and trims i mean just cutting the ends, your hair will grow quicker.you did the right thing by getting 3 inches taken off cause now all the damage is off  keep the cuts regular, a year is to long for a cut but your on the right track keep it up.|`|b4s7j9xGaa	Well when that 8 weeks come see if ur hair needs it and go from there!
i8Pl0Pejaa	If you really want to cover them up (they're so cute don't do it) Then you could probably use liquid foundations from either MAC or Sephora, both are realy good, and can cover up pretty much everything.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO COVER UP THE FRECKLES.   THEY TRULLY ARE A POINT OF BEAUTY...   GUYS LOVE GIRLS WITH FRECKLES....
