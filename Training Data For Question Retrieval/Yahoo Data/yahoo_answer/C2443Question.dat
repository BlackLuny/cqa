20090223035134AADPpXD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is the Aging/Ageing Potion (from HP) temporary?	Dorky question here :)      Remember the Aging Potion the Weasley Twins drank to fool the Age Line around the Goblet of Fire in the fourth book/movie?       I was wondering: were the effects of the potion temporary? If so, how much time do you think they'd last?      I remember the twins being sent to the Infirmary, so if the potion's effects can only be reversed by another potion/antidote could those effects be permanent?      Also, in which year do you think that potion was taught?       The twins were in sixth year if I remember correctly, and Hermione knew if, and she was in fourth. Still, Hermione knows everything so that's not very helpful.      Thanks in advance!
20090223034810AAuWy9s	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your opinion on the preface of my book? (yet to be published)?	Students are constantly misinformed that everything changes. Does everything change? Can you identify and prove that x = x if the things by which everything is identified do not remain the same? Can you identify and prove that x ≠ y if the things by which everything is identified change?  One could identify and prove that “every constant is a variable” if the things by which everything is identified do not remain the same.       This writing is to refute the statement that everything changes. One who attempts prove that “everything changes” can identify nothing and prove no thing through search and research. You can never identify that which you search for if no thing remains the same. No one can ever prove that which can never be the same.        The statement “everything changes” is set to impeach the first principle of science that “the total energy of the universe remains the same.” No thing can be changed except the order in which those which can neither be created nor be destroyed exist. Every thing except the order remains the same. Everything except the order can never be disordered. No thing can be conserved if everything changes.        The propaganda “everything changes” is propagated by individuals who want to ‘prove and maintain’ their ‘intellectual supremacy’ by tampering the normal intellectual development of fellowmen and women. They need to tamper the normal intellectual development of fellowmen and women in order to prove their intellectual supremacy. They need to prove their intellectual supremacy in order to have the sanctioned authority to manipulate the intelligence of fellowmen and women. They need to manipulate the intelligence of fellowmen and women in order to make the fellowmen and women to be their puppets. They want to make sure that their intellectual supremacy and their claims on the “professional invention and innovations of new things” are assessed and questioned by none of their fellowmen and women. No analysis and judugement can be made on the dubious claims on the invention & evolution of ideas by those who fail to look for the things that remain the same. A search for the things that remains the same will lead anyone to make the statement that "no thing except the order is new even if everything changes.       The ‘so-called’ universal law which states that “everything changes” is set to impair one’s ability to search, identify, classify, relate, question, study, describe and explain the different things. How does the statement "everything changes" impair the normal human intellectual development?          The statement “everything changes” directly instructs and compels the learners not to look for the things which remain the same like the ideas with which everything is questioned, the universals, the logic, and the other analytical principles. The ideas with which one searches, identifies, classifies, relates, questions, studies, describes and explains the different things remain the same. Students may find this writing useful in discerning the ideas with which one searches, identifies, classifies, relates, questions, studies, describes and explains the different things.       Refute and remove the universals, constants, principles, and logic from your science and philosophy if you aspire to prove that “everything changes.”        You are encouraged to reedit and redistribute this writing if you find this can be presented in a better manner to the benefit of humanity.

I remember one time I was buying some sypmtahy cards from this store and this lady clerk shared with me how her daughter have been acting and she went in great depth with me. I gave her some advice but she felt so comfortable like nothing.       for ex.    I can be out with ppl I know, I can strike up a conversation with ppl I dont know, where's the person I'm with would ask me do I know them. Im thinking I dont have to know them to talk to them, that's how you get to know ppl. I have always been friendly and feel what ever going to happen happens.       If we really can prevent something we wouldn't have accident. for example maybe if they would of had on their seat belts? if they did, and a truck was coming at them side ways do you STILL think the seatbelts would of done any good.       I believe the light is to be followed and EVERYTHING HAPPEN FOR A REASON.      I feel like Im related to the universe and very trustworthy and trust others.

In reply to this question:   At the time the Spartacists were the a real threat to the  Social Democrats, but to the German people the Spartacists were too left wing; they were too extreme. The people of Germany wanted moderate change, they wanted capitalism. After World War I Germany suffered a somewhat economic crisis and capitalism offered Germany the chance to regain the rich standards which existed before the war.      That's basically one of my points for this essay.   I sort of need help EXPANDING it and also i need to include research in it, so like evidence but i can't seem to find a lot of websites that help.

It started off as 1 thing then changed into something else         The open window.         Its always open,      day and night.      I can hear the cyotes,      frisk and fight.      During the summer,      it glows with light,      But dring the winter,      It gives me fright.      The rain pounding,      and and the wind blowing,      I think my emotional side,      is finally showing.      I hear a tip then a tap,      What was that?      I dont know,      Im kinda scared,      I see a figure move on in.      Its getting closer, im freaking out.      The light gos on and then I shout....      I kick and scream and hit all about,      My mom runs in and then she out,      Next my dad but hes too late,      Im gone, Im never to be found.

I am learning flamenco from an extremely ameture level. I am a ballet dancer, and in ballet i have no problem performing and expressing passion, but i stuggle so much with this in flamenco. Its probably because i am new, but is The passion something that clicks one day, is it gradual as you become more famililar with the style, or is it something i should suck it up and just do? I find the style very difficult but i am enjoying it! i just look like a bit of a tool at times!

I am 13 years old, but I have a high reading age, I had a reading age of 19 when I was in year 7, at the beginning of the year, so I was 11, I am desperate for a good read, I felt I should read the twilight series as that's what the children in school were reading,  I completed them in ten days, and they were okay, I hate Harry Potter, because I feel J.K Rowling writes terribly, she is a good story teller, but her books bore me to tears, I have read a few Books by Mark Haddon, and I thoroughly enjoyed them, My favourite was the curious incident of the dog in the night time, I read it when I was 9 or 10. I really loved elsewhere by gabrielle zevin, my favourite children's book, I read the No.1 women's detective agency series, which I also enjoyed,   any suggestions on what I could read, I need something to take to my English Library lessons too, because the books are written for children, full of rubbish like, 'he loves me, he hates me, I know, I'll paint my nails, dress like a slut and wear 2 feet high heels to get his attention' that is what everyone in school is reading, I'm not in school today, as we are on inset, I'm planning on popping down to the library to take out 3 or 4 books, to keep me busy for the next few weeks....   does anyone have any suggestions??   thanks.x.

20090223001055AAs1SDq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	It is for my college english class. I am not a good write AT ALL, so that is why it is bad. lol. I jsut wanted some input. Thanks :]                     I stand in my bedroom packing all my things and labeling the boxes. I can’t believe this. If you were to tell my on my wedding day that my husband was going to ask me for a divorce because he fell in love with another women, I would never have believed you. And now this is a reality, my happy marriage is now over, and I am part of a statistic.   The worst part of this all is that I have to move out of the house of my dreams because he is going to move in his new girlfriend.   After seeing countless houses, I fell in love with this one. It has a huge front with a gorgeous garden, and a huge backyard with a beautiful pool and patio. On the outside it is white with a big red door, dark blue shutters, and a white picket fence bordering the whole property. The inside is just as beautiful. All the rooms are spacious. There is a cozy living room, a magnificent dining room, a warm inviting kitchen, four decent size bedrooms, and three full bathrooms. This house was perfect for the family that I planned to have, but now none of that was going to happen.   While waiting for the movers to come and help me move out, I think of a crazy idea to kill time. So I go into the refrigerator and grab the left over shrimp scampi that I made for dinner two days ago. I go into every room and take down the curtain rods. I put a few shrimp into the hallow rod and recap it and place it back on the window. I know that I must look crazy doing this, but I cant just pack my things and leave. He cheated on me, he took my house, he made my dream of a family impossible, and I don’t want him and his new girlfriend to be happy in my dream house. The movers get here, and as I am leaving with the last box I just laugh to myself thinking of what this house is going to smell like in less than a weeks time.   The husband came home with his new girlfriend, and was happy his wife was gone, and didn’t take too much with her. They both lived in bliss for a few days, and then the smell started to kick in.   They had no idea where this smell was coming from. They cleaned the whole house, aired it out, checked the vents for dead animals, replaced all the carpets with hardwood flooring, and even hired an exterior to try and figure out what was causing the smell. The weird thing was that the smell was getting worse and worse.   No one would come over their house anymore, and it was at the point where the husband and his girlfriend couldn’t stand the smell. So finally they decided to move to a new house.   Two months later, they still can’t sell their house, even though with they multiple price cuts they are practically giving it away. No one wanted to buy the stinky house, and no relater wanted anything to do with it. Finally the husband decided to take out a loan from the bank and move without selling the house.    The wife was looking through the paper and saw that her house was on the market, at an unbelievably low price. She called her husband and ask what was going on. He told her that the house must have a fungus or something because it smells unbearable. As the wife listens to him she cant help but smile at this opportunity.   “I’ll but the house,” she tells him, “at the price you are selling it for and in return I will sign the divorce papers.”   The husband thinking that his, now ex-wife, is not the sharpest crayon in the box happily agrees.   A week later she watches her ex-husband and his new wife, from the window of her newly bought house, climb into the moving truck with everything packed, curtain rods and all.

I'm not sure if I'm aloud to do this but I'm making a version from antoher perspective. The main girl, Christabell / Chrissy is my character and her parents Isaac and Karrie and her friends are mine too. I bring in the Cullens later, and I give credit to Stephanie Meyer. I'm not going to publish it or anything, I'm just wondering if anyone likes it and wants to read more... here it is :) (it's only the first couple of paragraphs.) :       My parents gave me up the day I was born. I spent the total my life in the Roman Adoption Center. I hadn't planned on staying this long, I expected a someone, anyone to come and find me suffering here soon. Who knew, I had no family to go to. I could stay untill it was my 18th birthday. I don't think I can manage much longer...   I learned to be polite to the orphan keepers, even though they treated us all like hackey-sacks. I also learned to be friendly to my room mates, if anyone got in a fight here, it would be just a waste of time. The house keepers forced us to be the best of friends. This however, was not easy at all. At all. The kids were terrible. They didn't listen to a thing you said and blamed every trouble they did on someone. But of course, I just had to be their target.    I turned ten years old a few months ago. Ten years at this place I called home. So called home. I wouldn't give even my worst enemy this punishment. I just might think I myself was my own worst enemy at this point. I can litterly drive myself crazy sometimes, not to mention my room mates.   My dream came one afternoon. My first actual dream -and not one of my many nightmares. The couple that's been on my mind for... for forever. They came. Not even the slightest hope for me though. I was unbelivably lucky just to see outsiders for a change. And the tiny bit of sunshine that came in with them. A small peice of the world... the world I would never see.   They took only 5 steps towards me, Me, and chose me to be theirs. Me, I thought, Of all of us, me... no. There must be some one behind me. They were too beautiful, like people off of magazines. Unhumanly beautiful. There was no way...   "Do you speak English, child?" asked the woman. "Umm...mhmm... uh, no, wait. Yes ma'am." I tried to say politley, yet my imperfection caught me... again. I was scared, no, terrified that my stammering would turn them off to another child. "What is your name, young one?" spoke the man. I wasn't that young... "Christabell... uhhh..." Did I even have a last name? To think I should know my last name... "Christabell, uhh.. you can call me Chrissy... if you please, sir" They were oblivious to my heart racing out of my chest, I thought the Chinese could hear it. "My name is Isaac, this is my wife, Karrie. We were looking to adopt a child this afternoon, would you mind if we chose you to become apart of our family?" I was sure China could hear me now.   The checking out of the orphanage took very little time. Surprising, I wouldv'e thought it would take alot longer... no one got checked out in years. I was the first one in a long time to be chosen. People usually came in and out looking for a child, they never found anyone here. We were the imperfect. The keepers of this place fed us the three meals of the day. Breakfast, we have poridge, cold poridge. Lunch, we have a peice of bread, sometimes... I wasn't even sure it was fresh... Supper, I never actually did find out what it was. Thats why we were as thin as a twig. As weak as a twig, too. That's why no one chose us. But that didn't matter now. I was going to have a family. A sweet, loving family.   In a moment we were out of the old orphanage and into the streets of Rome, Italy. This all happend too fast, but I wasn't complaining about anything. The quicker I got out of my old home the better. There parked a nice, expensive car. I knew nothing about cars, or their expense. So what would I know. I looked fast though. It made me dizzy looking at it, and it wasn't even moving yet. I hopped in and asked how to roll the windows down. My imperfection again.   The children scurried over to the windows to give me their farewells. Yeah, hahaha... I laughed to myself. Rub it in, rub it in, I thought. I was actually chosen to become a family member to two beautiful people. My Mother and Father. I loved how that sounded.    My former room mates were screaming and waving their hands good-bye. I rolled down the windows and shook the hair out of my face dramatically. "Bye, Chrissy! We love you!" shouted a harmony of voices. Right... love me now... I can't blame them though. I'd been a bother, I thought. What am I thinking... The car began to pull away. I stook my tongue out at them and laughed. My life starts... as the car pulled away from the Roman Adoption Center ...now.

Every book is worse than its predecessor. The way Bella acted with Jacob in New Moon was expectable because it was over with Edward but she continues to act that way toward Jacob even when Edward Returns. If she really loved Edward she wouldn’t be a slut with Jacob. So my question is do you like the twilight Sequels? In my opinion this book is a horror novel not a love story. Edward is the Victim and the gay dog Jacob and the HO Bella are the killers. The only decent characters in the books are the vampires.

For this kind of thing I'd normally use the Clone Stamp tool but I'm afraid that it would look unrealistic on something as big as footprints.      Any ideas?   Thanks in advance. =)

20090223050520AAS9CtM	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is this little paragraph on humans are no selfish good!!?	Human behaviour by nature will always and forever will be altruistic. Humans have long-term altruistic behaviours such as parenting, caring for the sick or injured, and protecting family and comrades among times of conflicts and war. Such behaviour requires great’s amount of sacrifice in time, effort, health and even life itself. Altruism is naturally built in humans because infants as young as 18 months show natural tendencies to help someone. Altruism is argued to be a distinctive human function that is entrenched within our brains. Latest studies tell us that altruism is a very powerful human trait that might have been present within us for more than 6 million years from a familiar ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Joseph butler a philosopher exercised his theory based on happiness. He insisted that everyone pursues happiness as the one and only ultimate end. This happiness doesn’t follow that people are selfish or unable to have real love of others. He persists that many times we like to seek certain things for our own desires and affections and not just the satisfaction of being able to fulfil them or for own pleasure. Such an example is hunger is a desire for food and not the sensations of indulging it, or during loneliness people want friends, and not the feelings these friends give you. One of our affections for others is love and that it is a strong desire for the welfare of the other person. Thus the happiness that we contain is a happiness shared for the good of all our loved ones and not just for our own. We feel satisfaction, enjoyment and happiness when we help someone and by making them happy. Altruists are happy when people flourish and sad when others are in misery. In every part of human society, altruism is a selfless worry for the good of the other person. Many people go out of their own comfort zones, ignoring the hope of rewards and the greatest risk for themselves is to help the others who are in need.          please tell me, im using this for a school debate thanks! i has issues trying to get this together.

20090223052919AA4XMrY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help with this story I'm writing..?	I'm making my story a graphic novel. It's set in Germany during WWII.. And I've got some ideas put out, but I'm just not sure about some stuff and am looking for some opinions.. Help?      The two main characters are a boy and girl [same age.. Maybe share the same birthday or something?];      Boy;   Named Hans, very thin, tall but muscular, has rosey cheeks and pale skin, has soft, whispy locks of lemon coloured hair and glacier blue eyes, he voluntarily wears lederhosen and likes to sing, and be alone unless it's with his friend [the girl.] He has a sister and two brothers and lives with his parents on a farm somewhere in Bavaria. His nose and cheeks are sprinkled with little freckles.      Girl; I can't decide on a name. Look below at my ideas..      Her cheeks are also rosey likes Hans's, only she's not as pale. She has emerald green eyes that look like the leaves of the forest she so happily runs through all day. Her hair is also blonde, but is more of a strawberry blonde colour. Her hair is quite long and quite thick, unlike Hans's thin strands of angel-hair. She is shorter than Hans, and lots of other children their age [nothing too short..] She lives with her parents too, her grandmother and she has no siblings. They also live in Bavaria, but more by the trees and more away from the town they live in.      --   Ideas for the girl's name;   -Lisanne [Lis-on]   -Joanna [Yo-anna]   -Ada [Ah-duh]   -Ailsa [Ale-suh]   -Brigitte [Brig-ee-tah]   -Charlotte   -Ella    -Frieda [Free-duh]   -Freja [Frey-ah]   -Helena [Hel-ay-nuh]   -Katja [Kat-ee-uh]   -Katrin [Cat-reen]   -Klara      ..   I originally going to name her Joanna, but I'm not sure if that flows well with 'Hans..'? Now I like Lisanne a lot, or maybe Ella or Katrin.. How about you? Do you have any suggestions?      --      OKAY. HERE'S MY PLOT. SORRY x]      So, maybe it could start off with the girl just beginning guitar lessons [before she's started school, which she will start like a few weeks after she starts guitar.. So she's like 5] and her guitar teacher is a young Jewish lady, and then she gets taken away, and later in life the girl will find out why, and then never have a really positive way of thinking for the Nazi government? Anyways; So when school starts, she meets this boy Hans and they both dislike each other, but somehow keep getting assaigned as parters or whatever and end up really liking each other and turning into best friends.. So like, most of the book will be about like, their adventures together as children, since they spend pretty much their entire childhood together [any ideas for an adventure?]       Maybe at some point they kiss as friends or something?       So I was thinking, like, all their lives they've agreed on the same things.. And one thing they always agreed on was that Nazis were horrible people and they liked to make fun of them..   Well, maybe when they're teenagers Hans could totally change his mind and feel so 'blessed' for being so 'aryan' and is glad his parents made him be a Hitler Youth for his childhood [even though he originally didn't like it at all..] and then sometime in 1945, when the Russians are moving in and everything and the the country is desperate for soldiers, they send Hans [maybe his brothers too] to fight in Berlin.. And the girl/Hans never say goodbye to each other since they're in a fight? And then Hans maybe could like, write a letter to her saying he's sorry and agrees with her after what he's seen.. And then later on the town gets informed about who from their town has died, and Hans [and his brothers?] all have died?      I could make it really sad like that.. What do you think? Any suggestions? PLEASE give me a detailed answer! THANK YOU!

I watched the movie Twilight very reluctantly yesterday (long story why) I haven't read the books, because i really don't actually read stories based on the supernatural and love. I love Harry Potter, but that's not my question. My question is, I sort of liked the movie and is the book much better or about the same? the thing is, I know a lot of the story line already from friends who talk about it so I dunno if it's worth reading. Many people who i know have read the books, say the first book is really good, but then it gets really horrible. Is that true? Are the books worth reading?

I'm not to bad at poetry, not saying i'm anything special, but i can do it.      So why do i find it so hard to write a story?   I'm not wanting it to be anything spectacular, just to be able to write one and be pleased that i have done it, for myself.      Anybody have any ideas/pointers etc...

20090223060035AAd7HmT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Reconciliation ( the thoughts of a sleep deprived little girl, looking for answers, nothing more, nothing less?	I often times finding myself alone, sad, despondent, and I wonder why would  a Supreme being allow me to feel that way quite often?  That is the real reason I left the church, and declared myself faithless.  But in all honesty, more reasons grew on me over time, and I drifted farther and farther from what the average person would probably call morality.  But looking back, I don't regret leaving, I regret why I left, and logically speaking, the reasoning for no God is more probable than the argument for his existence.  But for our one planet, to be in the "Goldilocks Zone" from the sun, to have the basic elements needed to create amino acids, survive long enough without a major catastrophe to the point where Humans evolved from what came from the "primordial soup", is a mind boggling leap of faith, which is ironic because that is just what it is trying to dispel, faith.  And sometimes I feel that a God of some sort is more likely that he/she/it set the key events in motion to lead to the creation of man, whether it be direct as the Christian faith believes it, or subtle enough not to leave a trace of what it had accomplished.  Either way, I see myself losing a grasp on the belief that we are a random product of a random explosion, in essence.  There just seems to be too much left to chance, and I'm not the person to leave loose ends, and the idea of God making us, with whatever intention he may have, is gaining credibility in my mind.  Be it that he is the God of the Deists, or the God of the Muslims, pieces are just not coming together without something to set them in motion.  And on the topic of Hell, well in most religions I am already damned, but I pay no heed to it.  All in all, these are just the thoughts of a sleep deprived little girl, looking for answers, nothing more, nothing less.

20090223001901AAMyAra	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Wat do u think of this story?	ok so my friend wrote this awesome story and i want to know your opinion ok             You were working one day at this old run down cafe you were walking out because your shift was over you were walking to your car.  As you were driving home your car sputtered to a halt you called your neighbor to come pick you up the tow truck arrives and out of one side a really preppy guy hops out you know him its....Jason the captain of the football team.   "GOD ____ CANT YOU TAKE CARE OF A CAR!!"      "not my fault my friend said he would help but he moved"      "I don't care just grab the chain"      As you grab the rusty chain it cuts your hand you run into the truck to the first-aid kit after you cleaned the cut Jason hopped in and told you he would take you home.  You thought this was different he hated you but that mood came back when he really kicked you out of cab of the truck and drove off laughing you had fallen funny and you eared a crunch you were sure you had broken your wrist luckily your friend was there about to curse you out for calling and not showing up but when she saw you she helped you into her car and drove you to the ER.  There you had to sit on one of their creepy hospital beds to wait for the X-Ray you put your head down when they sat somebody next to you.  You looked over your shoulder it was a hot emo guy getting stitches on his arm and forehead you sat up and sat facing him, he blushed and sort of moved to angle himself towards you.      "So what happened to you?"      "I got pushed out of a car and broke my arm, you?"      "I was riding my board fell off the ramp and got my arm caught in the ramp and it.... well you can see."      As you were just about to ask him what his name was they came back with your X-Ray, it was broken BAD they were going to get a type of splint under the cast but it was going to be PAINFUL to put on you wished your friend had stayed but she left you they took you into the back and put you in a creepy room you guessed sound proof.  Right as they were prepping you he walked in and held your hand with his good arm.      "The names Sam"      "____"      "Pretty name but this is not going to be pretty squeeze if it get to be to much pain"      Right then they started putting it on instead of hurting you new friend Sam you screamed but he covered your mouth with his and squeezed your hand a little you squeezed his hand back until it was done you got a lime green cast they made James leave while they wrapped your wrist.  You were sure he had left as you were walking out all you could think of was that kiss how wonderful it was.  You were outside now when a Black Jeep was parked in front of you it was his he had the door opened and patted the seat for you to sit down.    "How did you know I was going to scream?      "I have had the same break before"      "Oh I am.....glad you were there"      "Well......nobody as pretty as you should ever be in pain so I thought I would dull the pain"      "Well it worked."      You turned to kiss his cheek he turned to kiss your cheek your lips met with sparks, no not sparks FIREWORKS.  He told you he would drive you home if you told him where to go, when he stopped in front of your house he reached in front of you and grabbed a sharpie and wrote his # on your cast.  You kissed his cheek and grabbed the sharpie from him and wrote your # on his arm.  He walked you to your doorstep and kissed you again you walked inside and looked back he was walking backwards to his car while blowing kisses at you you pretended to catch them.  You knew it was cheesy but you was the keeper of your heart now, you did not care how silly he acted.  He stopped and got into his car a pulled something out then you heard your phone go off you opened it he was calling you.    "I miss you, I love you"      "Sam we just met Love is a strong word"      "Oh yeah I forgot go and look at your second grade class picture."   You looked.      "Okay now look next to you the little boy holding your hand."   You dropped the picture it was...... your Sam from secong grade til 8th grade when he moved you cried for weeks because he was your first kiss, your first love.  You ran outside and hugged him.      "Your back!"   "Forever honey and I am never leaving"      He pointed to the house two doors down that had been for sale that now was sold you kissed him for what seemed to be forever.   He was yours forever he grabbed your left and and put a ring on the ring finger it said "be my forever".      "Its not a wedding ring its a forever ring because I want you to be mine till the day the sun burns out"      "I would love that"      The rest of your life is up to you!

20090223071541AATN3VR	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please rate my poem....?	Every tear leaves a scar   Nothing's fair when love's at war   Ailing memories throng the day   That beautiful page ceases to stay   How callously she scripts my grief   The soiled green of a fallen leaf   My sinless breath warms her name   Love aint't just blind,it's also lame   The mourning throes raze my song   Those subtle scores just grow along   Her crashing echoes choke my spate   And i cede my soul to the might of fate

I looked around but there was nothing in sight. That was when i felt an arm around me. Blackness closed over me and i felt cold water on my back. I could feel blood from my hand and the sharpness of what was cutting through it. I was aware of nothing but the pain and the confusion...

He thought this was a threat. I kept my expression nonchalant while he shouted brusque assumptions at my direction. He pounded his fists on the table. It didn't bring any dramatic effect that he was hoping for. Then there was something that i was not expecting. My heart pounded and beads of sweat rolled down my face ...

20090223071136AAaCxOo	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Amatuer Guitar Player, Help!?	Im a 15 year old guitar player, I've been playing for 5 years. I have an Epiphone LP-100 running through their standard tube amp. For my birthday, I decided I wanted to finally get a pedal, however, I have no clue how to approach this. I narrowed it down to either a wah pedal or a distortion pedal,  but I don't know which one is a better buy or is more valuable, and I know nothing about brands or quality.      What pedal should I get? (Budget is $100 at most)   Suggestions and comments are appreciated.      Thank you.
