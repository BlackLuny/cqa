Okay, im starting a diet, but i have one big fault in my design, I cant seem to stop eating all the food      I mean, every time i'm doing something, i always think of food, and always give in! I dont mean to, but i cant help it in the end.      And when im out with friends in town (for example) and i walk pass a fast food resturant, i always go in, and even my friends now think i should see someone about my eating habbits. And to top it offf, im also an emotional eater, so i eat when im bored (without thinking) and now, everything i do is either food or to do with food! I need help!!      Any suggestions? Thanks

Voici la base de cette recette facile :       - Prévoir une escalope de poulet par personne,   - La couper en dés,   - Couper autant de jambon blanc en dés de même taille que ceux de poulet,   - Couper une omelette épaisse (éventuellement légèrement sucrée) en dés,   - Couper des cubes de poire (en volume équivalent au poulet)   - Couper des oignons nouveaux (autant en volume qu'il y a de poulet) en tranches épaisses,   - Hacher finement un peu de gingembre,   - Casser un oeuf, le verser sur le poulet, bien mélanger, puis rajouter de la farine dans le mélanger. Continuer à mélanger pour que chaque cube de poulet soit bien enveloppé d'oeuf+farine,   - Faire légérement sauter les cubes de poulet dans l'huile, jusqu'à blanchiment,   - Retirer le poulet, et le remplacer dans la poelle par le reste des ingrédients,   - Les faire sauter,   - Ajouter le poulet en fin de cuisson. Faire sauter tout en mélangeant. Tout retirer.   - Aromatiser le tout en versant un peu d'huile de sésame.   Déguster avec riz et/ou pates.
