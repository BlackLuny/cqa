BDUNKSTYaa	Dipende dall'arredamento. Deve essere una tonalità che accosta bene ai colori che ci sono già. Puoi fare ad esempio una parete sull'arancio o aragosta e le altre pareti giallo chiaro, risalta molto e a me piace: qui ci stanno bene delle cose blu o arancione....ad esempio i divani, ....  un pò di verde con qualche pianta...comunque io opterei per colori decisi, dimostrano carattere.|`|D2OThhbCaa	Troppo vaga la tua domanda,dipende dall'arredo,dai colori già presenti,dallo stile della tua casa,da che effetto vuoi ottenere...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	falle a spugna...o magari disegnaci sopra...il colore?ovvio...del colore che ti sembra più rilassante!|`|7j87Jh3eaa	Di che colore vedi la tua stanza? Per vivere in un ambiente confortevole è giusto assecondare i propri gusti nella scelta cromatica. Che pare rifletta anche la nostra personalità. Negli accostamenti bisogna fare attenzione alle sfumature. E considerare anche che la stessa tinta su un abito, nell'arredamento o alle pareti può assumere un aspetto del tutto diverso.GIALLO: Spirito giovane, dopo il rosso pare sia il colore preferito dai bambini, soprattutto nelle tonalità più brillanti ed intense. Nelle proposte più attuali tendono al giallo ocra ed arancione. Hai bisogno di una casa solare, lumiosa e allegra dove invitare spesso gli amici? si dice infatti che il giallo sia il colore che rappresenta l'allegria, la giovinezza, l'estroversione. E' adatto a tutti i locali, eccetto la camera da letto perchè ha un effetto poco rilassante. A meno che non si usino tonalità molto tenui e morbide. VIOLA: Di ultima tendenza, dall'abbigliamento all'arredamento, è una delle proposte cromatiche più viste nelle ultime collezioni. Per gli interni sono indicate le tonalità più chiare, come il viola-grigio o il lilla. Lo scegli perchè ti piace cambiare e vuoi che anche la casa sia al passo con i tempi. Maglio però non esagerare. In una stanza basta un solo elemento, per esempio il divano, coordinato a qualche cuscino. Nella tonalità polvere si può accostare al verde acido o al blu e a essenze legnose molto chiare, come acero sbiancato o betulla per un effetto fresco, o al wengé per un ambiente più caldo.VERDE: spesso si trova in ambienti di gusto country o in salotti classici, abbinato a giallo e oro. Ma negli ultimi anni, il verde acido è entrato anche nell'arredamento così detto minimal. Se è vero che il verde è speranza, chi ama il verde é probabilmente una persona ottimista. Che predilige anche la primavera, una stagione che dà carica ed energia, come questo colore.In tonalità pastello si può abbinare con tessuti neutri e legni chieri come rovere sbiancato, creano un'ottimo atmosfera calda ed accogliente ma allo stesso tempo rilassante per la camera da letto. ROSSO: Molto tradizionalista o decisamente audace. nei toni bordeaux e pompeiano questo colore è adatto infatti ad ambienti classici, mentre nelle sfumature più accese si abbina bene ai grigi o ai metalli cromati.Anche un pò etnico, il rosso lacca è anche il colore di molti complementi di stile orientale; in tonalità piùtosto scure e con finitura opaca, viene spesso usato per tinteggiare le pareti, anche una sola, di ambienti etnici. I rossi che tendono al blu stanno bene con il blu stesso, i viola, i grigi, il bianco. mentre quelli in cui predomina il colore terra sono lo sfondo ideale per i mobili in legno, di essenze calde come il noce.BLU: Nelle tonalità più tenui, è indicato per dipingere le pareti, per i rivestimenti tessili e la biancheria. E' anche uno dei colori più utilizzati per le piastrelle dei bagni. La tua personalità è calma , tranquilla, introspettiva. Quello che ami è l'armonia, soprattutto nell'ambiente domestico, che è anche il luogo dove cerchi relax. Sicuramente il bianco è l'accostamento che meglio si addice a ogni sfumatura di blu. E poi gli azzurri. La tonalità avio sta bene anche ai marroni oppure alla gamma dei beige.  Spero di averti dato un'idea su come scegliere i colori giusti! Buona pittura e buon divertimento!!!|`|CxUUfRGOaa	beh dipende dall arredamento<br>  la mia x esempio e celeste e arredamente e blu scuro|`|ffssEOn7aa	Com'è questa casa? Che arredamento c'è? In mancanza di maggiori informazioni, ti dico questo: quando ho dovuto pitturare casa mia, che è molto grande, ero pure io confusa e per tagliare la testa al toro ho fatto tutto bianco. Adesso non mi sono pentita per due motivi: il primo è che col bianco è riuscita bene in ogni suo ambiente e tutti i mobili, divani e altro (che sono colorati) ci stanno benissimo; il secondo è che in questo modo ho avuto il tempo di riflettere meglio a posteriori e ora sto pensando di cambiare solo una parete della camera da letto: a passarci un rullo di pittura azzurra ci vorrà poco, e comunque potrò dire di aver fatto una scelta ragionata.

AA11713801	Because I SELL real estate, this is a question I've pondered many times.  I don't believe you should rely on either the $70/sf or $100/sf numbers because builders couldn't make any money (at least in the Charlotte region).  Since I could easily get you a 3-4,000 sq foot home for $3-$400,000 (including the land), that likely makes both answers inplausable.  Of course, you'd also need to subtract OUT the profit since, if you're building it yourself, that number is immaterial.<br>  <br>  Instead, I'd suggest you try to touch base with a building contractor (in your area).  Ideally, a materials (installed) list combined with RECENT cost estimates would give you a better figure.  <br>  <br>  I own several lots that I'd like to build on and that's why this is an important consideration from my perspective, too.  In addition, why should you build when you can buy for less?  That might be the reason why home building has come to a screeching halt, but materials parts and labor have also declined recently.<br>  <br>  Again, remember that important adage:  "all real estate is local".  The numbers I'd supply for Charlotte can't be used in NYC, Redondo Beach, California, or, heaven forbid, Detroit.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the ambiguity, but I think you shouldn't place a lot of trust in a figure that's so tough to estimate.  If it wasn't so tough to estimate, we wouldn't likely be in the depressed housing state we're in right now.|`|24a0e92730d86ca53f9e5467414cb0aaaa	The two variables are trim level and area.  Trim level covers things like whether you get a home depot kitchen or custom cabinets with high end appliances.  The area you build in will have codes that are altered versions of the national code, depending on the local climate.  I once had a client you had bought plans that were designed in Arizona.  He anted to build on top of a hill in central MA.  We had to re-engineer the plans, so the roof would take the snow load of a new england winter.

In this case, you can keep the decorative curtain open at all times and open the other after the shower. If the simple one catches mold or gets dirty, you would just buy another one, because it would be much less expensive.<br>  I saw this idea at a very expensive hotel (about $500-600 per night).<br>  <br>  If you have a very dirty shower, keep the curtain closed to hide it. ;)|`|y9wuSb21aa	I always close mine.

When that's installed, you don't even know it's there.<br>  <br>  And, yes, curtains are also a good idea.<br>  |`|D4BVISmCaa	Closing the curtains is advisable, they should lock air behind them, especially at the floor because cold air rushes down. Heavy curtains are not necessary. It will help a little but they tend to be expensive. Think about tin blinds or shades right before the glass, they can be used in summer also. Note that not every model blind closes completely. I had a negative advise about placing a small extra window over an opening window but it gave me no problem. There is a foil on the market to apply on the windows frame, it will keep draft out. Some draft however is required for fresh air. After attaching this foil it is tightened with a hairdryer but it remains visible. Could be used at the back of the house. Ask the owner to invest in the building, isolation glass is cheaper then it was before and plastic frames do not need any care. If not, drink warm drinks and wear warm clothes. I have a granite stone and a bag with cherry stones to warm up in the microwave and keep under my clothes. Central heating can better be installed before the curtains, not behind it. It can not keep up with the thermostat in winter, so a additional silent electric fan heater is advisable. You will need it to point at yourself sometimes, to help heating the sleeping room and to prevent the house from freezing when away. You should really try hard to keep the air from getting moist. This air is much harder to heat and moist condenses at the windows and in other parts of the house requiring you to heat more.|`|Nw2rQY8Taa	Stay cool in summer and warm in winter with insulating cellular, honeycomb shades.

rsc0risnaa	A lot of materials are good for mulching. Straw works well and makes the garden look nice and neat. Also when they decompose  they add organic matter to the garden. Do not use hay, which contain a lot of grass seeds. I have also used cardboard, Kraft paper and bark mulch. You can also use partly decomposed grass clippings if you don't apply harmful chemicals to your lawn. Let the green clipping turn brown and then apply at the base of the beans, eggplants or pepper plants, they work fine too.

Around $15-20 a bale.|`|lBw50ySpaa	Here in Georgia, USA, we use pine bark or pine straw.  My favorite trick though is to put newspaper down 2 pages thick first.  Then mulch over.  It will keep virtually all the weeds out, and you can just till it into the soil next year.  Farmers have been doing it for years, and now Auburn University in Alabama has been testing it for 10 years, and verifies it as a sound practice.<br>  If you use straw, it may blow up a little, so put a handful of soil on top to weight it down until you get it wet.
98tUW1Y7aa	You need the height of the window plus 6 inches for hems. Measure from just above the actual window to where you want them to end, then add 6 inches. Then across the window, either twice the width or 2 and a half the width, depending on how full you need them. These measurements are for material if you intend to make your curtains. If using ready mades, you need them. Height, just above your window to where you want them to hang to. Width both curtains together to measure twice the width or 2 and half depending on how full you want them. I hope this helps.

5HTyP1oaaa	The reason for locating roofing nails just below the tar strip is for added wind resistance. While you may not have placed your nail pattern perfectly in the first 5 bundles, I wouldn't renail them. The shingle damage you may cause by prying the tabs up enough to renail would cancel out any benefit you'd gain. (And that's a lot of extra work!) Rather, you could go back over that area in a couple weeks and check to be sure all the tabs are sealed down. Any that are not can be hand sealed with a few tubes of roofing mastic. That will make it less likely that you'll have any wind caused blow off damage and won't take much time. Just be sure you don't get any mastic on top of the shingles. Just a dab under any shingle tabs that aren't sealed and push it down and you should be fine.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	In order to re-nail the 5 bundles worth of shingles you would have to remove them first, (or at least most of them) this would weaken the shingle far more than leaving them in place and re-nailing them.   If the nail still goes thru the top shingle and the one below it you would gain very little.  I have put down many roofs (that have not blown away yet - some are going on ten years) and a lot of them have nails above the "nailing strip".  However I tend to "storm nail" my shingles, that is I use 6 nails per shingle as opposed to the minimum of 4 that is usually recommended.<br>  <br>  I would leave them where they lay and just go on from where you are now.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about it just lift the edges of the shingles on the edges of the roof and add a nail or two,  a little extra "black Jack" to help tab the down can't hurt either.|`|K7M8aWMKaa	If you nail the shingles as recommended, you are putting the nail through both the shingle you are applying and the one under it also.  That's correct nailing.  If it is too high on the shingle, you are missing the shingle under it.  Not life or death.  I sure wouldn't go back!|`|0QpCwRiMaa	as long as the one shingle above it is covering all the nail heads you should be fine, read the instrutions first.<br>  The bundle is heavy enough you would want to make sure before you go about doing the labour to have dome some theory work.

However, lets say it's 100% cotton, or some other washable fabric.  spray the item either with shout it out, dawn dish washing liquid which is great for getting out red food stains, or the dollar general stores have a neat item for $1.00 called Lightening.  rub gently into the fabric.

f7zLs18caa	swiss chard, lettuce, broccoli, carrots, onions, arugula, sorrell, green beans, chives, sunflowers (sunflower seeds).  You can try different types of tomatoes for different flavors and sizes.  Swiss chard, lettuce and broccoli are cold crops.  Swiss chard is nice if you like the taste because you can also plant it in the winter...my grandmother says that she used to harvest it from under the snow.<br>  <br>  You can also grow other melons, such as muskmelon (canteloupe).  To get the watermelons to be larger, try having just one flower (fruit) per plant (seed).  That way, the plant won't have to focus its attention on growing lots of fruits.  Also try fertilizer.<br>  <br>  For herbs you can grow lavendar, rosemary, basil, thyme, pretty much anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why no fruit trees?  You could buy smaller sized tropical fruit trees like orange and lemon trees that you can put outside in the summer and keep indoors the rest of the time.  They also have self pollinating fruit trees now for apples, peaches, etc, so you only need one.  You can buy them at a garden center when they are mature (so theyll produce fruit that year).|`|wycisonaaa	I think the most efficient and reliable growing plants to grow would be tomatoes, peppers, snow peas, amd possibly blueberries.

ww12lItvaa	If you don't smell it when off and you didn't say which burner you are using when this happens, but most likely it is a slight gas leak in the line that feeds a burner. Yes, you will get a slight odor of gas when it lights but that should go away as it is used.  <br>  <br>  The gas goes to the valve that shuts it off. Then there is a 1/4 inch line that goes from the valve to the burner. It is most likely that a fitting on either end of that line is loose and has a very slight leak. <br>  <br>  You can smell the smallest of leaks so it is likely not a concern unless it is very strong. But should be addressed. <br>  <br>  Sorry but for many of them it is not real easy to get to the manifold under the top. You usually have to remove all the burners and remove the screws for the top just above the oven door on a range. <br>  <br>  I would start by cooking with different burners to see which one(s) is giving off the odor as we tend to use a particular burner out of habit.<br>  <br>  Also make sure the burners themselves are very clean and all the openings are clean and clear so it is not the burner itself releasing unburnt fuel.

5dd5103261c8c0347c5369577eccb01baa	De echo hay piiscinas de otros colores que no sean celestes , yo he visto en diversos lugares revestidas en color marfil y en beige y gris claro y verde muy claro. Las mas usadas son las celestes porque hace que el agua parezca mas cristalina, de hecho las que no son revestidas son pintadas con una pintura especial para piscinas que solamente se fabrica en tonos celeste y celeste azulado. O sea que quien desee pintar la piscina solo puede hacerlo en esos colores y quien decide revestirla puede hacerlo en otros colores pero hay que tener en cuenta que demandara mayor cuidado ya que se nota mas toda la suciedad que pueda tener el agua. Esto se debe a que si bien el agua es transparente absorve mas algunas radiaciones del espectro que otras (sabemos que la luz blanca esta formada por diferentes radiaciones con distintos colores -longitud de onda- que van desde el infrarrojo al ultravioleta) las longitudes de onda menos absorvidas por el agua son las que se acercan al ultravioleta,o sea dentro de las visibles por el ojo humano serian los celestes cianes y azules, entonces al ser las paredes y fondo de la piscina en ese color (como el agua no interfiere en la conductividad de esa longitud de onda) podes apreciar que los bordes que quedan fuera del agua practicamente no van a tener diferencia de color con respecto a las partes que esten bajo el agua - entonces ahi es donde el agua parece mas transparente -si es de color blanco éste se veria interferido por las particulas del agua y si bien se la veria transparente seria con un ligero color rojizo marron, lo cual daria un aspecto de suciedad. Si por el contrario, se pintara de color negro (lo cual dependiendo de la decoracion - hasta podria quedar exotico -) el problema seria si la piscina esta ubicada en el exterior, el color negro absorve toas las radiaciones de la luz solar y elevaria la temperatura del agua y tambien se notarian mucho mas los reflejos sobre la superficie del agua, casi como un espejo, dificultando ver si hay algun objeto en el fondo, seria un efecto similar al que si colocas un papel negro detras de un vidrio transparente, comprovaras que éste refleja mas que si tuviera un papel blanco, y al igual que en las piscinas , si colocas un papel celeste veras que se equilibran los reflejos y el vidrio parece mas transparente.

bxlYleZkaa	There is a small tank, about the size of a teacup in which the water is heated by elements and a thermostat fixed to the outside of this tank controls the power to those elements. The whirring noise you hear is the microswitches cutting in and out as they try to keep the heat at the temperature you have set. I would suggest the thermostat has failed and that, usually means the unit itself is not worth repairing, however if you are a tenant in the flat then a replacement is probably your landlords responsibility.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	As a temporary fix look to see if your shower has a 'summer' or half power setting.|`|576ffa89e847ec1c8ed4cd65ee6f6dbcaa	It sounds like this is an electric shower as opposed to a power shower.

I assume it’s quite old so probably not worth trying to fix.|`|NMK7Z66Yaa	The valve in your shower is what calls for the hot or cold water, from what it sounds like to me is that the mixer valve in your shower needs repair.

jzbG6ZjQaa	1st of all relax!  Not all seeds end up germinating.  As a general rule, tomatoes can take between 7-14 days to germinate and peppers,between 10-21 days.  Sometimes you may sow your seeds too deep in the soil,making germination even longer to expose themselves above the soil.  In that case, sometimes they wither and die before breaking the surface.  Other times the soil that you use is not light & airy enough to allow them to sprout,especially tomatoes, who's sprout is more delicate.  In some instances the seeds are old and or dried out, and no matter what you do, they wont germinate. Don't ever tell a gardener I told you to do this, but if after the allotted time for germination has passed, gently probe the soil and see if they are having a hard time getting through the surface,,,if so,don't pull them, but loosen the soil,even remove some soil above the sprout to make it easier.  Good luck!|`|wKQbNvm9aa	Did you plant them at the correct depth?  The soil needs to be consistently moist and warm.  If it is cool by the windowsill, that will slow them down.  They don't need light until they sprout, so if you have a warmer place, like the top of the refrigerator, that would be fine.  Just make sure the soil stays moist and warm (at least 70 degrees) and they should sprout.  I put the pots under a plastic lid until they sprout.  Give it a few more days.  Good luck.

7ZVybmVWaa	Ummm<br>  I need more info - what exactly r u trying to do?<br>  <br>  CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG----<br>  <br>  The 3 condo units are in one building, and they all share the same front door entrance.<br>  The three door bell buttons are located at a 'common' door for the 3 units.  And you want each button to ring seperatly in a coresponding unit?<br>  <br>  Do you have a seperate transformer for each unit?<br>  A door bell gets wired in series. <br>   <br>  What I mean is - well get a piece of paper, we will draw it out.<br>  <br>  Start at the top left of the paper, write the word - 'transformer'.<br>  A couple of inches down - write the word 'switch' (normally open).<br>  A couple of inches down write the word 'buzzer'.<br>  Draw a line from the transformer to the switch to the buzzer (going straight down the page)<br>  Draw a line from the buzzer heading to the right and up back to the transformer.  Its basically just a circle.<br>  In other word the doorbell would never work unless sombody closed the circuit by pressing the doorbell button ( which is normaly open) was not in place.  The switch just closes the circuit to allow the buzzer (chime or whatever) to work.<br>  <br>  If you are using three buttons you will need to have 3 seperate hots.<br>  Apprently you have just one hot (the red wire), so I will assume that you have just one transformer.<br>  Take the one hot, and get 3 short pieces of wire. Pigtail these wires together - that is to say - connect all 4 wiers togehter.  Attach one of the 3 pigtailed hots to each button.<br>  The second wire (the switched hot) from the each doorbell button need to go to one buzzer in each unit. <br>  The first wire on the buzzer is the switched hot (from a door bell button). <br>  The second wire on the buzzer needs to go back to the transformer.  If you have only 1 transformer then there will be three wires (1 from each buzzer) returning to the transformer.  Pigtail all of the three wires together and attach to the transformer.<br>  Thats it - ur done.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	? What?why, doesn't each unit not have it's own door-bell system?You may need to pigtail wires for the power to each unit.|`|52e654eabf1bcef75fcacc45bc4305a0aa	I think the easiest is way would be to wire each one separately.<br>   I mean run a 2 wire  doorbell wire from the button to the chime in unit A.<br>  You do the same thing for units B and C<br>  From the transformer in unit A you run a 2 wire up to the chime.At the chime you have 2  2-wires hook up the red form the transformer to the middle screw on the chime.  Hook up the red from the button to either screw marked front or back. Now hook up your 2 remaining wires together.<br>  Do this for each unit and you should be set to go.|`|8WP9Gu1saa	As I understand it, you need to trigger three separate door bells from a common door gate with separate switches corresponding to each unit. The first thing to do is to get a common line for the three doorbells, splice it together and call it line 1 intended for the power line or one side of the socket or the plug which ever is convenient for you to install.  Color code the 3 wires coming out of the unconnected side of the bells. Place thiis 3 colored wires plus another wire that you will call line 2 or that which is to be connected to the plug or the power source in the opposite side of the socket, inside a wire mold that runs up to the gate. On your push button switch panel at the gate, wire one side of the switches to the "line 2", while connecting the color coded wires to the opposite end of the individual switches, keeping in mind the code for each appartment unit.. Plug line 1 and line 2 to the outlet and your bells are ready to use, one at a time or all together. Be sure that you are using the AC (110 or 220 VAC) kind of buzzer or bell in this type of wiring.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I had trouble following your explanation.<br>  All I can tell you is that lighted buttons are no different than non-lighted ones,<br>  and no more difficult to install.|`|AA10097817	I think I'd try a wireless door bell.

The circuit is continuous, but if you press the switch (now it open) and the buzzer stops?????<br>  Do all of the buttons do this?  Is this a new inststallion, or were they working fine before, but now you have a problem with just the 1st button?  If it is a recent problem and all was working fine before, then your 1st button has failed - just replace it.|`|iqMPvr7Taa	If the new buttons are lighted buttons when you hook them up you are completing the circuit.

She sprinkles powdered bleach (we use ajax) on the wet surface, then takes damp rags and lays them over the bleach.  It is sort of pasty and then you leave it like that for the afternoon, or as long as you can.  Make sure you open a window, or turn the fan on- but the tub is always super clean after one of these treatments!|`|a5ceb15218a9b94083e0125311d2254aaa	yeah i would go tto lowes or sherwin williams and pick up a bathtub a kit to redo your bathtub it's only about 40 dollars and is fairly easy to do and your tub looks brand new afterwards

9LnG9Nj1aa	take the p-trap off the sink, the little "U" shaped pipe under the cabinet.  Chances are any wax that did make it down the drain solidified when it hit the water in the trap.|`|vnAdsquxaa	You can get a bottle of sulfuric acid to solve the problem.  But if you go this route, make sure there is no standing water in the sink and use VERY LITTLE in the drain.  Sulfuric acid is some nasty stuff so make sure you use extreme caution and read and follow all directions carefully.  When the drain is open, flush well with cold water.  And another drawback is it smells like rotten eggs, so open your windows before you start.
9LnG9Nj1aa	that's just the check valve closing after the pump kicks off.  The pumps stops and so does the water flow, the water left in the pipe will drop back towards the pump and cause this to happen.  It is not faulty, I'd suggest strapping the piping to limit how much it can wobble/wiggle/move around.  This should take care of the banging or at least most of it.|`|c93687d4de5b8ed908d264c10fe4e506aa	If it shakes that usually means there is some sort of balance problem. It could also be cavitating (turning a liquid to a vapor due to pressure and not heat). You could also have a flow back problem where the liquid forces back down the pipe.

If they dig again, they get poo on the paws and have to clean it off with their mouth.
alIO8ic0aa	Try soaking in water with Oxy Clean and mild detergent. May take a couple days. I find that works on many items and even on stains that have been dried in.|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	The title question really caught my eye, never heard of Florida stain before and it's my home state.<br>  <br>  Since it's a vintage dress and there's no telling what kind of dyes or manufacturing additives were used, it's probably best to dry-clean the dress.  If you hate dry-cleaners (I do), you could use dryel and dry-clean at home.  <br>  <br>  If the fabric looks pretty durable, hand washing and air-drying would probably work.  Orange juice is easy to wash out.
AA11305474	Good luck.  For the ones that are bound with rivets, it is next to impossible to remove them without really destroying the edge of the pages which you don't see in the binding.  So by knifing them out you are using the most efficient means by which you can remove the pages with the least damage.  I've been in the interior design business for 30 years and have tried just about every way to remove the pages for re-use and have recently found a new gizmo that works well.  It probably has a name but it is used to cut wrapping paper or open up those plastic sealed electronics, the blade is between two V shaped plastic pieces, it has a nice long handle and whips through the pages with ease.  Best yet, it costs like $1.99.  I got mine at Big Lots near the school/office supplies but have seen them at Michaels and WalMart.  PS the recyclers still will take the cover and binding, so don't put them in the regular trash.

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	krystal;<br>  <br>  for grapes:  in early spring about 3 weeks prior to last frost, set out year-old vines after trrimming their roots to 6 inches (this forces growth of feeder roots).  Pace them as deep in the soil as they grew in the nursery, spreading the roots in all directions.  Cut top growth back to two buds.<br>  <br>  For strawberries: In most parts of the country they are planted in early spring, about 3 to 4 weeks before the last exected frost.  Where winters are mild, you can plant them in early summer, autumn and winter.  Throughly loosen the soil and if it has organic matter you should need no fertilizer.  Before planting the roost should be kept moist and if from a nursery are probably year-old plants.  Anyway, trim the roost to 6 inches for easier planting.  Whe setting the plants, it's essential to have the base of the crown at soil level, roots gently fanned out and the soil firmed around them.  Roots must be completely buried.<br>  <br>  Blueberry:  plant them in the autumn if your winter is mild, otherwise, in early spring.  Prune transplants down to 3 or 4 of their strongest shoots and prune off the plump fruit buds.  Dig holes 18" deep and as wide.  Blend soil with organic matter before back-filling and planting.  Set plants 4 to 6 feet aprat.  Put down a thickmulch around each plant to help shallow roots to retain moisture.  For purchasing blueberry plants one should buy 2 or 3 year-old plants that are 12 to 16 inches high.  To allow essential cross-pollination, choose two or three different varieties to raise together.  (Although today, some are certified as not requiring cross-pollination).<br>  Rspberry:  avoid planting where you have previously grown tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or eggplant - they may have tainted the soil with a potentially harmful fungus.  Plant in early spring.  Plant red and yellow raspberries in rows; purple and black raspberries should be planted 2 to 3 ft apart and devlop into "clumps." Set all raspberries 1 to 2 inches deeper in soil than they were in the container.  Cut back all newly planted canes to 5 or 6 inches above the ground.  <br>  <br>  Good luck in your garden|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You should have received instructions on when to plant with the plants. Because they are vulnerable to cold, I would wait until after your frost date to plant them.|`|fCS6oecCaa	I would wait a while longer,,,, remember blue berry plants NEED acidity soil, or they WILL NOT produce any berry's.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	If these plants have leaves, no wait until you are past your last frost.  Oh, the strawberries might be able to go in if you completely cover them with a mulch.......straw.......for example so the frost can't kiss the leaves.  <br>  <br>  If the plants are without leaves.........probably you can put them out.  If you see leaves popping out before the last frost, be prepared to completely cover the plants.  New foliage is especially frost sensitive.

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Cleaning out the aerator may increase pressure.  Also, check underneath the counter where the shut-off valve is located(usually).  It may not be turned fully to the on position - that may increase the pressure. Short of that, check to see if your plumbing has a leak.  finally, I think you can find a booster that will increase water-pressure for the entire house, if needed.  It's added where the source of your plumbing enters your house.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|B4O3f8w6aa	If it is only the one sink with bad pressure, remove the aerator on the end of the spout and replace or clean it out.|`|IqlDYwH6aa	You could install a faucet with a smaller diameter outlet, which would increase pressure.<br>  <br>  If the pressure seems worse with hot water, check your hot water heater.
