20090308094732AAQqXXB	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Would community polygynandry (one can have sex with anyone) be a solution for sexual morality?  I come out of?	Would community polygynandry (one can have sex with anyone) be a solution for sexual morality?      I come out of a Puritan tradition that said essentially "sex is bad". That was a bit primitive. But indeed even now I see the great damage done to the lives of young people,especially by that blind wild sexual urge. It is very harmful to the status of women, but indeed it also ruins the character of men.      But then i wondered, what is the origin of sexual puritanism? And I realized perhaps it was not rational. Sex lust does a lot of damage to social relations. A culture of pleasure in the end leads to more pain. But there is nothing inherently wrong with the physical act of sex, except STDS, and perhaps pain to females.      So the solution seems to be, to allow people to enjoy the physical pleasures of sex, without the negative cultural and social relations that follow. Community polygynandry in which any man can have sex with any woman, and any woman could have sex with any man seems to be the solution. So it could be a voluntary organization in which men and women would have the opportunity to have sexual relations with men and women, equal and more attractive than them, but in turn have to copulate with those less attractive.      If sex was de-mystified in this way, as simply a way to enjoy physcial stimulation, without the ugly cultural side effects, I think marginal utility could be maximized.      What are your thoughts and objections?

20090306231926AAke5jf	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Find the implicite differentiation of -y^5/2 = -x?	Find the implicite differentiation of -y^5/2 = -x      I've done this a couple of different ways and keep coming to the same answer:   y' = 2/5y^4      but my software is giving me this:   y' = 5y^4/2      It is not always right, though.  So am I doing something wrong or is the software wrong?  Here is my work:      First remove the two from the demoninator (because I don't like the quotient rule)      (2) * -y^5/2 = -x (2)      -y^5 = -2x      Next, get the derivatives of both sides      -5y^4*y' = -2      Divide out -5y^4 to get y' by itself:      (-5y^4y')/(-5y^4) = -2/(-5y^4)      This gives me:      y' = 2/5y^4      I don't see any flaws in my math here.  Is the software wrong?

You also know the following   probabilities (V=Vancouver, H=Hong Kong): if yesterday it rained in V and H, today it   will rain in V with probability 1 and in H with probability 1/2; if yesterday it rained only   in V, today it will rain in V with probability 1/2 and in H with probability 1/4; if yesterday   it rained only in H, today it will rain in V with probability 1/4 and in H with probability   0; if yesterday it did not rain, today it will rain in V with probability 1/8 and in H with   probability 0.   a) Calculate the transition probability of [Xn]   b) On day 0, V is rainy with probability 1=2, while H is rainy with probability 0: calculate   the probability that, on day 1, V is rainy.

20090307001645AAIjd9o	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What would happen if a particular human being has YY chromosomes? (I know that girls have XX and boys have XY)?	Really, what would happen, I know it's impossible in reality because the females reproductive systems only produces XX chromosomes, so there's got to be an X chromosome existing as part of a person.       BUT, lets say that this is a different unrealistic dimension and a baby was born, or created through some particular matter, with 100% all pure YY Chrosomes, would that be considered as a sex? Would they be more manly? Lol, cus the reason why guys are guys is due to the fact that they have a Y chromosome within' their XY chromosome.      Btw, if this question really can't be answered, then may I pls ask if X chromsomes is more dominant than Y? Cus without X, a baby couldn't possibly be born (Not sure)...But then there are Always 2 X's and 1 Y or X chromosomes among two parents rite? But then the numbers of boys and girls in society is still similar, though the male produces more Y chromosomes then X, but X chromosomes is always more as the female produces 2 X chromosomes...Not one....      AHHHH SO CONFUSING FOR A 14 YEARS OLD YOUNGSTA!!!!
20090307005815AA5VWuN	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Which properties of elements display periodic variation?	I had to draw 3 graphs for chem:   1: first ionisation energy vs. atomic number   2: number of valence electrons vs. atomic number   3: atomic radius vs. atomic number      now i have a set of questions to answer, and i'm a bit puzzled...      I have to say which properties display periodic variation, and which don't.      Am I correct in saying that the atomic radius varies periodically? (as it gets larger down a group, even though it still gets smaller across a period)   And also that the 1st ionisation energy varies periodically?      But that the number of valence electrons DOES NOT vary periodically.            I'm confused!!      Thanks

That seems to be a contradiction on one hand the energy lost by the system is gained by the surroundings but on the other hand not all the energy is available because some gets stuck in the system/reaction...

According to wiki :"Cavitation is defined as the phenomenon of formation of vapour bubbles of a flowing liquid in a region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure".      In a book that I'm reading, it says that :"The cavitation bubbles are swept to a zone of higher pressure where they collapse and erosion of the surface may occur."      Wiki says lower pressure, my book says higher pressure.    Which one is right?

At noon, sunlight travels through the least amount of atmosphere with little scattering of high-frequency light to the surface.      4) Red light is easily scattered through the air since its frequency is the lowest. At noon, sunlight travels through the least amount of atmosphere with little transmission of high-frequency light to the surface.      5) the sun is colder at sunrise and sunset than at noon.

20070619210634AAU7t7u	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Why do I see a blue haze around cigarettes?	I see it in the dark or low light, very similar to the way cameras capture it. If you're unfamilar: take a picture of a lit cigarette, and the cherry will appear pale blue. Or a spot next to it will. I see the cherry itself, but just as bright, there's an opaque pale blue streak behind it if it's in motion or a blue dot if it jerks slightly.      I also see a purple haze around red lights. Sometimes, if the light is very small, the purple takes the form of a figure 8 with pointy ends. Like a lens-flare.      My boyfriend doesn't see these things at all, or only if he squints. My theory is that it's a defect of my poor vision. Like, the lense of my eye is mal-formed or something. I'm not on drugs or anything.  I need glasses but don't wear them - when I do, these things are very hard to spot. I've also noted that without glasses, the halo around lights is much, much larger and appears in seperated rings of color.       So. Is it possible that fuzzy vision can affect my color perception?
