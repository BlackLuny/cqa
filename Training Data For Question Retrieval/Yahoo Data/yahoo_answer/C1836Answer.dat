kwOFstbKaa	Yeah the syntax of your if statement is definitely wrong.  It makes no logical sense.  You are saying something like if the left of car2 is greater than 703... oh and 703 is not 703 after all it is the width of the car???<br>  <br>  lblCar3.Left > 703 = pnlCars.Width.  Read the line out to yourself what that shoudl be doing.  I'm guessing you have a typo and mean something like this:<br>  <br>  lblCar3.Left  > 703 - pnlcars.width<br>  <br>  or this:<br>  lblCar3.Left  > 703 + pnlcars.width<br>  <br>  or you mean:<br>  If(lblCar3.Left > 703 And lblCar3.Left =pnlcars.width)  which is unlikely|`|jOljnsulaa	While it's not the language I usually program in and I may be wrong, I think it's happening because your if statement isn't triggering.<br>  <br>  If I'm reading this right, you need car 3 to be Left > 703 and equal to pnlCars.Width.<br>  <br>  I can only guess that car 3 never is the same as pnlCars.Width<br>  <br>  Can you do an else while you debug?  Put another label on the form and call it lblCheck.<br>  <br>  If you can, do else lblCheck.Caption = lblCar3.Left or whatever you need to get this line to work.
VUSgEl46aa	Courtney,<br>  <br>  First off revenue means gross income. Let's say you're a musician and you are selling CDs of your music at the fair. And let's say that each CD costs you $1, the cover $2, space rental $100, signs and brocures $100, and you are expecting to sell 100 CDs at $10 a piece. Your income/expense spreadsheet would look like this: <br>  <br>  Revenue: $1000 (100 CDs x $10 each)<br>  Cost of Sales: $300 (100 CDs x $1 each, plus 100 covers x $2 each)<br>  Gross Profit: $700 (Revenue minus Cost of Sales)<br>  Expenses: <br>  - Space rental: $100<br>  - Signs & brochures: $100<br>  Total Expenses: $200 <br>  Net Profit: $500 (Gross Profit minus Total Expenses)|`|g62ATenqaa	Say you are running your stall selling items you have made.  You have to know how much you have spent, both in money and in time on making those items, then deduct that amount from the total amount you get by selling them and that is your profit.  So, say you sell 50 items for ￡1.00 each item, that is ￡50 in sales, but assuming it cost you 50p to produce each item, 50p x 50 items is ￡25 so your profit is ￡25.|`|MxculX2Daa	Revenue is money coming in.<br>  <br>  Income minus expenditure is profit. But I guess the expenditure could be broken down into categories like travel, event fees, stock etc.

5RqvVmKaaa	I tried what other people wrote already but that didn't work for me. But I found a way to do it:<br>  For Windows XP I found I had to bring up My Documents - by a left click on Start then a left click on My Documents, then I right clicked on Shared Documents, then I went into Sharing and Security, then there comes up an option of making the Sharing Folder private only to you on that computer. That is where you'd change the setting if you want to do so. <br>  <br>  If you look below all of this you will also come across the subject of Remote Access. It's a very good idea to keep Remote Access / Sharinig turned off - which is the option further below in Network Sharing and Security. That is usually turned off by default but it's worth checking that it is still turned off.<br>  <br>  By the way, by double clicking on the Shared Document folder itself you can see what is in there of course so you can decide whether you want to or need to make it private. <br>  <br>  Very good question by the way.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	are you permanantly deleting or temporary.....|`|LoE4rrhLaa	Turn off Folder Sharing.<br>  Go to Control Panel - Users - Folders - Properties (Not shared)|`|laofAjTAaa	turn off sharing - from my computer go to tools - Folder options - view - and at the bottom untick use simply file sharing|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	Have you tied to turn off sharing on your computer?

Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger) is often used for delivering malicious software such as spyware, viruses, worms and trojans to computer users. The two methods used by hackers to deliver malware over the IM vector are (1) sending a file transfer with a virus-infected file, and (2) delivering a message with socially engineered content including a web address (URL) containing active malicious code. Viruses and worms such as W32.Yalove or Troj/Msnfake-L have been identified as targeting users of Windows Live Messenger over the past few years.<br>  On September 12, 2007, the Windows Live Messenger blog posted an entry that reported of a security vulnerability discovered in versions of Messenger. The vulnerability "could allow remote code execution when a user accepts a webcam or video chat invitation from an attacker. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system." This led to an auto-update being released to all older versions. Versions running on Windows 2000 and below were required to update to a new version of MSN Messenger 7.0, and versions running on Windows XP and above were required to update to Windows Live Messenger 8.1.<br>  So you see Windows Live Messenger is not a safe program.

Ao0ZyjCraa	It seems your LCD panel of the scanner has went bad. Contact your scanner company service.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	You might wanna say what the scanner's model number/and model...|`|K2h6M1xqaa	I don't know what you mean by "scanner screen" (the GUI on the computer?  The glass part where you put paper down?  Is there some kind of display built into the scanner itself?)<br>  <br>  However, here are some general suggestions:<br>  <br>  1. Visit the company website for your scanner and check out the knowledge base.  Or Google using your scanner make and model and "Problems" "Green" etc. to see if other people have experienced the same thing and have written about it.<br>  <br>  2. Update the drivers for your scanner by visiting their website.  If you simply used the disk which came with your scanner, you're almost certainly using an old version of the scan software.  In virtually every case, many problems are discovered and then fixed after a computer product has hit the market.  Just download the latest driver and install it.  This is the most common way that hardware problems are resolved.<br>  <br>  3. If all else fails, call the help line listed in the back of your scanner's instruction manual.  Sometimes this is a hellish experience, and other times you'll get amazing assistance.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

yHI6rfeUaa	The issue is a combination of distance from the wireless access point and your games as well as the materials through which the signal must pass.<br>  <br>  Wireless signals weaken with distance.  These can sometimes be remedied by a stronger signal or stronger antenna but this is usually marginal increase.  <br>  <br>  Wireless signals weaken to a much more dramatic degree if they have to pass through dense building materials which include masonry, metals (like ducts, metal plaster lath, silver back mirror, dense plaster, etc.) and the like.  Signal boosters don't help here.<br>  <br>  You will do yourself a lot more good and more likely resolve the issue (assuming that the issue is in fact wireless signal weakness) by running a hard wired line from router to the room where your  games are located and installing a wireless access point there.  In fact if you hard wire directly and avoid wireless altogether you are better off.  <br>  <br>  If your wireless is not tightly secured hackers are also reducing available bandwidth which further complicates the issue.  Be sure to tightly secure your wireless.

RAM is where the running programs run in active space, instead of a hard drive.  It is fast access memory, running at 800-1000-mhz, where a hard drive runs at about maybe 100-400 mhz depending upong the type.  More RAM can't hurt but if your running Vista it should be a safe amount to have.  As you open & close your programs this amount will never change but the amount available will change.

Your hard drive is where you store your pictures, your music, your videos, etc. It's usually about 200GB in size (in today's laptops anyway, though it's different for every computer). How much RAM you use up has nothing to do with how much space you use in your hard drive.<br>  <br>  RAM is basically the messenger in your computer. When you try and access something on your hard drive (music, movies, pictures, whatever), it can be tiresome to have to wait for your computer to find it on your hard drive every time you want to open it. So, your computer stores it in this middle-ground called RAM. The more RAM, the more it can store stuff it knows you open a lot. This doesn't just apply to stuff you want to look at, but also stuff your computer wants to look at (like program files and things like that). <br>  <br>  Because all this information is stored in RAM, your computer doesn't have to keep trudging back to the hard drive to look for it again. Think of it like when you take all the ingredients out of the cupboards to make cake. It's awfully convenient to have flour sitting right next to you when you need it, instead of going to grab it (even if it's only four feet away).<br>  <br>  This means that the more RAM you have, the more you can multitask. It doesn't take as long to grab information for you, so it runs faster and smoother, which means you can pile on extra programs!<br>  <br>  Right now, to run Windows Vista it's advised you have about 2GB of RAM (because Vista has pretty graphics, which makes your computer run a lot of stuff at the same time to make your desktop sparkle), but I think 1GB of RAM - as long as you're not running into any problems - is just fine.<br>  <br>  I personally have 512MB of ram, which is about half of what you have. I have an ooold computer. ;)|`|DYqDORQFaa	it's good <br>  it will speed up your computer<br>  You can run lots of heavy software ,games <br>  and run lots of programs at once<br>

Then you NEED a start-up disc ( the disc that came with the printer) once you have that in go to My Computer click Dvd Drive it should say something like that depending on what kind of format you have after that click the Dvd Drive and install the printer. If for some reason you have a problem go to Microsoft Word and go to print click on Install printer or find printer I've never really had to do that so your sorta on your own there but Good Luck.

Find a picture online that you really like. Right-click it, and choose "Save as Desktop Background." <br>  Alternatively, you could also save the picture to your My Pictures, then right-click on your desktop, choose Properties, click on the Desktop tab, click Browse, and select the picture you want to use. If you use this method, you can choose to set your background to stretch, be centered, tile, and more.<br>  Email me if you need help with anything I just said. :)|`|c9464b3b0ee74f0dd21d45e833f715e3aa	Here's my favorite place for wallpapers, it's the ubuntu forums:<br>  <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/g/index.php?c=2" rel="nofollow">http://ubuntuforums.org/g/index.php?c=2</a><br>  On that main page you'll see a wallpaper of angelina jolie that I posted a few days ago.

sikH1bLOaa	For this budget you dont have much variety. Even otherwise the specifications wont be that good. It also depends on for what purpose you need it. My personal feeling is get a laptop online from either HP or Dell from their US website. You can get laptops under even $700 and they have really really good specs. But only pre-requisite is that yuo need to have some relation in the US so that they could bring it over when they come here. This is a very good option which you could give a try instead of getting a sad specs laptop in India

Then once everything is perfect, you will announce the site or the domain to the world... sounds like a good plan to me.<br>  <br>  All you need now is a good and reliable host to upload all your stuff and be ready for the big launch. If you are having problem choosing a good web hosting at low price, I suggest you do the following:<br>  <br>     1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury, hostingsthatsuck.com or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.<br>  <br>     2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a “X sucks” search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.<br>  <br>     3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.<br>  <br>  You can start with Justhost, Fatcow and Webfaction. They are some of the best with cheapest price around. With Webfaction, you can pay month by month too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mwmJJz5Uaa	If you want personalized, reliable and quick advice, you should check out ProCompare.com (<a href="http://procompare.com/top/Web-hosting)." rel="nofollow">http://procompare.com/top/Web-hosting).</a> They have a recommendation engine that ranks web hosting services based on ratings and reviews from a community of trusted IT professionals.

Keep tapping it once or twice a second and sfter a few seconds you will see a white text menu on a black screen.<br>  <br>  From that menu select "VGA mode".<br>  Your pc will now start with very basic screen resolution that your monitor will be able to display.

Reboot and as soon as the computer restarts, start pushing f8. You will get a screen that asks how you want to boot. Select safe mode with nothing else behind it. You will now boot up into windows. From there go into your display settings and return the resolution to what is was or if you don't know go to the lowest setting and apply the changes. Now restart the computer and you should get video to display on the monitor. If the icons look too big then change the resolution one higher. If they are too small then turn the resolution down on notch. Then tell your brother not to mess with that sort of stuff.|`|1LsBPok8aa	I don't know what to do if you have any other OS other than Vista.

2LbTrlQnaa	SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which one or more recipients of a message are specified (and in most cases verified to exist) along with the message text and possibly other encoded objects. The message is then transferred to a remote server using a series of queries and responses between the client and server. Either an end-user's e-mail client, a.k.a. MUA (Mail User Agent), or a relaying server's MTA (Mail Transport Agents) can act as an SMTP client.<br>  <br>  An e-mail client knows the outgoing mail SMTP server from its configuration. A relaying server typically determines which SMTP server to connect to by looking up the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS record for each recipient's domain name. Conformant MTAs (not all) fall back to a simple A record in the case of no MX (relaying servers can also be configured to use a smart host). The SMTP client initiates a TCP connection to server's port 25 (unless overridden by configuration). It is quite easy to test an SMTP server using the netcat program (see below).<br>  <br>  SMTP is a "push" protocol that cannot "pull" messages from a remote server on demand. To retrieve messages only on demand, which is the most common requirement on a single-user computer, a mail client must use POP3 or IMAP. Another SMTP server can trigger a delivery in SMTP using ETRN. It is possible to receive mail by running an SMTP server. POP3 became popular when single-user computers connected to the Internet only intermittently; SMTP is more suitable for a machine permanently connected to the Internet.<br>  <br>  A simple aid to memory is "Send Mail To People."<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] History<br>  Various forms of one-to-one electronic messaging were used in the 1960s. People communicated with one another using systems developed for a particular mainframe computer. As more computers began to be interconnected with others, especially in the US Government's ARPANET, standards were developed to allow users using different systems to be able to e-mail one another. SMTP grew out of these standards developed during the 1970s.<br>  <br>  SMTP can trace its roots to the Mail Box Protocol (ca. 1971), FTP Mail (ca. 1973),[1] and Mail Protocol.[2] The work continued throughout the 1970s, until the ARPANET converted into the modern Internet around 1980. Jon Postel then proposed a Mail Transfer Protocol in 1980 that began to remove the mail's reliance on FTP.[3] SMTP was published as RFC 821 in August 1982, also by Postel.<br>  <br>  The SMTP standard was developed around the same time as Usenet, a one-to-many communication network with some similarities.<br>  <br>  SMTP became widely used in the early 1980s. At the time, it was a complement to UUCP (Unix to Unix CoPy) mail, which was better suited to handle e-mail transfers between machines that were intermittently connected. SMTP, on the other hand, works best when both the sending and receiving machines are connected to the network all the time. Both use a store and forward mechanism and are examples of push technology. Though Usenet's newsgroups are still propagated with UUCP between servers[4], UUCP mail has virtually disappeared[5] along with the "bang paths" it used as message routing headers.<br>  <br>  The article about sender rewriting contains technical background info about the early SMTP history and source routing before RFC 1123.<br>  <br>  Sendmail was one of the first (if not the first) mail transfer agents to implement SMTP. Some other popular SMTP server programs include Postfix, qmail, Novell GroupWise, Exim, Novell NetMail, Microsoft Exchange Server, Sun Java System Messaging Server and the Sobig worm. As of 2001 there were at least 50 programs that implemented SMTP either as clients (senders of messages) or as servers (receivers of messages).<br>  <br>  Message Submission (RFC 2476) and SMTP-AUTH (RFC 2554) were introduced in 1998 and 1999, both describing new trends in e-mail delivery. Originally, SMTP servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the organization from the outside, and relaying messages from the organization to the outside. But as time went on, SMTP servers (Mail transfer agents), in practice, were expanding their roles to become Mail submission agents for Mail user agents, some of which were now relaying mail from the outside of an organization. (e.g. A company executive wishes to send e-mail while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) This issue, a consequence of the rapid expansion and popularity of the World Wide Web, meant that the SMTP protocol had to include specific rules and methods for relaying mail and authenticating users to prevent abuses such as unsolicited e-mail (spam) relaying.<br>  <br>  As this protocol started out purely ASCII text-based, it did not deal well with binary files. Standards such as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. MTAs developed after Sendmail also tended to be implemented 8-bit-clean, so that the alternate "just send eight" strategy could be used to t|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	smtp.mail.yahoo.com <br>  (use port 25, unless it's SSL, then it's port 445 I think)
z7Tz8npYaa	Floppy drives are obsolete, and furthermore, truly inefficient. Of course there won't be a floppy drive for it.
UV8bN0Giaa	You will NOT find a built-in Floppy Disk Drive on any newly manufactured Desktop PC or Notebook PC bec they are obsolete and the USB thumb drive has long since replaced the 3 1/2" floppy disk.  If you don't like the USB thumb drive then the next best thing besides the $20 external floppy drive with USB cable mentioned above is to purchase and use CD-RW disks (note these are not the typical CDRs) bec these can both read & write several times just like the older obsolete floppy drives.    Hope the Above Info Helps!|`|AA11815137	No, it doesn't come with a floppy disc drive.    Your computer is one of Dell's slinkier models, compact, slim, but nice too with many features.

This way you simply plug your floppy disc drive into any of your USB ports and you can use your floppy discs.

g7M1DxFCaa	I find that when I use this software the network connection will not work unless my real computer's network card is connected to another device.  If it's not connected to anything then the computer doesn't consider the network to exist. (A network cable is unplugged, etc)    EDIT:  Unless of course, 'Lion of Judah' that the whole reason that she's set up Win98 on a virtual PC is to run software that won't work with XP.  Compatability mode in XP doesn't work half the time, just like with Vista.  Maybe she want's to be able to use MSDOS based software.  I mean this nicely though, we're both trying to help here.    EDIT: Windows 98 doesn't have CD burning software built in so far as I know, you may have to find drivers and/or additional software to use the writer.  You could always transfer your data through your network when you get it working to the real computer or drag 'n' drop it onto your real desktop, then burn it to CD that way.  It's worth getting it working because Virtual machines are really good.  I used one for a while for browsing because even if it got irrevocably damaged by viruses I could just delete the whole machine and create another, leaving my real computer uninfected.    EDIT:  For the internet on the virtual machines to work you need to configure your computer for internet connection sharing.  Type 'network setup wizard' into 'Help and Support' on your start menu.  Click the link it offers and run the wizard, choosing the options as if the virtual machines were real machines connected by LAN cables.  If you're using Vista then right click the icon in the tasktray for the network, choose 'network and sharing centre'.  Choose 'Manage network connections' from the list of tasks on the left.  Right click on the connection that connects to the internet, not to other machines and select 'status'. Click the 'Properties' button at the bottom of the 'general' tab.  In the new page that opened pick the 'sharing' tab on the right.  Tick the top box, 'Allow other network users to connect....", then click ok, then close the status page too.  It might tell you that you have to disconnect then reconnect before the changes will happen.  You may have problems doing this if you connect through a router because both will want the IP address 192.168.0.1.  You can do it this way or with the wizard, whichever you find easiest.  You may have to run the wizard in your virtual pc and set it to connect through LAN/another computer on the network.    EDIT: Sun Microsystems Virtualbox is better than Microsoft Virtual PC and it emulates a better machine and can handle Windows or Linux.  Strange hey that the Microsoft one doesn't work with Linux?  http://www.virtualbox.org/|`|jsM8F4bLaa	It's better to just upgrade to Windows XP, you'll have no more problems. ^_^    edit: Windows XP also has compatability mode, which allows you to run software that was made for 95, 98, and ME. ^_^
5304f7297db6262e08324915f73ee6c9aa	You can edit a listing on ebay, but there are some stipulations.  For instance, if bidding has already begun on your item(s) you can't change the pricing or bidding structure.      Having sold certain things on ebay, I've found that usually when I've set a reserve, the bidding usually stops once it has been reached.  So it's not necessarily bad not to have a reserve.    Hope that helps.    PS.   Setting the reserve is set when you want to set the starting bid.|`|kbJt4065aa	You have to add the option. If your item doesn't have bids, go ahead and click "revise listing". The set reserve section is right in the selling format section. If you don't see "Reserve Price" right next to starting price, then at the top of the box that says "selling format" click the "add/remove options" link. That should open a box that will let you select the option to include a "Reserve Price". Once it's within 24 hours of the end of the auction, you can't add one.  http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/reserve....

2LHgmq97aa	Security is not what you would expect on the Mac... Also, it is probably a PowerPC architecture since it's old... G  like G3, G4, or G5... New versions of OS X will not work on it    You pay more for less Mac hardware than a PC...  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3)  Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Avant Window Navigator.Cairo Dock, http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is FASTERr/MORE SECURE to surf on the internet  5) Some Windows programs work with Wnehq/Crossover (also avail on Mac, but why pay $$$)    Instructions how to download, burn and boot  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...  Dual Boot Instructions http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 less than 30 minutes, and within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008 . Linux and Vista were not hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered. Vista was next, and then Linux.  Macs are standardized with Cameras, if your Mac gets hacked, the hacker can turn on your camera with more ease.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (and significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-foru|`|a25f83093cd84b80ae9dbc97c372b4c5aa	Older ones (white iBooks and iMacs) have been horribly slow and unreliable in my experience. New Macs are good but I think they are way overpriced. If you can get one cheap, take it. Not all software for Windows would work on the Mac, though.|`|GYij4N13aa	I don't own one, but whenever I go to Apple store, I always try every single macs lol. But, Macs are preferred by people who like to edit movies, photos, etc. If you use Photoshop or other graphics programs, then Mac is for you. If you love to play PC Games, you will HATE Mac because most games are made for PCs. One thing good on Macs is you can install a thing called "Bootcamp" in which you can use Windows AND Mac in the same computer. You can't do that in PC. If you get it cheap, then get it. If you're buying new one, then stick with PC.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If it's one of the newer ones (Intel), you can run Linux on it.  My only objection to a Mac is that I can get a better PC for less money, and the hardware is "open source".  The only reason they have "better security" is that not that many people have been writing viruses for them.  Practice stupid computing (as opposed to safe computing) and you'll load a Mac up with viruses just as fast as you'll load a PC with viruses.  (I've been on line for decades with PCs [and on bulletin boards before that, with CP/M], never used any anti-anything programs, and never downloaded a Trojan or virus.)

6y29MTyyaa	Your question doesn't really sound like it needs an answer, as you can block/ignore whoever you want.  For what it's worth, it's only polite to keep an open mind.  To assume a 41-year-old male is automatically a pedophile is, quite frankly, prejudiced.  Despite what you see on TV, here are other possibilities:    1) It could be a father with young daughters who are interested in gymnastics but not allowed (by the father) to have a YouTube account,  2) A 15-year-old male subscriber could be just as dangerous as a 41-year-old, if not more -- or a 15-year-old female for that matter,  3) It could be a gymnastics coach who's finding footage for his class of what to do.  Or what not to do. :)    That said, bear in mind that YouTube, like Y!A, is a PUBLIC forum.  Just like any place in public.  Any given person in a mall or street corner could be a pedophile, and if you post video of yourself on YouTube, ASSUME it WILL be seen by men lusting after 14-year-old girls.  They don't need to be your subscribers to watch your videos, and there's nothing illegal about watching something someone posted in public.  Just don't give anyone your personal information, and if any of them DO creep you out, don't hesitate to block them.  You are entitled to act according to your instincts.  So, my advice on what to DO is basically the same as everyone else's.  You don't need anyone's permission or even be polite about blocking a subscriber.    Do what you gotta do; I'm just saying living in fear of 41-year-olds is no way to live.  There are pedophiles out there, sure, so it's always wise to be CAREFUL, but don't necessarily jump to conclusions either.  You could wind up treating an honest 41-year-old like crap and get assaulted by a 15-year-old on a date.|`|Lg02QqMDaa	yeah haha i would block them lol

First make sure it is showing up in the boot window or the bios settings. Usually you can get there by pressing F2 or the Delete key while the computer is first starting to boot. Before it tries to load the OS. Make sure you see the hard drive listed there with your optical drive. That means the hardware is working.     While you're in the bios settings, make sure your boot order is set to boot from the CD/DVD drive first and then the C: drive.    Next, you need to format the drive. You will need to put your Windows OS original disc in the computer and follow the prompts to format the drive and then install  Windows.    If your hard drive is not showing up in the bios settings, you may need to check your connections. If this is a desktop computer, make sure, that it is connected correctly to the motherboard, you have power to the drive, and that the jumper on the back near the other connections is set to Master. There should be a diagram for that on the drive. If it still doesn't work, you may need to have a computer technician take a look at it.     Are you sure your other drive failed? Maybe there is another problem. That's all the help I can give without more info.

The distortion is due to the fact that the output is at a much higher level than the input you're using can handle.  (Try turning the volume on the PC almost all the way down.)    For TV, you'd need an adapter from the 1/8" plug to an RCA plug (or a cable with a 1/8" plug on 1 end and an RCA plug on the other.)  Either Red (right) or White (left) would work - you just have to decide on the input you're going to use.  the TV allows you to switch between a few, and there's a pair of jacks for each one.  Again, if that distorts (it depends on the level the jacks expect), turn the volume on the PC down or use an attenuator.|`|YdbpwkFEaa	the phono needs to go in the output of the pc and the input of the amp

When you run out of physical memory, Windows extends your computers memory by writing to this file as well. This is a very short and probably inexact answer, but that′s what the pagefile is roughly about.<br>  <br>  Another question is of course, why your scanner showed a warning for it in the first place. Since it′s basically memory, a virus could probably be stored in it. There are ways to empty the pagefile during shutdown, but I don′t know if there′s an easier and better way then what I think of (changing a registry setting). Others can probably help with that.
BhNP2P8Xaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Grub will easily boot across drives. <br>  <br>  Grub sets up drive identifiers using zero-indexing. So the "root" entry for each partition will look like "(hd0,0)". The first drive is always 0, the second is 1, and so on. <br>  <br>  The second digit represents the number of the partition on the drive, also zero based.<br>  <br>  Now, the partition numbers are where you have to be careful. Sometimes, a partition is numbered differently from it's physical location...this can happen when you modify or change partitions around without using a new partition table. You can use one of the GUI partitioning tools in Linux or the cfdisk tool in a console to see what the order of the partitions is. <br>  <br>  Then, take the partition position number supplied by Linux and subtract one for the Grub partition number.<br>  <br>  So, on drive #2, partition 3 would be (hd1,2).<br>  <br>  The good thing is that you can edit the grub menu on the fly while you reboot to test things out. Just make sure that you edit the correct numbers in permanently after you reboot.<br>  <br>  I think you're almost completely on the dark side.

If you try to put a better card in that computer, it is going to be kind of a waste of money, as the bottle neck between the CPU and the ram is going to be so slow anyways, it will not take advangate of the true power of the expensive cards.|`|Pxkqq8r2aa	for those games you would be better off getting something like an 8800gt. if you shop around you should be able to pick one up for about $90 US<br>  <br>  They are very demanding games and you only have a single core cpu so probably better to think about something more powerful than an 8400 or and 8500 as they are low-end cards that wont really be up to the task. a 4650 or a 9600gt would be borderline on that machine because of the cpu.|`|53adca422c280d605197c5d02cab2b26aa	You might as well take the Nvidia 8500 it should be better then the 8400.<br>  But I doubt if your system will run oblivion.<br>  Please at least try to buy more ram.

UV8bN0Giaa	We have one older son who has graduated from college and 2 younger children in high school.  We own several desktop PCs and Notebook PCs too but personally speaking from experience, as inexpensive as PCs are today, I would still recommend waiting/delaying the purchase if your existing Home PCs can satisfy the entire family's needs, that you would be BETTER OFF waiting until your child(ren) are in the Senior Year on buying a Notebook PC that will take them through college since the technology will change with upgrades and your kid might want another new one in a few years.     For example, my niece who is a HS senior and got accepted to some great colleges has already gone through two IPODS (now has expensive IPOD Touch), MACBOOK     You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|xdlsGvldaa	The mini lap tops do not have built in CD/DVD drives (she will have to use and buy an external CD/DVD drive), you should consider buying her a full featured lap top.

t5sYXwSqaa	There is no easy answer to this question as numerous things can make your computer slow. One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer sped. Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|CvoLYvWzaa	Software wise - There is only 1 program I would recommend "CrapCleaner" Link in the source box,  "CrapCleaner" does the following<br>  <br>  Clears your Cache, History, Cookies, Index.dat, Recycle Bin, Temporary files and Log files, Recycle Bin, Temporary files and Log files, Third-party application temp files and recent file lists (MRUs).<br>  Including: Firefox, Opera, Media Player, eMule, Kazaa, Google Toolbar, Netscape, Office XP, Nero, Adobe Acrobat, WinRAR, WinAce, WinZip and more...<br>  <br>  This program is easy to use and there are many tutorials on how to use it,<br>  <br>  p.s if your computer is still running slow, I would recommend a hardware update.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|LoE4rrhLaa	There is no such free software.

uH5eYdLqaa	Hi,     It's not as easy as that im afraid.     You need to have some sort of software that you will use to put music onto your mp3 player, i.e an iPod uses iTunes.

You then need to download music from mp3 download websites, http://www.mp3obsession.com/ is good for new users as it lists various websites and compares them all so you can pick the best one.     After you have downloaded music from one of these sites, you then add them to the software, i.e iTunes, Winamp etc and they will sync your new mp3s with your mp3 player.    That site also has a guide (http://www.mp3obsession.com/itunes-guide... on how to add mp3s to itunes and windows media player if you need extra help.

ye1tS9a2aa	right click desktop > arrange icons by > click Lock web icons on desktop|`|wLxyrOOkaa	Certain formats of images wont allow windows to make the border around your icons transparent. For example, if your desktop image is saved in .PNG format most operating systems will leave the colored border behind the text of your icons. The color behind the text is dictated by the color you have selected as a default or 'blank' wallpaper. Try opening the image you wish to use as a wallpaper in some sort of photo editing program, MS paint, or anything similar. Save the image as a .JPG or .BMP, by selecting 'Save as...' from the 'File' drop-down menu. Set the newly saved image as your background and it should solve your problem.|`|rSe6BAynaa	Im a comp programmer there is a thing called a "Batch File" u can use to set all settings on desktop to factory. only thing is if u have AV software it will not allow it. the batch overrides all windows and resets desktop to default background. if you want to use this disable AV software and run the batch it will reset it for you (nothing is lost either thats most important)  http://www.savefile.com/files/1993563  here you go!!|`|NrrYG0f6aa	Do you have Windows XP?

fN2xiQL7aa	Windows Movie Maker is very flaky when it comes to videos. If it says you don't have enough space, like the message you got, don't believe it. It has happened to me and I think the actual logical reasoning for the problem is WMM doesn't like the video files you are using even if they are the file type WMM takes.    I would recommend using iMovie by Apple. You can also yahoo or google it for free video editing programs, they're out there, you just need to find them.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	try, disk cleanup > more options tab > delete system restore points...this does take awhile so wait till the ok buttons functions again...the last restore point is untouched|`|7e14b6ac44d82559e551d5acc626b3abaa	As you go through the save process, make sure that you specify a folder on your hard drive for the save location.

I would check the manufacturers website for an Bios Update aswell..
MeeJWmGtaa	NTFS of you only want to use it on XP, Vista, Win2000.  FAT32 if you also want to use it on Macs.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	If you plan to use it only with Windows, go with NTFS.    If you think you may ever share the My Book with a Mac or Linux computer, then go with FAT32.    The only potential problem with FAT32 is that its file size limit is 4 GB. So if you have extremely large files (videos, for example), they won't be storable on a FAT32 drive.    A good compromise might be carving two partitions into the drive. One partition can be NTFS for storing files larger than 4 GB. The other can be FAT32 for exchanging files with non-Windows computers.|`|BavxZqm8aa	ntfs|`|EWnNzdRmaa	FAT 32 IS Best if its ur personal pc coz if u need some other kind of editing lateron  Ntfs will never let u do anythin If u asking due to security(Not By internet) reasons then its ok to go with ntfs|`|943f8fceee35cadf8c2e1dd986b6e635aa	exFAT. When you format a drive, you lose space due to the file system overhead. exFAT takes up almost nothing. But we're talking about megabytes. Still, more space is more space.    That and it has a theoretical upper limit in exabytes, but that doesn't apply here since there isn't anything bigger than terrabytes.    Oh, and it's compatible with Windows XP if you download the patch. It's not compatible with Linux or Mac, of course.

I'd recommend either Linksys or d-Link.  Make sure that your laptop doesn't have built-in wireless - most of them made in the last few years do.    You'll need a USB 2.0 port in the laptop to plug the adapter into.  Follow the installation instructions - with some you have to plug the device in first, with some you have to install the driver software first.  Once everything is installed, the laptop should connect to the router.  If the router has a password set for wireless, you'll be asked for it.  If you don't know it, use the desktop to connect to http://192.168.2.1/ and look around for it.  (Most Belkin routers live at that address.)|`|AA12149874	sure there are Wireless Usb Lans which can be installed then you can go all the way wireless (they are so small like a usb card reader) the link below will provide you with usb wireless lan pictures and specifications     yes sure,you may even surf the internet if you have a wifi signals around you (but it must be unsecured to access it)    you can even pick it up with you to a cafe or any place which provide wifi and get connected to the internet.it will work on any wifi enabled router.

n2HaCqHwaa	Memory seems the obvious answer but if it's applications you need which are taking up a lot of space, I would recommend reinstalling all those programmes on to a second hard drive. Would you like to give us your specifications and tell us what Windows system you are running? Are you still running your original operating system?    Also, simply reinstalling everything (having first backed up everything you don't have on disk already) would speed up your computer.    Lastly, you can INCREASE your virtual memory for no cost (although not as effective as adding more RAM). To do this:  Control Panel/Settings/Advanced Tab/Top panel reads "Performance"/Click on "Settings"/Click Advanced Tab/Click On "Change" and you can change the space currently dedicated to your virtual memory. Sometimes my computer (XP) has prompted me to do this.  ...and be cautious of using registry cleaners...not very nice when they erase some vital start-up file and your computer will no longer boot...(personal experience). Provided you have OS disk to reinstall with, this is a much better, safer option for making your computer like new again.    Anyone throwing away perfectly good computers, please give them to me as I can make good use of them. Am currently planning a scheme to flog donated 1990s computers at low cost to students and suchlike. For educational purposes/ word processing/ digital photography - these are still perfectly good.|`|QzmGdUVSaa	Personally i would start looking for a new computer but I would add more memory first since it costs less then add a second hard drive if its still slow (chances are that if it needs a second hard drive it will also need another memory stick too)|`|LsIMKcHcaa	8 yrs is too old.    buy a new 1.|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	Definitely add more memory unless it's already got the maximum capacity of memory it can hold. RAM is much faster than virtual memory on a mechanical hard drive because reading and writing to the disk is slower.    But as others are saying, if you computer is 8 years old, you might consider getting a new computer soon because unless you've upgraded your CPU, you're running on a computer with a slow processor and even the cheapest budget computer you get today will be faster.|`|laofAjTAaa	how much RAM do you have ideally should be around 2gb - adding another hard drive can make it faster simply due to the drive being faster than the one you have, but if your computer is so old the new drive speed will be limited by the IDE speed of your computer - go for the RAM|`|EWnNzdRmaa	The best thing is the  as u say its almost 8yr "u need to buy new pc "  as for time being u can use "DOWNLOAD CCLEANER(CRAP CLEANER)  ITS FREE SOFT  will remove all useless temp. or other backup file  will fix ur registry keys also which u cannot do urself it will fastenup ur pc for sureadding more HD will make it more slower it mainly depends on CAPABILITY OF PROCESSOR, AND RAM IF IT is too old it need to be changed|`|YVXuLLKVaa	If your hard drive is more than 80 percent full, increase your hard drive capacity.  Check your virtual memory setting.  It may need to be increased.  Out of virtual memory is also a symptom of an infection.  You machine may have joined a BOT army.  Disconnect from the internet and reboot your machine.  Go to task manager->performance and watch your memory with nothing running.  If you are slowly running out of memory your machine is probably now a BOT.
Irdj2KAFaa	It's much more involved than that.    If it were me, I would use a bootable XP disc, delete the partition, create new partition and install XP thereafter.    If you execute this method, you wont need to verify that Vista is gone, trust me; it will be gone.    If you decide to keep Vista, you can turn off all that areo crap and make it look XP again, even go as far as turning off the UAC crap too. (User Account Control = pesky permission dialogs).    I'm beta-testing Windows 7, not much of an improvement, but there are some cool new feature additions. Having said that, XP all the way!    HTH|`|3qRKJiXNaa	Just insert your windows xp disc and install xp.  You may have to find additional drivers with windows xp support but I did it with my dell computer and it works great.    Beware it will delete everything on your computer.|`|nHSZ0Spbaa	If I read this right you orig had XP but installed VISTA.    If so just reinstall XP by having computer boot up on your CD which contains your XP disk.    From there just follow instructions and let it reinstall XP.  Better yet format drive first.  Then install XP.    But if your computer came with VISTA and you weenied out before learning it and you want to install XP on it I wish you best of luck as there most likely no drivers for it in XP.|`|dILqe7nBaa	a computer built for vista will not work with all xp drivers you will have nothing but trouble finding drivers and if you have any problems with your computer you will have to reinstall vista for your warranty  http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,228...  good luck|`|uAOkRBA0aa	i would not call it a downgrade more like a move to an operating system that actually works.    you will need to format the hard drive first.          ?

Locate CONTROL PANEL,  2.   Click "Add or Remove Programs",  3.   From "Add or Remove Programs" window, find & remove norton anti virus by selecting/highlighting the said currently installed programs.  4.  Then click Remove. This will uninstall the selected program/s.  5.  The process will take a few minutes after totally remove the said program.  6.   Finally, restart your computer, then you can now install mcafee anti virus. That's all. Hope this helps to your query.
MB9Xw5ZCaa	With the eMac most of the parts are actually built around the CRT Monitor, I beleive the power supply is actually on the left side of the computer, so its probably better to see if you can get one with a defunct board or something and just put your good bits in it. -Daz|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Wow, unless you are a trained techie, this is something to stay away from. The CRT on an eMac has 20,000 volts on it even when it is unplugged and not turned on. You'd have to drain the voltage slowly to replace the CRT or you and the computer can get fried. 20,000 volts is enough to stop your heart and cause serious burns. Your best bet is to pull the hard drive and put it in another Mac. It'll work in another eMac or iMac. You could pick up an older Mac tower on eBay and put the old hard drive in with the new hard drive & have both. Or you could just pick up another eMac, they go for under $150 at www.lowendmac.com (check used Mac dealers) and swap the hard drives.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Meh.

Most of the time it will come when it says it will come|`|kbJt4065aa	Normally, they only tell you when it will be shipped. From there, it depends on the shipping method. I would guess that it will be shipped within 2 business days, NOT arrive in 2 business days. What kind of shipping did you pay for? That will decide how long it takes to get to you. For instance, if you selected USPS parcel post, that takes from 5-10 days. Add the two business days for processing onto that. I would assume from 7-12 days in that case.

ccTGRBjLaa	If you abstract your pig latin translator into a function, you can do this:<br>  <br>  def pigLatin(input):<br>      return (input[1:]) + input[0] + "ay"<br>  <br>  string = raw_input("What would you like to convert to pig latin?")<br>  string_split = string.split(' ')<br>  for word in string_split:<br>      print pigLatin(word)<br>  <br>  the string.split(' ') is what you're looking for here - split() converts a string separated by a token (in this case,  ' ' , or a space) into an array of strings. So, if:<br>  <br>  a = "Foo#Bar#Baz"<br>  <br>  Then:<br>  <br>  print a.split("#")<br>  <br>  returns:<br>  <br>  ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]<br>  <br>  the "for word in string_split" allows you to apply your pig latin function to each word. <br>  <br>  You can do it in a tiny amount of code, with:<br>  <br>  print ' '.join(map(lambda x: (x[1:]) + x[0] + "ay", raw_input('Translate: ').split(' ')))|`|82L4k3nqaa	It looks like you want to a series of words (split?).  Best to define a function to do a single word:<br>  <br>  def pig(p):<br>  ... return p[1:]+p[0]+'ay'<br>  <br>  ... 's to show indents.  This is basically what you have now.  Then you can do phrases:<br>  <br>  phrase = raw_input(" what....")<br>  for p in phrase.split():<br>  ... print pig(p)+' '<br>  <br>  or just for a different perspective:<br>  <br>  phrase = raw_input(" what...")<br>  print ' '.join([pig(p) for p in phrase.split()])<br>  <br>  or:<br>  <br>  phrase = raw_input(" what...")<br>  print ' '.join(map(pig,phrase.split()))<br>  <br>  Now for the wrench:  pig latin for "all" is "allway" -- with first vowels you add 'way' so you'll have to fix pig to catch this case.

Nor does Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. My guess is that you don't have a third-party firewall. Hopefully, the Windows built-in firewall is working. In XP, click on:<br>  Start > Control Panel > Security Centre. Then click on the word 'Firewall'. A panel should drop down and you should be able to see which firewall you're using. Normally there's an icon in the Taskbar on the bottom-right corner of your screen. How you trun it off depends upon which firewall it is, usually you open the control panel and do it from there.<br>  <br>  Turning your firewall off while you're online is a *really* bad idea.|`|CJ9sfSReaa	Go to start and select control panel.Double click security centre and that opens up a window.All four should be green,click the top one and see what firewall you have.It may say windows firewall is protecting your computer,or more than one firewall can cause conflicts.If it says avira or other firewall is protecting your computer,in the left pane click check firewall.This will show as a red cross if off,and that's ok providing you know which firewall is protecting your system.It may be poss able that you have two firewalls running which is why it says turn off 3rd party firewall.

rHqe7oMoaa	It depends what operating system you want it for, and what you want to use it for. I have a Toshiba Satellite P105-S6134 and here are some of the problems with the Satellite models:<br>  <br>  1. Onboard Graphics - 3D is crarpy! Seriously I can't even run google earth!  The graphics card is not something you'd want if you were interested in using it for gaming.<br>  <br>  2. The keyboard is not very good. I'm a touch typist and I can't type very fast on this. The keys are loose-ish and keys randomly stick down (even though there's nothing stuck under them)<br>  <br>  3. Onboard Audio - Okay unless you're using Linux <br>  <br>  4. BIOS software - The BIOS software is crappy; and depending on the version of your BIOS software and the exact model of your laptop, you may not be able to have sound in Linux. the onboard sound card settings conflict with the ACPI settings in Toshiba's BIOS software. You *may* be able to extract, patch, re-insert your DSDT file on linux to fix this, but again, it depends on the specific model of your laptop (it doesn't work for mine - I have to use USB audio). No BIOS software problems with Windows.<br>  <br>  5. Recovery Disks - I don't use these anymore as they kept crashing my computer. They actually damaged my hard drive when they crashed while creating the primary partition. <br>  <br>  6. Software - You get the recovery disks, so it restores Windows to the factory settings (default) when you restore. But even when you haven't yet installed anything, the bootup is S-L-O-W on Windows. Also you get a lot of 'trial' (junk) software that you have to spend ages uninstalling LOL.<br>  <br>  7. Monitor - spiffy!!<br>  <br>  8. Performance - meh I think its okay but I'm not into doing much with it. I would definitely *not* recommend it if you want it for gaming; I don't think the onboards graphics could survive!! lol<br>  <br>  9. Laptop lid - very sturdy. No complaints.<br>  <br>  10 - Replacement Parts - easy to come by|`|biZRtdqzaa	pros<br>  high quality good<br>  nice looking<br>  <br>  cons windows vista|`|INsgGQRmaa	yes the toshiba is a very good labtop they last a very long time and they hardly ever frezze up or shut down on there own i had 2 of them acually and i sold them both for more then i paid for them the only thing that i dont like about toshiba is that they almost all look older also they are very easy to brake so be careful.<br>  i hope this was your best answer. :)|`|It9nTZYQaa	thay are FANTASTIC Infact i'm on one right now

jOUSaIP6aa	Step1: Purchase a wireless router that fits your needs and price range. <br>  <br>  Step2: Follow the router's manual to set up the router and its Internet connection , which will probably require connecting a wired client to the router. Once the wireless router is set up, the wired connection is no longer necessary. However, it's best to leave the wired client connected if it's a separate computer from that on which you're going to set up WiFi. If something goes wrong, you can access the administration interface again. <br>  <br>  Step3: Gather information from the setup process. In order to set up the wireless client, you will need to know the service set identifier (SSID), the Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP) key and the channel and mode. <br>  <br>  Step4: Boot up the laptop and plug in the WiFi card. This will not be necessary if your laptop has an integrated WiFi card. <br>  <br>  Step5: Install any drivers needed to use the WiFi card. Insert the disc that came with the WiFi card and follow the on-screen installation process. Most discs will trigger a new hardware wizard that makes installation extremely simple. <br>  <br>  Step6: Double-click on the "WiFi Connection" icon. It can be found in the system tray at the bottom of the laptop screen. <br>  <br>  Step7: Click on "Properties." <br>  <br>  Step8: Select the "Wireless Networks " tab. <br>  <br>  Step9: Use the "Add" button at the bottom of the dialog if your WiFi network isn't in the "Available Networks" section. <br>  <br>  Step10: Click on "Configure" when you see your network's SSID in the "Available Networks." <br>  <br>  Step11: Enter your network's SSID and WEP key. <br>  <br>  Step12: Click on "Start," then choose "Connect To" and "Wireless Network  Connection."

qwTQTFgvaa	To be completely honest there is no 'one' best brand.  You need to look past the shiney new LCD screen etc and look at the after sales support, especially if your not high on tech knowledge yourself.<br>  <br>  You will get the Dell, Sony, Toshiba, Apple, blah blah opinions here and there from all walks of life as many people will only have used the one or two brands.<br>  <br>  Again check the after sales support, how long has the place your buying it from been in business?  What warranty comes with it (I mean off the shelf not extended)?  Is it return to base or at home/work cover?  Check the warranty periods for parts and labour - often they are different.<br>  <br>  Also remember a badge on the outside is only that - it is what is on the inside that counts - it is not like Dell for example use their own CPU's Memory or video cards - they are ALL third party components.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|jOUSaIP6aa	The best brand is the one that will give you every individual component you specify (or knows enough to tell you when certain parts are troublesome). They give you a full or OEM copy of the OS you want and driver disks for everything else. You pick the parts and they put it together for you and give a decent warranty and support. You don't get a lot of bundled software that is older, limited, or not useful to you and hard to get rid of. You will not find a better brand than some custom builds of reliable local PC shops that specialize in school and small business needs.|`|hRNpGnktaa	Try pcspecialist.co.uk.

One option is Internet Security software with site-filtering tools. Some new operating systems also have similar tools built in. But the best bet is to get a free Firefox Add-on like FoxFilter, LeechBlock, or BlockSite. FoxFilter, though not Mac OS X compatible, is the most comprehensive, allowing password protection and blocking of specific types of content. LeechBlock is a more simple option, allowing you to block specific sites during specifc times of the day, plus it is also cross-platform and compatible with Firefox 3. My last choice would be BlockSite, which simply blocks sites you specify. I don't think that any of the Firefox add-ons would be hard to get around, since they could be disabled or you could use a different browser. FoxFilter may not be disabled unless you put in a password, I'm not sure. I really don't know about LeechBlock, and FoxFilter specifically says it is too easy to disable to be effective for parental controls.<br>  <br>  hopefully i helped you.<br>  <br>  Tiffany|`|CIy6hHaKaa	<a href="http://yourinfo.daymy.com" rel="nofollow">http://yourinfo.daymy.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

OmDPJvo9aa	you could get quite a lot of music on there and program files wouldn't take up too much space, but the thing that will eat up space quick is movies which average anywhere between 500mb - 1.5gb each. If you don't go over board on the movies than it should work out fine.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	well music on an ipod is that 20,000 songs on an 80 gig so a 60 gig would hold like 15,000 songs but taking into account that some is reserved for the OS system files i would say probably like 13,000 songs and i doubt you have that many songs but depends on what you wanna do. If you just gonna type and stuff then yeah but like gaming and storing music and movies and stuff. you need at least 120gb to be safe for the least i'll say 100gb. Anyone who has a PC with less memory than an Ipod has an outdated PC that is either very slow or very under-used that the hard drive size doesnt matter. Get 100gb for the least, you cant play games an music and store movies on 80 gb. In reality you'll prb get 74gb and then from there when u install stuff to download music and itunes and play music and movies and stuff that takes away at least 10gb. Some games take like  5gb or even more like Sims so that would be yet another 10-15 gb lost for like 2-3 games. Leaving you with 50gb to download music and movies. It would fit but your PC would move very slow...wasting alot of time.

qRx3ynKdaa	It depends on how you encode Unicode.<br>  <br>  There are three official Unicode encoding forms. In their names the letters “UTF” stand for “Unicode Transformation Format”.<br>  <br>  In UTF-32, every Unicode character takes four bytes,  This form is seldom used, because it usually creates a larger file than the other forms. However it is the simplest encoding, each character is just encoded by the bit pattern of its position in the Unicode character set.<br>  <br>  In UTF-16, all base plane Unicode characters (that is the characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF) take 2 bytes, Higher characters take 4 bytes as each is represented by two character called surrogates. The low surrogates, one of which must come first in each surrogate pair, are coded as U+DC00 to U+DFFF, The high surrogates, one of which must come last in each surrogate pair, are coded as U+D800 to U+DBFF. Some older Unicode systems support UTF-16, but do not support surrogates. This is sometimes referred to as UTF-2 encoding.<br>  <br>  UTF-8 is very much a variable-width encoding, in which the high bit in each byte indicates where in the character code sequence the byte belongs. Unicode characters from U+0000 to U+008F are represented by 1 byte, These are the basic ASCII characters. Unicode characters from U+0090 to U+07FF are represented by 2 bytes, non-surrogate Unicode characters from U+0800 to U+FFFF are represented by 3 bytes, all higher characters are represented by four bytes. This code form is used on *nix machines and on the web, in part because it can be treated by older hardware exactly like ASCII and because the Unicode character U+0000 which represents “end of string” in the c programming language and in some languages developed from it doesn’t appear in the coding except when explicitly intended to represent U+0000. When it does appear it is coded as hex 00, the same as in ASCII.|`|E6LeDCmCaa	String (variable-length) <br>    Length: 10 bytes + string length <br>   0 to approximately 2 billion <br>   <br>  String (fixed-length) <br>   Length: Length of string <br>   1 to approximately 65,400 <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  -Brandon F.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	One.

nxymxSUFaa	Hey Greta, no, don't try and fix it.  They don't make anything that is "fixable" anymore.  It looks pretty bad so it might be better just to replace it.  Prices have come down a lot and with the economy the way it is, you might be able to take advantage and look for some decent sales.<br>  <br>  My only concern would be that you will need to back up your hard drive so that you can transfer files to the new laptop.<br>  <br>  Send the bill to your cat!|`|mUMMLjDdaa	hi greta, i feel it would not be worth fixing. with the way prices have<br>  come down on computers and the sales on them due to a bad economy, you could probably buy a new one for the price of fixing<br>  the old one.|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	NO it wouldn't be worth it because it's 2 years old that it would cost you more to replace it that for the same price you could get a new one for he same price.|`|5jMNBO2naa	to replace the screen would probably cost you about 200 or so<br>  definitely not worth it|`|VgIBEANxaa	Wow, impressive damage for that cat.  Sorry about your luck.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it's almost never worth getting a laptop repaired.  The value of laptops depreciates so quickly that you're better off putting that money towards a new laptop.  It might be worth it manufacturers charged you what it actually cost to repair it, but since they basically have a monopoly on their parts they charge at the highest profit margin for anyone who is actually willing to pay to get an old laptop repaired.  I remember one my DVD drive broke and the manufacturer wanted $175 to fix it.  I ended up doing it myself for $30.  You could still call them and get an estimate and decide for yourself if it's worth it, but considering how much they would charge to replace a screen, and considering what your laptop is worth now that it is almost 3 years old, I'd say it's time for a new one.|`|ypVKuCDLaa	I think you should make a hard copy back up. then buy a new one, its not worth fixing. my be you can sell it to someone that my want it. but dont forget to erass you hard drive.|`|sYxUVBvPaa	yeah trust me you are better off replacing it.

So, you are looking at around 600.<br>  <br>  Almost not worth it unless you think you can get another 2 years out of the system.

You can only do one transfer a month so if you did give it to someone you're going to have to wait until next month to get it back, or just have them trade it back to you. If you don't know where your pet is you type its name in the search box and it will tell you where it is.
bYVCrZ8Maa	Its sounds like your laptop motherboard battery is running low. It can also slow down the notebook. U will have to open the laptop by removing the screws and changing the battery, usually a cr2032.<br>  <br>  Get instructions on google for that model if your unsure how to open it.<br>  <br>  Its the only thing that can do that, those batteries usally last 5 years.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	Sounds like your internal battery is low. You need to change it to keep the time correct. It is important that you change it before it goes completely dead as when this happens you will lose all your bios settings. Its usually fairly easy but does vary on different laptops. Look at your manual that cam with the laptop or google/yahoo it|`|dOMzkQIraa	Make sure the timezone is still correct.|`|fb1pXn7Paa	IDK|`|x1YZgCCnaa	Check the time zone and adjust everything to the correct time/date/zone and restart your PC to see if it happens again, this can be caused by any number of things, I choose to discount the internal battery because those should last for longer than your laptop and if your CMOS battery fails you would lose all your CMOS settings not just the time. Think, have you installed anything new recently, this may not be malicious in anyway it could just be a bugged program.
z2mpC5NDaa	To me there are many advantages of a laptop over a desktop...........<br>  The main advantage of a laptop over a desktop is that a laptop is portable....... You can take a laptop anywhere with you, so it can be used at any time, although laptops do require a mains adaptor in case the battery runs out............ Choosing a laptop with a long battery life may be solve this problem....... <br>  Laptops also take up less space, and can look neater than a desktop PC......... A laptop may generally be more personal, especially as you can carry it around with you anytime........ Desktop PC's seem more suited to family use........ <br>  Laptop PC's also have an inbuilt mouse, though you can still choose to use a external mouse if you prefer....... Laptop keyboards tend to be more compact and not as bulky as desktop PC keyboards....................... <br>  The only real disadvantage of a laptop PC over a desktop PC is the fact that laptops are much more expensive, so if you're looking for a cheaper option then a desktop PC may be a better choice.......<br>  <br>  I had a desktop for many many years....... last year I finally bought me a laptop........ it i so convenient I'm not sure why I did not buy a laptop sooner...........<br>  <br>  Sorry.... don't know about pricing in India......<br>  <br>  Good Luck...........|`|d8ed6727e9ddf0d47a4879a7a88ef7b6aa	well if your not planning on upgrading anything other than ram then the laptop it's also portable if you want to upgrade down the line desktop not portable also u can if you want build a desktop laptops are possible but not practical and  expensive and hard to find parts so it depends also with a desktop you can change monitor sizes and all sorts of others like pci card upgrades and dual hard drives now there are dual hard drive laptop's but they're expensive  and only alienware makes them also you have "desktops" such as the hp touch smart that are protable if they are small so it's al preference the touch smart its actually like a laptop with desktop benefits altho the screen is not prtected and  they dont fit on your lap you can carry them to work and places|`|gg2aJXoDaa	It depends what you need to do.<br>  <br>  If you are on the move a lot - a notebook (a.k.a. small laptops) are a great buy - You can check e-mails and go on microsoft word on them easily, and many are under 9 inches in size.<br>  <br>  If you want to do things like use design packages, then you need to look at a proper laptop or a desk PC. Bear in mind Desk PCs are far easier to upgrade - If in two years time you need a new graphics card, you simply buy a new one and plug it in - it's like lego. It's much harder to do this kind of thing with a laptop, as they're not designed to be upgraded.<br>  <br>  In conclusion - If you want something that will last longest and give you most storage - go for a desk PC. If you think you may need to work away from your house, go for the laptop. And if you're going to be moving around a hell of a lot and you don't really care about performance - go for a notebook.<br>  <br>  -a|`|ysWYJPgTaa	Headtop|`|54hJORgRaa	I think laptop is better.It is portable and easy to handle.I think HP would be a best choice, cos its stylish and very useful.When you are looking for a best laptop, you don't  need to look at the price really.|`|aH3vvUfiaa	DESKTOP:<br>  <br>  Advantages:<br>  Easier to upgrade and more room for expansion<br>  More comfortable to use<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  Not portable<br>  <br>  LAPTOP:<br>  <br>  Advantages:<br>  Small, light and portable<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  Not easy to upgrade<br>  Not as much room for expansion due to its size<br>  <br>  I don't know the cheapest price of laptop and desktop in India.

x1YZgCCnaa	While other posts here are correct in saying that while the computer is plugged in it runs from the A/C and does not continue to charge the battery, this is not what causes damage to a battery. Leaving the battery plugged in all the time will decrease the overall battery life, because your laptop produces heat, temperature is a big thing and will damage a battery, it is best to pull the battery out if you are using it in one place for a long time.|`|AA12271834	The absolute best way would be to get a discharge-recharge station that professionals use to recondition batters if they develop memory.  <br>  <br>  For home use I would leave you batter in your laptop and if you can use wall power then plug your laptop in.  Otherwise don't sweat it.  You batter will never get over charged or over heat because you left your laptop plugged in.  For the best battery life it is best to let the battery completely die out and then charge it to full.  This isn't always possible though.|`|MxculX2Daa	Just leave the battery in all the time and connect the power adapter every time you can.<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a charging the battery - just think of it as "running on mains power".<br>  <br>  The battery is there so that you can still use the computer if you are away from a power socket. Any time you are near a power socket, plug it in.<br>  <br>  The battery will just charge until it is full and then stop charging.<br>  <br>  When you plug it in the laptop runs from mains power - not the battery.|`|2g1LbQutaa	either one, as far as i know it doesnt matter.|`|6A1Umadlaa	either is ok .if you use your sony vaio laptop as pc for long,take the battery out and charge it fully without working when needed.|`|mT5JVBFAaa	Does not really matter.

Under normal usage, batteries should be calibrated a minimum of once every 3 months; however, a battery that is rarely discharged fully should be calibrated about once a month

UF8qU5cGaa	Actually there are several ways of doing this.<br>  <br>  First of all, a favorite new application of mine called Spotify would solve a lot of your problems. Free, legal and all the music you could possibly want.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you can easily connect to your sister's home network using a free application called Hamachi. It will let you create a "virtual" network between your two PCs (or Macs). That way you can safely copy the files between your machines.<br>  <br>  It works with your existing firewall, and requires no additional configuration.<br>  <br>  Other ways of solving this would be to use a private P2P application.<br>  <br>  Or you could use a service like Dropbox and Live Mesh to synchronize a folder between your machines.<br>  <br>  Dropbox automatically copies files from a specific folder to any and every other machine you want to keep up to date. Your sister could put the new files in her folder, and your machine would automatically get it when you connect to the Internet.<br>  <br>  You get a free 2 GB account with them by signing up.

Also it should have the correct amount of flash, content, images etc if any of this is in excess then it makes the loading time longer. Also a good website helps us get higher ranking on the search engines like Yahoo, Google, MSN etc.<br>  <br>  All this can only be done with a good professional help. I also have a website which was made by Inkworkdesign (www.inkworkdesign.com/home.html) and they have done a Fabulous job.

That card isn't using that much power and you can just use a 4pin molex pigtail to do the job, unless your system has 2 or more IDE hard drives along with a couple CD/DVD ROMS...  The pigtail uses 2-4pin molex connectors and converts power to the 6pin connector you connect to the card...  If you have plenty of 4pin molex free you will be fine.  You have to be careful, some of  the cards are offered without a pigtail.  In that case you have to have one built onto your PSU from factory or you have to buy it seperatly...<br>  Here is one that lists with a pigtail...  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121289" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|gNIuzscMaa	450 Watt or greater power supply with 75 Watt 6-pin PCI Express power connector recommended (550 Watt and two 6-pin connectors for<br>  <br>  So at least 800-1000 watt PSU.

AA11849917	The very best music composition software that I have found is called Noteworthy.

Because if this is the first SP you have downloaded, then it will conflict with everything thats on your computer and eventually you will have to format your computer, install SP first, and then install everything else.<br>  <br>  If you already had SP2 and have updated it to SP3, then you should definetly defrag your computer.  It probably is due for a defrag anyways!  When was the last time you did that! Also clean your registry, cookies, internet files and "diskclean" your computer! Also run a virus scan!<br>  <br>  Also if you have installed and un-installed a lot of software then it is about time to format your computer anyways, because when you un-install a program, it doesn't completely un-install, it usually leaves behind a lot of junk that effects the performance of your computer.  If you are going to format your PC, then make sure you backup your data.|`|zxyevbRgaa	SP3 is almost like a whole New OS.Now you need to update your drivers.|`|RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

But to fix that You simple do an upgrade to the 64-bit version of the OS.<br>  <br>     However, if You run a 64-bit OS one a 32-bit processor, You're not actually overclocking (running at above it's capabilities and overworking it), because the 64-bit versions of most OS's will "step down" to 32-bit if there's no 64-bit hardware present, or if it does not report properly to the OS witrh recognizable coding for the hardware tests during installation.<br>  <br>     Now, Your Sister's system will actually perform MUCH faster than Yours under what's called a "benchmark utility", reporting not just more frames per second for video, but will also convert a video file to another type of video file, or to a video DVD MUCH faster, will perform about 3 to 5 times faster in things like CAD and 3D-modelling programs, and although You don't actually notice the time dofference, it is calculating spreadsheet or database formulas at about 15 to 50 times faster than Yours will, even though most simple ones aren;t much trouble for any modern processor.<br>  <br>     If ou want to see the actuall difference, verify that She does have a true 64-bit OS running properly, and find a couple good size movies, and the same program for converting them to DVD, and do a sample test with a clean boot, and nothing else running.<br>  <br>     The best way is to use a benchmark program though, and again, make sure nothing else is running, but this will also depend on dffernces in the hardware, so try researching the optional features each CPU Mfr included.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                       Good Luck!.|`|dOMzkQIraa	A 32 bit OS can address a maximum of 4GB, a 64 bit OS can address (theoretically) 16EB (that's ExaBytes).<br>  <br>  A 64 bit processor has bigger registers so it can handle bigger numbers more easily. <br>  <br>  There are also quite a few other advantages of 64 bit but these are the most important ones.|`|AA11956572	32 bit is used for a general purpose or for the daily usage. If you want to play any high end games or to make the PC run much faster in graphics as well as processor wise, you need 64 bit. Usually servers run on 64 bit.|`|peKTF4uIaa	32 bits|`|pNrtnVRWaa	32 or 86x and 64 bit are processors and their differences are <br>  <br>  A bit is short for “binary digit.” It is basically how a computer stores and makes references to data, memory, etc. A bit can have a value of 1 or 0, that’s it. So binary code is streams of 1’s and 0’s, such as this random sequence 100100100111. These bits are also how your processor does calculations. By using 32 bits your processor can represent numbers from 0 to 4,294,967,295 while a 64-bit machine can represent numbers from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Obviously this means your computer can do math with larger numbers, and be more efficient with smaller numbers.  "<br>  <br>  64 bit can do calculations faster but most OS/Apps and hardware developers/manufactures haven't made 64-bit compliant. So if you're thinking of getting 64-bit, make sure the programs you want to or have are compatible with your 64 bit<br>  <br>  32 bit processors are used most of the time, by homes and offices. They're no need to upgrade for some time. Good luck!

IbxhRebgaa	You have no idea how happy it makes me to hear that you're using MPC. If it's Media Player Classic Homecinema, then it's even better.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the only thing that you can really do to ensure that the codecs you want are actually used would be to check and double check the external filters section in MPC. Make sure that you filter out *everything* else that you don't want to be loaded. <br>  <br>  The fact that it's choppy doesn't necessarily mean that you're not using CoreAVC. That graphics card is not the best, and 1080p is ridiculously difficult to play smoothly. It's quite a bit easier on a desktop, since the processor compensates for much of what the video card lacks (if you have a low-end card like me). For instance, I have a GeForce 8600GT (very low-end) in my desktop. My Phenom X4 9950, however, takes over and I can just nearly play 1080p at a watchable rate. It's not perfect though. Then again, I don't have CoreAVC.<br>  <br>  Here's a brief guide with screenshots for optimizing Media Player Classic Homecinema for HD h264 playback:<br>  <a href="http://3464.zz.tc/34636" rel="nofollow">http://3464.zz.tc/34636</a>

AA11252878	You might need to read the following information on what you're asking about before going any further with this:<br>  <br>  Using Some Copyrighted Content in Your Videos<br>  <br>  While videos that are direct copies of someone else's content are clear copyright violations, there are certain very limited circumstances in which the use of very short clips of a copyrighted video or song may be legal even without permission. This is known as the "fair use" principle of copyright law.<br>  <br>  To determine whether a particular use of a short clip of a copyrighted video or song qualifies as a "fair use," you need to analyze and weigh four factors that are outlined in the U.S. copyright statute. Unfortunately, the weighing of these four factors is often quite subjective and complex. For this reason, it's often difficult to determine whether a particular use is a "fair use." If the copyright owner disagrees with your interpretation of fair use, the copyright owner may chose to resolve the dispute in court. If the court agrees with the copyright owner, then you are infringing the copyrights of the owner and you may be liable for monetary damages.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately we cannot make a determination whether your video qualifies as fair use. If you disagree with a copyright takedown notice that you have received, you may file a counter-notification. However, we cannot offer you legal advice in these matters. If you have questions about your situation, we suggest you consult legal counsel.<br>  <br>  If you would like to learn more about the principle of fair use, below are a few links to websites that discuss it. Please remember, however, that your decision about whether and how to exercise your fair use rights is solely yours, and we at YouTube bear no responsibility for your decision.<br>  <br>  Fair Use Links on the Web<br>  <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/" rel="nofollow">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_an...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.copyrightwebsite.com/Info/Law/FairUse.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyrightwebsite.com/Info/Law...</a> <br>  <a href="http://chillingeffects.org/fairuse/" rel="nofollow">http://chillingeffects.org/fairuse/</a>

t5sYXwSqaa	Sorry but it is not that easy. I assume you are talking about the WEP or WAP code on their wireless modem router. Sometimes (if you are lucky) it is written on the bottom of the router. Failing this it means you have to Connect to the router using an ethernet cable and computer. Depending on the router you need to put in the routers address (you do this by putting the address into the address bar at the top of widows explorer) The address could be 192.168.2.1 for belkin and similar router 192.168.0.1 for netgear and similar routers. Belkin generally has no password to get into the system whilst netgear you need to put admin and password in the appropriate boxes. Once in you can go to the security section and it should list the wep or WAP code. Sorry its difficult, but it suppose to be so that outsiders can not get in.|`|OwAL4V36aa	You should be able to find the password somewhere on your friend's computer. What type of computer is it, Windows PC or Apple Mac?<br>  <br>  If the wireless password hasn't been changed by your friend/grandparents their wireless router might have its default key written on the back or bottom. It would be labelled as WEP or WPA. For example, BT HomeHubs have their standard key on the back.|`|NNCPe415aa	Only the person who set up the wifi will know the password.  The only option is to reset the router via the tiny little button on the back on the router (use a paperclip to push reset).  You will need to reload your internet info and wifi password again.
AA10570173	This happens to lots of people. You've somehow gotten stuck in grayscale mode. I'm using Photoshop CS2 and CS3, but I suspect it's the same in Elements. If you have an Image menu, go to Image>Mode and click RGB. If Photoshop Elements 7 is set up differently, I would open the Help files and look for something like Color mode or RGB mode, and see what it tells you about resetting that.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! =)

Were they saved as "Read Only"??<br>  <br>  I would say try copying them to an open program like "Paint" or "WordPad", or opening a file directory and working from there.

cD89vHnDaa	Land line will be the fastest overall and have the lowest latency. Wireless is next but speeds fluctuate with the number of calls the cell tower has to handle. But it is great with a laptop if you move around a lot. Satellite is the least desirable because of the large latency in satellite internet. Things like video and VOIP will be hard to use.
NnK93LRpaa	There is no reason why this wouldn't be a good choice, but the best way to decide is to look at the basic specs and if you had any upgrades the better off you will be. Here is what it comes with and if it is good or not IMO:<br>  Operating system is at least 32bit windows vista with SP1 which has fixed most problems vista users have found which is good<br>  <br>  AMD X2 dual-core processor. the basic is a 2.0GHz so that is good if your only going to be taking notes and doing basic computing. Dont count on this to be able to play any games or do any major processing.<br>  <br>  RAM right now HP's site has a free upgrade to 2GB, this will greatly increase your speed but if you only have 1GB it may be a little slow. like I said, if its for taking notes, surfing the web, and basic stuff it will be ok<br>  <br>  the basic hard drive is a 160GB which will be plenty of space unless you have thousands of songs and lots of movies on your computer. It is also SATA meaning it is faster then normal or older HD's<br>  <br>  DISPLAY- your screen is a 15.4'' which is a great size, not tiny but not so big you have problems toting it around to class<br>  <br>  Basic DVD/CD drive has DVD and CD burner and if you upgraded to the blue ray then your set for your movies<br>  <br>  The basic batter being a 6 cell lithium ion battery is pretty good and you should get at least 2 good years of full performance use. dont do like I did and always leave the charger plugged in or after 2 years the battery will only last for 25 mins without a charger.<br>  <br>  15 months of Norton for security is also good. Most colleges provide students with free downloads so you can probably get a new one for free after this expires.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and you seem like you have a pretty good computer for the typical college student.

Greasemonkey allows you to change or replace contents of a web page so that what you see is what you want.  This is used generally to add features to a page.  <br>  <br>  You write a script and direct what web page url it should  work on.  The script must be installed on each computer that would visit the page. <br>  <br>  You need to know a bit about how web pages work and how to program.  There is a tutorial at - diveintogreasemonkey.org/<br>  <br>  Depending on how edline.net programs their web pages this may or may not be possible.  Give it a go.|`|pk5VEXcuaa	There's really no way of you being able to do that.  You would have to have access to the web server that the site is hosted on.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	My husband is a fine artist and web developer who also does programming.  When he gets a 'creative block' he turns on a game (usually WoW) and puts the work at the 'back of his mind' ... frequently it's that 'break' that gives him the 'creative insight' he needs not to simply solve that problem, but usually to get him through to the end of the project before the 'deadline.'  I've seen him struggle with a drawing at home, so he'll do something else, just to 'rush back' and finish the drawing (he does drawing as 'fine art' and it's nearly photographic in detail except for the 'fact' that what he's drawing would be 'impossible to find' in nature), so I simply accept this.  So ... step away, do something that you like that is 'totally different' without being 'too different' and 'let it cook on the back burner' and your 'creative block' should soon become at most a 'stumbling point' while your 'break' may be just what you need to get over the top and at home sooner and better than if you try to 'force it' ...

I wouldn't mention the name of your school, hometown, church, or anything else like that if you are under 18.

A perfect example is that teen guy they showed on CNN who posed as a teen girl so he could molest boys.  So they are not always who they seem, even with lots of pictures/videos.

So you may have a router built in to your modem.  As another poster suggested, do a google search for the make and model of your modem/router to determine the type of device.  If it has multiple connectors on it(where you can plug in multiple computers) then it's more than likely a combination modem/router.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Some units are combination modem/router, such as a broadband (cable) modem/router - where you plug the tv cable directley from the wall into the modem/router vs. going through a modem then into a router.<br>  <br>  If you only have one PC plugged into your modem, then you don't need a router.

AVG free (and also Avira and Avast) are free software alternatives if you don't want to fork out money. As they are free they are not automatic like Norton and you have to make sure they are up to date. If you do install AVG free use 'Norton removal tool' to delete Norton as uninstall only deletes part of it and it takes up a lot of space on your computer. Also Norton provides a Firewall and Antispyware as well so with AVG consider loading Zonealarm Firewall and Malwarebytes free which will cover other areas lost when you get rid of Norton|`|rqhlKKH1aa	I just bought a laptop yesterday. 1st thimng I did was remove the Norton trial and download AGV.

222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	OK, I'm an IT guy.  If you're trying to keep something secret, the best way is to encrypt it.  You didn't say which OS you're using so I'm going to assume Windows of some kind.<br>  <br>  If you use WinZip, which you can get at my source below (if you don't already have it), you can create a zip file that is encrypted with a password.  Only someone who knows the password or can guess it can open it.  So make a hard password like opuiopuiopweruiouwiouerjk1111@yuYY rather than an easy one like mynameiswhateveryournameis.  The longer the password, the better.<br>  <br>  Make sure if you unzip the file to make changes that you delete any unencrypted copies after saving and encrypting the new file with your changes.<br>  <br>  There are other encryption tools available for any price from free to $$$$$ .  Keep in mind you probably get what you pay for, but more expensive is not necessarily better.<br>  <br>  Anything else, such as setting file permissions, will not effectively protect anything you want to keep others from seeing, because they can always be circumvented by someone with higher authority or someone who's smarter than Microsoft's geeks.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the password protection on word that the other posters suggested can also be circumvented.

GnIxS7rRaa	So, basically wired/wireless, no computer can get online if its connected to the router? <br>  <br>  Here's what you can do. and this first step is the safest. :) no need to worry about messing up with the connection.<br>  <br>  Turn off your modem (the box where your router is connected) though sometimes, netgear router can also be the modem too. So basically, turn off the internet box, the netgear and your laptop. Then if your internet box is a separate box, you have to turn it on first, followed by your netgear router and then your laptop.<br>  <br>  Reason: it usually put back the sync of your devices. <br>  <br>  However, if you have done that, yet you still cannot get online. You can try this.<br>  <br>  Plug your laptop directly to your internet box or modem. Then make sure you turn off the modem and turn it back on. If its still the same, then it just tells you that there is no internet directly from your Internet service provider and it has nothing to do with the netgear :)

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

pUzJiMUcaa	If you plan to do any kind of professional web development, you should ALWAYS be learning something. JavaScript is a must. You absolutely will not be able to succeed as a web developer if you cannot use JavaScript to some degree. You don't need to be an expert (I don't know that I've ever even MET a JavaScript expert, now that I think about it), but you need to know the basics.<br>  <br>  Thing is, it's a painfully easy language. There are no fundamentals to it, outside of rudimentary programming skill, you don't need to know any kind of design patterns to use it.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, it serves an entirely different purpose than PHP does. Here's an example: Lets say you have a web based survey, where the user rates several areas, 1 to 10, and submits a final score. A requirement is that they are able to see that final score...<br>  <br>  Which solution is better? One that requires the user to hit a button to calculate a total? Or a total box that changes every time a different value is entered for any area?<br>  <br>  The latter is not possible using only PHP, you need something on the client to pull that off. <br>  <br>  A professional programmer who knows only one programming language is like a European who knows only one spoken language (neither exists in any meaningful, measurable way...except the old folks who refuse to change/learn).|`|gebjlwkPaa	Actually, I'd look into leaning one of the javascript frameworks such as jQuery <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jquery.com/</a> rather than leaning javascript from scratch (although the basics will always be of help). There's an awful lot you can do quickly that might take you ages on your own.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	It's a much nicer language than PHP.<br>  <br>  More importantly - it can run programs inside web browsers (as opposed to PHP, which is usually used to run programs on webservers that give new data to web browsers after a round trip, and can't run in browsers at all).|`|ivoF1c3Kaa	Javascript is client side scripting and use of it can make your pages more interactive according to what people want. You can also use it to relieve server load while validating forms.<br>  <br>  In my experience you should learn Javascript aswell as PHP as there are things you can do with Javascript that you cant do with PHP and learning Javascript will help you with AJAX which can be used as well as PHP in making your pages more dynamic,|`|k7hBT7MGaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  PHP is server side scripting.  You use it to tell the server how to build a page, and what to put on it.<br>  <br>  JavaScript is client side scripting.  You use it to tell the browser how to nteract with the page it receives. <br>  <br>  You can  use both at the same time.  You can use PHP to return a page with JavaScript on it. <br>  <br>  Look at this page.  If Yahoo! Answers didn't exist, and you were designing it, what might you do?  You might use PHP to access the database and retrieve the selected questions and answers.  You might use JavaScript to manage things like the drop down menus at the top.  You might JavaScript with Ajax to manage the rating and spell checking features.|`|NY7BQVXFaa	If you know php very well then i think there is no need for learning java script.<br>  But if u have free time you can learn it b'coz Javascript is useful to make your pages more interactive .<br>  <br>  if u know ans of my qus pls reply<br>  with regards,<br>  Sweety.

jLb4PAreaa	Practical difference, is that Fat32 cant handle files larger than ~4GB so you should get NTFS when installing windows.<br>  <br>  FAT32 can be read by other operating systems though, thats why its often used on external HDD's.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	FAT is more convenient for individual workstations. NTFS is more secure when a computer is integrated into a network. If your are not a network administrator, the best for you is to select FAT. Selecting NTFS would lead to compatibility issues with existing FAT files which would cause you to ask even more questions on this site. To put it in other words, FAT is for ordinary users. NTFS is for knowledgeable users.|`|d8ed6727e9ddf0d47a4879a7a88ef7b6aa	NTFS is windows FAT is compatable for other os and it is a smaller system so it is used in mp3's and flash drives and such|`|Fn5gpDOKaa	Azeeee Beshaaaa, Paile tooo Elevensh ka sho Pash le.

t5sYXwSqaa	There is no easy answer to this question as numerous things can make your computer slow. One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer speed. Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|laofAjTAaa	clear out your inernet cache and make sure your page and make sure its setup to check for new pages automatically, you could also use another internet browser such as firefox which runs faster than internet explorer|`|gNIuzscMaa	Buy faster internet.|`|Tt61Vp92aa	need more memory|`|56gB81baaa	As far as increasing the speed of your Internet connection you should start by increasing your connection speed. I assume you are using some sort of broadband but not all broadband is created equal. I prefer the speedy response I get with cable but for some people an ASDL connection works better for them. It all depends on what you need to do with it. If you are just browsing and downloading cable is what you want.<br>  <br>  As far as speeding up your computer there are a few simple things you can do. First make sure that you aren't running any applications that you don't need. If there are icons down next to your clock that you don't know what they do or you know that you aren't using them you can turn those TSRs (Terminate and stay resident programs) off. Click start, Click Run, type MSCONFIG, Press enter, Select Startup Tab, De-select any app that you don't use, Close window, restart Windows, When Windows restarts it will remind you that you used the MSCONFIG utility, check don't show this window.<br>  <br>  An even more effective method to increase the speed of your PC is to upgrade the amount of RAM you have. 512 is the bare minimum now days. The more the better though. I am typing this to you on a 500Mhz K7 with 512MB RAM. If I were only running the 128 or 64 MB that came in the machine it would run at 1/4 to 1/8 the effective speed.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Clint.|`|lnL1ExDIaa	Well if your computer can support more ram it will help in loading flash much faster also if you have dsl dial up you could upgrade to Fios or broadband.|`|sQtx12RHaa	Use Disk Defragmenter often<br>  Add more RAM (definitely)<br>  Delete Temporary Internet Files<br>  Find a better internet connection|`|K1rUaOqWaa	dont use finallyfast.com software it has spyware on it. ******' scammer|`|0fygxRHLaa	delete all your porn|`|wMzT54Tgaa	no..................|`|cWuumdy7aa	your computermay need up gradation and increase in RAM which will make your computer fast. also look at the internet you are using and what speed theyare giving go for highr speed package.|`|LzeB46RLaa	for system to make somewhat fast, first of all close all the programes - then go to start - right click - explore - single click drive c - right click once - select find - in file name type *.tmp and press ok.  you will see the list of files with extensions tmp.  select this all list and delete the same.<br>  <br>  restart the pc and check the speed of computer.  <br>  <br>  i feel for internet to be fast, you have to go to better / more costlier internet connection than which now you have. for home use, 512 kpbs speed connection is more than enough.

While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

xMqgB2GDaa	If you actually knew about DHCP, you would know that DHCP applies to internal networks, not external, and that a DHCP address is what you see, but what an external site like Yahoo would see would be different (unless for some reason you use dial-up), aka your public IP. DHCP is given by a router, like one you could buy from the store. But a router is not an ISP. Yahoo only sees what your ISP provides you. <br>  <br>  This would only be effective if everyone used a cable modem, had static IP addresses, and never used routers or networking equipment.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Are we talking factors of the CPU itself or the entire system? Also... Performance at what? Performing calculations? Playing games?<br>  <br>  Total RAM is a big factor, since memory-intensive programs like Photoshop will swap to hard disk when specific operations require more RAM than is physically present.  This use of hard drive space as "virtual memory" has a HUGE impact on performance.<br>  <br>  RAM speed affects performance, but to a much smaller degree.  The difference between 667Mhz and 800Mhz or 1066 Mhz RAM is minimal compared to the difference between running with 2GB or 4Gb of RAM, because hard drive speeds are exponentially slower.  <br>  <br>  An operation performed with the slowest RAM but entirely in memory is much faster than using higher-speed RAM but being forced into waiting upon disk reads/writes.<br>  <br>  For gaming, the video card has the greatest impact of any component- far greater than the impact of the CPU.  Even the fastest i7 processor on the planet paired with a weak graphics card will yield lower framerates in first-person games than a $75 dual-core E5200 and a $120 graphics card.  No matter how fast the CPU is, once the graphics card can't process data any faster you've hit a performance bottleneck.  Only a faster graphics card will improve things in such a situation.<br>  <br>  On the CPU itself, the amount of L2 cache and specific core architecture  (Core 2 Duo, Single Core, Athlon X2, etc) are significant factors.|`|ebuxHnScaa	There are so many:<br>  <br>  CPU microarchitecture.<br>  L1/L2/L3 cache sizes.<br>  Front-side bus speed.<br>  Memory chip transfer speed and latency.<br>  Number of memory controller channels.<br>  Hard drive speed and latency.|`|Fm7HC610aa	I would say, RAM and Bus speed.

Netbeans is a little easier for beginners and it's made by Sun, the developers of the Java language.  When you start a new web project in Netbeans it will set up all the directories and a small sample JSP for you.  When you click "Run" it will deploy in the embedded Apache Tomcat server that Netbeans comes with, and the JSP page loads in your web browser.

yHI6rfeUaa	Since you provided absolutely no information on the equipment, network, or ISP service you currently have, no one can advise you with any specific information on what can be done.<br>  <br>  Here are some things to consider<br>  <br>  1.  The ISP speed is set by the ISP at a subscribed rate.  If you are in fact getting that subscribed rate at the modem, you are left with increasing the subscribed rate at a higher per month fee if there is something faster available to you.  To measure the speed at the modem, connect a pc directly to the modem, which disconnects all other users and your router, and then run speed tests using an internet web site that is set up to measure your speed.  If this measurement is at the subscribed rate, you can only change to a faster plan if such is available.<br>  <br>  2.  If you have a low end home grade router, its processor may be undersized.  To check this out, connect the router back into the circuit, disable the wireless feature (if you have wireless active), connect only one pc to the router via wired connection and measure speed again.  If the value measured is within +/- 5% of the speed measured without the router, the processor can handle the speed and router upgrade will not help.<br>  <br>  3.  If you have a wireless Local Area Network (LAN), and you have not properly secured it to include MAC validation and WPA or WPA2 encryption with a strong preshare key, it is time to do this.  Remember that the speed at the modem is allocated in roughly equal proportion to all users at any point in time.  Therefore if hackers are busy downloading major files they are hogging your bandwidth.  Strong security will stop this.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	if you've got too much mail in your inbox, or too many downloads, deleting some of those can help free up memory space & improve the speed of the internet.

Upload your video to the site, give them a few hours to process it, and then your video will be on their site. To upload you will of course have to register first, but there is not charge for any of this. After your video appears look for the box below or to the side that says "embed code" and copy that to your notepad<br>  <br>  Then, if you are on a blog, writing a web page with a HTML editor, or even sending an email that has ah HTML rich editor, just begin to type your page and when you get to where you want to "embed" the video, stop and switch the tab on your page writer to HTML, this is usually in the upper right, and there is usually a button that says HTML or edit HTML or something, or you may even have a new style button on your tool bar to simply "insert video"<br>  <br>  Then insert the code from your notepad into your page. Whenever anyone reads it with a web browser or email client it will show your movie playing along with whatever title and comments you added to the page<br>  <br>  P.S.

793IpAn1aa	** Update **<br>  Sounds like a 2GB memory module- it might be the wrong speed, too large, or maybe just not pressed all the way down into the slot.  Some types of RAM must be installed in pairs. It's also possible it got ruined by static, if you didn't ground yourself.<br>  <br>  Try a couple of things.  First, remove it and try starting the computer with no installed- how many times does it beep then? Still 2, or a different number?  Then try booting with original memory, make sure that still works.  If the computer works fine with the original memory, try putting the new memory in again.<br>  <br>  What is the model number of your Dell? Some motherboards can only accept 1Gb memory chips per slot.<br>  <br>  *****<br>  <br>  I assume the PNY is a video card? Which model? <br>  <br>  Check the power requirements of the card to verify your power supply is strong enough.   Then confirm that the power cable is connected to the new card.  <br>  <br>  It's also possible the card is simply defective and needs replacement.  As a test, remove it and try rebooting with the original integrated video.<br>  <br>  If that works, contact PNY customer support.|`|gNIuzscMaa	Contact dell or pny support.

91WSbbtmaa	Well, you have encountered the limitations of using a PC formatted drive on a Mac. Is there any reason you're not wanting to format it as a Mac drive?<br>  <br>  The normal reason for not doing this is because you want to share the drive with a PC. You haven't mentioned this situation and your question, but it's the only possibility I can think of.<br>  <br>  So the bottom line, at least as far as I can see, is that if you want to share the drive with a PC then you aren't going to be able to do files over 4 GB. If you don't want to share it with a PC, then just reformat it as a Mac OS extended volume.
YwPmwKblaa	If this is going to be used by Mac only I would recommend using the HFS+ file-system which is default in the Mac Disk utility.

QBwwJJi3aa	Computer speed is by ram memory available. A lot of speed is used by booting up programs not needed. Do the following to increase speed.<br>  <br>  Go to start then run and type in msconfig. Then ok.<br>  To control what boots up goto msconfig. There is a boot up tab check or uncheck the boxes, to disable or abel each item. Also because you disable an Item this does not prevent you from using anything you disable, it only prevents it from booting up when you start computer. If you want to use an Item you disable from booting up just click on it, and it will start. There are a few essentials you need when booting up, normally 4 or 5 plus virus and firewalls controls if you have them. I have an HP mine are PS2, REC GUARD, KBD, CCAPP. Just rember because when you don't boot it up it is still usable but you gain a lot of ram memory. Also you can call the manufacter and they will give you the esstials for booting up. So you understand KBD stands for key board PS2 stands for mouse. <br>  Hope this helps|`|GI27dKIkaa	It could be a number of reasons !<br>  <br>  If it's happening regularly, I'd say have a word with your provider - see if they can boost your speed from their end.<br>  <br>  If it's just occasionally, it could be the amount of internet traffic !|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Sounds like your BROWSER is not working very well.<br>  <br>  You can download and use as many browsers as you like.<br>  <br>  The FASTEST browser on the Internet is called OPERA and you can download and use it for FREE.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opera.com/download/</a><br>  <br>  Opera browser works at very high speeds.

It will do it by itself. Whether you transfer info or not. As soon as you click on your ext hard drive or thumb drive there it goes. Not only that but check this out. There are corrupt thumbdrive companies that are in cahoots with the anti virus people.What does that mean to you you ask??? Well the anti virus companies pay the thumbdrive makers to let them put a virus on there new thunbdrives. Then you purchase it plug it in and boom you have a virus. So now you have to pay the antivirus people money to remove it. Pretty sneaky huh?

GNxhkuXIaa	In most cases, you won't have to take the motherboard out.  There are a few larger coolers that use a backbrace that goes on the underside of the motherboard and is screwed through the motherboard and into the mounting holes on the CPU cooler, but these aren't very common.<br>  <br>  You will probably want to remove the processor and reapply new thermal grease before you install the new cooler, however.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Some have a backer plate & some don't... It all depends on the type of cooler & the socket type... For example the Intel socket 775 has 2 ways of mounting, 1 is with 4 push clips that snap in place in each corner. The second way is with a backer plate & 4 screws 1 at each corner to hold the heat sink in place... That is 2 different mounts for the same CPU, you just need to read the manufactures spec's, as to mounting...|`|I4TLCFf7aa	You should just be able to remove the old cooler and replace it with the new one.

Usually you can change the cooler without removing the mainboard.|`|WWxGAzYgaa	You can replace the heat sink block without removing the mother board. I would suggest that you remove the RAM only because it often gets in the way and you can possibly slip and damage it. That goes for the video card too if there is one. (Make a hole so you can work in there).<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to remove the processor. If you bought a good heat sink, it should already have a heat sink compound swatch on the contact surface, if not, then you will need to use some silicon heat sink compound. Use very little, just a thin film. Never glob it on like you were loading up your toothbrush. Radio shack sells it, also you might be able to get it at Best Buy for way too much money.<br>  <br>  This goes without saying, but just in case.... it is easiest to work in there if you lay the box down on it's side.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	most will go on without taking the board out.

Irdj2KAFaa	Here's the example from this webpage. :)<br>  <br>  <link rel="stylesheet" media="print" type="text/css" href="http://l.yimg.com/a/lib/ansr/sp14/... />|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="cssfile.css" /><br>  <br>  Replace cssfile.css with your style sheet file name.|`|0nYZHlWUaa	External Style Sheet<br>  <br>  An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to many pages. With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing one file. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag. The <link> tag goes inside the head section:<br>  <br>  <head><br>  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"<br>  href="mystyle.css" /><br>  </head><br>  <br>  The browser will read the style definitions from the file mystyle.css, and format the document according to it.<br>  <br>  An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file should not contain any html tags. Your style sheet should be saved with a .css extension. An example of a style sheet file is shown below:<br>  <br>  hr {color: sienna}<br>  p {margin-left: 20px}<br>  body {background-image: url("images/back40.gif")}<br>  <br>  Internal Style Sheet<br>  <br>  An internal style sheet should be used when a single document has a unique style. You define internal styles in the head section by using the <style> tag, like this:<br>  <br>  <head><br>  <style type="text/css"><br>  hr {color: sienna}<br>  p {margin-left: 20px}<br>  body {background-image: url("images/back40.gif")}<br>  </style><br>  </head><br>  <br>  The browser will now read the style definitions, and format the document according to it.<br>  <br>  Note: A browser normally ignores unknown tags. This means that an old browser that does not support styles, will ignore the <style> tag, but the content of the <style> tag will be displayed on the page. It is possible to prevent an old browser from displaying the content by hiding it in the HTML comment element: <br>  <br>  <head><br>  <style type="text/css"><br>  <!--<br>  hr {color: sienna}<br>  p {margin-left: 20px}<br>  body {background-image: url("images/back40.gif")}<br>  --><br>  </style><br>  </head><br>  <br>  Inline Styles<br>  <br>  An inline style loses many of the advantages of style sheets by mixing content with presentation. Use this method sparingly, such as when a style is to be applied to a single occurrence of an element.<br>  <br>  To use inline styles you use the style attribute in the relevant tag. The style attribute can contain any CSS property. The example shows how to change the color and the left margin of a paragraph:<br>  <br>  <p style="color: sienna; margin-left: 20px"><br>  This is a paragraph<br>  </p><br>  <br>  <br>  Multiple Style Sheets<br>  <br>  If some properties have been set for the same selector in different style sheets, the values will be inherited from the more specific style sheet. <br>  <br>  For example, an external style sheet has these properties for the h3 selector:<br>  <br>  h3 <br>  {<br>  color: red;<br>  text-align: left;<br>  font-size: 8pt<br>  }<br>  <br>  And an internal style sheet has these properties for the h3 selector:<br>  <br>  h3 <br>  {<br>  text-align: right; <br>  font-size: 20pt<br>  }<br>  <br>  If the page with the internal style sheet also links to the external style sheet the properties for h3 will be:<br>  <br>  color: red; <br>  text-align: right; <br>  font-size: 20pt<br>  <br>  The color is inherited from the external style sheet and the text-alignment and the font-size is replaced by the internal style sheet.

sCAvtfpXaa	I'll take a look in a short time (got to get back to work), but one thing stands out.<br>  You mentioned it can "only accept positive values".<br>  Have you noticed that the stock market is down about 40%+ since last year? That would signify that it is a negative value in and of itself, no?<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  I noticed that you figured out the "yearly_rate", but actually calculated it as the monthly compounded rate.<br>  Then, in your "add_interest()" function, you further divided the rate by 100, which would be inaccurate, since you would only be getting  1/1200th of the real rate added.<br>  <br>  Simply remove "yearly_rate" and replace it with "rate_in_percentage", and the numbers will look much more realistic.<br>  <br>  And also the variable "years" should start off at zero (0), not at 1. Until you add interest, it isn't the first year.

jeMNcPPYaa	Most browsers now come with a password cage, these are designed to allow you to save passwords without risk, they are not saved in cookies and not not in a place accessible by java code, plus they are stored with an encryption algorithm.<br>  <br>  However, you might sit at the computer for a year or more without problems using automatic logon to sites. Then the computer, or even just the browser, goes faulty. Now, what was that password you typed in a year ago?<br>  <br>  So it is much better to make yourself remember your password. Have more than one.<br>  <br>  One for general browsing, for favourite chat, your yahoo etc.<br>  Another password for extra security, such as with the online bank or paypal.<br>  Then one other that is used for sites that are new to you. You are trying them out. If you decide that you like the site and feel confident a week or so after joining, then change this password to your general password.<br>  <br>  Passwords scare people, they imagine that they may forget them. Making yourself type them in each time means that you are very unlikely to forget them.<br>  <br>  Examples of good passwords (remember these are case sensitive<br>  <br>  initials in lower case|a number significant to you|initials of a relative in upper case.<br>  <br>  So password one : rj1980DG<br>  Password for bank: rj0891DG<br>  Unsure sites: DG1980rj<br>  <br>  So really you are only remembering one password, for the others you only need to know the two rules.<br>  <br>  You can now create your own three, not an exact copy of the pattern above, use one that means something to you.

But the matter of fact is using the remember my password thing just eliminates the password altogether meaning that anything can be read by anyone. Also stealing the passwords from firefox would be easy as it is a standard system you could beat at home and it would work on any computer. Although saying that if your using the standard windows password that can just as easily be retrieved and bypassed, something as simple as using safe mode will allow you to bypass and remove passwords from accounts.

vvcaO1xgaa	Java supports using native code(i.e code written in other languages like C/C++) using JNI(Java native interface) interfacing. However JNI is cumbersome and makes your program bulky. Also, if you're using threads in Java using JNI can get a little tricky. In essence you're wrapping your native code inside java usable classes. Even internally java uses a lot of native code to provide a lot of functionality at the application level. You can find more information about JNI online. <br>  <br>  Another way of doing the same is by creating your own services in the native code and make them available through a server of some kind. You can use socket programming in Java to connect to your server and use your native code functionality. However I do feel that JNI is a lot more logical/easier way of doing it.|`|0e268d1d1e47e306487921fa572d09f7aa	Try this link....really.....is does talk about calling C runtime library functions from Java<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ddj.com/java/184405381" rel="nofollow">http://www.ddj.com/java/184405381</a>|`|4c770e93cae766d4352b51d99611c9c6aa	Here c program, come here c program....good c program!|`|sB38LHKRaa	check out for java native interface at java tutorials|`|875x505Maa	java script tutorials-<a href="http://aboutjavascript.info/" rel="nofollow">http://aboutjavascript.info/</a>
