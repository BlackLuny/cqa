h5NPYdgxaa	The problem is with the Yahoo games site.  This does happen occasionally.<br>  <br>  I'm having the same problems with Yahoo Dominoes and Yahoo Pool.<br>  <br>  There's not a problem with your computer, the problem is at the other end.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it will be fixed by tomorrow.|`|S7HENruLaa	i don't no ?files and cookies? passwords yes luck oh no luck no i don't logg in the yahoo games sites
suPD7c3gaa	First of all, Yahoo DOES NOT send spam... ever!!  Second, Yahoo! Briefcase IS closing down.  This is not spam, or a prank, or scam or anything else.  It is an official notice from Yahoo informing people one of their free services, Yahoo! Briefcase, is closing down as of March 30th.  If you weren't using Yahoo! Briefcase, then there's nothing you need to do or worry about.  Yahoo! Briefcase is (soon to be "was"), a file storage/sharing site available to all Yahoo! members.  I used it to store documents for years so I could access them from other computers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/briefcase/closing/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/briefca...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/briefcase/closing/eol01.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/briefca...</a>
RnB6D6ZYaa	Cut out the picture you like, and tape it onto your monitor in the appropriate place.
7u77AiBjaa	UPDATE: Just to drive home the point, only Yahoo! Answers staff members know when an update will happen IF there is a systemwide issue. The last set of delays lasted about 4 days. The delay before that lasted for two weeks for many people. Otherwise, images usually appear within minutes to 2 days.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Patience is necessary if you use the 360 image feature. <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment to the correct image. <br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. Although, you are not guaranteed a written response from staff. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	Some people recently reported the same problem. There are certain technical difficulties concerning displaying the 360 profile pictures on Yahoo! Answers. Many users were complaining about their pictures totally not showing up as their avatar. I think you need just to be patient and your picture will be displayed within some hours or a maximum of 2 days.

ABDstKRSaa	It does have bluetooth. I think its a pretty good fone, don't know about the sim card thing though. Generally unlocking fones costs aroung 10 - 15 pounds. The only trouble I'm having is getting music onto it, it wont seem to go onto the memory card. Hope I've helped :)

TcfbqVVKaa	Yes you can chat from yahoo mail. Firstly, make sure you're signed out of yahoo messenger(if you have it) then click "sign in to chat" at the top of the yahoo mail page, then it will sign you in and at the side where it displays your inbox, trash and all your folders, it will say for example "0 online". It will tell and list how many people are online and all you have to do is click the person's ID, and chat with them.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to sms from yahoo mail, but I hope the chat stuff helps!
suPD7c3gaa	Yahoo! Briefcase is another one of Yahoo's free services that was available to all Yahoo! members.  If you weren't using it to store/share files, then there's nothing you need to do or worry about.  It's not something we had to specifically sign up for.  It was just available if we wanted to use it.  I used it for years.

9gMQAWBNaa	My experiences with trolls is that they berate, abuse, upset, harass and treat others in a hateful fashion. They insult others and hurt them as much as possible, they are much like hate criminals who hide behind the anonymity of the internet. Striking out like poisonous snakes, but never taking responsibility for what they do, because they are cowards and so they hide.<br>  <br>  They are related to  the people who wrote poison pen letters in the nineteenth century as well as the ones who behind closed doors created malicious gossip and horrible rumours that harmed others.<br>  <br>  Trolls are against anyone that they come in contact with, often answer questions with swear words or abuse or deride people who ask and wonder and care about things. <br>  <br>  More often that not if you go to different areas of Yahoo such as the psychology section or social studies you will find them. Their intention is to insult and hurt as many people as they can while remaining unscathed themselves. They create fake avatars for themselves to hide behind so they can abandon them later if their abusive behaviour is discovered.  <br>  <br>  Trolls in books and comics and on the internet are evil, nasty little creatures who pass on diseases to those who come in contact with them. They create and maintain hatred and chaos wherever they go, somehow it makes them feel powerful in their own cowardly way.|`|AA10672842	My understanding it is posters who knowingly ask a controversial or inflammatory questions just to get everyone all worked up .They want to stir up trouble then move on to another question.They don't contribute anything to the site.Take care.|`|4KtPFzz5aa	It means anybody that posts questions, answers, avatars that are meant to be offensive or inflammatory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/ph/yahoo/answers/abuse/abuse-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/ph/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|AA10958272	Being a jerk, annoying people on Yahoo (for your own laughs & kicks).|`|ED4nlW4raa	Fishing for babes or guys.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	following a person around giving the same person thumbs down all the time I think if I'm wrong sorry|`|CCCWGJCHaa	a troll is like a shock-jock.<br>  they say stuff just to tic people off.
OTj8vfQzaa	Those who love Obama reported your 'hate' question and those who do not love Obama have yet to report your 'love' question. <br>  Questions are deleted when more than one reliable source reports them. It is automatic, I think. So, just wait, your Don't you just Love Obama question will probably get deleted too as well as this one.<br>  It's just the way things work. People get offended and just hit that report button and the 'robot' deletes your question.<br>  Try appealing it, you just might get the question back.<br>  Good luck.|`|kf554xePaa	They are a bunch of liberal facists that hate free speech.  I've had lots of questions & answers regarding that American hating devil deleted. <br>  You have no right to question the great savior of the left.

d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	Having problems with the new LAUNCHcast radio player. Check out our help page for information and troubleshooting steps.<br>  <br>  Q.      How will LAUNCHcast change as a result of the CBS Radio partnership?<br>  A.      After February 16, 2009, CBS Radio will power LAUNCHcast Radio.  All LAUNCHcast stations as well as a wide variety of local music, news, talk, and sports stations from CBS Radio will be available to Yahoo! Music users.<br>   <br>  Q.    How can a user access LAUNCHcast powered by CBS radio?<br>  A.    LAUNCHcast powered by CBS Radio will be available just as it is now, on the front page of Yahoo! Music.  For the first time, LAUNCHcast powered by CBS Radio will also be available on Firefox and Mac.  Individual Sports and News players will be available on the front page of those respective Yahoo! sites later this year.<br>  <br>  Q.    Is LAUNCHcast powered by CBS free?<br>  A.    Yes, all Yahoo! LAUNCHcast and CBS stations are free with no restrictions on how long you can listen.<br>  <br>  Q.    Are all the same Yahoo! programmed LAUNCHcast radio stations still available?<br>  A.    Yes, all of the Yahoo! pre-programmed radio stations are still available and can be easily found in the player.  However, the station line up is subject to change.<br>  <br>  Q.    What is happening with the personalized 'my station'?<br>  A.    The customized “my stations” in LAUNCHcast will be discontinued.  <br>  <br>  Q.    What is happening with Fan stations?<br>  A.    Yahoo! is working with CBS to provide a similar “Artist-based” radio experience that plays the artist you select and similar artists.  This feature may be released during a later phase of the partnership.<br>  <br>  Q.    What is happening with Mood stations?<br>  A.    The customized “Moods” in LAUNCHcast will be discontinued.<br>  <br>  Q.    Can you skip songs?<br>  A.    Yes, LAUNCHcast powered by CBS Radio honors 5 skips per hour.<br>  <br>  Q.    What is happening with LAUNCHcast Plus?<br>  A.    We are discontinuing the LAUNCHcast Plus service. All of the exclusive stations only available with a Plus subscription are now available to users for free. Additionally, a high bandwidth sound quality option will be available for free users as well. There will no longer be an option to listen to LAUNCHcast ad free.<br>  <br>  For an ad free music experience, we encourage users to check out our partner, Rhapsody. Rhapsody is a digital music service that lets you listen to whatever you want, wherever you are (even on Yahoo! Music) — without paying per track. And Rhapsody membership plans start at less than the cost of a CD a month, so you can listen to as much music as you want without limits.<br>  <br>  Q.    What should I do now if I am a LAUNCHcast Plus subscriber?<br>  A.    You do not need to do anything if you are currently a LAUNCHcast Plus subscriber.  You will have access to LAUNCHcast Plus until the service is terminated on February 12, 2009.  If you have time left on your LAUNCHcast Plus subscription when the service is closed, you will receive a pro rated refund for the balance remaining.<br>  <br>  Q.    Can you still listen to LAUNCHcast in Yahoo! Messenger?<br>  A.    We anticipate LAUNCHcast powered by CBS Radio will also be available in Yahoo! Messenger in February 2009.

Nothing changes with your email account.<br>  You don't have to do anything, since you aren't using the Briefcase program.

If you do a regular Google (NOT Google Images) search for "David Gandy photos", you would get a list of sites where those photos might be found.  You don't have to click on Google Images, or the Images link when you do the search.  Most search engines are going to give you a similar result.

Obviously you didn't do that---so you have nothing to worry about---no action is required by you.

Briefcase is online data storage that all Yahoo users have access to.  It is not a scam, they are discontinuing it, and if you use it you have to remove your data from it or it will be lost.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Yahoo allowed a way for their user to store stuff. The briefcase is basically that, you could store photos or other media files, you could store documents or basically anything online so you can have access the stuff from any machine. Maybe you had a big list of recipes and while at a friends they wanted to know how to made something, you hop on their machine login to your briefcase and BAM, you can just give them the recipe.<br>  <br>  The email is legit and they are doing away with these feature.|`|fYDX6Ugiaa	Sounds like a scam to me.

iraqmc7qaa	From your question, it seems your MUM has no idea what she is doing or how to use a computer - am I right? 'the only user' doesn't exist, the first user is the Administrator who should never be a user. This is a problem basically created by Microsoft - and after so many years of domination (remaining wholly unresponsible and unrepentant) people are slow to change and learn... Fortunately, Window XP is as secure as a laundry basket - so just do this:<br>  <br>  1 - Boot your system with the Windows XP Setup CD. A screen will come up to welcome you, then you'll have an option to accept the EULA agreement, etc - proceed as required.<br>  2 -When you get an option to install XP or "Repair your existing Windows XP installation". Choose to Repair by pressing “R” - It will then start the repair process by first copying files the files needed. In a few minutes, the setup will begin to restart your system and when it restarts remember NOT to press any key when it shows “Press any key to continue…”. Else setup will start from the beginning. Don’t press any key and setup will resume from where it stopped. It will start doing other tasks and will show a small progress bar with a few details in left hand corner.<br>  *** Look carefully at the details and when it shows “Installing Devices“, remember to press Shift key + F10 key in your keyboard. This will open up a Command Prompt window. Now type nusrmgr.cpl and press the Enter key. This opens up the “User Accounts” window which you normally get in the Control Panel.<br>  <br>  Now you can now easily reset any account's password. You can use this to take over anybody's computer as long as they didn't encrypt it.|`|CT3t80suaa	Try  going into the BIOS on startup and seeing if it'll allow you to reset the accounts/configurations/whole thing.|`|23qCtLvIaa	boot it into safe mode. Or go onto another user. Go to your start menu. go to run. type cmd into the run bar click ok.

Answers profile, so I can't confirm that you have one. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. In the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), show a red "x" in box or words, or display an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

As far as I know, if you write in there the VN will have it on it. I make an effort to write a reason that I am reporting someone- if you can't supply a reason, clearly you don't know what they've done wrong and are taking a stab in the dark in reporting and hoping they don't appeal or the VN is upheld if they do.<br>  <br>  There are several threads over on the suggestion board regarding this issue- you should check it out and maybe even make your own suggestion regarding VNs.|`|VM9KZ0CVaa	There is no real "person" at the other end of the line. It is all automated by computer. They get too many of them to sort them out, so they don't even bother. It helps to make your profile private and not allow any "fans"...who can look at your profile. Sometimes people can report questions for little or no reason and if enough of the "community" attacks a question or answer, then the system will ring up a "violation" automatically.<br>  <br>  If you press the issue for an "appeal", then they ignore you or send you an email saying that you will have to get an attorney to sue them in order to view their "private" records.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I thought I was the only one that was never told what I did wrong. It's like your parents randomly smacking you in the face and not telling you what you did.  The only one I ever received a reason for was when I purposely copied and pasted an answer and it said I was points gaming.|`|lXE75yQjaa	That is an excellent point. I have wondered the same thing and have the same problem. They used to give you a reason. I don't know why..but a good question.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	I think the only time they tell you why you are violating is when the communtiy reports you.

So wait till Monday once you have over fifty Best Answers in one category, and check your profile under your Avatar there should be a bright orange badge.<br>  <br>  So, here are how/rules you can become a TC:<br>  <br>  - They give out things on MONDAYS!<br>  - Get over fifty BA<br>  - Stick to up to three categories<br>  - Stay in one category<br>  - Make sure it is one you like<br>  - Don't post in Riddles & Jokes / Polls & Surveys<br>  - Stay out of opiniated questions (you may get reported)<br>  - Check over your facts<br>  - Maybe add a link or two that is helpful, and NOT spam?<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|suPD7c3gaa	Just keep answering a lot of questions in ONE category. Answer only quality questions with helpful, informative quality answers to give you a better chance at getting Best Answer for your answers. The exact formula isn't publicized, but it's rumored we need to answer approx. 50 questions in the one category in a 30-day period, and of those answers, get 10% best answers. You'd have to maintain that balance of Best Answers to total answers to keep the Top Contributor badge once you get it. You can be Top Contributor in up to 3 categories.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	It's a combination of moderately-high participation (2 or 3 answers per day is enough) in a single category along with a Best Answer rating of 10% or higher in that category, over a period of several weeks.<br>  <br>  At least we THINK that's how it's done ... no one knows for sure what the "magic TC formula" is.|`|yfi5iB7Zaa	You need to have about 20% best answers from your total number of answers.<br>  The top contributor is from a category....

Jokes and Riddles and Polls and Surveys don't have top contributors.  You can get them at any level from 2 up.  Every Monday they review accounts and update categories.  You can earn it and lose also.  If your percentage of best answer drops, they can take it away.

suPD7c3gaa	To pick a Best Answer from answers to your own questions:<br>  <br>  Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.

suPD7c3gaa	You mean from a phone?  Most cell phones allow for multiple recipients, but I highly doubt there's one that allows to send to hundreds.  If you mean email, Yahoo mail only allows us to send to 50 addresses in one mailing, and we can only do that twice in one day for a total of 100.  If you go that route, do remember to put ALL addresses in the bcc field.  No one should ever make other peoples' email addresses known to others.

oOly8Wj2aa	Try logging in in Safe Mode (press F8 during boot, right after you see the white-on-black text that says "Starting Windows...", then use the arrow keys and enter to select Safe Mode from the menu), and see if you can log in using this. While this isn't a permanent solution, it may allow you to log in and start working on solving the actual problem. If you can get in this way, try using the Control Panel to turn off Fast User Switching and the Welcome Screen (under "Change How Users Log On And Off", inside "User Management").<br>  <br>  Failing that, try Last Known Good configuration (same as Safe Mode). This will attempt to revert your computer's configuration to the way it was right before your last new driver installation, which could fix the problem: not likely, though!<br>  <br>  Worst case, you'll need professional help and perhaps a reinstall of Windows: sorry!

Often information contained in an RSS feed is syndicated on other sites which expands its reach.<br>  <br>  Website visitors love RSS because they choose which feeds they wish to subscribe to, if at any point they are unhapy with the content contained in the RSS feed they simply unsubscribe and no longer receive notification of feed updates. <br>  <br>  RSS is really a win, win for both subscribers and publishers. <br>  <br>  In order to get a better understanding of how RSS works download an RSS reader or use a web aggregator and subscribe to an RSS feed (they are usually indicated by a small orange icon).|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	It is basically a page of links that constantly get updated.

I am always bored on the week-ends and stuff. A guy needs something to do, right?|`|91YyhAllaa	Yep I never have lied in a question!
gGZz2EGyaa	I have been getting that all day, you begin to wonder is Yahoo trying to tell you something.  There have been so many glitches on Yahoo this week its been unbelievable, I really thought when they had the down time the other day that it would all be sorted out. You just have to keep trying or do what I did and logged out for a while. Its very annoying to say the least!
EZFmUYcSaa	It looks like someone with braces.|`|XLnboFslaa	no, it looks like a hamburger bun with eyes.
gGZz2EGyaa	Your violation has nothing to do with the lost of the TC badge, you may just have not been contributing as much as you have been in the particular section you TC for.  Just start picking up again and answering more questions etc and the badge will be back again.|`|VC5mEULTaa	the badge is based on your recent activity and best answer percentage. If your recent activity in that section drops enough, you;ll lose the badge(its easy t get back if you up your participation again). Your vio doesn't have anything to do with it.
AA11307940	The TC badge comes and goes according to how active we are in our categories, we need at least 10% Best Answers in a category to keep it. No one knows the exact formula, but the guess is 40-50 best answers a week to keep it. You wouldn't lose it for a violation, but many violations or 1 bad one and you would loose your account. So get back to answering and it will come back.

YBQvzEhGaa	I viewed your previous questions and it seems that a lot of your questions are over the heads of the average Y!A answerer.  I think the only thing you can do is find someone that has a common interest as you, add them as your contact, and then every question you ask will show up to them and they can star it and draw other people to it. Other than that there is no other way to make your questions stick out.  Good luck!|`|rBwaAiYRaa	People don't answer your questions because they're boring.  .|`|MPbB0ri1aa	There is no system in place to bump up your question.<br>  <br>  You can delete it and try posting it again. But I believe you will loose points by doing so. You will neither lose nor gain any points for choosing no best answer to your question.<br>  <br>  To increase the chances of quality answers, post your question in the category that is the closest to the subject of your question. There are people who kind of specialize in certain areas and will search back on one questions in the category of there interest for questions to answer. <br>  <br>  Make the question clear and to the point and add the details in the add details box. That way people can quickly see what your question is about.|`|VC5mEULTaa	Just looking at your Q it seems like you have problems getting a good number of answers. To start off, there is no way to 'bump' your question on yahoo unfortunately. Your question will go further and further back as more questions show up. If you ask in a very popular section, then your Q could be off the first page in 15 minutes which can make it difficult to get answers.<br>  <br>  If the no best answer option is selected and your question is deleted, you get your 5 points back(the answerers keep their two points for answering). If you manually delete your question yourself(by going under EDIT-the pencil icon and deleting it), you don't get your 5 points back, and again the answerers keep their points.<br>  <br>  You have a certain time period to choose a best answer yourself. The option will appear 4 hours after you ask your question and will end after four days. If you don't choose a best answer within that time, your question will go into voting. You can extend your question for a few more days, but if you don't choose a best answer(you won't get an email warning this time), your question will go into voting.|`|Btsctjydaa	Honestly? Your questions aren't sexy enough.

If you don't know how to resize a pic, don't worry, Yahoo will still show it in an appropriate size.<br>  <br>  Note: currently quite a few users are experiencing problems with their 360° avatars, sometimes it takes days until they show up.

But my name, Ariel, really means Lion Of God. If you don't like your name, you shouldn't change it. Your parents gave you that name. And that's also one thing nobody can change about you. <br>  But if you insist on people not calling you shell, ask them to call you ashley.  My parents, friends, and relatives call me aj, because ariel is my dad's name.
6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.<br>  <br>  For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.<br>  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.<br>  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts".<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not post a picture and ask if the person is pretty or to rate them. That is considered chatting and is a violation of the guidelines.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|1CABRATlaa	You need to use an image host.  I use Screen Dash.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to use a separate email program, such as Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, or Thunderbird, with Yahoo Mail you need POP3. It is free in the UK but in the US you must pay for Yahoo Mail Plus.  It is also required when you try to transfer the mail using smtp or pop3 to another online email.  When you do you can set the servers as follows:<br>  Incoming (pop3) - plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com (UK pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk)<br>  Outgoing (smtp) - plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com (UK smpt.mail.yahoo.co.uk)<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|MPbB0ri1aa	The exact formula is not known. But it does include answering so many questions in a particular category (except joke and polls). And getting so many best answers.
CoEVVkNhaa	Not really, I think people answer questions they know or think is worth answering.
cIZS6Wr2aa	I don't really understand your question.  Is yahoo posting the add-ons or are us users posting them?  I thought we posted them  under details in our questions.
szyUVMOlaa	downsides: trolls, having your qu.s and answers by the thought police for no apparent reason! good things: having loads of answers to the most obscure questions within minutes, community, laughing at stupid qu.s|`|SBkSOdrlaa	quick answers but not always right answer. sometimes stupid ads like the one on here.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	The good side is that most of the time you can get good answers to your questions. <br>  <br>  The downside is that if you say something people don't like they might start stalking every question you ask and make snide remarks about you and possible start e-mailing you constantly (see my profile for a link to the guy presently doing that to me)
jV2ih8DJaa	I wondered that too.  I have tried to get on about 4 hours; tried everything.

It has nothing to do with Yahoo mail.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?
Fu3wveYiaa	On the right side of your Yahoo mail screen click "Options" and then "Mail Options"<br>  <br>  Then, you will be asked to switch to the new Yahoo mail on the right hand side|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There are two versions of Yahoo Mail.<br>  One version is called "Yahoo Mail Classic".The other version is just called "Yahoo Mail" or "All-New Mail". The new version will only work on newer more powerful computers with high speed internet.<br>  <br>  To go from Classic to new click on the link in the upper right to "All-New Mail". You can also click on the "Upgrade to the All-New Yahoo! Mail" link to the right of the folder name in the reading window.  Also you can click on options > mail options and click on the button that says "The New Yahoo! Mail has arrived. Try it now."<br>  <br>  To go from New to Classic click on "Mail Classic" at the top of the screen.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?
x647LeB2aa	I suspect it is for the same reason that people copy pages and pages from the Wiki: they want the points but cannot be bothered to type out a concise answer themselves.<br>  <br>  Better than that are people who answer 'I don't know'.  (Correction: 'I dnt no') or make some random remarks about fictional Alien beings etc.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	It would suffice to give the answer they like a thumbs-up. <br>  <br>  Where does it say in the Community Guidelines that one may not call out another User's name in an ANSWER? I know it's not allowed to call out another user's name in a question.<br>  <br>  <br>  "We also consider questions that call out other users by name to be chatting. If the intent is to ask a follow-up question in response to someone else’s question and that person is not available via email or IM, post a new question that’s open to everyone in the community to answer – there might be someone else who’s better equipped to answer it."|`|suPD7c3gaa	Because they want their 2 points.  Unfortunately for them, when they give an answer like that, it's a violation and is often (and should be) reported.  It's actually more than one violation because another user name is mentioned... also now allowed.
8XS7xeiXaa	the propel doesn't have a signature option. the only way you can do it is if you save your signature in a template & write your message in front of it everytime.<br>  otherwise, there's no way.
oOly8Wj2aa	Yes! It can certainly be done - see some of the links below for people who've actually done it (or tried to do it) before, or have discussed the possibility.<br>  <br>  You'll need to use a ferry or the Eurotunnel, of course, to transport your car accross the English Channel. You'll also need to obtain visas for each country you're planning to travel through, including China, and these can sometimes be hard to acquire, especially in the troubled Middle East. Carry several spare cans of fuel and be ready with the tools and expertise to repair your own car, because you'll be doing some long drives and you may be "on your own" for maintenance for a lot of it, during what will be a long and challenging drive for both you and your vehicle.<br>  <br>  I heard a story about some Oxford students who did exactly this (with a ferry trip, of course) back in the interwar years, when much of the Middle East was still Persia. Apparently they ended up being shot at by local warlords quite often. You can't rule that out in some areas of the world even today.
j2C4riJlaa	Okay..is this for a hotmail/msn account?<br>  <br>  You should use your first and surnames for an E-Mail account!<br>  Otherwise you get bored and fed up with the ones you have made up then you end up chopping and changing between accounts which can be quite annoying!<br>  <br>  Goodluck :)|`|XojxC4xxaa	Here are my choices if I were you:<br>  <br>  (i) taylor.iceprincess@(email provider name here)<br>  <br>  (ii) taylor.happygolucky@(email provider name here)|`|jfYwwojLaa	Taylor.

Don't be so anxious for it though.  It's a waste of time, no points are involved, unless the answer that was chosen as Best Answers happens to have some thumbs up.  Then that person gets those points.  Thumbs down serves no purpose whatsoever... other than to needlessly upset people.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you can't  use it yet.

AA11307940	The Yahoo game server is down for maintenance and updates, they had a message on the front page of the game site saying how long it will take. I had this the other night.

Then when you end the activation, click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link in the upper right corner of that ending page or the 360 main page to enter the space.<br>  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, set up a completely new account by logging out of all Yahoo services. Then, go to any Yahoo sign-in page and clicking "Sign Up" on the lower right side (<a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> , is preferred). Go through that process, then try activating the 360 space for it using the instructions from the first paragraph. You can use only one Yahoo account at a time in Yahoo! Answers though.<br>  <br>  If none of this works, you may be out of luck for now. The Universal Profile System (i.e. the Yahoo! Profile - <a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) has begun and it will eventually replace 360. See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> for more details.|`|eRzrH8vTaa	you have to use an @hotmail.com or @live.com account for it to work, try that.<br>  hope i helped|`|7ub4BJmtaa	you might have used @hotmail or @live or @gmail or somthing like that. you have to use @yahoo for it to work. or mabey the servers are down again. hope this helped.|`|GJf8zzmOaa	Yahoo servers are down AGAIN..

Z9r8OIifaa	I think it must be yahoo, cuz I'm having the same problem, there is 4 other posts for the same question & no body can answer why yahoo games are down. IDK but that's just my 2 cents, I've been having problems every since this morning so must be yahoo or something.|`|pp7t4wTWaa	I've had the same problem all day. I know people have mentioned that's a problem on the Yahoo end, but the games I'm trying to get into do show people in them. So someone is getting in..........|`|3uenwbGgaa	I am too, it worked fine until today. I can't play pyramids or spades. I have cleaned my cookies, cleaned disc, etc etc. Nothing worked. Anyone able to fix this.|`|QskeN51qaa	I have been getting the same error when I try to log into spades.<br>  You would think Yahoo would post a notice on the home page for us poor lost fools...)|`|ucPTy1fTaa	I'm having trouble too out of the blue. Maybe there's a problem. :-(

Aside from that.<br>  <br>  'What tattoo design should I get?'<br>  'Am I pregnant?'<br>  'Don't you feel sorry for Jade Goody?'<br>  'Do you think I'm good looking?'<br>  'Wasn't Eastenders great tonight?'<br>  'Does he / she fancy me?'<br>  'Am I gay?'<br>  <br>  It's also really terrorising when someone asks the same question ten times in a row, you give a really good answer, and then they still ask the same question another ten times. <br>  <br>  And worst of all is anything that ends with '...best answer gets 10 points'.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Every one doesnot ask such questions ,they are a type of people who never cared about weight and now suddenly want weight loss .Do not worry about them,Do you agree that there are many good questions also,if no I can ask you many good questions|`|PK9TjQf4aa	The ones that are really terribly spelt and just generally dont make any real sense.|`|AA11835801	All of the questions where girls are like, "Guys:  Am I cute?

GUkAoezdaa	I have both YahooMail and Gmail accounts but hardly use the Yahoo one now as Gmail is superior in almost every respect that actually matters - speed and ease of use, clarity of layout, search facilities, filtering and labelling options, forwarding, etc.  Moreover, you get all that free with Gmail, whereas Yahoo will charge you for anything beyond its most basic features.<br>  <br>  A definite plus in Gmail is its automatic organisation of email threads into 'conversations' so that any replies to your emails are put in the same thread as your original message.  This is particularly useful if you take part in email-based discussion lists (such as Yahoo Groups) and updates from message board or forum exchanges.<br>  <br>  The person who said there was less storage with a Gmail account is totally wrong.  I've got several hundred thousand emails stored in my Gmail account and they only take up 30% of the space I'm allowed (which also increases regularly, by the way).  To get that sort of storage space in YahooMail, you have to pay a premium fee; with Gmail it costs absolutely nothing.  What's more, it's very easy to search through your email archive in Gmail and find old emails according to authors, subject or whatever.|`|iW9hKKp5aa	i think g-mail and yahoo are practically the same. but yahoo has more things you can do with your e-mail, like the anwsers and stuff like that. on bioth you can have you own personalized page. and its yahoo.com is more interesting. with like news and stuff...|`|015ae9b63882e617a5fe7b1d734490e1aa	Not sure if this is true anymore, but last I knew Gmail had a cap on their space limit.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is no benefit. Gmail has many features for free than Yahoo wants $19.99 a year for. They have automatic forwarding and pop3 mail. I use Gmail as my general purpose email and access it with Thunderbird. My ISP account is for personal mail and Yahoo is for spam.<br>  <br>  Note that even through Yahoo may have unlimited space there is no backup on your computer. If through a glitch they lose it there is no recovery. With Gmail and a separate email program the mail is on your computer and you can back it up any way you wish.<br>  <br>  BTW: I use Gmail as my default account for Yahoo. They send all notices there and even Y!A mail goes there.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|8cJkD6aYaa	None. use Gmail.
lcj1AKt1aa	Don't listen to them they are only jealous.  Just try to prove to them that you are better than them and let them eat their words. Play to the best of your ability.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Yahoo Briefcase was a site to store any text documents as a backup. If you have never gone to <a href="http://briefcase.yahoo.com">http://briefcase.yahoo.com</a> and uploaded something you have nothing to worry about. It has nothing to do with Yahoo mail.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?
e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	How to fight spam and scams:<br>  <br>  #1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.<br>  <br>  You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.<br>  <br>  Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/spamguard1.html">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a><br>  <br>  #2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.<br>  <br>  Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously. <br>  <br>  When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...</a><br>  <br>  #3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...<br>  <br>  Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.<br>  <br>  Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.<br>  <br>  MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.<br>  <br>  Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mailwasher.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mailwasher.net/</a>|`|44vgFcKcaa	Unfortunately, you can not stop. However, you can try to avoid it.<br>  First, make sure you do not click on any E-mail from someone you do not know. Clicking on spam causes them to send more and more of it to you. Then mark them as spam ans that should block those addresses, then use your spam filter and also block some addresses.<br>  Look for the 'Options' link at upper right corner of mail screen and click on it.<br>  Options /mail options / blocked addresses<br>  Enter the E-mail address you wish blocked and click on 'add block'<br>  you will never get mail from that address again
yfH5uLGgaa	You will get the option to open it...or check your default folder for incoming files.<br>  If you still having problems, switch back to the Classic Mail.
