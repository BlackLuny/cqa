20090226153523AAVhNZG	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Is this my computer or my internet service?	For the last day or so when I'm trying to use the internet (I have cable internet) every so often it goes out and I get this little thing in the bottom right hand corner saying something about my connection and searching for address or something. I'm really sorry that is a really lame explanation, I tried to write down what it said but didn't get a chance to. Then I run this windows diagnostic thing and at first it told me to check my cables and try again. Well soon after it was working fine again and I never got a chance to check any tables. So anyhow it's been doing this on and off and it's so annoying. Any ideas of what's going on? I realize this is a horrible explanation but I thought maybe someone might know what I was talking about! Next time it happens I'll be sure to write it down and edit my question with more info.

I have a PHP backend already written to accept the form data and pop it into a database, but this requires the names to be the same, so PHP can recognize the data in an array.  Input IDs can be set to whatever, but I haven't had any luck with interHTML or DOM tutorials online.  I was able to make two functions to copy and delete the rows, but could never get the adding/subtracting to work right.  Any thoughts?  Only the request fields need to be summed.

My dad gave me his 450w to use while I wait for my 350w to ship (ordered case+psu, case came, no psu, mailed company, psu will ship), but I may just stick with the 450w.      But one thing really worried me about it. The main 24pin connector for the motherboard seems to be missing a wire+pin (look at the picture so you have an idea which one is missing), and it looks intentional, but it makes me ask if this was designed for a specific ATX motherboard. I just want to be safe about this and not burn my new motherboard.

20090226180920AATiHIz	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	New computer issues, I think it is ram issues?	Okay, this is probally my 20th computer that I have built for various reasons (friends, work, personal, etc). Its meant to be a cheap little HTCP with a custom made box (by me).      Basically I cut it on, fans on cpu, GC kick in, PSU without a problem. Monitor is blank and HDD is not spinning and keyboard has no lights. So I figure its the ram, I pop it out, pop it in my other desktop and that computer will just cut on, and restart constantly, I pop it out and its fine again. I try some of the PC8500 from my current desktop and that new comp does the same.      It has a 300gig IDE seagate HDD (verified it works in other machines).   650watt Power Supply (verified it works and tried others).   GA-G31M-ES2L Motherboard (First time used, brand new from new egg, it supports up to DDR2 800 ram)   E5200 cpu (First time used, brand new from new egg).   RAM DDR2 PC8500 (yes I realized after I ordered that it was a higher level ram, but I know allot of ram can auto downgrade, yet I figured if it didn't so what? only 20 bucks and I can up my desktop to 12gigs :p ) ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...       So I assume the following (basically I am asking if you think I am right or wrong or if I may have missed something):      A: The ram is bad for obvious reasons.   B: The ram in my desktop will not downgrade to DDR2 800 ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    C: Do you think I missed anything?

20090226184636AAzN4jf	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How can I track registry reads and writes?	I am working on making all of my applications portable so that I can use my software wherever I go (school mostly).  Some programs have easy to find registry entries, and these are quite easy to make portable usually.  The problem I am having is that some programs seem to access registry entries all over the place, and it is hard to find out what all of their dependencies are.      Is there some way that I can find out all of the registry entries that a program accesses?  The ideal would be a piece of software that runs in the background and logs which programs are accessing the registry, and what they are accessing.  I don't know if such software exists, but are there other ways to accomplish this?

I recently got an HDTV with a PC input and I would like to use it as a monitor for my PC. No problem, right? My PC has a video card that supports dual monitors. So what's my problem? I currently use two monitors on my PC setup and I would like to be able to switch between Monitor #2 and my TV from time to time.       In other words, sometimes I want to use my dual-monitors as they are at my desk, and sometimes I want to use my TV as the one-and-only monitor from my recliner. Is there a simple solution to switch between Monitor #2 and the TV without having to reach behind the PC and switch out the cables?

If I have hardware acceleration on anything but the lowest setting, very frequently while on the internet the display will become distorted and the system will lock up.  If I want to watch a dvd I then need to readjust the acceleration settings or it wont play. Can I get around having to manually change the settings.  Im also using lowest refresh rate.      I have the latest driver for my video card and the problem still persists.
20090225120922AAwX2cd	Computers & Internet;Software	Remove a program on Vista that isn't on the uninstall list?	How do you uninstall a program in Vista, if the program doesn't appear in the list of programs on the "Uninstall or change a program" panel?       See below for the details of my question.      ======================================...      I was trying to install the CyberLink program PowerDirect Ultra, and installation crashed. I tried again, and it detected the old installation, tried to uninstall, and then failed, with an error message "Error reading setup initialization file."      I tried to uninstall the program by going to Vista's "Uninstall or change program" panel, but the PowerDirector program is not listed.       I do have a CyberLink PowerDirector icon on my desktop, and the program does open when I try to click on it. However, I would still like to uninstall the program, and re-install, because it seems like the current installation is faulty.      I tried to get an answer from CyberLink customer support, but have not been able to get a useful response.

20090226181944AATvvGx	Computers & Internet;Software	Internet Explorer on Vista just had a major slowdown?	A couple hours ago my internet explorer was working perfectly. I clicked the icon, program popped up immediately, home page loaded in less then a second. A few minutes ago, I clicked the IE icon, program popped up.......waited....waited...waited...14 seconds later the home page suddenly loaded just as quick as always. I rebooted, same 14 seconds delay. I cleared the cache, temp files, history, same 14 second delay.       I hit the Internet Explorer 64 bit version, loads instantly, home page up in less than a second. Problem is, not all pages support 64 bit browsers. Anything with flash, for instance, since flash isn't supported on 64 bit browsers.      The delay is only on the initial load, and the computer doesn't seem to be doing anything during those 14 seconds... Why did it suddenly start doing this? 2 years ago someone asked a similar question, they suggested repairing IE... is it corrupted? How can I repair it on vista?      Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated :-D

20090226184403AAJzM51	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Which kind of laptop would you recommend PC or Mac?	I purchased an HP Pavilion dv2000 from Best Buy about a year and a half ago for college, and it has given me a ton of problems.  By the end of the first year, the battery would no longer hold charge at all, the AC power cord was shot, and the wireless card would only turn on half of the time.  Finally, the last straw came when I tried to turn it on using my girlfriend's AC power cord, and now only the lights come on and the monitor doesn't.  Since I was an idiot (and a poor college student) and didn't purchase an extended warranty plan, any repairs that would need to be made would come out of my pocket.      So now, getting to my point, the terrible experience I had with my HP has turned me off somewhat to PC laptops in general, and I have heard VERY many success stories from college friends who have owned Macbooks.  Excluding things like RAM and Hard Drive space, which type of laptop would you recommend and why?  If you recommend a PC laptop, what brand would you suggest and why?

Otherwise, I would be in so much trouble.   Today, I don't know how long ago, she decided to post something about them onto my wall. Like she couldn't text me.   I deleted it as soon as I could get onto my dad's laptop [i saw it on my ipod first], but it was still showing up in the news feed. So I did a search and found stuff about how to make it so things won't show up...I did that, and now it looks like it's gone...but I'm rather paranoid, so can it be sure that none of these three guys are still able to see it on there?      Thankss.      Umm, if that was confusing, the main question was   If I deleted something off of my wall, and after it was posted I made it so I didn't put stories on the news feed, can anyone still see the old wall post there?      Ughh. that was probably even more confusing.

20090226183730AAYiPLm	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Has anyone ever had any problems with internet connections on their laptop? Im having several problems.?	I recently bought an HP Pavilion laptop and a Netgear wireless router.  I have everything set up, and I am able to connect to the internet and browse web pages, but something just doesn't seem right with my connection.  For instance, I installed Microsoft Office 2007 onto my laptop, and now whenever I open it, it asks me if I would like to register it through the internet.  When I click OK, it comes back and says something about a communication error, and that it cant connect to the internet.  Another problem is that I downloaded LimeWire music sharing, and whenever I try and open that, it tells me that there is something wrong with my internet connection.  It also says that I am behind a firewall and do not accept firewall transfers.  I have tried turning the firewall off, and also allowed LimeWire to get through the firewall, and that hasn't worked.  Im also getting these same messages whenever I try and install certain windows and security updates.  I tried contacting HP and seeing if they could help me through the problem, but they didn't accomplish anything.  Something just doesn't seem right.  Like I said, I can open internet explorer and browse google, yahoo, etc.  But it seems that any other application that needs an internet connection isn't communicating properly, or something.  I have tried uninstalling and re-installing everything, I changed the settings on my router several times, and nothing has worked.  I think it has something to do with the settings I have on this laptop.  I was wondering if anyone knows what might be causing this, and could give me some tips on how to make it work.  Its been really frustrating, and I am out of ideas.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

20090226174258AAKHqrJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why won't my computer start with new ram?	I bought some new ram for my dell dimension 2400 desktop. It had 512MB and I bought 2 sticks for it 1GB each. The system didn't start and just beeped when I tried to start with them in. I tried putting only one in and having the old one in too and it did the same thing. The new 1GB ram is PC 3200 400mhz. The old ram is PC2700 333mhz. I figured it was the wrong ram and bought another 512MB stick of PC2700 333mhz ram and it won't work with that in it either which is weird because that's the specs of the old ram that was in there. I believe the two 512MB ram sticks are from the same manufacturer too.

I noticed that the clock speed on my laptop is reading 598 MHz. I have my Power Settings set to Max Performance. It's also reading 100% CPU Utilization. It's a Dell Inspiron 600m with a Mobile Intel Pentium M 755, 2000MHz.      I'm using Everest to monitor settings. Temp averages around 56C/133F which I know is a little high, but I don't think that's it. (Keep in mind the computer is under full load-even when idling because of the decreased clock speed).      What do I need to do to fix this, or is my computer just on its last leg? If you need additional specs, I can provide them.

20090226191116AAZkRLn	Computers & Internet;Software	Would there be any reason why my Microsoft word does not save my documents?	I do not know why my documents are not saving.  I download a worksheet document from online, for my online college class, and fill in what needs to be filled in.  After that I save it, or at least try to save it.  I go up to the little circle thing on the top left, push save, name the doc, and there we go.  But when I go back in to my folder to open the saved doc; IT IS NOT THERE. I am not that stupid when it comes to computers, everyone knows how to save a document. But I need some help with this.  It does not make sense. Also if I start a brand new doc it saves fine.   Does anyone have any suggestions?      I also think that my Microsoft "word" and "works" might be conflicting some how ,because for the longest time I used Works....maybe I dont know I am just thinking out loud

Here's a code i'm using:   body{ height:100%; margin:0; font-family:tahoma, arial;background-image:url(headerdeal.jp... background-position:center top; background-repeat:no-repeat; background-color:#000000}      the height of the entire page is 100% as shown, the background image shows up at the top of the page as the code states..      though, I can't make the width of the background image 100%..      so since the width of the image is larger than the resolution of my computer.. it extends past the screen.   and on some other computers.. the image's width is smaller than the computers width resolution.. so it doesn't stretch to fit the full screen.      how can i change the width of the stupid image?      i've tried everything really.. and i can code css like i'm reading a book.. so this is highly aggrivating.
