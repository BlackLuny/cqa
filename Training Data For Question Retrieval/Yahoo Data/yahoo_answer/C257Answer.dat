jxqNTr9Iaa	I think maybe Noel and Liam had the same book as you at one time or whoever wrote you're book was a fan ""
JyxNA1o0aa	Sure....|`|Al9wADtvaa	no...|`|tyCnjhXCaa	... to each his own... whatever floats your boat...|`|UD93qolxaa	No, I think it's not cool.|`|9a0b066a5b20fa93b4016e498d257747aa	Not really, no|`|9579027f870afff9383cd077db602669aa	Not only NO, but H3LL NO!!|`|BfdMSoz9aa	Cool is a relative term. If you enjoy the music for its composition and lyrical content then its cool to you and that's really what matters. The opinions of people on the internet and in daily life shouldn't matter, its the music that should matter. If you listen to those bands to be cool, then people may presume you want to be cool and don't actually like the music.    So if you do like the music, continue to enjoy it and don't worry about what other people think. Personally, I don't like that type of music, but I think its cool if you're coming by it honestly and as I said, liking and appreciating the music for what it is, not the social status value.|`|6jNBKvQGaa	weak sauce|`|fvmGua4maa	Yes.     If you like it, then it has served its purpose, ergo it becomes cool.     However, I'd recommend broadening your perspectives so you can fully judge what's the coolest for you. Might I suggest The Ark?    (by the by, I do kind of love Lady Gaga)|`|Jbo4k2cuaa	Kinda  I realy like paramore  but i "sorry" HATE the other two  Crush Crush Crush is a great song  Misery Buisness is even better  =)|`|i5tfFDIZaa	in my opinion, no... but thats just my personal opinion... I'm not going to judge you, if you like that kind of music, then thats all that matters|`|KaNVTodRaa	not imo.|`|H2snnvl6aa	no you have poor taste in music, all those people you listed have no talent and will be wiped of the radio station as soon as those corporate mainstream zombies get bored but, hey it's your opinion everyone's is different|`|1vCoaf08aa	No, sorry honey.|`|3dpIt3PIaa	Um... NO|`|pVTevFJgaa	Well, it depends on what you mean by "cool"...    In my definition, it isn't. But if it is to YOU, then listen to whatever YOU like.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	No. Just corporate trash.|`|aBqJhdufaa	No, not really, but it doesn't matter if it's cool or popular. Good q.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	ima go with NO on the cool music thing.    but the real question is, why do you care what we think? do YOU think you listen to cool music?? well you're the only one that matters so if you do....then you do! so be happy.|`|wfZTAD29aa	no|`|ebxwADDcaa	no.       but to be honest, listen to whatever you want to. if you dont listen to certain music because you are afraid of what they will think of you, you are a loser.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	no.     well actually tegan and sara are good but the rest sucks imo.|`|z1gUsqzHaa	Selena Gomez and Lady GaGa suuuuuuck.|`|4QD8FvkSaa	umm its good exept for selena gomez if ur over 13 then yea dnt listen to her but other than that ur good here r some suggestions  -linkin park  -coldplay  -kanye west  -akon  -anberlin  -beyonce  -danity kane  -fort minor  -timbaland|`|cf5e93c300c779cb17b4db0817907ee2aa	Trendy sucks. sorry to say.|`|m4SIA4yTaa	Your music SUCKS BALLS!!!
M5I56DKZaa	i love the shins!!   its just a mellow song, people confuse that for sad i guess
eVCpaKVIaa	YES YES YES!  ive never really cared for her music i always thought she had an ok voice.  shes kinda like lil wayne.   theyre both alright artists but everyone makes them seem better than they really are.  plus i think some people (guys) just like her because of her looks.  because honestly, "sasha fierce"(lol wtf?) makes music just like all the other female hiphop/r&b artists now-a-days|`|TCECDZxxaa	umm NO! she is so talented and beautiful|`|XJWeuLPoaa	kinda lol she has a good voice but sometimes she just over does a song! its annoying|`|Qi7U5RSfaa	yes. She left her old group and never looked back. good friend she is.|`|z3yVbIutaa	I dont think Beyonce is overrated.  Shes a great performer, a good singer and dancer, and shes pretty.  Single ladies is getting played out though.|`|dYYyBkBWaa	Yes.. she isnt that hot without make up.... she looks like shes atleast 35-40 a lil too old for me...|`|5AcSFVLSaa	NOOO!! she is Awesome|`|qqHx4KmMaa	Oh I think she definitely is, she is pretty and has a good voice, but so do many other artists out there. She doesn't write her own songs, and other singers do actually have a better voice. I think it is her looks that puts her ahead so far and there is so much respect for her in the business that she is just put into that higher league.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Actually, of all the women I've slept with...    She was one of the best...    (Don't much care for that kind of music though...I'm more a hard rock dude than anything else...)|`|XSa8fgNIaa	No shes awesome.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	No, I like her. The dance/song she did with Justin and Andy on SNL was hillarious.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	I dont think shes overrated, she got the look, her voice got a big range, she can dance.
YNuyXl1waa	Two immediately come to mind from the time period I think you're from:    -"Cadillacs and Dinosaurs", based on the cult comic book "Xenozoic Tales" which two adventurers travel a world where modern man (and its technology) and dinosaurs co-exist.    -"Cro", an animated Saturday morning series from Sesame Street's creators where a caveman and his dinosaur pet get transported into the present day and learns about science and math subjects.|`|2zw75LWfaa	its called the dinousaurs i bought the first 2 seasons at wal mart and they have i think 2 more or something you can probably find it on amazon its like got a moma and a brother sister and dad and the boy was named robby and the baby used to hit the dad with a pan and say not the mama i love that show used to watch it all the time .|`|4e0bf4c2aa3815167814a54f67eaca29aa	The only one I can think of is Extreme Dinosaurs    Edit: I just asked my niece and she said there was a "Land Before Time" Tv series also that aired on the Cartoon Network. Could you be talking about that?

ZyGyDLsDaa	Envy (2004)  IMDb synopsis:  Ben Stiller and Jack Black star as Tim and Nick, best friends, neighbors and co-workers, whose equal footing is suddenly tripped up when one of Nick's harebrained get-rich-quick schemes actually succeeds: Vapoorizer, a spray that literally makes dog poop or any other kind for that matter, evaporate into thin air~to where exactly is anyone's guess. Tim, who had scoffed at Nick's idea and passed on an opportunity to get in on the deal, can only watch as Nick's fortune and Tim's own envy grow to equally outrageous proportions. When the flames of jealousy are fanned by an oddball drifter (Christopher Walken) who imposes himself into the situation, Tim's life careens wildly out of control, taking Nick's with it. // Also in the cast are Rachel Weisz and Amy Poehler.  Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2QiYeAxb...|`|PumYhJSvaa	It is definitely Envy. I wish it would have been much better, but unfortunately is was horrid.|`|ZZoLSws7aa	Envy

uUzbqGh5aa	I don't think Phyllis will/should give up her fight to keep her marriage, but if things don't work out, she should just stay by herself with Summer and let Nick and Jack see that she can be a successful woman without whining to any of them!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i wouldn't doubt it or she will sleep with him to get back at nick for sleeping with sharon. phyllis and jack though have never had a steady relationship, but they are just alike|`|LkTcLWTOaa	as long as she doesn't end up with nick, i'll be happy. i can't stand her|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I think Jack and Phyllis should reunite    After watching yesterdays scenes, it makes me miss them together. They still have tons of chemistry and are alike in alot of ways. I think they make a better match then Jack&Sharon and Nick&Phyllis in my opinion.  so yes but I don't think it will be for a while, Nick still has to tell some how that Summer is Jacks, so I guess Nick will be like Brad was to Abby, dad and dad see how they repeat storylines.|`|msUIsv8maa	Phyllis& Jack make a better couple there more a like|`|LO3BMobRaa	She should, they are made for each other.|`|a7xUvhqpaa	I just wish Phyllis would get her sh*t together!!!|`|PcLfDSiraa	That would be great!!!

It will be fun to watch if this is true.|`|Xc02z608aa	No.  A new actress has been signed onto Y&R as Jack's new love interest.  Stacey Haduik(SP?)  She was on Heroes.|`|e99ea32489fc5dbc539f321016b1f8f7aa	Good possibility! I don't think she'll ever really trust Nick again.|`|3e607f71b77ac0f032137f72cc164e19aa	Yes , I do  I still wonder about that envelope when they were determining the dna of her baby girl. Was it jack's or nick /|`|30r4coInaa	If you asked me before the hospital scenes I would have said no, but watching them made me remember their chemistry.  I wouldn't mind Phyllis and Jack back together, but I fear it would be like watching reruns.  I think they're bringing on a new love interest for Jack, so we probably won't see a reunion there anytime soon.
IDH78lyAaa	Aries do love easily and impulsively, but staying in love is entirely another story.  He may hurt you somewhere along the line, and for a Pisces, with delicate feelings you will probably take it hard!  My advice is to take your time, and don't give in to your sensuality; better yet stay friends for a while, until you decide that he is indeed 'the one'.  They love a good challenge, and a hard-to-get sort of girls, but once the thrill is over, they tend to look elsewhere.  I rest my case!|`|of3jiuDiaa	He probably does mean it, but is also probably very impulsive and might jump in fast while the feelings are strong, but not hold out as long.
u86NV1Enaa	Lots and lots of differences but, among the many traditions, customs, foods, etc, the most important to me is How They came about.  -New Zealand is the fruit of Polynesians, Asians, and Europeans settlements. Today, they have "Two" Official Languages: English and Maori.  -Australia was occupied by Great Britain from the beginning. It was settled with British prisoners, meaning those braking the law and jailed for. Australia then, became an enormous jail for the British. The Official language is English, but there's also many dialects and Aborigines' languages spoken by the natives.|`|u8HczDCRaa	australians taste like chicken.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Kiwis|`|myhR1BpMaa	There different countries|`|Ii7vzF65aa	Two different places.|`|9kLiiDzVaa	Australians are more likely to be rednecks|`|nXUV9lH1aa	australians are obviously hotter.|`|rkdsrfGdaa	who cares?|`|1JglzZTjaa	um Australians are hot and have awesome accents duh!! and i dont know like anything about New Zealanders|`|wj4e6SeLaa	Two different countries, customs, cultures.|`|zczneZ7baa	idfk..ask one...|`|FrMR6TnWaa	fdggfg|`|YTLePvkVaa	The accents.

Yeah, I feel your pain..|`|bFrvcJGOaa	yuupp  if there cute ill let it goo...|`|4yaZE0Rpaa	yea.. :)  it hurts to tell people that were not though. :(|`|UP2WzIISaa	yer  it is really annoying|`|tkxMBtOHaa	ya it really sux! sometimes i dont want to hang out with him just because of that factor!|`|rRO3x9hZaa	I've had it happen to me before...|`|Nw0cYY8Taa	yea my best friend who is like a brother to me is always with me  and i hear some guys back off talking to me because they think  he is my boyfriend|`|WxSQA1ZKaa	yes! so often! we usually just laugh about it though.|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	yes.. i v this very close female fri.. and we used to hang out together.. actually not only hanging out.. we did call each other at nights and talked for like an hour or 2.. and also other stuff.. and every time.. when someone ask me ..whether we r  couple.. we only answer no..   it's not so annoying for me..actually..|`|60GmMBr7aa	YES its so annoying just because your hanging out with someone doesnt mean your going out it make me sick! :P|`|bbx4tCl0aa	It happened to me once then her boyfriend thought that we were secretly dating, i was an awkward situation for us both|`|91xbj2XMaa	yeah and when u get defensive they think your hinding some thing|`|txhkQRD9aa	haha yeah its so annoyng!  sometimes it makes you not even wanna hangout with that person as much.  once i went to a concert with this guy and evryone said aww he must be taking her for valentines day what a good boyfriend.  i wanted to diee haha|`|U7kJPlciaa	OMG YES!!!! Me and my friend.....well....lets call him Steve.... are always hanging out and talking and everyone thinks we are "together" or something.....ugh its so stupid! and it is very annoying!|`|9ZQcQNiiaa	yea...n my other friends keep saying...u 2 look lyk a couple but were just close friends...just want them 2 shut up!...rele annoying|`|gtaOUlg8aa	i havent.  but i hope so. hahaha.lol.|`|zccL7tBmaa	yep. onetime i went to the movies with a friend.  all our other friends didnt show so it was just me and him.   and then another time i was at a dance and i was dancing with my gay best friend raymond and someone told my mom that i had a secret boyfriend who i met up with at the dance.  that really sucked especially since i got a 2 hour interrogation by my parents.  it isnt as bad as my friend though- her and the guy in my first story(she was one of the ones who bailed) where in the hospital visiting his grandmother right ater one of our choir concerts.  They were in our choir uniforms (tux and floor length black dress).  The chapel happened to be on that floor and one of the nurses thought they were getting married. i dont know why since she was in an ugly black dress but hey. at least it wasn't me.  his gma is convinced to this day that they will eventually marry. it is quite funny.|`|GXM74MGPaa	doesnt really matter, does it?

They are extremely intelligent creatures. They are stereotypically wise and they also look a lot better than squirrels. I also believe the Owl would be able to protect me better. What's the squirrel gonna do.... throw acorns at an attacking predator.|`|ajcSwpVJaa	squirrels, cuz they are cute and can kick butt gathering food.  owls are just creepy sittin there turnin their head and lookin to make a kill on a rodent|`|3SWe11Knaa	Owls.

egQGq600aa	apparently this movie was highly exaggerated: even the real billy hayes admitted that things weren't that bad in his tenure at prison.  also, the way he actually got out of the jail differs from the movie account.  and if i'm not mistaken, oliver stone even apologized for portraying the turks so negatively.  and to top it off, the actors portraying the turks were greek and armenian!|`|cumhOqjXaa	ooopss...  lol    I thought u meant the Polar Express!  XD|`|TAIlyvgyaa	I think it's ridiculous to say that the 'politics' in a movie, especially a movie of actual events, make a movie bad, it's not even worth arguing with such a viewpoint.    I thought Midnight Express was a fabulous film for many reasons, lots of them nothing to do with the politics.    Some people would prefer it if the whole world just watched light hearted romantic comedy films and had nothing to say about them other than 'awesome'.      For those of us who like to think about what we watch, to choose to agree with a film's point of view or not agree with it, I say, watch ALL the films narrow minded reviewers say are too political.|`|mgiZ0bJ1aa	watch the pineapple express  its way better|`|nYK76GJpaa	really good movie seen it a while ago when it came out and bought it. This movie just shows you the messed up s.... that still goes on|`|DuSFKygEaa	I saw it when it came out.  Scary to say the least.      Never, ever get thrown into a Turkish prison.

hFSg8sGOaa	GEORGE W. BUSH  We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.    AL GORE  I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the chicken crossing the road represented the application of these two different functions of government in a new, reinvented way designed to bring   greater services to the American people.    RALPH NADER  The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV.    PAT BUCHANAN  To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.    RUSH LIMBAUGH  I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet someone out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with   crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars, and when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build roads for chickens to cross.    MARTHA STEWART  No one called to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the farmer's market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.    JERRY FALWELL  Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the "other side." That's what they call it -- the other side. Yes, my friends, that Chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like "the other side."    DR. SEUSS  Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes, The chicken crossed the road,  But why it crossed, I've not been told!    ERNEST HEMINGWAY  To die. In the rain. Alone.      MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.    GRANDPA  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.    BARBARA WALTERS  Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting and went on to accomplish its life-long dream of crossing the road.    JOHN LENNON  Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace.    ARISTOTLE  It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.    KARL MARX  It was a historical inevitability.    SADDAM HUSSEIN  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.    VOLTAIRE  I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will defend to the death its right to do it.    RONALD REAGAN  What chicken?    CAPTAIN KIRK  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.    FOX MULDER  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?    SIGMUND FREUD  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.    BILL GATES  I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook - and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.    ALBERT EINSTEIN  Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?    BILL CLINTON  I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? Could you define chicken, please?    THE BIBLE  And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.    COLONEL SANDERS  I missed one?    --------------------------------------...  Why did the chicken cross the road?    To escape KFC    Why did the second chicken cross the road?    To go look at the other chicken lying motionless on the other side.    Why didn't the third chicken cross the road?    He actually had a decent sized brain, not an acorn sized one like the other chickens had.    Why did the third chicken finally cross the road?    KFC was really close behind, he had no choice.    Why did KFC cross the road?    Why shouldn't they, their job has almost already been done for them, the three chickens only need to be baked and plus there already is a sideorder of liquidy ketchup next to each of them.  --------------------------------------...  Why did the chicken cross the road?    He wanted to get to the other side.    Why did the rooster cross the road?    He was stapled to the chicken.    Why did the turkey cross the road?    He was taped to the rooster.    LOL I MADE THIS ONE UP...I TRIED AT LEAST:D|`|225b02c8d1fe0666185520fe6a7be758aa	WarJag lol. if I could I'll give you BA and a star. but I cant bec the chicken next to me is staring me in the face.|`|eYe3xRWVaa	what came first the chicken or the egg?|`|Y7wn5ZBwaa	he wanted to show up his friend the skeleton whom didnt have the balls to do it|`|mR1iXow8aa	because michael jackson was chasing him      lol|`|D4e9jv0iaa	i dunno because he wants to    BEST ANSWER|`|CE5EH0xGaa	i chicken did it cuz she wanted to die cuz the cow said that they couldnt be lover! and the chicken didnt want to live will just another chicken!! but you know Chocolate cover pizza bites are great!!  jk i dont know if there good!! gah!!|`|cTA6OmjUaa	- How did the chicken cross the high way?    - Take the "f" out of way.|`|KT0UTX8taa	HE HE.......

UAHjJpC0aa	Yamaha Ibanez and Samick all make good guitars in that range    if you really want a guitar that plays easy and doesn't buzz,  find a local store with a good guitar tech.  He can set up the guitar properly...  and THAT is what is needed to make sure the neck is straight,  easy to play,   no buzzing.    most of the inexpensive guitars just aren't set up well, from the factory.  (and under $400 is inexpensive)  they don't spend the extra time, because everyone wants stuff to be cheap, and good labor isn't.    good luck|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Lol, it could be your guitar, but are you sure it's not just you holding down the strings too  hard or too lightly which causes the buzzing? I recommend going to a guitar store, trying out some of their guitars yourself.|`|C1Dpg03Paa	just a decent fender or yamaha for that price. if it has a decent enough setup it should meet all of those requirements (if they set the action right when you buy it, etc.)|`|od1J6BHLaa	I would suggest a Yamaha or Martin. However fret buzz can happen to any guitar. It can be from the strings, or the action could just be too low.  Another thing is do you want a Classical nylon or steel string?|`|rRCTvT7Saa	You might want to take a look at Alvarez acoustics.  I haven't played one myself, but I've only heard good things about them--even their $200 models!  Anyway, I believe they have models at around $350 or so that include an o-board tuner.

gIFYYhEWaa	Bella,  Your question is no uncommon on Yahoo Anwers.    No, it's not hard to learn to play the ukulele.  You can learn to play a simple nursery rhyme in about 5 min.  I know....b/c I teach the ukulele.  I encourage beginners to get a concert with gear tuners.  Gear tuners are what you see on a guitar.  Much easier to tune than peg tuners.  The concert is the second largest in the ukulele family, has a fuller sound b/c the body is larger, and is easier to fret b/c the frets are farther apart.  Access the Lanikai LU21C on the following site and then scan down and you'll see the different ukulele sizes.  http://www.americanmusical.com/ItemSearc...  The soprano is the standard size and the tenor is the largest.  There is a baritone ukulele also....but it's tuned to the first four strings of a guitar and sounds like a guitar without the two bass strings.  Chords:  http://www.meleukulele.com/PDFs/UkeChart...  Lessons/songs:  http://www.doctoruke.com/songs.html  Access "BEGINNERS" and you'll see how easy it is.  You can also find tons of lessons on Youtube.  Ukulele info:  http://ukulelehunt.com/  Anything you want to know about the ukulele is here.  Check and see if there's a club in your local area.  Lot's of fun playing with others.  You'll find that ukulele people are very friendly.  http://curtsheller.com/ukuleleClubs.shtm...  http://www.fleamarketmusic.com/directory...  I know this is long....but want you to have a good understanding about the ukulele.  It's a real fun instrument that's easy to learn.  Also, there is no higher or lower pitch between the soprano, concert, or tenor.  Only a fuller sound b/c of the size.  Have fun,  CowUkeA|`|xTpvnWRuaa	My grandfather used to play the ukulele. I don't think it's particularly hard to learn how to play, as long as you have the will to learn how to play it.  Soprano or tenor, depends on your tastes and aptitude I guess, the diference is, one is higher and the other is lower.    I'd do alot of research on those instruments if I were you!

qD3r5sfCaa	Controlling gravity. You could do anything with it.   - You reverse gravity and send your enemies flying   - You increase gravity a thousandfold and everything around you is crushed   - You lower the weight of stuff (pick up a building)   - Or increase weight (bullets just drop and guns weigh 400 pounds, enemies clothes get so heavy they can't breathe)   - You could make yourself lighter to leap 50 feet in the air   - You make one person the source of gravity (everything in the room flies towards him and he's smashed)   - Create gravity wells on both sides of someone (they get torn in two)   - Lastly, you could collapse gravity and shoot mini black holes.

BfdMSoz9aa	A ride cymbal and a crash cymbal are both fundemental to a basic drum kit. You don't necessarily need more than one of either cymbal to start out. Ride cymbals are used more to maintain a rhythm whereas crash symbals are used as accents. A splash cymbal is also used for accents but is not a necessary component for an initial drum kit.    If you're just learning how to play, I'd suggest sticking to the basics and remaining minimalistic until you have a solid grasp on how to play. I was taught from a young age on just a snare and slowly built up and graduated to a full kit. Rudiments are the most important thing.|`|ywXLWkruaa	The difference is the sound.  If you are short on funds they do make a multi-use cymbal that sounds like a ride cymbal when you play the middle and sounds like a crash cymbal when you hit the edge of the cymbal.|`|7jp7sTdFaa	YES! Ride cymbals have a brighter sound, more of a pang. They are used to keep beats, almost in the same way that high hats are. Crash cymbals are for strong accents and to drive the beat home. Splashes are for softer, less prominent accents. If anything, then get a ride/crash pack; splashes aren't as important. You can expand later. You could also get a crash/ride, but for God's sake, DON'T just get a 2 crash pack.|`|8jSsGfUXaa	A Ride cymbal is usually the largest and has a pingy like sound.  A Crash cymbal are your "Overhead" cymbals  Splash cymbals are usually small cymbals with a small amount of decay. Typically range from 6 - 12 "

Not 4, because 5 is the same.  Not 2 or 5, because 3 and 6 are not in the puzzle.  But it could be be 2 and 7, 4 and 5!  And f is...  Not 2, 5, or 7, because 3, 6, and 8 are not in the puzzle.  Not 4, because if 4 is f than 5 is a.  So let's try 2 and 9, 4 and 7.  F =  Not 2, 9, or 7, because 3, 10, and 8 are not in this puzzle.  So it must be 4!  So e is 5!

Slayer is sick though, and a good band for starting the really difficult stuff.

kP0JGI1waa	You need to utterly decimate the kid who called Opeth emo, his ignorance is not be tolerated (and its not like he called some metalcore band emo, this is progressive death metal, the antithesis of emo!).  People just do not understand metal, its really quite hard to grasp for some.  I am one of those sick puppies who can listen to what others call fast noise, and sometimes we forget that not everyone can do the same.  But yeah that kid still deserves to get taken behind the watershed and taught a lesson (haha i am not really that violent)    BQ: I dont play guitar, so I guess ESP if i had to pick|`|vgcY5jHuaa	I don't know. Society refuses to accept us for who we are. One kid called me a screaming drum-banging monkey because I like metal. He likes MILEY CYRUS.    The guy who insulted Opeth probably listens to the Jonas Brothers.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	I live in a communtity that's about 70% Latino, not many of the kids here are into Metal, they're too busy, blasting Kayne West, or my Two Cents in their Ipods.|`|UnsZKr4saa	As Metalheads, we should know that our music isn't accepted by the mainstream public.  People like those aren't rare by any means.  They take in whatever crap MTV shells out without second thought, and conform to whatever stereotypes come their way.  Don't hate them, feel sorry for them.    MQ: Not a guitarist.    Oh, and thanks for the Facebook add :P|`|qN5b8Qoiaa	How the **** is Opeth emo? **** those people, rock on.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	heres a fact. people who say that are unintelligent. i dont see how any true music fan could see only bad in metal and nothing good. because it really has so much to offer. and offers it in a variety of ways.   people who say that listen to lil wayne.... enough said.|`|4m1U5Z7naa	Opeth were around before any sort of emo movement, let alone the current popular one.    I strongly disagree with you about B.C. Rich, I own a Bich and it's a brilliant guitar, it plays, sounds and feels great. As for build quality I have had no problems with it, despite the pain I routinely put it through in the studio and live. The tuning stability is insane, you can play it for 6 hours and it won't go out more than about half a semitone. One of the best guitars I have ever played was a 1980's strat style B.C. Rich (California factory)    I agree with you on ESP, they make a lot better instruments than Ibanez, Dean, Cort, Squire and many other brands. PRS have started a using second factory making low cost guitars in Korea. Their Korean guitars are woeful, suitable only for firewood. Their US made guitars are fantastic instruments though. I would chose a low cost ESP any day over a cheap PRS, but i would get a PRS if I was buying a US made instrument.|`|NqzCxepGaa	they are all ******* probly lisrtening to fall out boy, hannah montana or  foof fighters    i deal wit it   dont care about it   wit out metal and rock everyone would be listening to gay techno    death 06 ur emo bring me the horizon is gay, scremo=emo|`|s6GLXC96aa	wooa they called you emo..haha(sorry for laughin)  idk wtf ppl say that...gossh ...they call me an emo and a punk bc i looove rock ... i dont really listen to metal theres only about 3 songs that i like but i dont think thats a reason to believe its not music i mean for some people it isnt but i guess everyone has different opinions...  **** that....rock is tha shiit! (haha)oo...and screw them hataz!|`|AIhL8wLkaa	It's ignorance...some people base metal off stereotypes...satanic themes, death metal vocals, too loud...there's different styles of metal for everyone...|`|RnnhjwYnaa	After years of pondering that very same question, i have come to a simple conclusion:      Metal is hard to digest        Mainstream music is "light" as in, as much as a metal fan i am, i would rather listen to a soft, pop song when my head hurts than Slayer let's say. Also, metal is by far the most complex genre today. There is a famous Baron Rojo song (Red Baron) that says "Si Beethoven vivera tocaria Rock" (If Beethoven lived, he would make Rock) Why? They are alike, composition is very hard in both and both are very creative instead of the same beat on most rap or pop songs. Want to bet?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiD2NAdt8...    look at 1:24 - 2:15    Eruption IMO is as good as any Beethoven, Bach or Vivaldi. Whatever.    Metal fans are also quite the problem, even when they are by far the most dedicated, passionate and caring for their music, they also defend it to death, resulting sometimes that a metalhead that doesn't know how to defend metal just digs deeper into the "Satanic, church burning metalhead who doesn't bath and has no future"    Hope that helps.|`|ArwRJdOCaa	Its because alot of people are too self-centered to know real music and if they dont like it, it must not be real music.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	These people are every where and there is a name for it actually an official cultural name    The Retard Nation Extraordinaire    Its basically a massive counsel of people that specialize in Ignorance.

That sucks.    There's a lot of people like that, and the only thing you can do is ignore them.|`|OXvH2CgLaa	To be honest with ya, I used to be one of those people who didn't think metal was music either. Until I heard Bring Me The Horizon. They were the first real metal band I ever got into. I listened to Godsmack but they're like heavy metal/hard rock...    People like this are very narrow headed and pretty much convinced that "cookie monster VOCALS" are a pathetic excuse for vocals. These people piss me off too but all I can really say is that you need to remember these are the people who have Miley Cyrus, The Jonas Brothers, Daughtry and every other mainstream music sensation jamming on their playlist. So their opinion doesn't really mean much to me personally.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Idiot.      I guess Pantera is Pop-Punk and Metallica is Classic Rock too?  I love it when some noob makes a comment like that.  I guess becasue it ain't all blastbeats and distortions Opeth is puss.  Funny part is I don't even really care for Opeth, and I would never label em like that.    Not you. But him.  People are insecure I suppose.    As for ESP or PRS... unless you are Mike Amott... what difference does it make.  Unless this guy can shred like mad, an expensive guitar just means he wasted a lot of money.    There is a reason a lot of GREAT proffessional guitarists still use Jacksons, Epiphone and BC Rich and the like...  because for 99% of playing they are fine.  Hetfield uses a lot of ESPs...great Guitars.  Other people use PRS, also great.    But that dude, as musch as I dislike the term sounds liek a poseur.  Anyone who truly knows anything knows it ain't the metal that matters, but the meat.    Me personally, I play Schecters.  They fit my hands, and my budget.  And spending an extra 1-2000 on a guitar would no tmake a difference to my playing.  And I highly doubt it helps his.    As long as a guitar or bass isn't a cheap 1 pickup walmart special, it'll do the job for most of us.  Hell, Jo Bench from Bolt Thrower plays a BC Rich Thunderbird.  Dave Mustaine plays on Deans.  He has also used BC Rich, Jackson ans ESPs extensively.  Kerry King Plays BC RIch. Steve Harris plays a blaste Fender P-Bass.  Mike Amott plays Deans now.    Mind you all of them are dolled up or tweaked to one degree or another, but the point is that most of teh difference in gear is pure preferrence, and anyone who says otherwise is smoking something or a poseur.    As for ESPs... well dude, almost all the big names in thrash and Melodeath seem to have played them or are playing them, so I thnk they might jsut be ok.  3 of my friends play them, and I have never heard a complaint.|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	it's best to ignore those kind of people. they're probably the same people who think Lil Wayne is a real rockstar|`|LkN5nr6faa	It's just ignorance. It's nearly impossible to convince them differently so it's better just to let them think what they want and let them listen to Lil Wayne.    MA: PRS are GREAT in terms of build quality, they are expensive but if I could afford one I'd definitely get one.

I have a Capricorn female friend who is 6 feet, very good looking and attractive and another who is 5 ft. 7". Not exactly short.

I have friends who have Saturnstron in the 1st house and are all close to 6 ft.  The aspects that the Ascendant receives has a very big influence on the appearance and more so than a planet in the 1st house. Capricorn rising and Saturn aspecting the Ascendant would give shortness since that planet represents obstruction, hindrance, reservation etc...|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	Well,    I have a Capricorn Ascendant,and I'm 5'8" (female)|`|IRQvzk5saa	Im both cap sun and rising and im 6ft 1in. im black    My grandad was a cap sun and he was 6 ft 0in black    One of my teachers this semester is a cap sun and he's no taller than 5 ft 9in white dude    I had 3 co workers that were cap suns...1 was 6ft 0in and was puero rican.

GFas8Eayaa	nahuel          oh and merchantofvenice is the answer to question 101. you skipped a few, which is not advised since you will need to know all of the answers at the end of the riddle.   just saying.
jgEvnYNlaa	Simple rhythms and notes heh? It takes a lot to get the feel and drive to play Rock and Roll without sounding like a robot. Only backup? Sounds like you already think it is below you. I have met many keyboard players that had the same attitude and could not play if you spotted them the ock and the oll.|`|bkoTtsh8aa	choose the ones that you don't know and start them first. if there is a melody line, play that first to get the rhythm. Once you have all the rhythyms, than go back and work on the notes. They don't have to be perfect, and you can leave out some of the notes in the chords to make them easier to play and to avoid bad notes|`|aeQpPUmgaa	I would go over a few one day (start with the easiest), basically get the notes down and work on the rhythm, and just add more everyday.  You can do it!  :)|`|gh2FdQ7waa	just dooo it! =]    try not to stress and think about the deadline    practice makes perfect  but no ones perfect =]|`|GqlLcRWtaa	try 5-7 pgs. a night|`|CrAwmz65aa	I know the feeling.  On the first day of class in the university, the professor announces everything we will do during the semester, and it seems overwhelming.

Divide that and you come up with only 4 pages a day!|`|kOABLsK5aa	dont think of the big picture or it may be harder just take it a page at a time and then in no time you will no them maybe do like 4-8 pages if your that into it

AwBVoWOaaa	I think this is her year, but I believe she gave a better performance in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD (which I think is a better film).    It's either her or Meryl and I think they're finally going to award Kate. She was robbed in 97. Helen Hunt did not deserve that Oscar. She was one of the weakest in that category.|`|djp7q9mMaa	i really want her to so i guess i think/say yes|`|PnokXbjraa	omg. i absolutely LOVE kate. ive seen   both revolutionary road and the reader.  shes amazing in both. but leonardo  decaprio   definately got screwed over 4 not getting a   nomination. he overpowered winslet in rev. rd.  and completely owned the movie.|`|zDV0u5QRaa	She may because she won the Golden globe and a SAG, which usually leads to the winning of an Oscar. But, I've read that she may not get it because the academy hasn't been kind to her in the past. I think she's amazing, she definitely deserves it and I have a feeling this may be her year.
2TNFQAQEaa	I have the same problems deciding.  I'll give you a couple of good choices:    If you have a bunch of girl friends, you might want to take them to Bride Wars.  My friends that are girls say its pretty funny, and its the perfect chick flick.    Paul Blart: Mall Cop is supposedly filled with corny jokes and bathroom humor, but if you like seeing Kevin James do crazy stuff in a gigantic mall, then this would be your movie.    Hotel For Dogs looks harmless enough.    My friends and the critics tell me Inkheart and New in Town are pretty good, but its a fantasy and a rom-com, so who knows?    This Friday, Pink Panther 2 comes out, and if you liked the first one, then this might be a number-one pick.  Be warned, though - opening weekend crowds are horrible!    Coraline looks pretty good, but I'm a nerd who's read the book, so whatever.  Its by the guy who directed Nightmare Before Christmas, so that's a BIG plus!    Good luck choosing a movie, and have fun with your friends!    PS Don't sneak into an R-rated movie like this one guy on here says; its really overrated and its not cool.  If you want to see an adult movie, just get your mom or dad to buy the tickets for you, and then sit five rows away from them.|`|AA12270666	Coraline  Hotel For Dogs  Paul Blart Mall Cop      i reccomend talking to your parents about what movies to see instead of asking strangers on the interent.    but i hope you and your friends have fun at you rmovie.|`|Oe2davbxaa	Bolt|`|S8okmN6gaa	bedtime stories|`|3S0WRhWCaa	According to Y/A guidlines you are too young to be asking this question.  However, Hotel for Dogs might be good.  Every ticket purchased provides a donation to animal shelters across the country.|`|DWCbH2jTaa	coraline  bride wars  twilight  hotel for dogs  ink heart  pink panther 2  paul blart:mall cop|`|6BTvuPwcaa	There are a few good choices.  But don't try to sneak into another movie (rated R) you can be kicked out of the entire theatre for it and how embarrassing would THAT be?|`|9ad188f0da0ee8a93abed4eb7b2bf545aa	you should buy a ticket to some pg movie and go into a r movie. just make sure the time for the pg movie is close to the r movie that's what me and my friends do
oK6yK1R9aa	I do not know which websites you've visited, but every anime sites i visit, Anidb, Anime News Network and My Anime List, has not reported any official announcement for the confirmation of the 3rd season of the Anime "Rosario + Vampire".    If a series is officially confirmed/announced to air, a page is instantly made for it on the sites i mentioned, but right now there is no web page for the 3rd season of "Rosario + Vampire", which means there has been no official announcement for it yet.    If you don't believe me, try visiting these sites and you yourself conduct a search for Rosario+Vampire Season 3 and you won't find anything.     here are the links for those sites:  http://www.anidb.net/  http://myanimelist.net/anime.php  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/    These sites are known to many anime fans to be accurate and trustworthy on every information related to Anime/Manga.

cXRRP6ttaa	i think it's better to act out than to do nothing. i used to be like that - no nothing and spare myself the embarrassment if that occurs.  but u have to realize that everyone has different tastes and just b/c someone isn't into u, doesn't mean it should effect ur self-esteem.  so if u keep thinking of this person, better to ask her out.    also, its not good idea to just love the idea of love and not the person. eventually, after time pass, u should actually love that person. it can get unhealthy for the other person if that isn't the case.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	You are who you are.|`|B7WIZdglaa	Hm, im an aquarius sun, sagg rising, and capricorn in venus.. so we're sort of similar. i think regardless of what sign you are, if you have a crush then go talk to her and try to get her to go out with you. Why not? You'll never know unless you try. Be confident, and even if she says no.. who cares! Theres so many girls out there. I'm not in love with the thought of being in love, but I have a specific idea of what real love is.. and that's what I look for. Just stop gazing at her from afar and go effin talk to her. If you don't, then you just look more like a *ussy.|`|ythN9BQgaa	Only Libras fall in love with love... this is cleary impossible.|`|of3jiuDiaa	I would recommend taking a step out of the clouds and sitting in reality for a moment.

oYwjZuv8aa	UPDATE: One of our readers spoke to a staff member at B97 (Annette Wade) and was informed that they could not disclose further details surrounding the suspension. However, both Stevie-G and Teapot are expected to re-appear on the radio tomorrow evening.|`|oHAVaWUZaa	I was wondering the same thing!  I heard the manager guy get on the radio and apologize to fans and say that they were suspended, but I dont know why...|`|wxpATfwPaa	They should be back tomorrow, as stated above. No info is being released about the circumstances surrounding the suspension.|`|eImCJ24Iaa	At first I thought it was a joke when I first heard the manager apologizing on the radio.....I've been looking all over the place trying to find out!|`|m7nrQEflaa	People from y!a?

ooFE5XXTaa	Well it's embarrassing.      But ...    I was at a rave ... and this HOT *** GUY was signaling me to hook up with him. Of course the both of us were on e so I wanted to so bad because ANY kind of touching is like sex times 1000. But anyway ... my friend was like ... "no honey, don't do it ... I love you and I care about your safety" ... well she's my BFF so I said OK. So we went away from him and danced all night and had a great time.    I thank her every single day for saving me from him. Turns out he crashed his car that night and died. He was drinking heavily and went off the road. Well if it wasn't for "my squishy" I would have been killed.    I love my little squishy. And now I pay alot more attention at raves.|`|MRIjGnPKaa	I had to get up and talk to a comittee of teachers about my mentally challenged older brother and the death of my mentally challenged younger brother for a meeting about the treatment of special needs students in that particular school.  I really did not want to discuss the stuff, but my mom's best friend was there for me the entire time, and her daughter.  Her daughter and i became friends right away, and she helped me shape what i was going to say and jumped in when i was struggling... etc.  looking back, that was one of my best experiences.
3yvuMkzTaa	stream the audio through your computer. Get a good set of computer speakers!!!|`|I7clFYTZaa	The only way to pull distant stations in is to get an antenna up high. On the roof if possible (or even higher) and you should also consider buying an outdoor FM antenna. I bought mine at Radio Shack. They are similar to TV antennas but are better suited to FM radio signals. It also has to be aimed properly as FM is directional. I'm tempted to say something about those Bose speakers but I'll bite my tongue.
5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	You might want to check eBay listings from other sellers and see what similar magazines are going for.    Here's an idea though.  The magazine ads inside may be worth more separately than the whole magazine itself.  People pay decent money for old car ads, etc.  For example, maybe you can get $5 each for 5 ads out of the magazine, making it worth $25, where it might have sold for only $2 by itself.  Search eBay for magazine ads and see what they're getting.    Keep in mind that the condition of the magazine is very important.  No matter how you decide to sell it, take great pictures.  Use the macro settings on your digital camera for closeups.
aS0nijbhaa	Megadeth = Megahead  Iced Earth = Icehead  Thin Lizzy = Thinhead  Led Zeppelin = Ledhead  3 Inches of Blood = 3 Inches of Head  Helloween = Hellohead  Diamond Head = Uhm... Diamond Head?  Aerosmith = Aerohead  Van Halen = Van Head    That's where my creativity ends. And no, those aren't all my favorites, I just chose random ones that sounded funny.    MQ: I'll often simply look up about a half dozen to a dozen songs by a band, and listen to them. If I like them, I'll check out more. Otherwise, I'll probably get the Greatest Hits, unless they recommended a specific album.|`|kwB9e37vaa	I am a Ramoneshead.  hahahahaha, thats funny.  hmm, well my bf got me into the kills, so i just looked things up by them on youtube. i think i might buy no wow, if that explains|`|Mx11gL67aa	I am a BEATLESHEAD =] and proud of it ;]    MQ: usually, i listen to a few well known songs to get started.|`|nhk5zzaeaa	Gem!!!!!

Yeah.    MA: I tend to listen to a greatest hits compilation and then go back to their studio albums if I like them enough.|`|LAvBfjKWaa	I am a... Velvethead.  And a Ledhead of course.  And a Distpatchhead.    And I usually take their ten best songs or their best album, depending.|`|LkN5nr6faa	I'm a Metalhead.    I think that clearly explains that Metallica is just about as metal as you can get.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	I am a StrungOut Head.....that sounds super bad.      MQ:  I usually ask the person that recommends the music which album they liked best.  If its metal, I ask which one was most popular, because Im a wimp when it comes to metal and I tend to lean towards the commercialized sound, then get into the good stuff.    IE Venom - Listened to Black Metal first, then fell head over heels in love with the whole sound.|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	I am a proud Nirvanahead?    it sounds really weird!|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I'm A Panterahead|`|x3vhAFMyaa	I am a Cruehead    mq- I listen to their most famous song first to see if its good|`|G1glDc5Iaa	Metalhead.

If a band can't pull together a solid album, then they aren't worth my time.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I am a Redhotchillipepperhead.    MQ: I usually just download about 5 songs and listen to each of them.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Iron Maiden + Head = MaidenHead    and IDK.    Good to see you back though Gem.|`|Vkff8N8Taa	I am a 'dead head'      I would listen to one of the studio albums that really defined a band musically.

MA: I start off with a single and if I like it I just proceed to download some more of their songs that I usually end up liking so its all good.|`|7lCJsp0naa	So would I be a Ledhead or a Zeppelinhead or a LedZeppelinhead?

Vkff8N8Taa	Black Hole Sun, because its one of the few songs that sound new every time I listen to it. And, Have you seen the video? Creepy...|`|0p9wHjSWaa	Black Hole Sun.  My fave was Fell on Black Days though.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Black Hole Sun. A timeless classic that could have been a hit in any decade.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Spoonman..... way more of a feelgood song.|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	hm...i love the video for Black Hole Sun, it's so weird but amusing.    Spoonman, however, is a great tune and much less depressing.|`|rkh01QI2aa	???spoonman for sure....but my fav is fourth of july???|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	yes! Spoonman! what a riff! what a groove, what a spoon solo!!! one of my top Soundgarden tunes :) 'Black Hole Sun' bores the hell out of me... i never understood the appeal of that tune compared to their other stuff...|`|tMuNri7Laa	black hole sun|`|sCuumWVTaa	Dude Rusty Cage|`|pW55qClKaa	They are both favorites of mine, but I have to say Spoonman.  I really don't know how to explain why, but it's just an all around amazing song.  Arguably one of the best songs of the grunge era and probably the best Sondgarden song.|`|3adf34a77d61d407aad0b9e439793108aa	Black Hole sun "SoundGarden|`|La7BL4Zsaa	Spoonman all the way. Black Hole Sun is just sorta their hit song, repetitive and catchy so people can sing along and feel like they know the song. Spoonman is much better i think, plus a great song name
dZpU1wiLaa	Well, it depends on your software, the track numbers and everything like that. If you use Audacity (a free download) you are limited to a single track export, but you can 'key-frame' the gain or cross-fade it, so if you modify each song independently, and apply the fade track by track, that's the easiest, least expensive and best way. The tracks can then be added to the CD once faded. Some CD compilers will allow the 'fade between track' option allowing it to be completed faster and less professionally. If you need more info, email me. I can't say much more unless I know what you want faded (like a head-tail fade or what), what resources you have, and the level or duration of the fade.
8D361MUKaa	Sure, sort of - but there is no interval of a "third".    The most used cords in pop music are:     I, IV and V(7)    If we use the C scale (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C)  I=CEG  IV=FAC  V7=GBDF how ever is is often played GBF - leaving out the D    Note how the notes are ever other one. C-E-G (missing D and F) or F-A-C (missing G and B). When you have every other note like that you  have some sort of a third. Thirds come is Major (C-E) and Minor (C-Eb)     The simplest cords are just three notes. (just two notes aren't a cord they are an interval). A major cord has a minor interval on top of a major interval (CEG C-E - Major III, E-G minor iii). A minor cord is just the reverse (CEbG C-Eb  - minor iii, Eb-G Major III)     If you have cords with smaller intervals than a 3rd you can invert (flip them around) until everything ends up with relationships that can be related to 3rd in some form (even if you have to "account" for missing notes - like the V7 cord often leaving out the five)|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Yeah. In tonal music, anyway.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	For the most part, particularly in popular and jazz music, although that is a very big generalization.|`|AtAOlUhHaa	Yes, that is basically true.
utSUdo1Daa	I wouldn't say she hates guys especially since she married one. I think her songs are often "girl positive" like Pink's and Kelly Clarkson's. All 3 of their songs focus on negative aspects of relationship because many girls can relate to these things. Then again, each has positive songs about relationships also....It's interesting if a girl writes a negative song about men or her relationships with them she is said to be "man hater" for example Alanis Morrisette. Far as I know she's written one song that was angry towards an ex, but yet this has been the way she's been portrayed since that song came out. Now, the All American Rejects have a negative songs aimed at ex gf's (Gives you hell) but no one is calling them "woman haters." LOL. Hmmm, interesting....|`|AA12100229	With the exception of DCs "Cater to You" Bey has always been a little man basher even in DC.|`|hjZWNlOBaa	ermm, shes married : / loll  and yeah i noticed that a bit in if i were a boy but i think shes just saying how heartbreaking boys can be rather than lashing out at them :)
oHbFCuGDaa	NOT ME!!thats for sure!  I LOVE them!

They have no talent.  Their singing voices are not very good - they sound and their music sounds like all the other Disney brats and boybands past.  Their performances are ridiculously stupid - to the point of embarrassment.      Note:  this is only my opinion.  I realize that there are people out there who LOVE them, and then there are the people who HATE them.  I don't feel for them either way, and I certainly don't wish to offend - I'm just exercising my privilege to post my opinion of them.  And to get 2 points.|`|0p6bhMZYaa	absolutely not me !!   i love the Jonas Brothers!!!  i dont know why ppl hate Jonas Brothers ...  maybe they are totally jealous|`|13uu4bbQaa	I don't hate them but I dislike them very much!

First, my friend Baily is already going to have babbies with him, she's said so about 2 years ago, so you're late on that boat. Also, two if my friends met him, and said he was super short, and really small. And, he might be going to jail for awhile on gun charges. I know him being away isn't an issue, but he's gonna lose ALOT of money to lawyers and to the courts.     Why not Kevin Sorbo instead?|`|4noWBPlUaa	Lol.

16t0eV0Uaa	because he is a pompous arrogant moron.    One person at a concert throws a bottle to his head and he quits the show.    He was the reason the best member of Guns N roses left the band (Slash).    He talks smack on other people for no reason except to start ****.    He treats Guns and Roses like it is the "axl Rose Project" more than an actual band.    He has gotten Plastic surgery,  that alone gives reason to think he is shallow.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Did you hear? He broke up Guns N' Roses than tried to make money off their name and is just a whiny Son of a B*tch|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Axl has some....anger issues.    edit-Guys your not supposed to ask these questions because tomorrow is his brithday or something so you have to wait until after the partys over its only polite.|`|YbmklSzGaa	He's full of sh*t.|`|llNoDDCsaa	NO WAY! I LOVE HIM!    Are you kidding me? I met him and he was so nice. He says you're pretty and smiles a ton. And you can tell it's not fake. He's a nice guy but TOTALLY lost and twisted. Maybe people would like him more if he got some major help. The way he acts towards others is unacceptable and completely immature. Since he's bipolar and depressed, it's hard for him to communicate appropriately; he just doesn't have well developed social skills. He acts on impulse and doesn't really think thoroughly. He has frequent mood swings and constantly craves attention from others. Along with that, he is very disorganized and defiantly has punctuality issues. Actually, I feel sad for him because he was abused as a child, he lost all of his friends, he's hated by many, he hasn't gotten a woman and settled down, and he doesn't know how to grow up and be a mature adult.  He dug this ditch for himself that he can't get out of. He's just a lost little boy in an older man's body.|`|6qPVGyNQaa	he has a horrible voice, maybe a shallow to some but when it comes to music that is a big turn off for me|`|Md0XccoPaa	G n R USED to be good.  There new album is just terrible, while Appetite could be considered one of the best albums of that time.  Maybe even in rock history, depending on who you are.    Axl Rose is a self absorbed douche bag.  He always has been, and always will be.  Which is ultimatly leading to his downfall.    Wahhh.|`|CEkxWCwXaa	Because he has LSD (if you've read the Heroin Diaries by Nikki Sixx, you'd know what that meant. For those who don't, it means Lead Singer Disease.)    I loooove GNR, but as soon as they hit it big, Axl turned into an asshat and began to only care about the money.     So all in all, he's just a major douche.|`|xrCbyfu5aa	because back in the day he was a cokcy jacka$$. one of the best frontmen of all time but really cocky, he rubbed alot of people the wrong way|`|iyFibWTWaa	because he's a douchebag the size of canada. I know someone who went backstage and met Guns n roses at a concert and he said that the band was really cool except for Axl who was a douche and wouldn't even talk to  the guy I know. Also, he's arrogant and greedy as well as he broke up guns n roses (well I don't mind that cus I hate GNR but still it's not cool to ruin your band). He also would just stop playing concerts and be a little b*tch whenever something he didn't like happened on stage.|`|a984cQjKaa	he's bi-polar, which makes him act erratically.  that's why people think he's a huge douchebag.  and maybe he is.  but that's why.|`|To5mQxOPaa	Because as a person, he's just a jerk. The answers above explain more as to why he is a jerk too, haha.|`|oonb6rXYaa	I like Axl. I mean, he is a douche, but that's what I expect from him. So it doesn't really affect me.|`|vmgu7bbeaa	Because they are jealous...they wish they could produce epic albums like guns and rose had (and hopefully will continue to do)|`|bFIN5gfWaa	Many people, including me think that he broke up Guns N Roses (you can't call chinese democracy guns n roses) I don't hate him, i like him but i do believe he kind of destroyed Guns.|`|KaNVTodRaa	imo he didnt make very good music at anytime.   and i personally dont like him because, i dont like his msuic whatsoever and i dont have the time of day to waste my life doing anything that has to do with axl rose, because well, as many others would agree hes retarded, man...|`|1vCoaf08aa	He's a puss who talks crap but doesn't back it up.    If I recall, he was too scared to fight Vince Neil.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I love Axl Rose and Guns N' Roses, but he is kinda an asshole|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	because he's a jackass.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Because he's an arrogant asshole, that's why.    Plus his voice is annoying.    Everyone from Tommy Hilfiger (those of you who don't know who he is, he's a famous fashion designer) to Kurt Cobain have fought with him.|`|aBqJhdufaa	He's an asshole,bitches a lot, and his freaking retarded rants. Like:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piiIVSQdo...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUhSa1_Cm...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2HuEwWtA...  And he's not a really good singer, and he like has no friends and he has a problem with Slash. Need anything else?    :P|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i dont hate him.  i think he's a douche for taking 15 years to release a sub-par album but i dont hate him. i say reform the original GNR and get it over with already. oh! and lose the fuc*ing cornrows.
mCEKMWTYaa	Black Sabbath for sure! That is when Ozzie still had a brain.|`|OXvH2CgLaa	Masters of Reality! I love that album and judging from it you will too =)|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I would pick Master of Reality or Among the Living.  Youthanasia, in my opinion, is a mediocre album.    Sabotage is a good Sabbath album too, if you don't have that one yet.|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	i'd go with 'Master of Reality'... then if still in doubt "Among The Living' ... then 'Youthanasia'...    all great albums, but although damn good i'd choose other Megadeth albums over 'Youthanasia' (anything before it really ;).    You've got Sabbath's 'Sabotage' right?|`|CTQNPj56aa	Black Sabbath's MOR|`|rR6lwxjjaa	id get master's of reality, i have that cd and i like it a lot|`|kwB9e37vaa	this isn't one of those you mentioned but..... buy The Weird Tales of The Ramones....or too tough to die.  or you could buy Smell of Female in honor of Lux :'(|`|nZba18Lpaa	Anthrax they kick *** especially that album|`|AA11669073	I'd go with Youthanasia...pretty much because I'm a 'deth fan.    But just YouTube some songs from each.    I suggest Victory form Youthanasia.  Sweet Leaf from Sabbath.  Caught In A Mosh from Anthrax.    All on the albums you can't decide from!|`|7Pm2VHUEaa	Megadeth for sure! Anthrax is overrated.|`|165d3c1abc1184497065920f9de45719aa	Youthanasia

ZY5MyX63aa	It was last year after the Olympics, suppossedly.    And yes......I think he had the world on a string.....and then goes and does something so moronic????    I think he's a total DOUCHE now.    This is why we need to have our role models be people like: family members, community people, those who build homes for the poor, feed the hungry, heal illness, fight for freedom, teach our children,and save animals from abuse.    Edit:  To the LOSERS who say that "everyone" smokes/has smoked pot......WRONG!    I have NOT, nor have MANY people that I know.    And I come from a very "liberal" family.    To "Boozy"...well....we can all tell a lot about you that you would actually NAME YOURSELF that........wow......how the heck do YOU KNOW what "outstanding accomplishments" the poster has achieved???  STFU and go drink some more "Booze".|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	yes    he should have been smart and make sure there was no camera when he was doing it    stupid    he could have lost all his endorsements and not be in 2012 olympics and i was gonna go on that one    eversince 08 olympics he's been gambling, smoking, drinking and hanging out with whores and strippers    he should get back to training    stay out of the limelight|`|M78fYcO1aa	I am also extremely disappointed!!  He was one of my role models too!!  He did it recently and it was only once, which sort of makes it better, but not by much!! He got caught doing a bong and lost all of his . I feel endorsements bad for him but it was a really stupid thing to do!!     **Charlie**|`|7BzH3Dw3aa	I am extremely dissapointed!  He was a role model, and people looked up to him.  He was a fish! Why would he ruin his life?  And no, not everyone does drugs, you would think he was stronger and waaaay smarter than that.    Guess it goes to show some of the best role models are no different.|`|toK0unHNaa	Ruin his life? Nice try.    Pot is harmless. It's not as though he was doing Heroin or Coke.|`|7a5900dd33706d6ef39661952113f6deaa	Nope, he can blaze all he wants.  The picture was taken last year, who ever submitted them is a snitch though.|`|k39bNUgeaa	No because a lot of people smoke    But just because he is famous its wrong    You people are making a big deal about something that is so small|`|UPdJF0tyaa	im very disappointed.  i was so upset.  but its his life he can do whateverrrr he wants!|`|ASeQFTFRaa	no.  everyone in the world smokes.  well most people have, atleast once.  just becausse he is famous doesn't mean that he is worse than the thousands of kids i go to school with everyday that come to school stoned.|`|Lth8UVJfaa	no|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	i was shocked actually...but anywayzzzz everyone makes mistakes and i am even more disturbed that some sh!t@ss snitched on him...probablly to make money.|`|EE1f7yNmaa	recently.|`|Okes2LCuaa	I am somewhat disappointed, yes.|`|LbGRsCTKaa	A lot of money seems to ruin even the best.   Which is a shame.|`|TCECDZxxaa	ahh, people put to much pressure on celebs and that they should be perfect role models. yeah it was stupid, but ask anyone in the world if theyve done drugs SO MANY people have. it doesnt make it right but people shouldnt be so judgemental and hyprocritcal, ya know?|`|2Z7eXVeWaa	Absolutely not. In fact, I think it's TERRIBLY FUNNY that people like YOU who saw him as a super human role model because of his swimming abilities are appalled by his behavior and all of a sudden aren't so cool with him...ridiculous. You should be even more amazed at him now to know that he won the olympics all the meanwhile smoking pot...HAHA! Good for him. He also got a DUI when he was only 19, are you even MORE disappointed in the fact that he's made of flesh now?

I'll send the links in the email ;)|`|16t0eV0Uaa	They are a band you need to listen to the entire album to fully appriciate, much like bands like Pink Floyd and Radiohead.    I suggest start off with their proper debut and then go to ().     If you want more songish songs from them, then try Takk,  with the song Hoppipola (which has a great string score to boot).|`|4pi8z5TLaa	The song from the Prince Of Persia 4 commercial  Sigur Rs- Saeglopur|`|cUjcn2lsaa	I am not familiar with the band unfortunately, but send either Emily or olive an email, both are massive fans of Sigur Ros!

vyHe3Lfdaa	It's one of my favorites from Dark Side of the Moon.  It's only behind Money, Time, and Us and Them.    The singing in that song is epic.|`|mCEKMWTYaa	Dark Side Of The Moon is one of the best ever albums.  As someone else here said, you do have to really understand Pink Floyd to get what this album means.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	I love the album through and through but that is a great song, her voice is amazing.|`|G1glDc5Iaa	If u don't get pink floyd u don't get this song|`|3dpIt3PIaa	I like it, but it doesn't reach my top ten.

AA11048862	No she did|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Yes I did but that was okay. Because I met my husband a few days after it happened.|`|y6406A92aa	Not yet..|`|WpWzrdO6aa	Almost there..... And you?|`|87yovKYlaa	not yet, and i have tried everything but sleeping with his brother, and i find his brother repulsive so that won't be happening. so i guess this marriage sticks forever cause i apparently can't run him off.|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	yes, its happend onetime|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Yes, started talking marriage too soon (after about 6 months) with my last gf, who was recently divorced and didn't even want to think about remarrying anytime soon.

Haven't observed it, actually, but I watched an episode of "The Universe" on the History Channel and one of the subject matter experts on camera was a gorgeous 35-year-old brunette--Dr. Amy Mainzer--an astronomer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratories.    She makes me wish I'd taken more science in college!  (But I might not have been able to concentrate if there had been girls like her in my classes.)    Young attractive women rock!  No rule says females in authority have to be frumpy.|`|AA10836766	The only example I know of is Marg Helgenberger's "CSI:" role as "acting LVMPD/CSI boss" Catherine Willows...    Or the syndicated 1985 British crime drama "Dempsey and Makepeace" starring real-life marrieds Michael Brandon(NYPD Det. Jim Dempsey) and Glynnis Barber(Lady--and London Metro Police Det. Sgt.--Harriet Makepeace)...    Any others you can think of?
bLg4b1MOaa	I'm pretty sure they don't like it just because of the vampires and all the myth stuff and they wont give it the time of day. :(  btw: you really should read the books.. the movies are amazing but I prefer the books..  DON'T READ NEW MOON IN PUBLIC!!!! I was crying soo much in my study hall class over it.. It was really embarrassing!|`|FbaLNZqTaa	I can respect the fact that it got so many young girls reading, and I suppose it might seem cool if your a virgin to Gothic literature, but it's extremely predictable & repetitious. Also it's all goo and no smut... ;)|`|8wv5ihchaa	because that's all people talks about, and its annoying. Its like Harry Potter, that's annoying too.|`|ePt4qPxNaa	I guess they are just jelause or something.    I have watched like..umm.. tons of movies, and i haven't hated any of my movies, i just don't like them, which doesn't mean i hate them. not even power ranger movies:D|`|k0cNvskDaa	I think a lot of people dislike Twilight because the books are, from what I've gathered from reading various reviews and excerpts, very poorly written examples of a woman's desperate sexual fantasies (if you don't believe that, try googling what inspired Stephanie Meyer to write the series in the first place). The books also attempt to completely rewrite vampire lore and not in a good way (Sparkling vampires? Are you kidding me?) and the characters are one-dimensional walking caricatures with no real depth. Also, the heroine is only interested in pretty people and vampires are apparently always beautiful so anything less is a waste of her time which tells girls reading it to aspire to only date people like the main hero Edward. These are just a few of the reasons many people are coming to dislike or already dislike the Twilight series. This doesn't mean that people who love the series have to agree with me, but these are some fairly big reasons many others don't absolutely worship Stephanie Meyer or Twilight.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	I'm just jealous because Meyer wrote the book and I didn't.|`|PumYhJSvaa	I haven't seen it. I did like the book, but the review my brother gave the movie makes me not want to see it. We have very similar taste and he didn't have anything good to say about it. I will watch it when it comes out on dvd and judge it for myself though.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	Only because people talk about it so much. People are just tired of hearing it.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	because of twilight harry potter & the half blood prince got pushed back,well that's why i hate it.|`|RAxe7X3xaa	Because People Are Retarded.  End of story.  Geeze, I thought everyone knew that.|`|htpvTMHWaa	I hate Twilight because now girls think if you're not like Edward Cullen, you're not good enough for them.|`|rGgDhGywaa	yes,  It's become a giant cult like thing,  where a ton of teenagers fantasize about vampires who were written about by a poor excuse of an author|`|3lrjraWLaa	I don't know ANYONE (personaly) that hates that movie! :O GASP!  But if they do, it's probably lots of guys 'cause they are all jelous because all of us girls are in love with Edward  even though he is a fictional character     the movie would have been better if you read the books first, they are AMAZING

l46COY9eaa	I never thought about it until now, good question! I hope so, like you said we had rock'n'roll, (the first rock, like from Elvis, being a big deal, then in '69 the whole Woodstock movement, the 80's it was hard rock/heavy meta and alternitive, then grunge and hip hop) So yeah, I think we are totally due for something new! I can't figure out which way that would go since it almost seems like everything that can be done has been done.

oonb6rXYaa	It really depends.    Rock can mean a lot, like artists like Radiohead, Oasis, and The Beatles have shown. But artists like Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Nickelback can show that it can mean essentially nothing. And not all rap is misogynistic, which Nas, 2Pac, and Mos Def have definitely shown.    So it really depends on what you listen to.|`|8UfL6Yenaa	Rock definitely.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Rock.|`|ibDadEHDaa	Good Rap has amazing lyrical meaning. Bad Rap is just crap.    Same goes for rock|`|CTQNPj56aa	what type of rock?  like punk, metal, progressive, gothic, glam?|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	Rock by far, rap i crap!|`|LwqM7EHVaa	of course rock! rock has the best song writers ever; John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Roger Waters, and Jim Morrison.. But Tu Pac was a good song writer as well..|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	both but with rap, the nonsense gets known more|`|zkCH7PN5aa	Rock by very far|`|QuPM0ty8aa	I say Rock Music does.|`|165d3c1abc1184497065920f9de45719aa	Rock|`|sPMJkvkEaa	rap but not all artist only rare artist like common 2pac some songs kanye west and artist dat talk about real stuff u kno more like poerty with a beat|`|rGgDhGywaa	If you look at today's modern rock and rap, rock would defiantly win,  but back in the days, rock was more upfront, while rap was something savory, it was something to dig through (except, you know, for digital underground and the beastie boys, but we can ignore them for now)|`|AA10140520	I like  Aerosmith's remix of "Walk This Way" with Run DMC(?)-When I heard the remix for the first time, I went out & bought the cassette with the original version, but didn't get what I expected-I didn't like it. I seen Aerosmith in concert & I love how he sings the chorus-just like the remix/awesome melody. I like 2 songs by 2 Live Crew; The F-ck shop & Me So Horny,-& maybe some other rap songs from the 80's that bring memories from my teen yrs.-otherwise I hate all other rap, esp. the new stuff.|`|pW55qClKaa	Rock by far.  Just listen to the bands like Alice in Chains.  Layne Staley (their singer) wrote some great songs about his struggle against drug addiction.  Bands like Pink Floyd also have some great songs like Comfortably Numb that have great meanings as well.  As for rap, well, I can't think of anything with a meaning.|`|CTM29j3Aaa	I like both. I think the old school (rap) stuff has more of a message. Rock is more about the music and rap is more about the lyrics IMO.     Just to clarify I am talking about the OLD rap stuff, not the rap today which is total BS.    That being said there are some really meaningful rock tracks, such as a lot of the stuff by the Beatles.|`|BJQCt30Maa	rock. no doubt. if you think about the origins of rock, they were just the lowly kids who dropped out because they hated school. rock was all they had. it has evolved in to more than that  but rock has more meaning and more talent behind it. it doesn't take much to talk fast in to a microphone. but try to play a guitar while doing that and then you'll find out what talent really is|`|tyCnjhXCaa	that's not even a question. sample:    Now this is what they've been waiting for  Ya dig, Santana  Weezy F.  Ay Wayne  What up man  What you been workin' on *****?  Oh you know, I got Currency's new album  And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig  Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too *****  That's what it is  But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together  That's that "I Can't Feel My Face ****" they know that  So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide  Guess what, we already did    vs    Black then white are, all i see in my infancy.  Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.  Lets me see.    As below, so above and beyond, I imagine  drawn beyond the lines of reason.  Push the envelope. Watch it bend.    Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.  Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must  Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.    rap vs. rock isn't a contest, in any aspect. the only time it was, was in the 90's with the likes of old snoop, outkast and hell, the beastie boys and rage, the best of both worlds. now they're not even comparable in complexity, talent, and meaning. rock wins in a landslide..|`|GWR3q9Draa	rockk!!!
jLvlcoFBaa	It's fiction. You misunderstood the film.    Six actors depict different dimensions and phases of Dylan's life and public persona.    It tells its story using non-traditional narrative techniques, intercutting the story-lines of the six different Dylan-inspired characters.
ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Daisy (Brittany Murphy) was being repeatedly molested by her father and may have enjoyed the attention. She was also diagnosed with resultant depression and OCD.  But here's how Wikipedia describes her:  "Daisy - A thin girl who is admitted to the hospital seasonally, according to Susanna, coming before Thanksgiving and staying through Christmas every year. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. She is addicted to laxatives and will only eat chicken, and only in her room. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it's time to leave the hospital, possibly due to obsessive compulsive disorder. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has incestuous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as "sexy" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward."    "Polly - Suffers from schizophrenia and depression. Polly has severe scarring on her left side. Before coming to the hospital, Polly had a pet that she developed an allergic rash to. She burned herself where the rash from the pet was in order to fix it so her mother wouldn't take away her pet. The other patients never ask her why she set herself on fire. According to Kaysen, this is because the sheer guts it took to actually do it means that Polly is very respected. Though she is calm and appears to have, in Kaysen's words, burned her troubles away, she does eventually break down."

ZyGyDLsDaa	Stay Alive (2006)  starring Frankie Muniz, Jon Foster, Samaire Armstrong, Milo Ventimiglia, Sophia Bush, Adam Goldberg  IMDb synopsis:  After the brutal death of a friend, a group of friends find themselves in possession of a video-game called "Stay Alive", a bloodcurdling story of a 17th century noblewoman known as the Blood Countess. After playing the game when they know they shouldn't, the friends realize that, once they die in the game, they die for real. As their numbers begin dropping, the remaining friends realize they must defeat the Blood Countess or accept their fates.    Here's the opening to the film:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HvBLbuYk...

V66j18Whaa	yes,of course!  i love both of those.  Ouran High School Host Club and Fruits Basket are two of my most favorite mangas/animes.  they're both romance comedy mangas,which is not all lovey-dovey all the time,but there is drama and comedy,too!  i like the Fruits Basket manga better than the anime though,since it's longer,and all characters are complete.  i'd give it a hundred stars.^_^|`|MuqtL8Baaa	Way better than the Anime version, it's far more appealing to me. The story line cause it's not as short as the Anime ones and more of a twist in Fruit Basket.  I give both 11.|`|s5LJjbDNaa	Ouran Host Club is worth reading but it's pretty hard to read if you don't have the books (some of the text is really tiny -_-) I liked the Japanese anime better.     Fruits Basket is alright, I wouldn't buy the books though because it's not as good after volume 3.    If you want to read them, this is a great website:  http://www.thespectrum.net/manga_scans/|`|RlqbhDplaa	10 stars for both of them.   I know that Ouran is WAY better than the anime. It has a whole lot more information and it's just awesome. It's funny and dramatic and entertaining.   Fruits Basket is the same, a whole lot more drama and story line. It's funny as well as dramatic. I haven't finished it yet, but it's been good so far.|`|1dI3ehiiaa	yes,yes, yes!:D read ouran high school host club!you wouldn't regret it xD it's so funny and great :D for ouran, 10 stars.xD about the fruits basket, i haven't read it yet but i'm planning to since they said that it's good ^^ i can't rate it yet, obviously =P|`|ivqfhzHXaa	definitely!! u should read it... i haven't read fruits basket, but i saw the anime it was amazing. i cried in like most of the episodes|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Yes, definately.    If you really like those romance-comedy type of manga, read Fruits Basket and Ouran High School Host Club. You can also try reading The Wallflower. A nice romance manga with a huge slap of comedy is good for any fan of manga. :)    I give it an infinity of stars. I really love Fruits Basket and Ouran.|`|tVvH28GCaa	Of course those manga are good, they're extremely popular!! No serious anime fan doesn't know what they are.    If you like those manga, you'll love these ones for sure. Plenty of romance, with comedy thrown in.|`|2ogFk4Amaa	I hear that it is a good manga.|`|f52eS7Ooaa	i like vampire knight/guilty, and loved the anime of ouran, plus have read the first 3 books of the manga. i thought the manga was good (even though the anime was slightly diffenent) . I would rate it a 10. I just love ouran :3  Fruit Basket i havent read before, but i've heard its kind childish.

POXOqhOYaa	Hey ?Ms. Misfit?  No, the +Anima manga is not shonen-ai, I haven't read it myself but my friends have and they never mentioned any boy on boy relationships.     Here's a bit of the plot.    he plot revolves around four +Anima children: Cooro, Husky, Senri, and Nana. Brought together by their +Anima powers, they search for others like themselves and a place to belong. Along the way, they encounter villains and friends alike, as well as other +Anima.  In the +Anima fantasy world, some humans have an unusual gift that grants them the ability to morph one or more of their body parts, such as limbs, into a form similar to an animal's body part. Some are capable of even more radical changes, such as growing wings or full-body transformation. The transformation processes are very fast, and occur at the user's will. When inactive, the morphed areas revert back to normal, leaving the person's clothing and body completely untouched. The only visual mark of this ability appears on the body of the person, in the form of a black tattoo-like marking. Occasionally, the user bears some behavioral characteristics of their animal, but this is not common.    By the way, the only way you can normally tell if a certain book is yaoi or not is by checking to see if it's wrapped in plastic because a plastic covered manga novel means there's sexual content in it which most yaoi, yuri and of course hentai have. Something tells me you aren't exactly looking for that.    Anyway I hope I helped you out and have a good day!     Later.|`|rFwdnpR9aa	No, the +Anima manga is not yaoi.|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|Tl9JSJOxaa	nope :D|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I have read the manga      There is no shoune-ai in this series.

Okane ga Nai is pretty good, too. Sukisyo doesn't have that much yaoi scenes but it can get you interested. Sensitive Pornograph is intense. xD    Enjoy~! :D    EDIT:    I forgot to mention, other yaoi animes that are slightly lighter are Loveless and Gravitation.|`|k5ugp7nRaa	i don't really watch or read that much yaoi but gakuen heaven was good  loveless was really good  and Gravitation but those were more shonen ai then anything it was ligth if you want something that really Intense ill ask my friend shes in to the Intense stuff im not|`|ucrGEybdaa	You can find Sensitive Pornograph here:     http://mesmerisz.livejournal.com/50273.h...    ;D

I do, however, seem to recall Lorelei telling Rory (repeated times) that she was in love with Luke. That was one of the great things about that show, though. The writers always managed to keep it realistic, and didn't give into those "big, romantic, corny-as-heck" love confession scenes. Gosh, I still can't believe the show got cancelled. Hope I helped. :)

But, so far, I have yet to see the correct answer. My only guess is maybe "Star Kid" from 1998--10 years ago, like you said. I've never seen this movie but you could tell me if this happens to be it, o.k.?  When a UFO lands near his house, shy seventh-grader Spencer Griffith (Joseph Mazzello) goes on an adventure that's way more exciting than his favorite comic book. Spencer jumps into an alien Cybersuit -- called "Cy" -- and completely transforms, getting back at school bullies and impressing Michelle (Lauren Eckstrom), the girl he likes. But when an enemy of the race that created Cy arrives on Earth, it's time for Spencer to take action.

The main couple get together and are boyfriend/girlfriend and dating for a long time during the series. They get married and have a child. Their romance is very long and when they become a couple they are devoted to each other and in a serious relationship. The main couple were princess and prince in the past and were reincarnated into the present. They have secret identities and after they are revealed they face many obstacles and become boyfriend/girlfriend and are dating and in a serious, committed relationship. They save the world and keep up a serious relationship at the same time and get engaged. After they get married, they become king and queen. There is a lot of magic, romance. The anime, manga and live action version are different.    Fushigi Yugi is a long series. The manga is a lot longer than the anime. The manga is 18 volumes and very long, while the anime ends a lot earlier, but has OVAs and is still very long. It's a fantasy/romance. The main character enters a new world, and gets a boyfriend who is her true love and protector. They must save the world together and they are boyfriend/girlfriend and in a serious relationship at the same time. Later on, after the first arc, the manga and the OVAs cover the next part where the main character's boyfriend and true love becomes the main character. The second part is a lot longer in the manga, but the OVAs in the anime do cover part of it, but you must watch the OVAs in order to get the full story, though the manga is a lot longer. It's magical, romantic, fantasy. It has it all. I'll explain more later.    Ceres Celestial Legend is a good series. The manga is a lot better than the anime. The anime cuts out a lot of the manga. The series is dark, romantic and has a lot of action. The main character's boyfriend/lover is fighting for the other side and the main character's life is in danger. During the manga, which the anime doesn't cover, the main character's boyfriend takes her to hotel rooms where they spend intimate nights together, but they have to avoid being caught by those tracking them down. The manga has some tastefully done sex scenes, to warn you.    Stellvia of the Universe is romance/action.    Ah! My Goddess has romance/action.    Ultra Maniac is romance/magic with some action.    Ayashi no Ceres the manga has lots of romance/action. The anime changes a lot. The manga has lots of kissing all the time, lots of action, lots of drama, some sex, the anime is a lot darker and cuts out a lot of the sweeter, lighter parts of the story. The manga is better, but choose whatever you want.     Shakugan no Shana  Fate/Stay night  Chrno Crusade  Mai-HiME  Mai-Otome  Full Metal Panic!
0ad3907cd576bb2822742362e66c77c0aa	Well, the diseases are real diseases. I don't remember seeing one that was actually made up just for the sake of the show. However, if you are asking if that's the way the doctors figure out if that's what the patient actually has, I have no clue. I'm sure the techniques are legit and they do have medical advisers that work on the show, so I'm sure most of the stuff is based on real life.
VoFFpD49aa	Lana Lang first appeared in Superboy issue  10 back in 1950 they where childhood friends / sweethearts. If I remember she knew early on that Clark had superhuman abilities. When Clark decided to leave Smallville for Metropolis he wanted her to go w/ him but she refused...they haven't seen each other for decades. When Superman's deeds became known through out Metropolis Lana knew it was Clark.   Lex was following Superman's appearances and he happened upon Lana visiting Clark at his apartment one day. He kidnapped her and tortured her...thinking she had information about Superman she told him nothing and returned to Smallville. Lana learned about Lois & Clark and eventually married Pete Ross since she knew that Clark had found his 'true love.'  I've never known Lana and Lex as husband and wife in the comics...why would she, after he tourted her?....but hell he tourted her in the TV series, and they married, why not just carry on the tradition.|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	Yes, she was Clark Kent's high school friend. Kinda like Gwen Stacy was to Peter Parker (spider-man), before Mary Jane came along (movie stories are never right). The thing is though, Lana Lang was white with red hair. lol. And Clark Kents best friend, Peter Ross, is white (in the tv series smallville he's black). Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be rascist (I myself am Asian), but the fact is the shows creators obviously changed these characters to try to please the multicultural world.|`|HhpRxYSLaa	Yes, she was Clark's high school sweetheart.    They don't end up together though.

zUhYQyUNaa	whether she intended to or not that is racist.|`|kHY0eMVraa	What did she do that was racist?|`|pbVPS24zaa	I do not think that it "just" faces. In fact I am outrage. Cut the bull everyone. If I said cracker or the n word all you white and blacks would be offended. Since when did Asian people have no feelings about this. I want a FULL apology not a I was just kidding. I think you should not say she is a child. Technically she isn't, she is almost a young adult. I hope she gets a effed up life cause she deserves it! Yes, I said it. If anyone wants to argue with me why bother? I'M JUST A KID. Yea heard that saying before haven't you? Remember us Asians created 90% of your clothing and household items.|`|TCECDZxxaa	seriously? she made a funny face at the camera, i do that all the time. big freakin deal she pulled out her eyes, OHH MY GOSH THE HORROR!! SHES SO RACIST, SUCH A BAD ROLE MODEL, SHE IS SO HORRIBLE!!!!! I THINK IM GONNA CRY    haha NO, she is a really good role model. totally sweet and honest, so do i have a problem with the silly pics she takes, hell no. its her life HER PRIVATE LIFE which we shouldnt judge, shes cool and talented. i like her music and show, and her. her pics are funny and typical 16 year old girl stuff. no biggie, i think there are more problems in the world than miley making a goofy face to the camera...      people take racism to far, they abuse it. if you knew anything about miley you would no one of her best friends, brenda song, is asian. i dont think she is racist and i dont think the face she made was discrimanating to asians. i think people are making a big deal out of nothing, as usual in her case|`|HkIatVdiaa	she was just making faces!!! seriously, its pathetic to turn something so small into something so big. She can tell you that yourself, HERE:    Miley Cyrus is finally speaking out on controversial photos that show her using her fingers to make her eyes slant, which is considered degrading to Asian people.    "I've also been told there are some people upset about some pictures taken of me with friends making goofy faces! Well, I'm sorry if those people looked at those pics and took them wrong and out of context!" she writes on her official fansite.    "In NO way was I making fun of any ethnicity! I was simply making a goofy face. When did that become newsworthy?" she adds. "It seems someone is trying to make something out of nothing to me. If that would of [sic] been anyone else, it would of been overlooked! I definitely feel like the press is trying to make me out as the new 'BAD GIRL'!"    Cyrus continues: "I feel like now that Britney is back on top of her game again, they need someone to pick on! Lucky me! haha Anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know what is on my heart. You guys know me and have been by my side every step of the way!    "You guys know my heart and know the most important things to me are my friends, family, fans, and GOD! In NO WAY do I want to disappoint any of you! But, when I have made mistakes in the past, I feel like I've owned up to them and apologized," she adds.    "I really wish everyone would stop focusing on my personal life and get back to focusing on what I love! Music and Acting! Hopefully, I will be touring again this fall! Yayy! =] It will be a nice change to be back out on the road again!" Cyrus goes on, before signing off "bexoxo blessings...Miley =)"    Advocate group OCA released a statement earlier saying the 16 year old "encouraged and legitimized the taunting and mocking of people of Asian descent, [and] she has also insulted her many Asian Pacific American fans."    This isn't the first time Cyrus has been slammed for photos.    In April 2008, she was criticized by parenting groups after pictures surfaced of her posing in green bra. A few months later, she apologized after posing semi-nude in Vanity Fair.|`|MIrhJowHaa	I dont think it was right for her to do that.  I know, she was just having fun. But still, you don't make fun of Asians. I don't care if she was trying to be funny, it really wasn't. She should know better than that. I just hope she apologized! That girl needs to get herself together, before her career goes down the pipes! You don't make fun of people who are a different race than you are. It makes you sound racist, even if you aren't. She should know better than that!|`|5707339fb54432034d12ac39ea99ebd9aa	if Miley said the N word, would black people get offended?    I am OFFENDED because small gestures like this can erupt into huge racial injustice.  People have given me these "eyes" and it is insulting and humiliating.  Being called a chinaman is also insulting.  If people let this slide, society will think it is acceptable.  I may be PC, but I am speaking out, I am tired of people saying it is not a big deal.|`|g7fl3II7aa	Think about it people. Many people say to leave her alone b/c she is a child. Yes, she is a child but one that makes millions from her popularity. She is a child that many kids look up to. If you don't want the responsibility of being a role model then you shouldn't be there.     I think most people that say that this is no big deal are white. Think about, are you saying that Asians have goofy faces? If everyone was supposed to make "goofy" faces, then why is the Asian guy just sitting there? If a picture came out where she paints her face black, would everyone say the same thing?     Those that do say that she was just making a goofy face...do me a favor...walk around making that face and see what kind of reaction you will get.    I do agree that she is young and hence immature but is that an excuse? So if you are young, you are allowed to do these kind of things?     I ask one question...If your child went around making these "goofy" faces, would you tell them to stop or would you just say "no big deal"?

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Accusing your best bud of sleeping with your boyfriend is low down and awful. I can't stand Audrina. She was just trying to create fake drama to get some more air time. You're missing the whole point of why Lauren accused Heidi of spreading the sex tape rumor. Brody, who was Spencer's best friend, CONFIRMED that it was Spencer and Heidi who did the deed. Lauren knew she had a trustworthy source whereas Audrina was going by fake rumors. Audrina is pathetic. She is just another silicon implanted fake, low IQ idiot. She would be nothing without jumping on Lauren's coattails.

I love Todd (Trevor) i think he's played it wonderfully. and i totally get the "little boy" thing you're talking about too. when he and Marty were up on the roof and Marty completely broke his heart you could see the hurt and anguish in his eyes, he was so on the verge of tears but didn't cry, but OMG his face! i've said this before but ill say it again, he's like a puppy! a very cute, sad little puppy you just want to take home and take care of!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I agree with you!

556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	1) Have actually happened in fields, but are usually well-planned hoaxes, stunts that is...    2) I've actually *ran into* a couple of things that would qualify as poltergeists, so I'm not the best one to ask about this.    3) Sure, since the acronym just means *Unidentified Flying Object*.  Sometimes comets and meteors pass into this category, as do some military aircraft.    4) Myth, and/or complete and utter hoax.  I don't have cable, don't watch the Disney Channel, and am convinced, for the most part, that too many young people have been *snookered* by some sort of infomercial.  ^__^  That eventually, the Jonas Bros. will be laughed at the way KFC bowls, Rory Emerald, and Chuck Norris jokes are now.    5) Odds are people found some fossils once, made up stories and now things have gone completely crazy.  Primates *very much* like Bigfoot did exist once--they were upright, walking apes called Australopithecus.  National Geographic magazine even did a computer rendered cover of one, based on fossil evidence; I saw that and was like, "Ok, there's Bigfoot right there."  So yeah, people found some bones, some footprints maybe, and like with the crop circles, they just ran with it a little bit too far.

IVy35SE2aa	If the female really loves sex then the relationship should do very well in that department.  You may well find him too emotional, possessive,  and controlling to tolerate for a very long relationship.  It will be great until the newness wears off.|`|lpyWVR2oaa	Basically, you two fit each other like a pair of gloves, since you are both inherently water in elemental makeup. There would be no problems in understanding each other's innermost core essence and emotional needs/desires. Plus having both moons in cancer means you will intuitively understand each other - no words required.    The only conflicts i see now and then are minor and can certainly be ovecome by the stronger aspects in the charts. Your Ascendants, Mars and Venuses are working in cross-purpose to each other, indicating that when it comes to social behavior, aesthetic tastes in friends, music etc, initiation drives, both of you may rub each other the wrong way every now and then.    On the plus side, one side's Venus in Aquarius conjuncts the other's Mars, indicating that there will be no lack of sexual attraction on both parts. You attract each other through unconventional intellectual exchange of words and ideas.    It is important to realize that some aspects of both your personalities combined can cause friction every now and then so its important to give each other space and time alone at times. Other than that, this pairing looks fundamentally sound and very promising.

Then they meet me.  just kidding!  I'm not that full of myself.    Americans have an opinion about the rest of the World too.  It is - What rest of the World? Another stereotype lol!    I am an American, of course. :)|`|lEjYhwxkaa	yes|`|7y7t04Vsaa	Yes. There is nothing wrong with Americans in general. There is some nice ones and some asshole ones, just like with all people.    And you look like a friend of mine from when I was back in high school!|`|IuM7rz5Daa	yes!  and most of the haters end up moving here  i was watching wifeswap, and the french husband kept slamming america, even though he lived here. i was like wtheck?!|`|CYhOr4s7aa	yup to hell with all the people that don't like the USA  take your *** back home to that 3rd and 4th world country you live at then|`|fbbb1919a6be870cfe6b62811bef94cbaa	They're all a bunch of douche bags.
T1sJxnwOaa	no, i cried when that old lady dumped the giant diamond into the ocean. WTF!?!|`|ABAcvFVbaa	omg yeas when jack dies omg i was sad when rose was jack jack wake up and he didnt omg so sad|`|2n1PbzbRaa	That scene makes me mad. And I never get mad. Im being totally serious here. These are the reasons.    (1) HELLO! There was totally room for two on that door that Rose was floating on. I mean come on Rose, what is your problem, I know that you and Jack could have found an intelligent way to get up on that door. Besides, trying and trying again would get your blood moving and warm you guys up!    (2) Jack, you are such a wuss. How can you let that selfish rich girl live while you die. I know you love her and all, but everyone has these things called survival instincts. Where are yours? You're too nice and Rose is selfish. You shouldn't have died, and Rose shouldn't have pushed you off like that. Meanie.|`|8e4e5525d4c996bd34b95f4a6c4ef68daa	yea i think she is dying too :( but yea i cried|`|xzNNVRbPaa	NOT EVENNNN|`|0utZQuyeaa	"Cried" is an understatement. I bawled my fricken' eyes out for like 10 minutes straight- no joke.  & My sister was staring at me like... Get a grip. Its just a movie.    Yeah. But a SAD one!      Good question :DD|`|379833cdc0fd6cb60406f36faec52d3aaa	i always cry too...  sometimes wen you watch that movie its like "will somene ever love me like he did her?"  and someone did.  but i still cry when i watch it.  its my favorite love movie.|`|14gi4aTvaa	Not exactly but I felt sooo horrible ]:|`|tT6GMdHiaa	YES lmao like a baby  thats one of my all time favorites idc its a classic|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	I think that is the most ludicrous scene in one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Both of them could've fit on the raft or they could've taken turns but neither of them had to die.|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	Me too! But I didn't cry the first time I saw the movie, because I was 4. I was like, "Mum, why won't he get up?" and my mum just goes, "Er..he's a lazy bugger."|`|y6406A92aa	Nope..|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Um yes, but you can't blame me. I was pregnant at the time, hormones and all. Well a part of it could have been from happiness that the movie WAS FINALLY almost over.|`|h00bqU7baa	Yes...|`|TOZwBsnQaa	the first time i watched that movie was when i found out my cat had died.     it was like god was trying to double team me to make me cry, which i did.|`|uJskRjP7aa	Yes!!! Every time i watch that movie i cry so hard and in those particular scenes as well. Just like you! When they meet up again at the end and he's waiting for her at the clock, gets me every time.|`|rabjcdjHaa	Yes, I cry every time I watch Titanic! I hate that Jack dies! It's so sad! My favorite part of the movie is when Jack and Rose reunite at the end! I cry every time I see that part! That was a great ending!|`|bvt9kvS8aa	YESSS    why did sexy jack have to diee?|`|SJwRbuBHaa	me too..every time. No matter how many times I watch it. Same with the notebook.    I cried today on Bones, when Booth was kidnapped by the grave digger, and at the end they reunited.  "tears"|`|NNki7qiFaa	Yup.|`|SZPZ40QAaa	No.|`|1INJGkw9aa	Nope.|`|27eXzL84aa	I thoughts he went swimming and made it out alive|`|e1adb1e6bf7618d36ecfea10a335a315aa	Yes I did....it was a good movie and I know lots of people trash the movie now but I will always LOVE IT.|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	yes!  I cried for like ten minutes about it.  and yeah when she died when she's old made me soooo sad!  that made me cry for another 5 minutes|`|94f2e9870489240e3ded1e33b5c2940baa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! most definitely!|`|NXSwMfyeaa	I cried when Rose was going "Jack! Jack! Jack!" and he wouldn't wake up...and then when she was calling for somebody to find her after Jack sank...before she found the whistle of course :p|`|mS3Bhc3xaa	nope not really.  i didn't like Rose's character so i didn't feel bad for her.  and it's not like Jack suffered or anything. he was dead. :/|`|DlMsJPwUaa	Ive never been able to make it past the 2nd hour|`|DZSQNEBjaa	I cried, I can watch that movie 100 times and still cry at that scene lol|`|odgjRL8Eaa	I cried the first time I saw it, after that, it still made me sad, but i didn't cry.

I start off small then end up pulling a Ralph Waldo Emerson.|`|yWrwDSDLaa	Yea. Sometimes its the other way around though, too xD|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Yes. I hate that.|`|7nTJKhW6aa	o i hate when that happens|`|DjCLWseZaa	No, I like long answers, which is why I'm about to give you a reason to answer yes to your own poll. That, and I like to annoy people. I think long answers are fantastic, as long as they are relevant. I hate just getting yes or no answers. If I want a short answer, I say so in my question. I think that long answers show that the answeree actually cares enough to think about the question and take time to help the person. I don't think they are as long as books, though. I've only really exceeded the character limit once, and that wasn't even using the source section to continue my answer. I am usually grateful for long answers and, in the event that there are two equal answers, I will award best answer to the person that spent more time. I'm sorry for annoying you by writing this "book" length answer, but I'm bored and have no life. Hmm, Wonder how many thumbs down I'll get. I bet some jerk will report me for no reason. Meanies! Please let my answer live. The people who skip a million lines just to make you scroll do annoy me though. Good bye. See you later (if you don't block me for annoying you to death.)

Perhaps because of my OCD traits, where I have compulsions to do everything perfectly - such as not leave any answers out when answering someone's question.    Maybe because I just LOVE writing.    I can't tell you how tempted I am to turn this into a book.    But such would contradict the nature of this question.    So I'll end it here :)|`|vW9qF5lSaa	Yes, but I'm also very guilty of DOING that.

When I hire someone at my offices, I always wonder what amazing reasons why a person will say that they are applying for my open positions.  I respect an honest person, one who knows that if I were to award them with a job, that they know that money is on the line.    My top answers I like to hear.  1.  I need a job to make some money.  2.  I need to provide for my family.   3.  I need to make a living.  4.  I need a job that provides me with benefits like insurance, a 401k or retirement plan.  5.  I want a job that I can stay with until I retire.  6.  I want to become a professional.    There is no shame in asking about money, benefits and retirement.  Make sure to ask them specific questions about the pay scale.  Don't forget the big reason on why we all work.  We have bills, wants and needs.  This takes money and a job is how you decided to earn it!    Good Luck!  And I wish you all the best!|`|CmNSdnWIaa	I usually put down because I need the money,but then again,I don't have a job either so maybe that's not a good idea,ha ha.|`|4onMCULuaa	Um your interested in what they do.You want to learn that type of buisiness or work.Pay attension to what the co. is about.If they need certain skills from people that you have.Use that as a tool and your basis for wanting the job and that is why you would be a valued employee.Just make sure you sell yourself the best you can.Dont say because you need money.thats the worst thing you can do.It makes you sound desperate and employers dont like that.Look up joe turner.com.Hes the job search guy.Theres a lot of info there.Best i got.|`|a8UX1tHLaa	Wrong section..

I love The Beatles.|`|sKUb0BOBaa	The Beatles were my first true love. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' or 'Eight Days A Week' always put a smile on my face.|`|XOnSRoR2aa	I have so much affection for the Beatles. Their music is more meaningful to me than anyone else's because it has been such a part of my life from literally the day I was born when my parents had "Abbey Road" playing in the hospital room. It almost feels like a friend I've known for so long and have shared all these experiences with because so many of my memories are attached to their music. "Hey Jude" makes me laugh and thinking of my dad singing it when I was little. "Here Comes The Sun" brings me peace because it's the song that came on my ipod the moment before I found out my great-grandmother had passed away, and I felt a tremendous calm and sense of assurance that she was in a better place and that all was going to be alright. "Clarabella" makes me smile and think of my aunt who was named after the little-known song. "Eleanor Rigby" makes my heart ache for the lonely people of the world. (And btw, there is an awesome book by the same name by Douglas Coupland that I highly recommend).     "All You Need is Love" makes my heart sing. My youngest sister was born in London on the day of the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, and shortly after her birth the festivities were kicked off by all the countries in the Commonwealth singing the song in unison. There were huge screens up in Hyde Park, and people from Australia to South Africa to Canada and all over London were singing the song, and I will forever remember being in the room watching it from the set while holding her for the first time.     And "I want to hold your hand" makes me think of my boyfriend. : )    ~ Pax / Peace|`|VzIWDuRzaa	"I want to hold your hand"|`|bhc7HuN9aa	yes.

41mwqPuPaa	It would be cool if they made a song together with Dr. Dre on Detox. But without Ross.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	that would be cool!|`|3cHAFBF7aa	i dont think so...eventually 50 & game will start dissing eachother again. those guys cant get along! no matter what Game said|`|m2vBJaHKaa	id rather have them together makign good music again then listening to this Lil Wayne bullshit on the radio|`|PA7ryYR8aa	Game just cant seem to keep 50s name out of his mouth, this will never end...but i think if game were to go after 50 right now, 50 would destroy him.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	I'm pretty sure they still hate each other and I'm pretty sure that they'll ALWAYS hate each other.  But like someone else said, if they did a song together or "Detox", that'd be amazing.    The 50 Cent vs. Rick Ross beef will definitely not end up being the next "Biggie vs. 2pac".  Big and Pac were both decent rappers who were both relevant in their respective cities.  Rick Ross is not a good rapper, nor does he have any real importance.  I knew the first time I ever saw Rick Ross, I said, "This is guy is fake".  If you haven't noticed, 50 Cent loves destroying the careers of terrible rappers.  And I don't blame him, it makes him look like 10x the MC that he really is.    Now a 50 Cent/Lil Wayne beef....  That might be a bit bigger.  Seeing as Lil Wayne seems to be "America's Favorite Rapper" at the moment and if he got absolutely destroyed lyrically, I'd be curious to see how some people would react.  Plus, I'd like to see what the internet hip-hop community would think.  I'd say a majority of the internet hip-hop community hates 50 Cent, but I'd say a bigger majority of them hate Lil Wayne more.  So who's side would they take?|`|Md48G2g9aa	I really hope so but i doubt it   I think it will go on for a little bit but i don't think it or i know it wont be anywhere near as big as biggie or tupac because neither one is comparable to big or pac and if you mean about violence nah it aint that serious.

They are nothing but a bunch of pretty boys who get by on their boyish looks because their music is bland like a mayonnaise sandwich.  The only time they look decent is on Ellen DeGeneres Show, and that's because Ellen knows how to class up dowdy guests.  Not much cred in their favor, if you ask me.|`|21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	I do, I think that it's ridiculous that they were in Rolling Stone magazine.

wA8Dyhq7aa	I think Tracy's got a little more "twang" to his voice than Don had, but there's a similar range there.    I love Homer & Jethro's parody of "Oh, Lonesome Me."

The vanity fair picture she had a bra on under the blanket.  She's never been caught with drugs either.  Disney would never kick her out, she makes them waaay too much money.|`|u70ecVvBaa	i actually dont hate her. so im glad that she hasnt been kicked off disney channel. and if you hate her soo much, then stop watching disney channel!|`|BNYBKbNoaa	1. she hasn't been caught with drugs OR nude pics.  2. nobody's perfect and i think it's good that she is honest with her mistakes. she doesn't pretend to be perfect. she's 16 and no one should expect her to be perfect.  3. shes funny and the biggest money maker on disney so of course they wont kick her.|`|V5AliBPMaa	I like her, but the reason that they haven't kicked her out is probably because shes their money machine. And shes not that bad when you actually take time to think about it, its just pictures. Who cares. If it was any one else like a normal person no one could care less because shes famous and 10 year olds are looking up to her doesn't mean she has to fake everything she does and shes not even half as bad as people I know that are younger than her. And shes never been cought with drugs so I dont know what you have been smoking and there are disney people that have had way worce pictures than her because in hers she wasn't actually naked or showing any thing bad.|`|j5y1pONfaa	I actually like watching Hannah Montana. The new "scandal" with her posing with her squinting eyes is ridiculous. People make big deals over nothing. The more sh*t they try to pull on her the more I like her.|`|AA10146695	she has never been caught with drugs or nude pics. you don't know what you are talking about.and Disney will not kick her out because they are making mega bucks off of Hannah Montana and Miley is very popular. but i do agree she is a bad influence and i think that she gives  kids bad examples. but she is only human, people make mistakes.|`|fbKVq6Znaa	okay not one of my favorite people but for once im really going to answer a miley question with an unbiased opinion like i should    honestly i think miley is actually a pretty good role model. i mean what she does is nothing compared to what everyone i knew did at age 13. and when was she ever caught with drugs. until that day comes i dont think she's a bad kid. and when she does make mistakes, she accepts her punishments and resumes her responsibilities properly. and what most teens dont do is exactly that. many will go to great lengths to cover up their actions. miley almost always gives out a formal apology to the press which has got to take alot of guts for an embaressed 16 year old girl whose focus is probably on her career and social life. and i think she works hard despite the fact that her father is also a musician. she probably works harder than him. i bet she makes more money than him too. anyway my point is, that miley cyrus is relatively a decent teen (one who is at the prime of her life at such a young age mind you) and she shouldnt be reprimanded so much. she really hasnt done anything so atrocious that we must continue to pollute Y!A with more disney star questions. okay be shocked about for a minute or two then get over it. we were all sixteen once. when we took part in normal teenager things did we believe we were committing crimes?|`|uFBXM4rIaa	what the heck? she has never been caught with drugs or entirely nude.

8HtC4j33aa	Butterfly Kisses.   Bob Carlisle     There's two things I know for sure:  She was sent here from heaven and she's  daddy's little girl.  As I drop to my knees by her bed at night  She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes and  I thank god for all the joy in my life  Oh, but most of all  For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer;  sticking little white flowers all up in her  hair; "Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride."  "I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried."  In all that I've done wrong I know I must  have done something right to deserve a hug  every morning and butterfly kisses at night.    Sweet 16 today  She's looking like her mama a little more everyday  One part woman, the other part girl.  To perfume and make-up from ribbons and curls  Trying her wings out in a great big world.    But I remember  Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer; sticking  little white flowers all up in her hair.  "You know how much I love you, Daddy, But if you  don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time."  With all that I've done wrong I must have done  something right to deserve her love every morning  and butterfly kisses at night.    All the precious time  Like the wind, the years go by.  Precious butterfly.  Spread your wings and fly.    She'll change her name today.  She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.  Standing in the bride-room just staring at her.  She asked me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not  sure-I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl."  She leaned over...gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there,  Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair  "Walk my down the aisle, Daddy-it's just about time."  "Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry!"    Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have  done something right.  To deserve your love every morning and butterfly  kisses-I couldn't ask God for more, man this is what love is.    I know I gotta let her go, but I'll always remember  every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses.|`|jqbS2KW0aa	"You Know Where To Find Me" by matthew west.    really? ok...

Chorus:  Give me your eyes for just one second  Give me your eyes so I can see  Everything that I keep missing  Give me your love for humanity  Give me your arms for the broken hearted  Ones that are far beyond my reach.  Give me your heart for the ones forgotten  Give me your eyes so I can see  Yeah  Yeah    Step out on a busy street  See a girl and our eyes meet  Does her best to smile at me  To hide what's underneath  There's a man just to her right  Black suit and a bright red tie  Too ashamed to tell his wife  He's out of work  He's buying time  All those people going somewhere  Why have I never cared?    Chorus    I've Been there a million times  A couple of million eyes  Just moving past me by  I swear I never thought that I was wrong  Well I want a second glance  So give me a second chance  To see the way you see the people all along    Chorus (x2)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	The Drifters - " This magic Moment "|`|8Zcu55Braa	The Man Who Can't Be Moved by The Script     .....Going back to the corner where I first saw you,  Gonna camp in my sleeping bag.

After thinking for a minute he hands her a pin and tells her that whenever he looks at her when he is preaching, she should poke him with it.  Well, Sunday rolls around and the preacher is up front preaching. After a while he decides to see if the congregation is listening and asks a simple question, "Who created the world?" He looks at the woman and she pokes her husband with the pin.  He awakes with a start and exclaims, "God!"  "Right!" says the preacher.  A little while later he decides to test the audience again, "Who is God's son?" Again he looks at the woman and she pokes him again.  "Jesus!" he exclaims.  "Right again!" says the pastor, and continues preaching.  Later in the sermon the preacher decides to tell a joke, to liven things up a bit, "What did Eve say to Adam after their tenth child?" Forgetting what he told the woman, he accidentally looks at her and she pokes her husband with the pen.  He wakes up and yell, "If you poke me with that thing again, I'm gonna break it in half and shove it up your a**!"|`|eUiMXcFcaa	What's better than roses on a piano?

It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent.    SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants.    SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.    SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most! What can we do?    SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.    SM: It's not working.    SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing. He started to walk faster, too.    SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.    SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both.    So the man decided to follow Sister Logical.        Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to Sister Logical.    Then Sister Logical arrives.    SM: Sister Logical ! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!    SL : The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both,so he followed me    SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?    SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could and he started to run as fast as he could.    SM: And?    SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me    SM: Oh, dear! What did you do?    SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.    SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do?    SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.    SM: Oh, no! What happened then?    SL: Isn't it logical, Sister?  A nun with her dress up can run faster than man with his pants down.

Abby was already telling her grandmother that Phyllis sent Noah when she shouldn't have and that Brad died saving Noah.  Sharon will blame Phyllis for sending Brad after her at the cabin.  Colleen and Ashley may blame Victor for threatening Brad.  So there will be a lot of blame to go around.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i think colleen will blame abby and victor for brad's death. i think colleen was alot closer to brad than abby was too|`|ow1m3c8jaa	It seems to me there will be alot of blame going around for Brad's death.    Yesterday Colleen yelled at Victor for leaving the nasty message on Brad's phone threatening him if he didn't resign from the board, so I think she will blame Victor rather than Noah & Eden.    Abby already said on the phone today that if Eden hadn't talked Noah into going skating on the lake, her father (Brad) will still be alive, so I think she will end up in a cat fight with Eden before long.  Abby may also blame Victor for the way he's treated Brad, but since Abby's probably still into money so much, I doubt that will last too long.    Sharon will no doubt blame herself for turning Brad away like she did at the cabin after he drove all the way up to the cabin in the snowstorm just to tell her he truly loves her.    Phyllis has already blamed herself not only for allowing Noah to go with Eden, but also for sending Brad to the cabin after Sharon.  Sharon will no doubt go after Phyllis and blame her for the whole thing.      My guess is that Ashley won't be too happy with Victor's actions towards Brad lately either, especially since she's now heard the message that Victor left for him and how upset She and Abby are over Brad's death.    I also suspect that Phyllis maybe right and Nick will blame her for Brad's death since again she pushed Brad to go after Sharon.  This could also be enough to send Nick packing, but according to some of the spoilers going around they'll work it out, so time will tell on that one.|`|502de2cc3792d16d3d9fb9314dac8743aa	Definitely! Colleen's been such witch for a while now but she did seem genuinely sincere in her grief for Brad and i felt really bad for her because JT's married to Victoria now and she didn't have anyone else... hopefully someone will come to her side!    And i agree with everything JohnAnn said about all the blame to go around...|`|CyVxolNHaa	who will turn on who? why will they i think the only one that will be pointing fingers there is Abby to Eden, other than that, i d think anyone else have that right to  point blame on anyone.    Actually i take that back, I do see alot others will be pointing fingers, like Phyllis will be blaming Sharon, as usual, and Noah will be blamed by who? I d k yet, and well Victor is already being blamed , so i guess there will be alot of ppl being blamed for Brad's death!
rYA2KCnUaa	I think she will eventually put two and two together because after her daughter Abby had heard Victor grilled her dad into the rut, Abby is going to questioned Victor why did he banished her father Brad like that.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't think so. After hearing about that phone call that Victor left Brad on his answering machine she still thinks she can figure Victor out. I don't understand how anyone can be so blind?  She should know by now that she has been hurt by him several times in the past and that no one will ever have his heart like Nicky. Someway, somehow I think they will end up back together.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i doubt it cause love is blind. but, i think that abby will want to move now. i don't think colleen will want to though.
d9c0f5c5286294dcbb5ab28de65e8c39aa	Yes especially after hearing that phone msg. I expected ashley to show more greif but she didn't. I think she blames victor and eden for what happened to brad

BtDGWKSNaa	Henry Ford Goes To Heaven  Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the gates, an angel tells Ford, "Well, you've been such a good guy and your invention (the assembly line for the automobile) changed the world. As a reward, you can hang out with anyone you want to in Heaven."    Ford thinks about it and says, "I want to hang out with God, Himself."    The befeathered fellow at the Gate takes Ford to the Throne Room and introduces him to God.    Ford then asks God, "Hey, aren't you the inventor of Woman?"    God replies, "Ah, yes."    "Well," says Ford, "You have some major design flaws in your invention:  1. there's too much front end protrusion  2. it chatters at high speeds  3. the rear end wobbles too much, and  4. the intake is placed too close to the exhaust."    "Hmmm...." Replies God, "hold on." God goes to the Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the result. The computer prints out a slip of paper and God reads it. "It may be that my invention is flawed," God replies to Henry Ford, "but according to the computer, more men are riding my invention than yours."      The Queen of England    The queen of England was visiting one of Canada's top hospitals, and during her tour of the floors she passed a room where a male patient was masturbating. "Oh my god!", said the Queen, "That's disgraceful, what is the meaning of this?!" The doctor leading the tour explains, "I'm sorry your ladyship, this man has a very serious condition where the testicles rapidly fill with semen. If he doesn't do that five times a day, they would explode and he would most likely die instantly." "Oh, I am sorry" said the Queen.      On the next floor they passed a room where a young nurse was giving a patient a ********.??"Oh my God", said the Queen, "What's happening in there?"      The Doctor replied, "Same problem, better health plan."          Sperm Bank Robbery    A man wearing a mask bursts into a sperm bank with a shot gun. "Open the ******* safe!" he yells at the girl behind the counter. "But we're not a real bank" replies the girl. "This is a sperm bank, we don't hold money". "Don't argue just open the safe or I'll blow your ******* head off!" She obliges and opens the safe door.    "Take one of the bottles and drink it!"    "But it's full of sperm" the girl replies nervously.    "Don't argue, just drink it" he says. She forced off the cap and gulps it down.    "Take out another one and drink it too!" he demands. The girl drinks another one. Suddenly the guy pulls off the mask and to the girl's amazement it's her husband..  "not that ******* difficult, is it?" he says.    "Indian Ride  An attractive woman from New York was driving through a remote part of Texas when her car broke down. An American Indian on horseback came along and offered her a ride to a nearby town. She climbed up behind him on the horse and they rode off. The ride was uneventful, except that every few minutes the Indian would let out a "Ye-e-e-e ha-a-a-a" so loud that it echoed from the surrounding hills. When they arrived in town, he let her off at the local service station, yelled one final "Ye-e-e-e ha-a-a-a!" and rode off.    "What did you do to get that Indian so excited?" asked the service-station attendant.    "Nothing. I merely sat behind him on the horse, put my arms around his waist, and held onto the saddle horn so I wouldn't fall off," the woman answered.    "Lady," the attendant said, "Indians ride bareback."|`|GvLFP2b6aa	Lol  Like em all  (Reffering to yours and Abby S's)|`|vgcY5jHuaa	There's a christmas tree with 3 ornaments.  Two other people come by and one shoots one. He says: "Ha! I shot your ornament! Now it's not 'ho ho ho!', it's just, 'ho ho!'  So he fires again, and says, \"'now you have just ONE 'ho!'"  The guy with him says: I'd like to have just one ho. Bow Chicka Wow Wow!

bZe2bSMdaa	Actually unless it's a really substantial quake I just assume it's a truck nearby or a neighbor on the stairs. The only tell tale sound in the place would be the sound of rattling glass in the curio cabinets and china closet.    I don't very often realize it's an earthquake until someone calls and asks "did you feel that?" It's usually my roomie's Mother!    We had one a couple of weeks ago and my roomie had been really sick, I thought she had passed out and hit the floor! I ran upstairs to see if she was alright and she said it was an earthquake! Sure enough, a few minutes later her Mom called to see if we had felt it!|`|NfwJPdLjaa	Nope. I live in Lincoln Nebraska.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I've stopped caring.    Now it feels just as normal as rain.    But I can usually tell when my pets simultaneously start freaking out.|`|14gi4aTvaa	Pfft earthquakes... they're so overrated. They always got to be up in our business.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I live in California so earthquakes happen quite a bit by me.  If i hear my dogs playing in their dog house which is right next to our house, I think there's an earthquake.  In fact, the last earthquake we had, I thought that it was the dogs playing around.  Also, if I hear anything rattling, or shaking, I think there's an earthquake.    EDIT:  Also one of our cats starts to act really strange because she hates loud noises or any kind of shaking.  She can usually feel it before us.|`|2N4j1ficaa	not relay but we do have only small  earthquakes in uk  but  lots of them  its only when they are local we feel them... but have you noticed that the birds don't sing just before or straight after ?|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Yes. I have a few. The rattling windows, and especially the ceiling fans. I have four ceiling fans in my house, They usually sway a bit, or the blades will move.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Nope I live in the Northeast.  We get blizzards/noreasters and leftover hurricanes.|`|60aa2c1f0300ff1e992f1bde00c32822aa	~~ At times yes, like when a truck drives by and shakes the ground ~~?|`|DhUMjZxtaa	I live in Toronto, Ontario (Canada) and we don't have earthquakes. I think we only get the after shocks of other earthquakes which in that case we never feel them, expect once I did, for a few seconds it was kinda weird but its not like anything was shaking in my house.|`|0NQL7yRPaa	no|`|c8qgyBgsaa	No. we dont really get anything. I live in like the middle of the country. lol.  we dont even get tornados very often like 1 or 2 a year.|`|OPKbGXUFaa	Hahha, we've only had 1 earthquake in the past decade, and that was in 2001,    soo, to answer your question, no.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	I live in California and no I do not know what you are talking about    EDIT  ok now it makes sense, honestly nothing significant, The ones I remember happened when I was really young, the last one I was in the shower and another before that I was in bed.|`|jAAWM3Kyaa	Nope I didn't hear the Earthquake coming|`|W5ITQuqFaa	Only when Rosie O` Donnell visits...|`|94f2e9870489240e3ded1e33b5c2940baa	no chance of an earthquake in NE louisiana...not likely...lol    i do worry when they have hurricanes headed this way though|`|8UcMR12haa	theres earthquakes where i live, alot of them, and funny enough i can't recall any, i'm always either in the basement where i wouldn't notice it, or completely asleep. which kinda sucks, it would be cool to notice one. lol|`|AA10334348	There's an earthquake practically every day here. It's the sound of my mother's footsteps shaking the floor.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Stayed in California, specifically Van Nuys for a long time 11 years ago.    They had tremors and little quakes all the time. All I can say is when the birds and wildlife stop making noises is when you should start sweating.    For those who have never been in one: it sounds like bang, banG, baNG, bANG, BANG, BANG, then BANg, BAng, Bang, bang, pfttt, pftt, nothing.    And of course things like furniture and other things move about on their own.|`|AAaux2Ryaa	The last 2 earthquakes I noticed while I was at home presented themselves as the blinds moving for no apparent reason.|`|yixKb0ocaa	I hear rumbling under the floorboards and windows then BAM, I feel the quake|`|D1tPCO0uaa	I usually look around if I hear rumbling or I feel shaking or rolling.

If I think there's a freight train coming and there are no tracks around - that might be an earthquake.  Or, if is sounds like a bomb was dropped a few miles away, that might be an earthquake.  Or, if all the kitchen cabinet doors are rattling open and shut.....  You get the idea.|`|R2GAuADHaa	Hello,  I'm actually learning about earthquakes in school right now. I have been since monday. It's funny because i live in Southern California on the San Andreas Fault. (and im not lieing). There is no alarm that goes off. There is many shelters though.     When i was like 3 in 1994, there was an earthquake that hit Ventura county (where i live) very badly. I remember our pool after the shaking was done, the waves in the pool where moving back and forth still. We lost about a foot and a half DEEP of water. Which is a lot. Southern California, as like many other places do many drills to practice when the big one is coming. And when it does, hopefully we are all ready.  If you have any questions about them, ask me.. i learning them now.. they are interesting.|`|TBsVYf8Daa	yes, when i'm sittin at my desk and my co-worker beside me shake his legs, i would go asking, "is there an earthquake?"|`|AA11084543	yeah, before when we had a bad earthquake stuff started shking and we got really quiet  my mom goes, "are we having an earthquake?"  then everything starts shaking and we got under the table and yeah  it was kinda scary though  a plate fell off the counter

In many states this means someone can sleep with you without risking a statutory rape charge. Althought the "age of consent" varies from state to state. 18 is just the safe bet, no one has a higher age of consent.    It's also legal for you to do a bunch of other things at 18. Like vote, smoke, etc.|`|AA12095466	they can legally have sex  and smoke  and u can finally make your own decisions, yur parents arent the boss of you anymore|`|4GdrJCvaaa	What?! legal to have sex? there's kids having sex everywhere at any age like its going out of style. It means your legally any adult. Say you get in trouble with the law if your 18 your tried as an adult not a juvenile. You can move out of your parents house. Buy a lottery ticket. you have the say over your life now. In other words "you're legal"|`|tR36oILvaa	legal to do stuff|`|umEgRb7Vaa	It means people 18 and older can now have sex with you legally.|`|WNVP6Uy6aa	its because when you turn 18, your legally an adult now..  anything "bad" you do now will permanently stay on your permanent record.|`|eYe3xRWVaa	its so stupid when people say that, because really the legal age to have sex is 16. 18 you can just vote and drink and what not|`|6004c09a1497ae22f6d3fe8cff3c4060aa	From what I understand it usually means you are of legal age to have sex with another, but of course it would depend on the state/county/country etc where you reside.  I guess it would also mean that you now have the right to vote also, or drink alcohol in some states.  I would take great thought, and encourage you to research any of the above mentioned, before participating in any of them, ESPECIALLY voting. hah hah.  take care ok.|`|AA10844626	You can have sex, in some places you can drive, in some places you can drink, you can go to the real jail, you can get arrested, you get freedom!|`|f42d397760b7105b553fe711e7bb2cf7aa	They can legally have sex.    edit: to dbaker, all those kids having sex are doing it illegally.

capqMpiCaa	yeah, it's fun:) they deserve it for being so attention starved anyway    and I bet most of the people on here that are calling you mean, are the ones that ask those kind of questions lmao|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	No. I'm no heartless Jerk!|`|skIPrlaVaa	nope i say u have low self-esteem|`|k1FenuRLaa	im sure that attitude will get u far in life|`|EzrdyxAiaa	no i try to give an honest answer!!!|`|en628a4haa	No, I don't.

If I think they are ugly, I don't lie to make them feel better. Sounds mean. But they asked. Not everyone in the world is going to think that they are beautiful. Doesn't mean that they are ugly, just in my opinion they might be.|`|c0p2BYwnaa	Yes, i used to. I never even bothered to click the links. But lately, i admit..i've softened up. I don't tell them they're ugly. I ask them what do they think about themselves. Beauty is nothing if you lack self-confidence. I am not brutal like you though.|`|ftixHrOnaa	No. They are probably dying for attention, but that's just mean. And I honestly think that if people have to say how wrong it is to ask those questions or calling them attention whores they should just keep it to themselves...

Don't ask stupid questions and you won't get stupid answers.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	I am tired of seeing people take their own picture - how stupid|`|E0PQQaNjaa	I always think they are vain and insecure.

I hear ya dude!|`|avpv7u8saa	no i'm honest|`|2JlCb7Avaa	i think you should stop saying stuff like that. people will get offended. its only ok to say stuff like that to someone who is really good friends with you- cause then they know ur joking|`|6Mlh2zAaaa	Nah,  im not a very mean person|`|GZRTLEuiaa	wow ur mean|`|kNTP6HWbaa	well with a name like "im sofa king..." i'd say your pretty immature, i tell it like it is, if they are truly ugly i come right out and say it, if they are actually pretty then i tell them they are pretty, if they are fine as hell then i pretty much tell them they are fine as hell|`|sJ7GzZLbaa	I think people ask that because they need some self esteem. It usually comes from people that do not think they are that great looking, probably because they may not have a lot of friends, no boyfriend or girlfriend, stuff like that and they want to know why. In reality they are usually not ugly... Ugly people that know they are ugly dont post pictures of themselves places asking if they are ugly.. know what I mean?|`|DrEgX4QNaa	Uhh     1) No Not Funny  2)Sometimes The People That Ask Aren't Snooty B*tches  3)I don't think you'd appreicate a comment like that|`|iHlRHGHcaa	I don't say things like that, I say things to make them feel super self concious like:  -You need to wax your upper lip.  -You need to whiten your teeth.  -Pluck your bushy eyebrows   lol|`|lZU0XzfTaa	hahaha  yeah man  and some of the people that got mad at you for saying that were ugly or asked that question...hahaha|`|vjvx4k9Uaa	No I don't answer  people only say those things for attention  and you don't seem to be very mature because those are things kids say  and they're mean  learn something nice ok?  honesty hurts  do you wanna be told your face is as ugly as a butt?  I didn't think so|`|f3265e6e564af0f5d6c3c04f02637cfeaa	Ya most of the time its the trampy looking blonde bimbo sitting in the front of the room who just can't stop looking at herself in the mirror....hehe... if it was her I would just give her an evil glare and watch her reaction most of the time their voice will get louder and they begin to freak out. LoL (OMG I sound like an evil person) Im actually blonde with a brain    But if its someone who is genuinely your friend and feel bad you know a white lie is sometimes the greatest answer.|`|EICm5lkIaa	dude thats mean. some might want attention others oppinions. but, maybe they dnt know ur joking and their self esteem goes down. afte u make a rough joke like that make sure they know. ot dnt make a stupid joke like that in the first place. its not cool|`|QAQTYuIjaa	i just tell them what they wanna hear|`|FprpWAH1aa	pssh thats rude. but atleast you are telling the truth but you just ignore the ? and go to another subject. the reason they are probably asking that is because they 1. have low self esteem 2. have no confidence 3. need some reassurance 4. know they are and want to drown in compliments 5. seriously doubt themselves and have been told something along your words in the past and you just made them right about how they feel.    and no one is ugly everyone has their own special qualities if you cant understand that not saying you dont then you need to grow up kid   when people say look on inner beauty its not a joke.   one could fall in love with a ok looking person but get so much more in return|`|aZnAHgJSaa	Some might say it to be snide (or to create unnecessary conflict - as I often always do for humor)    Just be very careful as to who you might be saying it to. Some people are very sensitive and might take it the wrong way.    Generally speaking, though, every one of those lines is immature-sounding - and it actually makes it sound like YOU'RE the one looking for attention.     Best way to respond to a question such as "Am I pretty?" - not just an affirmative answer, such as "yes", or "of course" - but complement on something specific.     By using the word "pretty", I'm assuming this is referring to a girl. Complementing on her eyes is always a rock solid grin cracker. Something girls spend a lot of time on though, like getting dressed, or doing their hair or nails, also leaves room to complement. If she takes an hour to get ready every morning - don't you think that deserves some appreciating?    Even if her hair has been the same way for a long time - complement her on it.     I'll tell you - as a guy - I used to have long hair 3-4 years ago back in middle school - and it was a massive responsibility to keep it clean. Of course, I didn't keep it RIDICULOUSLY clean - but many girls do. So, going to that effort every day, on top of all the other attributes, all deserves recognition - NOT satirical, snappy responses.     Hope this helps :)|`|xfj1B7YSaa	yes lying is wrong..we all know that. but certain situations call for desperate measures. it is not nice to tell someone that they are right out ugly. wat if u urself ask ppl if u look pretty. how would you want them to respond? im not saying that ur ugly but the next time you call somebody that, ask yourself if you wanna be called the same thng. its not about whether or not you tell the truth. its about BEING SENSITIVE to others' feelings that really count. and btw, ur comments may be true but its just rude and that makes you a jerk. no offense. and wats ugly to you may not be ugly to other people. so thnk before you speak, be sensitive, and tell the truth without souding like a jerk. example, instead of saying "youre ugly" you could say "you look fine but if you use this (insert beauty product),  i thnk it would really accentuate your eyes (or w/e) more, dont you thnk?".|`|wGUAiGSQaa	thats mean!|`|NCWWRfUcaa	ha your funny...Not|`|6v4KYFGoaa	I kind of thinks that mean.  You should just say "Well what do you think of your self?"|`|v2pEgAOXaa	I'm sorry but people who usually ask if they are pretty sometimes have a low self-esteem so that's kind of rude. Sorry|`|LWanA5ueaa	hahaha. i do it a lot because im tired of the ones where they are like "OMG WHO IS PRETTIER, MY BFF OR ME? HERE ARE 30 OF OUR MYSPACE PHOTOS"...like honestly, are you that desperate?    But sometimes i actually tell people they are pretty, if they seem like  they need a confidence boost|`|C76A0McDaa	no, I give them all the assurance I can|`|7o3ArWnCaa	Yes I do say they are ugly when they ask am i pretty because i think when some one ask something like that it just means they want attention because your paying attention to someone else. also when someone ask something like that for attention i think they have a ugly personality so i will say they are ugly cuz i think they have a ugly personality.
8XT1Tvcvaa	Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2007, and it received unanimously positive reviews, but whether it is good is still up to the listener. I downloaded it and enjoyed it, but you definitely need to have eclectic musical tastes to enjoy it. It's pretty much a fusion of dance music, electronica, reggae, hip hop, and various cultural musics.    If that sounds close to what you listen to, then I'd highly recommend picking it up.    And Paper Planes is by far the most "normal" song on there. So I wouldn't judge the album by that sound.|`|m2vBJaHKaa	no lmao ;)|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	It depends if you like their music...|`|kBwo2Cjdaa	You'd have to have a taste for her album...Kala i'm assuming your talking about, but yea i liked that album very much, if your a person who only likes the usual mainstream catchy stuff like "Paper Planes" i suggest listening to "Come Around ft. Timbaland" which was included with that album and is also a great song, nice bass too, M.I.A. has syk beats but...its all up to your opinion, i would recommend listening,

WZ5KMm6Uaa	Because it is like the best movie and Robert Pattinson is soooooooooooooooo hot!!!! I |`|BtDGWKSNaa	because most people (girls) are struck with this immense feeling of love in which they so desperately long for, but know in the back of their minds they will never have.  watching this movie gives said girls a false sense of satisfaction.  its also very poorly directed with awful shots mostly consisting of close ups, which is good for the less educated who can't follow a plot line or watch a film that is even slightly of a higher knowledge level.  these same girls tend to also love movies like john tucker must die and mean girls.  both of which sucked.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	In some cases its because they loved the books and want to see them transformed on screen much the same way that Harry Potter fans look forward to the movies.    Another reason is that it is a type of movie that is perennially popular, good looking cast in a very traditional good girl meets bad boy and falls in love story.|`|oJnkeYPVaa	because its amazing!! the acting is great and i LOVE the whole series.|`|yDoaHhskaa	cuz its awsome|`|ABAcvFVbaa	thats so not true the only fat 13 year old girls like twilight me personally i am sixteen with a aboyfriend and i love the seried just because  it a nice love story and who wouldnt want to have a bloodsucker for a boyfriend .    well i love the books the movie it broke my heart it six suck so bad o well|`|0511f3bb4bdbc72585ff80047cbbc691aa	I think it's because it's kinda sexy and romantic..|`|2TNFQAQEaa	People are obsessed with Twilight because they have daddy issues and want to believe that there is some magical guy that will be their true love and all that garbage.    These are the wrist-cutters of society who read anime and dye their hair purple.  I guess its cool nowadays, I don't know?    Anyways, its comforting to see someone (especially a girl) who doesn't see what's so special about Twilight, when usually all you hear on these forums is how Twilight is the best book ever written.|`|KGDgIvZ2aa	The Twilight movie mainly became popular after the books and although it wasnt as good as the books it has actors that portray the characters pretty spot-on. Also, Edward is hot.

G8jYlPqSaa	Im not sure but it looks like:    Evanescence-Imaginary    OR "Paper Flowers" by Evanescence again.    Anyway, both have the same lyrics and "Field of paper flowers" are in the lyrics of the song..    LYRICS:    (Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, paper flowers) [X2]    I linger in the doorway  Of alarm clock screaming  Monsters calling my name  Let me stay  Where the wind will whisper to me  Where the raindrops, as theyre falling, tell a story    [Chorus:]  In my field of paper flowers  And candy clouds of lullaby (flowers)  I lie inside myself for hours  And watch my purple sky fly over me (flowers)    Dont say Im out of touch  With this rampant chaos - your reality  I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge  The nightmare I built my own world to escape    [Chorus]    Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming  Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights  Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming  The goddess of imaginary light    [Chorus]    (Paper flowers)      Hope this helped!

vja4ddNmaa	Take a look at how the media has blasted Jessica Simpson over weight gain. Yea I say basically you must fit the mold or no longer be stamped as a celebrity.|`|XscVe0AYaa	Usually, the less talented you truly are, the more you'll have to "conform" to Hollywood's image.  There is a big difference between a "star" and someone with real talent.  The two can overlap but there are often times when they do not.|`|TRDkQciAaa	Yes. what do you expect to be? you cant just join in and be whatever the hell you want in a movie. they are the one making the film so they tell you what to do. this is not a free for all industry where you can act foolish and making the film look dumb when they show it. And yes you have to act what ever they tell you to be. If you dont like it. then leave the set.|`|mH8UscHdaa	It's so true|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	its called acting, you "play" the person in the script, that is how you get paid, by being someone else, seriously|`|viHy8mGeaa	yknow, I don't star questions often, but I decided to star this one    I'm pretty sure if you sign a contract with someone, you basically have to, or they can take you to court    It's probably no different in the states - or any country for that matter|`|KJLFVjoraa	Yes|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	sounds about right yea.|`|eVfSpFPvaa	sometimes yea..sometimes not necessarily.|`|3ac5a59538557456fe456ad4f9f9d7aaaa	Yes. It's like selling your soul to the devil.|`|P5ZNPyW4aa	Depends.  There are different levels of the entertainment industry.  You've got you BIG superstars, which yes, do have to be what the industry tells them to be if they want to stay big, but then as you go down the line to the less and less well known, it's not as big an issue.    And the thing about acting like you like them - TRUE.  Think about it- a celebrity bashes another celebrity...hours later, everyone is talking about it and they keep getting questions and paparazzi are going crazy!    Not to mention, that celeb they just dissed might have connections with people that won't give offers to the one speaking negatively.    Crazy business.|`|ZJH2tun5aa	no of course not, the entertainment industry is full of genuine people who are who they really are. The women just never get lines or wrinkles or put on weight. They all realy believe the smooth answers they are given by their publicists in press conferences.|`|0Sl5kmToaa	thanks for 2 points|`|pc5uxwTBaa	Yea, if you want to make any money. I am highly against the whole idea. I make music myself, hip hop, rapmetal, and early 80s-style hardcore punk. I make what I like. I probably make $25 a week from it. I don't care. I make music because I have a love for making music. Even as an artist, I highly support illegal file sharing (though I haven't done it for years after it screwed up my computer bad) If there was no money involved, people would make the music they want. But there are millions involved, so people chase the money. A prime example is Kid Rock. He was an amazing rapper in the early 90s, but after realizing that there was money in country, he became a really crappy country artist and made millions. Unfortunatly, it prevents artists' fullest potential from ever surfacing on a piece of vinyl. I am highly agains this (hell, I got an album in production deticated to my hatred of the idea), and I wish it would stop. In the meantime, I make my own records as a one-man group, I suck bad at the guitar but I try, and I pull off my best. And to tell you the truth, it ain't too bad. The only reason I haven't released anything yet is because I am yet to get my drum machine (I do have a demo that I entirely recorded at a guitar store). I wish more people tried as hard as me. But to give you a simple answer, yes, it is only for the money.|`|e722d856c2697f0d4905ea7a16aa0c9baa	It is always different what the entertainment industry wants or needs. But onething for sure. READ THE CONTRACT!!!!!!! Sometimes they say that they will practicly own you for certen hours of the day. NEVER SIGN A CONTRACT THAT SAYS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|BsCbaBIVaa	There is quite a bit of evidence from biographies and autobiographies of various stars, directors , producers and other talents in the entertainment industry that there is a constant tug of war on the complete packaging and presentation of a product.  In this case it is the person.  Some people have been able to force the industry to accept that their unique personality is the product, and not to be repackaged.  However with so much money riding on the line... There always seems to be one or more handlers or representatives to mold you into a format that can be marketed,      This has been going on as far back when movies moved from Silents to Sound.  ( Circa 1927) .    Certain actors and directors have played their part in the system, but often they have been burned by being treated as mold-able play-do... Suddenly you are dropped because you no longer are the person that first attracted the public and the movie industry.     I think any actor or other talent will have to make a self assessment of where to draw the line on being molded. Make that agent work for you and protect you. That is part of the reason they are earning the big bucks from your gigs.    At some point everyone has to make the decision work... or self value. That may mean you turn down situations because you retain yourself in this world.  All a personal decision.

This anime made me cry and I'm a boy. Haha. The first season isn't really sad and it just kind of tells you about stuff going on, The second season, gets way more serious, although not entirely, I don't wanna spoil it for you but let's just say It might make you cry too. Good luck and I hope you will find to like Clannad. Oh by the way, it's not really fictional, focuses more on real life, but sometimes it doesn't in this "another world" scene. I honestly don't understand it, but it barely shows up.

5mlcMu0Kaa	The doctors are suppose to be ethical and put the health of a patient above. Yes, you are absolutely right.     What I would like to say to this doctor is,  "You are being asked by the media to be interviwed.  So please accept the interviews and show your face to the nation.  If the USA ends up providing any public assistance to this woman and the 14 children, then the taxpayers have a right to know why you chose to implant all those embryos. You also knew this mother was single."    "Doctor, would you want to be raised in a family situation like this-with no father present and not even knowing who your biological father is or what he looks like?"    That is some of the questions I would ask.|`|eUWxE9GTaa	he's in it for money?|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Where are you going on vacation...must be expensive.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I would kick the doc in the head.

45Db0MJGaa	This was known as the "Golden Age" of television and some of the shows that were big at the time were variety shows like Jack Benny's show and Milton Berle who was also know as Mr. Television.

2XRPFkizaa	Yeah... Ditch the anime shirts unless you wanna look like an otaku poseur... If you have fitted black tshirts? Something with a design that's not anime related would be better. Accessories go a long way too like belts, necklaces, bracelets etc etc    If you're planning on dressing vk, it's likely that people may mistake you for being scene or emo coz most people are ignorant.     If you've got shorter layers up top you could poof it up slightly maybe? My hair's a bit past my shoulders and what I normally do is backcomb some of the hair underneath my top layers to give it more volume.

If you have done that well idk how to look Visual Kei but you could go totally retro!     srry that this probably didn't help you but just go what you want to. >.
WQy4rliaaa	Hitting the high notes is not about making the biggest sound or pressuring your body and head as much that it hurts when your done. That's not a good sign - it seems your technique may be lacking - and thats the hard part to fix - but working on your problems early is definately what you need.    Singing in higher ranges that are outside of your comfort zone need to be supported by good breath support and release from your diaphram. Don't force notes at all - get on a piano and run your voice up and down scales for a good fair while before you start songs. This helps get the muscles ready for hard work in tough songs. You'll notice it should be more comfortable to sing once you've fully warmed up with scales and the help of a piano.    When singing in higher ranges, place the sound at the most forward part of your mouth - without shouting - and 'unlock' your jaw so that it feels nice, relaxed, and comfortable - just like having a good yawn.    Apart from that - it's all about time and practice, building up your ranging by working with a piano on vocal excerises and technique will help you acheive that. If your really serious about getting alot better see a voice coach - one on one lessons is really invaluable. But start with what I've mentioned.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Always sing from your stomach.  To get the high notes, do scales.  The piano will help.    I've taught myself also. Fool around with your voice abit. Voice lessons will help getting you started to sing and will help you sing from your stomach.    Pratice doing Lalala on the 8 octaves. It will help you alot.   Singing from your head voice will make you sound different than singing from your stomach. If you sing from your throat, you will damage your vocal chords. Your head might hurt because your pushing your voice to hard and your hurting your vocal cords by doing that. Sing from your natural tone. use your stomach. Your voice will sound better and you will have more power and strength    Use your lowest register, whatever is your natural tone and keep going up the scale. Each time this will help strengthen your voice. It may be hard at first but the more you practice, the more it will be easier for you to sing your high notes.    Breath in and out as many times as you want  Breathe in and hiss while letting the air out slowly and count up to 15 secs and higher numbers each time  Pick a vowel to sing. For example,sing the vowel A on your natural tone and then hold it. Then you get higher each time. The piano will help you if you have one.  Do some facial exercises  Do your Do Rae Me's and hold the last note as long as you can  ABC's. I have no idea how to explain it.I'll try. Sing the 3 octave to the 1 octave. So you will sing A in 3 octave and key change it to the 1 octave or your natural tone. Keep going on every letter in the alphabet.    If you can offord voice lessons, then I would suggest it. I'm doing it but I'm doing it because I want to make my natural voice more powerful and have more strength. So I can blow away people with my voice. I'm taking opera/rock voice lessons. I'm lucky I have  a natural voice. And by you teaching yourself like I did, you will impress your vocal teacher because not many people would be where we are at with our voice.  Good luck!
hJP9y6kjaa	1) Get a usb audio interface. Make sure you can get or have ASIO drivers for it.    2) use a multitracking program to record. The other answerer was all about Pro Tools... I dislike Pro Tools, and prefer to use a simpler, more configurable program called Reaper. Oh yeah, it's also free to use and very cheap to register. Doesn't have a ton of built in plugins, but you can always download those, and many many many of them are free or shareware.    3) buy some mic's. again, the other answerer had some great suggestions - you want at least one large diaphragm condenser mic. The cheaper ones (ie below around 400$ or so) are made in China and tend to be thinner sounding.... great for recording things like cymbals and other instruments with lots of high frequency information, but they do tend to lack lower end response, so not as good for kicks, bass, and sometimes the warmth of vocals and guitars.    To balance that out, I would also suggest getting a couple of Shure SM57's and 58's.... dynamic mics tend to have warmer response, and the 57 is great for electric guitars and other "mid"-y instruments, and the '58 is great for vocals and string instruments.    If you're recording drums, I would get a kick mic and two small diaphragm condensers... you'll know them when you see them, they look more like pencils or sharpies. Use those for your overhead drum mics, they're the best choice for capturing cymbal sizzle, which is the hardest thing to get right imho in a home recording situation.    4) ummm cables and a couple of really good headphones.    5) getting a PA for vocals isn't a bad idea, while you're at it. Don't need it for recording, but having a good PA can be used for monitoring, too.      My personal strategy is to only record one instrument at a time. I create a scratch track using midi instruments (ie VSTi's) for drums n bass, create a scratch guitar track myself, and get the vocalist to at least get a rough vocal take down. Then, one by one, each band member goes through and re-records their parts, once they've had a chance to practice the song enough. Usually drums first, then bass, guitars, and vocals last. The benefit of this is that playing to a recording is tough - you have to be a better musician to do it. It also gets everyone on the same page. It also means no mic bleed, and the best ability to get the best sound from each instrument.    There's a lot that goes into the mixing process too, but that's kind of a whole separate mess on its own... levels, panning, EQ, compression, etc etc.        Saul|`|KBBonf97aa	If you're thinking about recording CDs, probably the easiest way is to get an audio interface that runs Pro Tools.  Since I record one track at a time, I use a Digidesign M-Box Mini, which costs about $300 at Musician's Friend.  The cool thing about the M-boxes is that they come with the current version of Pro Tools for you to install on your home computer, so it's basically a completely portable recording studio.  M-Box also has recording packages with monitors and microphones and cables, but I'm assuming you already have some of those.    Microphones are the most important thing for home recording and you'll probably want at least one condenser mic with a large diaphragm.  Those are good for recording vocals, acoustic instruments and even drums.  The MXL 990 sells for about $60 and comes with a shockmount so you won't have noise from a squeaky mic stand.  Two of those would be ideal, since you can record drums with one placed a few feet in front of a bass drum and one poised over the kit.  I use those to mic my amps, rather than plugging directly into the M-Box, since I want to capture the character of my amps.  But if you want to record direct, you can always monkey with the amps in Pro Tools to make them sound the way you like.    A tube preamp is a great idea, since it enables you to add tube amp warmth to everything from vocals to guitars without the individual expense of amps for each application.  Presonus has a model called the TubePre that sells with a large diaphragm condenser mic for $130 at Musician's Friend.  If you just plug the mic into the TubePre and then run the line into the M-Box, you'll be amazed at how great everything sounds.  I never thought I'd use such a thing, but now that I've got one, I'd be lost without it.     If you need a guide for getting started with computer recording, Musician's Friend has that, too.  Here's a link:    www.musiciansfriend.com/computerstudio    I recommend ProTools because it's the industry standard, so you can take your recordings with you to any studio and add things or tweak them without compatibility issues.  The biggest drawback is it takes a little while to become acquainted with all the features.  I also recommend the book "ProTools for Dummies."  That has been a huge time saver for me.  Good luck with your band!|`|U5KuwJpKaa	I don't know how serious you guys are about your music career (whether you're just jamming or looking for something more professional) but I can answer your question. I'm going to assume you own a computer based on the fact that you are posting questions to yahoo answers, and all you'll need past that is USB microphone(s) and the program Mixcraft 4. What I do when I record is simply set up a rock band microphone near my amp, adjusting volumes to reduce static. Surprisingly enough, it actually picks up sound pretty well and makes for a pretty good recording. I don't know how well this would work with more than one or two musicians (especially with a drummer) but, for a very basic, functional recording studio you could get a couple rock band mics and that program probably for around 150$ in total. Hope this helps :)|`|EKTO5p4Yaa	Greetings,    I've recorded and produced more than 140 full length albums and, without question, metal is the hardest genre to record.  Things that you can get away with on a pop album or hip hop would never fly on a metal album.      Because things are moving so fast, everything needs to pop and have clarity or the entire mix turns to mud.  For example, a big fat distorted kick drum sounds great on hip hop but would ruin a metal recording.  Think of the kick on the latest Dimmu Borgir album, that guy plays at 100 miles an hour (saw him do it in concert too) and to capture that kick sound would more than eat up your budget 3 times over and that is just one part of a complex instrument.    If you were a jazz quartet or doing pop I would advise you to go forward but since you are a metal band you would 100% be wasting your money attempting to record yourself on the budget you've stated.  Regardless of what you do or how you do it, it will never sound like anything you would ever ever want anyone to listen to.    Trust me on this one.

1DT7OUuHaa	No, the regular episodes are NOT live.  You are right, there's way too much editing for them to be live.  Plus, they have a lot of extra stuff that would be impossilbe to do live like when the judges describe their favorite dance moves and they instantly appear on the screen before they even begin describing them!  However, the finale is DEFINITELY LIVE!!! I just love the show.  My favorite crew is "Strikers All Stars".  They are AWESOME!  Whose yours?  They are all great though.  It's just that that the "Strikers" are so in sync and plus, they look so good!  Here's more on the show:   http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/dance_crew/c...

The characters are young, sexy and likeable....for the most part  :)    Good tension built up throughout the season as well.  The TV series does not follow the books exactly (which I have also read, and do not recommend - they are simplistic and poorly written) so I would give them a pass.      I cannot compare this to Buffy or Angel as I have not watched a lot of the series but have friends that are fans of both that enjoyed True Blood as well.     Definitely worth seeing.

2lByIoqGaa	I would say "It's like sound, but for your eyes. You know how there are many different tones, volumes, and variations of sounds? Well, color is the same, but you see the variation. There are different colors, just like different sounds, and then those colors have different hues, which would be different tones, and then they have different brightness levels, that would be the volume." It's hard to describe, but if you compare it to something they are familiar with, they'll get the gist of it. :)      you can't really describe the feeling you get when you see the color, because different people feel different things about the same things.... because they have had different life experiences.|`|GvLFP2b6aa	Black is the color they see 24/7.|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	reds hot|`|8nMYS2e2aa	it depends on if they went blind later on in life. then they would know what colors are like. if they were born blind or something i would describe them with other ways of feeling. idk how to say it. like when your mad or hot i would say thats what red is like. i would describe light blue like calmness or the breeze or something. i would associate it with feelings. i guess :)|`|04e0fa96acbc320b91b66dffc1fa2f97aa	There is no treatment for color deficiency. but certain type of tinted filters and contact  lenses may help to distinguish between colors.      to describe colors  is i think tough if i say grass is green he will tke green as he perceives grass.|`|KY2NaVtraa	it depends. If they were not born with the blindness, then it wouldn't be as hard. If they were born with blindness, and always have been blind, I think i would probably use like feelings to describe color to them, as i have always associated color with emotions and textures, even though i can see.     Red would be heat, burning, angry, and soft like silk. The sound of red is the heart beat in someones chest.   Orange is like how a fruit feels (an orange), rough and smooth, kind of soft, its the color of a kiss. It can be intense, soft, or comforting.   Yellow is a flower, soft and caring. It's smooth and delicate. It's the color of a smile.  Green is rough and loud, like traffic on the street or the rough texture of tree bark. It tastes sour like a lemon or lime.  Blue can feel like a soft cotton or a feather, or the wetness of tears on someones cheeks, the color of someones touch. The sound of birds chirping and children giggling. Blue is a soap bubble popping on your face.  Indigo is the color and sound of a summer night. It's loud silence. Its the color of a tight hug by someone bigger than you are.  Violet/Purple is smooth and scaly like a snake. It's cold and long and smells like grape soda. The taste is tingly like carbonated water, but with no distinct flavor. No matter how long you hold purple it will always be cold.

7ZfGqo3qaa	"Signs" was the beginning of the end.    An alien race that advanced - they could successfully navigate the interplanetary trip and remain undetected, and of all the planets they choose as their destination, this one?  One where 70% of the surface is deadly to them?  Let alone the fact that the atmosphere frequently dumps the stuff as part of normal weather?  And knowing this, they chose to come here anyway and run around naked?    The wooden door was bad enough but I'll let it go- it's just alien to them.  However, their technology has advanced to the point of space travel, and they never in their history discovered a use for protective clothing of any sort? Come on!!      Didn't occur to them to pack it when traveling to ANOTHER PLANET?!?!    Swing away!!! At the director's head....|`|BxrXZWn6aa	The real question is why do people LIKE him? Most people seem to think he's great. Most of his movies suck though. I never understood why people act like the Sixth Sense is such a classic...it was horrible!    I liked Ubreakable but the rest of his movies sucked! Especially the Village..    Oh...and person above me...he didn't do the Others...|`|8CankAcbaa	People think that his last 5 movies have tried to be too hard to be suspense thrillers and that'ss why his movie ratings since unbreakable have gone so far down.  sings- 6.9/10  the village- 6.6/10  lady in the water- 5.9/10  the happening- 5.3/10  these imdb ratings show that he is going down hill since unbreakable.|`|zUT4ZeM6aa	First of all (for C-Man) he didn't make "The Others". Second, on my opinion, he is original, with big fantasy and he knows how to present something (the story). He is very specific, strange author so you can like him or not but you can not say for him that he is a bad director. Any way, I like him.|`|HVQFVtelaa	Either they don't like Indians (I think he's Indian), they don't consider anything outside the Disney channel to be worthy of Oscar nomination, have no taste in movies, have no vision for good direction, have an I.Q. that rivals a peanut, never actually watched any of his stuff, or all of the above. Your call.    Me, I think there's too few rising stars in a disappointing industry to overlook this one.         Magyver|`|AeJrpZGqaa	First of all, originality doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. Neither does the fact that it was highest grossing for one weekend.     Shyamalan's just a different type of director. Haven't seen all of his movies.    Signs: Not bad  The Village: Many problems with the plot in this one.  Lady in the Water: I really don't understand why he saw the need to put in a guy who works out only one half of his body.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	I don't think people hate him, but he's not very good.    *** Correction***    He made 2 good movies - The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  But I rate him overall by looking at his entire body of work.    I thought he made The Others, thanks for pointing out that he didn't.  So his hit-to-miss ratio is even worse than I thought.    *****    Signs was bad, and his films after that sucked... HORRIBLY!    I agree that he's got big ideas, but his later works don't effectively communicate them to an audience.   He gets so caught up in his underlying message that he blows the basics.  Being a good director involves not screwing up little things, and not having ridiculous plot holes so large that the whole movie is trashed.    Box-office receipts do NOT the measure the quality of a film, just it's commerical success.  The Happening is a classic case-in-point.  Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace made tons of money, but was awful, especially compared to the original trilogy.  Men in Black 2 was terrible. Plenty of crappy horror movies and lousy comedies with a big star have made money.|`|2TNFQAQEaa	I don't see what's so wrong with M. Night either.    The Sixth Sense is a horror classic in my book.  Unbreakable was pretty entertaining.  Signs was very scary to me and sad at the same time.  The Village was also pretty creepy to me.  Lady in the Water was OK, but its not as bad as everyone says.  The Happening is actually good, despite the reviews.    I think people hate the guy because he's successful.  Although, I'm not so sure about Avatar.  Its based off a TV show from NICK...that's sad.|`|C4miEeuYaa	Actually-I love his work! I love movies that have a good twist at the end of them..My favorite by him so far is probably The Village..Followed by 6th Sense, Then Signs..Haven't seen Lady in the Water-but would like to. I liked The Happening-but I didn't like the way it ended..Altogether though, I love his work and I can't wait for more of it! :)

If you have to have dialog, do the movie where the person dreams he has shown up for class late and he only has minutes to finish a test he has not studied for yet. The person wakes up in relief think wow it was only a dream. Then he is handed an emopty test book.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	A "descent" film?  Just film yourself going down some stairs.  A "decent" film?  You should have been working on a script months ago.    Just film yourself walking down the street in whatever city you're in  Perhaps have someone with you to hold the camera and get shots of you if you want.  Or, perhaps you could shoot some people getting goofy on snowboards, skateboards, mountain bikes, whatever people play with wherever you are.  Here's another idea.  Write a speech about something, and film yourself giving the speech.|`|q2gNXyUYaa	I made a video for my senior project and I got an A.

Inside or outside. Even cut some scenes out. The story is not exciting, but it gives you an idea of the different camera shots you could use.     Here is the story     ESTBL SHOT  Several students enter the school from outside.  ESTBL SHOT The students enter the school lobby and sit in the chairs.  (2) 2-SHOTS  Students talking.  CLOSE-UP   Someone looking up hearing the bell to go to class.  LONG SHOT  Students get up and go to class.  ESTBL SHOT Students enter the classroom.  LONG SHOT  Several students sit at tables and get out school work.  OVS   Teacher (a team member) talking with students.  ECU   Student listening to teacher.  GROUP SHOT (side view) Students begin to write on papers.  ECU   The clock.  LONG SHOT  Students get up and leave the classroom.  POV   Students walking down hallway speaking with each other.

Y1aAGPURaa	This is a cute one that you both will enjoy:    A baby turtle was standing at the bottom of a large tree and with a deep sigh, started to climb. About an hour later, he reached a very high branch and walked along to the end. He turned and spread all four flippers and launched himself off the branch. On landing at the bottom in a pile of soft, dead leaves, he shook himself off, walked back to the bottom of the tree and with a sigh started to climb.    About an hour later, he again reached the very high branch, walked along, turned, spread his flippers and flung himself off the branch. Again, he landed on the bottom, shook himself off, went to the bottom of the tree, sighed and started climbing.     Watching these proceedings from the end of the branch were two little birds. Mummy bird turned to Daddy bird and said, "Don't you think it's time we told him he was adopted?"|`|bJ61uKFEaa	Why do women have boobs... so you got something to look at while your talking to them!!..    oh wait you want to impress her..|`|Y7wn5ZBwaa	what is "uoy evol i" backwards?|`|AA11763346	Anything appropriate to the situation.

You can try "Baby Boomers" If you like a classic try "Imitation of Life".|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	My Brilliant Career (1979)~It's exactly what you're looking for!  IMDb synopsis:  The heroine, Sybylla (Judi Davis), a headstrong girl growing up in early 20th century Australia, has the opportunity of marriage to a wealthy young man, Harry (Sam Neill), whom she loves. But, she rejects him in order to maintain her independence, preferring to take a job as governess/housekeeper to the family of an illiterate neighbor to whom her father owes money.    The Adventures of Nellie Bly (1981)  IMDb review:   Linda Purl channels Nelly Bly, a true-to-life early women's libber who proves that the fair sex can become a police beat reporter. Eschewing assignments in the leisure and fashion sections of her newspaper, she ventures into investigative reporting, a journalism category in which she pioneered. She volunteers to go undercover to investigate and consequently expose the abuses going on in a women's asylum.     Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger (1980)  Summary:   Bonnie Franklin stars as pioneering birth-control advocate Margaret Sanger, who in the early part of the 20th century conducted a 25-year battle to have her views legitimized by the puritanical, male-dominated medical establishment. The film covers the years 1912 through 1917, starting with Sanger's work as a New York City public health nurse. Appalled by the deaths brought about by self-induced abortions, Sanger campaigns to enlighten uneducated "lower-class" women in the proper methods of birth control, eventually opening her own clinic. Her efforts are rewarded with public scorn, attacks from various censorship advocates and frequent jail terms. In order to spice up an already fascinating story, the film places undue emphasis on the brief romance between Ms. Sanger and British sexual-liberation guru Havelock Ellis (Richard Johnson).     You also might try these:  Margaret Bourke-White (1989)~famed photojournalist  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097834/    I Dreamed of Africa (2000)   *SPOILER* She becomes a widow.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167203/    It's been awhile since I've seen some of these, but I recall that they are inidependent women. I don't recall about romantic involvement.

Sophmore year we were in geometry & we were just talking in the corner of the class. Then theres mister thomas, who we both hate. Mr. Thomas is old man with a boring & droned out voice and nose airs that seems like an afro in his nostrils. it's really gross to talk to him face to face.     Mr. Thomas is always in my buddies face. i mean always like " Nick, Do your homework!!!!!" and " Nick, pay attention during class!!!!"    He does the same to me, but when he says it, he simply talks. With Nick he screams at the top of his lungs! idk why!    So one day, Mr. Thomas comes up to us and goes" RED, NICK, PAY ATTENTION TO THE LESSON!!!!!!!!!" i didn't really get to me, but i could tell Nick was pissed off.     He starts turning red and PUNCHES the hell out Mr. Thomas, and he drops like a ton of bricks!!!!

It's our thing!  3) Unfortunately, the majority of us drive cars made in foreign country's that don't work and unfortunately we can't get anywhere with the terrible cars being unable to drive through snow.  4) We don't actually get much in the way of snow, so we rarely bother to do anything about it. We just ignore it  and "shut down" until it goes away. Which over here is about two days later then we don't see it again for another 3 years! A few days "shut down" every few years is hardly a big deal, so I guess that's why, that and the other three reasons I gave.        EDIT (also known as "Jimmy Page complains time"):  1) Not that it matters but, it's 15-20 inches at the moment not 8 or 3 as people have said...well more guessed actually they claim they don't live here so I'm a little confused how they can know!  2) Don't insult us, that's not cool. Do you really want to be mean like that?!  3) Yeah it's gone now, but they say it'll be back Thursday! So it'll be back around 2015. Weather people, regardless of country-location and nationality, are brain-dead idiots!

0BC2WTyoaa	I live in Seattle and they (Jackie & Bender) interviewed his sister in law this morning on the radio and asked her that question and she hesitated and then agreed when they said that it was a boat house that they supplied for him because it would be bad to show people where he really lived.

HJYjlmasaa	Honestly I wasn't a big fan of Ringmasters but I thought they were okay tonight.

I think this show is kind of rigged anyway.|`|0OeqHKRXaa	Fly Khicks arent that great but then again they actually DANCE  theres only so much time where RingMasters wouldve left because most of their stuff is real slow and filled with amazing stunts, those stunts become old to people leaving them with no choice.   so both groups werent too great|`|HCaAUig4aa	IM MAD THAT THE BOX CUTTERZ WENT HOME BUT OTHER THAN THAT!!!!      but other than that i think that fly khicks should gone home cuz i dont like them|`|kEEAcxQpaa	Sorry, I disagree. Ringmasters were definitely good at doing what they did but they're the sorriest excuse for a dance crew I've seen so far.     I do respect them because they are a group of black males from the ghetto men trying to do something with their lives, instead of selling drugs or hurting/killing people they chose to DO something good with their lives. Being that I am a black male and I am from the ghetto too I give them all respect but as a dance crew they weren't very impressive but they weren't my least favorite. They should've went home.|`|BEfhBLb9aa	i dont think ringmasters are that good they just do tricks flykhicks actually dance so umm yea|`|rabjcdjHaa	I am a little disappointed that Ringmasters got eliminated! Ringmasters is a very entertaining crew and I really wanted them to stay in the competition longer! Too bad that didn't happen though! I really think Fly Khicks should have gone home!|`|8XS7xeiXaa	a dance crew is about choreography, & ringmasters didn't have hardly any at all.  if they wanna do tricks, they can keep their name & head to the circus.      fly khicks are amazing.
VLRkJOOuaa	To answer your first question, yes, that is all. Claymore only has 26 episodes because at the time of its airing, it didn't get very popular. They actually had to cut the series short.      To your other question, yes -- there is also a manga (which in my honest opinion, is a lot better than the anime).    The anime is based off of the manga series, but, unlike the anime series, the manga hasn't officially ended. There are still more chapters being posted (about monthly on OneManga).    The anime started creating its own "fillers" -- things apart from the original plot/ storyline -- at around the 20th episode.    If I were in your position, I would just start the manga from the first chapter -- though a lot of the things you will read won't be new news to you because the anime probably went over it. But even though the plot is half-spoiled for you, just start over; trust me, it won't be a waste.      Claymore happens to be my favorite (and in my opinion one of the best) series out there.|`|AA12072871	So far...26...no substantial rumours about another series...  Excellent anime.    Claymore is a dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Norihiro Yagi. The series initially premiered in the now defunct Monthly Shnen Jump in the May 2001 issue. When the magazine was canceled in June 2007, the series was temporarily moved to Weekly Shnen Jump. When Jump Square was introduced in November 2007, the series was moved to it and is still on-going. The individual chapters are published in tankbon volumes by Shueisha, with 15 volumes released as of December 2008.    Madhouse Studios adapted the first eleven volumes of the series into a twenty-six episode anime series. Directed by Hiroyuki Tanaka the series premiered in Japan on NTV on April 3, 2007 and ran until September 25, 2007.     The Claymore manga is licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media, which began serializing the title in its Shonen Jump manga anthology in the April 11, 2006 issue. It released the first volume of the series on April 4, 2006 and has released 13 volumes as of October 2008. The anime adaptation is licensed for release in North America by Funimation Entertainment, which has released the first DVD for the series in fall 2008[1]. Madman Entertainment has licensed the anime for release in Australia and New Zealand.

Ofter David can spend the half hour working up to the punchline of one joke. When it hits you will laugh your *** off. Much more rewarding than the combined titters and chuckles from the likes of Friends.    Check out the Ricky Gervais / Larry David interview to see how he thinks of comedy, and the audience which they are both trying to appeal to.|`|iHqp2ZObaa	One of the best shows right now.|`|ZXXsDN53aa	Yeah.

bribxhsdaa	Most sucessful - Common and Primo - Remember "The Sixth Sense"? - That would be eaten up.    Sound the best - Pete Rock & Black Thought - Black Thought can flow on that kinda sound for fun..just like on "Organix" and "Do You Want More?!" Plus i think Pete is sitting on a lot more sweet samples than NY's finest suggested.    Most like to hear - Muggs and Deck...Deck is beyond underrated. and so is Muggs...I think you've already read my opinion on Muggs. Deck is Wu and most of the Wu members thrive on bass which is more or less Muggs's M.O. as a producer.    I don't think Mos Def would work with Hi-Tek..    I think Ghostface and Hi-Tek should make an album - Josephine = Fire.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Dj Premo and Common would make most successful simply for being most well known.  I would love to hear a Pete Rock/Black Thought collaboration and it would no doubt sound the best.  RZA/KGR?  IDK about that.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	The answer to all 3 would be Premo and Common. They already have a track record together - the 6th Sense.    I'd also be interested to hear a RZA/Kool G Rap combo. Dark eerie beats with a mafioso emcee sounds like it would gel nicely.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	DJ & Common would be for sure, the most successful duo...I don't think Muggs & Inspectah Deck would have any success at all xD seems like an odd combo to me...Pete Rock and Black Thought would sound best in my opinion, seems like a dope duo.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	Which would be the most successful? DJ Premier & Common (just because it's the most successful producer on your list combined with the most successful rapper on your list)  Which would sound the best? RZA & Kool G Rap (based on the tracks they've already done together, they have great chemistry)  Which would you like to hear? Pete Rock & Black Thought|`|DDmFQU7raa	Which would be the most successful?  DJ Premier & Common. Of all the rappers, Common has most name recognition.    Which would sound the best?  Tie between Pete Rock & Black Thought and DJ Muggs & Inspectah Deck.    Which would you like to hear?  Pete Rock & Black Thought. I've always thought rappers can easily blend with Pete Rock's soulful beats, and Black Thought would be a great combo.|`|aJfBtT9iaa	successful- premier and common  sound- Hi Tek and Mos Def  hear- premier and common|`|rMB71kZ8aa	blah|`|bLr5Wbmraa	Which would be the most successful?DJ Premier & Common  Which would sound the best?Pete Rock & Black Thought  Which would you like to hear?Pete Rock & Black Thought|`|NctYwdvhaa	1. Hi-Tek & Mos Def  2. Pete Rock & Black Thought  3. DJ Premier & Common|`|4SO4AeeUaa	Which would be the most successful?? I would have to go with the DJ Premier and Common one because the others wouldn't sell for ish. That's just the way the market is.     Which would sound the best?? Hi Tek and Mos Def because they have worked together (and have been successful) previously, so the chemistry would be there. I always thought that Hi Tek did all Mos Def beats.    Which would you like to hear?? Pete rock and Black Thought. Pete Rock is an amazing producer that is massively underrated, same with Black Thought as an emcee. Potential classic.|`|okECVBkzaa	Most successful - DJ Premier & Common. Common is more recognized than the rest.    Sound the best - Pete Rock and Black Thought. Great combo.    Like to hear - Rza and G Rap.|`|Y3amnioWaa	most successful-dj premier & common  sounds best-pete rock & black thought  like to hear- all of em

I feel like Oingo Boingo has to be in there somewhere though. Hard to narrow down the track too.    ***************  Hi Mach Pen. Long time no see. Hows it goin?    ****************  Yeah, kind of, sort of. Basically the band sort of fell apart half way through the record, but the singer and I are working with our friend who is producing it (and now picking up some of the drum and bass playing) to at least get it done after letting it sit for about a year or so. It's been good getting back to it.  All in all, I'm doing really well. My wife and I just bought a house which has been pretty exciting and just sort of been bumming around. Actually in the middle of a pretty nice patch of life.  How have things been going with you?    ***************  He Mr. Bernstein. You know it, I was actually just reaching for the mousse so I could get a good Flock of Seagulls do going.    ****************  Congrats on the assignments. Anything particularly awesome coming up?   Thanks too. We're really excited. It's really fun to have the whole feeling of ownership, and with the album I'm really happy. It just felt like I liked it too much to let it die like that. Lots of good stuff.    Hey Mr. Bernstein.  I think they do. If memory serves me correctly I just saw some in a store somewhat recently.    *************  Congrats! That's totally awesome.

JRFXt6O5aa	Heaven and Hell is Sabbath with Dio. Check out the older Sabbath with Ozzy. Dio solo is also great(especially Holy Diver and The Last in Line). Dio sang for Rainbow for short period of time.Some really good songs. Heaven and Hell is also the name of the Sabbath reunion with Dio and Appice.Check out the Dio/Sabbath albums Heaven and Hell,The Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer. Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Queensryche, Dream Theater are also Great R&R Bands that you can understand.|`|X3Q5VEDjaa	Edgar Winter 's CD "They only come out at night" it has Frankenstein, and Free ride. oldie but goodie.|`|Uo0T0f24aa	Try AC/DC       or    Gunz N Roses (i dont like them very much)|`|rfyRkyBwaa	Ozzy Osbourne is cool.So is Boston and Aerosmith.There is also some soft Metallica music out there....One, fade to black , nothing else matters, sad but true etc.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Check out Iron Maiden .They are still making great Cd's and have intelligent lyrics.

Great lyrics, great voices and great guitars.|`|tyCnjhXCaa	zeppelin:    when the levee breaks, d'yer mak'er, babe i'm gonna leave you, since i've been loving you, heartbreaker, over the hills and far away, stairway to heaven, nobody's fault but mine, in the evening, fool in the rain.. that should get you started with them.    sabbath:    sweet leaf, iron man, paranoid, black sabbath, symptom of the universe, war pigs, n.i.b., warning, sabbra cadabra, sabbath bloody sabbath..     hope this helped!
6lOpDK6Vaa	The answer to this question is really going to depend on you. You really need to ask yourself if you want to learn how to play piano or if you want to know how to play piano.     If you want to learn how to read music effectively, and be able to graduate to a true piano, then I would suggest the full size non-lighted keyboard, as the lights will simply be an excuse not to read the notes!    If you want to simply have fun and enjoy the music quickly, then you will probably want to lean towards the lighted keys.    Don't underestimate music reading! There's a very big difference between understanding how to read music, and reading music at a steady tempo whilst playing all those notes at the same time!    Also keep in mind that neither of the keyboards you linked to are 88-key. If you do feel like going that extra step and purchasing an 88-key, then I would suggest looking into purchasing a 'weighted key' keyboard. This will greatly improve your sound in the long run, not to mention improve finger strength!    Best of luck!
HjiqMDI6aa	Baby's Day Out was my favourite childhood film. I'd watch it any time of the day, any day of the week!|`|tLI94qWNaa	The goonies has to be one of my favorites  "Baby...baby..ruth..baby!"  :D lol  Love sloth.     My all time favorite childhood movie would have to have been between these movies:    The dark crystal   The labyrinth  James and the giant peach  Willow   Return to oz   The goonies of course   Muppet treasure island  The princess bride    I just cant pick one, sorry lol :D|`|PyB4MjwCaa	Lion King,     Circccllee of lifeeeeeee ?|`|gU4zcPAaaa	i just always loved the nightmare before christmas.  ahahhhahaha.    and my favourtie movie now is THE DARK KNIGHTTTTTTTTT|`|Pq6FbSuEaa	bloody hell there's so many i couldn't possibly pick one! ones that stand out are:    the bfg  willy wonka and the chocolate factory  matilda (so many rald dahl films!)  harriet the spy  return to oz  toy story  back to the future  bill and ted's excellent adventure  beauty and the beast  chitty chitty bang bang  mary poppins  bedknobs and broomsticks  escape to witch mountain :)  the watcher in the woods  the sandlot  honey i shrunk the kids :)|`|El7C2JsMaa	As soon as i saw this question i thought of the Goonies, i don't know anyone who doesn't love that film! I use Hey You Guys as my message tone on my phone, it always gets a laugh when it goes off!  Ha, yeah i used to fancy her as well!  The Truffle Shuffle  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=t5whaRkuip...  But this has to be my favourite scene from the entire movie, i just love it at the end when he says "no i'm too young, no i wanna play the violin!" brilliant!  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5UG7ISJfP...    I can't believe no-one has mentioned The Flight of the Navigator!  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fjv7k54YTa...  Absolutely love this film!    Also The Never Ending Story!    Basically 80's films rule!|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Bambi.|`|8yY7Aozoaa	drop dead fred loves it :)|`|btrMdy5Uaa	The Goonies was one of my faves too, but Wizard Of Oz takes the cake for me, lol|`|GLEGh4N0aa	Alice in wonderland :)|`|b7FbWNmlaa	Got to be Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, i love it , my little boy loves it now and knows all the songs!!  Truly scrumptious.|`|T891gsHraa	"the labyrinth "with david bowie and jennifer connelly but have so many more|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I can't pick just one. All of these came out before I was born, but they're really great anyway.    Willow (yes, he was the in the leprechaun movies, as well as harry potter, and the hitchhiker's guid to the galaxy and some other stuff I can't think of)  Labyrinth  The Dark Crystal  The Ewoks Movies  Star Wars  Robin Hood, the disney one, with the foxes.|`|m4PtEEDNaa	...that would be the enchanting 1966 part-live-action, part-animation fantasy/adventure film, called "The Daydreamer"; produced by Rankin/Bass (...the creative force behind all those classic animated puppet Christmas specials), and based upon the stories of children's fantasy author Hans Christian Anderson, I embraced this film at young age, and still embrace it quite fondly, even to this day.  The film inspired me to pursue, and continues to inspire me to pursue my own writing....|`|akcGfgdcaa	Got so many but I would say The Goonies, Back To The Future, Indiana Jones, and strangely enough TeenWolf as well. Oh and also Home Alone!|`|dPWMPaZgaa	I guess it was Tintin, on saturdays we hung out together, got the moviebox, a bag of lollies and watched Destination Moon, Tintin.|`|yg0ojTxZaa	A Goofy movie  Cinderella  Rugrats in Paris  Miss Congeniality

bribxhsdaa	Generally speaking Buy...    But there's a lot up with that.    Desirable to who/what though?    I know you said OF the machine. But you could be a servant of the machine who's desirable to Free Thinkers as ridicule fodder.    Plus, being a "free-thinker" as a concept is a paradox. (Shamless Plug) But read my blog entry on it (You'll see what i mean) -     http://capjacktruth.blogspot.com/2009/01...    No idea where you heard that..    It does however sound similar to a Tom Morello speech although what you're getting at is philosophical/political whilst this is pure politics:     "America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace.     Once you exercise this freedom youve lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesnt belong to you.     The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you dont care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve."|`|XDvOwLlNaa	Of course...that's what we go to school for. To be good enough serve somebody    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH8-p2XWr...|`|uePD9IAXaa	mos definitely noone likes a freethinker unless they are freely thinking about profits over costs.|`|IZtd0kBiaa	When hair metal dominated the charts in the late 80's early 90's, Nirvana  came with a completlety different sound in"Smells Like Teen Spirit" that has influenced music to this day.but thats very rare, so a big BUY!|`|SB5hdhM6aa	Buy|`|6fxr3VBGaa	F*ck what is desirable, I could care less.    That is probably why I'm so weird.    i do remember hearing it somewhere but i don't know where|`|3nRfePaaaa	yup.  but then again, free thinkers have given us some of the most innovative ideas and concepts that are essential to modern living/society.|`|bLr5Wbmraa	Thats common sense in my knowledge. Buy.    Nowadays a free thinker has a free mind but their feet are shackled and their bodies tortured.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	buy of course, a free thinker questions things and thats bad by a rulers standards|`|Evu9Eq06aa	Buy. They like to see us with a ball in our hands and some ice around our neck rather than book (And not one of those stupid urban books).
xmdh8iY3aa	Now this is real hard one for me (its a choice between 5 songs). But I'll go with     Where You At? ft. Papoose.

0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	I totally agree with your list but allow me to add   Sean Connery   Tom Hanks|`|AA12204338	Robert De Niro  Johnny Depp  Al Pacino  Morgan Freeman  Edward Norton|`|NR4hbYPiaa	Why can't I choose Ralph Macchio?  Have you SEEN the Karate Kid movies?  He was %&  & AWESOME!  He would kick Johnny Depp's a*s!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	mmmmm johnny depp.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Johnny Depp is my favorite on this list. The others are great too!|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I agree, but I would add to my list Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington|`|hXQjnPuGaa	From yours I would pick Robert De Niro or Jack Nicholson, although the others are all great too.      If I could pick my own it would be Micheal Sheen, or Viggo Mortensen.|`|c31b46d7046d9eab094655368fe0e190aa	1.- Jack Nicholson  2.- Robert De Niro  3.- Al Pacino  4.- Johnny Depp  5.- Daniel Day Lewis.    No need to say that there are four Oscar winners and one nominated.  Nevertheless, your list is a little short, because there is a new generation of very good actors, named in all the previous answers. I agree with all of them.  Great question!!!..:))) I love it.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Out of the list I would say Daniel Day Lewis is the best in the world right now, but I would follow him up with Sean Penn. DDL doesn't act in films as often as I would like him to, but he's the only actor who you can watch and completely immerse yourself into the belief that he IS the character that he plays.     De Niro and Pacino revolutionised the industry with their earlier work but their more recent things for the last 10-15years haven't been great, they just haven't demonstrated the hunger they had when they were younger.     Jack Nicholson's work is always good but he tends to just play himself more than anything.     Johnny Depp is versatile but that doesn't mean he's an amazing actor by any means.|`|6542d65c904582403b7e46c7c170a38eaa	Edward Norton  Giovanni Ribissi  Johnny Depp    well, I can only think of my top 3|`|tLI94qWNaa	1.Anthony Hopkins   2.Tim Roth  3.Russle Crowe  4.adrian brody  5.joaquin phoenix    I think that your list is perfect, but these are my top five.|`|KOsGtal8aa	i completely agree with ur list. although i would say edward norton would be 6th.

aXK9AMk0aa	he loves u but since u were just staring at him like that he might have thought that you dont love him back.  hes afraid of getting hurt|`|5Cre8ZnTaa	Dont read horoscopes and signs...they are not of God. Pray about it.|`|4KT1cXMBaa	He loves you, but he might be afraid of getting hurt.|`|1yTe0jfRaa	Many times they are afraid to say it in case they come off as being   'weird' or some crap like that.     This will sound weird but I tend not to say it to people I actually love, but people I don't actually care that much about I'll say it a lot. I rarely say it to people and actually mean it. Could be the same. He feels it, but doesn't feel the need to actually say it.    You try saying it and see how it goes..|`|cXRRP6ttaa	i think he may love u.. he said it more than once.  i'm not sure myself.. cancers seem to get moody and change suddenly. i don't know how to read them as well.|`|of3jiuDiaa	Yeah he loves you. I've been dating one for 7 months and that's how he started telling me.|`|FaLO77Mkaa	He loves you..
WgTKHqlnaa	I was glad they got rid of Stephanie. In some ways, she creeped me out. Overall though, I just don't think he likes her enough so it seems he made the right decision. I don't think Molly is cocky at all. I think she's really sweet. I like all of them left other than Naomi. I like Melissa and Molly because they're both cute and very sweet. I like Jillian because she's Canadian and so am I.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I was glad Stephanie got sent home because I didn't see a connection between them.  She was definitely interested but he seemed to only like her as a friend.  No offense to Stephanie but she seemed a lot older then 34, and she kind of looks like the Grinch to me.    My favorites are Molly and Melissa.  I will agree that Molly seems young, but Naomi seems about triple as young and I don't feel she is truly ready to be married or a mom.  Same goes for Jillian - there is an ounce of hesitation on her part and I don't think she is truly sincere.|`|AA12390047	I think Melissa or Jillian.  Naomi just seems to young and immature.  Jillian tells him how she truly feels.  I liked Stephanie too.  Maybe she'll be the next Bachlorette.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Mine was Stephanie too.  I thought she would have been perfect for him and made him very happy and she would have been faithful to him.  Oh well, he just wasn't attracted to her enough I guess.  She did look much older than him and I think he is really attracted to Molly and she might be the one for him.  We will see.|`|H7SQEM4Daa	I was upset too that Stephanie got cut. I really liked her. I'd like to see her come back next season as the Bachelorette.   Of the one's that are left,I like Melissa too. Jillian and Naomi just don't seem ready to be a mother. Not sure about Molly,she seems a little immature to me.  Just my two cents.|`|AzIBXcqxaa	My favorite is Melissa. She just seems like a "roll with the flow" kind of girl and that's what she will need to be to become a stepmom. She's very cute and has a really good personality.|`|dLq96ieYaa	I agree 100% on what you just said. I would not change one word.|`|OTj8vfQzaa	I was sad for Stephanie too, but I could tell he just wasn't feeling it for her. I really like Melissa. I have liked her from the start. I think Jillian or Naomi will go home next and Melissa and Molly will be the final two.   I hope he chooses Melissa and I hope whoever he chooses doesn't break his heart.|`|GLffLgFXaa	I was really upset when he cut Stephanie! I actually didn't think she would last the first show but I grew to like her. I think one of the reasons he cut her is because he didn't want two kids in the end.     I find it funny that the girls are acting like it's going to be one big happy family...whatever girl he chooses, him and his son, and they say they don't care that he's divorced. They're in for a huge surprise! I'm currently dating a man who's divorced and it's the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. They will never ever come first in his life, always second, and sometimes third if the ex-wife has a strong influence over him.    Also, if his ex doesn't like the girl he chooses (like in my case) she can make the girl's life miserable. I say good luck to whoever he chooses but she should go into it knowing what to expect.|`|AA11608168	AWW yes.  It was definitely heartbreaking last night when he let Steph go, but honestly if you watched you could tell that he and her didn't have the same connection that he had with Melissa.  Of course we all loved Steph, what is there NOT to like about her, she's sweet, genuine and very caring.  But Jason isn't romantically connected as with the other girls.  I agree about Molly, she's very immature and her personality isn't very real.  We'll see, but i'm putting my bets on Mel!!!|`|F93FZyo1aa	i liked Stephanie but she looked a little odd around the eyes. and you could tell he just wasnt that into her.    i like Melissa or Jillian...Molly maybe, but not Naomi at all.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Melissa is the right choice in my opinion. I just don't think Molly is that great and Naomi is too young. I like Jillian but her guard is up.    i just hope that ABC sees that  alot of us have already had a connection to Stephanie and if they gave Jason a single dad a second shot at love they will in turn give one Stephanie. It would be a win win situation for the network an the million of us Stephanie fans. She is a class act.|`|n8NzX47Iaa	Yes stephanie was the best, she was so mature and you know she would treat him right she a mother who knows how to care for a child. As for the other women, i think melissa is cute but she doesnt seem ready to be a mother, even though she was cool when jason cancelled you could tell she was upset, molley is a bit immature and full of herself, i really dont like noemi and jullian i dont think is serious, but tell me i could have sworn i seen a preview where diana comes back. and jason was on the balcony crying. i have watched all the shows did i miss it? i could have sworn there were more girls in the preview i mean its almost over/
4E07Ejkiaa	I flirt all the time. It is so fun!     Melons- your picture is smoking hot!|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Ehh no.    I'm to shy. I've been told I can't even tell when people are flirting with me.|`|RfPDOPEwaa	ive been told  i don't even notice when im doing it :|  which sucks because i flirt with a guy im not even attracted to without knowing it  and that gives them the wrong idea or make them jump to conclusions lol|`|y6406A92aa	Not really....|`|EblQojpEaa	Oh for sure, i love it.

Men that I don't know say hello to me a lot.  I have on a wedding ring so I always wonder about that one.  People tell me I am a flirt so I guess they see me better than I do.|`|vryw9udtaa	yeah, with guys i don't even like, and i have no idea why i do that! i don't want to give them the wrong message, but i just can't stop myself. i don't even know i'm doing it.|`|Dvawm8Ezaa	yes. it's a natural reaction i guess.|`|n1gwpYNoaa	yah, usually i don't even realize that i'm flirting.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Yes and my family realized i was doing it b4 i did lol but it's cool to flirt as long as it dont go far|`|plrR4pHiaa	Yes. I don't even notice until the guy hits on me that maybe it can be mistaking as flirting.
XstaAKLLaa	a one night stand is when one meets someone and they have sex straightaway without having any intentions of meeting up or having a relationship afterwards.     If BOTH partners are adults and willing to do it, then there's nothing wrong with it as long as they are mature enough to use protection and both have a stable life (such as a job)which enables them to handle the consequences (in case of an unwanted pregnancy).     In my opinion, I think that it's up to the two individuals concerned to decide what to do and it's not right for us to judge negatively people who have had one-night stands. Everyone has the right to do whatever s/he wants as long as both partners are on the same page (none of them want a relationship but both are looking just for a night of passion).|`|FDt7cC8haa	Isn't it what you get included when you purchase the mirror and dresser along with the bedroom set?|`|AdeD0xMuaa	1.  one night stand    Hooking up with someone for one night of sex with no strings attached and hoping to never see them again. It is important not to exchange any personal info with them so they can't track you down and stalk you later.   I had a one night stand with this guy I picked up at the club     2.  one night stand     When you bang a chick with the intentions of never seeing or talking to her ever again.     3.  One Night Stand     The dirtiest form of pointless sex.   A guy or a girl meets someone at some place (usually dance club)   and decides to have sex (only one time) with   that person without getting into a relationship.     The next day you leave without saying anything and   hoping that you didn't get any STDs...|`|659f1f810e91bd90e89b9598970c5d20aa	Just a bootie call...Never going back for seconds...Never going to call again...That simple|`|T3LYP0VDaa	the "Happy Hooker" only knits you a fig leaf|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HEY,,,DONT DIG THAT GRAVE,,,ITS A TRUE DEF,,,OF A ONE NIGHT STAND,,,,A GOOD ONE,,,LOL,,,,,WALK AWAY......PEACE

I rewound my tape of tonight's Bones, and replayed that ending, and even put the captioning on,,,,it is very beautiful...but the way they shrink the dang credits at the end, it is hard to even see, and my tape ended 2 seconds before the end of the credits anyway! THEN, I went to the foxsite for Bones, (some stations actually tell you their music,,but this one doesn't seem to)-- SO, I figure in a day or two, the "full episode" will be available on their site, and you will actually be able to read their credits.......    I tried typing a few of the lyrics into reg. search, but no hits,,,,,maybe some forum somewhere tells,,,,,,,,,now you have me curious, if I figure it out, I will come back and edit!

7w30Zn2raa	Technically you had the name first, so it is yours. I say keep playing regardless of this other band. If they get famous you can take legal action (if you can prove you had the name first...I'm pretty sure naming yourself via myspace counts as copyrighted) and either get some money out of them or force them to change the name. If you get famous then you have nothing to worry about, because they're just a bunch of ******* and you are now rock GODS! haha seriously though, I hate band name drama...so hard to be original these days...Good Luck!!|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Hmm. Maybe your name was too generic?    It doesn't matter unless they're in the same area as you... or unless either of you starts selling albums, ie signed with a label or something. The first one to do that would probably get the rights to the name.    Just because you thought of it first, and used it for a while, doesn't mean anything legally, unfortunately. You can't sue them to make them change it, since it sounds like you never set the legal precedent (ie made money doing it) first.      Saul|`|4vxJiXTYaa	Get famous before them :P|`|iHqp2ZObaa	Worry more about your music than your name.|`|3G69tug7aa	http://cinerel.org/

sj3HJ5jZaa	you're lying|`|dpSTgytfaa	your lying
vphjVZ2maa	Etta, Etta, Etta, what has time done to you. Some one sings a song that you made famous ( didn't write ), and your upset. Or are you upset that you weren't asked to sing it for the President and First Lady.  Its not your time any more to hold the spot lite. Its a new day, with new faces. That young lady did that song justice. You remind me of those that hated us back in the day, and would say almost anything to divide us. Shame on you for causing division were there was unity. I enjoyed you from the beginning, and support your work even now, but had no idea you were so shallow in heart.|`|NLM6eJZ4aa	Sorry if this sounds disrespectful ...but Etta James is really making a huge fool of herself and embarrassing alot of people..She should be elated that Beyonce did a rendition of her song...It brings her dusty butt into the spotlight again after all these years (dummy). She's being very foolish and looking like a mean old bitter washed out old lady. It's not like she's out there touring the world making millions of dollars each year...what is she thinking..Beyonce was doing HER a favor...I give her the props that she deserves from all of the accomplishments that she's achieved back in the day ..but this display is just plain idiotic!|`|AA10986891	Beyonce sucks and finally some one other than Aretha Franklin had the guts to call her out. Beyonce is sooooo overated and honestly I can not stand her.    What really pissed off Miss Etta james is that Beyonce never called her to get her blessing to sing her song.|`|AA10652430	Etta James got that HATERADE. She should be very flattered of Beyonce's portrayal. I think Beyonce did a fine job...|`|AA12363453	That old bag is one hot mess and she should not said that about the president....now she will be remember for this foolishness instead of "her" song...way to go ya old bag....|`|0JjTt1rQaa	i think Etta James needs to grow up and stop hatin on Beyonce. Beyonce did a wonderful job and Etta James is just a mean old hag lady. Technically it wasn't even Etta James' song so she needs to get over it and stop acting immature|`|ea89a02e27750668fed986721c820b6daa	Wouldn't it have been so classy to have Etta James sing her own song for the President?  The rift with Aretha was much the same.  Beyonce is talented but she is not a living legend.  She can't headline Aretha, or Etta, or even Mary J.  She got lucky with a couple of hits and managed to marry a rich black man, but lately I am getting sick of her to.  Her songs are simple and uncomplicated,  she has no vocal range, and she is boarder line for being over marketed.  She needs to chill and go have some J-Z babies.  One day she a diva, next day she is Ms. Independent and then she marries J-Z who favorite word is B. and H.  By the way J-Z ain't had a hit in a good minute.

TkQBalj9aa	I don't think she is pretty, nor do I think that she has any talent.  Hello? She is not a good singer! Her voice sounds so manly and nasty ughhh can't really explain it.     I am NOT jealous. Please, I would NEVER want to be her. Even though she is rich... lol     I have no idea why people say that others who don't like Miley/any other celebrity are jealous though.|`|uFBXM4rIaa	because for some reason, it just comes off that way.  yeah i think miley's pretty, but i don't attack people who  find her average looking or ugly. i think its pointless.|`|fwsZaIbraa	i think shes cute|`|EUh4t22zaa	to be honest i dont think she is a good singer  but she is pretty though|`|QeyFR2rqaa	This is only barely a question|`|XqkqCPYVaa	She isnt all that great of a singer and her teeth look like someone threw a bunch of tic tacs at her face and she caught them with her lips lol she is really irritating|`|PMK86fHoaa	she is not pretty.  she cannot sing.  she cannot act.  she is trash.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	ignore them people. i love her, but i understand others' opinions though.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	She isn't average she is HOT!|`|BrjyljGIaa	You don't see what's so special about her, but I bet you think that you're something special, huh?|`|vLD8L1P0aa	Shes not pretty  and she sucks at singing  shes only famous because her dad|`|p2TCIUfRaa	I agree with you. I dont know why people get all caught up in celebs business. But everyone is always self conscious about something, whether its their looks or something of the sort. Thats just the way life goes, but yes, I totally agree. And personally, I dont really care what happens to celebrities b/c its none of my business. People are just bored, so they find that picking on others is entertaining.|`|2af29aae9cc6a52e678fd65413877688aa	I personally think she looks like a beaver, and I'm so sick of all her little "fans" defending her on every website, it's pathetic.|`|9ni90gyVaa	shes just a girl.|`|TGjM9F9Waa	miley cyrus looks like a freakin gopher.

HELLL NO!!!!! she wouldn't be famous if it wern't for her father. she'd be a nobody.|`|L5IOvQZmaa	I agree with you for the most part. She doesn't have a good voice, regardless of what all the roaring tweens say.   In my opinion, she's very pretty, but just because you don't agree doesn't mean you're jealous of her.    Some people need to grow up.
JReroESmaa	I know! that's exactly what I think:)  (except I din't go to their concert for my kids :P )   I mean I know they are not the best band in the world but aren't that bad either ;D    and yes people they DO WRITE their own songs|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Did you just compare them to The Beatles?    Don't even.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	Man, they are talentless drones. They may play there own instruments but it isn't hard to play one chord over and over. It' not music, it's corporate crap.  Real music:  The Doors  The Beatles  Led Zeppelin  Pink Floyd  Jefferson Airplane  The Who  Jimmi Hendrix    There is a reason these bands have been around for 30 + years. They were innovative and brought something new to the table. The Jonas Brothers, same old sh*t, differnet band name.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	They write their own music?|`|MYsSyfQzaa	Yes, your right about the record deal thing, but do you know why they are on Hollywood Records? cause they got DROPPED by Sony/BMG for poor album sales!!!!!!!!!. Yes I actually listened to some of the JB Fangirls "facts"|`|6jNBKvQGaa	Dear god I hope you're joking.

They are the male version of birtney spears.|`|Oextrh4iaa	You are completely right. I believe that most people who do hate them are probably teens in the age groups or 16-20, who think that they are a disgrace to music. They are three talented young men.|`|J7oQV0zPaa	I respect your opinion but comparing Jonas Brothers to The Beatles could be asking for trouble here!|`|iHqp2ZObaa	They're not artists, they're a manufactured band who are just around to make money.|`|3G69tug7aa	http://cinerel.org/|`|UQLkPdGVaa	cos they suck assssssssssssssssssssssssss|`|gNwEO8ZFaa	i think they're a talented band but i think there getting overrated and people think that they're just there for the fame and glory since there just teenagers who attracts girls....    stereotyping......    this is what i think..|`|7LQKYwcHaa	lol teenage girls could probably care less about how they sang, they alll think theyre hott muffins.|`|ArwRJdOCaa	Because they suck the only reason anyone likes them is because teenage girls like seeing them jump around on stage! And they think they are cute. There just to teeny.|`|uftgjEqWaa	well... it's not that they didn't have a contract before disney it that they are disney's new hannah montana.  I somehow just have a problem with disney bands and that it's kinda juvenile.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	There's a lot of hate for them because most people here don't like the fans they're associated with, don't like their lyrics, and don't like their music so it ends up with us practically loathing them.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Don't even try to compare them to the Beatles.|`|O5xCjej1aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apwo12wHR...|`|3ctchU2faa	Comparing them to the Beatles is musical SACRILEGE!|`|gDxMoBl9aa	How much do You clank when You walk Kingler?|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Lol, uh, are you completely sure they write their own songs?

8yE2sYGeaa	I think it has to do with how it is presented|`|ZRqSpl1Aaa	Because the TV is the physical thing that you watch tv shows on. A movie is not the physical thing you watch movies on. You can be IN a TV show. Get it?|`|OQF1HlwRaa	because i'm a star. :]|`|DFHmieZtaa	Well with a movie you are IN it because it is just a one time thing (usually). You are ON tv because most shows can be viewed at least once a day or week and is available more readily. And people like to say "What's on TV".|`|Kr9CowEXaa	I seriously just had a conversation about this last night with my dad. No joke.    I think it's because a TV show is on air, but after a show stops making new episodes, or you stop appearing on it, you were in the show.|`|3G69tug7aa	http://cinerel.org/|`|4gqbzH4Waa	because it sounds better to say that someones starring IN a movie instead of ON a movie. and if someone was IN tv that would confuse people and ON sounds better anyway. so they are basically the same thing its just a matter of what sounds better but it is really kind of weird

5hHpvrPKaa	Hope that your not trying to kill yourself.  It would not be eating for a while because there are people that fast for forty days or more. Fasting is when you don't eat.  I would say that there are a few ways that are fast to dying.  One way could be a really bad car accident. Our bodies aren't made to take so much of a force at a time which could lead to death.  Another way is having a really bad allergic reaction to something.  Someone can have a Seizure and die depending on how bad the seizure was.  A heart attack can also be fast.  There could be other quick ways of dying but it doesn't deal with all of us.   Like the allergic reaction can go down here because not everyone is allergic to something.  Another could be for a person that doesn't know how to swim and they fall into a river or a lake or a pond.|`|4VFEkqJiaa	I would think that a bomb being dropped on your head would be a pretty quick way of snuffing it.|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	Not drinking water for days|`|1vGfcIf1aa	dont eat for a while.    i hope your not planning on doing this.|`|EsufC1qhaa	the answer is simple :    when u die, it is not necessarily killing yourself. so when you die of an illness or something, it is pure dying and not killing.     killing is totally a different matter. it is either a stabbing, knifing , etc (a murder) or even a suicide.    i hope u get the difference. and by the way, ur question does make sense.. duh|`|re06t6zvaa	splattering on the floor from free falling.|`|F4knwfVsaa	Tie a Cinderblock to your feet and jump in a lake, make sure you are tied to a loose branch over the lake so it will stun you on the way down but still let you sink to the bottom.

It all just looks so fake and they're so predictable these days.  I find most horror movies these days would be better suited for the comedy genre.

Nowadays people watch crap like SAW and Hostel and think that because there's blood, gore, darkness and sex appeal that means there's a good movie there which is pretty much bullshit.|`|s5cCsCbraa	I would have to suggest multiple ideas, I agree with you by the way.    1.  Hollywood just doesn't horror movies the resources it needs?    2.  Horror movies can be very abstract, meaning it takes a lot of talent to make a good horror movie.    Personally I think it's  1,  there are tons of good horror books.  The amount of good ideas RL Stine has come up with alone is really significant.  I would recommend books to someone who likes horror.|`|3G69tug7aa	http://cinerel.org/|`|UtwJVPn5aa	every director thinks they know how to make the perfect horror movie. i mean look at all the stupid new horrors and remakes: the unborn, one missed call, the grudge, texas chainsaw massacre, friday the thirteenth, halloween. all those movies purely sucked. all tried so hard to be good that they for got the real essence of a good scare|`|AM33tqYAaa	crappy directors, same plot, ex. crazy guy with knife goes on killing spree, thats original.  too many characters, etc.|`|zfN019uyaa	because everybody is so used to seeing all these "scary" movies. everyone knows whats coming and theyre expecting this to happen and when it does its not scary anymore.|`|by8Czojuaa	It could be because they're expensive.|`|DFHmieZtaa	Sadly there is no more originality. Most horror movies made today are based off of movies and books made years ago that just get rehashed into some thing new. Some times it works some times it doesn't. Now not all movies are like this but some times it feels like a lot of them are.

HSSuKNCUaa	I'm a Taurus, my man's Aries, we are frighteningly much alike sometimes. I think it also has to do that we're also both Sag rising, also both Aries Merury & Venus. We have some things in common that aren't always common.    - What's definitely not uncommon is that we're both very stubborn and passionate.  - We both believe that a fight every now and then is a good sign because it shows you care.  - We're both mad about travelling.  - We were both always loners.  - We were both late blossomers (he had his first girlfriend at 23, he's my first boyfriend at 21)  - We were both previously not very good at partnership until we found our match in each other.  - We're both practical.  - We're both quite physical.    Besides that, he is usually a bit more sensitive than I am.|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	I get along with my Aries friend we like to go out and get drunk and cause havoc.|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	Being opinionated and stubborn.

One minute he is hot and the next he's so cold.. I'm very independent he's not, I like to go, do and see, he could care less about that when we are together he makes me feel like no other man has made me feel safe, warm and secure but of course their is a flip side to this we butt heads so much because we both are headstrong people and very opinionated and I feel boxed in sometimes when I feel like he's trying to control me I don't like that. What I do know for sure is that he has more patience with me than I do with myself.. If that makes any sense... If you care about this person that's what an Aries is going to have is Patience it's not easy. When I have strong feelings for someone I give my all and I expect the same in return..  See I'm a woman who really beats to her own drum and I do like a challenge, and this is what have kept me here with him for so long I have told this man if you don't want me or need me tell me to leave he never has..So I have to learn to let things fall into place

DFHmieZtaa	It wasnt a gorilla it was big foot. The name of the Movie is Harry and the Hendersons. It has John Lithgow in it.    here is a link to the movie.    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093148/|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Harry and the Hendersons (1987)    John Lithgow.    Returning from a hunting trip in the forest, the Henderson family's car hits an animal in the road. At first they fear it was a man, but when they examine the "body" they find it's a "bigfoot". They think it's dead so they decide to take it home (there could be some money in this..). As you guessed, "it" isn't dead. Far from being the ferocious monster they fear "Harry" to be, he's a friendly giant. In their attempts to keep Harry a secret, the Henderson's have to hide him from the authorities and a man, who has made it his goal in life, to catch a "bigfoot".|`|AM33tqYAaa	harry and the hendersons|`|Qjuwmat0aa	harry and the hendersons.  great movie|`|31bk0N0Kaa	harry and the hendersons

It's a known fact that men are physically stronger and therefore generally better at sports. They can tackle better in football, jump higher in basketball, hit the ball harder in baseball, tackle and slap the puck better in hockey, tumble higher and faster in gymnastics etc etc. That said, as you mentioned, this is in general. I'm sure there are females who are better at sports than males, but if you are looking at pro level teams, men are generally better at it.

PILm2U4Taa	I prefer Batman as a character, and he DID defeat Supeerman in Frank Miller's Dark Knight  4, but realistically, Superman would be too fast. Batman's reflexes, while honed to the extreme, are still human...|`|wdxUb3moaa	Superman...fo...sho!    ~(^..^)|`|NwT0FTGiaa	there was a comic book issue were they fought. superman was infected with a space virus that makes him all crazy. batman is in metropolis when superman spots him. super man says, "it's time that i got rid of you wayne." then he says. "you know clark i never liked you at all." then he takes a kryptonight glove and starts beating the crap out of him.|`|qbbwm7E8aa	i like batman more!!!!!!!|`|pwMLaW2Baa	batman|`|K9X0q7Whaa	ah yes one of the ultimate questions that has teased mankind.  I would have to say batman.  Yes, its true superman is stronger and faster and he does have that damned spit curl, but what batman has is preparation.  You see he studies every encounter he goes into. Yes this would involve kryptonite.  True, lex luther, metallo, parasite, etc have all used the glowing green rock on the boy scout and he survived to see another day, but what where they failed is they beielved that they could just hold the rock close enough to the big guy and gloat until he was weak enough to be killed, eighter that or make some makshift weapon out of it and it break of shatter before it worked effectively.  Batman has spent years with Supes...he studied him to the point where he knows everything about him down to a moleculer level.  He is always about prepareing for the unthinkable, and believe me on the chance case that supes decided to switch sides and try to take over the world, which has happened without batman present in the storyline,  bats is prepared with an entire arsenal of kryptonian butt wooping technology.  He would be sure never to hesitate to take him out if he ever had the oppprtunity to stop him if ever posed a threat to mankind or innocents.|`|MhjZMgzTaa	I think batman would win.   I think superman would beat him to a pulp, and batman would just use the kryptonite at the last second.|`|DVqZ8oHjaa	In a straight brawl Superman would win every single time, HOWEVER in a fight of cunning and skill with gadgets and evil green rocks I believe Batman to win....Krytonite aside though and Superman would smash the bat.
diDFAFMwaa	Okay so basically, the cross over is still going on. This last episode was just the beginning of the cross over. So on Private Practice it just showed Addison point of view when she called Derek. So the cross over is still going on.

But i'm pretty sure it will next weeks!|`|UlSQWeTLaa	during Greys anatomy it was supposed to be like private practice was going on so at the end of the Greys anatomy episode Addison calls derrik and then n the end of the private practice episode it shows addison calling derrik.

That new doctor that's been clashing with Bailey? I don't know why they didn't hook her up with Meredith's friend, but I guess they figure the new doc is more of a match for Callie. I was so afraid they were going to drop the lesbian story line, but thank goodness they didn't! I don't blame that doc for hitting on Callie.. I'd do the same in a heartbeat if I didn't faint first! Callie/Sara is HOT!|`|1fjXNY7Waa	Oh, they are canceling the bad shows now.|`|2430e6b4cc0fa3948d82027429cd5ae6aa	Addison called Derek because she needs his help with her brother who is having seizures because of parasites in his brain.

7dGpL4mSaa	I know I'm am going to get many thumb downs, but I don't care. You're friend is right. I swear. You can get a virus and it'll stay in your body till you are pregnant for I think it was 6 months or something. Then your baby will die. I'm not kidding, really. Also, it can get you some virus that actually eats up your stomach. Some people I know actually know a girl that has been pregnant many times and all the babies died at about 6 months in her. My grandpa knows a girl that has a virus from a cat in her that kills her with pain every day.     If you really want to keep your cat, make sure you take her to the vet and make sure she has all her vaccinations and wash your hands before eating and don't get her too close to your face.      But that doesn't necessarily happen to everyone. It randomly happens. I know many women who had cats and now have kids.|`|3qLIRorjaa	It's fine. Your friend is talking rubbish.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	This is a myth. If you do become pregnant or are trying, don't clean the litter. There is an illness that can effect an unborn from droppings. Get someone else to clean it. If it must be you, wear rubber gloves, followed by a good washing of your hands.|`|frwlypDWaa	No effect on conception, but stay away from the litter box if pregnant.    Google toxoplasmosis for details.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	If the man in your life is allergic to cats it may affect your chances as sneezing during sex is a bit distracting.    Edit.  Hana, you're talking c**p|`|OikNR8Ufaa	this cant be true!!! Sounds like a myth to me!|`|GKJEgidzaa	That is totally false. Your friend is crazzzy.|`|2WlNxDwpaa	i never heard of that befor|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Cats will not hurt your chances to conceive or your baby if you have one. The only problem with cats if you get pregnant is their litterbox, because their defecation can contain toxoplasmosis which is mostly only dangerous to pregnant women.. BUT, as long as you wear gloves, don't breathe in too much of it (Don't huff that nasty stuff), or get someone else to change the litter for you, there's no worry whatsoever.|`|4E2FYEHsaa	That's a crazy myth! It won't. Maybe your friend just doesn't like cats...|`|CuTvFlxTaa	No you can conceive but when you do get pregnant then let your chap clean the litter tray out.|`|TU95i2R2aa	look it up on the internet if its true dnt get worried.and if it is give the cat to a close guy friend.|`|HJfjG9fRaa	Its true about the kitty litter.    Get your guy to wash the litter thingie out thoroughly, then, just to be sure, wash your guy thoroughly.     This should help with both the hygiene issue and the concieving thing.    .|`|lItwBo0Daa	all my family has had cats .. and we are all here today .. i think it's just a myth, i wouldnt worry.|`|lUSknAQtaa	definiely not...otherwise when adopting cats they would give this warning.....u should be fine..take care|`|QK4Yzp83aa	my aunt has 4 cats and has had them for about 10 years, she has 3 kids now, the youngest is about 4 months old, so i'd say you have nothing to worry about :)|`|jK8ZfwaFaa	Yes its true if you have a cat round you, you will get pregnant by the cat.|`|uNplLsZqaa	That's a total myth.

0NdBx2keaa	Why do people think that they must always have someone to hold their hand while doing something new? You can do anything and everything you want to do by yourself.
Lngb8ryFaa	their best albums are their early ones (late 90's)...the new album "we were dead before the ship sank" sucks and doesnt even sound like the "real" modest mouse..    best albums in order:  "this is a long drive for someone with nothing to think about"  ""fruit that ate itself"  "building nothing out of something"  "moon and antarctia"  "lonesome crowded west"    ..their first couple albums were very dark, and somewhat depressing because of isaac brocks personal life problems at the time..."moon and antarctica" is more "happy"......songs like "dashboard" and "fire it up" off "we nwere dead" dont even count...|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	The Moon and Antarctica is easily the best in my opinion. That record is pretty great. Some really amazing tracks, and in my opinion it really shows off what makes them special.|`|AA11710920	The Fruit That Ate Itself  All Night Diner|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	Mr. New England has it right. Perfectly right. Enjoy the music :)|`|rFBypeEfaa	The Lonesome Crowded West is their best, in my opinion. It showcases most of the angles of their sound, too...
GiPinhjwaa	They are my favorite band too...it was actually my first concert to go see them, and it was AMAZING! I honestly thought it was a white guy singing when I FIRST heard them, but its remarkable that he has that voice and they are amazing players, as well as entertainers. I live in Iowa and they come here all the time and I go see them every chance I get. I would love to meet them or even get an autograph from them. I have not yet heard a song from them that I dont love and I dont think they will ever stop putting out great music!!|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Raises hand, been a fan for over 10 years, and I enjoy every album they have released so far. They're one of the hardest working bands in the music industry with a very strong fanbase. I can't wait to see them in April in NYC with Clint back in the band.|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Yo  i'm with you  they're awesome  but my fav is disturbed and pantera|`|eAuKwHBmaa	I do like them although I haven't heard any in a while|`|GNXf60R1aa	I like some of their songs.

I have been a fan since around '97 and I just don't understand why they are not known/appreciated by more people!  I really feel they are quite underrated. I saw them in concert back in '02 and they were the opening act?!  What?! They should have been headlining. Lajon Witherspoon has such an amazing voice, I would call him one of the best rock voices of all time. "B*tch" is my favorite song, but overall the "Seasons" album is my favorite, then "Home".    I loved your question and I love Sevendust!|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Love Them.    Been a fan since 98.  Have all their albums.  HAve seen them live 18 times.  Morgan Rose is my favorite Drummer.    They are in my top 10 Metal Bands.    Favorite Tracks are Denial, Praise, Licking Cream, Black (Acoustic) Face to Face, Confessions of Hatred and Enemy.    That is what Peaches thinks of them.  =]|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i like them. i didnt care much for their last album (chapter 7) but i do like the band.|`|AA12367807	I think you need a new favorite band.

The kind of performer he is its like you can smell, hear, see, touch and taste music. He is an all around performer and artist.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	All the people who cheered that a child molester was found "innocent", those nuts were his fans.  Probably still are.|`|HXpOui7gaa	Yes :)  Im a huge fan infact.  Im 14.  His singin is absolutely amazing.  His dancings fantastic.  His as a person is amazing.  I dont care what people think of him or of us fans, we will always love him.  Hes the king of pop.  And he will alwyas stay on top :)  Love lucyx|`|IHUS8wsbaa	I am a Fourteen year old fan.  Why?  1. Because of his music  2. His albums  3. His vocals  4. his dancing.  5. He had great stlye  6. Biggest selling albums  7. Music videos  8. His amazing concerts  9. His Personality  10. His great looks in young prime 70's 80's and 90's  11. I know he is innocent which is why i  love him fro the rest  12. He is a legend  13. I listened to one album loved it. Went to a disco heard thriler, could not dance to it, so i began getting interested, and soon became a fan.    THIS IS IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER    are you a fan>???

You will probably find that very few people were personal fans since most people are grown up enough to understand that they don't really know the person.    Most people simply like the music he made and that hasn't changed regardless of any disaster his life has become.    I still like the music he made, so maybe that makes me a fan.....but I always thought he was nuts even before the **** hit the fan over the children....so maybe I'm not a fan.|`|aoQppGSQaa	hey, obviously yes! In the world, there are milion and milion of his fans that love him!!!  I'm a huge fan, he's my angel (:!!!  He's amazing, he inspired many artists of today, he is great artist and dancer that wrote the story of music, a legend!!! the only King of Pop!

joP51azqaa	people know who they are, they have been around forever, they're just not that relevant because they're just not that good. sorry to break it to ya.|`|uftgjEqWaa	hello how are you? i LOVE A7X!!!!! and the guy at the top that hates them can shut up.  best band in the world.  period.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Have them listen to a few songs that you think are the best by them. Make sure you have them listen to a song from each album because each album is a lot different from the others.     I really hate the people who are giving negative answers here. It doesn't matter if you like a band or not; if you don't like them you can still give a helpful answer or you can just not answer. I reported those people who weren't even trying to be of help.|`|p6viL2Bmaa	Dude your talking about Avenged Sevenfold like they are Jesus or something.  Seriously, A7X isn't that great of a band.  There are plenty out there that are better.|`|OLCoFKQraa	If they don't know who Avenged Gayfold are then they're lucky, please don't inform them, they're better off not knowing.    (edit) condie_13, I think you're delusional, or just very poorly informed, A7X are no where near the best band in the world, they're not even anywhere near the best band in the US, best band in their home state maybe, but yeah I can see how if you're a teenager and you've been listening to metal for all of 3 months A7X might sound like the best band in the world, like I said, very poorly informed.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Yeah, they kinda suck... and everyone knows them by the way.|`|Uo0T0f24aa	Worst "metal" band ever.|`|BxrXZWn6aa	Make everyone you know listen to them!

8cQzk6KUaa	well the characters weren't as appealing to you in the movie as they were to you in real life because reading the book, YOUR OWN imagination is what you use.    of course it won't have as much information as the book did...movies don't have the luxury of having all that time to tell a story. movies are only what you can see...you cant get into the psyche of a character like you can in a book. (not as easily)    i enjoyed it because you really got into that world of the main character. you wanted her to get with the guy, and were frustrated every time they got close and then apart again. you see that movie through the eyes of the female director and female lead. a different experience.    what impressed me the most was "family" relationship the vampires had, and the reveal that Edward's father was a good guy after all.|`|5451521e221f76559c20e1e48dc8f890aa	0/5 acting  0/5 special affects  0/5 actors  total -777/5  i learned that from watching the trailer|`|GZ5hzewHaa	honistly, coulda been better.  i did like the books and although the movie was ok, it didnt really explin things for people who didnt read the books. also i cant stand the girls who are like upsesed with edward...|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	well      twilight rly does suck        i rock-twilight dont        peaceout homies8D|`|Ne4yyKiOaa	3 Stars out of 5    It had a few good scenes, but for the most part it sucked.

It is nothing compared to the book. It missed all the good parts and so many things were wrong. If they plan on making one for the rest, I will not watch it.

Jacob was good looking :) and Charlie was also bad. So that's what I think!|`|AA12270666	i thought it was okay.  compared to the book it was pretty bad though. it left out a lot of interesting parts that would help explain some parts better. and they also didn't do so well portraying certain scenes, like Edward glittering.  i think that the books are much better, and the movie didn't really give it enough justice.    but i hope that because of the new director, the next movie will be better.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	6/10.|`|AM33tqYAaa	gayness 10/10  plot 0/10    over-all:   -37/10    neophyte, you stole my answer|`|3AAtPzSaaa	i really liked it! i thought it was so well done for a vampire movie and cant wait til the next one comes out!    i havent read the books though...    a friend read the book after she saw the movie and loved them as well!|`|AIJgbvIcaa	A 2.

ryLbKatoaa	It's really good, but also extremely bloody. I highly recommend it. ^^    Also, it's listed by episode. Arcs are groups of episodes that tell stories within stories. I can't think of a single anime that doesn't have arcs. However, with the arcs in Higurashi, the story will start over. So every 3-6 episodes, expect a total restart. All will be explained by the end.|`|MfqHFQwbaa	Well Its very good anime. Its one of my favorites =] So I'm gonna try not to spoil it for you. If you don't have a strong stomach, then please don't watch it. Its not for the weak of heart.   But I love it so much so if you can handle that then yeah! Go watch it.|`|LSn5iF47aa	Well, the arcs (question arcs show the sense of the world where the story takes place and introduce the mysterious circumstances surrounding the village of Hinamizawa. Answer arcs meant to answer all of the questions presented in the first half of the series. These arcs can be considered the "solutions" of the previous arcs.)    Great anime...this series knows how to do horror the right way :P Its a psychological horror which takes place in a village. The main protagonist is a guy called Keiichi but basically you see different people go mad and try to kill the others out of paranoia while it tells you the pasts of the main characters.

If you do use this program, when a movie is finished downloading, dont delete it right away because the way it works is that when someone downloads something, the next person that wants it is downloading it from you, so if you delete it, they cant get it, so please be nice and let it sit on there for a couple of days or so...email me back if it worked or not...guslover2389@yahoo.com or guslover2389@hotmail.com|`|DDCUbMG6aa	It not true a scam.|`|SMV2mHTFaa	phazeddl all the way as long u know what u lookin for

cUF8pNgGaa	Logan gets a job in California, so he decides it's the perfect time to propose to Rory. He does it at the graduation party that Rory's grandparents are threw for her. Rory is caught off guard, they discuss it, and she tells him that she needs time to think about it. She talks about it with her mom, but Lorelai tells her that she has to decide herself. After her graduation, Rory says sorry, but she has to say no to the proposal. She says she loves him, but she has so many things to do with her life right now. She wants to try a long distance relationship with him for now. Logan says he wants to move forward, not back, so Rory ends up giving him back his ring. He looked so hurt :(    So Rory tries to get over the breakup, and gets ready for her and her mom's summer trip. She goes to have a drink with an online editor who she's been writing pieces for. She gets an unexpected job, when the reporter who was covering Obama's campaign for him, dropped out. So, she accepts. Her and her mom have to cancel their trip, because Rory has to leave for her job in three days. She talks about how it could be for like two months, or two years if Obama does well (I guess she ended up covering it for two years :P). The whole town throws Rory a going away Party in the town square (her grandparents attend too). It's pouring, but Luke made a huge tent cover, so everything was okay.    So, Rory and Lorelai have one last breakfast at Luke's, before leaving so Rory can go cover the campaign.    :)|`|o7w3OmZvaa	try these websites to watch the episode:  surfthechannel.com  sidereel.com  thewb.com|`|RGpgswyfaa	she tried out for the show and den got in duh

AA10153769	Naruto Shippuuden won't be coming out dubbed until they've finished airing the end of Naruto (not Shippuuden). There is no specific date yet but it's estimated to release this year. Sept. 23,2009 is the date when the Naruto Shippuuden movie will be coming out dubbed so it has to be a month or two before that... (maybe they'll push the date back like they did with the previous movie lol)  we'll find out!  ^_~!    btw, people who "know naruto things" might not know about the dates... i just wanted to comment on that...      to respond about the cancelling of toonami... I'm not quite sure how this has effected the anime Naruto... but the old time seems to not show new episodes on time anymore (haven't check recently though)  a year or two ago the release date was said to be the end of 2008  of course that hasn't been true  so who knows what'll happen|`|MfqHFQwbaa	Cartoon Network announced that shippuuden will be coming out on television this year in maybe March or April.

Then CN will start airing shippuden,  they've already recorded the english dub of Shippuden, question is when they'll start airing it.    At this rate, if they show a new episode a week, with 11 episodes left and 4 weeks in a month, Shippuden will not start in America until late April/Early May.    Part 1 should have ended a couple months ago and Shippuden should have already started this month here, but the ending of Toonami really put the show's air on hiatus, therefore they started coming out later.|`|NNyLiObLaa	It'll come out as soon as the Naruto series is over, they're up to 209 and there's still eleven to go.

AA10916001	Who cares what a couple of divas are bitc*ing about?|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Yeah, she was just pissed she wasn't invited to sing it. Beyonce sang it PERFECTLY and it's not even Etta's own song.|`|x5ZaTKF8aa	She went a little far but..........At Last is her signature song whether she wrote it or not isn't the issue. As an artist, Beyonce should have known better.  found away to have had Ms.James at least do a duet. In the future, if another president wants to use Beyonce's signature song(whatever that would be)and has someone else sing it, Beyonce would probably be upset.|`|0JjTt1rQaa	yea she did go too far. even though she is the person most famous for singing the song, "at last" isn't really Etta James' song because she never got credit for it. So technically she has nothing to be mad about

Ow1xZ2tFaa	The new season began right after Colleen stabbed Sean.  She dragged him into a broom closet where he stabbed her and she died.  He was in a wheelchair and going through physical therapy, and hating every minute of it.  However, come to find out, he was faking his paralysis and now he no longer uses the wheelchair.  Also, he started teaching medical students the art of plastic surgery and took a promising young student under his wing and he interns at the practice.    Christian was diagnosed with breast cancer and began having chemo.  He had sex with Liz.  She thought he was out of it from the chemo and didn't know what he was doing, but he revealed later that he did know what he was doing.  This caused Liz to question her sexuality for a hot minute.  I think she might end up pregnant, but that's just my guess.    Julia is back with her girlfriend and she is threatening to take the kids and move to New York (I think) with them.  This doesn't please Sean at all.    That's about it.|`|eb988d4a87fb23ff04f368e37ac1fbcbaa	deathcab is right except that liz an xian r starting some kind of relationship ( previews for tonight's episode show her walking in on xian and some girl, telling her to get out and then xian telling her that they never agreed to a monogamous relationship lol) and julia's gf (olivia) died while sean was giving her a facelift or something because she was taking anti depressants which i guess don't mix very well w/the anesthesia.oh and eden came back to get her mother's ashes ( which she then threw on julia and sean) and telling julia that olivia was the 1 that shot her.

You would need to specially modify your guitar to accept the gauge of strings needed for Drop-A without the strings being too loose and being unplayable. You should just get a 7-string guitar to play that low, because the stock pickups on a Squier Stratocaster are not good for metal.|`|uWh6jAWuaa	Fender Super 250L

They took away quite a bit of detail, but i still liked the movie. i would rate it a 7 even though the book was a lot better. The book is SO much more intense than movie, so that's why i think the book was better. i would recommend reading the book first, then watching the movie. If you watch the movie first, then you actually might like it better.   Best Regards!

AA11101361	1. The Academy sends out ballots for nominations to it's members.  Actors nominate actors, directors nominate directors, etc, and everyone nominates a Best Picture.  Then they narrow down that list by sending out another ballot.  Then the top films, actors, etc recieve official nominations.    2. Official ballots are sent out in January to members.  Some categories have rules.  For example, to vote for Best Foreign Film you have to have seen all the nominees.    So, it's academy members.  They include all past winners and some invitees.  To be invited you have to be a member of the filmmaking community, so expert voters.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	1. The Academy   2. The Academy votes      The Acadamy is mostly made up of seasoned actors and film professionals (experts in their field)        From Wikipedia:    Voters  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,829 as of 2007.[15]    Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.[16]    All AMPAS members must be invited to join. Invitation comes from the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.    New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.[17]|`|c31b46d7046d9eab094655368fe0e190aa	I think the movie makers submit the pictures, and the actors, the directors, technician, etc., for a nomination, then the Academy choose 5 of each category. Then actors vote for actors, directors for directors, technician for technicians, etc.,

tLI94qWNaa	"Blank check"    12-year-old Preston Waters is tired of his pain-in-the-butt brothers and stingy parents. One day, a rich but convicted money launderer by the name of Quigley nearly kills him in a parking lot and gives him (by mistake) a blank check. So Preston boots up his computer, makes out the check for one million dollars cash money, comes up with the pseudonym of "Macintosh" and starts to spendin'. But Quigley wants his money back -- it was supposed to be cashed by another man with a blank check and handed back to Quigley. Can Preston keep up the facade? Will Quigley and his goons get their money back? And will Preston learn how valuable money really is?    They use to show it on disney all the time, loved this movie growing up:D|`|yZAcwN3haa	that is correct   BLANK CHECK!|`|bZ99fJVdaa	"Blank Check", a Disney movie starring Brian Bonsall.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	blank check

xpQnXaxdaa	so this song was performed on the CMAs  Song-Cowgirl Don't Cry  By:Brooks&Dunns/Reba McEntire    the lyrics are:  Her Daddy gave her first pony  Then told her to ride  She climbed high in that saddle  Fell I don't know how many times  Taught her a lesson that she learned  Maybe a little too well    Cowgirls don't cry  Ride, baby, ride  lessons in life are going to show you in time  soon enough your gonna know why  it's gonna hurt every now and then  if you fall get back on again  Cowgirls don't cry    She grew up  She got married  Never was quite right  She wanted a house, a home and babies  He started coming home late at night  She didn't let him see it break her heart  She didn't let him see her fall apart    'cause Cowgirls don't cry  Ride, baby, ride  lessons in life are going to show you in time  soon enough your gonna know why  it's gonna hurt every now and then  if you fall get back on again  Cowgirls don't cry    Phone rang early one morning  Her momma's voice, she'd been crying  Said it's your daddy, you need to come home  This is it, I think he's dying  She laid the phone down by his head  The last words that he said    Cowgirl don't cry  Ride, baby, ride  Lessons in life show us all in time  Too soon God lets you know why  If you fall get right back on  Good Lord calls everybody home  Cowgirl don't cry       Heres a link to the video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHmgcnmkr...    Heres another one  Song; You can let go daddy  By:Crystal Shawanda  Lyrics:Wind blowin on my face  Sidewalk flyin beneath my bike  A five year-olds first taste  Of what freedoms really like  He was runnin right beside me  His hand holdin on the seat  I took a deep breath and hollered  As I headed for the street      You can let go now, Daddy  You can let go  Oh, I think Im ready  To do this on my own  Its still a little bit scary  But I want you to know  Ill be ok now, Daddy  You can let go      I was standin at the altar  Between the two loves of my life  To one Ive been a daughter  To one I soon would be a wife  When the preacher asked,  Who gives this woman?  Daddys eyes filled up with tears  He kept holdin tightly to my arm  Till I whispered in his ear      You can let go now, Daddy  You can let go  Oh, I think Im ready  To do this on my own  It still feels a little bit scary  But I want you to know  Ill be ok now, Daddy  You can let go      It was killin me to see  The strongest man I ever knew  Wastin away to nothin  In that hospital room  You know hes only hangin on for you  Thats what the night nurse said  My voice and heart were breakin  As I crawled up in his bed, and said    You can let go now, Daddy  You can let go  Your little girl is ready  To do this on my own  Its gonna be a little bit scary  But I want you to know  Ill be ok now, Daddy  You can let go  You can let go  Heres a link to the music video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=532jxGDRj...

Because if it is what I am thinking about, it may be Tim McGraw's song called Live like you were dying.

Climbing , I went 3.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu..............   etc.|`|K4RWskePaa	I have no idea if this is the song you're looking for, but it was the first one I thought of when I read your question.

U3j7oVflaa	First, try media player classic... it works like a charm:  http://sourceforge.net/project/platformd...    if that doesn't outright play the videos correctly, you'll need "codecs" ...      The correct way to get those is to determine exactly what codec is being used (look at the extension on the files, wmv, avi, ogm, etc) and the properties of the files may also list the codec.  Search for it and go download it...    The "dangerous" and "easy" way to do that is to just download a codec pack...     This will install pretty much every popular codec known to man on your computer, and allow you to play the videos in whatever player you like.  http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.ht...|`|yCADU2qNaa	Well.I have a solution.I too had a similar problem.    - Download and install Realplayer.  - After u install it make sure u have firefox version 2 or Internet Explorer (any version).  -Then whenever u start any video,a option will come on the top right of the video screen for downloading.

UAHjJpC0aa	the companies don't make an instrumental version of most songs  they have no reason to    since so many people steal music these days  (I didn't say you do)    why would they spend hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars,  remixing, re-engineering, producing, mastering a song,   when few people will actually pay for it?
eKyPgEBXaa	Many Requiems are in Latin.  My favorite "song" from Gabriel Faure's "Requiem" is "Pie Jesu" (sung by either a soprano or a boy soprano).    I sang in a church choir called Pontifical Choir and we sang many hymns in Latin; these are frequently referred to as 'motets'.    I am also remembering various settings for Mass (in Latin) by such composers as Mozart, Palestrina, and many others.    If you need additional ideas you may e-mail me.

The Pope wrinkles his brow at the odd question, thinks for a moment and answers, No Dopey, there are no dwarf nuns in Rome.    In the background a few of the dwarfs begin giggling.    Dopey turns around and gives them a glare, silencing them.    Dopey turns back to face the Pope.    Your Worship, are there any dwarf nuns in all of Europe?    The Pope, puzzled again, thinks for a moment and then answers, No Dopey, there are no dwarf nuns in all of Europe.    This time all the other dwarfs burst into laughter.    Once again, Dopey turns around and silences them all with an angry glare.    Dopey turns back to the Pope and says, Mr. Pope, are there ANY dwarf nuns in the whole world?

After the first day, Little Zachary came home with a very serious look on his face. He went straight to his room and started studying. This continued for some time. His mother was baffled as to why he had become so dedicated.     Finally, Little Zachary brought home his report card. He quietly laid it on the table and went to his room to study.

jaCqIkSLaa	I don't know if this is the song you are talking about:    No One Is To Blame - Howard Jones    You can look at the menu but you just cant eat  You can feel the cushions but you cant have a seat  You can dip your foot in the pool but you cant have a swim  You can feel the punishment but you cant commit the sin  And you want her and she wants you  We want everyone  And you want her and she wants you  No one, no one, no one ever is to blame  You can build a mansion but you just cant live in it  Youre the fastest runner but youre not allowed to win  Some break the rules  And live to count the cost  The insecurity is the thing that wont get lost  And you want her and she wants you  We want everyone  And you want her and she wants you  No one, no one, no one ever is to blame  You can see the summit but you cant reach it  Its the last piece of the puzzle but you just cant make it fit  Doctor says youre cured but you still feel the pain  Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain  And you want her and she wants you  We want everyone  And you want her and she wants you  No one, no one, no one ever is to blame  No one ever is to blame  No one ever is to blame

O2hmjOPyaa	The voice-actors in the dubbed version of Chrono Crusade actually talk about the language used throughout the series during the commentary section of the first DVD. Basically, the creators of the series chose to use a dialect that was common to the 1920s (the era that Chrono Crusade is supposedly based in), in order to add authenticity to the characters and setting.

O2hmjOPyaa	I don't believe there was such a character... However, there was one that carried a dust cloud with him, and that character was named Pig Pen. (If you're talking metaphorically, then Charlie Brown is definitely a "raincloud" character, but actually... no.)    A similar character was one from the Flintstones television series named Schleprock, who actually did have a raincloud hovering over him.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	You may be thinking of a character in Lil' Abner named Joe Btsfplk. He carried a rain cloud with him wherever he went. His last name was supposed to be pronounced like a Bronx cheer.

5l2kTANaaa	definitely !!!!!!!!!!!    Although I could not understand someone writing in Chinese , Arabic etc lol :-)    am falling asleep now.....    PS: good thing am typing lol ahahahhah    edit : have to find an old answer of mine........    copy/paste: ( an answer of mine to a question)        Although I studied graphology (with a real graphologist who redirected the money for his favourite charities) for a while but it is awfully complicated. Books out there are way too simplistic.  There are 3 zones ; middle, upper, lower bit like astrology. And many many more details and things to be concerned about. It takes years to become a graphologist.  The subject is VERY vast and very complex. So am not going to write much. Not going to write a book about graphology on here :-)  Everybody knows that when you are in a good mood, your handwriting changes than when you are feeling anxious, stressed out etc. But there are details nonetheless which never change and reflect the core personality.  A bit like an astrological chart really.    Yes ! Graphology can be very reliable in the hands of experts that is. Not your next door lay person who has about 3 books.    Actually it is widely used in some European countries. Companies ask applicants to write a cover letter in their own handwriting. So that all the standard BS can be detected.    I used to have a book ( where is it ??) using graphology and astrology at the same time and found it quite interesting. Unaware of their signs, the writers put loops like a leo loop on the "l"...etc.    And well...signature is always very important also......but it is only a small part of graphology.    But.....I wonder.......In this day and age, people do not WRITE by hand much anymore......they type ! Would be fun to see how a person types then :-)    edit : "bad" and "good" handwriting to the eyes of another person absolutely does not reflect how smart, dumb the person is.    you also have to take into account the education background. Some people have always learnt to write in cursive ( like me) and others in block letters. People who have been taught to write in block letters look more like one another but when using cursive : you see big differences as well as very subtle ones.    Graphology is really difficult ! It is very efficient though but at the end I gave up. It does take years and lots of studying as well as learning much about psychology also which is inevitable. It is incredibly detailed and you really have to have an eye for EVERYTHING : each letter, how they are formed, whether they differ in the text or not, the liaison with other letters...etc..also format, slant, starting from the very corner of the right page or not...even the hue of the pen, density, applied force in some areas.......etc..|`|e7uUfLsqaa	so they say|`|fWclxi9Baa	i hope not mine is like chicken scratch|`|jPoQm3C1aa	I would say mostly about how organized we are.  From my experience, more organized individuals have better handwriting than careless or messy individuals.      That being said,  my handwriting is horrible!|`|He43Uwjdaa	yes I do.

Funny story: the guy who analyzed my handwriting was really accurate with what he said about me, but while I was waiting in line for my turn, he told the girl in front on me that she was gassy! AHAHAHA! If he was right about me, then that girl must have tooted and belched all the way home with embarassment!|`|9qKwTGeOaa	lol I have messy writing, my room and head are a mess. lol :D|`|CYhOr4s7aa	YEAH IT SAYS WOMEN LOVE ME BECAUSE I WRITE NICE AND LIVE LARGE|`|3374675d4d1c946b84751d377b56cc7aaa	YES, mines, might say im crazy or something. know any one who can read it?|`|kd3cIeRqaa	Im not too sure but people CAN change their writing style sometimes easily.

If you write sloppy and don't finish printing all your letters to words that you are a sloppy person who slacks around on their goals/job.    However, this rule doesn't really apply to well.

zR0Dcdevaa	I think that since you're throwing in the case you could probably sell it for close to 600.  I wouldn't mention the "Korea" thing unless they ask though.  And when you buy the new guitar.... I recommend the Strat, but... that's just my opinion.|`|0I6GNzGpaa	600 might be a little pushing it if it was 800 brand new. when you walk out of the store with a guitar it becomes used. and even if you never played and wanted to sell it back youd probably only get 1/3 of the original price. try selling it on ebay and start it off at about 400 or 450.

AA10916001	No one should care what some stupid kid does.    That is why it is not a big deal.     It isn't as though she is the Queen or the President or the Pope.    She is an entertainer. Nothing more. Who gives a rip what she does?     And if someone is all verklempt over what a kid does, I suggest that their priorities are sorely out of order.    I think that maybe "someone" should be more concerned about the economy, the environment and the war that still rages....    I don't see you protesting David Bowie's China Girl video...you can't pick and choose your outrage.|`|k6M48eUMaa	I agree, it is inexcusable, but its always going to be there. It seems no matter what, some people can never seem to fully accept other people's backgrounds/appearance/sex/race, etc. Its strange to think people are still being racist in this day and age, but, theres nothing anyone can do about it except don't be racist themselves, and maybe someday it will catch on.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	I agree. It's really offensive to East Asian people.  I know lots of teens do that crap, but Miley Cyrus is famous and a role model to lots of little girls, so anything she does will be on the web.

You forgot, however, the part where the white executive purposely looks for this kind of horseshit in order to appeal to the widest (whitest) audience at once.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	I was actually thinking about this earlier today. There are a lot of kids who listen to both Lil Wayne and someone like John Mayer. However the way they approach the music is different. It seems there is room for intelligent music in the mainstream, however when it comes to rap/hip-hop I think a lot of people who claim to be fans don't listen to it the same way as some they do other music, but more as a novelty. It seems like there is an implied lack of respect for most rap and hip hop artists, and a good number of people subconsciously enjoy hip hop in the same context as a minstrel show.    I'm not gonna buy all the way and say the majority of listeners have hidden racial complexes or that there aren't highly respected rappers and exceptions to this rule. But I actually do believe this is an argument that has some weight to it.|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	BUY! They're making money on portraying racist black stereotypes as if that's definitivly black and if you aren't that you're b**ch a** n**ga or something. As for the answerer who said minstrel is just whites putting on blackface check your entertainment history, quite a few black performers wore that crap that's how they were allowed to perform for black audiences, portraying these horrible stereotypes. The only redeeming quality to this, if you can say there is one, those performers turned around and made fun of those stereotypes to their black audiences these fools these days keep the black face on. Not all rap, I know, MURS, Little Brother, M9, Blind Alphabetz, good s**t is out there, just gotta look for it. I personally feel as a black man I have to look for the goodness, Common, Mos, hey, even Flobots, Dead Prez (a little too angry for me when I wanna just chill). A lot of black people do have a problem with the way they see themselves. The sad thing is some of these ignorant songs are so catchy, Jeezy's Thug Motivation for one, I hated loving that. But I don't love it as much as MURS or ATCQ, sadly way too many prefer the ignorant crap.|`|uePD9IAXaa	oh **** you gonna get some hate but i see where you are coming from. rest assured they are just stupid ppl chasing the almighty dollar however you will find that no matter culture there are plenty of these types.|`|Csk44wkpaa	mainstream rappers enjoys gettin the Cream by all mean...

They don't care about the message anymore if it isn't about money, cars, hos, and the club.  I'm tired of turning on the radio listening to mind-numbing catch-phrase songs.  It's really unfortunate.  Black people really do have great things to contribute to society, but it tends to be overshadowed by the nonsense.
1SevO7siaa	Yes I have. It started when i moved into my old new house in ontario i was about 6 years old. I remember that house so well because i was terrified of it. From the day we moved to the day we moved out. It was the basement and upstairs. The first time going up the curved staircase i was scared, i didnt know why but i was scared to be alone. Everytime i went up there i would dash from light switch to light switch always expecting to expect some unwelcoming surprise.  My dad and grandma had strong psychic senses, i believe i picked up on it through them. This is why i think i could see ghosts and experience other supernatural happenings. My first time seeing a spirit was actually on the toilet. I was little lol. But i would sit on the toilet and look out the door way of the bathroom cuz it was right adjacent from me. I ALWAYS had the worst feeling in that area (no pun intended). Then one day i saw a black almost pixelated shadow literally float by out from my parents room past the door way of the bathroom. It was all back, i could never see physical features, usually only peach or black shaded pixelated figures. It had no feet and was wearing a pointed hood, it looked like a transparent cloak pretty much. Cold, scary feelings always came over me when i saw it. Usually at least once a week it appeared. The other ghost was a girl that was peach colored, transparent and pixelated aswell. (like a beige shadow, human shaped figure). I only saw her once, and she was the only spirit i saw with a small detail, she wore a bandanna wrapped from her chin around her head like the old ladies wear to keep their hair rollers hidden. She was in the washroom looking into the mirror. She had a kind peaceful presence. The youngest ghost i saw was a little child. Probally close to my age at the time. (this is probally my most terrifying experience) I woak up really early one summer morning around 5am, i layed awake for a bit and i looked at the foot of my bed only to see a beige peach figure (the shoulders and head) kneeling down at the end. I knew the spirit wasnt hostile or "evil" but upset sad or lonley somewhere along thoes feelings. Either way i was so scared, I covered my head under my covers. I was under them for what seemed like hours. At least an hour went by, i was sweating like no other and needed to breath cool air, i felt like i was going to pass out. So i mustered up all my courage and removed the cover from my eyes slowly, the end of my bed was vacant but my sense was still ringing, i knew the child was here still i glanced over to my right side of my bed, the spirit was kneeling now beside my face. I assume it was looking at me, i couldnt see eyes. It felt as if i lost all feeling and heat from my body, my stomach and heart fell to my feet. I didnt want to move at first, but it took me all of 2 seconds after seeing it beside my face to get the hell up and run to my parents room. My father also saw the ghosts i saw. Hes seen the lady with the hankerchief alot he said, teh black figure which i believe to be a very angry evil soul (demon), and the child, im pretty sure it was a boy. The last time i rememeber seeing the little child was upstairs (upstairs in that house was the only place i saw them ever in my whole life). The little boy was in the fetal position almost stuffed in the top corner on the ceiling right above the bathroom door. The images are so vivid im getting creeped out typing this. Im thinking the upstairs to that house had some kind of "portal" if you know what im talking about. This might not be true but i heard mirrors are like gateways for spirits..? No doubt that house had more people living there then just my mom, brother and father. I forgot to mention my dream. I dreamt about the lady with the bandanna, i saw her features and what she was wearing in my dream. She was standing at the top of the staircase right around the bend in it. I peeked around and her dress was white with little little blue, red and yellow flowers on it. Could have been a nighty too. She had no shoes and i saw her bandanna but i dont recall a face still =S. Probally the most bizzar thing that happened to me was when i was playing with my puppy in my pocket i remember that for a fact, i statred talking to someone (at this point i have no momory of this and no recolition of this convo im about to tell you about). I was having a full on convo with the air... looking at someone, talking to them.. i dont rememeber but my mom was there for every moment, she told me about it. I wasnt acting voices for my toys either. This was interaction with another "person" .She shook me out of it by calling my name. I turned to her and thats what i rememeber. The day we moved out almost all the mirrors cracked... wtf is that about. My dad made a beautiful frame and had a mirror out into it. It was fine until the day we left, it cracked, and the bathroom mirror cracked on the lower right corner. I dont understand mayber a coinsidence. Things kept happening in that housr prior to leaving, so i had a religous card blessed by a priest, it was placed under my matress and after that i have never seen a ghost, i tried to make contact and nothing. I have pre cognative dreams (psychic dreams) often or i get a thought and relate it to someone elses thought at the moment (like them sharing their thought in my head, this is rare for me tho)....

Form : Just Me    I loved the way your eyes would get all small and chinky whenever you grin. I loved the way your imperfect, yet beautiful teeth looked when you smiled. I loved the unique way your hair looks when you thought you were having a bad hair day. I loved how so damn cute your laugh was compared to every girl I knew before you. I loved the sensation I felt whenever I would touch your soft hand. I loved the way your legs moved when you walked around the store. I love that you knew what you wanted in life even though it may not be the most prestigious thing.    Unfortunately, I couldn't find the confidence in myself to change and continue going after you even though we both had a thing for each other.I'm not like the other guys.And then one day you just literally dissapeared, and even though you've probably forgotten about me now, it's hard for me to get over you.  1 week ago|`|YTLePvkVaa	Some girl saying please your breaking my heart.

I just hate sitting in the front by the door or in the back by the bathroom/kitchen area.|`|70OHpjySaa	I don't mind the front door, seeing it or not.  I look at the other people in the restaurant and I will try to face the ones that are better to face. I mean if there's a fat couple, I will try to turn my back to them because I don't like looking at fat people when I'm eating.

PYmm0cr1aa	Yeah Shinji fights Grimmjow in i think episode 140|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Yes      Shinji met Grimmjow|`|Syc0F9D8aa	Yes. Shinji fought Grimmjow for a little while until Ulquiorra stopped the fight. I am fairly certain this is the only Vizard/Arrancar encounter shown so far.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	Shinji Hirako vs Grimmjow     Episode 140
WS1rqp0Gaa	The episode is Episode 140.  The title:"Ulquiorra's Scheme, the Moment when the Sun Sets!"  "Sakub no Urukiora, taiy ga shizumu toki" ()     Here is a summary:  As the battle with Luppi continues, Hitsugaya uses a sneak attack with his bankai and defeats Luppi. Meanwhile, Kisuke Urahara dodges Yammy's attacks using one of his inventions, and subsequently nullifies all of them. Grimmjow nearly kills Ichigo, but is saved by Rukia. She is nearly killed, but Shinji Hirako saves her. Grimmjow begins to battle Shinji, and after Shinji dons his hollow mask, he overwhelms Grimmjow. As Grimmjow prepares to release his zanpakut, Ulquiorra stops him and orders all the arrancar to return to Hueco Mundo, as Orihime agreed to accompany him.    You can watch the episode at:  http://www.animeseason.com  http://www.animecrazy.net    It's a great episode so enjoy!!!|`|3XMOrE4Haa	I believe it's episode 140, where they fight.   maybe a little earlier|`|97885a02e914ca0af336380ab86f14cbaa	139 or 140...can't quite remember

On the American side, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Doors, CCR, Simon & Garfunkel and The Byrds. That's ALL 1960s stuff, a majority of those bands continued on to the 70s, though not many.

Lol, but yeah, he is hella good!|`|AA11555988	I am an aspiring magician myself and I know how he does many of his illusions, but still there are some that have me puzzled. One of my favorite thing to do is watch him and David Blaine, then sit down and figure out how they do a particular trick.       Think of a number between 1 and 50    It has to be a two digit number.    both digits are odd, but not the same digits.    Do you have it yet?                                  Are you thinking of the number 37?                                Here's one more for you.          Think of any card in a standard deck of 52 cards.                                                Not the ace of spades that's too easy.                                                      Were you thinking of the nine of diamonds?|`|55b3ee16ac2c0fa6c4fc5400761ec084aa	well let me tell u it takes practice and u have to have a lot of pactients. The reason y im telling u this is because I have mastered the ability of telekenisis ( moving objects wit the mind ) I only can move little things like cup accross the table lifting cards in mid air that kind of stuff. And im not lieing it took me 5 years to master. And before I started to move things I found out that everybody is born with this ability but our body rejects it once we are born. And wat i recomend if u want to master this is learn how to meditate after u got that down and ur mind is free from everything start off wit something lite like a feather and focus all of ur mental ability into moving it. U should try doing this for at least for 2 hours for 4 days every week don't do it every day of the week or u'll get a hadache. And trust me its worth the wait and pactients.|`|AA12055441	yes I've seen it, long time back, and he also showed us how he did all the illusions....... but I've 4gotn how he did it!

d452cd5befad91d2ca8068420a9a97adaa	tabs - www.guitartabs.cc     i like this website no b-s pretty straightforward     to get better?    finger weights  long tones  pentatonic scales  then majors and minors  then if you get really good try to follow some Trey Anastacio scales. Learning "Stash" for the first time is so rewarding.   Dont get frustrated or if you do take some time away from the guitar for just a little while then come back to it. Also, find things to play that you enjoy playing, or jam w/ some jam friendly songs where you can easily pick up on a scale...pretty much any slow grateful dead jam. Darkstar is especially good.     ive been playing for a while now, guitar is alot of fun!    peace out. hope that helped some|`|e49ee493b287b7d98757925efd9cc25eaa	Guitar tabs: Chordie.com & Wholenote.com.

When you hear crazy riffs that fly all over the place ("shredding"), these are basically based off scales that they've gotten really good at.

6b00af2707592ac5661f0775f7fb97abaa	Probably not, but they might enact a law like California did a few years ago, where minors aren't allowed to drive at night alone (i.e. without a licenced adult driver in the car), and have a few other restrictions on them.    It's like they extended the "permit" time... they can drive, but they can't do it as freely as adults. It helps cut down on accidents that way.    Here's an article on "graduated teen drivers' licenses:  http://www.mrtraffic.com/kidlicns.htm  It mentions:    First six months restrictions  You must be accompanied and supervised by a parent, guardian, licensed driver 25 years of age or older, or a licensed or certified driving instructor:   When driving between 12 midnight and 5 A.M.   When transporting passengers under 20 years of age at any time.     Second six months restrictions  You must be accompanied and supervised by a parent, guardian, licensed driver 25 years of age or older, or a licensed or certified driving instructor:   When driving between 12 midnight and 5 A.M.   However, you may transport passengers under 20 years of age between 5:00 A.M. and 12:00 midnight unaccompanied.|`|421dcce2d04218899e188207a7cfb2adaa	Probably--eventually-- Montana is a stubborn state.  It took a threat from the Federal Gov't to withhold highway funds before they raised the drinking age to 21 and lowered the speed limit to 55.  I lived in Montana (graduated 1982) and had my learner's permit at 14 and license the day I turned 15.  I look back now and wonder what in the heck (ha ha Montana talk!) they were thinking giving me and my friends driver's licenses!  With motor vehicle crashes being the number 1 cause of death for teens, I think we ought to re-think the driving laws.  In Sweden (and most if not all of Europe) the driving age is 18 but the public transportation and accommodation for bikes is much better than most places in the USA.  I know in Montana (and other more rural states) it is difficult to get around without a car so I guess a graduated system is the second best solution.

Next is if they get a contract and the cd as a whole gets sold to a bigger label--if they want to include it--more cash. Publishing rights also are another way too. Next look into ASCAP and BMI for further money making if you want radio stations and performers to pay a fee for playing the song as well.

Em criatividade, sem sem deixar o feeling para trs, o Jimmy Page  o cara... stairway to heaven  linda, e ele fez um timo trabalho na carreira inteira do Led Zeppelin. Mas acho que ainda melhor que o Page, no sentido de feeling,  o David Gilmour, do Floyd. O cara  genial, depois de ouvi-lo, voc entende o verdadeiro significado de feeling!  Hendrix  muito criativo, e  digno de nota. N?o gosto muito da msica dele, mas o admiro como instrumentista.  Eu n?o gosto muito do Malmsteen, ele pode ser o mais rpido, mas n?o  o melhor... Entre esses a, o melhor  o satriani, e o vai fica um pouco atrs.  Por ltimo, mas n?o menos importante, o lendrio Jason Becker, que tocou speed metal simphony aos 16 anos (eu tenho o video, ele toca jogando um i?-i?).

65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Nome: Heath Andrew Ledger   Data e luogo di nascita: 4 Aprile 1979, Perth, Australia     Heath Ledger ha molto in comune con Mel Gibson. Australiano, di Perth, classe 1979, Heath Ledger aveva solo 16 anni quando, terminati gli studi, costrinse il suo amico Trev a guidare per oltre 4000 km in cerca di fama e di fortuna nella magica Sydney. Da allora, e nonostante i suoi 22 anni, Heath ne ha fatta di strada, tanto da aver trasferito la sua residenza in California dove, in brevissimo tempo,  diventato uno dei nomi pi cool dell'ultima generazione di attori di Hollywood. Sportivo (pratica tennis, surf e snowboard), romantico (ama scrivere poesie), determinato ed estremamente testardo, Heath (che di vero nome fa Heathcliff)  infatti tra i protagonisti della new wave del cinema americano, un astro nascente con il pallino della recitazione e con un talento spiccatamente innato. Irrequieto e camaleontico, Heath Ledger non ama fossilizzarsi in ruoli stereotipati ed  per questo che ha rifiutato parti come quelle dell' Uomo Ragno (che sar interpretato da Tobey Maguire) e di Anakin Skywalker nell'ultimo Star Wars, appetitosi cult movie che prevedono per sequel a volte interminabili. Cos come, dopo aver recitato per anni in alcune fortunate serie televisive per ragazzi, si  voluto al pi presto scrollare di dosso il ruolo di teenager (anche se riconosce che  stato proprio questo genere di film a farlo conoscere al grande pubblico) accettando copioni pi impegnativi.  infatti nel 1999 che, in Australia per girare la black comedy Two Hands, Heath viene immediatamente richiamato negli States per interpretare il ruolo di Patrick Verona nella commedia sentimentale Dieci cose che odio di te (1999).   Dopo il successo del film, per Heath ha aspettato pi di un anno prima di accettare altri ruoli, rifiutando soprattutto quei copioni che lo volevano eterno Peter Pan. Nel 2000, per, la svolta: scalzando oltre 200 aspiranti attori, Heath ottiene la parte di Gabriel Martin, nel dramma eroico Il Patriota (2000). Un ruolo impegnativo, sia dal punto di vista della crescita del personaggio sia per lo sforzo fisico richiesto dalle scene di battaglia, per le quali Heath e Mel Gibson hanno dovuto prendere lezioni sul campo.  Successivamente  apparso sul grande schermo nel ruolo del coraggioso Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein nel big budget movie Il destino di un cavaliere (2001), film che metteva in scena una curiosa contaminazione di antico e moderno tra armature con lo swiss della Nike ed una colonna sonora rock. Nel 2000 ha partecipato al kolossal epico-storico Le Quattro piume (2002) a fianco della bella Kate Hudson ma il risultato, seppur spettacolare non  piaciuto molto al pubblico americano. Il suo successivo impegno  Ned Kelly, un western. Successivamente, nel film Casanova di Lasse Hallstr?m, interpreta il leggendario protagonista oltre ad essere uno de I Fratelli Grimm di Terry Gilliam..   Ledger ha appena finito di girare in Australia il film indipendente Candy di Neil Armfield insieme a Geoffrey Rush e a Abbie Cornish.|`|96eed6db51e50bb887711b239beec3ddaa	heat ledger .................heat ledger .............mi dice qualcosa ma poco ............ok dai i 10 punti a un altro  ;)|`|ee5e4e91a8f15c671ee8e18277512f3aaa	Heat Ledger nasce a Perth, in Australia, il 4 Aprile 1979 sotto il segno dell'Ariete. Sangue per met scozzese e per met irlandese, da adolescente Heat ama i giorni di pioggia, i film in bianco e nero e lava automobili per racimolare qualche dollaro. Durante la Grammar School, vince negli sport (hockey) e si mette in mostra nei corsi di drammaturgia del liceo. In questi anni sviluppa un amore incondizionato per la fotografia e per la coreografia. A 16 anni con il suo amico di sempre Trevor (da quando avevano 3 anni) si reca a Sydney in cerca di gloria. E da Sydney parte la carriera che lo porta dritto a Hollywood. Tra i ruoli ricoperti inizialmente, Ledger vanta il primo ruolo gay nella tv australiana. Nella serie "Sweat", potendo scegliere tra il ruolo di un nuotatore (la serie era incentrata sugli sport olimionici) e un ciclista gay, Heat sceglie questo secondo ruolo. Dir in seguito "Era l'occasione per mettersi in mostra e rendersi riconoscibili". Nel 1999 Hollywood lo chiama nello shakesperiano "10 Things I hate about you" e da qui parte una scalata inarrestaibile. Mel Gibson, con cui gira "The Patriot" (2000), conia per un lui felice gioco di parole "Ha grande presenza senza grandi pretese". Seguono "Monster's Ball" (2001), "Le quattro piume" (2002", "Ned Kelly" (2003), "The Order" ("La setta dei dannati 2003).  Heat ama la lettura e scrivere,  impegnato politicamente (famosa la sua partecipazione ad un corteo NO WAR nel marzo 2003). Insieme a Jake Gillenhaal sar uno dei due cowboy gay nel prossimo, atteso film di Ang Lee (leggi ?) dal titolo "Brokeback Mountain", tratto da una storia scritta dal premio Pulitzer E. Annie Proulx.

He has spent the past five years trying desperately to sway this image away, but this has indeed been a double-edged sword. But that comes much later in his story. Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia. As the story goes, in junior high it was compulsory to do one of two electives, either cooking or drama, and as Heath could honestly not see himself in a cooking class, he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, there was no denying that. However, the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent, possibly out of jealousy. When he was 17, he and a friend, decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams are made, or at least, where actors can possibly get their big break. However, upon arriving in Sydney with a purported 69 cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break. His first real acting job came in a low budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliche; a teen angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He did not have a large part in this movie. In fact, it was a very small one. The only thing of notice in his role is you get to see him get his lights punched out. After that small role, Heath auditioned for a role in a TV show called "Sweat" (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He got offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, which led him to look for other roles. He was in "Home and Away" (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997). Paws was a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played "Oberon". A very brief role, this did nothing other than give him a small paycheck, but nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to America trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in "Roar" (1997). He could not find any American roles but then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a teen hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000).        What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Heath accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. The Order (2003) was absolutely terrible, and A Knight's Tale (2001) was just light entertainment. Heath has had such a wide variety of roles that he seems unsure what to do with himself next. Despite being a very talented comedic actor, he seems to only want serious roles, which has hindered his career. He is by no means one of the greatest actors out of Australia, but in his brief career to date has suggested he could become one, if only he accepts the right role.|`|2415669982b2bac90f7a6daadedbdb1daa	Il suo nome deriva dal personaggio di Heathcliff del libro 'Cime Tempestose' di Emily Bront? perch sua madre amava moltissimo questo libro. Il padre Kim e la madre Sally divorziano quando lui ha solo dieci anni e il ragazzo cresce in fretta. A sedici anni, dopo aver frequentato la Guildford Grammar, una scuola solo per ragazzi, si trasferisce da Perth a Sidney per tentare la carriera di attore. Fin da piccolo  affascinato dall'idea di recitare e comincia a calcare le scene con la Globe Shakespeare Company di Perth. Durante il periodo delle scuole superiori riceve molti riconoscimenti giocando a football australiano e hockey su prato, ma, dovendo scegliere se recitare o perseguire la carriera sportiva a livello professionale, senza esitazioni decide di dedicarsi al mondo dello spettacolo. A diciotto anni debutta in televisione nella serie "Sweat", un telefilm che parla di giovani atleti che si preparano ai giochi olimpici e dove lui interpreta il ruolo di un ciclista gay. Dopo una parte nel film "Blackrock" di Steven Vidler, viene chiamato dalla Fox per interpretare un eroe celtico del medioevo nella serie Tv "Roar". Arrivano i primi successi e soprattutto un agente che lo porta negli Stati Uniti. Nel 1997 si trasferisce a Los Angeles ma, per ironia della sorte, uno dei primi film americani a cui partecipa, "Two hands" (1999),  ambientato in Australia. Nello stesso anno interpreta "Dieci cose che odio di te", in cui ha il compito di 'domare' la 'bisbetica' Julia Stiles. In seguito, non volendo essere rinchiuso nel clich del bel teen-ager rifiuta gran parte dei copioni che gli vengono proposti (rinunciando cos anche ai grossi ingaggi offerti) e solo dopo circa un anno partecipa alla selezione per il ruolo del giovane rivoluzionario Gabriel Martin in "Il patriota", accanto a Mel Gibson. Sbaraglia oltre duecento concorrenti e si aggiudica il ruolo, ottenendo cos un grande successo in tutto il mondo.

Loved seeing him perform it at the Superbowl too and change the lyrics to "football player"....   Thought he did a great job in the halftime show and I enjoyed it a lot.    Very interesting question.  For me, these are 2 artists that I liked early on and when they gained more commercial success, their music seemed to change and my love for them began to dwindle.  It's funny because I kinda get aggravated at people who say that about some of the new bands now!    I was way young when Born to Run came out, but it was awesome.  "The River" album was what really got me into Bruce and it's still my favorite.  After that, Born In The USA came out and it was just so overplayed.  I like a few songs released since then like Brilliant Disguise and I still respect the artist...    I loved U2 when they first came out - War is my fave album.  I saw them in concert in early 1984 and would have followed them anywhere.  But around the time they started making songs like Pride, I really started to dislike their music.  No disrespect intended but that song, Angel of Harlem, and others like it kinda caused me to lose interest in them.  It's about when a lot of other people became great fans of them though.

Um cara foi l, me puxou pelos bra?os e como a minha bermuda era de um tecido muito grosso o peso da gua fez com que ela descesse at os joelhos e eu estava sem cueca, fiquei totalmente nu, todo mundo ria de mim, tinha at gente tirando foto.

My advice is that maybe you should get in touch with the sport department at channel 9.  I hope this helps you. Good to see that you are a fan of Rugby League.  Take care.
AA12094998	it is belly dancing and to move them fast the move is actualy not to move your hips - bend you knees just slightly to make your hip shake fast back and forth it is actually a knee movement bend one then the other- as your weight shifts back and forth on your alternating bending knees it makes you hips go side to side!!    there is a great set of belly dancing aerobics tapes they are by twins with rhyming names - veena and neena    you can buy them in many work out sections of video stores!!|`|53555c22ad7a81d9ef340fbefd0860f9aa	Well, im not a dance teacher but just feel the music, and if that doesnt work try dance classes, those are soo much fun!!

I love belly dancing.To shake hips, stand with your feet shoulder width apart, bend your knees while keeping your pelvis tucked under your hips and your spine straight, then lift your ribcage (try taking a deep breath in) and drop your either hip.You will find that your knees are kept bent the whole time.To shimmy at top speed takes practice.Here enjoy these videos. have fun!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMEnn0xJ0...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VKlskwm3...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzjQaHjkt...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaiscX0u1...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY0K7OkSj...|`|ca2df29dbbc0bd9760ed6900f46ae3cdaa	you have to focus your attention pn your hips and slowly rotate them or "wiggle" them. you might need to watch yourself in the mirrior to get the hang of this. Focus on keeping your body alligned but enough out of line to tell the difference. The main mocements should be coming from your hips not your chest or your legs. Try to focus on keeping it slow until you get the hang of it...

En esta pelcula, superman, se enfrenta a situaciones que cambian por completo el ideal del superhombre y renuevan al personaje, despues de la crisis en la que se haba estancado, cuando en el comica, semana tras semana se enfrentaba a enemigos que no representaban ninguna amenaza, donde sala airoso de cualquier situacin de peligro y en la que  cada vez era ms dificil encotnra una situacin de suspenso posible de atraer a nuevos lectores. en el comic superman primero se enfrento a revelar su identidad a Lois Lane, despus se cas con ella y tiempo despus murio a manos de Doomsday, pero resucito y con ellos ocasiono una ola de choque que afecto a todo el universo de DC Comics, el la serie Hora Cero.  En esta pelcula, Superman debe enfrentarse por primera vez a una soledad absoluta, pues Lex Luthor (kevin Spacey) logra robar de l losconocimientos de criptos y estos quedan perdidos en el espacio exterior en el meteorito de kriptonita, Lois Lane tiene un hijo de Superman, pero este no da se?as de los superpoderes de su padre, debido a la sobreproteccin de su madre y al recentimiento que ella tiene al sentirse abandonada por superman.  Esto abre nuevas posibilidades para el personaje de los Comics, tiene ante si la oportunidad de ser un ser humano, de que su alter ego Clark Kent, pueda encajar de una manera ms natural en el mundo y como superman, ser un salvador reconocido y querido y adems aceptado y no solo un extraterrestre bueno que nos salva da con da, en cuanto a su hijo y a la relacin con una Lois Lane comprometida con otro hombre, bueno, ella ya no lo necesita, peo no lo odia, Ella escoge lo mejor para ella y para su hijo quien ahora podra crecer en un ambiente sano, muy parecido al que tuvo Superman en la granja de los Kent, y el ahora ocupar el lugar que la memoria y los archivos de su padre tuvieron en su crecimiento y desarrollo, sin interferir con la vida normal y cotidiana de su hijo.|`|6e6b085be3e44ad61bae44453090b0e8aa	La verdad que no, en una parte casi me duermo.

While her dad is getting his hair cut, the girl begins eating a snack cake. While she's eating, she walks over and stands right next to the barber's chair.

At the gates, St. Peter told Arthur, "Since you've been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is, you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven."    Arthur thought about it for a minute, then said, "I want to hang out with God."    St. Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room and introduced him to God.    God recognized Arthur and commented, "Okay, so you were the one who invented the Harley Davidson motorcycle?"    Arthur said, "Yep, that's me."    God said, "Well, what's the big deal in inventing something that's pretty unstable, makes noise and pollution and can't run without a road?"    Arthur was apparently embarrassed, but finally he said, "Excuse me, but aren't You the inventor of woman?"    God said, "Yes."    "Well," said Arthur, "professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in your invention:    1. There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusions;    2. It chatters constantly at high speeds;    3. Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much;    4. The intake is placed way too close to the exhaust;    5. And the maintenance costs are enormous!"    "Hmmmmm, you have some good points there," replied God, "hold on."    God went to His Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.    "Well, it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but according to these numbers, more men are riding my invention than yours."|`|AA10325553	ok.. joke..   how do u make a kleenex dance?     answer: put a lil' boogie in it   lol... hope that helps|`|67912d5f4f7dc2eace7ebfbfcae22569aa	YOUR FACE|`|7f70f4bb93a052db449b0d6a9a9f3028aa	can i lick your toes,lol|`|7badb6bffc606766ddf9387fd5e5cdc2aa	Two old ladies were outside their nursing home, having a smoke, when it started to rain.

Lady 1: Where did you get it?  Lady 2: You can get them at any drugstore.    The next day, Lady 1 hobbles herself into the local drugstore and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms.

AA11193649	A. your question is confusing  B if i read it right your wondering why Seigel and Shuster designed the costume as they did, if so, here is my answer.  1. the red trunks over the tights are to break up the solid blue of the body suit.   2. the S shield started as a triangle, and evolved over the years to the petagon we now know  3. the cape was to help show movement when drawing him going fast since you can't show real motion in a still image  4. i would imagine red, blue, and yellow being the primary colors are why the suit is made of those colors     That is my understanding of why superman dresses as he does... but my personal fave reason is from Lois and Clark season 2. when asked by a time travelling Villain why a grown man chooses to wear tights in public Dean Cain as Superman responds,  "My mother made it for me."|`|8f2d2205f9cbef5b90a1b74f106a5318aa	seriously, i dont know|`|03045e06fe1bdedb4aa4900dea3563d7aa	that wearing your underwear on the inside is so last Tuesday...?

lUe4rReZaa	If you are playing unplugged, the size of the space may come into play, the dreadnought will be louder, but the concert may project enough for a small room.   I would recommend playing them both to see if the concert will be loud enough.  If you are playing them with an Amp or PA either one will be fine.
jLvlcoFBaa	They didn't do any filming in New Jersey.    Remember, it's a movie. It's not real.    It was filmed in and around L.A. and New York.|`|XZecjMyXaa	Why?

The pre-chorus is good, in the first instance it fits, but maybe the second time around you could just go into the chorus (leave out the pre-chorus)? Overall, well done!

aalMSkEpaa	Personally I love death/black metal, but can't stand techno of any kind, not to mention a search for "industrial techno" yeilded no results at all for the genre, so I really have no idea.    If you could link an example, id appreciate it, kinda curious now haha.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Gothic. most likely. as for Black and Death.... ehh... that's a genre of elitists. They don't like ANYTHING. if you ask them, they don't even life black or death metal.    Name a random black metal band  "what the ****, that band sucks, that band is for fudgepackers." lol.|`|AA11916348	never heard of industrial techno...doesn't interest me...but death and black metal are my favorite genres of music.|`|f05a742426c93189e57dc361f1c464a7aa	Industrial is heavy too and I find that appealing. I love Mortiis and Combichrist.|`|5j9gpHibaa	Well, generally, they tend to have similar meanings to their songs. Look at the average futurepop band, say, Angel's and Agony, then look at, say, Sacrementum .. it is striking how similar the feel of the songs are. Both have such bleak lyrics and a negative view on humanity. The whole elctro-black metal thing started out when a bunch of second-wave black metal bands incorporated synths to add atmosphere to their songs. Also, a certain black metal "icon" might have been convicted of murdering a guy, and was only allowed to record music with a synth since he was imprisoned -- and, black metal cats tend to follow rather than innovate. E.g. they intentionally use crappy recording techniques to sound like the late 80s early 90s "pioneers"|`|UAunAKdtaa	hmmmh techno i dont know ehh  i also know of a few people who like industrial stuff, but none of em will admit they like techo. whichi is good..i think that genre is embarrassing to be mentioned out loud. metal has stuff you can enjoy, like killer ******* solos!!!! or lyrics. wtf solos are you gonna find with a mixer?!|`|GG8x2kmfaa	I don't like techno.. But I like industrial like Rammstein.. does that count? I don't know why..|`|LiDHcYnQaa	its kewl|`|UnsZKr4saa	Some of them do.  After all, some DM bands take industrial influences.    Joakim, I call stereotyping and BS.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	It's the smell.|`|e90oXWlzaa	me being a blcak fan i dont really like techno but from wat i know industrial is rammstein wich i like becuase od hte strong voice ...yet if you come to count rammstein as techno thats odd
YtAkmjoyaa	In love, I like no control between both of us, I like us being best friends & lover and love to hear compliments from my lover, who doesn't? haha. I'm not prone to rude/tacky people unless they get on me and disrespect me or go overboard and do it constantly. Spoiled Kids/people. I personally don't mind listening to what someone thinks, I can handle criticism and hope they can handle mine back, or it's gonna be war. Though it will end quick because I usually get over things fast.  More of a Lover than a Fighter. Protector maybe.|`|uzkrUZJkaa	The boys are crazy as hell!  Also very vulgar.|`|5l2kTANaaa	Am not rude and am not tacky...    oh..more later........zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz    I hate vulgarity......but am pretty adventurous at the same time..oh  boy..

Please, repost your question in Books and Authors (go under Arts and Humanities, you shall find it) or Movies. They probably don't want you there, so maybe Jokes and Riddles will do. Just not Comics and Animation.    Is Twilight a comic? Well, it IS comical, but it is indeed no comic.    Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.    Thank you.   Goodbye.    P.S. Do not blame your computer.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Wrong place to post this question. Post this question in either the Authors & Books or Movies category.

AA12393872	Yes--soft porn (nude poses with a guy that is procvacative in nature). I have seen the article and it's pictures that leave very little to doubt that it is her and her intentions. According to the lastest she states that she did it for "educational prposes" but there are no instructions or any education about it! She is naked and having a great pose in leather and chains. Check out the web for the English paper the "Dailey Mail" and see what links from there. She did the shots in Germany when she was struggling for money. I guess her struggling days for money are now over!  Poor Paul!!|`|AA11380900	According to her "people" she did not.  She had pictures taken for an "educational" book that helped people with positions and such.    Well, except for the fact that both people were completely naked in sexual positions and the book had no words to explain anything...  so not exactly sex educational.|`|AA12344445	I don't know, but thanks for the 2 points!!!

c7253e20cf1ab68e19a8a973654c6ca8aa	"Excuses"  By the Kingsmen Quartet    Excuses, excuses, you'll hear them every day.  And the Devil he'll supply them, if the church you stay away.  When people come to know the Lord, the Devil always loses  So to keep them folks away from church, he offers them excuses.    In the summer it's too hot. And, in the winter, it's too cold.  In the spring time when the weather's just right, you find some place else to go.  Well, it's up to the mountains or down to the beach or to visit some old friend.  Or, to just stay home and kinda relax and hope that some of the kin folks will start dropping in.    Well, the church benches are too hard. And, that choir sings way too loud.  Boy, you know how nervous you get when you're sitting in a great big crowd.  The doctor told you, "Now, you better watch them crowds. They'll set you back."  But, you go to that old ball game because you say "it helps you to relax."    Well, a headache Sunday morning and a backache Sunday night.  But by worktime Monday morning, you're feeling quite alright.  While one of the children has a cold, "Pneumonia, do you suppose?"  Why the whole family had to stay home, just to blow that poor kid's nose.    Excuses, excuses, you'll hear them every day.  And the Devil he'll supply them if the church you stay away.       When people come to know the Lord, the Devil always loses  So to keep them folks away from church, he offers them excuses.    Well, the preacher he's too young. And, maybe he's too old.  The sermons they're not hard enough. And, maybe they're too bold.  His voice is much too quiet-like. Sometimes he gets too loud.  He needs to have more dignity. Or, else he's way too proud.    Well, the sermons they're too long. And, maybe they're too short.  He ought to preach the word with dignity instead of "stomp and snort."  Well, that preacher we've got must be "the world's most stuck up man."  Well, one of the lady's told me the other day, "Well, he didn't even shake my hand."    Excuses, excuses, you'll hear them every day.  And the Devil he'll supply them if the church you stay away.  When people come to know the Lord, the Devil always loses  So to keep them folks away from church, he offers them excuses.  So to keep them folks away from church, he offers them excuses.    Encore:    Well, the sermons they're too long. And, maybe they're too short.  He ought to preach the word with dignity instead of "stomp and snort."  Well, that preacher we've got must be "the world's most stuck up man."  Well, one of the lady's told me the other day, "Well, he didn't even shake my hand."    Excuses, excuses, you'll hear them every day.  And the Devil he'll supply them if the church you stay away.

a940d5a2a0018f525b89e8379b0d8f94aa	Voc faz em d do mesmo jeito quem em f ou em qualquer outra tonalidade, embora possa ser mais difcil dependendo da tonalidade. O bend  uma "manobra" que precisa de treino, e mais do que isso, voc tem que experimentar. O ideal  que voc consiga fazer sem esfor?o. O bend deve ser aspirado,  eu particularmente acho mais fcil come?ar na terceira ou na quarta casa da gaita. Algumas dicas::        * Primeiro, tenha certeza de que voc  capas de produzir uma nota simples, limpa, pura e forte antes de seguir adiante.      * Utilize a respira??o abdominal, ou seja, quando voc aspirar, sua barriga deve se elevar, e quando voc soprar, sua barriga de se retrair. Respirando assim, voc estar usando seu diafragma, e s dessa forma voc conseguir respirar com a profundidade necessria.      * Tente primeiramente no orifcio 4. Aspire como se estivesse dizendo "iiiiiiiiiiiiii" depois mude a forma de sua boca, como se dissesse "????????". O bend ocorre na mudan?a do "i" para o "?".      * Quando voc mudar a forma da boca para dizer "?", sua gargante deve abrir-se, como se voc fosse bocejar, seu queixo deve abaixa, e sua lngua vai para a parte de tras de sua boca.      * N?o deixe vazar ar pelo seu nariz ou por cantos de sua boca      * N?o force. N?o  preciso aspirar com mais for?a para fazer o bend. Se sua boca/garganta/lingua assumirem a forma correta, o bend acontecer naturalmente.      Se nada disso der certo, n?o se desespere,  difcil mesmo. Continue tentando que uma hora voc acerta.  Os bends soprados s?o extremamente mais difceis, e voc s os alcan?a nas notas mais agudas. O som n?o fica muito legal.   Uma dica, ou?a RobsonFernandes, o cara  muito fera.

The full song was only played for the opening credits for the first few episodes:    Now this is the story all about how,  My life got flipped, turned upside down,  And Id like to take a minute, just sit right there,  Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.     In West Philadelphia, born and raised  On the playground is where I spent most of my days.  Chillin out, maxin, relaxin all cool,  And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school.     When a couple of guys who were up to no good,  Started makin trouble in my neighborhood.  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  And said Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air.     I begged and pleaded with her the other day  But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way  She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket  I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it     First class, yo this is bad,  Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass  Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like,  Hmm this might be alright!     But wait I hear the prissy, bushwa and all that  Is this the kind of place that they just send this cool cat?  I don't think so.  I'll see when I get there.  I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air!    The plane landed and when I came out  There was a dude,looked like a cop,  standin there with my name out  I ain't tryin to get arrested yet I just got here  I sprang with the quickness and like lightening disappeared     Well, I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,  The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror.  If anything I could say that this cat was rare,  But I thought Nah forget it, "Yo home to Bel Air."     I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,  and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later."  Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,  To fill my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.|`|b9d4d868d15ae6d44ae49109be280ec2aa	Here it is, the whole song: Now this is the story all about howMy life got flipped,  turned upside downAnd Id like to take a minute just sit  right thereIll tell you how I became the prince of a town  called bel-airIn west philadelfia born and raisedOn the playground where I spent most of my daysChilling  out, maxing, relaxing all coolAnd all shooting some b-ball  outside of the schoolWhen a couple of guys said "were up  in no good"Started making trouble in my neighbourhoodI got in one little fight and my mom got scaredAnd said  "youre moving with your aunte and uncle in bel-air"(only the first three episodes of season one)I  begged and pleaded with her the other dayBut she packed my  suitcase and sent me on my wayShe gave me a kissin and  she gave me my ticketI put my walkman on and said I might  aswell kick itFirst class, yo this is bad,Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glassIs this  what the people of bel-air livin like,Hmm this might be  alright!I whistled for a cab and when it came near  theLicensplate said "fresh" and had a dice in the  mirrorIf anything I could say that this cab was rareBut I thought now forget it, yo home to bel-airI  pulled up to a house about seven or eightAnd I yelled to  the cabby "yo, home smell you later"Looked at my kingdom I  was finally thereTo settle my throne as the prince of  bel-air               Open questions in Television   fresh prince of bel air theme song?   where can i buy dvd copies of "Miami Ink" in the philippines?

a940d5a2a0018f525b89e8379b0d8f94aa	Eu aconselho comprar um piano eltrico, que  bem verstil. O Yamaha P-70  a melhor op??o no mercado (custo-benefcio). Korg e Roland s?o marcas alternativas, mas Yamaha tem o melhor timbre de piano (na minha opni?o).  Se os pianos eltricos s?o muito caros (1600, 2 mil, pra cima), aconselho um modelo (qualquer um, quanto mais novo melhor) da Yamanha, o PSR 256, se nao me engano.

Now, instead of the role-model he was, he has a one-night stand and knocks up the hussy. His solution? He leaves her to raise the bastard child while he goes to "find himself" for 5 years.     Undermined a great character!

He is perhaps best known for his roles in the 2005 films The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D and Cheaper by the Dozen 2.    Personal life    Launer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan; he has a sister, Makana. Lautner enjoys football, baseball and horseback riding    Career    Lautner has been involved in martial arts since the age of six. He was trained by martial artist Mike Chat and was a member of the XMA Performance Team, competing professionally[1] and achieving three Junior World Championships by the age of thirteen. Currently, he no longer competes profesionally, citing a lack of time.    Lautner began acting in 2001, appearing in the made-for-television film, Shadow Fury. He subsequently had roles on the series Summerland, The Bernie Mac Show and My Wife and Kids. In 2005, Lautner played Shark Boy in the children's fantasy-adventure The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which was released on June 10 and grossed $38 million domestically, making Lautner well-known among pre-teenage audiences.

AA11262075	Anne Hathaway is my favorite actress and Britney Spears and Celine Dion are my favorite singers.|`|98cae6e33c2cb74735dac9feda52a732aa	Favorite Actress :  Angelina Jolie-Almost-Pitt    Let's face it........ she's got an awesome, slender figure (without looking anorexic), she's got a gorgous face and eyes, sumptious lips, beautiful white teeth, a sultry voice, beautiful hair ....AND she can ACT in ANY kind of role. Most of the roles she chooses to portray are of women who are SMART, ATHLETIC and SEXY all roled into one. She shows audiences how women should be respected ... in a man's world.     I also really respect her as a person. She's been through a lot of crap lately. The tabloids have been merciless. While the media continues to bombard her with accusations and cruel propaganda, she continues to do the really IMPORTANT things ... like making the world aware that millions of people are dying of starvation and disease. Instead of sitting on her @$$, walking the red carpet and looking into every mirror she passes (like other actresses) Angelina walks through third world countries and does what she can do to help all those less fortunate. Instead of "talking" about real issues, she "does" things to make a difference.    I also admire her for adopting children from third world countries. Sure ... there are children in the USA to be adopted, but I think she is making a statement. By adopting a Cambodian son (Maddox) and an Ethiopian daughter (Zahara) she is showing the world that children EVERYWHERE matter. THEY MATTER ... regardless of their origin, religion, circumstances or color of their skin. She (and Brad) love them as their own. What a wonderful example they set for their biological daughter, Shiloh, and for us all. Children are precious. Life is precious. I think she and Bono should get the Nobel Peach prize for all the work they do to ease suffering all over the world.    My favorite actress? Angelina Jolie-Almost-Pitt. Just to watch her out of pure admiration.    If I could BE any woman? I would choose to be Angelina. Plus, waking up next to Brad Pitt every morning wouldn't be hard, either! Ummmmm !!!       Favorite Singer:   Bonnie Raitt    I just love Bonnie's music.  I have for years.  It seems that songs come and go, but I can always put her CD's in and enjoy the lyrics and melodys.  She's got fun, lively songs and sad, thought-provoking songs.

Os cursos de express?o verbal normalmente s?o realizados por empresas de comunic???o, institui??es culturais, universidades etc, e foram inicialmente desenvolvidos a partir da constata??o de que atualmente as pessoas precisam buscar informa??es e conhecimentos sobre tcnicas de express?o verbal, para aplic-las no mundo dos negcios e das profiss?es.

2253307a6cde390091d89f22e97b600daa	The responder who mentioned paying your union fee was correct, you need to do this.    As far as what kind of music, I can think of several labels and artists who have a stately presence that leans toward the mellow and unobtrusive.    1. Almost anything released on Windham Hill.  These artists play an eclectic blend of classical / folk / and jazz instrumentals.  It is wonderfully pleasing to the ears and significantly more polished and professional than Narada records (a Windham Hill wannabee label).    2. Classical compositions.  You'd have to listen to some classical music to determine which artists might match the mood you'd like in your hotel, but I'd suggest Chopin, JS Bach, JC Bach, Vivaldi, maybe Mozart.  You won't want grandiose symphonies, like Beethoven's, or Tchaicovsky's because they would be overwhelming.    3. Environmental audio.  This is becoming more popular.  Just do a web search for "environmental audio" and turn your lobby into a South American rainforest, or a summer garden.    4. I personally believe that crooners and big band music can sometimes provide an elegant sonic backdrop.  Try new artists like Diana Krall (the softest most luscious voice I have ever heard, like fine rich chocolate), Rod Stewart, Harry Connick Jr., Sade and Michael Buble, and older artists like Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra.      5. Enya (the most homogenous music ever, no-one could be offended).    6. World Music for a more ethnic feel.    7.  Some Jazz could work, but you'd have to find songs and artists that fit your place's feel because some jazz can get a little frenetic.  I love Miles Davis, but I'm not familiar with many of the jazz artists.  Jazz Fusion has an even mellower sound than jazz, it would be worth looking into also.    Good luck on your quest!

f9ceb6a35673b66a382d5d18413429e3aa	Vamos come?ar pelo bvio: a srie relata a vida dos 48 (4-8) sobreviventes do v?o 815 (8-15), que partia do port?o 23, saindo de Sydney para L.A., mas que sofrem um inexplicvel acidente areo e v?o parar em uma ilha deserta no meio do nada, onde coisas muito estranhas acontecem...     Hurley, o protagonista da srie,  um gordinho nerd gente-boa que ganhou US$ 160 milh?es em uma loteria que estava acumulada h 16 semanas com os nmeros 4-8-15-16-23-42. Estes nmeros foram ouvidos por Sam e Lenny 16 anos atrs, durante uma viagem de barco, e foram passados para Hugo durante sua estada em um sanatrio (ainda n?o explicado por que na srie) e s?o os MESMOS nmeros que estavam inscritos na escotilha que Locke tentava desesperadamente abrir at o final da primeira temporada e os MESMOS nmeros desenhados incessantemente nas folhas de anota??es da francesa Danielle (sobrevivente de um grupo de 15 exploradores). Nmeros estes que parecem carregar uma terrvel maldi??o para todos ao redor de Hugo.    Logo no episdio piloto, na hora em que a turbina do avi?o explode, a camera focaliza o relgio de Hurley, que marca exatas 8h23m. 23 minutos tambm marca o relgio de Jack quando ele vai assinar a papelada para liberar o seu pai morto e no relgio do pai de Sun quando ele assina o contrato com Jin. Tambm  o minuto marcado quando Michael entrega o mesmo relgio de ouro de volta para Jin. Quando o beb  roubado pela francesa, podemos ver no relgio de pulso de Charlie que s?o exatas 8h23m. Michael e Walt estavam sentados na fila 23, Jack estava sentado no 23B. Locke estava na 42F. Claire, a mo?a grvida, embarca no avi?o com exatos 8 meses de gravidez. A mensagem de rdio da francesa demorava 23 segundos para passar e estava sendo transmitida a 16 anos.    Durante o seriado, o nmero 815 aparece repetidamente: ele  o nmero do cofre onde Kate guarda o avi?o de metal, o dia em que Kate e Tom enterraram a cpsula do tempo (15/agosto, exatos 16 anos atrs), o nmero da passagem do Sawyer, a placa do carro de Locke, o nmero do prdio da CIA onde Sayid encontra os agentes, o modelo da copiadora que Charlie tenta vender (C-815), na bota que Kate rouba de um cadver no primeiro episdio e nos papis apresentados pela m?e de Locke (564-815).    No ltimo episdio, durante o flashback, Hurley acorda atrasado para o seu v?o. O relgio marca 8h15m e ele est hospedado no quarto 2342. Durante sua corrida de carro, quando este quebra, podemos ver o marcador caindo eletronicamente de 16mph para 15mph, 8 mph, 4 mph e depois parando. No aeroporto, Hurley passa correndo de scooter por um time de hockey, cujas camisas possuem os nmeros 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 e 42.    Hurley compra a scooter por US$ 1.600, a recompensa pela captura de Katie  US$ 23.000, Sawyer aplica um golpe de US$ 160.000 e Hurley possui uma fortuna de US$ 160 milh?es.  Mas o mistrio n?o para por a! Se voc entrar no Google Earth e digitar 4o 815 16o 2342, voc cai na Nigria, que  o local da onde o avi?o com os traficantes estava vindo (a droga estava escondida dentro de esttuas da Virgem Maria, cujo feriado catlico ocorre dia 15/8). Mais divertido ainda  se voc pegar um ponto diametralmente oposto no mapa. Neste caso, voc ir cair em um lugar perdido no meio do Pacfico Sul, no meio do caminho de Sydney para L.A.|`|4aa229872527edc224404baad5c56e47aa	eu tenho medo desses numeros!!! hehehe! vou jogar na megasena p ver no q eh q da!|`|b802c8d9931639aca9260f2548450d18aa	na verdade os nmeros foram escolhidos pelos autores aleatoriamente, como est na revista super interessante.    agora no filme esses nmeros nao foram ainda revelados do porque de ser nessa sequencia.    no google earth se voce digitar essas coordenadas, ele vai te mostrar onde realmente est a ilha de lost (claro, de mentirinha) no planeta. (ele fica no meio do oceano pacifico)|`|be25ce71131974305533c719f86f6decaa	Bom.. o segredo paira no ar... ningum sabe o q significa esses nmeros...

We were on a walking holiday in the English lake District - very mountanous area with harsh steep remote walks - you hardly pass anyone on a walk at the right time of year.    We walked to the top of the mountain path, camped over night and intended to walk down in the morning. My friend told me that he had cheated in a college exam and rehashed my work - what was worse - he got a higher mark than I did.    While he was asleep - I threw away his boots and socks so he had to go down the mountain path barefoot. I watched him suffer for the LONG walk down.

Ningum ser boa ou m pessoa por ser escorpiano. H monges de todos os signos, e criminosos nos presdios tambm.    O que ocorre  que as influncias de escorpi?o s?o INTENSAS, gerando personalidade, atitudes firmes em todos os campos - no amor ou na guerra. Para um escorpiano tpico, "se alguma coisa merece ser feita, merece ser BEM feita".    Como s?o do elemento gua, s?o passionais, representando a gua no estado slido (cancer seria lquido, e peixes o gasoso). Como fazem tudo com intensidade, e s?o ligados  sexualidade e ao espiritual (ou sombrio), amam profundamente, dedicam-se profundamente, mas tambm podem brigar profundamente, se esquecer profundamente.    Alm do mais, por ser um signo FIXO (os do meio das 4 esta??es, como touro no outrono, le?o no inverno, escorpi?o na primavera e aqurio no ver?o), herda a caracterstica de posi??es slidas, maior demora na mudan?a, ou mudan?as mais radicais - o que  visto por muitos como "teimosia" desses 4 signos.    Assim, quem  seu amigo ou amor, tem a pessoa mais fiel do mundo, leal como um mafioso siciliano, e, gua-fixo, capaz de manter sua lealdade mesmo tendo que enfrentar a tudo e a todos. Entretanto, com a mesma intensidade e persistncia ele pode ter dificuldades em perdoar eventuais trai??es, especialmente as de confian?a.    Ou seja, os nativos de escorpi?o costumam ser carismticos e intensos, seja no amor ou na guerra. Em geral, s?o pessoas que s?o amadas ou odiadas, pois  impossvel envolver-se com um deles e ficar indiferente, devido ao lado marcante de sua personalidade.|`|e7b8c175b2f9d6d48922a3d127f9fa75aa	Oi meu irm?o e minha prima s?o deste signo e o que eu posso dizer basicamente  que eu acho que o homem de escorpi?o  muito ciumento (a mulher menos) e, tem dias que acordam de mau humor e jogam para cima das outras pessoas.

778b81e1a29d5b4fd46adf73ac8c253daa	Maybe you have either worries or unhealthy conditions before sleep!|`|AA12360662	Let me analyze the dream for you.    Spiders = insect most people fear or just fear  flip flop =  light weapon, help  Husband trying to cover him up = shame, protection     Basically, this dream is about some fear you may have, and yet your hubby was not helping.  All you project him is shame.  You are getting help from something else or someone else.  Flip flops can mean some friends/relatives other than your husband.  For some reason, you husband is not helping you but covering himself up.  Either this is the way you see him in reality which means he is not a manly type.  You are trying to protect him from your fear.  You don't want anything to hurt him.  The spiders symbolizes fear.  Although your dream does not say much about your husband, more or less you are the one who is in control in your dream.    If I am not mistaken, in your household your husband love you very much and like to listen to you all the time.  You are more like the head of the household, you probably make most of the decision rather than your hubby.   This dream you have subconsciously tells me that you are having lots of responsibilities in the household.  You are like a strong woman type.      I could be wrong, but this is how I see from your dream|`|69e950a89fc9632195781d5d76918f04aa	Possibly you and your husband are facing a threat that only you seem to want to deal with. His vunerablilty in the situation and lack of intrest to prorect himself have you running franticly to fix things. i dunno maybe;)

O pisciano  como uma esponja que absorve as energias do que est ao seu redor e, s vezes, isso se torna um pouco pesado pra ele, principalmente se estiver num ambiente "carregado". Mas a miss?o do pisciano  essa, ajudar o semelhante, dividir o fardo. Por isso que a era crist? foi a era de peixes. Uma era de sacrifcio e salva??o. N?o se preocupe por ser emotiva,  uma qualidade. Melhor que ser fria, insensvel, com sentimentos reprimidos. Emocione-se e seja feliz por isto!

I just bought a 2006 book last week for $7.99 and last year I got one for $5 (it was a 1-day sale).  Since the new books just came out, they may be offering a free 2006 book with a 2007 purchase soon.

I had been babysitting for his kids for 5 years by then.  I was a chicken and too scared to tell anyone.  I went to a clinic the next day because I was bleeding and when they tried to call the police I left.  They said that I was really torn up and a mess and had asked me who did this etc etc.  Geez did that scare me.  And i ended up pregnant from the experience.  I never told a soul the truth until my child was 8 years old.  Now I sometimes wish I had had someone I could have talked to.  There was no way i could have spoken to my mother she would have believed it to be my fault.  Go to a rape crisis place and find someone to talk to.  Believe me, Please.....in the end you will be better off if you have someone to talk to about it.  When after 8 years of hiding my "secret" I finally spoke to someone at a rape crisis center, holy cow I cried and let it all out in a massive flood.  The people there listened to me, and BELIEVED ME!!!!   I never thought anyone would believe me.  Do yourself the biggest favor in the world....talk to someone even if it is a stranger in a crisis center, going through it alone is terrible...I know.   Oh and btw...I adore my child..she even made me a Grandma a couple years ago, I look at him and at her and it is sometimes hard to remember that they came from something as harsh as a rape.  And if you need someone to talk to...feel free to email me.

Gi a nove anni approccia la batteria e la chitarra. Nella seconda met degli anni '80 suona e canta nel duo dei "Winchester", poi con la band dei "White Lady" comincia a scrivere canzoni e farsi conoscere nei locali della provincia. Il suo genere  il rock melodico, ma la ricerca di un'identit espressiva continua.     Partecipa a Castrocaro nel 1991 e si classifica secondo. Il risultato gli permette di incidere il suo primo album dal titolo "Nek", che esce l'anno successivo.     Si presenta al festival di Sanremo, nella sezione giovani, con "In te", nel 1993. Il brano, che si ispira ad un'esperienza realmente vissuta da un amico, affronta il difficile tema dell'aborto. Nek si classifica terzo, alle spalle di Gerardina Trovato e Laura Pausini, vincitrice della categoria "Nuove proposte". Di Nek  il brano "Figli di chi" con cui Mietta partecipa alla stessa edizione di Sanremo. In seguito Nek partecipa al Cantagiro: il successo  grande e vince il premio del settimanale "TV stelle" come artista pi amato dal pubblico.     Nell'estate del 1994 pubblica "Calore umano", il suo terzo album, ed arriva secondo al Festival Italiano di Mike Bongiorno con "Angeli nel ghetto". Sempre nel 1994 vince con Giorgia il Premio Europeo come miglior giovane italiano.     Nel 1995 entra a far parte della Nazionale Italiana Cantanti ma, nel corso di una partita, subisce la rottura dei legamenti ed  cos costretto ad un lungo periodo di riposo. Ne approfitta per concentrarsi sulle sue ispirazioni artistiche alle quali d nuovo impulso ed energia.     Nasce cos nel 1996, "Lei, gli amici e tutto il resto", un album di dodici brani registrati in diretta con giovani musicisti, tutti di grande talento. Le sonorit del disco si esprimono con accenti fortemente internazionali e i testi sono finestre aperte sull'agenda di un ragazzo di 24 anni: raccontano con stile essenziale esperienze di vita quotidiana. Su tutto stacca la voce di Nek che in questo capitolo narra storie sue o che in qualche modo gli appartengono. Trova in Rolando D'Angeli,suo produttore esecutivo, il primo entusiasta estimatore che lo propone alla WEA, la sua nuova etichetta discografica.     Nel 1997 partecipa al Festival di Sanremo con il brano "Laura non c'". Il brano  un grande successo e ancora oggi  un pezzo simbolo del suo repertorio e un classico della musica leggera italiana; l'album "Lei, gli amici e tutto il resto" conquista sei dischi di platino vendendo in Italia oltre 600.000 copie. Lo stesso anno Nek partecipa al Festivalbar con il brano "Sei Grande".     Nel giugno del 1997 inizia la grande avventura di Nek all'estero: Spagna, Portogallo, Finlandia, Belgio, Svizzera, Austria, Svezia, Francia e Germania; ovunque raccoglie grandi consensi di pubblico. In Europa ilsuo disco totalizza un milione e 300 mila copie.     La tappa successiva per Nek  il Sud America: Per, Colombia, Brasile e poi Argentina e Messico, dove si aggiudica dischi d'oro con l'album in lingua ispanica.     Nei primi mesi del 1998 Nek entra in studio per registrare il nuovo album "In Due", che viene pubblicato in giugno in tutta Europa, America Latina e Giappone. "In Due" entra subito nelle prime posizioni delle classifiche. "Se io non avessi te"  il primo singolo estratto.     Il 9 luglio 1998 a Bruxelles Nek viene premiato dalla IFPI, per aver superato in Europa il milione di copie con l'album "Lei, gli amici e tutto il resto". "In Due"  triplo disco di platino in Italia e Spagna, e disco d'oro in Austria, Svizzera e Argentina.     Il 2 giugno 2000 viene pubblicato contemporaneamente in tutto il mondo "La vita ", album caratterizzato dalla brillantezza delle scelte artistiche, dalla variet dei contenuti, dalla qualit del progetto musicale e dall'efficacia quasi disarmante delle sue canzoni. Una direzione di marcia attraverso la quale Nek non insegue rivoluzioni ma il perfezionamento di quello che  l'obiettivo principale di un artista: quello di arrivare al cuore del maggior numero di persone possibile, possibilmente con belle canzoni e messaggi positivi.     A distanza di due anni esce in contemporanea mondiale "Le cose da difendere" (2002), 11 brani inediti in cui Nek si propone in una nuova veste di cantautore pi maturo grazie anche alla nuova produzione artistica di Dado Parisini e Alfredo Cerruti (gi vincenti con Laura Pausini).     Nell'autunno del 2003 viene pubblicato in tutto il mondo in due versioni, italiana e spagnola, la prima raccolta di successi di Nek: "Nek the best of... l'anno zero". Il disco rappresenta il coronamento di dieci anni di carriera e di successi.|`|7b3d889d4eecf21e7f2841fa9abbf76aaa	il suo vero nome  filippo nek  stato dato come nome d'arte|`|ad62694d426cd2b7693e20a12c3087a4aa	cavolo klaudia, quella nn  una carta d identit!!!!!|`|0614ce15c0070e8a2df4634b3706ffd0aa	Klaudia ti ha gi risposto quindi non serve aggiungere... sei una fan di Nek? io si, sono andata anche ad un suo concerto...  fighissimo ciao

As such there is no one person to "destroy".    Besides, even if you could, how would you "destroy Edna?"  Kill her?  Wouldn't any bad thing done to her be morally negative?    The best way to deal with the variations of the "Edna" incarnation is to just ignore it.  Even if it "bombs" the BBS with messages, the Yahoo folks will take care of it.      Get some sleep.  Moley, thats what *I* should be doing.  Seriously, relax and enjoy life.  There are people elsewhere in the world today who can't do that.  Appreciate what you have.

7d0e788ef76214ba7ad682b997865928aa	Raul dos Santos Seixas nasceu em Salvador, Bahia, em 28 de junho de 1945. Filho da mesma regi?o e gera??o que Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso e Gal Costa entre tantos outros que definiram o movimento chamado Tropiclia, Raul teve ao contrrio destes em sua infancia maior contato e assimila??o do rock and roll em virtude de ser vizinho e amigo de filhos de famlias americanas que trabalhavam para o consulado americano na Bahia.   Engana-se porm quem pensa que Raul renegou a cultura brasileira adotando o rock and roll; odiava a bossa nova mas acrescentou ao seu rock elementos de msica nordestina como o bai?o, xaxado, msica brega.     Em 1962 em meio ao movimento bossa nova que explodia no Brasil, Raul monta sua primeira banda, Os Relampagos do Rock, que mais tarde teria seu nome mudado para The Panthers e finalmente Raulzito e os Panteras.    Apresentam-se em clubes e algumas vezes em rdio e TV. Come?am a formar fama como express?o local do movimento Jovem Guarda     Com o apoio de Jerry Adriani sai em turn pelo Brasil com os Panteras (abrindo os shows do primeiro) e grava em 1968 o seu primeiro LP, auto entitulado. N?o alcan?ando nenhuma repercuss?o a nvel nacional Raul volta para Salvador possivelmente pretendendo abandonar a msica. Sairia da Bahia novamente para tentar carreira de produtor na CBS onde produziria e comporia para Jerry Adriani, Renato e Seus Blue Caps, Trio Ternura, Srgio Sampaio, entre outros astros da poca.    Em 1972 alcan?ou a t?o desejada repercuss?o nacional    Ouro de Tolo, foi o seu primeiro grande sucesso.     Em 1973 saiu o LP Krig-Ha Bandolo! apresentando as primeiras parcerias de Raul com o companheiro de estudos esotricos Paulo Coelho.   Come?aram a formar em parceria o grupo Sociedade Alternativa, anarquista, baseado na doutrina de Aleister Crowley e tambm destinado a estudos esotricos. Chegariam a pensar em construir em Minas Gerais a comunidade alternativa Cidade das Estrelas. O movimento foi porm considerado subversivo pelo governo militar. Raul (que aparentemente passou por sess?es de tortura), Paulo e as respectivas esposas (Edith e Adalgisa) foram exilados nos estados unidos.    Voltaram ao Brasil em 1974 em meio ao sucesso do segundo LP, Gita, possivelmente o seu lan?amento de maior vendagens e repercuss?o, ganhando discos de ouro e participando da trilha sonoras da novela O Rebu. A Philips chegou a relan?ar 24 Maiores Sucessos... sobre um novo nome, 20 Anos de Rock e dessa vez sobre o nome de Raul. Seguiriam-se ent?o LPs de grande repercuss?o, Novo Aeon, H 10 Mil Anos Atrs (ltimo em parceria com Paulo Coelho), Raul Rock Seixas, O Dia Em Que a Terra Parou.     No incio da dcada de 80 Raul Seixas come?ou a apresentar problemas de sade em virtude de consumo exagerado de lcool. N?o parou porm de lan?ar discos e projetos, Mata Virgem, Por Quem os Sinos Dobram, Abre-te Ssamo. Passou a sofrer de hepatite cr?nica em virtude da bebida e estava em um hiato de contratos e shows.

Sua grande influncia foi o rock-and-roll da dcada de 1950, que ouviu muito nos discos emprestados pelos vizinhos, funcionrios do consulado norte-americano em Salvador. Aos 12 anos fundou o conjunto The Panthers (mais tarde Os Panteras), primeiro grupo de rock de Salvador a usar instrumentos eltricos, passando a tocar em cidades do interior baiano. Come?ou a estudar direito, mas abandonou o curso para se dedicar a msica. Em 1967, Jerry Adriani apresentou-se ao vivo em Salvador, acompanhado pelos Panteras, e se entusiasmou com o grupo, convencendo-os a se mudarem para o Rio de Janeiro RJ, onde gravaram pela Odeon (mais tarde EMI) seu primeiro disco LP, Raulzito e os Panteras. De 1968 a 1972 trabalhou como produtor da CBS. Produziu e lan?ou, em 1971, o LP Sociedade da Gr?-Ordem Kavernista apresenta sess?o das dez, com msicas de sua autoria e em parceria com Srgio Sampaio, tendo ambos como interpretes ao lado de Mriam Batucada e Edy Star.

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?  'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,  Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.  So I took what's mine by eternal right.  Took your soul out into the night.  It may be over but it won't stop there,  I am here for you if you'd only care.  You touched my heart you touched my soul.  You changed my life and all my goals.  And love is blind and that I knew when,  My heart was blinded by you.  I've kissed your lips and held your head.  Shared your dreams and shared your bed.  I know you well, I know your smell.  I've been addicted to you.    Goodbye my lover.  Goodbye my friend.  You have been the one.  You have been the one for me.    I am a dreamer but when I wake,  You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.  And as you move on, remember me,  Remember us and all we used to be  I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.  I've watched you sleeping for a while.  I'd be the father of your child.  I'd spend a lifetime with you.  I know your fears and you know mine.  We've had our doubts but now we're fine,  And I love you, I swear that's true.  I cannot live without you.    Goodbye my lover.  Goodbye my friend.  You have been the one.  You have been the one for me.    And I still hold your hand in mine.  In mine when I'm asleep.  And I will bear my soul in time,  When I'm kneeling at your feet.  Goodbye my lover.  Goodbye my friend.  You have been the one.  You have been the one for me.  I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.

As piadas s?o sem gra?a, os quadros s?o chatos e os personagens ent?o nem se fala. Acho que sobra ali um ou dois que vale dar uma olhadela.    O mais interessante do Sai de Baixo, e que era um program humorstico em que o Improvizo existia. Tinha um texto e uma histria, mas vez ou outra acontecia algo fora da linha e isso dava a gra?a da coisa.   Tentei assistir outro dia a Pra?a, mas n?o consegui por mais de 20 minutos.

Ele tem olhos muito desenvolvidos e por isso enxerga muito bem, o que ajuda quando precisa ca?ar para se alimentar. Suas patas dianteiras (da frente) s?o usadas para ca?ar. O louvadeus fica parado nas plantas esperando. Quando um outro inseto chega perto, ele rapidamente pega este mosquito ou borboleta com suas patas.    O Louvadeus tem este nome justamente porque enquanto espera outro inseto fica com as patas paradas como se estivesse *rezando*.     O louvadeus tem patas traseiras (pernas) muito fortes que s?o usadas para andar, pular e ajudar quando v?o voar. Eles vivem em matas e reas de muita vegeta??o, sendo que conseguem se confundir com as plantas por causa de sua cor e por ficarem imveis por longos perodos de tempo. Isso  importante para que n?o sejam comidos por outros animais, como pssaros e morcegos.     Apesar de serem muito diferentes, os louvadeus s?o parentes das baratas e dos grilos. Mas o louvadeus  benvindo, principalmente nas planta??es porque ajuda a combater os insetos que destroem as plantas.     Existem mais de 2000 espcies de louvadeus em todo o mundo, mas quase todos vivem em locais de temperaturas quentes (regi?es tropicais e sub-tropicais).|`|b802c8d9931639aca9260f2548450d18aa	porque as patas da frente ficam juntas parecendo que ele est rezando.|`|27371bd4371ba4af52e644b2e8cb0eedaa	Porque o papy do cu quis assim.Brinkdera , a resposta certa  essa que a outra menina respondeu, mas sou eu que mere?o os dez pontnhos!!!!!|`|7e414523b90ea69b97010ed72cf29aeaaa	simples..pelo posicionamento das "m?os" em postura de ora??o,lembra a de uma pessoa orando|`|c13c8baff327963ba021c7fa9e908478aa	O seu nome vem da posi??o regular de repouso - a parte anterior do corpo levantada e os membros anteriores unidos, como que rezando (para Deus).

There are a lot of these guys out there, and you'll learn a lot more about songwriting from listening to them. The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Elvis Costello, Bob Marley, The Kinks, a lot of Van Morrison.. All are/were fairly good at understanding what a "song" is structurally composed of. And you'll get some inspiration too.    3) Forgot.. ALWAYS have a pencil and a little notebook handy for whenever the inspiration strikes, or you just need to get a nice line down. Don't leave the house without them.|`|adb58e42d7e82c612173b42ae83694b5aa	"good" can be subjective. First off, what is a "good songwriter" considered to be for you? I've always felt a good songwriter writes what he or she feels strongly about. If that person wants to make a difference and influence people, then that songwriter will write a song that he or she feels strongly about and will hopefully have an impact on someone. But more or less, it comes from the heart, and not something that everyone will agree on just for the sake of winning fans over.|`|87b2f8ae49f1453d1bbbef16ce9e9a81aa	use it as the only way you express yourself.    and live life to the fullest|`|ae25ba48cc60acdc52060543bea380f0aa	write songs, listen to the critics and dont get angry when they suggest something... no matter how they say it.|`|AA11570347	A poetry class can help you learn how to create verse.

e0cd203d4b147a5397f82de93f323a59aa	Indian musicians believe that teentaal is the King of taal-s (rhythms) and because of this I give here some compositions in this taal.    Teental is the most common rhythm used in Indian Classical music (vocal, instrumental and dance music) with all different laya-s (tempos). There are so many versions in different gharana-s (stylistic schools of music in India). I give the one who has written in the great book, Tabla -- Lessons and Practice 2nd Edition, by Pandit Aloke Dutta.     Teentaal is in16 matra-s (beats) divided into 4+4+4+4.    The most famous teentaal theka (main cycle) is:      Dha Dhin Dhin Dha    Dha Dhin Dhin Dha    Na Tin Tin Na    Ta Dhin Dhin Dha       Now I give some teentaal kaida-s. I should mention that kaida is derived from the Arabic-Persian name Ghaedeh that literally means rule.     Teentaal Kaida No. 1:    Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na  Ta Ta Te Te Dha Dha Dhin Na    Now I give some kaida-s similar to the teentaal kaida No. 1. I have composed them some years ago, but it is very natural that some other people have composed the same or similar kaida-s.    Dha Te Te Tu Na Dhe Dhe Na Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Ta Te Te Tu Na Te Te Na Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na    Dha Te Te Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Ta Te Te Ta Ke Na TeTe Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na      Dha Te Te Te Te Dha Te Te Te Te Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Ta Te Te Te Te Ta Te Te Te Te Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na      Dha Dhi Na Dhi Na Dha Dhi Na    Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Na Tu Na Tu Na Na Tu Na    Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na      Dha Tu Na Dha Tu Na Te Te Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Ta Tu Na Ta Tu Na Te Te Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na      Dha TeRe KeTe Dha Ge Na Tu Na Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Tu Na    Ta TeRe KeTe Ta Ke Na Tu Na Dha Dha Te Te Dha Dha Dhi Na    Teentaal Kaida No. 2:    Dha Te Te Dha Te Te Dha Dha Te Te Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Te Te Ta Te Te Ta Ta Te Te Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    This is a very famous kaida and there are lots of different variations. So it is better to refer to the books and I give only two similar kaida-s.      Te Te Dha Te Te Dha Te Te Te Te Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Te Te Ta Te Te Ta Te Te Te Te Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    Dha Te Te Te Te Dha Te Te Te Te Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Te Te Te Te Ta Te Te Te Te Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    In this kaida I have not used the same phrases such as Dha Te Te & Dha Dha Te Te but structurally it is similar to the kaida No. 2.    Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Na Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Ta Ke Na Ta Ke Na Na Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Similar to kaida No. 2 it is possible to compose lots of different variations. But I only give one:    Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Dha -- Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Dha --    Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Na Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Ta Ke Na Ta -- Ta Ke Na Ta Ke Na Ta --    Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Dha Ge Na Na Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na       Teentaal Kaida No. 3:      "Ustad Habibuddin Khan had two styles, which is easy to understand because his father, Shammu Khan of Ajrara School, with whom he started learning, died only four years after his institution. As a result, he continued his studies with Natthu Khan of the Delhi School. For example he played a kaida, from Delhi, which goes as follows:    Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na  Ta Ke Na Te Te Ta Ke Na Te Te Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na"    I give some kaida-s similar to kaida No. 3, which I have composed them some years ago. Again I emphasize that it is quite natural that the same or similar kaida-s have been composed by other people.    Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Te Te Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Te Te Ta Te Te Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    Tu Na Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ge Na Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Tu Na Ta Ke Na Te Te Dha Ge Na Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Dha Ge Na Te Te Te Te Dha Ge Na Te Te Te Te Dha Ti    Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Te Te Te Te Ta Ke Na Te Te Te Te Dha Ti    Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ge Na Te Te Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Teentaal Kaida No. 4:    Dha Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Ta Ti Ta Ke Na Ta Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    Ending a teentaal kaida with the phrases "Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na" and similarly "Ta Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na" is so popular in Indian tabla solo recitals.      Here I give some samples:      Dha Ge Na Na Ti Dha Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Na Ti Ta Ke Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Ka Ta Dha Ti Dha Ge Na Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ka Ta Ta Ti Ta Ke Na Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Dha Ge Na Dha TeRe KeTe Dhe Te Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ke Na Ta TeRe KeTe The Te Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Dha Na Tu Na Dha Tu Na Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Na Tu Na Ta Tu Na Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na      Dha -- TeRe KeRe Dhe Te Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta -- TeRe KeRe The Te Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    Teentaal Kaida No. 5:      Tu Na Dha Ge Na Tu Na Dha Ge Na Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Tu Na Ta Ke Na Tu Na Ta Ke Na Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na       Teentaal Kaida No. 6:      Dha Ti Dha Ge Na Dha Ti Dha Ge Na Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ti Ta Ke Na Ta Ti Ta Ke Na Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na    Teentaal Kaida No. 7:    Dha Dha Te Te Dha Ge Na Dha TeRe KeTe Dha Ga Tu Na Ke Na    Ta Ta Te Te Ta Ke Na Ta TeRe KeTe Dha Ga Dhi Na Ge Na   |`|f94a293ac65ea5a76abcf142a104bc09aa	No idea what it is sorry

With power chords you are just playing a 5th Chord which is limiting.  For example if you are playing a C power chord it will fit with a C major chord or a C minor chord, but when you get into diminished chords and augmented chords a power chord won't work, because those type of chords do not have a 5th, so therefore they would clash.  Now if you are reffering to punk then power chords are all you have to know with the occasional triad chord.  As far as Jazz and more complex forms of music just knowing power chords won't cut it.|`|36d5ef7ea195b4391142ccf42b791dafaa	yes|`|dcb9c5c77b50a4b08f2196d9a07cafb4aa	yes and no.  yes, but you would need to use a capo to change keys.  no, using a capo limits the use of the full fret board which could affect your ability to play all of the notes in a song written with power chords, and the chords may not have the exact same sound.  power chords are easier to play than basic chords.  you should learn that technique if you want to learn popular music.

e0cd203d4b147a5397f82de93f323a59aa	FIRST OF ALL: Do not run any programs or work on any programs while writing a CD. You might even want to reboot the computer first to be safe.   Do not create a CD using files that are stored on the network (e.g. your H: drive). They must be copied to the local D: drive. Networks are unreliable in speed and throughputs and CD writing needs dedication!     Use D:\CDStorge to store your files for writing to CD. You can delete files from CDStorage to start clean but DON'T delete all files in all folders on D:\.     You can use ftp to put your files into the D:\CDStorage drive (see FTP HOWTO). If you are duplicating a CD, use Easy Creator CD Copier (see picture under  7). Insert your CD in the CD-RW drive with the greenish side down.     Even the screen saver even needs to be turned off. To make sure, click anywhere on the desktop background. On the pop-up menu, select Properties. In Display Properties windows, select Screen Saver tab. In the box under Screen Saver select (None).     From the light gray taskbar at the very bottom of the screen, click on the Easy CD Creator icon (far bottom right corner of screen ) or go through Start, Programs, Roxio Easy CD Creator 5, Applications, Project Selector.    The following Easy Creator menu will appear. If your screen doesn't look the same as below, position your cursor over the "make a data CD" button.       SET EASY CD CREATOR PARAMETERS   On the Easy CD creator menu, select Data CD (assuming you are not simply duplicating a CD).     On the next screen, select File and then CD Project Properties. Under General tab, enter the label you want in the Volume Label box. Spaces and dashes are NOT allowed in the volume label but letters and numbers are.     Leave default File System set to JOLIET.     At the bottom of this window select the MODE 1: CDROM bulleted item. ( The Automatically import previous session box is checked if you want to include the data already on the CD-R. Otherwise, any data already on the CD-R will not be visible after recording the current session.) . Click OK at the bottom of the screen to continue.     SELECT FILES TO WRITE TO CD AND PREPARE TO WRITE   The top half of the DATA CD Layout window is very much like Windows Explorer. Highlight the desired files or folders in the top half of the window. Click on Edit, then Copy.     In the bottom half of the windows, highlight the Volume label of the CD-R, then click Edit, Paste.     Disk space usage appears in the bottom gray box of the window detailing approximately how much of the 650MB of CD space will be used by the files you've selected.     Prepare the layout for writing by selecting File, the Validate Project.     WRITING THE CD-R   From menu bar, select File, then Record CD.     Under Advanced tab you can choose to test-write CD-R. This is safest route but takes twice as long to write the CD.     Click the OK button. The CD creation Process will begin and a check of the data transfer rate will occur.   -----------------  Hope this helps.|`|a72e96b425ddbe0676ea9fe6e450eea4aa	u need a cd burner for tat..|`|aad47fa01b974d8620677fcfa32e8d12aa	you have to have the part on the moniter or the other part has to have a part where you can put a cd in then when you find that contact me and i will tell you the rest what 2 do|`|4f05ad132431f3d6a4d732c062645525aa	u can burn a disc through iTunes  hope it helps . . .

AA11241780	A  woman sitting at a roadhouse in Top Springs, NT, suddenly    began to cough while eating a giant outback steak.    After a few seconds it became apparent that she was in real    distress and two Jackaroos at the next table turned to look at her.      "Can ya swalla?", asked one Jackaroo.     The woman signalled "No", desperately shaking her head.     "Can ya breathe?", asked the other.     The woman, beginning to turn blue, shook her head "No".     With that, the first Jackaroo raced over to her, lifted up the     back of her skirt, yanked down her panties, and slowly ran his tongue up    and down the woman's butt crack.     This shocked the woman into such a violent spasm that the     obstruction flew out of her mouth and she began to breathe again.     The Jackaroo walked back over to his mate and proudly took another     drink of his VB. His mate said in admiration,     "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Manoeuvre, but I     ain't never seen nobody do it before".     :)|`|489b4d5387a21e69304c4804e1641aaaaa	The hospital decided to transfer a few of retarded people to another hospital in a helicopter.

He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.    Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured Sis must be getting sick, because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just the way the doctor would. Except hes not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and gettin all out of breath. His other hand must of been cold because he put it under her skirt.     About this time Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I found out what was making them so sick  a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she got really scared  her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one shes ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake.     Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were dripping out.     Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasnt dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats  they have nine lives or something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Siss boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.|`|6bca1d98592cce7bc733f548e9fbc55caa	Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself 'She'll never go for me carrying on like that,' so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans, and shortly after that they got married.   A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings of baked beans. All the way home he farted. He 'putted' down one hill and 'putt-putted' up the next. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.     His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, 'Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!' She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to answer the phone.     While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but *ripe* as a rotten egg.     He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and 'rrriiiipppp!' It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming. He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real blue ribbon winner; the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin.     When he heard the 'phone farewells' (indicating the end of his loneliness and freedom) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. After assuring her he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled, 'Surprise!'     To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.|`|eaca171459e505b0899e0ddf59cab80faa	wait a second  After just a few years of marriage, filled with constant arguments, a young man and his wife decided the only way to save their marriage was to try counselling. They had been at each other's throat for some time and felt that this was their last straw.  When they arrived at the counsellor's office, the counsellor jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion.  "What seems to be the problem?"    Immediately, the husband held his long face down without anything to say. On the other hand, the wife began talking 90 miles an hour describing all the wrongs within their marriage.    After 5 - 10 - 15 minutes of listening to the wife, the counsellor went over to her, picked her up by her shoulders, kissed her passionately for several minutes, and sat her back down. Afterwards, the wife sat there speechless.  He looked over at the husband who was staring in disbelief at what had happened.    The counsellor spoke to the husband, "Your wife NEEDS that at least twice a week!"    The husband scratched his head and replied, "I can have her here on Tuesdays and Thursdays."        A woman in her 40's went to a plastic surgeon for a face-lift. The surgeon told her about a new procedure called "The Knob" where a small knob is placed on the back of a woman's head and can be turned to tighten up her skin to produce the effect of a brand new face lift.  Of course, the woman wanted "The Knob". Over the course of the years, the woman tightened the knob and the effects were wonderful. The woman remained young looking and vibrant.  After fifteen years, the woman returned to the surgeon with two problems.    "All of these years, everything has been working just fine. I've had to turn the knob many times and I've always loved the results. But now I've developed two annoying problems: First, I have these terrible bags under my eyes and the knob won't get rid of them."    The doctor looked at her closely and said, "Those aren't bags, those are your breasts."    She sighed and said, "Well, I guess there's no point in asking about the goatee..."        Are you ready for children?    Are you considering having children? To determine whether you are truly prepared for the experience, we suggest you take this set of simple tests...    ** MESS TEST:  Smear peanut butter on the sofa and curtains. Now rub your hands in the wet flower bed and rub on the walls. Cover the stains with crayons. Place a fish stick behind the couch and leave it there all summer.    ** TOY TEST:  Obtain a 55-gallon box of Legos. (If Legos are not available, you may substitute roofing tacks or broken bottles.) Have a friend spread them all over the house. Put on a blindfold. Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen. Do not scream (this could wake a child at night).    ** GROCERY STORE TEST:  Borrow one or two small animals (goats are best) and take them with you as you shop at the grocery store. Always keep them in sight and pay for anything they eat or damage.    ** DRESSING TEST:  Obtain one large, unhappy, live octopus. Stuff into a small net bag making sure that all arms stay inside.    ** FEEDING TEST:  Obtain a large plastic milk jug. Fill halfway with water. Suspend from the ceiling with a stout cord. Start the jug swinging. Try to insert spoonfuls of soggy cereal (such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios) into the mouth of the jug while pretending to be an airplane. Now dump the contents of the jug on the floor.    ** NIGHT TEST:  Prepare by obtaining a small cloth bag and fill it with 8 to 12 pounds of sand. Soak it thoroughly in water. At 8:00 PM begin to waltz and hum with the bag until 9:00 PM. Lay down your bag and set your alarm for 10:00 PM. Get up, pick up your bag, and sing every song you have ever heard. Make up about a dozen more and sing these too until 4:00 AM. Set alarm for 5:00 AM. Get up and make breakfast. Keep this up for five years. Look cheerful.    ** PHYSICAL TEST (WOMEN):  Obtain a large beanbag chair and attach it to the front of your clothes. Leave it there for 9 months. Now remove 10% of the beans.    ** PHYSICAL TEST (MEN):  Go to the nearest drug store. Set your wallet on the counter. Ask the clerk to help himself. Now proceed to the nearest food store. Go to the head office and arrange for your paycheck to be directly deposited to the store. Purchase a newspaper. Go home and read it quietly for the last time.    ** FINAL ASSIGNMENT:  Find a couple who already have a small child. Lecture them on how they can improve their discipline, patience, tolerance, toilet training, and child's table manners. Suggest many ways they can improve. Emphasize to them that they should never allow their children to run riot. Enjoy this experience. It will be the last time you will have all the answers.|`|8bbee3da795f49d052ab6c333198f309aa	one man was passing through an accident side.he saw one man screaming with pain saying "Oh god , i have lost  my hand ".

AA12254014	but this time bush adopt some sophisticated methods  and not do Iraq that is why he already sent signals to Cubans to adopt multi party system. history tells us that the heads of the countries of socialistic patter of societies die, those countries embraced capitalism. examples are china after Mao, Russia after Stalin Yugoslavia after Stalin and other east European countries. the reason is instead of collective proletariat dictatorship advocated by Karl Marx they were in the grip of individual dictators and as soon as they died the entire political system failed. i don't think Raul would handle efficiently Cuban affairs efficiently as Fidel did who still is the only charismatic and outstanding icon of revolution to most of the under privileged countries. i hope he lives for another 100 years.the USA is more interested in recently found oil in Cuba. it would lure new rulers that it would lift all economic sanctions imposed on it if it follows the path suggested by bush and rice.|`|04a0c9f92aba6de369e376602d4151faaa	Stop repeating your question.|`|AA11746917	Wait?
