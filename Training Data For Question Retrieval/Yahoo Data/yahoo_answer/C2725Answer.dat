The Congo needs to be in a shoal of at least 6, you don't have the room for this, rehome the Congo.<br>  <br>  Are the Mollies male/female or all male or all female? If you have a mix of sexes they can fill a 29 gallon alone. In a single spawn a female can produce over 40 fry, multiply that as happening every 28 days or so and you see the problem!<br>  <br>  What species of Gourami exactly? Male Gouramis fight each other.<br>  <br>  It's Rasboras not Raspas, they need to be in bigger shoals too.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your penticola is, does it have another name, or a latin name would be better?|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	The rule of thumb is 1 inch fish per 1 gallon of water.|`|O1VcREmJaa	You are definitely overstocked. Your first answer telling you a rule of thumb is definitely correct. It is one inch per gallon and you ALWAYS need to go buy the fish's adult size not the size they currently are.Mollies get to 2 or 3 inches I believe so they alone should have a minimum of 16 to 24 gallons which is almost your entire tank. Gouramis size depends on the type because there are several dwarf guaramis but even they need a minimum of 3 gallons each. So yes seeing as I have only talked about 2 of the 5 types of fish and numbers present in your tank I would definitely say its overstocked and possibly try moving some to another tank or even donating them.|`|GGbd1Bcgaa	Yep. I think so.|`|aFslyRbMaa	well not realy but danger mollies will make babies

Um8osMNuaa	Normally it's due to boredom, and in some breeds such as the English Bull Terrier it can turn into OCD, (obsessive compulsive disorder), they will obsessively chase their tail until they collapse from exhaustion.<br>  My 7 months old pup will chase his tail, but since l've increased his exercise he's stopped doing it.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Every dog does that - they see something out of the corner of their eye & think they can get to it, but it's attached to them, so they just go round & round & round til they get fed up.|`|Ds2pTMyzaa	There are a number of dog lovers and experts who believe that dogs chase their tails for one reason. The dogs are bored. Essentially, there is nothing going on that captures the dog’s attention. When the animal catches sight of the tail on the edges of the line of vision, the movement captures the attention of the dog. The idea that the tail is attached is not really a consideration, but the movement and the chance for some physical and mental activity is attractive. If your dogs chase their tails frequently, it may be time to provide some other amusements that will occupy the pet’s attention|`|iOmi2JAtaa	i worked in re homing kennels for spca and a lot of our dogs with us a long time used to do this out of boredom as they were confined for too many hours. not usually a good sign to be honest|`|f1SWISQYaa	LOL he/she is playing|`|J10eYdIAaa	haha , it's so funny when they do this .<br>  i don't know , sorry :||`|3MrPueEvaa	it prolly has nothing better to do =P Dogs find anything that they could play around with and that is also fun.

His poo might turn a bit orange, but ... it's not harmful.<br>  <br>  I give my dog baby carrots all the time.  He loves them.  I also give him apple quarters to much on.  He loves those too.  Just don't give them too much and if you see them throwing up or getting the poos from it, stop, but both carrots and apples are BETTER treats than say a ... nasty old store bought milk bone.|`|tX27e0UFaa	baby carrots are a perfect treat! you are doing great and not over feeding him... that is so important. If he likes them keep it up... feed him as much as you think he can take. If its too much he will probably vomit and then back off. 2-3 is probably just right for him..|`|O4jGlC2caa	Baby carrots are fine.  <br>  <br>  However, it's not going to save your puppy from the fact it is a teacup.

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Ideally, they should not vomit at all, but once in a while they do get sick.  They can vomit a lot if they have just eaten.  Some vomit yellow bile or a foamy substance.  Either way, if your dog is vomiting several times in one day, it's time to see the vet.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Dogs don't throw up on a regular basis unless they are ill or their food disagrees with them. If your dog is not ill, its almost a certainty that he has a digestion problem because he, like thousands of dogs cannot tolerate grain.<br>  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. .|`|AA11244754	There is NO way anybody can answer that because it depends on the dog!|`|mOFShz3Eaa	dogs shouldnt throw up at all. if they do it could be from something they ate or something more serious. abviously little dogs have little puddles of spew and biger dogs have bigger piles not too sure what you were asking hope this helps... i think you need to add a little more detail.|`|MwqcsiTDaa	It's not healthy for a dog to regularly or even frequently vomit. If anything, it's random or due to an illness, something they ate that didn't settle, or an allergic reaction. This will also determine how much the dog will vomit.|`|KuUx34hCaa	it depends on what the reason is if it's tonsillitis it's usually a little form with yellow bile if it is a digestive problem it could range from little to ever thing that has been eaten BUT NO matter the dog NEEDS to be taken to a VET immediately hopes this helps
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You are an angel for rescuing him!  Bless your big ol heart!  Not many people would take that risk.  Most also don't want to put the time or effort into it - as you can tell!<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  I have rescued a couple of dogs from being euthanized, but not from aggression.  Just because their "time was up".|`|1gbR22CRaa	Not ALL shelters believe these dogs are completely unrehabilitable. They just don't have the time or resources available. Not only that but they have the public's safety to consider. As much as I love dogs, no animal is worth the safety of a person's life.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Nope,I'm not interested in "saving" nasty dogs. <br>  I find it a waste of time money & effort that could be put toward GOOD dogs.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	It depends on where you live... some try to rehabilitate an aggressive animal... or foster it out to someone who is studied in working with aggressive animals.<br>  <br>  however, there is a problem many shelters face. If they adopt out an animal that bites a child or their new owner... THEY would be liable... and shelters are very low funded as they live off donations, as it is.<br>  <br>  You say yourself that a year later your dog can still snap... what if he snaps on a child visiting you? What if he snaps on a friend?<br>  <br>  Depending on the level of aggression, many shelters can not afford to take that chance. This is why many shelters decide to euthanise aggressive animals. <br>  <br>  It also depends on the TYPE of dog. Bigger dogs that are more capable of killing someone vs. smaller dogs...<br>  <br>  It also depends on the REASON they are aggressive. Lack of socialization vs. severe abuse/used for dog fighting.<br>  <br>  There are many shelters that do try to rehabilitate depending on the level of aggression and reason for aggression... but there aren't enough around America right now, that are capable of doing this.<br>  <br>  This could change if donations are more generous giving shelters more moving room to hire out aggression/behavior specialists, and place them with knowledgeable behavior specialist foster parents.|`|HMcVdOrUaa	I rescued a yorkie 2 years ago that the shelter was going to put down because she bit the vet at the shelter. We kept her for a year to retrain her.  We adopted her to a family with 2 children and cats!  She has been there for 7 months now and the family is estatic!<br>  <br>  I think the shelters label the dogs biters then put them down because they do not have the time to work with them.  My local shelter (Bakersfield, CA USA) calls me for yorkie rescue whenever they are going to have to put one down...usually because they are hurt, biters or old.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	I was in your same boat buddy. I rescued a Beagle/Rottweiler mix from a high kill shelter. As soon as it understood who his family was, what the ground rules were, and that we weren't there to hurt him, he was fine. This dog is literally the greatest dog in the world. He gets a long with every single other living creature, even my ex wife!<br>  Dogs are incapable of just "being aggressive." <br>  The misnomer comes from the upbringing of said animal and the reinforcement of the stereotype by brutish owners and scared people. Show the dog you're not afraid of it, treat it with respect, and it'll be fine.<br>  Most "aggressive dogs" are only trying to protect their master, it's just what they do. Dogs can be easily scared, undernourished, or have behavioral issues that can lead to nipping or biting, (all subjective to their care) but it's rarely, if ever, the dogs fault. <br>  Best of luck to ya, and I'm glad to hear all is well.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I didn't say all dogs, I said most. I was a vet tech for 2 years and I've heard first hand accounts from Veterinary and Obedience specialists that swear by what I've said. I don't believe you, or anyone who answered has any other factual knowledge to back up their claims.<br>  I back up mine with first hand experience and and expert testimony. Obviously human life is more valuable than ANY dog's life, but it's unfair to the animal to label the ENTIRE breed as a whole, hands down, "aggressive." Do some damn research people and use your brain.|`|mpb07ADUaa	While there are perfectly non-aggressive dogs waiting on death row? No. <br>  <br>  Despite your "hard work" with this dog, the dog is still a liability. What if he bites a visitor? What if it is a child? Your efforts certainly have not paid off, your heart was in the right place, but your mind wasn't. <br>  <br>  The reason aggressive dogs are not adopted out is because if the dog bites, attacks or kills someone, the shelter will be held responsible. Whatever shelter it was that allowed you this dog, it was stupid on their part.|`|4rwouQHOaa	Here here Bub.<br>  <br>  No, I would never risk the life of another human to make myself feel better for adopting a "poor doggie that would have been killed". Far to many GOOD dogs in need of homes to take that risk.|`|JLayHNZCaa	No, I love my family and friends too much to risk them being bitten by an aggressive dog.  Hope you don't regret your gesture.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Thank you for rescuing him!<br>  I have heard many stories like yours, and they are very quick to judge whether a dog is "aggressive" or not. I know of a local Jack Russell puppy that was deemed as aggressive, but saved and is not doing good in agility training. Sad, isn't it?|`|26PPwzrWaa	My lab mix is aggressive and if they had kept her longer, they probably would not have adopted her out.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Aggressive dogs are usually destroyed because of the dangers they pose to other humans. However, most dogs are just aggressive because some idiot got a dog and wasn't sure how to treat it and let it run the house, which, in those cases, you can't blame the dog for biting- it is following it's natural behaviors. Anytime I see someone on here asking why their dog starting growling or biting at them, I cringe, because those are the dogs that get put down (or severely hurt someone) because of poor training. Sounds like your dog was one of those cases.<br>  <br>     However, there are some dogs that are not right in the head, and no amount of training will get rid of the aggressiveness- you find that in every species. Those need to be put down because they are unsafe.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I'm glad it worked for you. It doesn't' always end so well though, especially for large dogs. My family got an akita about 6 months ago as a re-home and we have had to schedule him for euthanasia. He has bitten both me and my dad in the time we've had him, growled over food and gotten in several serious fights with my other dog. All of his problems stem from being kept on a chain with little to no human interaction for most of his life. I would love to try and "fix" him, but I can't justify the risk to myself, my family, my other dogs and the general public. Rescues don't want to take the risk of being sued or face being known as a rescue/shelter that adopts out dangerous dogs. If Cooper had gone to a shelter first (which we thought he had, but that's another long story) he quite probably would never have been adopted out.

dE5fs9yzaa	As a person who has worked retail and had to manage stores, I'm glad you complained. Believe me, that's the only way a company will listen, if the customer complains. Upper management would react quicker if a customer complained then they did when a worker did. Don't automatically assume you received a form letter. Just exactly did you want them to say? All they can do at this time is look into it..because how do they know you didn't have it in for someone? Not that you did...just asking you to see their side. I've known companies who would send undercover shoppers in and then completely re-vamp their policies afterwards. You have to give the place a chance. Keep an eye on them and keep complaining! You did a good deed..in fact I'm going to write a store I was in he other day and noticed something not right and I'm going to tell them so!<br>  About the ich...that can be in your water and brought on by stress or a water temp. drop.

Good luck and good job!|`|kAs5o8XDaa	Great you reported them! <br>  I hope they actually do something about it. <br>  If they don't you could try and round up some people who like fish too and start a petition outside the pet store everyday to get the place either closed down or make them have to take care of the fish better. <br>  Maybe just try and make them clean the place up and take care of the fish because with the economy the way it is now, people can't afford to loose their jobs..<br>  You could be saving a lot of fish by doing so. :)<br>  Just a thought.|`|t0K6Haoyaa	well that's your mom's fault, but it doesn't seem like someone actually cared enough to respond. You need to go buy some ich-gone drops to put in your tank as soon as possible.|`|9kceDOTraa	I've got to say that words written are just that, words written and for all you know, they could just can everything after sending it, or they may actually look into it.  Just to make sure they cover their *** I bet this person might place a phone call and get a brief run down of the facts in case you follow up with it and give you a song and dance about what they are going to do in the future, might even offer you something cheap in response, something that won't hit their profit too hard, something like that.<br>  <br>  The Ick thing however, I'd like to point out something.  This could just as easily occur even in more reputable sellers actually.  Ick has the ability to lie dormant in water or fish, and stress can bring this out.  Getting a fish from any seller and not getting Ick doesn't actually mean they didn't have it.  It might be a case they did bring it in, but the water conditions in your tank being good would prevent the outbreak.  Stress is a big factor when it comes to Ick, and the movement of fish from tank to tank does induce some levels of stress on a fish.  Just keep that in mind if you base your argument against this company alone on just the Ick.  Not downing you either, trying to help you cover all angles.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	That's great about their response, and I'm so sorry about your tanks. <br>  I have yet to hear back about my letter.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	That is just your standard reply.

b47e03156d29eac3180178e3596a4f52aa	Assuming you've already got bacteria seeded in your filter from the existing tank (to help prevent a new cycle from occurring), then proper acclimation of your fish should be all you need to do.  <br>  <br>  Everyone does it a little different, but here's what I do just to be safe - float the bag for 15 minutes, then every 5 minutes over the course of another 15 minutes slowly add half a cup of water into the bag before finally releasing the fish into the tank; so the whole process should take 30 minutes.  That should acclimate the fish properly (first 15 minutes for temperature, the next 15 minutes for gradual adjustment to pH and gH).  <br>  <br>  If you're REALLY wanting to be thorough, and I've never gone to the trouble of it - you can do "the drip method."  That's all over the internet so you can check it out, but it basically involves putting your fish in a bucket with your own water and slowly trickling the new water into the bucket through a siphon hose.  My understanding is that discus breeders usually do that for pricy, more-sensitive fish.<br>  <br>  Finally, depending on how expensive your fish are or how attached to them you are, you can trade them or donate them to a fish store and just re-stock when you get to your new town.  Depending on how much you're investing in the time and trouble of moving your entire system and worrying that your fish may not adjust to extreme chemistry changes, that might be easier and more economical for you in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  :)|`|mOayTJDmaa	Take some of the current water you have with you to school.  Start with 75% old water and 25% new.  Do water changes weekly. <br>  What kind of fish?|`|dFBccLExaa	I moved from Ohio to Nevada with three fish. Basically, what I did was I poured some of the water from the est. aquarium into a gallon "travel" aquarium that I had bought (petsmart has these). I put the fish in, and made sure the water was quite cool before going anywhere. Kept them in a place that was secure so that they didn't slosh around, and they made it just fine. For over night, I had a little mini filter from a 2.5 gal tank, and I placed that into the tank each night to reoxygenate the air. They survived for over a week that way while I made it across the country and moved into an apt. So your fish should be fine. Just be sure that you don't feed them too much. That helps.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Start buying RO water now, and use it for your water changes. Gradually, your tank will become mostly RO water. When you get to college, start them off with RO water, and use the tap water there for water changes, to gradually acclimate them.

Good luck!|`|juXYxusWaa	take a a lot of water with you and a lot of food|`|t0K6Haoyaa	ok what you need to do is transfer your fish in the original water there.

I am his primary care giver, though. <br>  <br>  If you get her spayed, she might stop. I highly recommend you getting her spayed, and the sooner, the better. It is even more important for a female to be spayed than a male to be neutered since females are more prone to getting cancer than males.

No, because there big animals and aren't gonna break if you brush their face roughly to get mud off them.<br>  7) If your riding, it keeps them from getting saddle sores.

Usually on the outside walls, but I've known people to put it on the bottoms for moisture too.<br>  4) yes<br>  5) I always thougth the dandy ones were the soft brushes, which can go anywhere.  The hard curry combs aren't as appropriate for the horse's face or legs, since they're bonier.<br>  6) Horses are pretty big - they're not going to break.  I'd say that's a weird question.  You don't want to poke him in the eye or anything, but you don't need to freak out about being gentle with his head.<br>  7) to make sure there isn't any dirt under the saddle, which would cause rubs, and it's also good because you can discover cuts and scrapes and bumps and things as you go over the horse that you didn't notice.|`|pipNCxybaa	1.

It gets the dirt off which keeps their coat heathy and smooth under the saddle, and it stimulates the skin to promote good blood flow.|`|gwLg4a5Taa	1) I would say to use a hoof pick and then use a brush to get the dust and extra dirt.<br>  <br>  2) You can use anything you desire to clean bruses.

I use hoof oil on my mares hoofs becuase she has cracks and i use it from the coronet band all the way down to the ground on the outside.<br>  <br>  4) Its like sanding wood. Go with the coat.<br>  <br>  5) If your brush is hard, dont use it on the face. If its softer you can use it anywheres.<br>  <br>  6) Yes be as gentle as possible. You dont want someone rough housing with your face lol.<br>  <br>  7) You groom them to keep them clean. Just like you take a shower, they need baths and grooming.

vIYGV1C7aa	If you have help, I would have them meet at a neutral location.  This may sound weird, but introduce the puppy butt first, that way, the older dogs get to sniff first and put them in a more dominate role.  Trust me, I just did this last Saturday with my 3 year old and 8 week old GSDs.  It works wonders!<br>  <br>  Edit: Katie S. is correct.  Make sure you give more attention/affection to the older dogs at first as well.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would leave the 6 yr old at home and introduce them there. Some people say to introduce them on neutral ground but I always introduce my new ones at my house and never have a problem.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you need to bring your dog with you so that they can get to know each other.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Personally, I would have introduced the dogs prior to bringing the new puppy home.  Since you're getting him today though, I think a toddler, a large dog and a puppy would be a bit too much to handle on your own.  Introduce the new pup to the older dog once you get home.  Make sure you do it appropriately though (keep both dogs on a leash) and keep the baby out of the way just in case.  You'd hate for your baby to accidentally get hurt in the process of the dogs meeting each other.|`|asp4DaiHaa	leave the dog @ home. the pup will already be scared with the 19 mth old and the ride home etc so its best to leave your older dog @ home. and introduce them by putting them in seperate rooms. rub the pup with a rag and bring it to the older dog in the other room, let him sniff it etc then once the older dog gets used to the pup then bring the pup into the same room and just let them roam as they please|`|knFrwCxcaa	don't let them meet in the house because that's the labs territory let them meet outside and then bring them in the house together <br>  <br>  TIP: don't give more attention to the puppy because the lab will fell left out and he will start to try and fight the pup|`|N81k3yu2aa	good thing i saw this..

gEkLQWF4aa	Switching dog foods on your dog gives them digestion problems. You need to stick with the same food. he isn't getting bored, you're just feeding him too much. If he isn't gobbling down the food when you give it to him he's not hungry and is being over fed. Check the bag of dog food. They will tell you how much you should feed your dog for his weight and age on a daily basis. Please don't keep switching the dog food on him. He'll become overweight and will have diarrhea on a constant basis. He will not be a happy dog.|`|AA11457471	Sure, but do any changes very slowly. Add the new food a little at a time.<br>  You can also add some broth, a dab of canned or a dollop of plain yogurt if you want to make it more interesting.<br>  You've chosen excellent foods!|`|BMIW36XFaa	Stick with one dog food.  If you do change dog food...you feel your dog doesn't like the food he's eating now, buy a new brand and gradually introduce the new brand into the old brand, transitioning over time to the new dog food.<br>  <br>  I was having trouble with my dog eating, too.  I switched to Beneful and she thinks she's getting a treat all the time.<br>  <br>  I also leave my dog's food out all the time, and I've done this since she was a puppy.  That way she only eats when she's hungry and not a schedule based on me.  I realize that some dogs will eat themselves sick that way, but it has always worked well with mine from puppy stage.|`|OxFsslN8aa	My parents had a dog for 18 years and they did just as you are suggesting but they also gave him chocolate & tons of other things that dogs "aren't suppose to have".  I don't know why their dog lived a long healthy life this way and other dogs do not.  I believe it is a matter of genetics - what will react with your dog and what won't.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You can try it and see how it goes with the digestion. You can make it a little different by adding some vegetables or some canned food.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	Changing dog food like that can upset your dogs stomach. How is the dog getting bored with the food?<br>  <br>  Edit...Nevermind. Ashton gave a excellent answer.|`|eidGiG3Kaa	I beg to differ with what most of you are saying.<br>  <br>  Vicotria Stilwell, the author of the book It’s Me or the Dog (the same lady who has the It’s Me or the Dog T.V. show on Animal Planet) say’s “ If you consign a dog to a monotonous diet, you are depriving him of sensory exploration and pleasure.” Yes, you can feed your dog the same dog food every day of his life and he will eat it but that doesn’t mean he enjoys it. I cant imagine living my whole life eating the same meal everyday. HOW BORING! Dogs are the same way.   <br>  <br>  As far as the dogs getting an upset stomach, of course they will. If a dog who has been eating the same dog food for the past three years is all of a sudden switched to a different brand it is going to take his body a little while to adjust to it. The same as if I ate grilled chicken and a baked potato for every meal of the day for the past three years and all of a sudden switched to steak and asparagus. I know for damn well my stomach and digestive system would be all out of wack. So, in the beginning your dog might have loose stools if you introduce him a food he has never had before but after a few days it should go away. I know someone else already mentioned adding broth or yogurt to the dogs food but you could even go further then that. Victoria Stilwell, also says that along with a high quality dog food she feeds her foster dogs cooked chicken, beef, liver, pasta, rice, potatoes, and cooked vegetables. Can you imagine how happy your dog would be if you added a little grilled chicken to his dry dog food dinner once in a while! <br>  <br>  Remember to watch your dogs weight though so you don’t start over feeding him on accident.|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	I wouldn't suggest giving your dog two different types of food each day. Try changing only once a week so his digestive tract doesn't get all screwed up. I change my puppies food every one or two weeks so he gets what he needs and a little variety.<br>  <br>  I don't really think dogs can actually get bored with their food. Food is food to them it's a survival instinct to eat. That's why if you give a dog an entire bag of food he'll keep eating even after he's full. He thinks he needs to eat all the food he can because he doesn't know when he'll get his next meal even if he's been your pet since he was a puppy.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	I would try to try a different food that he does not get bored with, it may upset his stomach to switch food like that all the time. dogs can pick at there food if they do not like it..

cY8DgJv5aa	First of all, get the carpets thoroughly cleaned.  For as long as he continues to smell the feces, he'll always return there to relieve himself.<br>  <br>  Second of all, make sure you are limiting his food.  If you have a food bowl out for him to eat from whenever he'd like, then of course he's going to also poop whenever he likes.  If you are feeding him at scheduled times each day, you'll be able to better predict when he needs to go.  After completely relieving himself outside about 30 minutes after eating (he may need to poop several times rather than just once), he shouldn't need to poop again until after his next meal.<br>  <br>  Also, since this is the only room with carpet and seems to be where he prefers to poop, then simply don't allow him in that room.  Use gates to block it off.<br>  <br>  If you've already done all of those things, then I would suggest speaking with a professional trainer.|`|lKVORFx7aa	after he eats about 20 mins to an hour after he eats take him out side and when be dose go potty prays him a-lot|`|KxjUim7yaa	If you don't want to keep him in his crate he may never get house trained. You need to take him out and have him go. then play with him outside for 15 more minutes until he finishes the pooing. Don't let him near the rugs or furniture. Keep him in a easily cleanable area. Use Nature's Miracle for any accident spots.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Why on earth do you have a dog if he is locked in a cage all day? Please read my article on house training. If you work all day and you don't want the dog outside the whole day, install a doggy door and teach him how to use it. At the moment "outside" for him means outside his cage.

8OJZYB3Taa	I agree with you, defiantly dont think they can fix a problem but can defiantly help. I use a german martingale on my mare who is realy High headed. and i use a running martingale on my gelding and sometimes on my mare.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Actually they are BOTH referred to as martingales.  The "Tie down" is referred to as a STANDING Martingale and as you know attaches either to the cavesson of an English bridle or a pencil bosal or noseband of a western bridle.  Both prevent the horse's head from raisin beyond a certain point and causing problems.<br>  <br>  I had an AQHA mare in 1970, who once I put one on her, went like a dream.<br>  <br>  A RUNNING martingale uses the horse's mouth to keep the head down by pulling it closer to the horse's neck.<br>  <br>  I use this martingale when training green horses on how to learn to flex and round off, but use it sparingly.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	What do you mean you can't fix a high headed horse? Through good riding, soft hands, and consistent training you can fix anything. Some horses have conformation that places their heads higher than normal, but that still isn't an excuse to slap a tie down on just because you don't have the patience or the ability to train your horse correctly.|`|5TCewPYRaa	They are an half-as*ed fix to a major training problem...people who use these are lazy and need to learn that riding a horse means that you may actually have to RIDE the animal, not sit there and worry about whether your hair looks nice...|`|XbQGyiT7aa	i personally don't use them. i had a high-headed horse that was fast but kind of spooky. forcing his head down would have messed him up, i feel. before it was just because i felt i didn't have enough knowledge to use them properly. but i've never been a fan of extra equipment. i like the horse to do it on his own, not because there's something holding him down. plus, i feel like both myself and my horse would become dependent on it. but that's just me. in short, i feel that if someone knows how to use it properly, then it can really help. but used in the wrong way, it can set you back more steps than you came. <br>  <br>  and when i first read your question, i thought you were saying a high-headed horse couldn't be fixed. but when i read it over again, i realized what you were saying. i agree and disagree. i agree when you say that tie-downs and martingales can't fix a horse. i disagree when you say that they are temporary fixes. these pieces of equipment are meant as training aids, not band-aids. if they were used right and with success, when they come off, the horse's head shouldn't return to it's former position.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	They are good tools to use while training. But they are just a crutch. Some classes at show will not let you use them so then everything you depend on them to do has just vanished.<br>  <br>  I had a saddlebred who for obvious reasons had a high head carriage i used to martingale on him training if I wasn't necessarily focusing on his body and more focusing on jumps for instance. <br>  <br>  So to work on a his high head carriage I lounged him with a surcingle. Worked wonders, the worst part of his head carriage is during dressage its great for a horse to keep his/her frame, (nice and round.) Ben on the other hand would through his head up during transitions. So lounging him with the surcingle helped out so much!|`|SzW9GmRsaa	So what's the point of a temporary fix?  Why not school these problems out of your horse?<br>  <br>  Too many people think martingales will sort their horses out.  Many other people think their horse needs a martingale when it throws its head in the air in reaction to hard hands or a heavy seat.  Tons of horses throw their heads to balance during an upwards transition and that too is called disobedient and a problem.<br>  <br>  Do not say it cannot be fixed because it can - you just need to be able to fix it, and if you can't yourself you need to get hold of a decent instructor to teach you!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	I think they're a useful tool.  Since they're not attached to the bit, it makes them ideal for beginners, since the martingale prevents their heads from going sky high without having to rip the horse's face off, saves the horse from clumsy beginner hands in that sense.  It's a good, mild tool.  I know a lot of school ponies who know every trick in the book, and martingales can help.<br>  <br>  They obviously need to be fitted properly|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Unless your horse's neck is so ewed that it's bordering on a deformity, I do believe that high heads can be fixed.  You need to figure out why it's high in the first place.  Is it becuse the rider has heavy hands?  Does the horse have back, neck or poll pain?  Maybe it's due to poor or insufficient training?  Is the bit too severe or does it not fit correctly?  Do the horse's teeth have problems?  It could be any one of these things or more.  Once you know why the horse is carrying its head so high, you can determine what the solution is.   I'd much rather get to the root of a problem in the hopes of fixing it than just putting a band aid on it.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	I NEVER use them. A saddle and bridle and nothing else. Its not fair on the horse to tie it up so it cant put its head up or down. If the horse rears its because of something you are doing and you shouldn't be riding that horse or you should learn to understand the horse. Sorry but thats my view.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	you can fix a high headed horse. BUT it takes time and patience. you need to have flexion. its all in the HANDS....i think they are useless....|`|pipNCxybaa	I think you shouldnt use them unless they the horse was REALLY high headed.<br>  <br>  If its just in case they do or they hardly do i think you shouldnt|`|BiUNuyfFaa	It's all in the training. My horse used to have a high head but I fixed. You don't use a martingale for high headed horses. You shouldn't be using one if you don't know what it's for. A standing martingale is  usually used on horses who throw their heads while jumping. A running is to help slow down jumpers. As for keeping heads down I would recommend training with draw reins when you hack.|`|RbezhoN1aa	I Personally HATE Them!!!!!!!!!!! I Think They Are Dangerous Incase Your Horse Were To Trip The Tie Down or Martingale Would Make It Hard To Regain Balence.<br>  <br>  Trust Me My Trainer Wont Let Me To Use Either And My Horse Can Be High Headed, Just Incase Her Were To Trip.<br>  <br>  Actually A Quick Fix To A High Headed Horse Is To Massage The Reins, Thats What My Trainer Makes All Of Use To. It Really Does Work|`|Caj2XcqPaa	i have been riding for about 9 years now and i really don't like either they make me nervous i have had a horse flip over while i was using one and sense then i don't use either|`|RZPLec5Eaa	see arr harr  could not have said it better!<br>  <br>  Work through the problems, don't use something that makes them. YOU make them.|`|OJIXRFxMaa	Personally, I don't mind them. They are there to help control the horse. I ride a what, 17hh TB for my lessons, who is high headed, but we found out he's doing that to avoid the bit. Mind you that he is comfortable in every way possible, he has his feet checked, his saddle fits properly, his  teeth and back are good. he's still young, but he's not supposed to be avoiding the bit, so the martingale just helps him to not be able to throw his head up and avoid it.<br>  <br>  I think that they shouldn't be used all the time, but I see nothing wrong with them.

Get the flour off it. You can put some vazaline on it to sort of put a seal on it.|`|rUjUmXNjaa	if the toenail is cut too short, you can use a styptic pencil containing silver nitrate to stop blood flow, although many animals object to the styptic pencil as much, or more, than toenail cutting. The black end of the stick is held to the bleeding nail and gently rotated until bleeding stops.<br>  <br>  Even without any treatment the nail should stop bleeding in about 5 minutes or less.<br>  <br>  or you can also use these<br>  styptik powder, spend maybe $6 dollars <br>  <br>  corn starch|`|qrGLcTh4aa	you don't say what type of dog, I'm going to assume he is rather large and shouldn't bleed to death from a nail.  If it continues to bleed you may want to wrap the paw with gauze and tape and it should be ok tomorrow.  You should always have quik-stop on hand if you are going to do dogs nails at home.  It is a product that stops the bleeding and eases the pain.  Don't be surprised if the dog doesn't let you do his nails again.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Pack more flour on it and apply pressure. You shouldn't be cutting your dog's nails at home if you don't have kwick stop. It works better than flour. If you cut to far and it continues to bleed, you may have to take him to the vet so they can chemically cauterize it with Silver nitrate.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	That's because flour doesn't work.  Use cornstarch.  Or powdered coffee creamer as it's high in cornstarch if you don't have cornstarch.  You don't need kwik stop or whatever.  Cornstarch or coffee creamer is just fine.  Put a little on your finger, and plug the nail for a second or two, and voila, no more bleeding.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	Whenever trimming your dog's nails, you should always have some styptic powder on hand (Kwik Stop is a popular brand).  A little jar will last you many years.  Failing that, some use corn starch with success.  I don't think flour is sufficient to help clot.  Good luck!|`|H7BHurpiaa	if you can go to the store go to the pet section and see if there is quick stop its a powder that stop the bleeding<br>  if not try a potatoe the startch may stop it and try to apply pressure to get it to stop <br>  I hope it stops soon!|`|TBfFbbvtaa	Flour works but you have to pack it.

nFcl0BOsaa	A lot depends on how much your puppy sleeps. Many of them sleep a lot for the first few weeks. But you will probably need to set a clock to get up at least once during the night to take him out to potty.  The only way I know to "get" a puppy to wake up later than he usually would is to try to keep him awake longer. So either way, you're going to have to sacrifice some of your sleep time. You're getting a baby dog, that's the way it is.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	It depends at what time he goes to sleep.<br>  I have a 10 week old puppy and as of now he sleeps about 5-6 hours (sometimes less) and then he needs to go to the bathroom. I take him out and he usually goes right back to sleep for another 2-3 hours. If you want your dog to sleep till later, put him to bed later. But be prepared to take him out at night. Puppies can't hold it too long.<br>  Good luck with your new puppy!! :o)|`|wuQCq0e8aa	HaRd To KnOw FoR sUrE.<br>  <br>  dont wake them up too early, they need rest!!<br>  <br>  puppies are so cute cuz they have puppy breath!|`|UETAqR8Taa	it varies, sometimes they can be up at the crack of dawn or other times they like to just stay in bed with you until you get up.

twtWD7glaa	Well first of all, rats should never be housed alone unless very aggressive. You'll need a same sex buddy for it or it will get lonely and depressed. <br>  Do some extra chores around the house, help out with the dog and the fish, etc. Just try being really good and don't ask too much. Maybe bring them to a pet store and play with some rats there with them so show them how sweet they can be.<br>  Good luck.|`|OrvTG44laa	Just counter the reasons she gives you.  For example, she said your dog might eat it.  That's not very likely.  While most dogs would try to kill a rat if they saw one, the rat can be kept safe by having a secure cage, placing the cage on a shelf where the dog can not reach it, and keeping the door closed to the room that the rat is in so the dog can't get to it.|`|JNnSMh64aa	Do lots of research, because I can tell you haven't. Become knowledgeable in rats and impress your parents with how much you know about them. If you are not willing to do that, I don't think you're ready for that kind of responsibility.|`|DqEyrDYhaa	you seem like you are too young and immature to proeperly care for rats.

Your dog just wants to be close and is a bit insecure.  Dogs work co-operatively in a pack.  They need leadership but dominance is not the way to work with any animal.  Anyone who has actually worked with wild animals (like me) knows this.  Every member has a role and is expected to live up to it.  Spending as much time fighting for dominance as people like CM think happens would be a massive waste of time and energy within a pack trying to survive.|`|bIaywrBCaa	they just want to be near us.<br>  <br>  I rode home in the backseat of my car yesterday with a 2 month old baby goat in my lap, well almost.........He is just a big baby!

If you cannot remove your dog from you at any given time and he does not allow you to do that and/or insists on claiming your lap as his own without regard to what you want him to do it is dominance.<br>  <br>  THAT is what Mr. Millan teaches.<br>  <br>  If I do not want my dogs on my lap, I remove them.

3n60UxgQaa	I certainly hope you're not feeding him 5 pellets an hour.<br>  <br>  Let's address the issues one by one. =]<br>  <br>  1.  Most fish will always eat non stop if given the chance.  Call this instinct if you will.  In the wild, fish are not guaranteed the next meal at a certain time so they will eat as much as they can when food is available so it lasts until the next time they eat.  Don't feed him that much.  Feed at max 6 pellets a day.  I feed mine 3-4 a day and I try to spread them out.  One in the morning, afternoon, and evening and maybe a snack in between.  <br>  <br>  2.  I don't really see why his tank would be cleaner if you feed him more.  Perhaps I overlooked something?  Do you have a filter?  Not the regular kinds as bettas don't like a lot of current.  Maybe you should invest in a sponge filter. =] They're not very powerful but do a relatively good job of maintaining the water quality.<br>  <br>  3.  Don't feed him so much bloodworms.  No more than 3 a week.  While bettas are carnivores and bloodworms are good for them, too much can be a bad thing.  Bloodworms are very high in protein and too much can have a reverse effect.<br>  <br>  4.  The temperature sounds good. =]  If it's 80F without a heater, than the heater isn't really necessary.<br>  <br>  5.  Two out of three of my bettas jump at the food as well.  I think it's fairly normal. =]  Sometimes, I'll even hold the food above the water and they'll jump and snatch it out of my hand. =]<br>  <br>  6.  Perhaps he's seeing himself (a reflection in the glass?).  If space permits, get some plants to block the section he does that in. =]|`|Ywr05G7Laa	ok what maybe is happening is that your fish could most likely be pregnant go check at a pet store good luck

jV7SmnaTaa	There are many pieces to this problem. First - teh crouching down and urinating is a submissive urination. There isn't a whole lot you can do about that - you just have to build his confidence and introduce him to lots of people.<br>  <br>  Next - is he neutered? Un-neutered dogs around 6-7 months of age go through puberty and begin to behave like real male dogs. Part of this includes urine marking - so, they will urinate on all sorts of things. Best cure is to neuter ASAP before the problem is harder to fix.<br>  <br>  Next - you should have him checked (bring in a urine sample) for a UTI. This is very common in dogs and can be the reason why they urinate in the house. Countless dogs and cats are euthanized and abandoned every year simply because they have a basic medical condition and are not treated.<br>  <br>  Finally - TRAINING! First - invest in a crate. One that's not too big, but not too small. The dog should be able to stand up, sit up, and turn around. However, they can't have tons of room to play or it won't work. The idea of a crate is that a dog isn't going to urinate/defecate where they cant' escape the smell and would be forced to lay in it. This is essential! Also, when you have the dog out of the crate - put on his leash and tie it to your belt loop while you do your daily activities. This allows you to watch the dog and assist it with potty training. The dog should be brought outside atleast every hour during day time hours until it gets the hang of things - and when it goes potty outside...PRAISE!!<br>  <br>  Final advice...a tired dog is a good dog. Get the dog out and get it some exercise! Tired dogs don't chew, have less anxiety, and potty in the house less.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|SLL8jT4faa	Crate train the dog.  Treats when they do good.  Back in the crate when they don't pee/poop outside.  Eventually when you let them out they will HAVE to go.  It takes time and patience but it WORKS. =)|`|pOmjcVjZaa	My dog had that same problem.<br>  The second the puppy pees in the house, dont punish him!<br>  Take him directly outside, to show him that he has to go outside to go pee.<br>  And since he's a puppy, try to take him outside a lot more than you would an older dog.<br>  Also, when the dog does pee outside, reward him, give him a treat.|`|mDeyha01aa	well i know someone who used this technique for barking but you might as well try it...get an empty soup can and fill it with coins or rocks, and whenever he pees shake it really loud so it sort of startles the dog, obviously you have to be there when its peeing, but keep doing it until the dog learns...hope it works|`|Nm2psEJ3aa	i just baught the dog diaper thingies and every time she started peeing i just carried her to the diaper  and eventually she got used to using the diaper|`|dnGtF12taa	Well at night you can start be crating him/her. Just take them out every 2 hours and always reward them when they go.
x8Vgu6acaa	A reputable breeder usually does not breed those 10 females.  Some will be too young to breed and are working on their championships.  and growing out until they are 2 years old and can be tested.  Some of those may fail and not be bred at all.  Usually a good breeder will retire a female at 5 or 6 years of age.  And will not breed every heat.  So at most usually they will only get 3 maybe 4 litters if that many from each female before they are retired.  Many breeders breed even less.  So some of those 10 females are retired and having no more puppies.  So considering, this breeder has 10 females.  and the breed lives to 15 years old.  <br>  1-2 dogs will be too young<br>  3-4  dogs will be breeding age<br>  4-6 dogs will be retired. <br>  <br>  Plus it is very expensive to breed good quality dogs.  See some of the other posts to get an idea of the costs.|`|PM23RDycaa	Reputable breeders don't even come close to selling that many animals a year.|`|bIaywrBCaa	If thery are not breeding purebred animals but the designer breeds, they are a puppy mill or at best BYB's. If they have champions and selling dogs from champion lines they may be able to sell the pups, if not, probably not that many. Reputable breeders are lucky to break even. No matter how many dogs they sell.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	There isn't a huge number of reputable breeders with that many dogs. Usually people who breed so many puppies are well known among others involved with the particular breed and will get referrals from all over the country, and often even from foreign countries. Despite the fact that they sell so many puppies, these breeders aren't making much profit, if any. Breeding dogs is just a hobby for them; their actual income comes from their day job.<br>  <br>  edit: There are also lots of breeders that don't actually keep all the dogs on their own property. It's common for a breeder to co-own a dog that they can use for breeding, but that is kept by the other co-owner. <br>  <br>  There are also some breeders who have partners, so that they both use the same kennel name and share the same dogs, but often live in different cities.|`|NbvTyN7saa	They have a farm, staff usually and spend their lives dedicated to their animals so that they build a reputation that people will go to them for dogs.  <br>  <br>  Few breeders make a lot of money.  It is a 24/7 job and you have to love, Love, LOVE what you do to make it worth while.|`|gjD8pndjaa	What you've described (80 dogs a year) is a puppy mill.<br>  <br>  Good breeders simply don't make money.

U4cYbkNQaa	The warts wont hurt her. Don't put her on meds for this. She is old and needs loving care at this point, not to be poked and pulled on.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	find another vet.  it is very common for dogs to develop cysts, lipomas, and warts as they get older.  especially terrier breeds.|`|fXoutyPmaa	Hello!<br>  Yeah, Ive heard of it. My dog used to have them before he died( those were not the causes btw. He broke his hip and he went downhill really fast after that so we had to put him down). <br>  Don't worry about the warts as they don't affect your dogs health. Just give your dog lots of love!|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Try taking her to another vet to see if you get different results.
6yoCcGBWaa	You can really only judge by their size and gender markings. They grow to about an 1" within the first year.  So if your dp is already that big, you can't say for sure how much over a year they are.
9kceDOTraa	Not really no, in addition to the more detailed information your better answer gave you, as well you must consider sheer size too.  While some keepers can get either Africans to adapt to SA conditions or vice versa, which is not an easy thing to overcome, the size most SA's and CA's get to be is much too large to house Africans with them.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	nope.|`|0wTCIlYcaa	not really.  american cichlids require acidic, very soft water, while african cichlids have more basic, hard water.
wv6LHgQpaa	What it says to me is that she is not getting enough exercise so therefore she is bored.  Like a child if they are not wore out they will find other, sometimes not so nice forms of entertainment.  I have 2 chows that are in the house all day and I work 12 hrs a day.  I make sure to take them both for a bike ride/run every morning for at least 30 mins then again in the evenings, they are much calmer and appreciate laying around all day.    If you don't have time to do it in the mornings get her used to a treadmill.  If you show dogs then you should know that when a dog is calm they act better therefore exercise them. (running around in a yard does not count as exercise)<br>  Also, your male is acting dominant now towards you since you do not have control of her, he probably no longer sees you as the leader but will begin to see her as the one running the house.    Good luck.|`|u1UeQz6paa	The store or where ever you got her might not have treated her right, maybe you should do some research on that store or where ever you got her, I hope you find out whats wrong feel better. Sorry!|`|TBd9CeYeaa	it happens <br>  <br>  that means she need heavy training and you need to start her on it now and buy her lots of toys so she has something to play with<br>  or your house will become her play toy|`|jHSyRa0taa	I show dogs as well.  I grew up with Dobbies.  As much as it was hard for me to do...you must crate her when you leave.  She will chill after about 6 months to a year.  I would plan the meals around your schedule.  It is fine to feed one time per day and actually best.  If you leave really early feed them when you get home.  If the opposite feed them in the morning, so she won't have her legs crossed when you get home.  The thing about your male...let him know you are the pack leader and his behavior is unacceptable.  You could put him in time out, but I find a fly swatter does the trick.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Your dog is bored, Dobermans need mental stimulation-Take her on 4km daily walks & play with her.<br>  <br>  She needs trainning & exercise.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Like many undesirable canine behaviors, destructive habits usually develop because a dog is bored, lonely, or both. It's not fair or realistic to expect your dog--especially a working breed --to spend long hours quietly sitting and waiting for your return. By nature dogs are curious and sentient beings; see that she has enough mental and physical stimulation to minimize the impulse to dig and chew.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that can help you with more information about treating this unlikely behavior:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/chewing-digging-behavior.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/chewing-digging-behav...</a>|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Yes, the male dog is showing his dominance because he "owns this house" He was there before and he wants to show that he is next on the hierarchy.  As far as chewing, a one year old will chew and chew and chew!! What you need to do is exercise her until she feels like dropping out from being tired. Get a treadmill.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Have you ever thought of crate training? It would stop her from destroying the house while you are not home.|`|Hjny2ducaa	I would get a new trainer that specializes in this behavior|`|wTvlreI7aa	Make sure  they know you are the dominant one. And three words for ya. Chew Toy Training! I chew toy trained my rottweiler puppy. it works wonders! Make sure you get a large raw hide bone and always have 2 or 3 different kinds on the floor at all times, so when she gets that crave to chew, she will grab a raw hide instead of the couch or shoes.  All you do is, when you catch her chewing on something she isn't supposed to. Give her a smack on the nose and push her away from what she was chewing, then grab one of hher toys and give it to her to chew. when she starts chewing on it, tell her good girl and pet her calmly praisng her. Eventually she will see this toy or raw hide is the chew toy and you will be able to leave your shoes in the middle of the floor and she wont touch them. I've been chew toy training my rotie pup since he was 8 weeks and he is now 13 1/2 weeks and he rarely ever touches the shoes. I can leave the show closet open and he sees it as no reason to go on there.   :) give it a try. You will have to constantly watch her untill you trust her more.
n4pNNcGfaa	Some are and some aren't.  It depends on how they are bred, raised and handled.  Pitbulls do have a bad reputation.  You can improve your own dog's personal reputation by helping him earn a Canine Good Citizen certificate from the American Kennel Club and have him registered with a program so he can do volunteer pet therapy work.|`|Qta1HgWCaa	Personally, I don't think so. It's all how you train them and how they are raised. I have a rescued 3yr old female pit bull who gets along perfectly with my 2lb female chihuahua as well as many other small/toy dogs. She also will play nicely and cuddle with my 20month old daughter. It's all the environment which they are raised in.<br>  <br>  But  I agree with the other post about taking the canine good citizen course, it's a great way to build trust with you and your dog, as well as show others your dog's gentle personality, abilities and skills.
9kceDOTraa	You cannot tell visually.  Oscars are a monomorphic species, and short of venting them or watching them go through a test of power, you can't tell.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	There is no physical feature that explains the sex of the fish, really the only way you can tell is if your Oscars start to mate, even then it's hard to tell which one is which.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!~~~~|`|6rRVLHonaa	It has been said and written that a female oscar can have a more fuller body and more brighter red colouring but that is not always the case.

8owlj2xHaa	You can NOT say that you do not need an rodi unit for a saltwater tank !!!<br>  Everyones tap water is different and or dirtier. Here in philly my TDS or number of pollutants is only 180 ppm, not bad, but still not low enough for a fish tank. In Arizona their TDS is 800ppm >  I would love to see you try to do a saltwater tank with that water. The best place to get RODI water is from a machine at most supermarkets and walmarts. Most Fish store RODI water is usually questionable in its quality. They do not change their filters when needed resulting in bad water quality. here is a link to an inexpensive home unit. <br>  <a href="http://www.airwaterice.com/product/1MMDI/Mighty_Mite_50GPD_with_DI_Added.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.airwaterice.com/product/1MMDI...</a>|`|I4BimUCwaa	I don't know anywhere you can buy RO water but I know this website sells RO filtration systems and they ship anywhere ...

HJa7cVFMaa	Yes you are right; the Syrian hamsters are sometimes called the Panda bear,  Black bear, and Teddy bear<br>  Hamsters don’t throw up; they don’t have the ability to do that. But what it may be is food. I have seen on occasions where  Syrians may sometimes put food in the wee corner, as well as under the water bottle, particularly the pelleted food that they don’t eat. After a while this soaks up the urine and swells up, it does sometimes look like throw up.<br>  <br>  Hamster Breeder
uQVjAqk4aa	Ive spent alot of time looking into this. and to be honest you'll be hard pressed to find an accurate site. theres lots of sites out there, but most are biased or use a flat grading scale that doesn't actually work for different food types. in my personal experiences i have found both Natural Balance and Nutro to be pretty decent. Ultra's Holistic line also impressed me but its sold in small quantities and my dog is a large eater, so i really can't keep up price wise. Natural Balance also has different dog food blends for allergy prone dogs, which is a rare find. their catfood is the same, and i have seen first hand how it helped improve the health of my mothers cat who had become chronically ill. Nutro is made from about the same stuff as natural balance, and i can get it locally (petco is a bit of a drive from here) so i use that one mostly. if money means nothing, look into dog lovers gold, i havn't used it but if i had the money i would probably give it a try.<br>  <br>  when i buy a dog food, i look at the ingredients. its just like feeding kids. the first thing you look for is whether the food is real, or by-product. would you feed your kids hotdogs every day? of course not. you shouldn't feed your dog hot dogs everyday either. look for foods that list grains and grainmeals, like corn meal as the first or second ingredient. dogs don't need cornmeal, its just a filler, so even if its cheaper, your dog isn't getting anything from it. <br>  <br>  the at home test:poop. <br>  you can tell how your dog is processing food by their poo. feeding a dog a junkfood diet like beneful or science diet, you can easily see their poop is very soft. (think of eating a couple sliders from white castle). you should be able to see more of a solid grainy texture in the poo if the food is satisfying the dogs nutritional needs. obviously though, not so solid its problematic. for my dog, i thought the holistic Ulta brand was best for this, but again, a little expensive. she only gets it when i have coupons! haha. <br>  <br>  my opinion: most dog food, is crap. the good to bad ratio is even worse than kids cereals i think. brands that claim to be high quality and above par (like royal canin) usually fall on their face in the ingredients section, and too many dog owners base a "good dog food" on their dogs taste preference, failing to ever ask themselves, which tastes better: cheesecake smothered in strawberry sauce, or brussel sprouts? im always up to give a new food a try, so id never claim to know the "best food", since i would like to think theres endlessly something better around the corner. foods i would never serve my dog(ever and/or again): Iams, science diet, beneful, any of the aforementioned or unincluded also produced by purina. diamond, pretty much anything you'd see in walmart, good life, pedigree etc. im not really that impressed by eukaneuba for all the hype, although its not as bad as the others... i wouldn't mind giving bluebuffalo's lamb and rice a try sometime or mmmmaybe a biljac food just because of their quality meats approach. I have not yet tried either the Caesar Milan or Rachel ray foods, but im not impressed to see the actual chicken in Caesar Milan's food make it barely on the top line at number six in the list of ingredients. rachel ray's nutrish line has some promise, and seems to combine some of the winning approaches that other brands use, and combines them into a single food (like beet pulp and brewers rice). i usually wouldnt expect much from a "celebrity" type sponsor, but after looking it over im a little interested to give a real try. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped a little, and congrats on your new job.|`|S40zeZ7Waa	i depends on the dog is he/she lazy, playful,ect.<br>  wat he likes and will eat and what he/she needs|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Mother Nature's unbranded feeding methods aka whole prey model, raw feeding, raw meaty bones, 'frankenprey' or species appropriate feeding.  <br>  <br>  I do buy 'Roo Chunks' at my local petshop - does this count?<br>  <br>  I don't see how any processed, commercial foods could be considered 'best' as they are full of inappropriate ingredients, preservatives, cooked proteins etc.  ** even the 'grain free' products are loaded with high carb vegetables.|`|ARfxEH0qaa	I tried many brands in the market.

AA11002791	If you saw the vomit, did it look like the food you fed her? (Save a sample for the Vet to test)  Or was it just foamy liquid.  It might not necessarily be the food you gave her, unless it happen right after you gave her the food.

jA1nfMeyaa	1)  A well groomed Springer on a good diet will not be an excessive shedder.  A daily brush down is best to maintain coat condition and reduce shedding.  Even when spaniels shed their hair is fine and silky so it doesn't stick to clothes or furniture.  It's always very easy to sweep up as it clumps together on the floor, versus short-haired breeds like Labs or JRTs that have coarse spikey hair that sticks to EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  2)  They're not hyper, but they are energetic breed.  They were originally bred for hunting so I wouldn't expect anything else.  They make excellent jogging companions and are always ready for a run in the fields or swimming.  This is an intelligent and athletic breed that needs both its mind and body stimulated on a daily basis.  A bored Springer ends up being "hyper" and destructive.  A happy and content Springer will play outside with you for hours then settle down in the house.<br>  <br>  3)  Welsh and English Springers are 2 entirely different breeds.

So if he wants to continue to go forward, he has to stop pulling and walk correctly.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	If your sidewalk has those markings that separate each "square", use that as a training tool. Start at one line with your dog with a loose hand, meaning to let the leash fall a little. As soon as your dog starts to pull, stop in your tracks and don't let him go anywhere. Wait about 10 seconds, and continue to walk. Again, once he pulls, stop and wait. It tells him that the only way he's able to get somewhere (his treat) is if he doesn't pull.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out(:<br>  <br>  Edit: George Rose's idea is good as well, because it can work with dogs that have a habit at lunging towards people and/or other dogs on walks.

QpElKY8Kaa	No, you can't.  AQHA won't touch an Appaloosa marked horse.   PtHA, read the rules, won't touch an Appaloosa marked horse.<br>  APHA won't even consider anything outside AQHA, TB or APHA.  Assuming APHA is Paint Association<br>  <br>  If there was any justice in the world, ApHC wouldn't either but they've sold their souls to the devil.<br>  <br>  You have no guarantee the mutt foal will have mottled skin or any markings at all.   As for registry, it'll be neither fish, flesh nor fowl.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	You've had some good replies so I won't waste my time repeating what they said.<br>  But my question for you is - what is your mare exactly. You said she is a registered Quarter horse Appendix/Paint horse. Okay, what is she actually? If she is a registered AQHA appendix, is she also actually registered as a Paint? There are double registered horses out there, so I'm trying to determine if your mare is truly double registered, or just an AQHA with excessive white. This will determine the answer to your question, too.<br>  If your mare is AQHA only, then if you breed her to ApHC you could get a registered ApHC, but not registered AQHA. If the foal has excessive white it may be ineligable for registration. The Paint Horse Association and most Appy associations (there are so many its confusing!) will not register horses that are cross-bred to each other because of the distortion that occurs in their colorations. You will not be able to register with PtHA if they know the foal has Appy bloodlines.<br>  IF the mare is registered APHA and not AQHA, then neither APHA or Appy will register the foal. The PtHA might register the foal if it doesn't have appy type markings.<br>  If you're wanting to have a foal that is in many registries, then try breeding your mare to something like herself. If she is AQHA and bred to a APHA you could get both APHA and Pinto. If she is APHA you could get APHA and Pinto as well, but not AQHA. If you breed her Arab you could get Pinto and Half Arab. If you breed Thoroughbred you could get Paint and Pinto. But stay away frm the Appy cross as neither registrations like the mix.|`|e0d1fd0946635e07415a457b91cc8b6baa	APHA, AQHA,and PtHA would not register the foal, since none of them will register a horse with Appaloosa bloodlines. ApHC may take the foal, since the dam is also considered a quarter horse. I am not sure if they penalize excessive markings or not. But if that happened and they would not register it, then you are left with a grade foal.<br>  <br>  This is a list of breed that Pinto will accept:<br>  <br>  Outcross papers are registration papers from any equine association. PtHA accepts papers from the following approved associations.<br>  <br>  Horse <br>  American Paint Horse <br>  American Quarter Horse <br>  Hanoverian <br>  Holsteiner <br>  Jockey Club (Thoroughbred) <br>  Oldenburg <br>  Trakhener <br>  United States Trotting Association <br>  Westphalian <br>  American Morgan Horse Registry <br>  American Saddlebred Horse Association <br>  American Saddlebred Horse Association of Canada <br>  Arabian Horse Registry <br>  Canadian Arabian Horse Registry <br>  Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association <br>  National Show Horse Registry <br>  Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders and Exhibitors Association of America <br>  International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association|`|oQmL4IdWaa	The resulting foal will possibly be register-able with the PtHA if it has enough Overo characteristics but doesn't have any appaloosa characteristics, but I think they may refuse it if they know it has an appaloosa sire, which would mean you would have to hardship register her as parentage unknown.<br>  <br>  The ApHC will not register any horses whose AQHA parents has the Excessive white statement on their papers.  Below is the rule that ApHC put into place when AQHA lifted the white rule. <br>  <br>  "In an effort to impede excessive white in the Appaloosa breed, the Board passed a motion making all American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA)-registered stallions and mares that have the following or similar notation on their registration papers ineligible as a parent of an Appaloosa: “This horse has white markings designated under AQHA rules as an undesirable trait and uncharacteristic of the breed.”<br>  <br>  If the baby is born without excessive or misplaced white, but Appaloosa characteristics you could potentially  hardship register it with the ApHC they will only hardship spayed mares and geldings, and you would have to lie and say that parentage was unknown.<br>  <br>  AQHA and APHA obviously will not register a horse with an Appaloosa parent, so your only option would be the Pintaloosa registry, and they are kind-of a dime store registry.<br>  <br>  If the baby ended up Palomino, without appaloosa or paint characteristics you could register it with the palomino associations.<br>  <br>  The potential baby that you describe would not be register-able with any of the associations you listed(although if the only appaloosa characteristics are a white sclera and striped hoofs they may be missed as appy characteristics)<br>  <br>  My advice would be to find an AQHA or APHA stallion to breed your mare to.
galoGEOFaa	I say it was fine to tell her that, the fact remains either way that the dog has died and nothing can change that. There's no reason for her to spend the rest of her life beating herself up for something that may not have had anything to do with her at all. And without knowing for sure, its best to just assume old age took it course.<br>  <br>  <br>  That being said, anyplace that would board a dog and claim it died because the owner left it there is most likely unlicensed, and if they are licensed, they need to have it revoked. Most likely they did something that caused the death of the animal and they were trying to hide it by blaming her. Maybe they were partially right though, the dog died because she left it with some seriously unqualified individuals.|`|5yhitoY0aa	I don't know if anyone is in the same situation as I was, but when I rescued my dog, Spike, from a shelter about eight months ago, I was having the worst trouble training him.  Thanks to the care he received from his previous owners, he had a horrible problem with aggressing towards other dogs, going to the bathroom inside of the house, and even keeping us up all night barking.  I wasted months and hundreds of dollars on a local trainer, and also the online course from a famous "tv trainer".  After six months of frustration, I finally found a guide that helped me notice a change in his behaviors in just a few weeks.  I still have a long ways to go with him, but I'm finally seeing major progress.  I put my story online in a blog to hopefully help other people avoid the time, money, and unneeded frustration that I went through.  You can check out my story at:|`|rZSYtcSjaa	I'd say at 16 years old, it's very possible that if this was the only time the woman went away, that maybe he did just starve himself. As unlikely as that is, it doesn't seem entirely out of the realm of possibility to me that the dog would be entirely dependent on the woman feeding him, even to the extent of needing to see her feed him before eating.<br>  <br>  However, at 16 years old, I ask what kind of dog this was, because that could also play a vital role in this whole situation. I had to put my dog down around this time last year. He was a 12 year old Rottweiler who had what the veterinarian thought could be cancer. So really, the size, breed, activity, and diet of the dog are all factors that could have played into his "dying of old age."<br>  <br>  Nothing dies because it is old. Things die when the accumulation of the bad in life catches up with it.|`|K2dNndE2aa	it's fine...my dog died when she was 16...most don't live past that anyway...some live to be 20 but that's extremely rare, most dogs are lucky to live til they're 16 so that was fine to say.<br>  <br>  sure she had other things wrong with her, but it all happened BECAUSE she was old (arthritis and stuff)

ydshiNrKaa	Ok, I read some of the other answers, and I have to say, this is not "cute" but just bad behavior.  The dog has no manners and you need to teach her that she can't be jumping around from chair to chair, on the tables, etc.  Would you allow a 60 or 70 pound puppy to do this? I don't think so, so why let her do it.  Start training her that she can only be on the furniture when you allow her on the furniture.  A well mannered puppy is a happier one.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Dogs like to climb and jump, too. <br>  <br>  Try putting double-sided sticky tape on the back of the chairs. Most dogs dislike the sensation of something sticky like tape, and she won't be able to get her claws into it like she may be able to get them into fabric. (Don't worry, I don't know of any double-sided tape that would be strong enough to actually trap her or anything.)<br>  <br>  You might want to buy something like a "Scat Mat" product. There are many commercial mats and pads that you can buy. When the dog jumps on it, it makes a very loud and unpleasant noise. This startles the dog and really discourages the behavior. Just place the mats on the areas she jumps on, like the table.<br>  <br>  If you're with her, just pay attention to everything she's doing, at least out of the corner of her eye. The second she tries to jump onto the table or something, make a sharp "AH-AHT!" noise and take her off the table. If she dislikes being squirted by a water bottle, you can squirt her the second she jumps up. You can carry around a little blowhorn with you and blow it the moment she jumps up. <br>  You may have to do this quite a bit to make the lesson sink in, so be patient, and remember to be consistent! Every time you let her stay on the table, she thinks she'll be allowed to do it. You have to consistently remove her from the table so she sort of loses all hope of being able to jump up. Also, timing is key, so make sure you respond immediately.|`|CxoKHDzqaa	Take her out more often. Let her roam around to let her get used to things. At least let her explore. Question is, do you let her out often. My dog dog acts like he's a cat sometimes. He's a weirdo. We say that he's part human/dog/cat/turkey/cheetah & something else. He's really cute though.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	She doesn't think she's a cat, she's just curious and wants to explore! Take her on regular walks, but remember, she is still a puppy and like a baby/toddler, they're full of curiosity which will soon die down as they mature.|`|K2dNndE2aa	all puppies do that! especially if you just got her. they like to explore. a lot of puppies act like cats. they're new to the world-just like toddlers-and like to explore things.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	That is so cute. I wouldn't worry about her acting like a cat. Some dogs are more apt to climbing than others. She has obviously learned to get places by using this method. She is short and wants to see whats going on. I guess she figures she can hop on furniture to get somewhere quicker!|`|5yhitoY0aa	These are all the habits of these animals.The puppies will also behave like a cat, after all they are of same type.So not to worry with this.Give her proper training and take for regular walks etc|`|mBlcD6sRaa	give the puppy some  katnip
zMCLlOwuaa	Unfortunately most sweet feeds contain molasses and other sweeteners and are loaded with carbs. This can be ok for a horse who is burning a lot of Energy. But Just like people who sit around and eating candy all the time and no exercise, its bad for your blood sugar levels. <br>  For both of them high fiber diets are good. Fiber will help them maintain adequate body weight and condition without fattening them. I keep my easy keepers all grass hay and on Nutrena Lite Balance; pricey but worth it. Then for my younger horse who is still filling out, he can't have a lot of these higher protein and carb feeds cause they make him hot, so he get a tiny bit of alfalfa instead. Plus added corn oil<br>  You'll find whatever personally works for you.  I do like the Nutrena brand feeds though and on there website, they offer tips and nutrition on all of there feeds to help you decide which one your horses need.<br>  As a basic rule of thumb, if you cannot give your horse the recommended amount of feed instructed on the bag because it either makes them too hot, not enough or too much, then it's not the right feed for them and they are not getting the nutrients they need.|`|H3ktCe3Eaa	I used to feed my 8 year old pony a handful of oats everyday when he was fat, and just let him graze all day. <br>  But at the same time, I feed my 25 year old gelding a gallon of old horse food. Yeah, a whole gallon.  (He doesn't like to graze, because he's missing his front teeth.  Poor thing.)<br>  But I'm not sure what oats would to do for your gelding, because it might make him energetic.<br>  But oats are cheap, soooooo.<br>  Hope this helps a little!|`|JCNEP903aa	my suggestion is to talk to your vet and get some education about digestinal issues. it'll save you alot of money (being this is an issue) and maintain a healthy and happy animal. As far as your gelding, that's his "spirit"  don't try to break him from that unless he's exhibiting nasty behavioral problems. Use his enthusiastic behavior to the good. Use your imagination and develop a game for him so he doesn't get bored. I know this sounds crazy, but, I've seen some crazier things that have worked for me. Get him one of those great big ball from a toy store or a 55 gallon plastic barrel for him to roll and nudge with his nose.

avJsey6uaa	I understand, kittens are all too lovely. But you must respect your parent's house, as you live there. Don't be materialistic, chasing after the cute and cuddly babies, when your cats, I'm sure, would love for some of that attention and energy you're giving on this kitten-lust.<br>  <br>  But, if you think you'd be responsible enough (cleaning the litter box, feeding them, loving ALL THREE of them, I'm SURE, if you're parents would be gracious enough to let you have another), try telling them about adopting from a shelter. Kittens and cats lay around miserable in their cages all day waiting for someone to love them. If your parents would be willing, you would do a tremendous service for animals by adopting a homeless feline. Offer to pay for the fee yourself or do work for your parents that they feel will make up for it. Adopting an animal from a shelter does require paying for it, and the shelter checking if you can appropriately care for the animal. Unfortunately, there are too many times someone adopts from a shelter, only to bring the animal back, traumatized from being abandoned once again. Shelters go to great loving lengths to assure that their animals don't have to go through the pain of abandonment, so allow the shelter to do what they have to do. If they should find you unfit, then you are. <br>  <br>  And if you are fit, PLEASE LOVE ALL THREE OF YOUR ANIMALS! Don't give the kitten (or cat, who knows, you could fall in love with a one-eyed, scraggly old tom with a longing for a family), all of your attention because it is new and sparkly. They are your children, and need equal amounts of love from you.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Please keep in mind that a "stray" cat may well belong to someone else and be someone's beloved pet. Love the kitties you have.
2947eqSGaa	I think five months old is a little young for toilet training your kitty. But anyway, you can't expect your cat to smile and nod when you show her what to do. Maybe she's annoyed, maybe she doesn't understand, maybe she understands perfectly and just wants to look at you. <br>  Nobody can tell you why your cat looks at you in any special way.
a29qiNkvaa	You will be just fine! I reused both of my Akita’s when they were about 2 years old and they are totally bonded to us!  They are amazing dogs! If the dog was around other people there should be no issues with aggression! I strongly suggest you do classes with your new puppy and try to socialize the puppy as much as you can with other dogs! Good luck and congrats on the puppy!|`|930525fae9ce50d25e62f663d2250380aa	Can you visit with her for several days, and then take her home?  Take her out for a walk, play with her, see if she will get along with you.  It is never too late to decide from there, and it will be fair to both you and the dog.  Never be afraid of a bigger bread, as it can sense or smell the fear in you, and then the dog will think it is boss.  Take her into the house and plan ahead now.  Will she be put in a pen at night?  Will she have restrictions?  What areas will be off limits?  It is not easy to change rules as an incident shows up.  You have to be fair.  This is a smart dog, but their understanding is like that of a 4 or 5 year old child.  You cannot say yes today no tomorrow, or the other way around.  You have to be constant.  You have to also teach it rules while walking.  You have to be able to exercise it twice a day, and also play with with it for fun at least twice a day.  Then it will be a happy dog.  A mean Akita is hard to take care of.  Know what you are getting.  If the owners love dogs, they will understand you trying to get used to it for a week or maybe two before you actually take it home.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing about all dogs, when they are good and behaving, tell them how good they are.  All animals like us, love to be recognized and praised.  They too would rather be praised than scolded.  <br>  Good Luck!

29Um8OCvaa	Well, what do you mean, "fighting"? They may be mating, because mating in livebearers can look a LOT like fighting. If your male is biting the female's behind, then it is most definately mating! I suggest you get another couple females, to spread out the male's attention. That will make him calmer, and eventually he will just stick by the females' sides, instead of chasing them around like a freak.<br>  <br>  Cheers!
qgeI6Chxaa	It depends on the age of your dogs. Pet insurance doesn't cover pre-existing conditions, so if your dogs are treated for a recurring problem insurance won't cover it. It won't cover breed-specific health issues either. The best way to use pet insurance is to cover puppies, which don't have pre-existing conditions and will need enough vet attention in the first year to make it worthwhile.<br>  <br>  I don't think paying $800 a year (plus the deductible) is going to be worth it if your dogs are already adults and are just getting routine care.|`|eVQ8qcnhaa	I agree, pet insurance is not worth it unless they are 6 weeks to a year or maybe even when they are quite a bit older. Also if you do the math it cost you 700 for the 4 dogs and for pet insurance it would cost you over 800, so you would probably be loosing money unless something major happened. Its good to know there are still responsible dog owners out there!!

She may be choosing this spot for nesting. You should have had a place chosen for her. Like a shallow kiddy pool with towels.

You could have even searched step by step instructions online through google... but it appears you couldn't manage that either.

bDPVRtCNaa	I need some additional information before I can help you-<br>  <br>  1. Tank size?<br>  2. By black fish, do you mean common pleco?<br>  3. How do you clean your tank, and how often?<br>  <br>  Unless you have otocinclus, keeping four algae eaters in your aquarium is really not necessary. One will do the job, four creates a huge bioload that may stress the system.<br>  <br>  ~But how do you clean it? Do you remove everything? Water and all? <br>  If so, stop. Never completely clean out your aquarium. It puts the system back to square one. A 100% water change removes the beneficial bacteria that breaks down fish waste. This will cause an ammonia spike which can cause red streaks on fish. Ammonia is lethal and will cause fish death.<br>  -Weekly water changes of 25% using a gravel siphon should be enough for a properly stocked aquarium. Upon finding a dead fish, again, 25% is all that is required.<br>  <br>  ~Tank dimensions? Your definition of big, and mine, may not be the same.<br>  -Your tank is roughly twenty gallons. If this pleco does not survive, I do not recommend buying another one. The common pleco should ideally have greater than 55 gallons. A smaller variety pleco would be more acceptalble such as a bristlenose or a rubberlip.<br>  <br>  ~EDIT~ To take care of your fish, you need to take care of your water. You need to test your water for the presence of ammonia. Though pet stores will often test a sample of your water for free, I would suggest buying a test kit to use at home. Waiting until a tank is visibly dirty is not a good idea. It means that water quality has become poor between cleanings. Poor water quality spells poor health for fish.<br>  <br>  To clean your aquarium- Once a week use a gravel siphon to vacuum the substrate and remove about 25% of the water. Replace with conditioned water of the right temperature.<br>  If the aquarium tests positive for ammonia I would suggest daily water changes of about 25% until the level is at zero.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	You should read up on fish diseases and how to keep your fish healthy.|`|gzpaMVnqaa	It is hard to say exactly what the problem is from your description, but if this is a new tank your problem is probably due to poor water quality. Red around fins can be due to high ammonia or nitrate levels in the tank. A new tank needs time to cycle, which is the process of growth of bacteria in the tank that process these wastes. A new tank without the proper biological populations will become toxic quite quickly once fish are added. The best thing to do now is to change 25% of the water daily. You might want to pick up a product that helps to establish the proper bacterial population (like "Cycle") but they are of limited use once the tank is already overloaded with waste. Make sure you have a filter in there too. If most of the fish die, don't go out and buy new ones right away. Continue to do water changes and pick up a water chemistry testing kit so you can see if ammonia and nitrates are high.That's the best I can tell you. Generally, if in doubt, water changes will help. The website below will give you some good info on cycling your tank.|`|1dbC3SKVaa	omg they are about to die
CqquoBy4aa	You need to get a tank/aquarium. the water needs to be about 70 degrees. You just have to cover it less than the whole tank.

If he doesn't eat the pellets, let him hunt for his own food.|`|gs2aPltGaa	you need to get a tank/aquarium. the water needs to be about 70 degrees. do not fill the tank all the way, just enough to cover him with room to swim. you also need a log or what i use for my turtles are landscaping rocks.

bIaywrBCaa	how old is he? If he is getting older, he could be going blind and that could be causing a lot of things you describe.|`|ydshiNrKaa	It could be a number of things. it might be neurological or maybe something with his eyes, or maybe something with his inner ear.  He needs to be seen by the vet and some tests done on him before it gets worse.|`|bicAgoycaa	It sounds like he has a brain tumor. Or he could also have distemper.

Don't make him suffer any longer by wondering. He cant tell you how he feels, so use common sense and be the owner he needs.|`|cfbc847f69b8c58c2a9f0c1c7fd702c4aa	I agree with most of the responses.  My dog started doing similar things.  He needs to be seen by the Vet ASAP.  The vet needs to run a blood test on him and check all of his levels.  My dog started doing this about 2 days before seizures started attacking him.  The seizures were due to a brain tumor.  If blood tests come back ok, he more than likely has some neurological problems such as a brain tumor.  He knows there isn't something right with his body and dogs often "hide" in a safe place when this happens.  You owe it to him to take him to the vet and get him checked out.  Hope all ends well for you and your companion.

tPGxPDvBaa	You aren't bathing her properly then if she isn't getting wet.  Puppies smell - nothing will remove puppy odor.  Using any puppy shampoo which usually doesn't contain much as far as perfumes/scent since they can irritate a puppy skin will work for a bath.  You may need a better sprayer or water pressure to get water into her coat.
i5zBmtqRaa	I work at a veterinary clinic.  There are many options out there for flea prevention and treatment.  One of the newest and safest monthly flea preventatives is called Comfortis.  It's a once monthly pill that's chewable.  So since it's a non-topical method, it won't be toxic to other animals.  It also doesn't leave the animal's fur all greasy and chemical-smelling.  Frontline and Advantage could theoretically be licked off by other pets or you can spread it when you pet your animal.   The flea collars don't work well and are not worth your time or money.  This is because the flea repellent just sits on the surface of the skin in one area.  It would be great if all fleas hung out around the dog's neck, but they don't.  So you need to either get a topical treatment that gets absorbed in the skin, or an oral medication that is ingested.|`|4jyAH75vaa	I had a collar once for my cat and it didn't do anything.  If you wait until fleas are present and give them a bath it could work, but your dog was uncomfortable all that time and now you have fleas in the house.  Monthly preventatives are definitely the best way to go.  I use Advantix on my dog and Revolution for my cat, my parents use Frontline for their dog, we've never had problems with any of these products.<br>  <br>  One consideration is what else they protect against...you definitely want one that also protects against tick, which both Frontline and Advantix do.  Advantix also repels mosquitos, which minimizes the risk of heartworm infection and other diseases like West Nile.  Revolution for dogs is also a heartworm preventative, but no tick protection.  You also want to make sure that whatever topical you use is waterproof if your dog likes to swim|`|bicAgoycaa	Ok, to be quite honest ... frontline is the best BUT...<br>  <br>  Frontline is in the process of reengenering their formula because fleas are starting to become immune to it. Flea colors don't work very well because they wear quickly. They do work great in your vacumm cleaner however.<br>  <br>  Just be cautious of flea prevention not sold at vets offices because they have been known to be toxic and even kill dogs.<br>  <br>  I know this because my brother is a vet and I call to ask him questions all of the time.<br>  <br>  Frontline is your best choice at the moment. If you have a sever flea problem, your vet can give your pet a pill of sorts that will immediately kill the fleas on them, but it's not a preventative.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CcESWX5vaa	frontline|`|c4225d9583bacc6aaa33ccf6f6ca917aaa	frontline and advantage work the same.. either is fine..just whichever you can find that is cheaper..  bathe once a month, wait atleast two days for the skin to dry, then apply the flea meds (once a month)|`|Y02abtiwaa	frontline is the safest. flea collars dont always work and sometimes give the dog weird reactions. i guess baths are ok, but frontline is the easiest!
bDPVRtCNaa	Fish do like a period of rest just like we do, he could very well be catching some shut-eye. Shut off his light and remove any other disturbances such as a stereo or a television that may disturb him during the night.<br>  <br>  Be aware that resting on the bottom excessively could also be a sign that you have ammonia problems. Be sure that you are keeping up with your weekly partial water changes, and that your aquarium is appropriately sized for a goldfish.|`|W5W29lP5aa	my little angel did this today it died about 1 hour ago and no it's not okay if it rest against the gravel and its on it's sides than good buy goldfish
boOi7xJJaa	Not if they are Syrian (teddy bear) hamsters. All Syrian hamsters need to be housed as singles once they are adults. <br>  Dwarf hamsters are social and can be kept in same sex groups, mother and daughters and father with sons if fine.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	No, you'll want to remove the babies from the mother's cage at about 3 weeks when the mother weans them naturally anyway. This will prevent any inbreeding. The father shouldn't be around the babies as he may view them as a threat to his territory and probably will kill them all. Only thing you can do is take out the babies at 21 days and separate the males and females.|`|pvrLSTZzaa	I have four female mice and three of the four were from breeding. We had Algernon and Squeak and we kept Cookies after Algernon had her litter. Then Cookie got pregers from Squeak and had brownie. After we got rid of Squeak, Algernon had another litter and we kept one more. There is nothing wrong with hamsters/mice inbreeding.
OyNJTWaiaa	If the vet was standing there watching why didnt he intervene if the bird was being held incorrectly. On the job training at its worst. <br>  She may have held him to tight around the head and crop area, forcing it ro regurgitate and take the contents into its lungs and aspirate. <br>  Heart attack is the most common EXCUSE for any number of reasons birds die...the sad truth is...it is rarely ever the true reason.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	It isn't as easy to strangle a bird as it is to strangle a mammal. What it sounds like to me was that the tech was holding him too tight around the body. Birds don't have diaphragms, and thus you can't put too much pressure there while holding them or they will suffocate. <br>  <br>  If he was in good health beforehand, then I highly doubt he had a heart attack. A beak trim can be very stressful to a parrot, but I've never met a parrot who thought it was so stressful that it killed them. <br>  <br>  That said, I'm not a vet. I'm just a volunteer at an avian shelter, and owner of parrots. It's something that I've had done on tame and non-tame parrots alike. They often didn't like it, but never did something like THAT happen.<br>  <br>  Did they have you sign any kind of waiver that said they weren't responsible for anything bad that happened? If not, then I would raise some serious hell with them over this. Even if he did die of a heart attack, they need to take responsibility for it, because they should have known to stop or sedate him if it was becoming too stressful for him. MAKE THEM TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.<br>  <br>  That said... I'm terribly sorry for your loss. I hope that this situation can be resolved in the best way possible.|`|1e1eUHr3aa	Poor Bird. I own a bird myself, and he's 17 years old. Cockateil. Well i'm not sure how he died but birds can get Scared easily. He might have been scared to death. I'm not sure.|`|bicAgoycaa	He really could have had a heart attack. It's easy to stress them out to the point to where their hearts cant take it.|`|r2kfmiq3aa	omg im so sorry. It is very easy to stress birds out.|`|1omgPICKaa	Oh, I am so sorry to hear. :( The vet doesn't sound too nice.<br>  <br>  If a bird suffocates, it's usually the way you hold them around their tummy. If a bird's middle is clamped onto too tight, they will struggle to breathe. A bird can put up with being hold on firmly by the back of the neck and the vet has probably held many birds before.<br>  If she had somehow twisted his neck and broken it, I think it might have been heard and your cockatiel would have sounded like it was in much pain.<br>  <br>  Birds commonly die from stress. It is not unknown for them to die from stress during normal vet checkups. They do get heart attacks from it.<br>  <br>  If this is the case, there are some ways to prevent it if you ever get another bird. Play the 'towel' game with it, get it use to having a towel placed over it (play 'peek a boo') and being wrapped up in a towel. If possible, get it use to having its wings, nails and beak touched.<br>  Make sure the bird has cuttlebone, natural perches with bark to chew on, and a pedi perch to prevent the beak from getting overgrown and therefore requiring clipping.<br>  <br>  Again, I am so sorry to hear. My lorikeet died recently and he was very special to me, so I know that it must hurt a lot.

iLrp65oXaa	I ordered this dog tag from my locally owned pet supply store.  They are made by Red Dingo and are very good quality.  My dog is 14 pounds and i ordered the small size.

Many dog mushers use a rectangular metal ID tag that we then rivet to the collar (rivets can be purchased at nearly any hardware store for cheap).  I recommend an identification microchip or ear tattoo in addition to the collar.  It is possible for a dog to slip out of a collar or for a thief to destroy the collar, but the chip will last the dog's entire life.  <br>  <br>  My training partner prefers the "Boomerang" ID tags that she buys on-line.  They are also unlikely to become separated from the collar and seem to work very well for her.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I had a dog for 7 years that wore the same tag every single day.  He was stolen and.... well, I won't mention what happened to him, but I can say that the tag was the only thing that made it through the experience without a scratch.  It was just a simple aluminum tag that was engraved using lasers (not as expensive as it sounds).  I STILL have that tag (and its been 3 years since his death, so 10 years all together).  If that's the same kind you have, I can't imagine what your dog is doing to destroy it.  Especially at only 12 pounds.<br>  <br>  May I suggest a micro chip?  It goes under their skin and is in an international database.  If anyone in the entire world finds him, they'll be able to pull up your information when they scan the chip.  Then again, that's assuming the person that finds them actually takes them somewhere to be scanned.|`|C0T0hV4haa	There is a compnay that makes dog tags look like license plates.  They are pretty neat.  My girl Kona has one for Mass and for Texas and will probably have a few more in her life.
rXMTdUg4aa	Its about 15 to 30 dollars a shot at a vet clinic. You can't buy vaccines in single inject-ables... I don't think. The distemper packs we get in usually contain about 30 vaccs.

What I do not recommend though is getting it from a feed and seed store.  They may be local, but a lot of times they will pre mix it... a pre mixed vaccine doesn't last and expires much quicker.   I get my 7-Way shots through www.drfostersmith.com  they get here quickly and its not that expensive.  It's around $6 for a 7-way shot, its just the shipping and handling thats a little more expensive but by going through them you eliminate less traveling and less hands dealing with it.  It's just safer to get them from that site than a feed and seed store.  <br>  <br>  Good luck finding one you like!<br>  <br>  Don't forget, as I'm sure you know but others may not... You HAVE to go to your vet annually for the Rabies shot... you cannot administer it yourself.    :)

KEYgd73saa	The base of the photic zone is phytoplankton, which photosynthesize.  Zooplankton eat the phytoplankton, and these are the closest you'll get to open water "vegans".  Closer to shore, where there is more macroalgae (kelp, in particular), you'll find more truly herbivorous animals, like urchins (though some will munch on corals) and certain fish.  However, virtually all of the animals also get eaten by something higher up on the food chain, and many things will resort to omnivory, like baleen whales, which eat massive amounts of both phytoplankton and zooplankton, and anything else that gets sieved through their mouths.|`|gzpaMVnqaa	Sure.

She gave you 13 years of her love and now is the time to return the favor and help her move on to a peaceful life.|`|8JDxBlcVaa	i think its time. it sounds like she isnt too happy. and she has lived a long life! i would put her out of the struggles.<br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry :[<br>  <br>  im a sucker for animals|`|EBkW1ME4aa	yes, if i had the dog, i would put it down. NOt for myself and my comforts, such as extended sleep and less towels to wash, but the dog deserves it, come on, she's 13 years old and sick and frail. If i was like that, i would want to be put down. I mean, she doesn't do anything right? just stay at home to mope and suffer from all that unbearable pain.|`|X4RaGIaLaa	she's probably not in pain but you should put her to sleep cuz she's really old... or the arthritis might hurt|`|AA10824931	It doesn't sound like she has any good days.  I know how you feel for I am facing the same problem with my almost 13 year old dog.  I asked a similar question about a month ago and the answers I received was <br>  "she will let you know".  But your dog may be too far gone.  I would put her to sleep if my dog was using the house for a yard.  Good luck with your decision and I know it's a hard one.|`|KI4NieoTaa	My dog was like that, he wouldnt eat.<br>  Did wee and poo in the house.<br>  Bumped into things when it was dark, and walk up and down the hallway, all the time, non stop.<br>  He couldnt take one step to go outside, so we had to put a ramp there for him.<br>  He didnt wee or poo in his normal spot, he just went anywhere.<br>  And he had a very sad look in his eyes all the time.<br>  Even though he might/might not have been in pain, he was still sick, and we had to get him put down.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your dog needs to be to, we all know its difficult, but then he could be in pain?<br>  would you rather him live in pain, until he passes away?<br>  Or let him rest in peace now?|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It is 100% up to you. i think if its just a mental health issue that she should be able to live out her days as anyone would.<br>  If she is losing control of her organs and is in pain then I would consider euthanizing|`|pd16sn5vaa	Well, you can bring her to the vet and ask for medication that will make her life more comfortable if you dont want to put her down.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	I think you should ask the vet about what's wrong with the dog. I know it's very hard, but if I were you, I'd really have her put to sleep.|`|i0MQe6Fnaa	well go to ur vet and consult the best thing to do|`|6M1Z3XIdaa	talk it over with her vet. maybe there is something the vet can do for her to make her feel better. but it sounds like it is time to at least talk about it. <br>  it is one of the hardest decisions to make if the dog isn't extremely sick or hurt. and if you keep wondering about it, then it is getting to be that time. i have had to put a physically healthy dog down because mentally he had gotten to the point where he was attacking us almost constantly. luckily he was a little guy. but i've put sick and injured dogs down and it wasn't nearly as hard as him. <br>  good luck.|`|B462BQYzaa	it sounds like it's time for her - can u bear seeing her continue on like this? sometimes loving any animal or person is not keeping them alive for as long as you can, it's also know when it's the right time to let go.  In this case, you will be showing love to her by taking away her pain and misery - she feels the love by being with you gusy but it sounds like she is no longer living the quality life she once did and have stepped into the grave already.  give a good last meal and take her into the vet to put her to sleep.  it's the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  for kiltorina - you have the dumbest most immature response here - it's not keeping a living thing alive that shows u love them, my grandma is in the hospital for the past couple years, she cannnot talk, she cannot open her eyes, cannot even respond. One day, her heart stopped beating, someone makes the irresponsible decision of giving her an adrenalin shot to the heart.  If it's someone or something's time to go you should let them rest in peace instead of having them live through pain.  It's not the idea of wanting them to die, it's the idea of letting them rest in peace before they can no longer bear the pain.  My brother is doctor, after hearing what happened, he wanted no part to do with whoever made that decision, sometimes with medicine, you have no idea how much pain and suffering there is, just cuz it makes yourself feel better does it necessarily make them feel better? grow up for crying out loud.|`|JITTMjasaa	That's a hard question and I'm sure it was hard to ask. I'm sorry for your dilemma. I would just look at it this way. If her life is not a happy one for her, it's time to end it. If she is suffering or in pain there is no need to continue, otherwise it is not fair to her. You may have options as to what you can do to prolong her life but it will be expensive and might not be worth it to you or your dog. Look up several different vet's, call them up and ask them. See what they say. They have to make this decision all the time so they should be able to help you. Just make sure you get many opinions. One vet may recommend something completely different from the next one so you will have to use your best judgement. You know your dog better than anyone else so you have the final say. Just let your hubby know that if she is suffering, it is not fair to her to prolong it in keeping her alive. You may have to do a little bit of consoling for his benefit. Again, I'm sorry for your dilemma. Best of luck to you. God Bless|`|eoUHF4x2aa	There is an injection that relieves your dogs arthritis for 2 whole years. Apparently it should make your dog act like a young pup again. Get your Zombie to the vet and get that injection.<br>  <br>  You need to get a dog door so she can come in and out of the house freely because even human bladders get weaker as they get older.<br>  <br>  Find an off the leash park so she can go for regular runs and get her a ‘Buster Cube’ to stimulate her brain. <br>  <br>  She sounds board and depressed.<br>  Don’t kill her.|`|FoEfJovgaa	Your concern means you are a good dog owner.  This is a very tough decision for you and your family.  The best advice I can give is take your dog to the vet to determine if your dog is indeed in pain, or if it's still living strong.  The vet will give you an opinion of what he or she would do but it is still up to you.  Best of Wishes!|`|vw201sblaa	NO!!! I have done this now to two animals, more for health reasons than for age. But to this day when i think about it, i regret it. I would have wanted the extra few days with them instead of 'forcing their hands'  It sounds like she is getting to her time, which really sucks, but its always better to have just one more day... now i need to go cry :( I miss my dog :(|`|ufcmMqQ5aa	If you can't stand to put her to sleep, you should buy some baby diapers, cut a tail hole and at least save your floors. My Shih Tzu was able to stay with me for a couple of years after she started to pee on the floor just by doing this|`|LaqT3K4Gaa	personally, i do not want to hear her suffer and i think she has lived her life the way she wants to but it's up to you<br>  (And i have always loved animals ALWAYS but i think it's the best thing for her)<br>  hope i helped you make ur decision|`|juwDsPaZaa	I think the best thing to do is to call your vet and ask their opinion and maybe schedule her an appointment for the vet to assess her.|`|ZGTGf6AIaa	Sadly as it might seems, it's probably time. All dogs (& humans & other animals) have their time. :(|`|gUBgKegjaa	if shes sick yes so she doesnt suffer but if shes not dont ley her have her life tell she dies or shes sick so let her live|`|XU9kfVmKaa	sounds like its time for the poor baby to go sorry i love animals but its your call|`|CcESWX5vaa	i would talk to my vet n see what he thinks. let him make the decision.|`|9aKp5OMNaa	i would put her out of her misery if i where u|`|XmhYNlumaa	no she can still live just take her to the vet IF u havent yet. try using a diper to stop the urine. try playing with her shes probably lonely and want a friend. see how she reacts to other dogs u dont know that could be it if u havent tried. just wait till she passes. those are the only tips i could give thats how i treated my friends dog and she died 3 years later. srry for ur dog :(|`|t8GjNSgDaa	It sounds like sadly it is time for you to let your girl go. I know it is a hard thing to do but you need to look at your girl and ask yourself am I keeping her alive for her sake or mine. If the answer is that you are keeping her alive for your sake then please have her humanely put down to end her suffering and the guilt that you are feeling. you may want to get another dog to help ease the suffering that you will be feeling after the loss of your girl. Your new dog will not replace your girl but it will help fill the void in your heart.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	aww :( im sorry :( maybe you should just go to the vet to see if theres anyway they can help. but think of her quality of life. you dont want her in pain her last days. but i know what your going thrue. im 19 and we got my dog when i was 6. and shes doing the same thing. and we dont know what to do either. bcuz she also seems to be in pain. i really am sorry :(( but just think of the dog, i guess :(((
AA10412922	Many nose color changes are seasonal,it's called a winter nose.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	My vet said our dogs nose turns brown from eating out of her plastic dog dish, but our other dog doesn't have the same problem. So its how she eats different and rubs her nose a lot. Maybe the same thing?|`|f05xJi31aa	Sometimes they turn brown (and it is not permanent) from being dry. Winter is the season that you notice it the most, but nothing is wrong with the dog. You can rub a little vaseline on it to keep it moist, just as when our hands become dry and crack (fingers) in the winter, so does the dog's nose. Don't worry about it. It is not a serious. Neither of my dogs don't have it, but they eat some times out of plastic bowls. That means nothing.<br>  Don't worry, the fur babies are fine!
ydshiNrKaa	LOL, that would be a wonderful trick and save a lot of hassel with all new puppy owners.  Of course she doesn't teach the pups to be house trained.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Dams teach their puppies dog manners, not human manners. <br>  <br>  They train the pups in how to behave amongst dogs by teaching them what's considered rude. Stepping on, nipping, mouthing and being rough with another dog is often poor manners unless it is clear that both dogs want to play. These are lessons that puppies pick up from their mothers. <br>  <br>  However, dogs are dogs, so they don't teach puppies human lessons. It's our "weird" human lesson to teach a dog how to potty outside versus inside, so it's us to up to teach that lesson.<br>  <br>  Dogs can learn by example, though. It is possible for puppies to follow a dam's behavior in "going" outside, for instance.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Nope. One kind of training a mother dog will do is to stop her pups from fighting with each other. She will discipline one by putting that pup away from the group for a short amount of time.|`|LZeta5niaa	No way! I don't think so. You should do some proper research, really.|`|CcESWX5vaa	you can try this after its had its  shots take it out when you take the mother out to potty might help it learn by going outside with mom alot.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	No she wouldn't teach that, but yes a dam does teach her pups things they need to know before leaving her.|`|fTQmn5V3aa	Well, no, not really, but she does lay down the groundwork for you (the new owner of the pup) to follow.<br>  The dam reinforces the instinct for the pup not to soil its nest. You just have to teach the pup how far away from the nest it needs to go to do its business (and maybe give it a lift to get there).
wADItPRyaa	"Harlequin"  or "Harlequin Romance" would be cute.|`|JCNEP903aa	majestic rhapsody especially if he has a real smooth gait. Name him something that goes with his characteristics. They tend to react to them better. My dobie went through tons of names before he responded to one he liked. It's kind of like us when we hear a song, some we like, some we hate, and some we run out buy the single and wear it out!!! Listen and watch his reaction to different names. You'll see what I mean. Nature doesn't lie. As you say the name, say it with enthusiasm, but, gently and quietly.

He will do this to try and please you when he gets excited, as well as sit, heel and down because he is happy to see me and wants treats! He is not under exercised, just silly! But yes I also think the other answers about people thinking littler dogs don't need as much exercise is correct when in reality they need just as much as my huskies need.|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	This can be caused by stressors such as over-stimulation in your home environment, combined with lack of a quiet place to escape to. I agree with catkeypurr...the dog most likely needs more exercise, it is not a breed thing. This can create a long term behavior.  When you catch your dog doing this reinforce him/her with a toy or treat to break the cycle. Have more sessions like brushing or petting him/her so they won't be so intent on circling.  Break the cycle. Hope this helps.|`|1zTheHOQaa	larger dogs that don't get enough exercise usually do that, or the smaller breeds that are hard to train because they have size issues and like to do their own thing!|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	It's because they don't get enough exercise.  And they are poorly trained.  No "Certain Breeds" do this.<br>  <br>  Just under exercised untrained dogs.

OyNJTWaiaa	Check under his foot for sores. If you have sandpaper sheets in the bottom of the cage or sandpaper perches...remove them. They are harmful to budgies. Have natural wooden perches made from safe non toxic branches of differing diameters so his feet get better exercise.<br>  <br>  <br>  **You have so far posted this question three times.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	One possiblity is that your budgie could have arthritis.  Budgies are known to scrunch up their feet when they are in pain with arthritis.  If your budgie is still able to perch and there's no inflammed areas, the arthritis may be in the early stages.  I'd see a vet if you suspect arthritis.<br>  <br>  Here is a link on arthritis in birds:<br>  <a href="http://www.tailfeathersnetwork.com/birdinformation/arthritis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tailfeathersnetwork.com/birdi...</a><br>  <br>  Another possibility is that the budgie's perch could be hurting his feet.  Sandpaper perches are very hard on a pet bird's feet.  Check for sores or lesions on the foot.  Budgies need a variety of different size perches made of different materials, for example, wood, pumice, natural branch.  <br>  <br>  In addition, he could have a condition called bumblefoot.   Your budgie's foot will look like it has calluses on it.  This condition is often caused by a poor diet.  Sandpaper perches can make this condition worse.  If you suspect your budgie has bumblefoot, please take it to the vet.  The foot can become infected and he can become very ill if this condition isn't treated.<br>  <br>  Here's a link for more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/bumblefoot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/bumblefoot.html</a>

NBfBKI1Uaa	First the this particular trigger fish that called Humu (not Huma) is not very aggressive but is rather territorial . But it is still capable of attacking smaller fishes such as your clown.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile Lionfish will is predatory fish and will attack and consume smaller fish that they can eat. Clownfish is an ideal candidate. <br>   <br>  <br>  Lionfish and Trigger are not suitable tank mates in such small 90 gallon tank. I am surprise they have start attacking one another and all other tank mates.<br>  <br>  Protein skimmer is an very important equipment in any saltwater tank. Without a skimmer you can expect lot of nuisance algae. <br>  Whatever you do stay away from SeaClone and Visi Jet as they are simply junk.<br>  <br>  There are number of different types of skimmer.

XoAavDz8aa	The qualities you described can be found in any dog.  What you want to think about most is your energy level.  The dogs you described have three different energy levels.  A pug is high energy, boston terrier is medium, and a french bulldog is medium-low.  If you are looking for a play-all-day dog then a pug would be good.  If you just want a snuggle bug then the french bulldog would be best.  Or if you want an in between go with the boston.  However there are several other breeds you might want to look into as well.  Here is a list of toy breeds.  You can also use this website to research other breeds and even find reputable breeders or breed rescues.  Never buy from a backyard breeder or random pet store.  Reputable breeders care about their dogs and ensure that they are healthy and well taken care of.  A few things you want to look for are Pedigree papers, hip evaluations, and a return policy (even if you don't want to part with your dog regardless of circumstances this shows that the owner wants to ensure the best for their litter.)|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	I would have to say boston terrier. Those are known to be very kid friendly. Just like any other dog, You have to make sure you socialize it with other dogs. Whether or not the breed you choose is dog friendly depends on how well you socialize it.
N70orPJ6aa	Well to be completely sure of what sex your Leo is... you'll have to wait until it's over 6 months old. From your description it sounds like it's a male. They have a single bulge by the vent as well as the V shaped pores. Females dont really have a noticeable bump or femoral pores. Try to sex it again in another month or so, if you still see the single bulge and the pores, it's a male.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Leos can be accurately sexed right out of the egg by using a jewelers 10X loupe magnifying glass.<br>  <br>  However, for visually sexing with the naked eye, age is useless.

Once a male reaches 35+ grams he should definitely have the V-shaped femoral pores, if not it's a female.<br>  <br>  Females can and DO have the femoral pores, they just aren't as defined and porous as the males.........instead their pores are slightly indented(sometimes), but not functional.|`|pcvcMePXaa	well it sounds like a male to me, females dont have a bulge at the base of the tail, id wait a couple more months to be completely sure if you still not sure take it to an reptile store that specializes in exotics and they'll tell you|`|wLgGD63raa	You can sex your Leo's as early as six weeks old, but should really wait until six months to be sure. Since your gecko is around six months, here is how to tell:<br>  <br>  Males have a row of pores that are "V" shaped right before the anus. Females do not have these pores, but they do sometimes have enlarged "scales" in this same area.

jy47TEVkaa	Dry food is fine.  None of my cats eat wet food, they don't even care for it.  Just make sure it's a nutritionally balanced, higher quality food specifically for kittens.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	The latest research shows that canned food is the diet that cats should be eating.  Dry food was created for our convenience, and not because it's good for our cats.  Domesticated for a long time or not, a cat is still a carnivore, just a domesticated one.  They eat meat not grains.  Dry foods high in grains are now linked to such feline disorders as obesity, diabetes, urinary tract disorders, and even kidney issues.  And dry food also does NOT clean the teeth.  Look at a cat's teeth, and you'll see they are designed for ripping meat, not for chewing.  And watch a cat eat, they don't chew.  They bite the kibble, and then swallow the pieces.  <br>  <br>  I just got back from my vet's office last week.  She's an experienced vet from one of the finest schools in the country, and attends 4-6 weeks of education to stay current in cat care each year.  She's been an advocate of feeding a quality canned diet to cats for years, and now has the work of lots of researchers to back that up.  I'm trying to wean my last dry food junkie off the kibbles (at the doctor's orders), but all that we feed at my house is a grain-free dry, which is the "best of the worst" as one poster always puts it. <br>  <br>  You'll have a healthier kitten if you start the canned food now, instead of trying to get him off that dry food later in life if any of the health issues manifest themselves.|`|YBcB0732aa	You can feed only dry food but it's not  good as wet food.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	What is most important is that you feed your kitten food made for kittens!  So, what you are feeding her now is perfect.<br>  <br>  The pet food nazis would have you believe that you are killing your pet if you don't feed it precisely the food it would be eating if the cat was never domesticated and living in the wild.<br>  <br>  That is rubbish.<br>  <br>  1)  The cat has been domesticated for over 5,000 years.<br>  2)  The diets they promote would be akin to asking humans to eat a macrobiotic diet.  Is it doable?  Yes.  Is it necessary?  Absolutely not.  Most *healthy* humans simply eat a well-rounded diet with snacks in moderation.   The reputable pet food manufacturers have done the research and provide all the nutrients a cat should have. <br>  <br>  Purina Kitten Chow for at least the first six-months is fine.<br>  <br>  I would, however, introduce wt kitten food as a treat a few times a week, but that is just so that she gets used to eating wet food.|`|AA10859773	It's best to have at least some wet food included in a cat's diet.  It's best if that's all it eats but I realize that's not possible for everyone.  So if you want or need to feed some dry food as well that's ok.<br>  <br>  The "other" cat food nazi's would have you believe that they know what they're talking about, but sadly they do not.  And unfortunately they have enough skills to sound plausible, even though they never provide sources for their statements.  They just parrot what they've heard and never question the "facts."<br>  <br>  Feed as much canned food as you can afford to.  You can go half and half - one dry meal and one wet meal, or you can serve a little of both at each meal - but in separate bowls.<br>  <br>  As for kitten food, that's honestly not important either, but that wasn't your question so I won't go on about it.  It's just that when I see these obvious fallacies I feel compelled to clean up after them.  Much like dog poo on the sidewalk.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your kitty needs to eat wet food.  Dry food has been linked to feline diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. I used to feed dry to my cats till one of them went into kidney failure.

YVen9Hdkaa	Puppy should not be exposed to the outside world until he has all his series of shots.<br>  <br>  You can leash train her in the house so she gets used to wearing it.  You can take her for "walks" around inside the house, but not outside till the vet says it's okay.  Make sure putting on the collar or harness is a happy fun experience for your puppy.  Use treats and lots of praise.<br>  <br>  Puppies have so much energy just being puppies and playing like crazy, that they get plenty of exercise.  They don't need to go on walks for exercise.<br>  <br>  Teach him to go on the paper or puddle pad, or in the yard if it's fenced and no other dogs go in there.  After all her shots are complete, she will love to explore the world and go on walks with you, and be part of your "pack".|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	leash training should start as soon as you get the dog and he's had a chance to settle in (a day or two) <br>  <br>  it's not adviseable to take a young puppy to a dog park or another area where lots of strange dogs are, because of chance of illness.... but you can ask your vet how old the pup needs to be, and what shots it has to have before it can be exposed to high dog traffic areas.<br>  <br>  once he can be around other dogs, you would be doing him a big favor by socializing him as many times a week as you can, so he gets used to strange dogs and people.  if you can do this, he won't be a yappy barker when he sees strangers and other dogs, because he will have become accustom to them at a young age.<br>  <br>  take care and if you need training information you can find a lot of good websites by doing a search for Training A Puppy.  There will be numerous websites and i'm sure you will find a lot of great help!|`|c5eeba4eae0b989e5215d3cd6ec48329aa	I would wait until the puppy is fully vaccinated (usually 16 weeks).|`|AA11089301	the sooner the better, start early so they will get leash trained alot easier than an older dog.|`|WOvXaGUYaa	Yes, the puppy can be taken on walks from when you get it. However the walks would have to be rather short, just judge when he/she is getting tired and that's enough. <br>  Puppies need the exercise and socialization early so they can start building their confidence.<br>  Start tomorrow!!|`|cO5m6Eqnaa	Needs to have its injections first, then should be ok and you'll soon see when its had enough. Start short and build up gently. Don't overwalk it as its muscles are still forming, especially in the back legs.|`|XoAavDz8aa	Once the puppy has had it's Parvo vaccinations it's safe.  Otherwise stick to the backyard.|`|Pnh6Vlzyaa	Early as possible. Puppies need to get some leg muscle as early as they can. Just bring a bag with you when you go or carry her in case she get's tired.|`|hOZtBiTSaa	the best age that a puppy should be taken for walk is for about 8-10 days old..|`|5PsKGss7aa	Normally its when the vet says its all right to start taking the puppy on walks after a certain amount of shots are obtained.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  DEFINITELY not what mary said about 8-10 days old.|`|m8QfHC7uaa	You should start training him right off with a leash and signals. It might take time for him to get use to it, but be patient...they have unconditional love for you if you treat them right with respect and love.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Sometimes it takes a week or so for a dragon to settle down or settle into his new home. Try to keep handling to a minimum for about a week.  They go through a stress period when you bring them home They have a lot of new things to deal with, the coming home and the new home you have placed him in. Just be sure that your temperatures are correct especially in the basking area and give him a week to settle in. If it continues after that take him to the vet as he may have some parasites that need to be taken care of which is fairly normal. Continue to feed him his crickets or super worms as well as a fresh daily salad. I am also giving you my list of what to feed daily, occasionally and never foods to help you.

Be sure to take in a stool sample or else the vet will make you come back and spend more money.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jTeDpBjlaa	Where did he get the dragon? Was it checked by a vet? <br>  <br>  It is difficult to tell if a reptile is healthy, simply by how they look. <br>  <br>  However, stress from the move COULD be the reason.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you take the dragon to the vet for an initial "wellness" visit, just to be safe!|`|oZXc84tjaa	I am just the same now! I was fine on sunday but on monday it was awful....<br>  Its nothing to worry about.<br>  Usually, it only lasts 12-24 hours, so there is nothing to worry about.<br>  If you are really concerned, I suggest phoning or taking him to the doctor.|`|7ruIhZKaaa	If It Has the Squits He Will Die Momentarily...|`|alAtUXvyaa	what?|`|G12K7E0Yaa	if the odor isn't too strong he could be over hydrating.  if it stinks real bad get him to the vet to get a script of albon, antibiotics for reptiles, be sure to take the vet a nice gift, i nice beardie stool sample to scope for parasites.
taLD45Sqaa	It depends on your litter. If you are using a clay litter you need to switch to something else ASAP. It can clump up and block their intestines or stay in their stomach and can be fatal (especially the kind made to clump.) I switched to the wood pellet kind when I got my pups, it turns into sawdust and would be easier to pass if eaten. It's cheap to and smells nice like trees. You can also get recycled paper litter or crystal litter. These are more expensive and I have not tried these before. Have fun with your pup and try to teach him that cat poop is not food!!|`|pTYbhKf5aa	Dogs love "cat cookies" from the litter box. It's a disgusting habit, but makers of litter boxes have invented a top entry litter box that dogs can't get into.  Check with your local Pet Store, like a PetSmart or PetCo which carry wide varieties of pet supplies, or check on line. It's worth the price to stop the litter raiding.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Yes your puppy can get sick from this.  Why don't you put the kitty litter box where the dog can't get to it?  That would be a lot cheaper and less stressful than having your puppy go through surgery for an obstruction.|`|uZ8mIhJ1aa	If its the natural kitty litter that's flushable no it'll be fine but if its the rocks then animal can't digest them and it builds up in there stomach and digestive track.|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	Unfortunately my dog also does this.....He did it as a puppy when I would take him to visit with my family and they had a cat.  Over the years he has been around no cats until I recently got one.  He did it again.  I ended up having to put up a baby gate so he couldn't get into the room where the cat litter box is.  If you don't block off the room its in your gonna be busy cleaning up the aftermath ( throw-up).  And trust me... it s 10 times worse when your dog has ingested it then expels it.  Yes they can get very sick from the chemicals in cat urine and feces let alone the products used to make the cat litter.  good luck......|`|AA11457471	Yep- it can be deadly!<br>  Not to mention that your cat won't appreciate being pestered while in the box.<br>  I put a low, easy open baby gate in the doorway. Problem solved!|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Yes, he can get sick.  Put the litter where the dog can't get to it!
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	That reminds me of my cat. Whenever someone is under a blanket, he paws at them until the person makes a tent out of the blanket for him to go under. He loves cozy, dark little places.<br>  <br>  All dogs are different; they all have their individual preferences. Some Miniature Pinschers will love playing in the snow and others will love cuddling in the warmest place available. You just happen to have a cuddlebug.<br>  <br>  Most tiny, single-coated breeds like Miniature Pinschers, Italian Greyhound and Chihuahuas do tend to prefer warm places, though. They're so small with such little insulation and such. That's a large reason for why so many people put sweaters on their shivery little dogs.<br>  <br>  You can't choose Best Answer until four hours have passed after you've asked the question.

And if I didn't let her sleep with me it would break her heart.   A lot of the small, short haired dogs like rat terriers and chihuahuas like to be covered up also.  So, to answer your question, you have a perfectly normal MinPin.  Enjoy him!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Some dogs like to be under a blanket & some don't.

Kdph0XLXaa	There are so many behavioral issues involving impoper litterbox use. is the box big enough? Have you changed anything about it? Where is it located? Maybe the cat doesn't like the litter you use. <br>  Whatever it is, something is wrong and this is how she is telling you. <br>  I suggest you look for a book called "Think Like a Cat: How to Raise a Well-Adjusted Cat, Not a Sour Puss" by Pam Johnson-Bennett. I bought this book a few years ago because my cat (same age as yours) was having litterbox issues. Turned out she wanted a bigger box in a more ouf the way spot. We worked it out thanks to this book & have had no more problems. Good luck to you both.|`|G1W1l6u4aa	Cats can be very picky about their litter boxes and it's hard to nail down just what they are looking for.  I would try experimenting with different boxes, litters, and placements.<br>  <br>  It's not uncommon for cats to begin to show inappropriate litter box behaviours after a UTI.  Sometimes the cat will associate the litter box, litter, or even the physical location with the pain that they felt during the infection.  After one of my cats had a UTI I had to stop using a particular brand of litter, she refused to go near the litter box when it was filled with that brand.<br>  <br>  Try using a deeper litter box, or try using a box with a top.  Also, make sure that you are scooping the litter box at least daily so that it is very clean for her.|`|tPHfsRemaa	U should very gentally take ur cat and just put her in her litter box...gentlly take her paw and let her feel the sand in the litter box, as corny as it sounds let her and the liter box become one...i promis that will do it m an expert wit cats...good luck.."")|`|WchGezIAaa	My solution?<br>  sell it to your local Chinese restaurant. I'm sure she would make killer dumplings.<br>  <br>  stupid cats~ *mumble* think they can do whatever they want~~~|`|NmLMUOkXaa	Well if the vet says she's fine, maybe get a litter box with a top. At least she knows where her box is lol my cat seems to have forgotten.
49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I'd say you deserve a dog; you have done your homework, have made plans, and have researched carefully.  If everyone were as careful and thoughtful about their choice of pets as you, there might not be any need for shelters. <br>  <br>  Good luck - I'm pulling for you!!!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Why do you want another dog when you already have one?  What happened to wanting and caring for that dog?  Sorry but your dad was a lot nicer then most dad would have been and got you the first dog, don't expect him to get you another one.  You have already saved one animal by getting the first dog, so just love him and play with him, and be responsible for him.|`|aQrURNqHaa	Show him how responsible you are with your pet and tell him the reason you want another.  If you are sincere and show him that you are capable of taking care of your pets, then it will be easier for him to let you have another.  You should also show him the research you've done and your plans so he can see how serious you are.  And don't forget to mention all the positive experiences you've had with your current dog. Good Luck!|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Although the thought is nice, if he says no, you'll have to wait until you're moved out to start rescuing dogs. It's his house, so he makes the rules. <br>  <br>  I'd start, though, by proving how responsible you are with the first one. Do you feed it without being asked, every single day? Do you clean up after it's messes? Have you trained it? Do you walk it? Do you pay the vet bills or buy the food? <br>  <br>  If he sees that you are the primary caretaker for the first dog, he may say yes to another. However, he still may say no, because another concern for parents is that their children will not take the dog when they leave. After all, it's hard to move with a pet!|`|bJh1MesQaa	Well just slip the information by his bed. Maybe do some extra work around the house without telling him the reason.

meMF69tXaa	Thumping is a behavior out in the wild to warn other rabbits of danger. You will have to evaluate the noises around you to see what is triggering your bun to act in such a way. It could be anything from a dog barking, the television, the dryer - anything. It's hard to say why he/she is grunting. <br>  <br>  Also, your rabbit has to have time to adjust to the new surroundings. He/she has been traumatized by the stay in the pound. Just give your rabbit a little time to adjust. If your rabbit has not been altered, you will want to consider doing that to cut down on aggressive behavior. <br>  <br>  I know that it's alot to take in right now because you are confused about the behavior in your rabbit. However, just try to be patient and work with your rabbit on a daily basis. He/she can turn around in no time with a little help. And remember that all rabbits have different personalities. Rabbits don't always like to be held or cuddled.<br>  <br>  Just a few pointers for you if you are new to rabbit ownership: <br>  <br>  -Housing for your rabbit is very important. Please, do not use any wood based bedding because it is not good for rabbits.<br>  <br>  -Give your rabbit good quality pellets, lots of Timothy hay, and learn what veggies are treats are good and which ones are bad. (lettuce and cabbage are not recommended, limit the amount of sweet treats you give) Give your rabbit fresh water daily.<br>  <br>  -You can use many things for toys for your rabbit to keep him/her occupied. My rabbits love those logs that you can purchase at Wal-Mart in the animal  section. They love to run through them, sleep in them and chew on them. Cardboard boxes with holes cut in them as well as toilet paper rolls (without the toilet paper) stuffed with hay will keep them occupied. You can also purchase those jingle balls (I use the ones that do not have holes in them) for your rabbit to play with.<br>  <br>  -Do not bathe your rabbit. I have seen many post on this subject on here and as I have said before, rabbits are self cleaning animals who do not require baths. Baths can cause hypothermia and shock to rabbits.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, always support your rabbit's hind quarters and back while holding him/her. Approach your rabbit in a gentle manner because sudden movements can frighten rabbits. Speak to your rabbit in a soft voice.<br>  <br>  Welcome to rabbit ownership! I hope that you enjoy your rabbit! Best wishes.......|`|yYeNejwUaa	He is sizing you up. Often when a rabbit gets the taste of flesh it starts to crave it. Very likely, a mouse climbed into your rabbits cage and your rabbit killed it and ate it. Now it has the hunger for a bigger hunt, and a larger quantity of flesh. I would reinforce the cage and put a bigger lock on the cage. Use the buddy system whenever you go into the room with the rabbit and NEVER let it out of the cage again. The best option would be to skin him naked and show him who is the boss. That would make him look at you as a god instead of food.|`|puMZ0bgmaa	It's hard to say whether the bun will warm up to you or not, as it is an adult.  Generally, holland lops are incredibly friendly and love to cuddle and kiss.  Thumping is a fear response to let other rabbits know something is wrong - my lop thumped at my new puppy for almost an entire week.  Try handfeeding him veggies such as parsley, carrot tops, lettuce (not iceberg), apples, or a small piece of banana.  Not only will he learn that the food comes from you, but handfeeding also helps create a bond.  If you notice he is snorting a lot, make quiet movements and pet him on the back of the neck.  Slowly work your hand up to between his eyes.  My lop loves having his cheeks rubbed, and purrs (clicking sound) when I do it - just remember buns need lots of time, attention, and love.|`|AA10060479	He wants to play and he was made to breed so if they snipped his boys he might react this way or if his used to been petted and he hasn't been he'll get fussy.

I've never heard of a bed bug problem, but I'm sure the flea stuff the groomer uses is potent enough to kill other bugs also.|`|i41tUVtIaa	They will need to be dipped professionally.  When you get your beds moved put each leg in a glass jar.  The bedbugs can't climb on glass and will not be able to get into your bed.
R7jkSmNqaa	For substrate, any would do just so long as they do not compact easily when under water because this would prevent root growth. In the aquarium, most plants use roots simply to anchor themselves and prevent themselves from being taken away by the current rather than absorb nutrients. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you try Java moss. Since you have a rather limited aquarium space, big plants would barely be adequate. Java moss is easy to care for and would carpet your aquarium with greenery in no time. Most people report that dropping a java moss in water is all that is needed (since it sinks to the bottom and has no real roots of its own) and it will grow profusely by itself (given that extreme water parameters are avoided)<br>  <br>  Java Fern is also a good candidate since it is a hardy plant but they can grow quite large.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	You can find all the answers about fish keeping and aquarium maintenance on fish plenty|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I use Flourite in my planted aquarium.

QLWPvFmuaa	I am not sure that you can.  I had a spayed malamute mix, who was a terrific dog, but the only way we kept her home was to build a kennel for her.  We tried an electric dog fence - the kind you bury a wire around the yard and the dog wears a collar that will deliver a small shock if the dog gets too close to it.  We did all the training so she would know where the boundary was and she was very quick to figure it out and cheerfully avoided the white flags we used to train her.  And equally cheerfully closed her eyes and bolted through the boundary to greet me when I came home.  Ergo, the 12' x 12' kennel with a lid. It took her about two minutes to climb over the top the first time we put her in it.  Malamutes require a lot of exercise to be happy, so if you kennel your dog, be sure he/she gets lots of time outside to run off all that energy.  Left to her own devices, she had about a 22 block range.  Good luck|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Why don't you just fence in a small portion of it?

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	He's just a baby. It often takes a few months for housebreaking to be effective. Some dogs catch on very quickly, and others don't. There's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  Remember, he has very little control over his bladder and bowels at this point. He isn't even three months old yet. You must take him out very often to give him many opportunities to relieve himself.<br>  <br>  Watch him like a hawk to prevent any accidents in the house. The moment you see the telltale signs (sniffing, circling, agitation, whatever signs he usually shows), immediately scoop him up and bring him outside.<br>  <br>  When you bring him out, bring him out on a leash so that he can't go off and play. Bring him to the designated "potty area" and simply wait for him to go. It may take awhile, so if it's cold where you are, make sure you put your coat on first. The second he goes, throw a party. Tons of treats - don't skimp! You'd be much more willing to do what someone wanted if they offered $20 instead of $1, wouldn't you? Give him at least ten tiny, delicious treats like chicken, cheese, hot dog or whatever is his favorite. Praise him like crazy, cuddle him, pet him. If he wants to play, now you can let him off the leash and reward him by playing and having fun. You have to make pottying outside worthwhile, so offer a hefty reward.|`|4Z5GPuORaa	Don't compare the two little fellows..............don't lose your patience......... he is taking time but will learn definitely.........|`|d04x3IaWaa	Well, firstly... what kind of pups are they?<br>  <br>  Large breed dogs take to potty training quicker and better than small breed dogs.  Don't be surprised if you have a 6 month old small breed that still isn't potty trained.  My males have also always taken longer than my females and I've potty trained more darn puppies in the past 6 years than most will ever train lol.   (I'm a foster parent with a local animal rescue)<br>  <br>  Make sure you have scheduled feeding times.  Whenever youre home, leave the water down but make sure you know when they drink. Take them outside about 5-10 minutes after eating/drinking.  Have your male watch your female, and when you praise her and treat her, his jealousy might just encourage him to do the same :)  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|puMZ0bgmaa	I have my girl (also 11 wks) pretty much trained now, and I never used a treat or bell.<br>  I just take her outside after she eats and drinks, and immediately after we're done playing, before we go to bed/nap and first thing after she wakes up.  Yes, you might feel like you're outside a lot, but it will pay off in the end.  My girl also barks and cries when she has to poop, which gives us a great clue that she needs to go.<br>  Also, keep in mind that once you start housebreaking, you cannot really lay down pee pads for the pups.  Encouraging to go outside, then inside, then outside again can confuse your pup.<br>  Don't worry and stay with it, in a few days she'll be a pro!|`|75ea01aac44d3829e0335f8ce5efb490aa	I potty trained my basset hound very easily by using the bell trick<br>  <br>  what i did was hang bells near the door and everytime it looked like he had to go to the bathroom id do the whole "u gotta go potty" thing and then take his bells and ring them and make sure he rings them with his head too <br>  <br>  eventually he'll figure out that the noise means that you'll take him out and he'll ring them on his own<br>  <br>  my dog has never had a problem potty training with that method he never had a accident in the house and hes realllly stubborn|`|Skdto464aa	you can try taking him outside whenever he starts sniffing around

X2bxkU2paa	small to med and you want a husky?  Research the breed of whatever you plan on getting.<br>  <br>  You should adopt a dog from your local shelter before going out a buying a purebred from a breeder.<br>  <br>  If you want to know of an excellent breed for cuddling that are med sized, light shedders, do not have a very high exercise requirement,  and absolutely love people, get a pit bull.  Seriously, they are the most affectionate breed of dog I've ever seen before, and they are relentless snuggle bugs.  Don't believe the hype of them being mean or vicious, it's all how you raise them, that goes for any breed of dog or mix thereof.  All dogs are good at heart, they just need proper guidance from their owners.  <br>  <br>  But pit bulls were actually bred to be family companions and to be really friendly towards people.  I'll explain why.<br>  <br>  The Pit Bull served as a small game hunter when it became the American Pit Bull Terrier, or was brought to America during colonial times.  It was then bred to serve that purpose and to continue serving its purpose as a family companion.  The reason Pit Bulls prior to this were used as family companions, among other things, was because breeders who bred them for pit activities (typically in rat pits) and other underground animal combat activities, wanted a dog that was extremely driven to attack the other animal(s).  But a dog that was so driven and in an attack state of mind that couldn't differentiate what it was supposed to bite from its handler wasn't valued as a dog showing a good trait for the breed.  This trait was culled out, which led the way for the ancient pit bulls, as a breed, to be extremely affectionate, gentle, and sociable with human beings.  So, although they had a bad, aggressive history regarding their implementations as a breed, as a result from this, they acquired an aptitude for being friendly and affectionate family dogs.  <br>  <br>  The real truth is, the whole dog fighting aspect of the American Pit Bull Terrier is just an exploit of dog fighters who saw the athleticism, drive and tenacity of the breed as being beneficial in dog fighting.  Pit bulls were never bred to be dog fighters, although dogs they are thought to have come from were, but these dogs were not actual pit bulls and didn't look a lot like pit bulls either.  In fact, the genes associated with peer aggression have been inadvertently supressed in the majority of pit bulls in existence today, ever since dog fighting lost its popularity 100's of years ago.  They do, however, still possess the drive to hunt and kill other animals, but the natural instinct of all dogs to preserve their own species and develop packs supersedes any canine aggression that their predecessors were bred to possess.  And most dogs have a drive to hunt, this is due to the fact that they have, via humans, artificially evolved from wild predators - that being wolves.  <br>  <br>  Get a pit bull, it's extremely hard for them to find good homes and you'll be saving a life if you adopt one from a shelter.  You'll love him/her, but they will love you even more!  I promise you that.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Dogs on the sofa<br>  Why do dogs tend to sleep on the sofa, your favourite chair or even sleep on your bed? They seem to love these places and often climb onto them repeatedly even when we repeatedly ask them to get down. <br>  <br>  True enough, sofas, chairs and other furniture are extremely comfortable and that's one reason why dogs like to hang out on them. Another key reason often has to do with dominance. Before dogs became domesticated, the alpha dog, or leader of the pack, would always choose a high sleeping ground as the choice place to sleep. Feral or wild dogs in packs as well as wolves still sleep in this way. The highest ranking member of the pack sleeps at a level that is physically higher than the other members of the pack. This hierarchical nature of the pack is hardwired in modern dogs as well. By letting your dog sleep on furniture that is higher than the ground (the same places you relax and sleep on) you are quite possibly communicating to him/her that he/she is your equal. You may even be communicating that your dog is more dominant than you. This is especially true if your dog regularly exhibits other dominant behaviour and it has the potential to escalate into a real problem, including aggression. These other dominant behaviours include growling at you, leaning on you, eating food before the human family, entering or leaving doorways before you and generally not listening to you etc. A dog that KNOWS that every member of the family is higher in rank, will generally not exhibit these behaviours. <br>  <br>  It is therefore good practice, not to allow your dog access to these high sleeping grounds (or high relaxation grounds) in order to assure your position as the leader of the pack. If you are not home and the dog has access to these higher places for resting, than placing certain objects that dogs dislike on the couch or chair in question is a great idea. There are plastic items in most pet stores that have blunt plastic spikes on them that are perfect for this situation. If the dog jumps on the couch or chair, it lands on the blunt spikes which don't hurt the dog but make it uncomfortable for the dog to lie on. <br>  <br>  It is best that the dog's place of relaxation and sleep be a comfy blanket or basket on the floor. This will prevent possible behavioral problems associated with dominance. As always, all dogs should have basic obedience training and dominance issues should be discussed with your veterinarian or trainer<br>  <br>  The ultimate decision of the breed is up to your parents since your under the age of 18,<br>  <br>  Husky are NOT bed dogs-They will be chewing your bed to pieces!

AA11708471	your tank is only just just just big enough for your betta<br>  <br>  and betta need filters and heaters|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	bettas, at ALL TIMES, should be kept in isolation. they are fighting fish, and you run the risk of the little one murdering the new addition.|`|O1VcREmJaa	No. Usually people will tell you not to mix Betta's with anything anyway. However, if you did decide to get a filter I would suggest an under gravel filter. It will not harm your betta. In fact it will cut down maintenance because you wont have to change the water as frequently. Either way however even if you had one you'd also need a heater or a very warm house. Without those things nothing would survive. With those things you could get one fish such as a neon tetra, possibly a danio, or something else smaller than a betta without a fancy tail. As long as it in no way resembles the betta and isn't overly colorful and is smaller than the betta it should leave it alone.|`|qDvzOjhxaa	While I don't recommend keeping a betta in a 2.5 gallon tank, I will recommend 'White Cloud tetras'. They don't fin nip, they don't attack other fish, and they're constantly moving.

735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	It is hard to say how a non-related horse will act with a foal. Many geldings are indifferent, but some are very interested "uncles" that help raise the foal.  I have always kept my mare and foal away from the he others for about four months. It depends entirely on the individual horses, though.<br>  I got scared after having my mare with my friend' mare. The other mare foaled first by a week.  I waited a few days and put the mares and foals together and the other mare tried to kill my mare's foal with her hooves!  I didn't want any problem like that again.  If there were just the mare and the gelding and they are good friends, chances are excellent that the gelding will be fond of the foal. It is so important to make sure that is how he feels and that the mare isn't over protective and wanting to get the gelding away.  Horses are individuals and we have to respect that.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Geldings are known for hurting babies, it's just in their nature (it's the male thing).  Some will and some won't.

Are you positive on his age?<br>  <br>  As for the pups being too large for her, its more the number of pups than the size of the father that determines each pups size at birth.  If a female of a breed that usually have large numbers of pups, has only one pup, she will usually need a C-section to have it.  I'm not sure what is the normal litter size for the Shar Pei.<br>  <br>  You're probably safe for this heat, if the pup really is only three months.  <br>  <br>  If you plan to neuter him, make sure to wait until his long bone growth has finished at least.  Interrupting hormones from the testes, they don't only produce testosterone, will often cause inconsistencies in growth hormone release by the pituitary gland.  The endocrine system is interconnected.  To ensure the correct amount and timing of growth hormone is available, wait until full growth is reached, or at least the completion of the long bone growth.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	She does have to be 'in heat' to get pregnant.<br>  Most females will not allow a dog to attempt to mount her unless she is ready...she will be agressive with him when he tries until she is actually in heat and ready.<br>  <br>  not sure if the large pups would hurt her or not...possibly could harm her or the pups themselves during labor, their heads could become stuck or anything. I would talk to the vet about it (if she becomes pregnant) and see if he thinks a C-section would be safer--but know that the bill will be HIGH.<br>  <br>  I suggest putting her in a kennel for the 21 days or so that she is in heat, or take her to a friend or family member's that can keep her away from male dogs.

AM7CgQ4daa	Firstly, if you are not capable of spending time and money on the pup, return it to your friend, for dogs live between 10 and 18 years, so this is a huge responsibility.<br>  Your dog will need the shots required in your country of origin, normally distemper and pavo, america needs rabies,  some countries need heart worm tablets or yearly needle, plus regular worming tables and vet visits when dogs get sick - which happens.<br>  You will need a bed,  somewhere safe to keep the puppy if you are not home,  puppy food, , toys, leash, collar, treats, , brushes, shampoo water and food bowls.   Shelter and good fences if the dog will spend time outside.<br>  The papers I assume they are talking about would be kennel dog papers for a pure breed dog, or perhaps they are talking about his immunization records, as he should already have had his first shots.<br>  Look over your house, make sure all electrical cords can not be reached by the pup, and that no poisons are left about, puppies chew anything and everything.   It often helps to crawl about on the floor so you can see what the puppy can see, you have to puppy proof your house.<br>  I have supplied some websites for additional info, the last one has information on the first night at home and what to expect.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Vet bills don't come cheap... but your puppy needs to have all its shots.  The vet can let you know what these are.  You might do well to call and let them  know you've never had a dog before, and ask them what the cost will be so you are prepared.<br>  <br>  Papers are for purebred registered dogs.  They aren't important, unless you are showing or breeding.  But i would recommend getting any dog you have spayed or neutered.  There are already millions of unwanted dogs in the world (even those who someone has paid a lot of money for but gave up).<br>  <br>  Your dog needs to start training as soon as you and he are comfortable together - usually in a day or two; however i'm sure you know housebreaking starts immediately. <br>  <br>  Puppies need to realize you are the leader, they are not.  Training takes patience and a calm but firm trainer/leader. <br>  <br>  Give your puppy treats as it learns new things and as it does as you have asked.  Treats should be reserved for an obedient dog.  <br>  <br>  Puppies need to be socialized with other dogs and people (only when the vet says it's had all its puppy shots and it can be around strange dogs-- just ask the vet).  Unsocialized dogs tend to be yappy and sometimes fearful.  So getting the dog out for exercise is great for their social skills as well as daily exercise.<br>  <br>  Dogs which do not get adequate exercise can get into mischief -- digging holes, chewing up carpets and other things, etc.  If you see to it your dog has a good play or run for at least an hour a day, he or she will be happier.  <br>  <br>  Chew toys (never rawhide of any kind) are important.  <br>  <br>  You can find  loads of information about puppies and their care on the internet.  There are many free websites for help and advice.  You can do a search for<br>  <br>  Housebreaking a Puppy<br>  Training a Puppy<br>  Leash Training a Puppy<br>  <br>  I think the first thing you need to decide is whether you want to take on this responsibility or not.  take care and enjoy!|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Well it sounds as if your friend should have given you a warning before he gave you the puppy, as it sounds like you don't have a clue about dogs!<br>  Anyways papers.  Means that both of puppies parents were AKC Registered.  So if the dog had papers it would mean that it is a purebred dog.  And Registered with the AKC.  Did your friend give you any papers?  <br>  The puppy will need a series of 3 sets of shots.  Rabies, parvo are a few of them.  Call a Vet in your area.  And make an appointment.  You can ask how much it will cost, and what shots the dog will need.<br>  <br>  You will want to have the dog checked out by the Vet.  To make sure he is healthy also.  <br>  <br>  Dogs defiantly aren't cheap.  Shots, Vet visits in case the dog gets sick, grooming appointments, flea/tick preventive, heart worm preventive, food, toys, etc.  <br>  <br>  You also have to exercise and train it.  <br>  <br>  You know what, just e-mail me if you have any more questions.|`|AA11089301	give him a bath in baby shampoo....it kills flees dead, take him to the vet soon for shots and worming it will be around 50 bucks, buy some toys and chew bones, science diet pet food the amount depends on what kind of dog it is and how big it is, ask the vet. i dont know what kind of papers you are talking about unless its a full blooded dog and you get papers on it in the mail, but your friend should have those for you to send off, or maybe your talkin about doggy papers for them to pee on, they have those at wal-mart.
PUiPeJqVaa	Get your dad a new house and let him stay in there for the rest of his life while you live in your own house with your dog... get that?|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	continue to show responsibility--one way is to try to find a job so you can pay for dog food and vet care. Offer to get a puppy and make sure dad knows you will be 100 % responsible for these things as well as walking the pup every day in good weather and bad. Good luck.|`|qPdAJqKJaa	Are you really sure you are ready to get a dog? If your not working how will you afford vaccinations, food, grooming, and any unexpected vet bills, that can run into the thousands? Dogs live for around 15 years, you are only young. Im sure you wont live with your dad forever, what about when you move out? Will the rental accomodation allow you to have a dog? What if you travel, or can only afford a flat. One of the main reasons dogs are surrendered where i work is because the owners are moving to a rental and cant have pets. What if you start working? Who will care for the dog during the day and train it? Dog ownership is a lot different to cat and other small animal ownership. Im sure thats why your father doesnt want you to get one, he has seen a lot more than you as he is older.<br>  Have you considered volunteering at a shelter if your not working? You could spend time with the dogs without the financial or long term responsibility. Have you considered fostering? Most shelters are desperate for people to foster their dogs, and puppies and kittens that are too young to be homed.<br>  Im sure you would be a great owner, but perhaps try fostering first if you want?
W02kTOqmaa	I dunno, I would personally find it kind of disrespectful. That is a place of rest and remembrance and mourning. Are there any large parks near you instead? I mean, dogs will be dogs, and that includings running and playing and yes, pooping, and those just don't seem like respectful acts to me in a graveyard. I would NEVER do it. just my personal opinion. A graveyard is just that, a graveyard, not a park.<br>  <br>  BUT, at the same time, if I saw someone walking their dog through a graveyard, as long as the dog wasn't misbehaving, I wouldn't judge them for it. It's just something I myself would never think of doing.|`|kRO55DHyaa	You'll want to check with the rules of the cemetary first, and maybe city ordinances.  I am guessing that you could be fined in many places for walking your dog there, as I don't know of any cemetary that doesn't have a big 'no dogs' sign at the entrance.  Families just don't want to step on dog poop when visiting gravesites.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Check out if you are allowed to walk your dog there.<br>  <br>  When I inhabit a graveyard I hope dogs will visit me.  I believe dogs are all knowing, spiritual creatures and have a pure innocence that totally escapes human beings.  Your dog would be welcome at my graveside.<br>  <br>  You should always pick up after your dog, no matter where he poops. Not just in a graveyard.|`|L22hVXTIaa	I don't think it's disrespectful - just stay off the graves.

I have one dog that drinks from the bottom of the bucket so his whole face gets wet and one that forgets to swall and then walks away from the bucket dripping water. I haven't had much luck fixing the problem. Although I will say that one thing that seems to help a little is to have a deep bucket instead of a shallow dispenser. I have a 5 gallon bucket instead of a water bowl. It's much deeper than the bowl of the LeBistro dispenser.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Deep, gusty sigh, I know just what you mean.<br>  <br>  See what a messy drinker my male Dobermann JJ is!<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallonbrooke/3290279075/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallonbrook...</a><br>  <br>  Tried a large tray, but didn't work for my two as they would have a drink look around, spilling water/goats milk or walk away dripping.

AoSeHXeQaa	An older (well behaved) dog will serve as a good role model for a young dog. And its natural for a dog to poop and pee where it smells another dog, which makes potty training easier.<br>  <br>  When I bring home a foster dog, I always make EVERYONE go outside together at set times.  When my dogs go, the new dog(s) will usually go, too.|`|vJg5k342aa	Keep in mind that while puppies may pick up good behaviors, they'll also learn any bad habits an older dog may have.  Having an older dog to mentor a younger one is only helpful if the older dog is well trained and under control.<br>  <br>  If I had to break it down into numbers, I'd say a puppy ultimately learns behavior through 45% temperament, 45% training and 10% observation of other dogs.|`|rseD4OG2aa	That is totally correct. I have two golden retrievers and the older one is nine years old (his name is Cash). We've had him since he was a puppy and almost two years ago now we got Krypto to keep him company. Krypto was just a few weeks old when he first brought him home and having Cash around has really helped him. <br>  Teaching Krypto not to go to the bathroom in the house was easy, it was difficult with Cash, and just general good behavior was much easier to learn for Krypto then it was for Cash. Now, because Cash is so mature today, he's really calmed down from when he was a puppy, and I think that's rubbed off on Krypto, although he can still be nuts sometimes.|`|wIOf22wRaa	Yes it is a possibility, sometimes animals copy each other too, it is a psychological thing. But, it depends on how aggressive the older dog is. You don't want the puppy copying his bad habits either.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	I believe so because my friend had her pup trained immediately just by putting her out with her other dog. They see the other dog and follow suit. I think as long as the original dog is well behaved and well trained, it'll be a benefit.|`|FZCKqZkpaa	Yes absolutely!!! My dog was nearly 2 when i bought my puppy. He was really well behaved and it sure rubbed off on my puppy :) puppies will copy the older dog...when they see the older dog toileting outside, they will want to aswell....8 years on...sadly my older dog passed away but now my grown up puppy is an angel :D|`|CJMhtM7maa	Yes a puppy will learn from the older dog.Not only potty training,but about rules of play,soft bites,etc.Our 5yr.old Pit Bull has helped train 3 other Pit pups,with house breaking,learning to heel,socializing.Even our cat has taught all of them how much play he will put up with.
KEYgd73saa	If you've got a fair bit of live rock and a decent filter, you shouldn't worry much about just pulling out all the substrate at once.  The only reason to do it in incroments is to allow the nitrogen fixing bacteria a chance to colonize the new substrate, but if you've plenty of live rock, this will happen anyways.  As for adding the new sand: go slowly.  Turn off/ the filter and any powerheads, and just scoop sand into the tank, gently setting it on the bottom-- do NOT dump it in from the surface.  Let it settle for about 10 minutes (the fish will be fine with the filter off for such a short time), and flip everything back on.
V7AAba8Laa	As the economy is in the tank and many people are struggling to keep up with bills, it is more practical to become a better educated pet owner to save on vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are always certain situations that require a vet, but EVERYONE should work to educate themselves about their particular type of pet and know what is normal, healthy behavior and what is not.  You can definitely save money by knowing what requires a vet and what does not.<br>  <br>  Particularly with livestock, if I had to call the vet everytime someone needed a shot, a hoof trim or was under the weather, I'd be flat broke all the time.  Many basic procedures, including vaccinations, deworming, hoof trimming, wing clipping and the diagnosis and treatment of minor illnesses can all be done with a little guidance from a trusted vet and a little experience and education on the part of the owner.<br>  <br>  My vet sees us about once a year, and it's typically for something major, such as a difficult delivery with one of the goats or sheep that I can't correct.  I'll often restock my medicine cabinet at that time.  My average yearly vet bill(s) total less than $300 for 3 dogs, 3 cats, 2 rabbits, 50+ chickens and about 15+ sheep and goats.<br>  <br>  There are many breed specific books and basic vet books for every type of pet there is.  A responsible owner will take their animal to the vet when it is necessary, but it is also more responsible to learn everything you can about the animals you have so that you can recognize what is normal and what is not.  Knowing your animal will keep the expensive "false alarm" vet visits to a minimum and save any pet owner money.<br>  <br>  And any cat or dog owner can (and should) take advantage of the low cost clinics that are offered through many chain pet stores.  $35 for a health exam and booster vaccines is a great deal and should be well within any owner's budget.  Many rescue organizations also offer low cost vaccines and spay/neuter clinics as well.<br>  <br>  If you want to save money on vet bills, educate yourself about your pet so you know when to call the vet!|`|DS21ekeJaa	If it was a choice between getting medical care for my child or for my pet, the child wins. <br>  I do love my dog and various other pets(all adopted or given to my by others that couldn't care for them)  and do what I can for them.

If you set a heater at 70 F, it will maintain a constant 70F, and will only turn on if it falls below.<br>  If you're saying that heaters don't go that low, then get a smaller heater than what is rated for your gallons level, and it won't go up too much.<br>  In general, 3 to 5 watts per gallon is recommended for all tropical fish.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about 70F being too high, tropical fish need about 75F to thrive.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Most heaters will keep the temperature at 70 F, if you set them for that temperature. The only exceptions are the ones that are pre-set at another temperature.<br>  <br>  Or do you mean one that will also cool the tank if your house is too warm? Such devices are available (they are called chillers, chillers/heaters, or heat exchangers), but they are quite expensive (hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the size of your tank).|`|h1zWBH4Uaa	just get a thermostatic heater. if you go to your pet store, talk to somone about heaters, then you will mention one witha thermostat, and get it. what it does is that it heats up to your water to 70 F, once your water gets to that temperature, it will turn off. and i am pretty sure it will cool your water if it goes over, but ask someone at the store just in case.|`|Iqdc8263aa	hmmm

They're still little and growing! :] <br>  <br>  I remember when I would feed my kitten milk from his bottle (I bought those cat bottles and cat milk at petsmart) and prepare his milk, play with him, caress him, and show him to his litter box. Kittens are so sweet and I believe you should give them as much as attention as you would give to a baby.|`|kGjnH34laa	Yes, kittens are babies because they are baby cats.|`|nzsBi6ZFaa	kittens are babies.  yours sounds really sweet and wonderful.|`|XpnnNLkOaa	They're both juveniles of the species.

uKOYK1Lvaa	Nope, total scam. They are regarded by their owners as simply not meeting standard, since the Australian Shepherd standard apparently is more lenient, however, if that were the case, why purposely breed smaller and give a "mini" name? Why not just accept you have a smaller-than-standard Australian Shepherd? Beyond me!<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell, what with all the scams out there, which breeds are actual breeds and which breeds actually exist. It's a good bet that just about any breed should be UKC or AKC registered (in America), Canadian KC for Canada.....I'm drawing a blank on Great Britian or Australia's Kennel Clubs, but I'm sure another user would know.<br>  <br>  Of course, not all breeds (especially rarer ones) are registered  with these registries, but there are some rules of thumb:<br>  1. Never buy/accept as a breed a dog that comes from a registry with "Hybrid" or "Designer" in the title. <br>  2. Never buy a dog breed with a "cutesy" name--such as "poo" or "doodle"<br>  3. It's usually a good idea not to trust Contentenital Kennel Club dogs either.<br>  4. Breeders should breed *breeds* for health, stability, standard, etc. They shouldn't be advertising "hypoallergenic", "never sheds", doesn't get above a certain height/weight/etc.<br>  5. There are actually only a handful of breeds recognized as "miniature", and terms like "toy", "tiny toy", "pocket", "teacup" in front of the breed are marketing points. <br>  And finally....<br>  6. Trust your gut. If you actually care about finding a good, un-scammed dog, you'll do just fine. Too many people turn a blind eye.<br>  <br>  Probably more than you're looking for, but I hope I helped :)|`|TBd9CeYeaa	i have heard of them <br>  <br>  but let me tell you sometime when someone tells you your dog is a miniature of another breed of dog they sometime sare wrong Australian shepherds is a real breed a miniature one i have no idea<br>  <br>  caue i own a collie aka lassie dog <br>  <br>  you will hear breeders calling their shelties a miniature collie but don't be fooled their is no such thing cause they are 100% a differnet breed and are not even collies just cause they look like them but are smaller doesn't mean they are <br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck|`|c15rWijuaa	They are not a breed. I have heard that people have bred down Aussie's and I have also heard that they just mixed dogs that look similar to them and they get a smaller version, but I am not sure in which way they created them (i.e whether they are mutts or really badly bred Aussies). <br>  <br>  Either way, I believe breeding them to be horrible. They are not thinking at all about function. Only size and that's not what breeding a dog is for. I don't see any reason out there for there to be Mini Aussie's other than people want smaller and smaller dogs and the dogs that already come small are not good enough.<br>  <br>  Sickens me really.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I personally think that they crossed Aussies with maybe Shelties to get the smaller size. It also would explain some of the temperaments.|`|FEPqgw4Daa	yes.... google|`|PM23RDycaa	They are considered mutts. The OFFICIAL Australian Shepherd breed clubs both in the US and the UKC do NOT recognize or condone the breeding of the mini or toy aussies. <br>  <br>  They are considered mutts because there has been no ounce of proof that they are 100% A.S. and just bred down versions.<br>  <br>  Breed standard in regards to Size<br>  Size, Proportion, Substance<br>  Size--The preferred height for males is 20-23 inches, females 18-21 inches.|`|bIaywrBCaa	no they are not a breed. Teacups, mini aussies, designer dogs, all scams. The only reason the breeders stay in business because of ignorant buyers who keep them busy selling their mutts.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Yes, Miniature Australian Shepherds are a breed. They are not an AKC recognized breed. (but then neither are APBTs to name one,  but no one suggests they aren't a breed) They have had their own breed club, Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of America, since 1996 (when they split from ASCA).  They register their own dogs & have shows. (not much different from ASCA there, only difference being Australian Shepherds can be dual registered with AKC, although not all of them are.) There are good Mini Aussie breeders out there that are breeding dogs from Registered Miniature Australian Shepherd lines. These breeders are concerned about breeding the best dogs that meet the breed standard & have earned their Championships. They do health testing. Some even work their dogs on stock or have them herding instinct tested. They are concerned about temperament. Everything a good breeder should do. The Mini Aussie is a fledgling breed. They aren't trying to be Australian Shepherds. But yes, there are bad breeders out there in this breed the same as there are in all breeds. Lots of BYB.

If the kitty is littered train there is no way you can train him/her to use the toilet. <br>  Slowly begin moving his litter box closer to the toilet. You may even want to slowly begin raising the level of the kitty box. You can do this by adding books or whatever underneath the litter box to make it higher. Just watch that the box doesn’t slide. Keep raising the level of the box until it is the same height as the toilet bowl. <br>  Get rid of the litter box completely. Place a metal mixing bowl the same width as your toilet bowl inside of it so it fits securely. Make sure you add plenty of litter to the bowl. Leave the lid that we women uses to sit on down for kitty.<br>  <br>  Now show kitty his/her new bowl. <br>  <br>  Kitty will wonder. If you can, place kitty on top of the toilet. Hopefully, he/she will start sniffing and recognize the smell of the litter and get the point. <br>  Place kitty onto the toilet. Show him/her how to position his/her feet. <br>  <br>  The first time he/she tries to use the bowl him/herself the feet position may not be correct. Let it go. But the next time, try to show him/her the proper stance.<br>  <br>  Praise kitty for getting onto the toilet. <br>  Slowly begin decreasing the amount of litter you put into the bowl. Be sure to empty the bowl as soon as kitty is finished. <br>  Once you get down to a tablespoon of water, begin adding water to the bowl. Kitty may not be happy. Start with a little water.<br>  <br>  If kitty is smart, he/she will realize that the water is helping to minimize the odor. He/she will like this fact.<br>  <br>  If Kitty stops using the bowl because of the water, take a break and go back to the small amount of litter without water for a few days and then try again. <br>  Slowly add more water, if kitty is comfortable. <br>  If you make it where the water is about three inches deep in the bowl, kitty may be ready to go without the bowl. Take away the bowl and see if Kitty still uses the toilet.<br>  <br>  If he does congratulations, you have toilet trained your cat. If he doesn’t, put the bowl back and try again in a few days. <br>  Tip and warnings for you:<br>  Do not teach your cat to flush. Although it is possible, once they learn they seem to enjoy it and will do it all the time. <br>  If you don't have a spare toilet, this is going to require much more effort, especially if there are other people living in the house. Everyone will have to move the litter holder each time they want to use the toilet and then put it back the way they found it. <br>  Cats can contract Toxoplasma Gondii and excrete it in their feces in the first 7-10 days of contracting the protozoa. It's not known whether wastewater treatment kills this parasitic protozoa, so if you live near the ocean with sea otters and you know your water treatment facility dumps into the ocean, it is recommended that you do not train your cat to use the toilet.<br>  Kittens like to bury their work so make sure you remove small items from the bathroom. Otherwise your stuffed toy shark may be found swimming in the bowl. <br>  <br>  If when you remove the "training box" the cat seems confused, try sprinkling a little flushable litter into the water to spark his or her memory.[1] <br>  Always, always, always wait until the cat is comfortable with a setup before changing it. Go slow. If you rush the cat, this will not work, and you are more likely to have accidents. Don't ever try to force a cat to do anything that it does not want to do. For example, you should never have to pick up the cat and put it in the litter box or on the "training box". If you must show or force a cat to do something, you've moved too quickly from one stage to the next. Go back to square one. <br>  This will not work with indoor/outdoor cats, as they will probably just learn to hold it rather than deal with this drama. <br>  This will work best if you are home full-time for the duration of the training time. <br>  Flush the toilet after your kitten urinates as some cats are shy to defecate onto urine. <br>  Try rewarding the kitten with treats after a successful toilet experience to reinforce a good job well done.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I would never do that to my cats. Cats have been doing the same thing for hundreds of years: digging and squatting. It is instinct to them--this is why many cats do not need to be litter trained at all. <br>  <br>  If you were to force your cat to make such a drastic change, it would be like someone telling you that you can never use a toilet again. Instead you have to use a litter box. That sounds ridiculous and unreasonable, right? Well your cat would certainly feel the same way about sitting on the toilet.<br>  <br>  Some people are successful in training their cat to use a toilet, but I think that it is very unnatural and even cruel. Doing so often leads to elimination problems. It may sound nice to not have to clean a litter box anymore, but how do you feel about cleaning cat pee off your toilet every day, and cleaning up other "presents" in your house?|`|vuMp8F7Daa	First off, you will need a litter tray and a bag of cat litter. Cat litter comes in the form of granules and is supplied in bags of varying sizes.  Fill the tray with these granules to about half way up the tray and when you find the cat doing it's business, put it (the cat) in the tray straight away.  Keep doing this whenever it is needed and the cat will soon learn.  This goes for puppies, too.  When the cat starts to do this on it's own, gradually move the tray and contents towards the outside door.  If you live in a house as opposed to a flat (apartment), encourage the cat to go outside to find the tray.  A small plastic shovel which has a grill moulded into it can be bought from the pet store.  Get this at the same time as the tray, litter etc.  Here comes the yukky part.  The cat "deposits" need to be taken out of the tray and this is where the shovel comes in.  Bag the poo off and dispose of it.    Over here, special bins are provided for dog poo, so you could put the stuff in these bins if your city has them.    Enjoy.|`|kGjnH34laa	I've never tried it but something that would probably work would be to get something to attach the litter box underneath the toilet seat.  Show it to the cat(s), then take it away after they use it for about a week.  Hope this helped!|`|063d52ce8540b5fb2b3be5fb92065043aa	this really only works if there kittens but take them to the box and take there paw and YOU scratch the litter a few times with there foot then close the door behind u leave them in there about an hour to let them know that that's what there supposed to do and for about a day and a half repeatedly do this through out the day that way they remember but don't leave them locked up that whole time they get mad give them luv so they know there not in trouble

uWA0D2zAaa	I have a huge 4 year old male golden (he's 130 lbs!) and a 5 month old female golden.  They are from the same parents and they are the best dogs we have ever had.  Jake (our male) isn't overweight, he's just a really huge dog for some reason, and he's AKC so it's not like he's a mix.  The vet was really surprised when we got him at 11 weeks, she told us he would be really big.  But he's such a love, and I swear he understands more human words than any other dog I've ever had.  Jessie (our 5 month old) is gorgeous, I've never seen such beautiful eyes on any dog, they are this light amber color that stands out against her golden coat.  <br>  <br>  Our dogs are our kids, and there is nothing like walking in the door after a rotten day at work and seeing those excited faces and enthusiastic greetings - nothing beats it ;)|`|8q82dLS8aa	I did<br>  <br>  she was perfect<br>  <br>  she died at the age of 12 in november<br>  <br>  :( RIP Meg|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	we have 2, 4 year old brothers.

Bathing more frequently strips the skin and coat of natural oils that protect the skin from sun, wind, and other elemental exposure.  If the dog has fleas try a spray such as natures guardian (smells good and doesn't have any side effects) or you can try Comfortis, a pill that gets rid of fleas.  Just make sure your dog can be outside for at least two hours supervised while the fleas fall off.  It's seriously gross how they drop off in such a short period of time.|`|dbe3949bbbedd96e00cdf1a2462e0484aa	i have a black lab  and i bath her about once a week  and i have a mini schnauzer and i bathe her the same amount of time both get bathed  in a flea bath and as the schnauzer is older and has a minor skin irritation i bath her with a flea soap and then a medicated  soap <br>  <br>  vacuum your floors  and then spray  with a flea spray  do this several times a week  as the fleas will not live on the dog  but jump on them feed and then jump off    make sure you cleaning there bedding  i put there bedding in the washer every other month to kill any fleas in there or eggs|`|XqxnGPg3aa	I have a rottweiler. My vet said for short haired dogs, they should be bathed once every 2 months. It's important for them to keep their natural oils in their skin.

wfOIYFYqaa	I have had the same problems with gerbils. well not the problem you have, but what i did when one of mine was sick is call a vet, tell them your situation, and if they cant help have them referr you to the closest small animal vet.  Call them, tell them your problem and your gerbils symptoms and they should be able to give you some guidance on how to fix the problem if it is fixable without having to pay a pretty price.  if they can't help, i've gotten alot of help from local pet stores that have gerbils.  i would try petco or a larger petstore first.  Hope everything goes well for you. and I no from experience that if you call or just walk into a vet and tell them your problem they should be more than happy to help you in anyway that they can.  vets have helped me out that way.  good luck.|`|39KUKALFaa	That is sad.

We call her Zuzu.<br>  I sold a lady a 2 year old North Carolina bred & born TWH filly named "Little Bit" because she looked little, but she wasn't (a big little mare).  The lady changed her name to "Dakota" and the horse won't answer to it.  The horse is now 5 and to this day I can still go into her pasture and yell "Hey Little Bit!" and she'll come running, her owner can stand beside me and holler "Dakota" and the horse ignores her.<br>  My Arab/Mustang started out as "April Fool", then became "Chip" for Chip off the old Block (he acted just like his sire-bad habits & all) and when we started showing, he became Chippewa Warrior.  I wanted to honor his mustang blood with a Native name, but not knowing which state his Mustang mom came from, I didn't know which tribe to use.  So, since I'm from Ohio and our area used to be Chippewa tribal lands, I used Chippewa.  Warrior just followed because the horse is tough and fearless!  So, Chippewa Warrior.<br>  The AQHA colt I bought in South Dakota last year was a tough one.  He was registered as DPH Mischief Maker, but we call him Chief.

Reason:  I was in the warm up arena at a horse show at Oak Tree, San Dimas, CA just working on a posting trot when this little pony trotted by, rang it's tail and hit my then 8 yr old AQHA gelding square in the nose!  He brought his head UP, hit the end of those side reins and STRAIGHT back into my face!  He put my two front teeth through my bottom lip.<br>  <br>  PLEASE, don't ride with side reins!|`|an1L8njXaa	ARGGG please dont tie his head down, i'd be getting rid of your instructor instead.<br>  <br>  On the bit does not come by dragging the horses head down, it comes from working the horse up into its bridle from its back end.<br>  Get the back end working properly and the horses weight moved onto its inside hind leg and the rest will come.<br>  You NEVER hold a horses head in place, you ask for submission and the horse flexes and submits, it should feel like there is very little at the end of the reins as the horse should be so light in the mouth<br>  <br>  <br>  Side reins are only a usefull tool to encourage the head down IF your horse is useing its back end properly. they should never ever be used to tie a head down there should always be some give in them so the horse can move its head.<br>  <br>  No you cannot ride in them.<br>  <br>  Fire your instructor and get one who actualy knows what they are talking about.|`|u1HahCoqaa	They are a training aid- you use them on the longe to help encourage the horse to reach down and round minimally. It does not pull their head down- which would not work. You would just ruin the horse with such a practice, and besides you are not truly achieving roundness. You cannot pull a horse into a frame- they have to come into it. It is not simply in the head- it is a state of the whole body. Properly used sidereins do not tie the horses head down. You should always start out with very long set ones and gradually shorten them- and they should never get too short. There are multiple stories of horses freaking out in them and flipping over backwards. <br>  <br>  As for help adjusting you should ask your trainer....and no, do not ride in them. Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you were looking for a shortcut to roundness, if you are looking for your horse to truly come through then there is no shortcut. If your trainer is having you yank your horse into a frame and wants you to tie the head down, you should find another.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Do NOT ride in side reins EVER.<br>  They are intended to be used as a training aid to ENCOURAGE the horse to lower it's head - not to force it to.<br>  I think it is extremely negligent/thoughtless of your trainer to suggest this and then just leave you with the idea. <br>  If you strap the horse's head into place it's likely to freak out and you could get injured in the aftermatth.<br>  I agree - get a new instructor/trainer. Get one who will actually work with you.<br>  Rounding up and collecting actually starts from behind - the neck is about the last thing you need to worry about.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Do not use side reins, use another instructor instead!<br>  <br>  Side reins will only force the horse to keep his head on the vertical.  Despite what everyone on YA seems to think, that is NOT what we do with heads!  The head will sort itself out when the rider is riding correctly and bringing the horse forward with the leg into a soft hand.  He needs to step right underneath himself and reach forwards with his front legs, lifting his shoulder as he does so and stretching across the whole of his top line - this also creates work for the horse's abdominal muscles.  You need to be able to do that on your own without reaching for destructive gadgets.<br>  <br>  It is not a case of force the head on the vertical and hope the legs will follow - that's all back to front.  If you insist he keeps his head down he will lose any impulsion he may have started to gain as he resists being whacked in the mouth and his training and movement will start to go backwards.  The horse's front is used for balance - if you take his head and neck away from him he won't go forwards correctly because he isn't able to!<br>  <br>  "Roundness" is not the aim, correct movement is.  When I judge I don't expect to see any animal under the age of 8 or 9 being "round" because it takes enormous skill and balance for the horse to carry himself; he needs very good muscle to be able to maintain it, and I'd much prefer people worked on balance and going forwards first.  I do not care where the head's going for the first 4 years of work because it takes that long to get the hang of it (and that's with a good consistent rider) and it may take longer - who cares, so long as the horse isn't being forced out of balance.<br>  <br>  If you allow him to balance himself and make him go forwards, he will offer you his mouth when he is ready to do so.|`|dvRv6zyVaa	Side reins are mainly for lunging<br>  I would suggest draw reins. They connect to the girth, go up through the bit and into your hands?<br>  If these are different to what you'ree talking about, I would suggest these instead as you can adjust these like normal reins whilst riding.<br>  You shouldn't keep them tight, as the horse will get frustrated and probably rear. Draw reins when used correctly are a great aid and are in no way tying the horses head down.<br>  <br>  With draw reins, you only use them as a guide, and once the horse collects, you slacken the reins lightly and they will learn to hold themselves correctly, without leaning on the bit. While their head is in the correct position, you encourage them with leg aids to collect correctly, so its hind is engaged.<br>  <br>  Talk to a professional about draw reins, they were amazing when I was training my OTT Thoroughbreds.<br>  I had crazy TB that used to lean on the bits so badly that after a month of riding him I needed chiropractic work, and now he is amazing to ride.|`|FtEkredUaa	If your going to use side rains start off with putting them longer, this will then allow your horse to realise that they are there. After a couple of times you can start to tighten them, its a good way to teach your horse as they learn to bring there back up in to an arch and it will teach your horse to work from the hind forward. Its a good exercise for your horse, its not a bad thing and yes you can ride with side rains. Just don't put then on tight straight away as your horse will not adjust to them. Work the process slowly.|`|RDZGo6kQaa	The idea is if he throws his head to get away fom the pressure, more is applied. They are normally elestic so that the horse can pull but learns that he is pulling against himself so fighting isnt worth it and he keeps his head down. He may be really bad the first time but hes just getting used to them. At fist, put them on reallly long so he can get used to it, then slowly adjust them so they are tighter, over a perod of time. Ask your trainer to go into more detail with you. I only lunge with them, but not sure about riding. Perhaps lunge fo 20mins with them, then ride after?|`|BREi7qw7aa	side riens are nice for any horse really, BUT only when lunging!! Have your trainer show you how to adjust them. Trust me, if they are on wrong your horse with have a fit!! So has your horse ever been lunged with side riens? if not, start out really really loose, so your horse can move its head and get use to having the pressure. Gradually tightned them, until they are the right size. If your horse is really bad riding, then try draw riens, but make sure you ask your trainer first!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	People do use side reins while lunging the horse to work on collection. The important thing while doing so is to keep the horse moving forward and encouraging them to work off of their hindquarters.  You do not want to ride them with these on can be VERY dangerous.<br>  <br>  Lunging them in side reins can also be dangerous because if you tie them down to tight and they are not comfortable they may rear and flip over to try to get out of it.<br>  <br>  Instead we start them out in draw reins on the lunge line.  So, to answer your question start out with just a little pressure and increase it as they grow more comfortable and build there muscle tone and balance.   You cannot just force them to tuck their head suddenly, they will get a Charley horse in their neck.<br>  <br>  We like draw reins better because they can still move their head up and down while flexing at the pole.  It give them a chance for movement and allows them to find their happy place.  But again when working on collection it is very important to keep them driving forward off of their hindquarters.<br>  <br>  Jenny
d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	The thing that annoys me most is the people who don't even bother looking up their question before asking. There are probably hundreds, if not thousands of answers how to potty train your dog, what's the best food, etc. <br>  <br>  Not sure that I have a favorite breed, but I'd have to seriously think about taking in a strange dog. What's it's background? temperament? health? Does it get along with other pets? I have two dogs and two cats, and I think that's plenty for now lol.|`|X7i59NeIaa	I think there are lots of dumb questions on here. The ones that bother me most are the people who ask questions about their obviously sick dog instead of taking him to the vet.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I would take it.|`|UETAqR8Taa	a lot seem very young with parents who dont care what is going on, which is why they turn to us not their poor parents. poor as in wont speend the money except on booze, blunt but probably true in a lot of cases|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I'm not annoyed by other people's questions about dogs.  If i met a nuclear physicist, i would probably have loads of questions for them because i haven't much knowledge on the subject.  <br>  <br>  Many people know little to nothing about dogs.<br>  <br>  If i were walking down the street and someone offered me my favorite type of dog on the spot, i'd be suspicious about the dog in the first place, and secondly if i were to take on another dog, a lot of thought and research would go into the decision first.  (most likely i'd get a rescue dog)<br>  <br>  have a good night|`|W02kTOqmaa	Legit: I would take said dog, and then kick myself about 10 minutes later. I already have two shepherds, and seeing as how I am starting school again soon and it is slow season at work, I REALLY can't afford another dog financially and time wise, lol. BUT I would find a way because of course I would already be attached, and my animals come first.<br>  <br>  I think there are very few people who would turn down a free purebred of their favorite breed (unless of course it had some major issues like health or aggression problems)|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	well someone offered me a whippet like that I take it & decide later if I should turn it over to the breed rescue. Most whippet fanciers I know would do the same. Many have - to the point of getting up at 10:30  at night and driving an hour to retrieve a dog. Whippet rescue has us well trained not to leave one of our own in trouble.<br>  <br>  Pet peeve (or more like WHAT the hey?) people trying to decide between vastly different dogs Pomeranian or Great Dane. Haven't they a clue of  what they want in a dog?<br>  <br>  Edit : new peeve- just looked at another picture (what breeds are in my pup question ) once again it consisted of a nose closeup. How do you determne anything from that? sometimes the dog is even covered by a dog coat!|`|PUiPeJqVaa	I'll take the dog..<br>  <br>  Yeah, a lot of people are stupid.. just like dogs.... ^^

yLwKWzIUaa	if your breeder hasn't, and has no plans on showing her then i don't see why u'd need to clip her tail.<br>  the short tail is simply a breed standard that is required for conformation (showing)<br>  it's usually done when the puppies are only a few weeks old, so she's probably too old now anyway.<br>  i wouldnt. :)|`|bIaywrBCaa	tail docking should be done no later than 4 days old. Much too traumatic for her now.|`|SaCqoG0Faa	Your pet is too old to have their tail docked now. The only way a vet would dock it now is for a medical reason.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Firstly this breed should NOT have a docked tail and secondly if you do that now it would cruel and illegal. The dog is too old to have a limb removed without a general anaesthetic.  Tell your stupid friend to mind their own business !|`|EeJMITyCaa	The only reason to cut a dog's tail is if the dog will be a working dog (to prevent work accidents) or if its the breed standard. If neither then there is no reason to cut a puppies tail.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	NO!!! Why would you to give up the sight of a joyful tail wag?|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Dogs communicate with their tails and body language. By docking the tail, they can be misread by owners and other dogs. This has been a huge oversight with owners. I wouldn't do it. Dogs tails use to be docked in order to protect them from getting harmed like hunting dogs, and guard dogs. Its the reason why my doby's tails and ears have been left alone. Sounds like its an aesthetic reason as to why you would be doing it. Also, the dog might be too old already. Don't bother.|`|6b3fd330dd0ad7c1bdcb07718498e43aaa	Go to the AKC website and read on the specs of the breed and what are requirements for show. If you are showing her, that is. If not, don't alter her.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	they (king charles spaniels) are not frequently docked (tails cut) so WHY? Especially since at this age it's major surgery|`|lKVORFx7aa	i would look up on the web to see what others have done if it was me i wouldn't|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Too late to cut her tail now.  A reputable vet would not do it.
rrLHU6ehaa	OOPS!<br>  Well, they might make it, depending on how long they were in the "cleaned" tank and the condition they're in now.  Definitely transfer them and try.  Sounds like you're doing the right things.<br>  Fortunately, those aren't expensive fish, but the tank can be.  The best thing to do with it since it's been soaped is to get rid of it.  Forget selling it or donating it to thrift stores, as it shouldn't be used as an aquarium anymore.  At least I wouldn't.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Getting the fish in to clean water is the best you can do for them.<br>  <br>  Rinsing the heck out of the tank, then leaving if full of water for a few weeks should allow the soap to break down. It will be broken down by bacteria in a natural ecosystem. Thats why the sea isn't full of soap. But even a small amount of detergent or soap is toxic to fish untill it breaks down.<br>  <br>  So the tank can be re-used, but I would set it up outside and let some algae and snails test drive it first.<br>  <br>  Ian
RjpGomsyaa	I adopted two male collie dogs 5 years ago & the cost was approx ￡100 each hope this helps|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	If you go to the website fro your local shelter the prices should be on there.  WIthin the RSPCA the shelters have individual policies, including pricing, kill/no kill etc.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	All dogs are the same price despite their size, gender or breed.  The only thing that affects the price is if they were already altered before the shelter ever received them.<br>  <br>  You can go to their website to get plenty of facts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RSPCA/RSPCARedirect&pg=RSPCAHome" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellit...</a>|`|Bw18seFqaa	each shelter has its own policy and adoption fees.<br>  <br>  Some may price depending on if its a puppy or an adult..  purebred or mix.  One local shelter near me charges more for females, but that's to offset the cost of the spay.  Another shelter near me just charges for the dog licence.<br>  <br>  Contact the shelter and find out what their policy is|`|kykmpr0Caa	at the blue cross its around 60 or 70.oo for a dog, i expect the rspca would be around the same|`|L5tWiYOFaa	It'd be cheaper to buy a quality steak from the butchers to be perfectly honest.|`|pFwMIMLAaa	Well it all depends. I would go to their website, they should have specific adoption prices on each dog listed.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking thoug, puppies are always more expensive than adults, the older the dog the cheaper. It also depends on the breed and size. The smaller the dog the more expensive as well.<br>  <br>  I've seen puppies on humane society sites for more than a papered puppy!<br>  <br>  But they also charge you based on the vet care it has recieved, like if it needed surgery. Hope this helps. Im sorry I don't have an exact amount. :(<br>  <br>  Addition:<br>  I checked out the Oregon Humane Society for some reference and this is what I found out:<br>  <br>  There were lab puppies for $200 and bull terrior puppies for $200 and pit mix puppies for about $150. And there was a cocker spaniel mix for $300.<br>  <br>  The 10 year old german shepherd mix however was only $55. And a 5 year old jack russel mix was $150.<br>  <br>  So like I said before it all depends on the dog. At least at my humane society. They charge less for older dogs because people don't want to pay a lot of money for an older dog, and they charge more for puppies because everyone wants puppies and younger dogs, and they know that the the puppies are likely to be adopted.|`|mR5RkClpaa	i dont know how much it costs but whatever it is it is worth it, they dont charge , so to benifit money they charge, to prove you really want dog, and will not abandon it,you are more likely to want and to keep dog if you pay , you will also be vetted to make sure you are suitable for the dog.! and rightly so|`|2eJcaeOPaa	at my local rspca they are ￡95 for puppies and adults <br>  check your local centre|`|g2MUFb8Jaa	I don't think the price differs that much. About $70 I think ($ means pounds, my keyboard doesn't have a pound sign!)
dPKc9a10aa	hi hannah why don't you try a caveson with a flash strap if you are not sure what to buy or what suits your horse, see if anyone on your yard has this type of noseband that you could try on your horse first.a grackle has a specific.job stopping the horse openingmouth and crossing jaw over avoiding the bit.I would try and see. If anyone can let you try before you buy if possible|`|GsHnGHzKaa	Some horses dont really "agree" with grackles and can have quite bad reactions to them. I would only recommend you buy a grackle if your horse tries to evade the bit and opens his mouth when you are riding him and crosses his jaw. That is the purpose of a grackle, to prevent the horse from avoiding the contact.<br>  If you just ride in a drop noseband with no flash then the best thing for you to try would just be a simple cavesson noseband. These are the most "horse friendly"! <br>  A cavesson might be a good idea even if your horse does need a flash as you can just simply attach a flash to the noseband if you need to

Boston Terriers are a lot cheaper then French Bulldogs. Frenchies are expensive because they have small litters, are extremely hard to breed and usually require C-sections during birth. Frenchies also have more health concerns such as stenotic nares, disc degeneration, hemivertebrae, etc. The life span of a Boston Terrier is also a few years longer then the Frenchies. <br>  Other then that, Boston Terriers and Frenchies are very similar. Both breeds in my opinion are adorable and I would find it very difficult to choose between the two. <br>  <br>  I really like Animal Planets Dog Breed Directory.<br>  Boston Terrier link  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogprofile.do?id=1450" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>  <br>  French Bulldog link <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogprofile.do?id=1510" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|f0egZ7Sdaa	Each have their own advantages.<br>  <br>  I have a BT, whereas my friend has a Frenchie.

For all the trouble she is now with clawing it would have been nothing compared to afterwards, aside from the devastating effect it would have had on your cat you might also have found yourself with a sick and aggressive little cat who couldn't or wouldn't use her litter box due to the pain in her paws.<br>  <br>  The log idea is brilliant, there are is also more advice about training cats to use scratching posts here<br>  <a href="http://clawsforever.ning.com/group/anniesbible/forum/topics/scratching-posts-and-training" rel="nofollow">http://clawsforever.ning.com/group/annie...</a>  written by the US author Annie Bruce and a bit more about declawing here <a href="http://clawsforever.ning.com/group/anniesbible/forum/topics/declawing-drawbacks" rel="nofollow">http://clawsforever.ning.com/group/annie...</a> also by Annie Bruce<br>  <br>  Anyway good luck and once again so glad you're against the declawing|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	this may seem odd, but i had a problem with a cat who did this too.<br>  <br>  i found an old log which was so dry it was like driftwood outside in my travels.  I brought it home, doused it with a few pots of boiling water (outdoors of course) just in case there were any bugs in/on it...and let it dry back out.  brought it in the house, and my cat loved it.  <br>  <br>  strange, but true.|`|AA11589437	"the only option left is to declaw her" : NO!<br>  Declawing should never be an option. It is not an option in the rest of teh world otehr than the US, it is illegal and people would go to jail for that where I live. There is a reason for that, it  is completely inhumane.<br>  As for your option, try www.softpaws.com<br>  Plastic claw caps. Also, trim her nails with a nail clipper every 2 weeks. Just the pointed tip. And get some cheap throws to put on your sofas, so that she can scratch those.<br>  Also, a rattan rug will be much more appealing for her than teh sofas. My cats nevr use scratching posts, tehy have no idea what they're for, but rattan rugs and cushions are their favourite.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Of course...<br>  <br>  If you give her a nice tall scratching post, she will most likely use the post, happily. You can try sprinkling it with catnip to attract her to it. If that doesn't work, use your own nails to scratch at the post while your cat is watching. It may sound silly, but it works. Some cats who have been yelled at each time they are caught scratching will be reluctant to use the post in front of you at first. Any time you see your cat scratching somewhere else, say “No.” firmly and carry them to the post. <br>  <br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Any time she scratches or bites you, (whether she's playing or she's mad) say "OUCH!" really loud, then walk away from her. If you've ever heard a cat howl when you accidentally stepped on its tail, mimicking that noise will work well too. Walking away from her helps her understand that when she hurts you, that makes you not want to pet or play with her any more.<br>  <br>  <br>  More information about declawing:<br>  Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.|`|3d4b2654fc96ab1563a5733a8f9521daaa	I used to use with my year old kitty that didn't want to stop clawing everything a product called soft paws.. its been a while since I had to use them. But they glued onto the nails after they were clipped.. it saved my furniture.. my skin and my fiancee's skin from being all clawed up. I used to put them on all of her claws. The cat never tried to bite or lick at them in fact, she would play run and all that with them on.. I normally had to replace them about every two months with her usage..|`|03a83c2c29f05e3eab7e68b87d6081e6aa	dont declaw! thats so mean.....wen u catch her in the act have u tried shouting and a loud clap at the same time to scare the crap out of her, sounds a bit mean but they run away and my cat learned not to do it that way...u have to make the experience of her scratching it as horrible as possible...u know like the dentist! u neva wanna go there!|`|d117b76aa3f6f229fe72ee9d450704f0aa	De-clawing is inhumane, like the 1st poster said it is amputation. They cut off part of the digits to prevent nail growth.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you tried a variety of things. You should also try nail caps. Cardboard scratchers are not as satisfying as sisal scratchers. Try using sisal scratching posts and pads. You can encourage your cat to use the sisal scratching post/pad initially by spraying catnip or honeysuckle (not all cats react to catnip, honeysuckle should work). <br>  <br>  This is tacky but when you are not home you can put the clear plastic carpet protector with the plastic spikes over the arms of the sofa, spikes up, to keep her off while you are not around. When you are home you can spray her with water to reinforce her dislike for being on the arm of the sofa. Hopefully, over time you can do away with the plastic protector. I don't really know what it is called but you'll be able to find it at Home Depot or fabric store. They sell them by either the foot/ yard, you cut the amount you want off a big roll. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ztlYJtwGaa	DON'T DECLAW HER!!!<br>  <br>  a friend of mine declawed her cat and regretted it! because a dog chased her cat and then her cat tried to climb a tree and it didnt have any nails so the dog killed her cat!<br>  <br>  just cut the curved bit of her nail monthly and you should be ok<br>  <br>  declawing her will just take away so many things for her<br>  <br>  like when they go to do their business in the kitty litter or garden they need their nails to dig a hole and they need their nails to cover it up<br>  <br>  also if they want to climb trees. you dont want the same thing that happened to my friends cat to happen to your's<br>  <br>  and when she goes to play with a toy she needs her nails to play. they get really depressed and become lazy<br>  <br>  i could write a whole book on why not to declaw your cat<br>  <br>  just whatever you do DON'T DECLAW HER<br>  <br>  believe me she wont be the same cat she was before|`|IuYekkPVaa	So glad to hear that you don't want to declaw.  It's always been illegal where I live, so it's the good old scratch post I've relied upon to save furniture and it really does work..<br>  <br>  Part of a cat's desire to scratch is to mark territory, both visually and with the scent glands on their paws. When that scent begins to fade, they need to keep it topped up and that's why they always scratch in the same spots. To discourage her from scratching the arms of your sofa you need to temporarily cover them or use something citrus scented to conceal her claw scent.  Feliway is also excellent at preventing unwanted scratching. (It mimics the scent from their facial glands and they don't generally scratch areas that they rub their faces against). You need to spray Feliway once a day for 21 days for it to prevent scratching.<br>  <br>  Because scratching is often about marking territory, sometimes it's the location that is important to the cat, so place her scratch post next to the sofa. Is the post a large and steady one? If it wobbles slightly, this will put her off using it. Try rubbing the post with catnip or spraying it with honeysuckle to encourage her to use it. Another trick is to trail toys or pieces of string over it so that she has to grab for them with her claws. This is usually enough to give them the idea that it feels good to scratch there. Not all cats like using posts because the sisal is wound horizontally and most cats prefer to scratch something with a vertical thread. If this is the case, try offering her a few alternatives.  Our male cat is very good and uses both his post and a wooden log, but our female is fussy and will only scratch corrugated cardboard.  I even bought her one of the scratchers that contains a cardboard block but she refused to use it, so I just save empty cardboard boxes and she seem happiest scratching those.  With trial and error, you wil eventually find something your cat enjoys using. Cats are much more inclined to adopt behaviours that benefit them in some way, so be sure to reward her with food treats and lots of praise when she does use her scratch item. Once it's impregnated with her paw scent, she will continue to use it in order to keep the smell topped up so that every one knows it belongs to her.<br>  <br>  This article is worth reading because it has lots of really useful information on why cats scratch and advice on encouraging them to use a scratch post.  It also has lots of suggestions on ways you can protect furniture, wallpaper etc., which you may find helpful.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	There are plastic thingies that can be glued over the claws, your vet maybe can help with that. They are not permanent and may have to be redone. I agree declawing is very inhumane, it's actual amputation not just nail removal.

PM23RDycaa	Hey don't insult furries by throwing Cesar at us. Just because he loves animals doesn't mean he's a furry. I wouldn't believe it until I saw him IN a fursuit at a convention<br>  <br>  For those who don't know:<br>  A furry generally refers to a person who enjoys stories, art, and other media relating to furry characters. What's a furry character? It's an anthropomorphized animal, i.e. an animal with human-like attributes (being able to walk upright or having human-like hands and feet, or being able to speak). Another way to think of this is a human with animal-like traits (ears, fur, tail). Furries enjoy drawing, writing stories about, discussing, or watching cartoons of furry characters. Furry characters include toons or cartoon characters, and it is not uncommon for discussions of commercial cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny, Mrs. Brisby (The Secret Of NIMH), or Fifi La Fume (Tiny Toon Adventures) to be common among furries. Now the term furry can be a bit misleading... a creature does not need to have fur to be furry in this sense. Crocodiles, lizards, eagles, and worms can also be furry.<br>  <br>  ADD: And what the hell does being a furry have to do with being gay? Are a lot of male furries gay? Sure but there are straight fans of the fandom both male and female.<br>  <br>  And being married with kids doesn't mean Cesar can't be gay, considering how many men and women who were in fact gay led straight lives(lies) to avoid being shunned by their peers and families.<br>  <br>  ADD: it wasn't a dig Dancer I was just saying being married with kids doesn't meant the man couldn't be living a lie.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Okay, I give up.

dudNDUBkaa	Honestly, if a dog is growling a barring its teeth at some one just for approaching it then it probably has some aggression or confidence problems. I would suggest socializing the dog further before bringing it into a place where there are lots of people. A school can be an intimidating place for a dog, especially a dog that has obviously showed aggression towards an approaching person. Before throwing a dog into a school full of people I would suggest introducing it to s few people at a time and see how it handles it. Dogs that are brought into school or nursing homes are usually required to meet certain criteria that show it has the social skills necessary for being around so many people at once. Please keep the dogs well being in mind before pushing into a situation that would make it feel intimidated and therefore act out of fear and hurt someone. Wouldn't want the poor dog to be put down for trying to protect itself.|`|c5eeba4eae0b989e5215d3cd6ec48329aa	No dog should be allowed in public if it growls and bares its teeth.<br>  It is a menace.

meMF69tXaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Well, my specialty is rabbits. However, in my experience in the vet field, we used to have some ferret patients from time to time.<br>  <br>  Each individual animal group has a leader. In order for that leader to take the lead position, he/she has to show dominance towards everyone in the group. For some animal groups, the female takes the dominant spot and for others, the male take the dominant spot. Animals such as ferrets, have scent glands and when they mark their territory, they will display rubbing, scratching and scent marking behavior. It could be that your ferret is trying to show dominance over the others in the group.<br>  <br>  Now I don't know much about ferret discipline, but I do know that animals can become frustrated and bored just like humans. The transition from one cage to another could be frustrating your ferret. It can also be traumatic.<br>  <br>  I do not recommend scruffing an animal. Mainly because it is aggressive behavior towards the animal (even done lightly) and animals can display the behavior that you teach them. (Hope that makes sense) <br>  <br>  Good luck with your ferrets. It sounds like you are a good ferret parent, just a little frustrated right now. Hopefully, things will improve.

What dog gets fed 4 times per day?|`|GSf09ALBaa	If the dog needs one can of food a day and should be fed 4 times a day that means:<br>  <br>       You take the ONE can and separate it evenly into 4 different <br>        feedings.|`|vouUQQzBaa	you divide the amount advised in the label by the times you feed.<br>  <br>  meaning 1/4 can per feeding (in the case you mentioned above)<br>  <br>  Surely that isn't the only thing you'd be feeding though?|`|RAN9Lr8Iaa	you need help with math.

SzW9GmRsaa	Get over it!  If you're going to ride horses other than your own you're bound to sit on a few you like, that's part of life.  You can't buy every horse that goes well for you under saddle.<br>  <br>  Accept that you have your own horse (who in pre-April times was pretty darn perfect) and gracefully accept gift rides without being snotty and wanting to keep all the nice ones.|`|j77Yqrlnaa	If she's too expensive, forget about it. Just enjoy the time you have on April and learn as much as you can from her. Think like you are just riding her to get into show shape or for excersise or for teaching you. It's strictly business. You have a great horse who you love, so just forget about owning April. Maybe you can have a few good months with her, but when you ride other horses, you are going to find a few you like.<br>  <br>  I have my own horse and lease another one (my horse got navicular), and I like the horse I am leasing, but would never buy her. I am training her for hunters and what we have is business. We learn from each other and have fun, but I constantly think "I wonder how far she'll get and where she'll go. I'll be happy the day she makes someone smile."|`|QGecNxmgaa	Well, if your parents aren't going to buy her for you, how come your complaining...Your lucky you even have a horse...I've liked horses since I was 3 and now I'm 15 and I still don't have one. Be happy and love the one you have...someone will buy april...so what, you have yours.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	I think the only reason you love April is because she's so experienced and made. A lot of the girls at my barn buy made horses, but really, she's not going to teach you anything. Your young, learn to ride and train - not how to look pretty on top of a horse.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|5VamTDKMaa	If you want to train your horse I would've picked Jasmine. If you had April . . . that's know fun, not just fun but you can have a talent of working with horses.|`|AA10776535	If your parents don't want to pay for another horse you cant blame them...When you get older you can buy as many as you can afford.   I have a horse rescue and i have a few personal horses, well i have two one i ride and a baby...well yesterday i went and looked at horses that the owner couldn't afford anymore, all papered and really nice, i took them...There was one that caught my eye, well she wont be adopted out and is now mine, she is 4 years old black and white almost 16 hands stunning beauty, but see i can afford to take on others because i use my own money.  When you get older and have a career or whatever you can buy as many as you wish...I got really lucky and got this one for free :)  Ima happy Camper Starbuck is all mine :)|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	I know what your going through, I had the same thing happen to me with a horse name Shammah.  Sadly, if you don't have the money and your parents won't let you then there is nothing you can do but spend as much time with her and show her as much love as possible.  Another idea is that you can always ask the new owner if you can come and see her and ride on occasion, or talk one of your horsey friends into buying her so you can see her more often.|`|1MlJxlVRaa	ok so im 15 and going to be buying my own horse and supporting it with...my own money! that means that i have to grow up and make sacrafices to keep my boy<3<br>  you on the other hand have a horse that mum and daddy probably pay for who was perfect before april came around and now you want to get another horse...<br>  your parents wont buy her so please stop complaining.<br>  i dont mean to sound rude but it is the truth.|`|Hwra2uj4aa	If you love your own horse, why even consider another? Is it because April has an amazing past that you want to buy her? To brag about her? I feel sorry for your own horse, be lucky you actually have one, and can support one! There are so many kids out there that would love a horse, but can not support them. The bottom line is, you do sound like a spoiled brat.<br>  You are never going to get what you want in life, deal with it.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	You sound so spoilt, sorry but you do. If you have such a good horse then stop complaining. If your mum and dad wont buy her for you just forget it. I've got 1 horse and love him to bits and would never get rid of him, i waited 11 yrs out of my 14yrs for a horse and havn't complained once since i got him. Be thankfull you have Jasmine many people would die for a horse and you have one. Sorry but you are acting spoilt.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Its up to your parents if you cannot pay the bills yourself, so there is nothing you can do since they said no.  Enjoy the horse you do have, you can always buy a second down the road.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|mvQMYNLraa	be happy u even have a horse|`|nXxdvgwLaa	No offense, but you are sounding really selfish. There are very many horses out there with amazing pasts and I even went through the same thing. There was a 7 time state champion gelding that I rode for riding lessons and I loved him so much but I knew I couldn't have him. You should be very grateful you have Jasmine. 2 years ago I had finally gotten a horse after waiting many years for one and my parents sold him later because he would act crazy when we rode him. I will finally be getting another horse in 2 weeks. A whole lot of people are way less fortunate than you.|`|x787hJbBaa	I agree with katherine c. I am sorry but you do sound spoiled. I half lease a QH gelding and I want more then anything in the world to have a horse. Count yourself lucky you have one, because by your attitude, probably half the people who answer horse questions on yahoo would die to have a horse, myself included. Here is an Aesop statement that seems to fit this situation: To a miser, what he has is of no more use then what he has not. Be happy you have a horse, and don't start complaining because you want another one. I don't mean to be mean but I would do anything to have a horse. I have to save 300 dollars in 3 months so I can full lease over the SUMMER. Be glad you own a horse, and be happy you can ride April. Another Aesop statement: Those who suffer the least often cry out the loudest.|`|tLzKEDMlaa	There is always going to be anothe one you fall in love with. If you got her it will happen someday with another horse... thats life

eWKaVtJGaa	1<br>  Observe the rat's nail very careful and identify the pink area called the "quick," which contains nerves and tiny blood vessels. You do not want to cut into the quick. If you do, the nail will bleed.<br>  Step2<br>  Use the trimmer to trim off just the very tips of the nails, making sure to stay well back from the quick. Make sure you have "Qwik Stop" powder (or at least some white flour) right next to you, just in case you accidentally cut the quick.<br>  Step3<br>  Use a magnifying device if you find that you cannot see the tips of the nails well enough to trim them without cutting the quick.<br>  Step4<br>  If you accidentally cut into the quick and the nail starts to bleed, immediately apply pressure to the area using a facial tissue, then dab on some "Qwik Stop" or some while flour. Don't panic if the nail still bleeds--it will eventually stop. The rat probably won't be bothered by the bleeding nearly as much as you will be. Put on a second coat of powder if necessary. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  <br>      * A nail trimmer (the folding type)<br>      * Facial tissue<br>      * "Qwik Stop" powder (can substitute white flour)<br>      * Optional: magnifying device (if you have trouble seeing small things that are up close)|`|JmD0oq2Naa	id get your vet to do it. or put some stones in her cage, one of my rats had really long nails but they were nice and short and a few weeks as he had been walking over the stone|`|I6KKFwxXaa	you can try to do it yourself but wouldn't suggest it by all means I use baby nail clippers on mine and have even been told can file just the tip with emory boards and have tried that also but held Gracie and cried like a baby so yes vet is best then you won't think you are hurting them and cry. Stones or have even seen brick or rocks however since mine are hairless they scratch so easily and brick is rough and has sharp edges sometimes pretty much a parent choice I would try the stones and see how that works for ya and if it doesn't then go on to next step. you would place them under water where they go a lot|`|BWez86Ldaa	You're not really "suppose" to clip her nails. I've never done this and have never had problems with bad scratches, at least nothing that I'm not already use to with cats. :P If you absolutely "need" to do clip her nails, though, you should follow the instructions given in another answer, found on Ehow. <br>  <br>  When: You should do it in the morning as ratties tend to be sleepier in the morning as they are mostly nocturnal creatures.<br>  <br>  Where: Anywhere, I'd suggest the bathroom sink, though, as she won't get lost if she runs off.<br>  <br>  What: Probably baby clippers.|`|O5HMemdJaa	hey cane<br>  isent that aussiepr...<br>  a jerk he is sooo mean when he answered my Q he was a jerk and look at him now diff person same animal!!!!! anyway to the Q, i really hate cliping small animals i cannot do it soo i dont! i rather get a proffesional to cut them! i mean if you try to cut them and u miss guess what happens! i would get a pro for the saick of the rat, maybe include it with the vet check up or somethign (if the vet do that!)<br>  <br>  anyway hope i helped again!

GSf09ALBaa	You explained yourself very well.  I can see, hear and feel the pain and anxiety you and your family is going through with your dog.  <br>  <br>  The only advice I can possibly give you is to consider everyone's quality of life.  Yours, your childs, your upcoming child and your dog.<br>  <br>  I know you have spent thousands of dollars with tests, vet runs, etc.  But I am going to suggest checking into one more thing and this is holistic vet care.  There are alternatives to pain killers.  And there may very well be a way to treat this problem through homeopathic remedies, orthopedic and acupuncture.<br>  <br>  ADD:  I know that holistic medicine to kill heartworms works.  This is totally natural and takes about a month.  It really works.  I am fostering a 3 year old Dachshund that had moderate heartworms.  She is now HW neg with the holistic treatment.  Please, please consider it.  Before you do anything else.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Has your vet never suggested taking him to a vet who's qualified to do either acupuncture or chiropractic treatments?  I can't tell you how much my dogs (they have calcium deposits and one dog was screaming in pain from the deposits on his neck) have benefited.  They're kept totally pain free after a course of treatments and now all they need are occasional "tune-ups".  <br>  <br>  I'd look into it if this was my dog - and the treatments aren't expensive.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	May I ask what medications he is on? Also,when he has a "spasm" or whatever it is,place a warm,moist compress on the area and gently massage it.You could even rub horse liniment into the area.You might also ask your vet to prescribe a stronger muscle relaxant or an oral sedative or tranquilizer to give to him when this happens.A glucosamine/chondroitin supplement like Cosequin DS,Dasuquin or Phycox JS may also help,and magnesium and potassium are both really helpful for muscle spasms.These are all available at your veterinarian.<br>  <br>  Edit: Since this vet is reluctant to give you any sedatives for the dog,perhaps you should see another vet? But try the warm compresses,they really do help.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Poor guy :o(<br>  <br>  I had a chihuahua who had a similar problem.  I would flip him over in my lap and do therapeutic massage on his back.  If you do the massage right, it forces the spasming muscle to relax. <br>  Once I started doing that he was fine.<br>  <br>  Granted, it would be harder to do with a big dog, but you might give it a try.  It also wouldnt hurt to give him a food with (or add to his food) glucosamine and chondroitine, in case arthritis is a factor.<br>  <br>  *********<br>  Therapeutic massage is not just rubbing the neck.  Its actually finding the spasming muscle, putting pressure on it, and forcing it to relax (so his being tense is exactly why you would do it).  It would probably be a good idea for you to do some research to find out more about it before you do it, or maybe you could find a therapeutic masseuse who would be willing to treat your dog.<br>  I have had therapeutic massage, myself, so I already knew how it worked.

If not then check the water quality and since u have mentioned that its a new setup tank, have you done the tank cycling(research it on net). Conduct partial water changes when ever u feel its necessary.|`|aeonmRR2aa	That's normal.  Goldfish like to rest near the bottom of the tank, preferably under something, when they are 'asleep'.  Mine do it too.<br>  <br>  I built a little bridge or 'henge' out of 3 granite slabs, and several of them like to huddle together there at night.  It makes them feel safe from predators, and also the dead area of current makes it easier for them to stay in one place while resting.<br>  <br>  You might want to build them a couple more places like that, using coconut shells, terra-cotta flower pots, and so forth.  Sometimes it takes them a couple weeks to trust the new spot.
oHGEw2BCaa	Cats are territorial by nature--specially of their owners....As are dogs. The best thing would be to show your cats patience and extra care. <br>  <br>  Your kitties need to explore, as they are curious by nature. Find out on their own that your new puppy is not a threat. They'll probably circle the pup, watch it from a safe distant until they realize he's only being playful. <br>  <br>  Your puppy will most likely be interested in the new felines as well, and might try to play with them as well. Something your cats might be warry of and might react aggressively. So the best thing is to remove the pup and set him a few feet away where he wont reach the cats. You're cats will keep a close eye on him but wont attack after a few days.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11589437	A baby chihuahua would look a lot like a mouse or sth., and you know what cats do to mice, right?<br>  <br>  BTW, if they find out it is a dog, I don't think that will so any good to his defense either.<br>   <br>  So never let them alone together.|`|bORXhan0aa	Just watch out for the cats cause they can harm your poor chihuahua  if they double team but with good supervision your pets should be fine..|`|sdOMcaI9aa	I don't think they want to hurt him so much as find out who/what he is.

We found him as a very scrawny lost kitten at roughly 4-5 months. After 4-6 weeks of eating anything that moved he suddenly started vomiting one night and became very lethargic (very strange for Rommel). I was worried about what to do and "ummed and ahhed" for a while and did some internet research. In the end I called my vets 24hr line for peace of mind, they talked through the symptoms and were happy for him to come in the next day.<br>   As it turned out he had a severe worm infestation that was blocking his gut/bowel.<br>   DON'T take this as advice of what could be wrong with you cat, call them asap. It could be something worse.

ur5wDhkMaa	Gourami are rather like Betta in temperament and they don't like company. 60 litres is roughly 12 UK gallon which is too small for these fish. Gold is just a variant of Opaline/3 spot, they are exactly the same species.<br>  <br>  You may have two males in which case that's a guaranteed fight to the death, but the males will attack females that invade their territory outside of breeding purposes. A male will claim 20 UK gallon as its own, so as he has grown, he's become rattier tempered.<br>  <br>  Best I can suggest is find new homes for both and replace with a pair of dwarfs, which are nowhere near as stroppy as the bigger ones. The trouble is they are easy to breed in the right conditions and therefore cheap to buy, but Opaline's are only a community fish when they aren't bigger than the rest of their tank mates.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	I'm guessing their both males, right? You cannot keep 2 male gouramis together, they will fight for dominance and territory.|`|a60QJhm9aa	Try seperating them.|`|3iTmXKImaa	hi, this is not fact only what has happened to us, we had 3 gourami at one time and the two bigger ones used to bully the other one quite a bit, chasing it away from food and nipping at it so he used to just mooch around at the back of the tank. we mentioned it to fish shop who said we could take him back and swap him even though we had had him for several months as it was not fair on him. however when we got home he was floating :( he had been swimming about but quite a bit slower, so not sure if it was because he had not got enough food. <br>  i would recommend speaking to your pet shop cos they were willing to take ours back for his own sake, we got ours from pets at home.<br>  <br>  now we only have the 2 larger gourami and loads of other fish which all seem very happy :) good luck!|`|e27a0140d6c769e130a863ab1952f2b9aa	The Gouramis are having dominance issues.  I have raised many gouramis with some success.  I have even bred gold gouramis.  First, you should provide territory for each fish.  Depending on what you have to decorate your tank with, you can arrange it so that the fish have zones to swim in.  In other words, you can use rocks, plants, flowerpots, etc. to break up open space and give fish places to hide or to hold out in.  I have several caves and many large plants that break up my 30gallon tank.  You could add a 4" (10cm) pot or two to give caves for fish to make a home in, or you could put a few pieces of slate in the tank and create more natural looking cave or tunnel formations for all of your fish to enjoy.  Rearranging these things from time to time helps to shake up the pecking order in a fish tank.  It has been suggested by experts to rearrange decorations in a tank especially when adding new fish to an established community.  It gives each fish equal footing in the race to mark out their territory.  If none of this works, then identify what sex the fish are.  Gourami males tend to have more pronounced dorsal and anal fins with the dorsal fin coming to a defined point.  Female gouramis have small dorsal and anal fins and the dorsal fin is rounded.  Same sex gouramis will be aggressive towards each other.  Males moreso than females.  So if you have gouramis of the same sex, you can try to trade one out for the opposite sex fish.<br>  <br>  If none of the above works, then try to find a home for one of the gouramis.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.
yffVmSMaaa	The other advice given about using the published references for a begnning point is good.<br>  <br>  My practice, as a point in reference, is this: My mildly active, middle-aged, 35# (16kg) border-mutt gets 1.5 cups (dry) kibble a day, split into two meals. Training treats are subtracted from that amount on a 1-for-1 basis. That is, if I wind up giving her a 1/4 cup of treats in a day, she gets 1.25 cups of kibble, instead of 1.5. I usually pre-measure the day's food, and subtract a fair bit from the evening measurement for training treats - Whatever I don't use just gets put back into the evening meal.<br>  <br>  Check your dog's body fat by running your hands gently down his ribs; you should be able to feel his ribs under a sheet of muscle and hide, but they should not be too obvious. If you have to press to find them, then you need to cut back a bit on the food. If the ribs are too obvious, then you need to increase the meals just a bit. I check Suka's tone this way daily - I'm petting her anyway, so why not make that an opportunity to give her a good once-over looking for burrs, matts, the condition of her feet and teeth, and her over-all weight and health, too?|`|71i6IjdZaa	Im not sure exactly, sorry:)<br>  <br>  Please answer mine anyone?

A dogs stomach is 1.5 times bigger than its paw.<br>  <br>  I would be feeding roughly 1/2 to 3/4 of a can of dog meat (the standard size cans, not those extra large ones) with 1/2 cup of biscuits at night, and 1 1/2 cups of dry biscuits in the morning. Depending whether your dog is a nibble eater or a guts. My puppy is a guts so I dont feed him too much.<br>  <br>  You have to remember a dogs stomach is like a big conveyor... it goes in and straight back out again. So remember to feed your dog good quality food so it gets all the nutrients from its meal.<br>  <br>  If you are unsure, and think your dog is overweight I would see a vet and they can prescribe a diet better suited for your dog.|`|O6nXUnx2aa	It really depends on how much exercise he is getting daily, the more exercise the more he needs to eat. I would say give your vet a call or stop in and they will tell you how much your dog should be eating. The recommended daily amount is 3.5 to 4 cups of dry kibble daily. But like I said it depends on the size, metabolism, activity level, age and whether or not they need to gain or loose weight.|`|3FmcSiMkaa	The best thing to do is read on the food bag or the food's website because it depends on the type of food you're feeding him and each brand is different.

JBPsePnwaa	I agree with everyone you need a trainer.  I do have a tip for you.  Don't feed the older one first, feed them at the same time but first you must pretend you are eating the food, and they must see you do it.  This makes you the alpha, and puts them on equal ground.  The alpha always eats first, and she may be challenging Shooters authority.  If you are the alpha, she may be more settled with him.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	I suggest you have a private trainer or behaviorist come to your home to help you. Your vet should be able to refer you or go to www.apdt.com or www.iaabc.org. Until then, put the puppy in her crate when you prepare their food and feed her there. Don't allow Elllie out until Shooter has finished and she has calmed down.|`|vIYGV1C7aa	Feed them seperately until you can get the aggression under control.

Now, as for the puppy. Put a leash on the dog. make the puppy sit and stay while you fill the bowl. If the dog goes crazy, make her sit and wait for her to settle. You, walk over and place the food bowl down while the pup is still sitting where you left her (you may need a person to help) lead her to the food. As she is eating, pet her. The moment she growls or tenses up, take her away and make her sit away from the food. Keep repeating while getting more intrusive (hand in her bowl while eating) You need to reinforce that you are the boss. It will reinforce that aggression is not OK and if she wants to eat that is not acceptable behavior. I always make my Husky sit until I tell her to "get it".

Prices vary as the costs that breeders have invested that they have to cover vary.<br>  <br>  How big they grow depends on the genetics of the lines the dog was bred from.  The standard for the breed states that the dogs are "not to exceed 7 pounds."  So if you obtain a dog from an ethical breeder, breeding to adhere to the standard, it should be under 7 pounds as an adult.  Unfortunately, the popularity of the breed has brought forth many irresponsible breeders so there are many non-standard Yorkies being produced.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	If you're interested in small breeds I suggest you get a book on small breeds or go talk to people at the pet shop, breeders or even strike up a quick convo with local dog owners.<br>  <br>  Every breed has it's strong and weak points and you may find if you are a first time owner that the Yorkie's nature is too strong willed for you to begin to tackle. <br>  <br>  I recommend you bare in mind that price isn't always an indicator of a good, healthy dog.

vIYGV1C7aa	You are going to have to walk him...a lot!  Going from a yard to being trapped (from his point of view) inside a small apartment, is a big change.

If it were me, I'd try taking him out for a walk with some playing to excercise him before leaving him - assuming you don't leave for work at 4 am like I do (that makes it a little more difficult).  If that doesn't work, you could keep him in a kennel cage while you're out.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	That's actually not an apartment kinda dog. He definitely needs to be walked as much as possible. I would walk him an hour in the morning and night. Take him to an off leash park if you can. Buy an extended leash and take him to a local park to play. Get ready to run with him! I lived in an apartment with my hound and found it hard. You may want to get a baby gate and block him into one room to stop him from destroying everything. He is way too hyper for a crate. I would buy kongs and give him one before leaving. Their great because they distract the dog and give him hours of something to do. Freezing it helps. I swear by kongs. I fill mine with cheeze whiz because my dog doesn't like peanut butter.LOL. A laser pointer is also fun to get him running around ouside or even in the apartment. (my neighbour hated me). Dogs love routine. Get him on one, and it should get easier. Just be patient and remember he relys on you everytime he needs to go to the bathroom. You will get fustrated, but its worth every second. Good Luck

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	By just letting her go outside by herself you are teaching her nothing.<br>  You need to go out with her and stay with her.  Repeat a word you are comfortable with such as 'potty' and when she obliges throw a very enthusiatic praise party so she knows she has done what you want her to do.  Give her a treat and tell her what a good girl she is.<br>  <br>  Take her out every couple of hours because she has not yet learnt she needs to hold her bowels and bladder.  Start off as though she was a baby puppy until she gets the idea.  You should also get up at least once during the night to take her outside.<br>  <br>  There is no point in getting impatient.  3 weeks is nothing and really you haven't taught her anything in the past 3 weeks.   It usually takes at least 3 months to train a baby puppy and with the babies we need to go outside with them every hour and at least 2 or 3 times during the night.  You have it easy!!!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that she doesn't know what you want until you actively teach her and you haven't been doing that. If you keep an eye on her you will learn to read the signs she gives when she needs to go out. You will also get to know her timetable i.e. how long after a meal she needs to be taken outside and how regularly she needs to go.<br>  <br>  Stick strictly to a regime and she will catch on in no time.  Then, and only then, can you let her go outside on her own because she will have learned what is expected of her.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	crate train her at night.dogs don't like to pee were they sleep my dog never had an accident.<br>  also tell her off when she does it in the house and put her in the garden where she is supposed to go.my pup was trained in 1 week and i never used any other method before|`|cpeA9fdwaa	just keep trying, and over the long months of trying, it will learn. it took me a while with our black lab but now it's the best dog ever. just do your best on teaching it, and it'll come sooner then u think.|`|HggDyPnYaa	Crate training is the best method if you’re finding difficulty in keeping an I on your pup. a dog will not mess in its own bed keep it in the cage and take it outside every hour give a command word like busy and give it 10 mins if dose not do anything take it straight back to its cage if it dose do its business reward him with a treat and let him have half an hour run around the house and he will soon get the picture as he progresses give him longer playing and try two hours in the cage ,its a must that you do NOT get up during the night to let him out or you will end up with a dog crying to be out all night for the rest of its life hope it all goes well for you any more information just mail liam  <br>   p.s dogs will need to go to do there business after eating waking up and sometimes after getting themselves excited running around look out for them doing circles and sniffing the floor.
cnZlMojUaa	I'm a little confused by your question, but it sounds like you lost your beloved dog. I am so sorry for your loss. The only way to know for sure what the cause of death was is to have a vet perform a necropsy (animal autopsy). I'm not sure if I would be up to that while dealing with my grief. You don't give the age of your dog, but I do have a suspicion since I saw very similar issues with my little dog who passed a few months ago. She died from kidney failure.<br>  <br>  When the kidneys are failing, the dog can't filter the poisons from its body. This causes the dog to lose its appetite. They will vomit. Since they can't eat and are very sick, they get very weak and lethargic. Some dogs may develop stomach ulcers with kidney failure and this could be a source of blood in the stool. I did see this, but my dog got her ulcers from a cancer medication that caused the kidney failure. Kidney failure is often seen in older dogs, although younger dogs can face this through poisoning. <br>  <br>  Know there are other things that could cause the conditions you saw in your dog, but you may wish to research acute kidney failure and chronic kidney failure and see if this sounds like what your dog experienced. I am so sorry for your loss. It is a very hard road. When you feel up to it, please consider visiting www.petloss.com. It is a safe, comforting place for those mourning their pets.|`|roQPtGccaa	Probably something it ate.|`|l2T4TrN6aa	Most likely parvovirus. Those are the symptoms. My dog began having those symptoms just 3 days ago. I rushed her to the vet, found out she had parvo, and she died today. It's very serious, so the sooner you get your dog to the vet the better.|`|1udEuMilaa	The most accurate way to find out what symtoms ur dog has is to have a vet complete an autopsies|`|X4umNoGzaa	Sound like parvo. very serious.|`|hJZWMkFZaa	can be food poisning
ZN686EhIaa	I cook apple slices in a tiny bit of water in the microwave (650 watt 3mins approx). Mash up the slices to a pulp, mix with soggy bran and finely grated carrot. Makes very squishy balls that need to be carried in cling wrap. Doesn't clog in the horse, but breaks up instantly in the mouth. One medium apple and one largish carrot make about six little balls (ping pong size). Only feed one ball though. Does contain natural sugars (the apple).|`|LzXZQBHbaa	You just listed everything that would make a horse treat yummy to the horse.

wLgGD63raa	You really need to be doing quite a bit of research before you just go and pick up an animal. If you have no idea what something needs to survive, then you should really be soaking in the information. That being said, here is an excellent care sheet to refer to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgecko.com/emcare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgecko.com/emcare.html</a><br>  <br>  Now with -that- being said, Leo's are insectivores (they eat insects), and therefore, they can eat crickets, mealworms, locusts, superworms (etc.), waxworms (as a treat, only 1-2 times a month!), and pinky mice (ONLY breeding females after she has laid eggs!). Crickets and mealworms are the most common food items and almost all pet stores carry them. I (and my Leo) prefer mealworms, because they can be kept right in a shallow dish inside the tank, and they last much longer than a dozen or so crickets. One thing you want to remember is: get insects that are smaller than your geckos head, for easier digestion. It's not fun trying to eat something that doesn't fit into your mouth comfortably.<br>  <br>  There are a number of other things you need to provide for your gecko, and you can read more about these things and everything else with the care sheet I have provided for you. Here are a couple of other websites that you may find helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard-gecko-food-and-diet/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard-gecko-cages-and-habitat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard-geck-health-illness/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgeckoguide.com/leopard...</a>|`|sUN7TVtzaa	you need to do some serious research before even looking at one to buy these will help you out if they don't work then google leopard gecko care sheet<br>  <a href="http://leopardgeckopunk.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgeckopunk.com</a><br>  <a href="http://leopardgecko.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgecko.com</a><br>  <a href="http://celbritygeckos.com" rel="nofollow">http://celbritygeckos.com</a><br>  not sure if they will all work but try them and do more reasearch!!!!!!!<br>  i reasearched for about two months before we got ours. good luck!|`|niGAKJT4aa	crickets, meal worms, wax worms, maggots....really any kind of small insect.  you will want to get some calcium powder and follow the directions, they lose bone density rapidly and easily.
uBFhKXgHaa	A high quality one.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/</a> (RawFed)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com/</a> (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)<br>  <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rawfeddogs.net/</a> (Raw Fed Dogs)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawmeatybones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawmeatybones.com/</a> (Raw Meaty Bones)<br>  <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html</a> (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

Most good breeders give a new owner a small supply of the food they use.  Switching feed abruptly, especially with puppies, causes tummy upsets so if you can get back to her breeder and ask what she was reared on, this would be best.<br>  <br>  After that, you can gradually switch her to something you prefer, if necessary.

fa9748c40c199ddcc992893789d07695aa	As bad as this may sound, honestly, it is unusual for rodents to give birth to only one. She might have had more, realized they were sick, and ate them. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but it does happen. I have had mice, etc all of my life, and this happens a lot. The remaining baby might be sick, and if so the same may have happened to it. Nature takes care of itself though, so maybe its better, as it could have been very sick.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I do hope it is alive though.|`|I6KKFwxXaa	if you are concerned then yes just lift and look do not touch as mom may not take care of the baby. Also if it is first time mom she may have not known how to care for baby properly and if you find it passed on then do not be surprised if she chewed head. Sorry to say and really trying not to be to graphic or traumatize you but it is part of nature for them and she also needs calcium and protein more so now in her diet.|`|aMAhwCTBaa	Just lift it and make sure its alive because if its dead then it will start to stink so you really need to check it out.|`|pvrLSTZzaa	If she is a first time mom she probably ate them. It sounds like the baby is dead. At 11 days she should be exploring the cage. There is nothing wrong with checking.|`|lj8nVLL4aa	Well hamsters do not peep chicks do .  so you probably will never hear a peep from the cage.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	I'd wait a few more days. Safer to investigate at the two week mark when the pups are likely to have more fur. It's also a good time to clean the cage.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about a dead pup in the cage; mom will have eaten it. It's extremely rare for a hamster to leave a dead one in the cage. In the wild, this would attract predators. Eating the dead babies, also lets mom recoup some of those nutrients.<br>  <br>  As another poster said, its unlikely she gave birth to just one. Common sense advice, you never breed a hamster again that has lost a litter. There's always a reason for the loss.<br>  <br>  No one has yet offered up the correct way to actually check.on the pup when the time comes. The general rule of thumb is that mom never sees you with the pups.<br>  <br>  Take mom out, put in another cage.<br>  Take babies out, put somewhere else. Let them crawl into a tube or something if you're really worried about touching them and mom rejecting them.<br>  Clean cage quickly. Since you only have one pup, you do want to make this fast.<br>  Put babies back in first.<br>  Put mom back in.<br>  <br>  She may freak out a bit. Some will carry the babies around the cage even. The best thing to do is leave her alone to settle down. If you make the mistake of trying to "rescue" the baby, you're just going to cause her more stress and make settling in take longer.|`|BPrsFXk2aa	Investigate...  Just be cautious not to touch the baby.
