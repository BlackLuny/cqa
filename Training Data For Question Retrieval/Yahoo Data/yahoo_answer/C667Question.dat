When I meet my partner he was chasing me for a long time to be honest I didnt want to go there but he grew on me as he seem to be very sweet for a while. He was keeping a secret though..... He gambles! Weve been togeather for 7 years now and through out this time he has promised he would stop. Attitude is easy to tell that he has done something or is about to do something. Well tonight he says he has gone to a friends house but i saw him drive off the other way! not towards his friends house but towards another friends house! this friend of his is goung through a divorce because he is having an affair. Im affraid that he is influencing my partner. Im the only one who is bringing any money into this house and I feel he takes the mick with me!

Well he works for British Airways, and can get me a free ticket (and upgrades) aslong as he is on the same flight (working).      Hes invited me to come with him for 5 days to Shanghai.

20090304124238AAdmFfd	Family & Relationships;Family	I think my god brother hates me?	Ok, I'll try to keep this short for you guys.  I have only sisters and I'm the oldest out of all of them.  I have one god brother that I consider my real brother, because we were so close.  The thing is when I was little he used to call me up to his room and ask me if I wanted to watch something nasty.  It was actually porn, but I didn't know that when I was younger.  I used to watch it with him.  My mom found out and forbid me to ever see him again which hurt me and made a lot of sense at the same time.  I have not talked to him since.  But recently I looked up his name on myspace and added him as a friend.  I e-mailed him to see if he remembered me, he answered yes and then asked how I've been.  After I responded he pretty much never said anything back to me.  I know it can be annoying but I've always wanted an older brother to talk to and be friends with.  So I check up on him every once and a while to see what he's up to.  All he says is sup.  It's led me to think that he thinks that I did something wrong or he's mad at me for some reason.  Does he hate me or am I just going mad.  I forgot to mention that I have not seen him in I don't know how long.  But the last time I remember seeing him was when I was at my god mom's house for my sisters birthday.  He spoke.  I think that was about 3 years ago.  I don't consider that even contact at all so the last time I really saw him and spent time with him was when I was about 6 maybe.  What should I do?
20090304124505AAHQeL0	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I get over being angry and ready to hurt something?	My mother told me that I was materialistic.  I was so angry and frustrated because when I asked her what she meant and what she suggest me do to stop me becoming materialistic she told me that she had a headache from me and could you please not speak anymore.     If she doesn't want me to ask, then she shouldn't have said anything.   I think that even if she thought I was acting materialistic, I feel that it is something like maybe a stress reliever.  Thinking and wanting material things makes me feel calmer or even kind of happy, you know?      so i want you to give me your options and your answers
20090304124405AAnvuL3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Depressing problem with boyfriend?	My boyfriend of almost six years (6)  has stopped talking to me over me refusing to give him access to my grades online.  (i am in college and graduating in June).  I feel that its not his concern to see, and I have gotten C's B's and some Ds (2) because I was struggling with some things including something I am getting attention for now (I may have adult ADD but thats a totally different issue)        I dont want to be judged for my grades and so I told him all he needs to know really is that I am graduating soon and planning to get some work experience then apply to graduate school after I have some experience to back up my application.        this week when I call,even to offer him lunch or to see if he got the gift/card i left in his car for him (just to let him know i was thinking about him and a card to say im sorry that we're fighting i want to work through this)  he refused to answer if he even got it and said "do you have the info?" (my login info) and he when i said no he hung up on me at least a dozen times this has happened that week.   We have had a good relationship and been together a long time. he doesnt always tell me info either, but thinks im required to give it to him.        i told him the main reason i refuse is because i dont want an ultimatum like this put over my head. im lost on what to do. he is not answering the phone, last night was the last time i got the hang up routine and he wont answer today at all.       suggestions?  i had a full blown anxiety attack yesterday from stressing out from this and im just shocked he is doing this.
20090304124053AAwQrog	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did I overreact, or was it just a dumb thing to do ?	Yesterday me and my best friend (ex-girlfriend) went to the mall because she wanted to put some clothes on hold and pick them back up on Friday when she was leaving to go out of town for her b-day..We got in the mall and she said oh I forgot my shoes in the car can you go get them..and she said that she wanted to take them back and get money for them, because she is going to need as much money as possible for this weekend (she doesn't have a job)..I mean it kind of hurt my feelings since I bought her those shoes for v-day and she said how much she liked them and how no one else has those, but she said they were tight on her feet (she told me to get a size 9 or 9.5 I got a 9) she was asking me what should she do take them back or get a bigger size (my plan was to give her money on her b-day anyway) I was like it's up to you..I got the sneakers out the car and tried to return them but they were creased, and they could tell they were worn before, so pretty much I felt like I wasted 90.00 on a v-day present..she could of tried the shoes on at home to see if they were tight on her foot, instead of going to school an entire day then deciding they were too tight...She told me sorry, and she would wear them anyway, but it just hurt and I didn't say anything else to her for the rest of the night, I dish out a good bit of money for her( which I'm sure she appreciates I guess) (July she was $60 short for a phone I gave it to her..January $105 short..and the phone she just got cut on $100 I helped her pay (which she says she'll pay back, but I just said it's fine) I didn't even add in money I just gave to her or gas money..I just gave her 130.00 to help get her hair done on Friday, plus I told her that she didn't have to pay her half of the phone bill this month so she could buy the hair she needed to get her micro braids done (43.00)..She kept saying that it wasn't a big deal since she was still going to wear them..But I feel like it isn't a big deal for her because she isn't paying for it. That 90.00 could of stayed in my pocket easily..But I wanted to help her out since she always wanted me to buy her sneakers anyway, and I understood her situation about her mom being a single mother and my friend not having a job..But to me it is a big deal I could of gave that money to my mom for bills or something..all she got me on v-day was some balloons because her mom said that since we aren't dating the guy should really be buying the stuff, after the fact me and her agreed to get each other something..But I don't know this is just too much stress for me..I'm only 18...if you look at my profile I have TONS and tons of questions asking about what should I do about this "relationship"..I'm tired of it..her 18th birthday is tomorrow so I'll call her @ 11:59 tonight and tell her happy b-day out of respect.. but other than that I'm done..What do you think ? I just wanted to reassure myself..times like this I always feel like it's my fault..

20090304125635AAKWzfa	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should i marry my fiance if she lied to me?	Well, something happened between me and my fiance yesterday night while we were talking. We decided to tell each other all our lies and secrets before getting married. I ended up telling her that i slept with her best friend before we started to date. She actually already knew that, but i lied to her it only happened once. The truth was that it happened several times, but i never felt anything for her. I only used her to waste time. Anyway, after hearing that she also confessed she had lied to me as well. She had also slept with a friend while we were dating. Actually she had been having sex with this guy for while, before she even met me. The guy wanted her to move in with him, but she never wanted nothing more from him and used him for company when she was alone. Anyway i understand if he slept with the guy before she met me. The thing that has me angry is that she slept with him while we first started going out. We werent really boyfriend and girlfriend, but im used pissed off about that. She says she slept with him because me and her werent really serious then and just started to go out. Im also pissed she lied about this when i asked her way back. SHe said she never slept wth him and never went beyond kisses. I know i lied to her as well. But my actions were before i ever met her.       Anyway, i love her with all my heart. Im just scared that she will break my heart in the future. Not just because of this. But she told me how she was single she used to date a lot of guys, and sometimes even at the same time. She even had two abortions from two guys. I accepted all of that since it happened before she met me. She even changed her number for me and let me rip all her photos wth her past boyfriends and phonenumbers. She hasnt cheated on me since we got serious and has done everything that i asked. She has an 8 year old daughter that i have grown atatched to. She has promised me she will never ever cheat on me, but she also said if i ever cheated on her she would do the same.       So, i need opinions. Should i follow my heart. Or do you guys think she will cheat on me?
20090304125635AAkxwp5	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i convince my friends parents?	My friend and I want to go to Chicago in November to go to this convention. We live in New York and are 16.

We are already preparing to talk to them on Friday when I go to her house and we plan on having all the information, like driving, hotels, and etc.       What are some other ways we can convince them to say yes?
20090304125524AA322fO	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do in this situation?	My friend and I started carpooling a couple of weeks ago.   My car wasn't working anymore and they raised the price of parking at my friend's job. As a solution, my friend would get me, I'd drop her off, I would then drive the car about a mile and then park by my work because our parking is free in our building. We split the gas and it would benefit the both of us. I would have a way to work and my friend would not have to pay $17 a day for parking.       Recently she has started taking several fitness classes after work 2-4 nights a week. She can't park at her gym, because, you guessed it, they also charge to park. She will get done anywhere from 3-4 hours after work. By that time I am at home and spending time with my children. At first I would pick her up from the gym since it was her car. Now she expects it all the time. Lately I left it by the sitter's house, a mutual friend of ours. After work she would either get a ride to the gym or take public transportation and do the same to get home or to our friend's house. I did this because I explained that I could not get her that late. She was fine and said to leave it by our friend's.    Apparently, instead of telling me that the situation isn't working, she has bad mouthed me to our circle of friends. She tells them I take her for granted and that I should realize she is helping me.       So, I ask, am I wrong here?   This was not a part of our agreement. Should I have to pick her up?   And secondly should I not be angry my friends are approaching me with this and not her?

I have just stumbled upon the fact that my boyfriend has a long term porn addiction. From what I found, I know it is something that has been going on for many years and that he knows it is an addiction. I really need honest opinions from genuine porn addicts themselves. Please help with any or all questions.       -Does he know that he is depriving us of intimacy (he says he has a low drive right now) or just covering for his mistress (porn)?   -Does looking at so many different women make you do something worse like cheating in real life?   -Can you truly love another person?   -By looking at so many young airbrushed girls and videos, does looking at a partner sicken you b/c they are not that way?   -Do you love it more than your partner or do you feel guilty?

Well we both love each other very much i at least know that. But i know that there is a difference in loving someone and being in love with someone. My question is if he says he loves me why wont he let me into his heart? He says he loves me, but he blocks me out and doesnt let me in. Why? Why does he say he loves me if he wont let me in? I have talked to him bout it some, and he says hes not ready to give up his heart. In his past his girlfriends treated him like **** and broke his heart he's had it broken 3 times. Is it bad that i hate them so much for what they did to him? Well i the beginning it was great, but the more serious our relationship got the more he started to be distant from me. Im so confused, He’s told me that im the only girl for him and that he loved me and that I had his heart. We talked about a lot of stuff, lately we have been talking about serious stuff.  Lately hes been actin strange like he’s changed Ive noticed little things that have changed and you know I asked him about it and he said he was confused now. I dont know what he is goin through right now, but he is confusing me so much, i dont want to lose him, i love him with all my heart. What do i do? Why is he actin this way? Im not gona hurt him. I could never hurt him. I dont know hoe to act around him now. Help me out please....

20090304125210AASd41i	Family & Relationships;Family	Will my Grandmother ever be able to talk again?	My grandmother was about to go out, when she had a stroke.       She had her life alert button, but it didn't work. She lives out of town, so no one came to her house for 3 days. She just laid there for 3 days.      Someone finally found her and she was tooken to the hospital.       Right now, about a little over a week since the whole thing - She can't talk. She can say No, and a couple of other words. She's very sharp on what's going out, but she just can't get the words out. We were trying to find out a building or something that was in our town 50 years ago and she knew but she couldn't tell us. She got so mad. Her hands weren't working then so she couldn't write it. We finally figured it out though, she's very keen still.      It's just so sad trying to see her talk, she makes high pitched "chirps". And she looks so sad.       In this situation, will she ever get her voice back? I couldn't even imagine living like that. She's 96 years old.      And could her family sue Life line or whatever it is? They tested the batteries in it, and they were full. They said it was 'Defected' but it wasn't when she bought it - She had to test it out. I know it's not top priority, but they deserve it. They should test their products before they go in the hands of elderly which their life depends on. That's ridiculous.

He thinks that I am bringing our problems in to our relationship because I attract them.  He says that I like to start fights and that's why we can't get along.   He thinks he's better than me know that he read that book,  I am learning the secret my self, I just started to read the book.   Do you people think, he's taking it too far.   This are some of the things I do on a daily basis, I don't think I'm that bad.      Wake up at 4 am and make him breakfast.   Stay up and clean the house a little, make him lunch and get my kids ready for school.   Drive them to school(30 minute commute)   Go to an 8 hour office job.   Come home take my shoes off, start cooking dinner.   Clean up the house, do laundry, trash out, ect.   Make sure my kids shower and read with the little one for 30 min.   Tuck them in to bed by 9pm.   Tuck him in... ya know.   Go to bed to wake up and do it all over again.      Plus I sell Avon and he expects me to fit in 1 1/2 hours of work out at the gym.

I said "Are you suree this is such a good idea" and he said "I really wanna though..."   He's a nice guy and stuff, not good looking but nice, and it was sorta my fault that he thinks I like him. He kept saying things like "I'm so glad we're gonna be more than friends...." etc. He asked what I'd say if he asked me out...and I said probs yes cause I didn't wanna be mean. Grr I don't like him, but it was my screw up so should I give him a chance anyway?      I know this was a shitty thing for me to do. But at first, it was boosting his confidence and he seemed so much happier! I didn't anticipate this to happen....
20090304131759AAiBbnm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When someone tells you their marriage is a facade, what are the chances it will last?	A friend of mine has admitted that he is putting on a show and being who he needs to be for his family's sake.  His biggest reasons for staying in his marriage are his children, which I find admirable, and because he has worked very hard to be in the position he is in and he doesn't want to lose it (financially).  It is evident that while their marriage is functional it is empty.  She does not act affectionately toward him either.  If you are wondering, no we are not having an affair.  We have been very good friends for many years and respect each other too much to begin a relationship under those circumstances.  That being said, if their marriage ever ended things would be different.  I am not waiting for it or even hoping for it, because I think that marriage deserves a fighting chance, but I wonder if it is likely to happen.  I mean, how long can someone stand to live an empty life before they both say enough?

Our Brother Nate is out of town with his wife Heather (Hopefully making us a niece. lol.) anyway Jack is out of control. He colored on the walls this morning and bit one of his classmates yesterday. Nate told us to spank him if he misbehaved   The only problem is neither of us have ever spanked before, i mean we've been spanked but we weren't exactly taking notes!! SO if a parent could please help us we'd greatly appreciate it!       Thanks....

20090304131015AAwf8oW	Family & Relationships;Family	Do You Think A 12-Year-Old Boy Should Sleep Beside His Mom in HER Bed?	A good friend of mine is going thru a NASTY custody battle with his ex-wife.  The court has granted the ex-wife temporary custody while they are battling it out...   She admitted to the court that 3 of the 4 boys sleep in her livingroom (size 10 x 10) on a sofa, recliner and the floor, because she lives in a 1 bedroom home (my friend has a 4 bedroom home!) but what the court DOESN'T yet know is that the youngest boy, age 12, sleeps next to his mother in HER bed every night (my friend just found this out!)      So, America... I'd like YOUR opinion :)      Do YOU think it's "okay" for a 12-year-old boy to be sleeping beside his mother in her bed every night?      We are just looking for public opinion on this subject... whether you think it IS okay or NOT okay.      Thanks!

Her wedding is in May 18, 2008 around 8pm.  If I go to the wedding I may not get the job which I really  need.  She went to my wedding and I would feel guilty not going.  I'm thinking of maybe throwing her a small reception in Dallas (where she lives) but I don't have too much money. I could spend like $500 or something around that. I'm also afraid she'll be upset at me. What do you recommend?

20090304141828AACQoTE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Yes or no: Does she like me?	All right let me break this down for you.      I like this girl whose been friends with me for a good year, but we havent talked to each other for about 2 months, and im just starting to briefly keep in contact with her.      Anyway, Im starting to think she likes me back, and these are the reasons why:      1. She hated that I liked her close friend, she always told me that we wouldnt go together and that she was too slutty and too much of a party girl for me. She was the first to tell me that the girl I used to like (her close friend) chopped her hair off and got her braces back on (dont worry im in high school).      2. She confronted my other friend who i've been friends with since diapers, and asked her if me and her were going out - oddly enough Ive never talked to this friend around her, so I don't even know how she found out we were friends.      3. She talks about guys she likes around me, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who she tells and I'm not her absolute best friend. She puts me in hypothetical situations involving guys she thinks are hot or cute or w/e, but mostly doesnt admit to liking them - or admits to liking them in the past.      4. She noticed that I started being friends with this other girl (who I still never mentioned and never talked to infront of her) and one time this guy who liked my new friend went up to the girl I like and said "whats with him does he like her?" and the girl I like responded "uhh i definately think he likes her" in a really sad tone im told. The fact that she even could have thought that from rarely even seeing us first hand is a bit suprising.      5. In a more recent conversation she said that she missed me, that we should hang out soon, and randomly asked if I liked anyone new.      6. She said im "one of the funniest people shes ever met", even though everyone else would say I'm not that funny, and im not a goof or a clown either.      I really like her and I think we could be pretty awesome together - i could go on and on about how i like her but Ill save u guys the trouble, even though Ive always wanted to tell her i liked her from day one and it hurts to hold it in.      So do you think she likes me?
20090304135947AAYkR6X	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister broke my camera!!!!?	My sister is taking this photography class, so I let her borrow my camera for 2 weeks. The first day, she broke it!!! I tried asking her how it broke, but all she did was start crying. I told my mom, and she was just like "Let it go, let it go! It's not that big of a deal." It is that big of a deal to me! I love taking pictures and videos. I bought that camera with my own money, too! I know that if the tables were turned,               I wouldn't hear the end of it ( my sister is a drama queen). Do I have the right to be this upset??? Or should I take my mom's advice and let it go?       Btw, I'm usually not this angry. I'm not a complainer.      Helpful suggestions would be appreciated.

20090304141638AAwvWHS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you spend your average day with your spouse?	I guess it's becoming clear to me that my husband and myself do not conduct ourselves like most married couples, and I'd just like information on how YOU and your spouse spend your days?      Please include:   Your ages   How long you've been married   Do you spend most of your time together?   If you're both home, are you TOGETHER or doing separate things?   Do you go to bed together?   Are you affectionate?   How's your sex life?      -About me:  My husband and I have been married for 2 years.  I'm 24, he's 29.  We spend almost all of our free time together.  Every couple weeks we will get together with friend without each other for a couple of hours, but typically our time is spent together.  When we are both home, we are doing things together.  We watch shows together, or play games together, or just talk.  We go to bed TOGETHER every night, and we are very affectionate.  We do cuddle every night before sleeping, and show affection by hugging/kissing multiple times a day.  We have sex multiple times a week, and the quality is good.  Just looking to see how other couples compare, on average!

20090304140817AAHW9bI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I have apologized to her or...?	Okay, I am seventeen.  My girlfriend is normally a very quiet and sweet girl, and she means so much to me.  A couple of weeks ago, though, we got into a really big fight at a party of a mutual friend. She said that I never gave her any attention and was too busy flirting around with her friends.   This isn't true.  She and I both screamed some really hurtful things at each other, and it ended with me telling her that she didn't mean anything to me (again, untrue) and her leaving in tears.  Today was the first day that we've spoken to each other since, and it seemed to be going well.  Then, just as I thought we were getting somewhere, she asked if I was going to apologize.  I felt like this was kind of a shot at me, so I told her that I refused to apologize.  Well, this led to another argument, and I was wondering: was I wrong for not apologizing?  And am I horrible person for what I yelled at her?

My boyfriend came home one day with a letter that said his feelings where not like they where when we first met and basicly said it was over. I still love him but he shows no affection. We still go places and do things together just like before but he sleeps on the couch and I am suppose to be finding a place to live. We still live in the same house but different beds. I have told him how I feel but he just says his feelings have not changed. What do I do he does not talk about his feelings.  We where together over a year before this happened and no there is no one else I am sure of it.

But before we started dating I liked one of my best guy friends, and I knew he sort of liked me, but nothing happened. So now that I am dating someone else, he is acting really clingy and keeps telling me to break up with him. He calls me when he knwos I am with my boyfriend and makes plans to hang out with me one on one and calls me to have long conversations. He had never done this before.

20090304134355AAmbMIx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Insecure girlfriend stressing me out, making me change for worse.  Help!?	I have been dating a girl for about 3 months.  She is smart, nice, sweet and really attractive, however she is incredibly insecure about herself and it is really grating on me.  Lately I have been incredibly stressed out about how I talk and act around her in order for her not to completely break down and while I don't want the relationship to end I feel like I will lose my sanity if I don't do something.      She has a lot of emotional issues and in the time we have been together she has taken real strides to get better; progress is evident.  However, she seems convinced that I will leave her because she doesn't think that she is good looking enough for me, and I worry about talking to other girls that I know as she seem to constantly think that I want to leave her for them or something similar to that notion.      I have a sarcastic sense of humor and a quick wit that most around me love; however, a lot of times she takes things the wrong way and I am seeing myself being hesitant around others as well which I don't like as well.      I also would like to express myself to her without fear of her thinking wanting to break-up immediately or just completely melting down as that is not what I want.  I see the person she is inside and it comes through more often than not.        I know she has been treated shitty pretty much her whole life by her family, friends and boyfriends so I know change can't be instantaneous but I don't know how long I can hold out for that change before I lose who I have become, which I feel is a pretty kick-*** man.      Please offer any constructive advice as I desperately need it.

They have two kids together and eventually, the relationship ended. Pat worked at a convenience store and obviously couldn't pay any bills, she got her vehicle repossessed and left the house before the landlord could kick her out. Patricia's mother who was living with them moved with a friend in Colorado Springs and took all of their belongings. Patricia took her kids and ran to a salvation house that helps addicts and woman who cant make it on their own. Chris went and saw his kids weekly. He lived two hours away from them now. One weekend he goes there and the place tells him that she left. He called her mother and they both left for California. She had three plus sexual partners since and Chris has had one. Chris' has been a relationship for more than a year. Patricia is randomly sleeping with men. Now, she found out about Chris' girlfriend and doesn't want Chris to see the kids at all. She really doesn't want any other woman involved. What rights will she have to keep the kids full custody? She is also trying to say she hasn't gotten any money for the boys because shes always gotten cash. At one point her and her kids were without hot water or electricity for almost a month because she couldn't pay the bill...
20090304135823AAmW6MH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can you change a gay guy?	I have been friends with this guy for a year and I really started having feelings for him.  He told me he was straight and had a girlfriend so I never told him I liked him.  He always sat with me in class and flirted with me.  Even my best friend thought he liked me.  The other night he text me at 3 in the morning and said I love you, but I'm gay.  I was so shocked and heart broken.  He said his boyfriend was like a girlfriend only better.  Now I am confused and wonder if he could be bisexual because I don't understand how someone could lie to me so long.   I wish he was bi because I still have feelings for him.   My question is can you change a gay guy?  Maybe I am being stubborn but I wish I could make him bi at least.

20090304145007AAZUtLH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My crush ignored me, why did he do that?	Okay, I'll try and keep it simple! If you are REALLY wanting to help me and want background info, check my other questions about him. So, I am very certain that my shy crush likes me, I still have never talked with him and it's been like 5 months since I gave him a note.(I'm shy too). Yesterday I finally asked if I could talk with him after school and he said yes. So I waited for him and then finally saw him. We both made eye contact, I smiled at him and I noticed that he smiled right before he took a drink from the water fountain. But then rather than come over to me, he hurriedly walked off away from me. I am confused. I could be overthinking but if he did not want to deal with me at all, he could've exited the school a different way. Why did he avoid talking with me? Today I had zero courage to talk to him. What would be the next step for me??? Your help is greatly appreciated!!

20090304155837AAUclSs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Confused by actions of a male friend?	He has been a jerk (non-communicative) to me for the past six months, basically.  All of a sudden, yesterday on my birthday I get this three-minute YouTube happy birthday greeting from him. At the end of the greeting, it says, "Happy birthday to a very special friend. I love you." Do you think he is having a guilt complex or something? It's not like him to send something mushy like this.  (I am female).        I am thinking 1 of 3 things:  1) he is feeling guilty about acting like a jerk;  2) he is afraid of losing me as a friend;  or 3) he's being manipulative, i.e., playing me like a violin.

An example would be;   The mother is a succesful actor and wants her child to become the same, but the child does not want this. The childs life is laid out without their own thoughts and ideas being considered.   Other things could be something like, the mother finds out their child is bi- sexual and then disowns them. Just why man, this day and age...? Every human being should have the choice about what they want to do and not their parents, who they didnt even choose to be with in the first place.

Still waiting. Unless I missed it. She will always be in my heart.

20090304154431AA1vga2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	This guy I met and me were talking and we were like flirting/arguing then he punched me. Does he like me? I know guys do things like punching and hitting when they like you.   Then today he said I was a stupid ***** in a very nice way. So does this pretty much mean he likes me?

I turn around and i see the back of his head and it looked like HIM!!! the car also looked like his.. im getting freakd out.. i see him everywhere.. i also saw his car pull up on my driveway just sitting there...       I hate to jump to conclusiosn but i recognize his car and i dont know what to do..       im 18 and this had been going on since we were 11...

And we always glance at each other, and when he does his part or   I do mine, we kind of start to giggle and such.(Not because anybody's ugly or anything like that, or because we can't do our parts.)   & we don't even talk, we just always share laughs and glances.             What does it mean? X:            No mean, sarcastic comments or answers please (:

20090304143225AAoS9bL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Which wedding would you attend?	So, I have already made up my mind but I want to get your opinions.      I have been invited to two weddings on April 18th.      One is Suzanne, a long time friend/church small group leader.  Me and 3 of my best friends have been meeting up with her to have a nice small group to talk about various things with and it's a really good support group.  Well now, Suzanne is getting married to a man that one of the girls in the small group introduced her to. I also knew him long before Suzanne and him met. They had only been dating a few months before they got engaged and will get married less than a year before they met. Well, Suzanne originally told us that we were not invited because it was going to be a very small wedding, with close friends and family.  We were all upset about this because we are the reason why she is marrying this man and have known her for almost 8 years now.  Well, she has now changed her mind and we are invited.      The other wedding is my boyfriend of 2 year's brother's wedding.  It's his last sibling to get married as his other 2 brothers are already married. I have never been to one of his family's weddings and feel it's important to attend that as well.  This wedding date was set before Suzanne was even engaged.      But, I have 3 best friends going to Suzanne's wedding and we are all very close...      Who's would you go to and why?

20090304154419AAsZwxd	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do if someone harassed you like this?	There is this girl at my school named Kristin, she moved to our school about 3 months ago. The first day she got there, she was really annoying, I thought she just wanted new friends. But she never stopped. Then one day, she called me "Prep wearing skinny jeans." She wears these aeropastle shirts all the time, and these gay pin striped skinny jeans. She wears them ALL the time. That was in 3rd hour. Then, in 6th hour, she said,"are you my friend?" I said,"No."   She was all like, whatever hoe.   Wow. Then, everytime I walk by her I say, Prep wearing skinny jeans. She gets surprised. "ME?" she says. Wow. Then we had a sub in 6th hour. She was all back talking the teacher. She wasn't sitting in her right seat. The teacher tried to make her move, then Kristen says,"I've asked the teacher to move me." I screamed, SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MOVE THEN. We all got up in eachothers faces, and now she is calling me names. I said, its not my fault that I am so popular that you have to constantly talk to me. (I dont think that i rude, she seriously kept harassing me!) Just shut up! Wow, this girl is a freak. What do you think I should do? I have already tried to ignore her...   That don't work.      HELP ME!!         But here's the thing, I have made straight A's all my life, and have never gotten in trouble. I have ignored her, except for the one remark I made.

20090304143241AACdcHk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it wrong for a married woman to masturbate?	I got married about a year back. My husband and I share a very healthy, happy & satisfying married and sexual relationship.    I used to masturbate regularly before marriage. After marriage, I had stopped masturbating, and relied only on our sex as a means of my sexual satisfaction.       But of late, I have resumed masturbating (few times in a month). It is NOT because I am sexually dissatisfied or anything of that sort. It is just an old habit that has recurred.      I feel very guilty when i do it (almost as though i am cheating on my husband). He doesn't know that I masturbate. I thought it might probably hurt him, and I love him very much.      If a married woman masturbates, does it amount to cheating the husband? Is it wrong?
20090304143237AA2Q8X2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need an unbiased opinion from someone out of the situation?	My best friend had a fling with my husband a number of years ago. We stopped talking (for obvious reasons) and I was very hurt/angry, etc. for many years. However, I always missed her because she and I were so close and more like sisters than friends.      Recently, we have resurrected our friendship. Do you think that two grown women who really want to, can get past a betrayal like that? years have past and our lives have changed dramatically.

20090304144046AAvL1mg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think i love you...?	I'm in a 3 month relationship with my bf and we click on a lot of things. We can have great conversations and always be intimate with each other, and even though we're both teenagers and blah blah blah well yes I do love him and he loves me; its pretty good right now.   The problem though(here i go contradicting myself) is that for the past few days i've felt an uneasiness around him-not that i'm uncomfortable around him-but i'm noticing when I make a corny joke that he doesn't get or that he's dressing up like Rorschach from Watchmen and the mask freaks me out. now i'm not questioning if I still love him or not but i'm worried I'm getting bored or stressed about the relationship, especially since we may go to different colleges. Sometimes I feel really clingy (been there? ;-p ) and other times I look at him and wonder if we're really as compatible as I thought. maybe it's just my naivety of having a perfect relationship so far, since those don't exist? Idk, i don't understand what i feel like, any ideas? Thanks.

Im not sure if she likes me as much as i like her but she does like me.       What way could i ask her out that would i dont know maybe give that little extra push she might need to see how much i really do like and care for her?      I want it to be perfect, sweep her off her feet. But remember her friend will most likely somehow be in the picture but im sure i could get a 1 on 1 talk or something.

20090304155135AAMKjBJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend has been really depressed lately.  Do you know what I could do to help?	He's depressed because he's never been in a relationship and can't see it happening.  As far as I know, this is his main problem.  Last week, he was really down and didn't smile all week.  This week, it's been all good until he started getting bullied.  I think I might have to beat the crap out of the guy (or guys [I don't really know who's doing it]).  A kid was apparently going to punch him in the face so he ran.  I heard somebody spreading the rumor and laughing about it, so I went and told him because it always helps me to know what people are saying behind my back.  When I told him, he just said, "Yeah, I didn't really feel like getting punched in the face."  Anyways, I walked by him later and he said he feels like dying.  Should I see who he has a problem with and just beat the crap out of them, tell him he should see a therapist, or what?  I don't think I could ever convince him to get help and he may end up just getting pissed off.  What should I do, or do you think I should even intervene?

20090304155609AA8oZ0e	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend got raped and...?	My friend got raped by her moms bf/stepdad when she was little. She told her mom and her mom said well I guess your little brother and sister can't have a dad now. And when it comes to her little siblings she always says yes to them no matter what. She wanted to call the cops but her mom didn't. The thing is I barely found out and we've been best friends since kindergarden and were freshman in highschool now. I don't even want her mom near her or her stepdad. Just knowing that her mom chose the guy before her OWN daughter!! That makes me mad. What should I do?
20090304155756AAI4Sur	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why cant they understand and why is she not fighting for me?	Pretty much here's what happened. The past two weeks of my relationship with my fiance has been kinda rocky. Well it started getting pretty bad i had some issues of my own dealing with trust because well XD i just have trust issues. It started pushing her away and making her unhappy with the relationship. OK now here's where all the crap starts.      I couldn't think of a way to make her happy at this point. So i made a sacrifice, i ended up breaking off the relationship even explaining that I wanted her happy no matter what, with me or without, and that she might be hurt right now (i was crying myself ive got no problem admitting it) but in the end you might just be better off.  Well later on that day i thought to myself, that i had made a mistake and that what i needed to do was just stop being so stubborn and change myself a little.  Well she came over and everything and we got back together something she wanted to do.  Well when the separation happened her mother called and asked me what i did to make her so upset and i even explained the EXACT SAME THING to her a 42 year old woman.      Now that we are back together she says shes (my fiance) the happiest shes ever been because i stopped what i was doing ya know?  Her mother on the other hand and most of her family are pissed at me.  Her mother especially. I mean its pathetic.  I'll be on the phone and hear nothing but her trash talking me and putting me down. Every comment that comes out of her mouth is about me.  I normally dont care about what parents really think i guess you could say (im 20).  But this time its really getting me down and the confusing part is that my better half isnt really doing anything to stop it. I mean not even the word stop. If she was still upset with me i'd understand but the thing is she has told me time and time again that she is totally fine and everything else.      Exactly what in the world do i need to do about this because i really cant take anymore of this mental abuse for real.

20090503123757AAFufJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he so confusing?	Okay were both in high school i am a Junior and he's a Sophomore. He talks to me a lot and teases me (playfully) and if I give him a sad face ( playfully) he always apologizes immediately with a smile on his face. He is usually the one to initiate conversation with me, and if I walk away because he's talking to someone else he will follow me. We text sometimes and one time when I had another guy who liked me he was like yeah i could see why he likes you.. and then he said in a good way with a smile on his face. I always hint that i like a guy, and he asked if it was this other guy we talk to and i said no. Then this girl right in from of him asked me if i liked him and we both just stood there silent and i changed the subject. So what do you guys think I am so confused? because if he liked me why wouldn't he have asked me out already?

20090304103817AA2l29m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do, when two guys like eachother, but your not sure whether or not to date?	I've been talking to this guy for awhile, and just this past weekend we went on our first date. He wants to wait about two months before we go on a date again, because he ended a serious relationship about 5 months ago. He feels that if we start dateing, we will like each other a lot. We have so much chemistry. There was a real special connection we both felt this weekend. But I'm wondering if I should wait the two months? He tells me that i'm free to date other guys, but I really don't want to. I want to date him. I don't know what to do.
20090304103838AA0fg1c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for boys. Please answer!!!!?	What if you saw a beautiful girl in a terminal one day and it so happened that you boarded on the same car. You felt like you would miss half of your life if you didn't talk to her so when you got the chance, you  did and you asked for her number. She did not want to give it to you at first but she finally did when you persisted. You started texting her and calling her and a week later you met up and you both had a great time talking with each other for the whole time you were together. Since then you call her every night and you talk about a lot of things especially your feelings for her. She is simply very special in your life and she becomes your inspiration. She is the good-girl type, conservative, and you do believe she is a real person (not somebody who fools around). You really like her and you feel like you are already falling for her.      What if, only after two weeks of knowing each other and having this special relationship (sort of like a mutual understanding / "M.U."), she tells you that she is dating this other guy for more than a year now. They are not in a serious relationship (also more like M.U.) and she doesn't love the guy yet which is why they are not yet officially together. She tells you that she likes you and is happy when she talks to you and when she is with you.      What would you think about this girl? What would you feel? Are you still gonna keep on courting her or are you going to keep yourself away from her?      Please, guys, tell me what you think about this situation.   Thank you very much!

My bf broke up with me today.He said that he really loves me and he will love me forever,and that he is scared he wont find someone like me anymore, but he can't be with me because he has a felling that when hes with me that he is walking on the sidelines, and when we are with friends he is felling crappy.And that he always feels like he is not good enough for me.Enough interesting,enough funny and all.But he is,he is great and i really love him,and i told him that but still, he says that he just dont feel good with me, but he loves me.What can i do to make him stay???
20090304143022AAThdlQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does this story add up to you?	My abusive soon to be ex-husband told me an odd story...well to me anyway.      He said that he had a crazy ex girlfriend that accused him of rape. The police went to his mother's home and arrested him. The police let him know what the charges were. It just so happened that he recorded the sex act because he knew that she was unstable so he set up a camera as a precautionary measure. He called his mother from the police station and asked her to bring the tape. So, his mother brings the tape and him, his mother, and the police watch this tape. They let him go because it act appeared to be consentual. Apparently she got in trouble for filing false charges...      Does this sound like a shady story or the truth?

20090227075857AAskWzY	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP ME I LOST 2 FRIENDS?	I have two stories.   **PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL NAMES ARE CHANGED**   Here is one:   Ok, so I have this friend, Nicoletta. Well, I HAD her friendship. I guess I lost it. One day in the locker room I told Nicoletta I had created an account for an online game we both enjoyed. When I asked her if she wanted my username so we could connect on the site, she said "Not really..." So at first I thought, 'Why so rude'? Later that day I emailed Nicoletta to findout why she was so mad and rude to me. She didn't respond. The next day my real friends pulled me over in the hall and told me about all the gossip she started about me. I was soooooooo freaking mad at her. I tried to ignore her, but it got worse. I knew I had my real friends to back me up, but me and Nicoletta were such good friends before. She didn't make any new friends, (ex: the 'cool crowd' didnt suck her in) so what had I done? A couple days later my friend Lulu told me at the cubbys that she had asked Nicoletta if I was still her friend. Lulu explianed that Nicoletta had practically screamed "NO".   Help me....?      Story #2:   How do you think it feels to be talked to every day about how scared someone is because some bully who 'beat her up' is in the crowd that we are walking in? Well, its pretty annoying!!! Every day going to Spanish/PE my friend Kira would say "Oh my God there is that boy who beat me up". And I'm like, [in my head] what the heck there are teachers around and he didn't even look at you what is your problam?? So, today I said that I could tell she was being sarcastic. She whispered 'What the h*ll'?? I told her to not worry about it and since she never told me about her bullying I knew she was lying. So then she had this extremely mad look on her face and whsipered 'f*** it'. {PLEASE NOTE that I actually don't know what she said. But it sounded like 'f*ck it'. I'm like, WHAT?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

20090304132713AADtZJl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you ever get over someone you truly loved? Adults Only Please?	My ex-boyfriend and I broke up in early January of this year after being together for almost 5 years. We lived together for 2 of these years and were like family, spending just about everyday, including holidays together. We had a strong relationship where we were best friends and and very passionately in love with each other. It wasn't perfect and we did have our fights, but we always worked things out. For the last 3 months or so of our relationship, I could tell things were falling apart. He was acting different and wanted to be with his friends all the time. He told me he wanted to break up and has pretty much thrown me away like trash ever since.      We have talked a couple times and he says he feels "free" and happier without our relationship, though he "will always love me." He's said things like "maybe in the future" we can try again. This is someone I deeply loved and respected and now he is gone. My head knows that I am better off without someone who would just leave me like this but my heart continues to long for him.      I'm just wondering how long it takes to forget someone you really loved like this? I've removed him from my life: I've changed my cell phone number, I've deleted him on myspace/facebook, I have nothing to do with him anymore. I'm graduating college and moving back to my hometown, so I'll be 6 hours away from where he lives. I'm just wondering when the pain will stop?

20090304110143AASmnr1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How am I supposed to talk to him about how I feel (sort of long)?	My husband can't stand my old friends from back home. This is because they are potheads. I lied to him a while back about doing drugs and he found out. He was extremely hurt but I cleaned up my act. He used to log onto my myspace and delete and block those people he doesn't like, whatever.       He has friends from back home that are female and they send him messages like "I haven't seen you in forever, I want to see you", stuff like that. He goes on their profile often and looks at their pictures a lot. When I ask him about it he gets REALLY defensive. He can't seem to understand why it bothers me. Like no amount of explaining will make him think anything other than "She is nuts". I've had a problem with him where one of his co-workers was talking to him and trying to get him to help with her baby while we were dating a while back. Also complimenting him and stuff (flirting, duh) It broke my heart because he even said he'd think about it. A little bit after that he told me he was just joking about the whole thing when she decided to get with one of his friends instead.      I got mad at him the other day because he gets pissy about me talking to my friends he feels uncomfortable with but then he goes and does the same thing! He turned it around on me and said I'm crazy and insecure. He even wrote me a really defensive letter. It hurt me so badly. It's like he's defending his friends and insulting me. i deleted my myspace becuase I was tired of the drama. If he's going to talk to females then I don't even want to know.      I just got put on an antidepressant after a few years of not taking any. I think about killing myself to end the pain. I do not want to live without him and I love him so much. He is the only person that has the ability to hurt me this bad.      What kills me more is that he's acting like everything is cool. he even told me today that he's just letting me be mad at him until I get over it. This is too much. He always makes me out to be the bad guy.      Be brutally honest with me please, I'm going insane. What do you think? What am I supposed to do?

20090304125418AAcGuvo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE answer?!?!? It's not like we have sex while she's there...?!?!?	Well, my fiance, Patrick, and I live in a different state than my family,and my 15 year old sister, Nicole, is coming to stay with us next week. I'm really excited to spend some time with her, because we don't see each other very much now. However, last time she stayed here, I kind of sensed this... awkward feeling between her and Patrick and I... Like, when he would go to work, he'd kiss me goodbye (Just a peck), and I'd sense this awkwardness with Nicole and I after that for a bit... I know she likes Patrick, so it's not that, but it's just... weird... Why do you think this happens? Everytime he'll kiss me or touch me or something (Obviously not sexually, or anything... just like, hugging me, a peck on the lips, holding my hand, etc...) And she stays in our guest room, but if she needs something in the evening and we're in our room just watching TV, she won't go in, or she'll just kind of awkwardly, quietly ask for what she needs... It's weird... It's not like we have sex when she's there or anything... What should I do to make her feel more comfortable? Also, any clue as to what's going on here??
20090304122728AAH1gBl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a short guy ever find someone?	I am 18 and only 5'4". I know you're going to say just date short girls, but it is not that simple.      I asked a girl out recently and she told me that I wasn't tall enough for her. This girl was very short herself. Probably around 5'0" since she came up to about my eye brows.
20090227075947AAvK1g8	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think I should do in this situation?	I’m 22 years old and I think it’s been long enough that I should have to continue to deal with this. And please, let me know if this makes any sense at all to you. My parents are divorced for a number of reasons. My parents were only 22 when they had me.       - My dad cheated on my mom in the back seat of my mom’s car and got the women pregnant. 9 months later she had my sister.       - He left my mom when I was 3 years old and decided not to pay child support. He went to jail several times.       - My aunt (mother’s sister) got him a nice manager job at a store, which he stole money from and got fired.       I hate him for a slew of reasons.       - He denied me as his child, but showers my two other sisters with anything they want. He was with three women, btw.. So, three kids from three different women.       - Ever since a few months ago, he has been writing me harassing e-mails, saying that he wants a relationship, but that I need to work for his love and that I am just like my mother.      - He is a brick wall. Nothing I say gets through. He doesn’t actually care about me.      - He has the whole family on his side. They agree that I am wrong and he is right, even though he hurts me on a daily basis and he says those nasty things about me and my mom.       - My grandparents think I am the “gap” in the family and that I was born out of wedlock, so that makes me not apart of the family.      Look, I love my family and I have tried to keep a relationship with them, but all that happens is I get hurt one way or another. And they don’t seem to care. They practically blame me for everything. My father never did anything for me, except give a little bit of money here and there. He’s missed b-days, Christmas, special events. He treats my sisters better then his first born: ME! He is wrong, I know it, and his family agrees with him! My mother has moved on from his crap! She tells me to cut all ties, forget them, move on. All they know how to do is guilt the crap out of me and make me feel like less of a person for being born like I did. Like it’s my fault, right? I think my mom is right. What do you think? Do you think I should just drop my whole family? Forget about them? Would you be able to do it?

20090304135351AAHQ73i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I have seen?	Women confuse me.    I'm a non traditional student.  In other words I'm a bit older than most college students.  I've been in a class with this attractive young lady.    She sat next to me in lab the first lab day.  A few days later she moved up next to me in lecture.  We started having breakfast together after class 2 days a week.  We spend about 1.5 hours together.  Fast forward a couple of weeks and she asked me to study with her.  I am an A student in all my classes.  We met up twice and studied for several hours.  At one point in lab I would have bet my life she was interested, she was practically standing on top of me.  In other words she gave me no personal space.     So, I asked her out this past Monday morning.  She gave me an ambiguous answer and I walked away not sure if we would or would not go out.  So, I let it sit for 2 days and I talked to her about it today.  She gave me the canned reply of "I just wanna be friends".     What should I have been watching for to see that she was not interested?  This can not be your typical beauty and the geek.  I may be smart but I'm more of the bad boy type than I am geek.  Although, as I am older these days I do tone it down a lot.

As in, you're dating a girl and after a week she tells you she usually has sex with a guy after a month.      And she brings it up.

20090304120723AAiO5ng	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what would you do? ugh so embarrassing!?	So, there is this guy I like...like reaaaaallly like!..and he is a really good friend.  Me and my sister went to visit him for his birthday for the weekend so we stayed at his apartment.(he lives about 3 hours away now) So, He had this party with a bunch of his friends at his place and everyone got pretty drunk.. I know I got wasted..and I have never gotten this drunk before in my life..so my sister got sick and puked..and he took her to go sleep in his bed..so that night was is pretty fuzzy to me before I know it I'm getting really sick and I guess I puked too.. I had way to many shots.. of different kinds of liquor..never again lol. but anyway I remember him helping me and taking me to the bathroom and being really sweet just helping me get cleaned up and and barely remember this but I was holding onto him like hugging after that.. but that's all I can remember..and I know I must have done something stupid or said something stupid but I can't remember..becuase last night I talked to him on IM and and he said that he thinks I should be promoted..and of course I didn't know what he was talking about..so I asked him promoted to what? or promoted from what?? lol.. and he said loser..(we like to tease eachother and call eachother names) so he always playfully calls me loser lol. and I always call him a geek. but anyway he came up with this super sweet nickname for me a certain type of flower.. and I made a joke  and said .."hm I was thinking like..um.. pukey???....not"  just playing around   and he said "lol,well...that could be our little secret.....haha"      so now I am like OMG I can't remember half that night...I know I like him so much..I probably did or said something really stupid..      because earlier in the night his friends were telling me I should kiss him because it was his birthday and i was like nooooo.. and they took me over to him and told him I wanted to kiss him.. ahh I denied it..but I don't remember much too long after that point.. but I remember him taking me and putting me in bed after being in the bathroom.. So I have a feeling I might have tried to kiss him or I said I wanted to kiss him I have no Idea......         *sigh* he is such a sweet guy... this is embarrassing I don't know if I should ask if I did or said anything that night.. because I simple can't remember.. what would you do??                  BTW I have learned my lesson with alcohol lol.

20090304131751AA5pmXv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My boss e-mails me regularly...."just to talk"?	Well, my former boss. He was head of the region, I met him once when I was an intern. Immediately, he gave me his contact info and offered to help me find a job. Time passed, we spoke on the phone, e-mailed, but I decided to take a position elsewhere.      About a month ago, he e-mailed to see how the job was and  wanted to keep in touch for "networking" purposes. But now e-mails very regularly, just talking about everyday things, joking around, sharing interests, etc. He's very friendly and outgoing but I'm not sure how to take this..      I have no idea if he's married, how old he is, etc. He has to know I'm much younger, since I was an intern when we met...and we only met ONCE. What do you think his intentions are? Just friendly...or?
20090304120608AAmxqLx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should i marry this my fiance?	Well, something happened between me and my fiance yesterday night while we were talking. We decided to tell each other all our lies and secrets before getting married. I ended up telling her that i slept with her best friend before we started to date. She actually already knew that, but i lied to her it only happened once. The truth was that it happened several times, but i never felt anything for her. I only used her to waste time. Anyway, after hearing that she also confessed she had lied to me as well. She had also slept with a friend while we were dating. Actually she had been having sex with this guy for while, before she even met me. The guy wanted her to move in with him, but she never wanted nothing more from him and used him for company when she was alone. Anyway i understand if he slept with the guy before she met me. The thing that has me angry is that she slept with him while we first started going out. We werent really boyfriend and girlfriend, but im used pissed off about that. She says she slept with him because me and her werent really serious then and just started to go out. Im also pissed she lied about this when i asked her way back. SHe said she never slept wth him and never went beyond kisses. I know i lied to her as well. But my actions were before i ever met her.       Anyway, i love her with all my heart. Im just scared that she will break my heart in the future. Not just because of this. But she told me how she was single she used to date a lot of guys, and sometimes even at the same time. She even had two abortions from two guys. I accepted all of that since it happened before she met me. She even changed her number for me and let me rip all her photos wth her past boyfriends and phonenumbers. She hasnt cheated on me since we got serious and has done everything that i asked. She has an 8 year old daughter that i have grown atatched to.  She has promised me she will never ever cheat on me, but she also said if i ever cheated on her she would do the same.        So, i need opinions. Should i follow my heart. Or do you guys think she will cheat on me?

20090304122609AAdaWid	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me? Please help me!?	Ok, so I like this guy named Myles. Myles knows that I like him. So do two of my friends. I've been wondering if he likes me for a while. He's one year younger than me, and two grades below.   We've talked on facebook a bit. The first time, he actually initiated the conversation by saying hello. I said hey, he got off a little later, and came back on about an hour later. I asked him why he said hello and he said 'idk, maybe i felt like it at the time. should i not say hello to you anymore' and I said no, and I was just wondering why.   When I told my best guy friend about this conversation (he didn't know it was Myles at that point but he found out later that day), he said that when Myles said hello, he was putting himself out there.   The other day, on facebook, I said hey, he said 'you like germany' (he must have been looking at my profile). Then we were talking about Germany for a bit. He tried to ask if I can speak German in German. I answered in German, and said how it could be corrected. He said, 'wow, im impressed' Later, I had a notification that he had tagged me in a note (25 Random Things). Then he signed off.   We have one class together, band. The other day, Myles saw a bit of another side of me... Normally I'm insanely quiet and stuff. I was talking to my best friend across the music room. Throughout our conversation, Myles was there and I think he was listening a bit, and he seemed to have a bit of a smile/smirk on his face. That's like the first time that I've been like that near him.   The other day, I was walking in the halls, and there weren't many people in the halls, I was heading one way, and as I was passing Myles, he looked up, I smiled, and he returned the smile.   Yesterday, a few minutes before the bell rang for the end of the day, Myles and I made eye contact for maybe two seconds...   Last night we were talking on facebook, and he said 'you looked nice today, if you dont mind me saying' then I said 'oh, thanks' and then he said 'haha, not to be random or anything'. (I told two of my friends this, one guy, one girl. The girl said 'awwwwwwwwwwww that just like made my day' and the guy said 'good for you' and 'wonderful'. They both know I like him... more the guy than the girl.)   Do you think he likes me? And if he does, why do you think he hasn't made a move or anything yet?   THANK YOU SO MUCH
20090227074649AAjM0xO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is your opinion?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her why I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and i want to hook up with her but she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? I can't focus on work because I always think of her,

20090304143300AAP9muv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	BLAST FROM THE PAST! HELP?	I have a boyfriend. We have been together for almost two months and spent time getting to know each other before that. We have a dog together and see each other everyday. Lately, I have been concerned because we seem to argue alot for a couple who just got together a couple months ago. I think seeing him everyday makes things harder. He gets mad when I want to go out with my friends and can't seem to let me have any time on my own. I know I have done this to myself basically because I saw him everyday since we started dating. I take that blame myself. But I feel like sometimes I just need to get away. I really do care about him.      Then the other day, a blast from my past came up. He had went away to the army and we had not spoken since. He texted me to make sure I had been doing good. We had never dated but really cared about each other and grew up together. He told me he had feelings for me and that when he comes home he wants to see me. I really don't know what to do. I feel so lost right now. Any advice?      And nobody saying mean things. I honestly need advice.

20090227075500AAr5Hvr	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do we get any say in the shower?	My aunt volunteered to throw the shower for my family. However, I'm getting really uncomfortable with what's happening. She's asking us to invite people - she tried to get the whole guest list to pick people to invite from, now she's just trying to get us to list friends, and to get my fiance's family contact info.       I know that it's her party, not ours, but I'm really worried that she's going to offend my fiance's aunt who is throwing the shower for that side of the party. I'm also uncomfortable with the fact that she wants people to attend two showers.       I told her that my fiance's family is doing their own shower. Her only response to this was "oh, I hadn't known that": no complaint that she wanted to throw a double shower, or request to work with my fiance's aunt to do a double shower instead. She then went to get the contact info a different way. Realistically (i.e. remembering that we're adults, none of this "it's your day" nonsense), how much say do we get in this? Do I just have to sit by and let her harass people to give us yet more gifts?      And yes, my fiance is uncomfortable with this too, so it's not just *me* being selfish here, it's us.
20090304112613AAAEg5q	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it tacky to have a reception a year after the marriage?	My boyfriend and I were talking about getting married when we found out we were expecting. Now we're thinking about going down to the courthouse, but I still want to have the BIG wedding I've been planning since I was a wee little girl. My sister suggested having a reception a year from now, after the baby is born. I'm worried this is "tacky" though. I want to celebrate with our families, but I'm afraid people will think I'm being greedy. Its customary in my family to be given envelopes of cash or wedding gifts as in any other family. What are your personal thoughts on this? Thanks!

20090304134104AA2GCf2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wow. 10 points!! and over 21 please!!What do u think i should do in this situation knowing how he still feels?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.

My Ex Boyfriend and his family are always moaning about the way the relationship ended but should i have to put up with it now that i have another man?       My ex Harry is a sweet boy and i really did like him and i thought he was cute, but Steve (my current) can take much better care of me. He is a big strong football player with muscles far bigger than harry's.       Steve had liked me for quite a while before we got together and he arranged to meet up with Harry to have a fight and winner got to be with me :). Harry objected strongly and kept saying and wrong it was or that is was uncomfortable for him. So i threatened to leave him if he didn't step up for the fight. (because i want a man, not a coward) So harry showed up and tried to reason with Steve but Steve beat the holy crap outta him and that is why I am with Steve today because he is strong and tough and every girl's dream.      Should i feel guilty about Harry though? He is threatening to take me to court but he is in the wrong because he keeps using emotional blackmail

20090304114303AA9nj9N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Upset over bf's sexual past?	I know I shouldn't be. I am not judging him, I don't want people to bash me, because I don't care what you do in your private life. I am only talking about him and me. It just hurts me that he had sex before me. I have never had sex and am waiting till marriage (I'm 23). It was just the way I was raised. He wants us to wait till we marry.       He had 3 sexual partners before he met me. I know the spiel about him being with me now, he's not with them for a reason ... but seriously how can I get over this. I am just worried he's comparing me to them. Not the fact that he had sex, but the fact that I am not good enough. I know guys talk about these things and I just want to be perfect ... all the other guys I had dated were virgins (I know they were) so dating him is new ... but not bad. Sometimes I think to much about it and I just want to be the best he ever had. I think it makes me self-conscience when we're intimate.       I don't want dumb answers. I am not judging and I love him so much and he loves me. I just want to know how I can get over this and stop being jealous of him being with other women before me.

Anyhoo, I ended up sleeping over at the host's house and so did Mike, and one of my friends told me he likes me. Which made me happy. Yaaay! So then we sort of flirted and he gave me a hug. He told me that I give good hugs and I returned the complimant. Which was cute. We hung out with some other couple during the day but he didn't really talk to me as we walked to Heng Weng. When he left he hugged me good bye but didn't give me his number or ask for mine....   I did hear from my friend he does kind of like me, but he doesn't know me so he wants to get to know me more....   So? What do you lovely yahoo answers people think? Do I have a chance with this guy?
20090304113506AA5nEBo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WIVES, what is going on?!?	In the last hour I've come across so many questions saying, "should i confront my husband"?because they've found out that their husbands are talking to a girl, or getting pics from girls, etc and they are whether afraid or doubtful to confront their husbands.I believe in a marriage there should not be secrets and anything should be kept from each other. My husband and I know each others passwords for everything and for A LOT of people that would be considered to be too NOSY. The thing is if you don't check on your husband/wife at least every once in a while don't you think some of us would end up like these people who are being cheated on?

20090227074756AAWpCB6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this guy, not sure what to do!?	Okay, so theres this guy at college that ive liked since Christmas. I used to just think he was good looking, but all my older friends (who know him a bit) say he's really nice. Ever since then, i just can't stop thinking about him. I don't know what to do, one of my guy friends, who knows him, told him that me and my friend Rosie, liked him, so he knows i like him, i think, as he didnt get a proper look at my face that day.       Ive never seen him speak to any of my other friends, but the other week he came up to my friends twice in one day and started talking to them when i was around...at first i thought this might mean something...but now im not sure. Ive never spoken to him before and im not really sure how to speak to him, cos i can't just say hi to him, cos that would be weird. I was thinking about adding him on facebook, but im worried he might reject me.      Any suggestions on what i should do?      Thanks :)   X

I think he likes me because about weeks ago he asked me why I don’t talk to him anymore. I told him it’s because I promised his sister I wouldn’t date him. But I really like him. And she knows that, plus she said that I’m not good enough for her brother. Now I have to sit around and watch him with his new girlfriend. We talked yesterday and he wants to be with me, but I can’t because I don’t want to sacrifice my friendship. I’m torn. It hurts me to see him wit someone else. And it hurts me to be with someone else, and the whole time I’m thinking of him. What should I do? Tell my best friend to get over it and respect my decision that makes me happy or sulk around all day and respect her decision? HELP……

20090304142156AAKEA8F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell him...?	So, here's how it is. I'm 14 and gay. There's this guy (same age) and I don't simply, "fancy" him I actually love him. I sense and have a feeling that he isn't 100% straight. He knows how I feel about this but now he is really depressed and he says he hates me. Now I think that this could be because, 1. he is secretly gay and is in denial *or* 2. he secretly likes me but doesn't have the courage to tell me. What do you think? How do I get him to open up to me and help him cheer up AND how do I get him to stop hating me.      Would appreciate any GOOD answers      Love y'all   LG x

I took her out for sushi and then to a bar for drinks. She was extremely distant, moody, cold, mean and insulting the entire night. When we got back to her house she told me she had to work the next morning and that she'd get better sleep if I didn't stay over (the first time this has ever happened in 3 months. i always stay over). I was drunk, but she didn't seem worried about me getting a dui or in an accident. she then called me as i was walking to my car and asked me to come back and hang out a little longer. i was pissed, but i went back thinking she may have realized what she did. after no more than 10 minutes she said she was going to bed and kicked me out again. I've never been so angry with anyone's selfishness, let alone someone who's supposed to care about me. i haven't spoken with her since saturday. she texted me yesterday but i gave her single-word replies until she got the hint and left me alone. should i call and confront/break up with her or should i keep blowing her off until she calls me and try to work it out?

20090304120931AAifInE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	BOYS ONLY!!! Why do boys do stuff like that?	Hey. Ok. I have never actually had sex with a guy and I'm not planning on it until I am married. I am in my second year of high school and I was wondering why guys (I know not all of them) don't respect girls more. I mean, if they have sex with a girl, they are stealing away the precious gift of virginity that they could have someday given to their husband on their wedding night. Guys should respect us more and wait. Ask their girlfriends for help cause I know that you guys have a hard time. But thats that way God made you, strong sex drive and all. So why don't guys respect girls?

I am quite a shy girl when there is a person who i feel inferior to... for example the boy i like or certain girls. I don't know what it is. I clam up and don't know what to say. My body language is very cramped... What type of body language should i have with talking with cool people i dont know? Whats things should i say? I am in the 'cool group' at school but i don't fit in THAT well because i am soo 'in my own world' ... its not realy my scene... I have 3 very close friends... but they get along well because they act completely different when they are with the whole group.      Now the guy! I have made out with him once when clubbing... (problems my bff liked him too and embarrasing akward wow) But i still like him so much. He laughs with other girls... but acts like i dont exist. I am shy and when i walk past him... sometimes i tilt my head away from him. What can i say I AM SHY... but i am... well a very goodlooking girl. What can i do to let him see me in a more attractive light? I have many classes with him and since we are in the same friend grop... we sit on the same table... but us two never talk.

20090304104730AAtjNoG	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I make myself less nervous/awkward... more confident?	I have this friend....and I like him a little more than a friend....but he doesnt know that...       everytime Im talking to him I get nervous and start analyzing everthing i do like "oh crap, did my voice sound weird when I said that?" or "am i talking too fast?" or "am I walking weird?" and basically everything I do makes me think Im making myself look stupid and I can't seem to calm down and I start saying random stuff just for the sake of saying something, and then to make it worse hes one of those guys whos like always relaxed and "smooth" lol      Now that I wrote that and looked back on it this really seems more like a self confidence issue.      does anyone have any advice for me? I really don't want to look like an idiot in front of him XD
20090304142135AApFlsq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What the hell do I do? I DO NOT want to leave him?	am completely bored and lonely lately. I go to work, go to class, and come home and do homework and watch tv. That's it. There really aren't any extracurriculars at school because it's a community college and it's hard to make friends because it's a commuter campus so students just go to class and go home. I'm also really shy. I used to at least dance but it's just gotten to expensive.      On top of that, I feel like I never see my boyfriend anymore. He's wonderful and I love him more than anything, but the past couple weeks he's been totally consumed with his work and some other stressful problems. We usually only spend the weekends together anyway, and call each other a few times a day but now I feel like we talk maybe once a day and he usually has to rush off the phone to get back to work. And last weekend we only spent a few hours together on Friday night.      I finally saw him last night but we basically just went to bed, and when I asked if I would see him this weekend he said he would probably be too busy, and if he got some free time that he might go play poker with his brother to relax.      He said things might be different if we lived closer (he lives in the city, and I live 45 mins away in the suburbs). I tried to hint that I want to see him more but i feel like I'm being a jerk because I know how hard he's working and how stressed he is right now.       I just don't know what to do!!! Help please?!?
20090304113240AAmVRrX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you guys help me with this one? I dont know what to think?	! was dating a woman who absolutely loved me and then turned on me and dumped me 6 months after divorce. I started asking her questions about her affairs on her ex and she told me "I was married 20 years and had an affair for 5 years(turns out 8 years) and that she has no remorse for any of it. I started asking her questions because I became concerned as to whether she had learned from this, and she said I dont think having an affair for that long was that bad...After I asked about it, she started dumping on me. Was I wrong to ask her about this?

20090304125148AArnmfB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I started talking to this guy and..?	To make a long story short...      He's coming out of being engaged and my boyfriend and I were near that step. His fiancee was pregnant and because they broke up she had an abortion which is hurting him greatly. I am upset because the main reason me and my bf broke up was because of lack of communication and him being extremely immature.      I like this new person a lot and we've been getting close over the last few days being we are basically going through the same things (just his is a lot worse).       Is there a time length before I should really start giving the relationship a chance? In a way I feel that God is bringing us together and I know this guy is the type that will stay friends with me even if we don't start dating right now.
20090304134049AAq0gOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why was he unsure about taking my virginity? Did he stop liking me? I'm confused!!?	So he lives in Miami (my hometown), I go to school in New York and I met him over winter break...(he's 25, I'm 18). We made out at a party, really clicked...he asked me out and kept texting me but I ignored it...then he asked my sister about me (they work together) and she said I was embarrassed...Then I saw him that week and I agreed to watch a movie at his house when he asked again....(but I made it clear we wouldn't have sex)...      Well he was ALL OVER ME but I was really nervous and uncomfortable while he was trying to do things and he noticed...we started talking and he found out that I was raped bc I started crying when he asked if I've had sex before...then he kept saying sorry and said I was beautiful and gorgeous and needed someone who wasn't a jerk, etc. Next time I saw him, he wasn't as touchy feely and excessively flirty as before (which bothered me lol)....Then I left for New York and a week before I came down for president's day weekend I texted him and said I was coming....he seemed happy...long story short I said I'd be willing to sleepover this time (since he'd always want me to before, even just to sleep and not do anything). I also hinted that I wanted sex....then he said he couldn't take advantage and didn't want to lead me on since I live in New York and nothing could really happen...So I said I didn't care and asked him if he really liked me and felt attracted to me....he said yes but is unsure about taking my virginity (I'm technically not since I was raped tho) since its serious......then I mentioned how he seemed to really want it that night at his house and asked what changed....and he said "nothing changed. I'm just making sure you're ok." then I finally convinced him it was fine with me and when I asked again he said he wanted it too and it would mean something to him......but I am so confused....wouldn't a guy that said he likes me be really happy if I said I wanted sex?? and not be so unsure and hesitant about it? what's his deal?!? to be honest, I was kind of offended lol any insight would be GREAT! I really like him =)      oh and I haven't had sex with him yet....when I came down to Miami last time, we were both too busy...so it would prob happen during spring break....and as a side note...i asked him if the rape thing freaked him out and he said no....I also kept asking him if he was sure about liking me and wanting to have sex and told him it was hard to believe and that I thought he was lying...and I think he got mad bc he said "Ok well I don't know what else to tell u but this is getting annoying"...then I apologized and he said it was ok...and he wanted me to talk dirty to him...and I did eventually but he didn't seem into it, said he was busy....haven't talked to him since for like 3 days =/

20090304131156AAI1TOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there anything there..? Would it work out?	My brother is 20 yrs old but his best friend is going to be 16 in a few months... Im 13 and I keep getting mixed signals from my brother's best friend. I mean, I've liked him since I was 10, we used to hang out in the summer, alll evening.. Eventually we grew apart as I expected, and he was dating a girl for many months, close to a year. I was really happy for him, he'd been in a bad relationship with someone before and I think he was scared to open up to anyone else for a long time. Anyway, his relationship with the 8-9 month girl ended a few days ago, and he keeps sending me weird signals like flirting and everytime we make eye contact he drags the stare out longer.. I end up looking away because his eyes are so intense.. We mess around together alot now because hes always with my brother. I walked in wal-mart with him for an hour a day ago and alls he did was show off and flirt (a very small liitle..) I keep getting confused.. I surpressed my feelings for him for a long time but now they keep bubbling back up.. Its intimidating.. Can anyone give me advise or maybe an exclamation for his actions? If I ever do go out with him I know it'd have to be awhile because he was just in a break-up.. I don't want either of us to get hurt on this situation so I don't think I want to make the first move or anything. I'd really love some help here. Thanks so so so very much!!

20090304135510AAe5qAv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is My Cousin a Lesbian?	I went on a trip to NJ last weekend with my cousin and one of her girlfriends, I'm only 13, my cousin and her friend are in their 20s already. to save money we stayed in one hotel room with two beds. My cousin said she wanted to sleep in the same bed with her friend, so I could have my own bed.      But at night, I was woken up by a noise, I didn't get up or move. I saw my cousin and her friend were both under the sheets, their entire bodies were covered and I couldn't even see their faces. But it seems like they were directly on top of each other. I could only see their hands hanging out at the top of the bed, they were holding both hands with their fingers crossed, so I knew they were face to face. They stayed that way for a long time, and it seems like they were pushing each other or having some sort of test of strength, I got a lil scared because I thought they were fighting. They stayed like that for at least an hour or so, they didn't let go of each other's hands at all, it was kinda like hand to hand wrestling or domination of some sort.      Is my cousin a lesbian? I can't be sure since I didn't see anything clearly.....or were they just wrestling?

20090227075155AAQA7pT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Trouble with popular people?	What is up with them? They are really starting to get on my nerves. They don't talk to anyone that isn't in their little group of friends. There are a few of them that I particurlarly don't like, for certain reasons.      A few of my friends used to be popular (and one still is, she just hangs out with us sometimes.) And this one girl literally told them that they couldn't sit with them at lunch anymore because they weren't cool enough. (How sad is that?) So now they sit with us, which I am totally glad about because they sat with us sometimes before they were kicked out of their old group, so I know they aren't just using us. They are really nice and I wish all people were like them.      There is one girl that always walks over to our lunch table and only talks to the people that are/used to be popular and pretty much just ignores the rest of us. It is really rude and I wish she would just go away sometimes!      Then there is this one girl that is soooo caught up with herself. I can totally see through her little act. She is so rude to everyone that isn't popular. She only talks to people that are her friends and it's so stupid!      One of my friends is really popular, and I am okay with that, I am not jealous, (I DO NOT want to be popular at all!) And anyways, sometimes when I am talking to her, one of her popular friends will come and basically just go right in front of me and start talking to her and she doesn't even do anything about it! They probably just think they are more important than I am. Does/did anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it?
20090304135655AAnMjiO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	***Getting Sweet Old Revenge***?	I know what I wrote down may sound a little mean,   but you have understand why I'm doing this.   When my sister was in high school, she fell in love with this guy and had a baby before marriage,and my parents didn't really like the guy cuz , well he's a bum!! and he's never there for her or the baby they have been living a hard life. Anywayz, since that happened, my aunts from my fathers side has been so mean, rude and disrespectful to our family especially my mother.(my aunts never liked my mother) They looked down on our whole family and my cousins too. They made a HUGE deal out of it. And saying things like she's ignorant, she doesn't know how to raise her children. My aunt was going around to other people's house and spreading rumors about our family. This was just an excuse to put my mother and sister down. This is so not my mothers fault. you can teach your children good things but we all have our own mind. And the thing is she has daughters too they have done mad  things with boyz but she hides it.   so what i want to know is what can i do to take revenge on her through her daughters??   i know, i know your thinking it's wrong and that's the same thing my mother said to me, she is a very nice women, she believes in karma.   but i just can't wait.   so any advice??

I have yet to even try an make a move or anything so i dont understand.

Means I do all other extra work to give her extra relief but even though she always talking bad about my parents. My parents are in Canada right now but she said why they are not coming here. Everybody knows that she fight with them that's why they left my home and everybody thinks that that's good for her and for my parents. Even though she always fighting with me saying that your parents are self-fish, your sister is self-fish, She force me not call my parents and even force me to talk bad when they call me. Every day she said to me that looks in our friends group all parents helping them but not your parents. We fight lot because of those things. I never initiate discussion about my family but some how she started and end up fighting. Even I help her lot she doesn’t care of my help. Looks like she find the way to tight and after that I have to say sorry and get back to her normal mood. She calls my work during her lunch and force me to talk and list ion her and that's also for long time. If I said I can't talk more then she started like you don't like me. I can't say anything to you etc...Etc...Even if I late by 10 minutes from my work she says why are you late? I said because of traffic...the she said you are also lier like your parents....self-fish like your parents....and then didn't speak to me whole day and I have to say sorry.....   So looks like what ever she said to me, I have to agree with her. She always insult and torcher me and I keep silence. I am still doing this for my kids but how long...I am scared that if I speak up then I can't stop...I can say all her bad things that she did to me and my family and I am not sure that what she can do after that....that's why I am still quiet. She even didn't talk to her parents, brothers and sisters because everybody knows and told her that it's purely her mistake...so looks like I am the only person left for her...and I do care about her...but how long this continues???????   Please help.......give your good opinion.   Thanks.

20090304113907AAQuVzv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need advice about my date?	I am kind of desperate.    Well about 2.5 years ago i met a guy and we got real close. But in the end i decided for someone else. So we stopped being in contact. He was real upset about it, cause he was in love with me.   Anyways in december i saw him again - and i also broke up with the other guy. So we decided to see each other more often. It was real good and we had lots of fun in the past weeks. And i also said i want him back in my life and to date him again, cause i really couldnt forget him when i was with the other guy. He said he was all the time in love with me and is hoping that it works out this time.    My problem is: one day hes super sweet and the next day hes kind of ignoring me.    So i wonder if its cause of the past, as i decided to be with someone else instead with him. We talked about it, but he said its not like that. But also said, i never ignore you. :S   I start to wonder if hes not used to a gf, cause he has been single for several years. But i also feel real bad - cause i feel like hes ignoring me and that he keeps lying to me, about that he loves me. (why else would he be like that?).... any advice?       Btw: hes 30, me 26

20090304114733AA7Y1gc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is HE abusive ????? Or What!!!?	My b-friend has been dating this guy for 2 to 3 weeks now. He is so cute, he has the deepest dimples. Educated, Independent in all areas. BUT she said his strong personality scares her.He's too real.She cant trick him in any conversation.He's straight to the point.In a firm way .He communicates perfectly.He gets a little upset with her if she gets mad at him over something little.He stresses to her in a demanding way that she needs to explain her emotions first,express herself before reacting.He says only kids get mad.Not grown women.She cant interrupt him ever.And if she does he says did I interrupt you?Are we grown? And she has to answer or he will repeat his ques.Every ques he asks her,if she takes to long to answer,he repeats the ques louder but not in a screaming tone.But he's very calm when he' talking to her.My husband and I met him the other day.He seem ok to us.So how do you know your getting ready to start your life off with your abusive mate? Do you think she's just thinking too much into it?

20090304123546AA6Gl68	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Looking at girls boobs?	there this girl in my English class who I used to like. Today me her and this other kid were partnered to write a paper together. While each of us were writing I stared at her boobs which are pretty big. I saw her eying me out of the corner of her eyes. Then she looked up and then I looked up and I said "what" and she said "what". so i stopped for a little until we had to stand in the middle of the room to do an exercise. I looked and her boobs and i think though im not sure, but the zipper to her sweater was lower and I could see  the top of her boobs. I was staring the whole time. Do you think she might have zippered it down. She doesn't seem like the girl who would do that to get someones negative attention. Also do you think she knew I was looking? Why didn't she just say something?

We broke up on monday and were together for 4 months that time. He asked out a girl about a hour after me and him broke up. Last night we were on the phone talking, and he was telling me how he has been lying to himself and trying to convince himself he doesnt love me. He told me that he knows i love him and he loves me so we need to get back together. So he told me he was going to break up with the new girl today.

20090304123648AAG9sXz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women a question about a girl who interests me.?	Okay so I am a 29 y/o male.  I tend to think I have somewhat handsome features.  So this bar that my co workers and I frequent, there is this bartender.  She struck my interests one evening when we had a conversation about writing, and art.  My buddy kept talking about her but never did anything about it.  So I took a chance and wrote her a note on a napkin, asking her if she would like to have dinner.  She accepted, but for some reason I couldn't fit it into my schedule.  Then again I called her but she seemed to lose interest.  We still go there just to hang out but I quit talking to her.  After finding out that she went out with this other guy I know.  After I asked her out.  So I go over there one evening with a friend of the guy she went out with.  His name comes up and the look on her face was kinda funny just knowing that we knew him.  So anyways everytime I go there I hardly speak to her, just the normal hi how are you doing.  So last week my she asked my co worker why I don't talk to her anymore.  So what the hell does this mean, am I looking to much into it.  Opinions please
20090304123948AA5EAw3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating my ex boyfriends best friend?	I dated a guy for 4 years we were so in love but in the end grew apart .it didnt end well and we no longer talk to each other it has been 15 months since the break up and we both seem to have moved on with our lives he is seeing someoneelse and has been for a while, while i have been dating and enjoying the single life for a bit.we share few mutual friends but one of these has hinted that we should talk and get in touch just to be civil and so we can maybe catch up as a group, this hasn't happened yet but i think we are both moved on. One mutual friend we shared kept in touch with me after the brak up some did not. this one was his old friend who he's known since primary school we are now 26 !! we had alsways got on so i thought nothing of it. a few months ago we started to hang out as friends laughing at each others bad dates etc...   a month ago he said he likes me and has done for some time i said i liked him too bit did not wish to persue this as it would be too strange as me & my ex dont talk and they are best friends. he seemed cool with it but we flirted much more and ended up sleeping together. i want him to tell my ex as i think he should know but he doesn't want to yet he wants to see if we get more serious first as he doesn't want to rock the boat with his mate until we get spend more time together and are sure of what we want......im very confused now as i feel sleeping with him & going on dates was a big deal and i dont want to go "sneaking around".   i feel bad enough for seeing an exes friend as it is something i would  never even do so now feel a bit guilty...when i am with him he calms me down assuring me it's fine & i feel ok.... im just a bit worried if this guy is as serious as he says he is about me or if im over analysing and worrying to much...i know that many of our friends wont approve but more worried of meeting my ex for the first time in over yr saying im sleeping with his best mate

20090304130248AApIjOK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really just his "best friend"?	my boyfriend and i have been together for about two years now, and about 6 months before he met me, his met this girl. They have a good relationship together before he met me, she is 25 and my boyfriend is 19. they used to call each other everyday and i fully understand they have become best friends. but after he met me, my boyfriend, naturally, spent more time with me, so he called me more and her less. They live miles and miles apart. but after about one year into the relationship, things began to change. he called this girl, his best friend, less and the contacted each other less. This girl then started sending him text messages and calling him saying "oh ever since u found your girlfriend, u dont talk to me anymore! you have forgooten me!" she then like says things like "oh good luck in the future" and "dont give up ur friends for anything but give everything up for a friend!" At first i thoight ok, maybe she just wanted the friendship to last between him and her, but now, it seems like she is sometimes luring him to call her by saying really weird things! i have told my boyfriend to keep her as his best friend and to like check up on ur to if she is alright, but she blanks his calls, claims his is avoiding her, sends him aggressive texts, then she apologises for her behaviour!! its like a cycle which happens again and again, but my boyfrind doesnt see it that way? what do u think, am i being to sensitive? or is my boyfriend just so oblivious about it?

20090304135444AAmz0t5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do I am in a confusing Love triangle?	I have been in love with this guy since I was a sophomore in high school and during the summer after that school year we had sex; that was the day our relationship started. Ever since then we have been together and now it has been about four years since we have been together. I really love this guy and want to marry him but he said he cannot marry me because I am not the same caste as him and he wants to listen to his parents first in who they want him to marry but if they do not find him a girl he will marry me. Then he said if I want I can go so I do not have to wait for him. Now the problem there is a guy that is in love with me and wants to marry me. He feels like I am his life and without me he has nothing. He will fight the whole world for me. Spending time with him I realized I am falling for him too. Then recently one thing led to another and I ended up kissing this guy and my the guy I been with for four years found out through his friend (he is currently on vacation out of the country when all this happened). I felt really bad about all this and my four year boyfriend said he will forgive me but I myself feel low in front of him since he accused me of being a cheater and said some harsh things. I really have no idea what to do and which guy is the one I should not let go of!! It is killing me inside and I feel torn!!! ={

20090304143327AAvT4Mh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I explain away the naked lady that daddy was looking at on the computer?  Daddy said oh..umm that was..?	My 8 yr old son got up one night to come into our room and caught Daddy down stairs on the computer looking at a naked lady.  My son came to me because he wanted to ask me about it, because Daddy told him it was nothing and clicked it off quickly.  How do I explain this?  I hate that my husband occasionally looks at porno - but after 10years of marriage - whatever - I get that men are visual and I am very comfortable with our marriage and sex life and myself for that matter. But, when my son ( one of 3 boys ) sees Daddy looking at another woman - My son said it was just weird...   I told him that that's what adult swim was kinda of like that it can sometimes pop up on the computer and is inappropriatefor kids - that is why we don't let them surf the web or TV freely.  We don't want them to feel weird.. that as mommys and daddys we can handle bad language and a naked body. Any other advice anyone?

He flirted with me for 4 months straight i called him out on it and rejected his affections cause he had just been dumped from a 3 year relationship (no one wants to be the rebound girl). He still didn't stop, he would try to hug me, pay for me at movies, lean on me, text me etc. Funny thing is I liked it when he flirted with me. I finally gave in and told him I liked him, but I don't ask out a guys. He shocked me when he said He wants to make sure there is more than physical attraction and that he would never want to hurt me.  :-(     I was ok with his answer cant force anyone to like you, right? I tried to flirt with him and respond to his flirty ways a little, to let him know i was serious about what i said. Then he says it is not going to work!   He has changed his ways completely and is a playfully a Jerk!!! he is mean to me most of the time.but when i'm having a problem he is always there to  hold me and make things all better. His guy friends think he likes me, that is why he is trying to be mean so no one is on to him.     kinda like when we were in elementary school and a boy would kick you and run away cause he liked you.   WHAT is going on!!?!!   Thanks for reading all this drama and giving me some advice. <3

20090227080018AAQ4kAu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I always have to approach people to talk to them.. does this mean they don't really like me that much?	At uni, when i see people i know around campus i always have to be the one to approach them to initiate conversation and stuff.. i have to smile first and ask how they're doing otherwise they'll just ignore me. I would normally think of this as an indication that they don't like me, but when i actually do start talking to them they'll be really nice, seem like they're enjoying my company, laugh and talk back etc. Shall i keep on approaching them outside of classes or do they probably just find me annoying? It's so confusing!

20090304153006AADxP2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you stay in this relationship?	I've been w/ (or WAS w/) my boyfriend for 5yrs. I'm currently 5 months pregnant. We've always talked about having a family & getting married in the next few years. We have a very strong bond.      My only issue is that whenever he needs/wants anything, I'm there. No questions asked, but when I need/want anything it's a HUGE problem! We end up in an enormous argument. I rarely ask him for things .. RARELY, so when I need/want something, it's not on a whim. It's bc I really need/want it. I've spoken to him MANY times regarding this issue. So, I recently called it off 2 days ago following another occurence.      I can see it in his face that he does not want this, but w/ me being pregnant, I feel he needs to be stepping it up & WANTING to help me since it's gotten to the point where I really do need his help. This was happening even before I got pregnant.      He's 20. I'm 21.      Would you stay?      THANKS!      ( PS - I asked this a few hours ago & only ask again to get a few more opinions. )

20090304150231AApOrLy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What's your advice on telling my dad I take Aderall?	I really want to tell my Dad I take Adderall sometimes during the week (whenever I can get any) to focus more and do my work in school. That's the only reason I take them. When i'm not on them I don't pay attention and I don't do my work and now my grades have turned into F's and as a result I got my phone taken away. Aderall helps me allot and I would really like to ask my Dad for a prescription and explain to him how it works. The only problem is is that my dad is almost 100% against pills except for vitamins and aspirins because my Mother is addicted to prescription pills and has almost died twice. My dad knows that, because of my Mother and allot of other family members who have addictions, I am at a higher risk than others to be addicted to anything I try since I have the bad genes in my family. How can I explain to him I only use it for school and that it helps out a ton? I only take 2 tablets and it works great. Thank you in advance.

Usually, he'll glance at me, so he knows when I'm near him. He never talks to me. Though, we rarely talked before christmas break but ever since we never talk to eachother.  When I'm around him he's more quiet, but in reality he's more of the flirty troublemaker type of guy.    Why does he act differently around me?

20090304145859AAgT5YE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it wrong to put so much faith into a second proposal?	I got engaged the first time when I was 17. I was sincerely in love with my boyfriend. The proposal sucked for lack of a better word. It wasn't a surprise - he didn't even get down on one knee. Just kind of handed me a box and said "there you go". He still referred to me as his girlfriend. The relationship didn't work out. I'm in a new relationship now and we've slowly started to talk about marriage. I'm not jumping the gun here - if it happens in a year or two, it happens, and I'll be thrilled.      What I'm curious about is whether it's right to be putting so much hope into having the "perfect" engagement. I felt like I missed out the first time - not only did the proposal stink but the relationship was terrible as well. Is it wrong to put so much faith into a second proposal?       I hope this question makes sense. I'm just worried I'm putting too much emphasis on the proposal. I just want it to be great, and I know he's the right guy.

20090304145801AA90miA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you be so nice to give me your honest opinion?	I'm going with my ex as a friend.  However, in many occasion he tells me that he can not come because he is waiting for an UPS package and this is very often.  Yesterday he invited me to go out and he called and cancelled because it was raining and asked me if  we could leave it for tomorrow and I said it was OK.  Then he called me again later and cancelled  because he was waiting for an UPS again and asked me if could wait after the UPS.  I told him "I let you know.  To tell you the true I feel like a second hand and I thought, then I called him back and told him to leave it for another day since something came up and I did not know if I was going to be here.  He was surprised and said oh you don't want to go? and I explained to him is not that I don't want to go is that something came up I did not know at what time I will be home.  I told him OK another time, but I feel better doing this because if I have a compromise with the friend, I would not cancel twice.  He goes to see his brother every week end and I really getting tire.  He is never available in the week end, so why should be available for him?   What do you think?

20090304152321AABQ3og	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was I too 'easy to get'?	It usually takes a lot for me to fall for a guy, but someone I have been good friends with for a few years, and we dated a bit in the past, I am in love with. I feel so deeply connected to him and consider him a soulmate.      We weren't together for awhile because he insisted that he wasn't good enough and had nothing to offer me - but that when he did achieve some personal goals, he would be at my door. I wondered, an excuse, or is he for real?      Well I told him all of my feelings and really let him know I was crazy about him. I'm sure I've always acted these feelings and he has known.      His response was that he can't accept things that are right in front of him, things that are easy to get. I feel like I was too available, maybe. Put own self in the friend zone.       Is this excuse any good? If I want him, should I drop a little contact? Or should I just remain friends because nothing is likely to happen?
20090304151534AAjL3Uz	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I get past awkward greetings?	There is someone in my class that's a friend, but we haven't talked in a while. It feels awkward to say hi every time I go to class, and I mostly just avoid doing it. I want to talk to her, but I can't even say hi to her because I feel like it there will just be an awkward pause afterward.        I am usually only close enough to her to say hi after the class is over anyway because I usually come to class at the last minute and sit on the other side of the room. So it sounds stupid to say hi because we are departing. Saying bye is stupid because I haven't said hi yet...      I know it's a complicated and long question, but I could really use advice on what to do.

So why do you think she cums faster? I hear women get off from emotions. Is it because shes in love with me? Don't get me wrong, i am NOT complaining. Means im good in bed, but i just want to know if any of you women out there know?
20090304153020AAI1TPr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you married women meet new friends?	I'm married, and have no interest in befriending anyone of the opposite sex.      I'm interested in finding some new female friends.  I really only have 2.  I work from home so I don't have the chance to meet anyone at work.  It's a long story but I don't have any old friends from highschool because I became ill and was bedridden for 2 years at the age of 16, so I lost all of them.      Anyway, I'm looking to meet some new friends to hang out with, but I don't have any interest in the partying lifestyle like most women my age (I'm 24.)  I'm married and settled down, and just looking for some girl friends.  Or, some couple friends for myself and my husband to hang out with.      Thanks! :)         *Note: I can't meet anyone in gym, yoga, etc or anything like that because I am disabled.  Not in a wheelchair or anything, but I cannot do rigorous physical activity, I have a chronic pain disorder.
20090227080638AAqZzuY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if this was you?	Hey, im so fed up of my friend going on and on about this.....and was wondering what the people of YA! thought about it!       imagine this scene 4 months ago, your partner of 5 years tells you she has been sleeping with the neighbour - it only happened twice but she is really sorry and now its all out in the open she wants to try and move on together as a couple, of course your angry, and upset and want to lash out, and you make her sleep on the sofa - fair enough....you then tell her after a few days that you do want to split up because of this and that you dont like people who cheat and go and find somewhere else to live    this couple have a 4 year old btw :)    Anyways she goes to the local housing office and gets on the list to be housed, and all she hears from him is when you going, have you found a house yet, have you applied for any more houses etc etc etc they have had some good times over the past 5 months but she got housed yesterday and shes taken the property!! and shes moving in, but last night he decided he wants her to stay and work it all out and it will be better (btw the neighbour is accross the road still) and everything...he has been a bit of a control freak with her so im worried thats what this is and she will crack and stay      So my question is....what would you do? would you go and start again with the 4 year old and be like well you didnt want to work it out, you've had 4 months to basically tell me you want to work it out but you'venot bothered and all you have done is say we're not a couple anymore etc etc or would you give your new place up and stay and work it out even tho it may not get any better      my friend has a decision, hes just not accepting it!       cheers xx

In study hall we sit right across from each other and we usually just talk and stuff but as of late I've had work that I've actually had to do, so we haven't talked. When I was doing work she did things to get my attention like tapping my foot with hers, putting on make up, flaunting herself, random sighs. Well, as much as I wanted to talk to her I had to finish this stuff cause I want to do good in school. Now that all my work is done shes kind of trying to avoid talking to me, such as asking questions to everyone else but me and etc.

20090227080403AAL5XAc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can anyone estimate a dressmakers charge for making this dress?	 http://www.freudianslipsvintage.com/dres...       This is a dress I've been pining for for ages now. I've investigated avenues such as finding a similar one cheaply online and making one myself (or at least the skirt).    I'm now thinking that taking this set of pictures to a dressmaker would be best, although this is not an imminent thing, just something I'd like to do.   I'm aware that I will probably have to buy the necessary fabric myself, but can anyone give a vague idea as to how much I would be paying a dressmaker on top of that? Any hidden charges I should know about?      Thank you

When we told her we were getting married in November, she tried convincing him to wait until next year. My birthday was three days ago and I still have not received a card from her. Normally I wouldn't care, but I can't help but associate her comments about us getting married with her not liking me, which is why she did not send me a card. Am I being totally irrational in my thought process or would you be a bit put off too?

20090304152659AA4DS71	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	With girls,Is it better to be someone who's always nice, someones who kids around a lot, or someone whose cool?	By nice i'm talking about like doing everything you can for people, never putting them down, just being really nice and mannered all the time. By joking I meant that when Im around girls, i'll joke and i'll be sorta rude to them, but in a playful way - they never get angry, actually not rude but i'll make fun of them quite a lot and they always laugh at it. Or someone whose cool, whose not phased by a beautiful girl, and doesnt really care about girls, he'll talk to them but do them no favours, treat them like everybody else? Which one you think?

20090304144737AAV1yeK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women's View---DID I CHEAT ON MY GF ?	i've been with my GF for 10months now and we live together. Yesterday her best friend/female came over the apartment for me to fix her laptop. My Gf was at class when she came over.  She comes to the apartment dressed like she's going to hit the dance club. It was about 5:30pm. She has a killer body like Kim Kardashian and her boobs were just falling out practically when i opened the door.  Anyhow i take her to study-room and begin working on her laptop. She begins to sit on my lap under the pretense of "wanting to learn how to fix the laptop". I excuse her and grab a chair for her to sit next to me.  10min, later she says she has a kink in her back and was wondering if she could stretch a bit. I'm like "fine. go ahead" . She then get's up and STANDS INFRONT OF THE DEKS turns around with her AZZ facing me and begins to bend over!!! This goes on for about 8min. Then she comes and sits next to me scoots her chair super close and is breathing down my neck. Now i'm fully hard. like rock hard. She notices it as I stand up to give back her laptop. She says and i quote "Let me thank you." unties the threads of her dress, dress falls down, she's naked and gets on her knees."       NOTHING HAPPENED. But i did pick her up over my shoulder laid her on my lap naked and gave her a Spanking in the Living-Room. I thought if im aroused so will this ******. By the time i hit the last spank of 40 she was dripping wet. Picked her up again on my shoulders grabbed her clothes/laptop and put her outside my Apt and locked the Door. Calls me names from behind the door " Your an Azzhole. You must be Gay. u don't know what your missing." blah blah blah.      I told my GF everything when she came. And now she's upset and hasn't spoken to me since last night. What I did was it CHEATING !!???????

20090304150523AAxPsUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What a JERK..... what do you think..?	I recently started dating this guy and he saw a tattoo on my wrist. It said "R.I.P scott" and he said it was trashy and disgusting even after i told him it's the only tattoo that i will ever get and it is in memory of my brother that passed away. He called me a wh ore, a scumbag and left and hasn't called me all because of a tattoo that means a lot to me. That was extremely disrespectful. I feel like he disrespected me and my brother. I am no longer EVER going to communicate with him again.  What do you think of this guy?

20090227080523AA85jRK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Will she ever realize that she can do better? How can I get my best friend back?	My best friend has been dating this guy for almost 2 years now. He's not a nice guy at all. He won't let her hang out with her friends so when she sees me or any of her other friends (which is hardly ever) she has to lie to him, he hits her and he calls her the most disgusting names.       She will never fight back or leave him. She has broken up with him a couple of times but never for longer than a month. Why does she go back to him? She fell pregnant with his child and he kicked her in the stomach (needless to say, the child was never born).      Everyone tells her that she can do so much better and that he's no good for her. So many other guys I know that are great guys would do anything to date her. Why won't she listen to anyone? What should I do?
20090304153040AA64STM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whoa! What just happened here?	Ok,  a few months ago I just realized I was a bisexual and I liked this guy and a girl.

I suddenly realized that in gym class with him, I had no feelings for him anymore and felt really strongly for the girl. I also feel I have no feelings for guyz anymore? What just happened?

I understand people who like to remain to themselves but JEEEZ!!! How can you live with someone and not say a word to them? I'm a quiet and reserved person and I can understand quiet people but this is just ridiculous. I'm in another country by myself and I was hoping I'd have a cool roommate but she sucks.... She has a few friends and interacts with them nicely so I don't know why she's like this with me.

20090304143758AAcH0wO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me? (long question but I'm in serious need of help)?	So here's the deal...i have the reputation of being a good girl. I'm really involved with my church and everything, and i pretty much never date anyone because i have pretty high standards. I'm 16 and i haven't had my first kiss..so yeah lol   well there's this guy in one of my classes. He is the exact opposite of what I would normally look for in a guy, and he's not a virgin, he cusses, etc. but he doesn't drink or do grugs or anything. Before I was in this class with him, i thought he was kind of quiet and "cool", but being in this class with him i realize he is hilarious, and I find myself extremely attracted to him, but I can't tell if he would be interested in me. He always talks to me in that class, and he always always hits on me, but he's an extreme goofball and everyone pretty much just laughs at him. However, I've noticed that he hits on me more than other girls in the class...his actual seat is across the room from me, but he always ends up sitting near me and talking to me and my friends. He's always joking and stuff, saying this like, "hey baby can I have your number?" just goofy stuff like that, and I'm always like whatever and I start laughing. because it's hard to tell if he's serious...like what if i were to give him my number and he was like, i was just kidding.... you know? But the day before yesterday he called his number from my phone and was like, why is my number in your phone? he was joking around, and I was like whatever bryan, you just did that i saw you. it wasn't until yesterday that i realized maybe he did that so he could get my number. It's just really hard to tell if he's interested or not..I mean i can't see him going for a girl like me, but he always winks at me and calls me his girlfriend stuff. Today after school he caught up to me and was like, why didn't you wait for me? You're my girlfriend we're supposed to walk together..and i just laughed and everything. I can't tell if he's interested! Help?!

Long story short, I really liked him. He took me to the homecoming dance, and a week later, told me he'd rather be "friends". He hasn't talked to me for 7 months. He has a new girlfriend now, and shes a good friend of mine. (she didnt go to the school when i went out with him, so everythings cool with her, not like she stole him or anything) but I still don't have a boyfriend.

20090304153104AA2WiNq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Asked her out, now she's my girlfriend, but not really talking to me / avoiding me?	[Sorry - it turned out to be long]      Hey everyone. So, there is this girl which I've known for a few months, I really like her, we've become friends and since the beginning she always showed clear signs of interest. She'd always hold my arm, be happy when seeing me and invite me to hang out with her, for example.      It took me a while but I finally gathered up enough courage to ask her out last week. She was surprised but agreed to go on a date with me, saying "sounds like fun", she then gave me her home phone number.       Then the next day (friday) I call her to discuss details. She said she was too busy this weekend, but we could go on a date next weekend. However, she also told me she actually wants to meet up this weekend on saturday, at school after her exam, because she'd rather tell me in person than on the phone what she has to say. So, the next day we meet up and she basically says that if we are to go out together, we'd have to hide it from her parents, so I have to call only at certain hours or rather she must call me, or we communicate via text/email. So, I told her I don't really have a problem with this (I expected this since I knew her parents didn't want her dating anyone).      After that, she asked me if I was her first girlfriend. This surprised, because she already considers us boyfriend / girlfriend even though we haven't gone on a date together yet? Anyway, I guess this makes sense because we were already friends and somewhat close. She also said after our little conversation that "this will be interesting...", kind of cold, as if this was an experiment with an uncertain outcome that would be 'interesting' to do?      Anyway, this isn't too important. The thing is we haven't really talked since last saturday (today is wednesday). I texted her a bit but she barely answers. Then yesterday on tuesday we had class together. She arrived late, sit in the back, and after class left before I even had time to notice. This is unusual because usually we would always talk together in class or at the very least after class. Now I didn't even get to say hi and she's supposed to be my girlfriend?      I texted her after class just to say hi because I didn't get to see her in class. She answered back saying she was planning to sit with me but got there late and said perhaps I should consider sitting further back next time (I was in the front row). Kind of a cold answer too.      Anyway, it's just that it's somewhat confusing because she used to be so enthusiastic around me and now that I asked her out it's like she doesn't care or it's a joke?      Maybe I'm reading too much into this... perhaps things will go well after  our first date...      Of course I can't ask you guys to guess what is in her mind... I guess I just needed to talk about it.      What should I do? Is it best to just keep on waiting until we see each other again and not make any special effort to contact her?      Thanks

20090304151050AADcY0d	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think my husband is treating me bad, but I'm wondering what others think?	My husband recently told me he's going to start meeting with two of his friends at a bar every Friday afternoon and then be home around the usual time (But groggy from drinking, of course--so much for going out Friday night.) Last Friday I happened to be in the area of the bar where he was, 3 miles away. I had ridden in with him in the morning to go to a conference, and my event was now done at 4, with just the janitors left. I called him and said I was ready to be picked up. He said no, he was going to stay at the bar with his friends for awhile. I said, why don't you pick me up and we can go back to the bar together? He said angrily, "No," and hung up on me. An hour and a half later, he showed up. Prior to this event there has been verbal abuse over the many years we've been married. There is also very little affection. Due to what happened last Friday, I haven't spoken to him for nearly a week, except when absolutely necessary, and he has made no effort to apologize. I am hurt to be treated like a second- or third-class citizen, like garbage. Does anyone have any suggestions??

20090304150446AA0f7XV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?? EASY 10 POINTS!!!?	Please read, you dont have to you could skim if you want just pls answer      this guy (in my art class) i only have one class with him. I have caught him staring at me a few times (Im talking loooong stares) and if i walk behind him in the hallway, he seems to always turn his whole head around and looks at me and look at me or see from the corner of his eye if im behind him.         Hes shy and never talks to me. I think hes too scared too. H egets shy and somewhat nervous. He avoids my eye and fixes his hood or something when im there. When i dont see him he looks at me a lot.       Sometimes he even looks keeps lookin at the door until i come in. He gets nervous around me sometimes too. He ignores me when i look at him but when im not, he looks at me even if its a glance.       btw we're both juniors.       sometimes he touches his elbows liek rubs them or scratches his face.. idk if they're real signs      after class i was walking behind him and he kept turning around looking at me. I thought first that he was looking behind for his friends or something but he cant have cause he did it too often adn does it liek everyday.       When at his locker, he turns his head ever so slightly at looks at me. Or in the hallway if i go past him, he looks at me or looks straight ahead cause i would end up passing from in front of him.   During demonstrations in art, if i have to go over to his table, and sit like across from him he never looks up, except if he thinks im not looking but i have a feeling he sees me from the corner of his eye.      Once i stood behind him and he turned twice to look at me. He made it seem like he was lookin at the clock, but no one looks at the clock like 2 or three times in a row. You'd know what it says the first time.      The other day he was looking at me and I smiled and today it seemed like he looked at me much more often.      You think he likes me?? Please answer. Your help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
20090304152717AAh8LDv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He CONSTANTLY brings this up, WHY?! 10 pts best answer....?	Hey there, I'm in my early twenties, and I have been having a casual relationship with a guy. We dated over the summer, but it ended quite badly. Almost a year later, we have made amends, became friends, and then started to hook up. My feelings for him are minimal, and at the start of it all, I made it clear I didn't want to date him anytime soon. He responded by saying that he doesn't want a relationship either.      This whole situation started over a month ago, and we have been fine. Things didn't feel serious, we don't text all the time, and sometimes go days without talking. This doesn't bug me, what bugs me is, how now, each time we see each other (once or twice a week), he keeps stating how he can't have a relationship. Each time! I have told him repeatedly that I'm fine with it, I don't want one either, and once I even asked him to stop saying it!      I don't want a relationship, but if it was progressing there, I wouldn't complain.   I just don't get why he keeps bringing it up?      BTW,   I know him, and I know he wants the freedom and doesn't want to be tied down, so please don't point that out. It's just he constantly states it, or randomly throws it into conversation, and I'm like....OK?, I got it a month ago.

20090304152108AA3haHy	Family & Relationships;Family	Pregnant and have a serious issue with mother in law what to do?	im 7 weeks pregnant and have told my family becuase i want all the support i can get with my first child. my brothers girlfriend is also pregnant which is good it take the spotlight off me.      weve told my partners younger brother and asked that he doesnt tell his mother which he understands. but the mother is goin to be trouble and i know it.       my partner only wants to tell her because he knows that she will cause a big fight if we dont tell her but on the other hand if we do she will stress me to the max with her sh!t she dribbles like i shouldnt eat wheat becuase the baby will be wheat intolerent becuase my partner is apprently wheat intolerant (which he isnt hes perfectly healthy he acid was caused by stress and guess where the stress comes from)      anyway. whats the best approach to handling her. i dont really wanna deal with her since im very moody and ill just start abusing her even use the c word im that nasty at the moment. shes a bad mother and thinks there is nothing wrong with what she did ( eg she hit my partner when he was 10 in the head with a rolling pin out of anger, she never told him who is father was but denyin her rights to her grand child thats wrong and not the same thing she has rights to her grandchildren but he had no rights to his child)      so we live in different states but we wanna start visitng my mother with the child so that it gets to know its family and i just know she will make special trips up just to see it. i personally dont want her influence on my child. i know what its like to have a horrible grandmother and i dont want my children to feel that resentment.      so whats your opinion on the situation       do we tell her. (mind you we cant contact her she changes numbers like underwear but i bet as soon as the baby word gets out shell be on the phone like a blue a$$ fly)      how do i make this less stressful for me and limit the impact on my child?      i know its long winded with it goin nowhere but any advice would be helpful

Last year, we were friends, but she was in to bad things like skipping class, violence, cussing WAY too much, and stealing. She got me cussing a lot, too, and considering (but not actually) skipping. Now, for most other people, this would be no big deal, but my long-term goals include a good education, and I'm 110% dead set on these goals. I became aware that I was becoming more like her when my best friend at the time (and still a good friend now) told me she didn't like the way I was starting to act. So, I warned Sav that she should stop doing all this stuff. Of course, she refused. I became more and more worried that I would get more and more like her, and possibly end up in jail later in life (or juvie now). I decided it would be better for my future and my family's emotions if I stopped being friends with her.      Now, she tells everyone that I just ditched her, and she was just this perfect little friend that never did anything wrong, and if she did, I never told her. And remember, this was all AFTER the fact that I explained what I didn't like about her, and she refused to change her behavior. Now, I'm not saying I'M 100% innocent either. I do know I was a ***** to her for "ditching" her last year, and any time I think about it, the guilt kills me, and the fact that I hurt her so much that SHE would want to physically hurt me back makes the guilt so much worse that I hurt her bad enough to want to do that to me.      Sorry for this being so long, and thanks for reading it. So what do you think I should do about the guilt, the fear, getting her not to be mad at me, and protection until she forgives me?

20090304144611AA6NJzO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested?

20090227081055AATc0ib	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can someone grow to love an arranged marriage partner?	If I were to go to another country and successfully arrange myself a marriage to the daughter of a Slavic family, do you think she would ever truly love me in her heart or feel a connection with me. I'd treat her nice, I'd let her avoid the hardships of employment by being the financial provider, and I'm make every night filled with romance. I'd show her that I care about her and want to give her a good life. I have my personal and spiritual reasons why I want to arrange myself a marriage instead of dating. One of my reasons is because I want a future wife to only think of me when we kiss and make love (The way it was when traditional royalty got married) and so we can have an intimate bond with one another. Statistics show that about 100,000 slavic women (ages 16-30) are sold as sex slaves and many go into it unwillingly because they want to escape poverty or other conditions. So, if I were to arrange myself a marriage to a Slavic woman, I know I'd be doing charity by saving her life and finding myself someone to love.(I'm a Christian, just in case you're wondering)      And before you criticize my motives, here are some things to consider.      "50% of all marriages in the America end in divorce."   "Arranged marriages are often said to be more stable than love marriages. "   "10/12/2008---   As of today, nearly 70% of Ukrainians live behind the poverty line.....   According to Nina Karpachova, namely 70% of the Ukrainian population live at not more than $3 per day, by criteria of the World Bank......"   "This month [March 12, 2007] Russia's orthodox church warned that the gulf between the rich and poor was growing wider, with some 20% of Russians below the poverty line. There is still no real middle-class and there is a significant gap between urban and rural life, the church said, warning: "Russia possesses between 30% and 40% of the earth's resources. Revenues from exports of natural resources built the stabilisation fund. But only a very small part of society is getting richer. It is doing so at a pace that amazes even some of the richest people in the world. On the other hand, the majority of the population lives in destitution."   “Sex before marriage ruins marriage. If you marry someone who has had multiple partners, there will always be an underlying comparison to their past experience making marriage insecure."

20090304152721AAmG9qX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give up now or hope it works out?	I've been with my boyfriend for 3 months but we've known each other over a year, we're in the same year at uni. Today he told me he's quitting one of the modules and restarting it next year, so he's going to be at uni for an extra year than I am. When I graduate I had planned on moving away with him (we'd only talked about it a bit but we both agreed that by the time we graduated we'd probably go live together in a different city) but this news could change things (assuming we're still together, we're very happy though and so we really could still be together). Should I break up with him now before it gets even harder to lose him (I'm not sure we'll last through him staying an extra year at uni)? Or should I stick it out and just hope it'll all be ok, as surely if we love each other that much we'll make it work?

It's been about a week since me and my ex boyfriend broke up.   We both obviously still have feelings for each other (i know i still love him, he SAYS he does but his actions dont show it), we still text everyday but he will stop answering or his answers are like he's being forced to keep talking to me. (Shows he doesnt still love me like he says)   But, we talked about whats gonna happen with us, he said he wants us to be friends with benefits (we arent having sex, so just kissing) and I say no.      I want him back so bad but he doesnt seem like it,   What should I do? What are our options? Do you think he still likes me?      The other night he said he was still in love with me and will always love me he just wants best for him right now.      its hard to be friends if i still have these feeling for him,   and it would be too hard to just forget him completely

20090227080107AAYVvOH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Any opinions or advice?	Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm

20090227080306AAiRtmS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Unhappily Married Woman?	I've been unhappily married for quite a while now.  Long story short, we met in 1997, I got pregnant & had son in 1998, & we got married 4 months before son was born.  We separated for 6 months because he seemed incredibly selfish to me.  My view is this: when you marry a woman, you cherish and adore her and she'll do the same for you. He's not a "touchy feely" type of person, doesn't kiss very well... just in general doesn't treat me like I think a good man should treat his wife.  Now, he's a good provider & good father to our two kids... but that's it. If I ask him for gas money or money to get my hair done or just something for me, he looks at me like I have a 3rd eye on my forehead! He pays for all of our utilities & 1/2 of the mortgage. I pay the other half.  My complaint??  He doesn't take care of ME. Call it selfish if you must, but he works 3rd shift so all parenting is left to me (shuttling back & forth to sports games, practices, band rehearsals, sleepovers, etc.), and all cleaning and cooking.  We don't have a "sex life"... it's MAYBE once a month. We don't have other married friends over because he doesn't have very good social skills (my opinion). When he introduces himself to people, he does a James Bond rendition of his name (and he's not joking). He doesn't take advice from anyone, uses his parents as babysitters when HE wants but if they just want to pick up the kids, he has to "think about it". He dresses in the same clothes he had when he was a freshman in college so IF we go out he looks dreadful, hasn't purchased ONE single piece of jewelry for me (except the cheap wedding ring where the stones fell out), doesn't get regular hair cuts, has hair bumps on his face (we're black and it looks horrible), doesn't wear cologne... he's just NOT what I want.  Why do I stay??  Because we have two children 9 & 10 and I couldn't afford it if I did leave.  I left before in 2001, but went back because in this case - it's cheaper to keep him.      I need advice. Should I find a little sumthin' sumthin' on the side? Deal with it until the kids are gone, then jet? Oh - one last thing... we have gone to counseling after we got back together in 2001. He doesn't like to "tell people his business" so it didn't work.  His own family doesn't even know what he does for a living! I've told his parents what he does, but he doesn't want them knowing his cell phone number, he NEVER likes his mail to come to our home address so he's used a PO Box since I've known him... when I look at him my first thought is "You are so raggedy and I don't know WHAT I saw in you. If someone gave me money to leave or if I won the lottery, I'd be gone tomorrow."  Honestly, I don't think it would matter to him if I left, but he'd fight tooth and nail for the kids.

20090304150242AAqmEN4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who was wrong? My friend or me?	I'm SORRY! I know this is very long! but nothing I could really do to shorten this.   Ok, my friend has not talked to me for, about 6 months now (going to be on the 11th of March)   Probally every friendship, eventually a fight occurs. (we had a few meaningless, over nothing ones) All summer, my friend constantly asked me if I wanted to hang out. (sleepover, movie, beach, and so on.) And her best friend, has relatives in India, so she was away all summer. Thought the whole summer, we hung out, then my mom invites her and her mom the the Sight and Sound Theater in Pennsylvania. So we went and had a lot of fun. Then her friend from comes back. We are both fans of the Jonas Brothers, her mom gets tickets. Even though she came with me to Pennsylvania, she invited her friend from India who go with her to the concert. For a while I kept my mouth shut and did not say anything. While at my best friends house for a sleepover for her birthday(her birthday is mid-July), I decide to tell her how I felt. I said "I feel like a fill-in for your friend. I invite you somewhere and you didn't invite me,(common curtsy someone invites you somewhere, you should invite them somewhere, right?) you invited her to the concert, and your mom got the tickets." and she was like: "How can you say that! I do not do that! Do you think I have other friends too? I hang around with all my friends, not just you." me-" I don't feel like arguing, I'm tired, I got no sleep last night, I am at my friends house and you know that! Can we talk tomorrow?" and she was like "Fine." So tomorrow comes and she doesn't answer me. She stopped talking to me for a long time. Then in the end of July she asked me'Do you want to go to the roller skating rink tonight? Or are you too tired to come?' (throwing back what I said to her to me) but then she invited me to the roller skating rink, by texting me. My phone did not recieve the text untill the following day at noon. So I call her and ask her " Why did you ask me if I wanted to go to the rink today? When you went there last night?" and she was like"You said your phone was off, so thats why you just got the text today." me-" My phone was off when I fell asleep at one, it was on all day besides when I shut it off to charge it."  Then she ignored me for a long time, untill September. I i/med her dad by accident, when I ment to i/m someone I just added on aim. I said " HI! how's everyone?" her dog recently died, and her mom got really sick. I did not get a reply, but the following day she i/med me on her screen name: 'Y DID YOU i/m MY DAD?'  I said pretty much what I explained. and she got annoyed at me for talking to her dad when she was mad at me. then she goes on a rampage saying why did u im my dad? i dont believe you! and the last thing she said to me was this(I am copying this from what she said) 'ok well i hope ur mom is ok but if ur going to keep doing this to me i will forget all about u and delet u from my aim buddy list bc from this moment on we r no longer friends. im srry but thsi is teh way it has to be.. i just cant keep doing this... all of these fights has made such a mark on my life that i cant take it any longer so... im done... done with u, this conversation, and i am going to start new with you out of my life, we can be friendly at gs meeting but not friends, we r now, n how this convo has gone, nd forevr not friends. im srry. good bye'       who was wrong? me or her? why?

When i was 5 my parents separated.   I went back and fore wards constantly.   My mother did drugs, i did them with her when i was 9, i also did get drunk with her once or twice. I stopped after a while cos something didn't seem right. Then i had freedom,   i haven't seen my mom in 4-5 years.   i miss her and the judge said im allowed to have phone contact regardless of what my dad and step mom say.

20090304145251AAMM3Su	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she my friend???????????????????????	Okay. So a friend and I were at a little interval in our friendship.    A while ago we were having some problems. Nothing really big tho.   She was one of my best friends, and I usually sat with her on the bus.   So, as usual, I sat with her on the bus. The first few minutes I talked to her, but she wouldn't say anything. Because of  this, I also went silent for the whole 40 minute bus ride. I didn't feel as if I should push myself onto someone that didn't want to talk to me.   I haven't talked to her for two months - at all.    Then today, when I went on the bus, I sat with her.   It annoyed me not being friends with someone and not saying anything.   I talked with her, being friendly and polite.   She was obviously surprised  that I would sit with her, and uncomfortable until I started explaining things.    I asked how she was, how her vacation went.    She replied that she was fine, and asked how I was, in a cautious way.   I asked her why she hadn't come to Writing Club in a while, and she said that she thought that people didn't want her there, and  then went over how she thought that I was really mad at her, hated her, and wanted to 'kill her'. I asked her who said that, and she said 4 people that I would never say anything like that or spill my guts to. In that manner, I told her that, and that they must be lying.      We talked about how it was sad that we missed two months of our lifes, and how it was nice to talk again. We talked about random things.      Now, see, this friend of mine has a tendancy to lie a lot. A LOT.      However, I still thought it went really well, and was happy that we were on speaking terms and friends again, even tho not as much as before.      When I got home, I started doing my homework, and then, because I was bored, I checked my email. There was an email from my ex bf, who's now going out with her.      "What are you doing to ---------. Do you have any idea what you are doing to her. Please leave her alone. What the hell is your problem --------."      (The ---- are names.)      Reading this message, I was hurt and confused. I called my ex and asked him what it was about, very calmly and surprisingly patient. At first he was reluctant to leak any information about what he was hearing, and just kept saying "I don't know. Just what you've been saying to her." To loosen up the tension and to make him feel more comfortable to talk, I repeated my side of  the story - everything I said, everything I heard, everything I thought and observed.       Eventually he started asking me if I said that, or if I did that. All of my answers were flat No's. Because, in fact, I had not done/said any of the following:   "Were you leaving her messages on Deviantart calling her names?"   "Were you calling her a b**** and such?"   "Did you call me a ***?"      I was so insulted by the last question - I would never, besides using it as an example as this, use that word. I'll say gay - but never that.      He went on to ask things to confirm if I had been doing things. It was just a whole lot of rumours.      The thing is, she said all of these things. I'm so confused, and I don't want to have to disprove myself on everything he's hearing.      I'm not even sure he believes me when I say that I didn't do any of those things. However, I think I replied in such a calm and honest way that he actually believes it, at least somewhat.      If you were me, what would you do? It's just so screwed up.      Thank you SOOO much!! :)
20090304145517AAXhM23	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do You Think I Did the Right Thing?	Me and my boyfriend dated for almost 6 months...but we did everything together. Well, until about 2 months ago hes been miserable for no reason, and hes always angry. I tried to help him, but nothing seemed to help. I was his everything, he treated me like a princess and all he saw was me. I could not take it anymore because he was constantly angry/depressed, so I ended it. He hasnt talked to me since, but I only asked for a break. Heres the pros and cons of him, all summed up.   Pros:   1. He treated me like I was his everything.   2. He showed me off in public, and introduced me as his girlfriend.   3. He always was there for me...he'd rush to my house when I was sick, and showed up with flowers.   4. He would do anything for me, honestly.      Cons:   1. He had an explosive anger problem.   2. He dressed kinda gothic...and had ear gauges, tattoos...yeah.   3. He never tried to impress my parents, ever!   4. Nothing seemed to make me happy aside from me.      Did I do the right thing by breaking up with him? Or should I have stayed with him...?      Also, I lost my virginity to him so that was also hard to give up.      Thank you.

Then later that day she was looking at me (but not annoyed or sad) Can anyone tell me what she might be thinking?

20090304145136AAzrWeQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Some of my friends think I'm gay.?	Okay, so here's how it goes. Some of my friends think I'm gay. I'm a 14 year old guy. I'm not gay in any way. However, I will stand up for gay people. I don't appreciate gay jokes. I also have a friend who is gay. My only concern is that people think I'm gay. I mean I might have that typical "gay" stereotype on two things. 1. My best friend is a girl and 2. I have longish hair down to just above my shoulders. Having either of these things doesn't make me gay if I remember correctly. Also some people think I'm gay because I am respectful of girls and many of my friends are girls so I know how they work. I don't discriminate. Many of my closest friends are girls, including my best friend. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be thought of as gay. And I want to be liked by girls. I see my guy friends getting girls while I remain everyone's eternal best friend. This could be because they think I'm gay? I'm really not sure. Help please.

20090304152309AAiAH1E	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i have lost my job...  hundreads of opinions welcome!!!?	Ok hi! My names Amy im female, 19 and live in adelaide, australia.   I just got fired from a job I have had for 2 and a half years. Its 15 for 3 hours (terrible) and it was a hobby and home more then a job. I worked at the noarlunga ice sports centre every friday night for 2 and a half years. Last friday, I got fired because the following happened...      A guy named tyson who's a complete twat that everyone hates (not to mention causes more trouble on the ice then most) came into the rink. I hate him but I don't mind his family. So he's sister calls me and asks if she came ice skating would I be able to drive her home? I say yeh ok. Then I notice tyson rocks up and I went to him and said hey dude why can't you take your sister home?    He says (didn't even say hi back or answer my question) what's that dirty filth **** giving me that dirty filthy **** look for?    I said who daly? (Its common knowlage that daly and tyson hate eachother)    He says no, that dirty filthy **** right there, timmy.   (Timmy is my fiance and quite the quiet fellow)   And I said excuse me how dare you speak about tim to me and in front of kids talk such filth like that!!!!   And he says well his a dirty filthy ****!!!!    So I slapped his face like a girl does and he went and had a cry to the owner and got me fired. There's more to it but that's the facts. My boss said grab your stuff and leave the premesis (she didn't like me much anyway cause I talk too much) and I left. The kids there lodged a petition to get me back but I don't care... I just can't believe I lost my job over a ******** like him. Everybody hates him and I hate the c word and I guess I just snapped. he's 21 and older then me and nothing happened to him...      Should I have lost my job?
20090304150927AAJqZgf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My new girlfriend says she doesn't "feel" anything when we kiss, what does this MEAN??!?	She says she's never felt anything when she kisses anyone before, that's why she's never been in a real relationship before.  She would just think there wasn't any chemistry with that person so she would break it off.      Now with me, she tells me that maybe there is something wrong with HER because she loves spending time with me, but doesn't get why she doesn't feel anything when we kiss.  We've kissed like twice, btw.  And she says she doesn't want to hurt my feelings, whatever that means.  What should I do?  Break it off before I get more involved and eventually hurt? Or keep with it?      Please help me, oh wise gods of Yahoo! Answers!!!!

Anyway, I fell in love with this college I want to go to and I really want to go there and it's only 3 hours away from my parents. Well, my parents want me to go to the college that's right down the street from them. So, I told my parents that I really love this college that I want to go to and that's where my heart is at. My parents are mad at me b/c they don't want to see their little girl move away. I don't want to break their hearts and them be mad at me, nor do I want to go to a college I know I'll be miserable at. What do you think I should do? I'm sorry this is kinda long. Also, the college my dad is wanting me to go to is the same one most of my family has gone to.

20090304152202AAhd1ih	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think spanking your kids is ok?	I hear people saying that spanking is violent all the time, and what I've noticed is that there are alot of brats now. I dont think that kids should be spanked all the time, but if they have done something really bad, then yeah, they should get a spanking. And i don't consider it abuse unless it leaves a mark, or if the person doing it is angry. When I would get spankings, I would be told that when dad got home, I was gonna get one. I remember waiting in my room, dreading it. The wait was always much worse than the actual spanking. And my dad would always make sure I understood what I was being spanked for. There are alot of kids that are brats because all their parents do is yell at them, the kids never learn to respect their parents or other people. (I'm not saying that all kids who aren't spanked turn out that way, just alot.) My sister has six kids, and you never hear her yell at their kids. They are all under the age of 9, and we always have people saying that they are some of the best behaved kids they have ever seen. And guess what... Their like that because they know that if they are bad, then they are gonna get a spanking. My sister doesn't just go crazy beating them though, she takes them into the other room, talks to them, and then spanks them. And it works! lol. Their not emotional messed up or anything. They are very well behaved. So, what are your opinions? Do you think spanking is ok? Why or why not?

She found out that she has an eye disease and she is slowly going blind. i think that after all of that she has gone crazy. Just a couple months ago we had a house paid for in OH but she wanted to move to TN. So she made us move there with her. I hate it here she wont let me do anything and she use to not even have food to take care of us and my neighbors had to take care of me. i know its wrong but i cant stand her she is bipolar or schizophrenic or there is something mentally wrong with her. but instead of going into deep detail on how she treats me i was wondering if there is any way i could move away from her without going into foster care. my neighbors have told her that i could live with them but she said no.. they have also witnessed how she is. please give me some answers

20090304152532AA4Girb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i overreacting?opinions?	Ive been dating this new guy for a little while and i really like him a lot,i havent found a guy that i feel this way about in a while. Basically my question is how do you know if a person cares about you beyond physical appearances?? I mean i really like this guy a lot and last night i was talking to him and i said something in a joking way about cutting my hair all off.(I have long hair) He said he would quit talking to me if i did that. and he said he was dead serious. That just really hurt my feelings a whole lot that he said that and its making me question a lot of things. I havent talked to him since last night but i think he knows im a little upset. He's 28 years old and very mature so i just don't understand why he said that it just took me aback, i don't want to be falling for a guy when im nothing more than his arm candy. Im upset about this but i don't know what to say to him. do you think im overreacting? thoughts or opinions on this??

20090304152904AA9oUV5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHY ARE SO MANY GIRLS ATTRACTED TO MY FRIEND? I DON'T GET IT?	We're in high school in New York. My friend, so many girls are his friends and flirt sorta. They're hot girls. He's about 5'7 to start off, skinny, weak, no abs or six pack or anything like that. He has pretty long hair, maybe down to his shoulders, but more styled and not bad. He smokes cigarettes sometimes, (so do I :P), and he smokes weed sometimes. He listens to death metal and skateboards. He wears tight fitting pants, often colored. He is funny sorta I guess, but when I'm around him I'm usually the one making the jokes and laughs. His old girlfriend, who he had sex with many times, was beautiful. I may seem jealous, I have a girlfriend though. I'm just wondering. He's not ugly though. His personality is relaxed. he's not a badass, he doesn't get in fights, etcetera

Hi, well basically, i (male) really like my close friend (girl), but i dont know if i should ask her out or not cos i dont want to ruin our friendship.   I have always got on really well with her, and in 2 and a half years we have never argued once.

20090304153311AAO7iTQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to remind someone that they need to pay me back in a very nice way?	I've a family friend who called me 2 months back asking me about my books. I had told him then that I had put my books on ebay, but if he wants it then I can just give it to him. So, he came home 2 months back, and said that since I was gonna sell it, he'll just take all the books from me. He took all the books then, and it has been 2 months, he has not called me back to give me my money.    Now, I've a big family and my parents are in very good terms with everyone in his family, so there is no way I can go to him and be like - hey, you need to give me the money. So, can ya'll please suggest a good way in which I can convey my message that he needs to pay me without mentioning the words that "its been 2 months, you haven't given me the money" The situation is very subtle, I dont want him to feel bad at all (coz of the family issues) and I dont want to directly ask him for the money, but I still want to tell him to give me my money.

My dad takes pleasure in getting me in trouble (he tells me so) and as a result, so does my sister.       In fact, my mother just had an angry fit towards me, making me eat alone- separated from the family and taking my cell phone.        She says she is coming back in 10 minutes to take my computer, what should I do to prevent it and deal with them??      Oh, and the fact that my dad is smirking and gloating about me being punished.

I can't kiss him anytime soon, cause he goes to a diff school then me. (I haven't even had my first kiss yet!)            He has almost kissed me before, but people came over and made him not kiss me. Do you think the next time I can be alone with him it'll happen?       Is it natural to have the biggest urge to kiss your crush? especially since you have liked him for two years?)

20090304153808AAC9AkD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	****GUYS ONLY*********?	Okay so I'm 13 and this guy likes me (well I'm not sure anymore..) and he is 14. So things were kind of akward between us. But before I even knew that he liked me, he started asking for my facebook, msn, phone number, etc and if he couldn't get it he would ask his friends. Not so long ago (a week ago) I found out he liked me, through his friend. I didn't mind it, really. And since he found out that I knew that he likes me he is acting different and basically running away if I look at him, lol. He does stupid/silly stuff infront of me ... and kind of talks diffently towards me now. His friend told me that he is shy and would like to go out with me, I said no because I'm not ready to be in a relationship. He always smiles when we look at each other and stares at me for the longest time when I'm not looking (I caught him doing that many times.) Okay so this is what happened (on msn)      Him - hey can I talk to you about something?   Me - yeah ...   Him - Someone told you that I like you: I don't    Me - Okay   Me - good   Him - yeah ... okay   Him - anyways, so everything's good?   Me - I guess so   Him - kool   Him - how did you find out?   Me - what?   Him - Nevermind   Me - you mean how did I find out you liked me?   Him - kind of? ...   Me - Jonel    Him - well, then he's lying   Me - okay lol   Him - lol   Him - what's up         [That's all the information I'm giving you guys]   I know that his friend isn't lying because Jonel and I are REALLY close ............. so yeah.   Jonel also told me that he even told him that he likes me.    Do you think he's lying to not let things to be akward? Or do I have to just accept he doesn't like me and is telling the truth?      **** I know this is in the wrong Category! ****       Sorry. =(

20090304154451AAmuu5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I listen to my friends?	Well my crush Dan was recently told by our friend Elliot that I had a crush on him (lol even though I told Elliot never to tell anyone). And he definitely likes me back. We are flirting like pretty much everyday and well.... It's kind of hard to describe but we both like each other. According to Elliot, "he likes you. A lot. But he doesn't want to ask you out because he's not sure if you like him as much as he likes you". Elliot also told me that he told Dan to play hard to get. But anyways my friends seem to think that it's a good idea to just ask him out. Or at the very least have Elliot do it for me. I honestly think it's a dumb idea though.
20090304154341AAxsL2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused? (Jerks V.S. Nice Guys)?	I was talking with an acquaintance of mine that I hadn't seen in awhile. During the conversation, I mentioned how much of an *** I used to be to one of my other friends. She started laughing and said, "You're so mean.". I was like, "He deserved it. Things are better now between the two of us- He's my minion now. I can't let him surpass my power.". She continued giggling and jokingly told me how much of an *** I was. She seemed to be ENJOYING my jerk-like tendencies. Answer this- Why was she enjoying my jerk-like tendencies? Don't tell me she wasn't. I know she was.      P.S.- Because she happened to be working (at the drug store), I seized the oppurtunity to mess with her when she jumped behind the counter to ring up customers- I grabbed an energy drink, which was the reason I was in the store in the first place, walked up to the checkout stand, she rang it up, I handed her a $20 bill, and as she was breaking the $20, I said, "I had a $5 bill in my wallet, but I gave you a $20 'cause I'm an ***. Thanks for breaking it for me though.". She laughed at THAT too.      So, what was I doing right?
20090304154227AAXjgLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has anyone ever met their new, m.d. and found themselves wanting to invite him somewhere?	How silly am I being... I just wonder if others have been in this situation and what they did to solve their 'dilemma'.   I did find him looking at my jewellery, rings... And his stare when he told me to come back.  I could have fallen off my chair.     He's single, new to the small town and busy, no kids either.   Maybe this will just pass if I hear others who had similar experiences.  So far, I can hardly wait to go back as scheduled in 2 weeks.

20090304153816AA93klL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friend advice..Guys please answer, ladies are welcome as well?	I have a friend who hasn't dated in a while. She's a good person who has just gone through a little drama with a past relationship.  However she went out 2 weeks ago alone and met this hot guy. He told her he had been single for 7mths and he has 2 children. He works in law enforcement. She has none and has a good job as well. They went out one day last week and ended up spending the entire weekend together. She believes it is just a fling. He has been texting her and asking to see her some more. She revealed to me that they were intimate the other day. He wants to see her a lot but he says he doesn't want to seem like he's smoothering her. She's not sure that this will be anything more than a fling so she hasn't asked to see him much. She just goes with the flow. I think she is being very guarded due to her past. Although they were intimate kind of soon do you think that he may be into her more than sexually or do you think it's a fling for him as well. Please only helpful advice. Best answer rewarded

20090304154323AAgckRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I make of this situation?	I've had a massive crush on this guy for about a month and also about a year and a half ago when we first met. He is really sweet and we like all the same things and he seems really down to earth, not all cocky like all the other boys.      But recently, he brought up the subject of my past love life. And i was like, "WTF? I really don't have much of a past love life..." but we got talking, and we shared out stories. First he told me about all of his girlfriends (Which was a surprising amount...). The last one he talked about happened a year ago, and he went on about how great she is. The story went something like this...      They met for the first time in the caf when they made eye contact. Apparently, he was really intrigued by her and thought she was pretty. But they never made conversation until later, about a month or two later, and then they got talking and stuff and went out. Apparently it was "destiny" since they were both already friends with each other on this game before they met in real life. And they broke up because of a fight he had with the other guys who liked her. Their still friends, but he seems really hung up on her. I'm just thinking... would it be possible for him to get over her? I think he still might have feeling for her... He said that with their relationship also dies romance at high school, but he told me he had said that before, but didn't hold that vow.      GRRR!!!! I really like him but I'm worried I have no chance. Help me?
20090304154339AAm1dLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i go out with him?	this boy just came to the school today, but he's not new. he was at the school for seven years and was taken out of school for this year and he just came back. we know each other and all from church and stuff. well every one in the school is betting that we will go out by the end of the week. even my friend's little sister is betting that i will, and she's in preschool!!! i really like him and he told me that he likes me a lot. but i am torn between two choices. should i stand up to the school and wait out the week then go out with him, to prove something to everyone? or should i go out with him when he asks me tomorrow?      by the way:   he has red hair that hangs down over his eyes   lots of freckles   hazel eyes   overall looks very scottish/irish         if that helps, by the way, do you also think i have good taste, or not?
20090304154245AAURulk	Family & Relationships;Family	My sisters being doing weed everyday, what  should I do?	Ohkay, so, my fourteen year old sister, started smoking about four monthes ago.  She doesn't do it too often, but her smoking, made her some new friends, that really aren't a good influence (druggies and alcoholics) We live in the ghetto of our school district pretty much, so that obviously sets a bad environment, but she was doing so good until' now.      Now she does weed, about a month or two ago, she tried it for the first time, only did it every other week, now she does it every day.  And shes starting to deal a little bit.      If that weren't enough, she wants to start doing heroine or cocaine.  Something like that.      All of this, depresses me.  We used to be oh so close, to the point where we would do everything together, hang out after school, hang out in school, on the weekends, we were always together.  But, i'm a goody two shoes, and she knows it, so when she started this, things got tense, so now we just don't talk, because we always end up fighting.      I really miss my old sister, not necessarily a goody two shoes like me, but shes become a total ***** now.  To everyone, and now she's starting to get guys like crazy cause she acts like sucha whore.      I've talked to quite a few of my friends about this, half of them say I shouldn't tell my parents, and that i'm making a big deal out of nothing, that this is high school, and it's bound to happen.  The other half say I should tell my parents.      So what should I do? Should I tell my parents?   And please don't say talk to my sister about it, i've tried.

20090304153655AAB7TC8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend is not a virgin..?	my boyfriend (17) of almost 4 months is not a virgin. As a matter of fact he lost his virginity at around 12 years old -_-. hmm. he's been with a lot of girls (in MY opinion) but not enough to be a player or anything. he's even taken at least 4 different girls virginities. i LOVE my boyfriend and he treats me amazingly. we are very sexually attracted to each other. i would LOVE to lose my virginity to him ONE DAY, but i do not want to end up being just one of those girls whose virginities he took.  i'm fifteen years old btw. i'm just scared of all the consequences of me possibly losing my virginity to him ESPECIALLY pregnancy or my mom finding out, because i know i can NEVER tell her anything under those terms because she'll immediately judge me. i know that i'm not ready to have sex but i am just so attracted to him and everytime we're together we can't help ourselves. i just need advice. =X

20090304153807AAiPsUk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like these two guys....?	One of them seems to like me too (he's alot more forward.) The other one is really shy, but alot of people say he likes me too. The thing is.....the one that is really forward isn't attractive at all. I know that seems really shallow of me, and I'm not normally like that.   The other one isn't attractive either, but he's better looking then the other one. I really like both of them and I think one of them will ask me out soon, but I don't know who to say yes to. (I know this sounds really juvenile (I'm 14) but I really need you to answer!) And I want to know from a girls perspective if you would choose the unattractive, funny, sweet guy (he seems like he would be a good bf) or the cute, shy guy (it seems like I would have to initiate everything)   Thanks for all your answers!! :)
20090304153915AAGeYpC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend help.  Wanting to make some changes.  Advice?	I would like to get out there and start meeting people.  I’m 20.  I’ve also already finished college.  I haven’t had a girlfriend before, except for when I was around 10 or so if you consider that a girlfriend then, and I want to make some changes.  I have made three attempts to ask girls out, and all three times I was turned down, but they were from back in high school.  I don’t want to sit around and complain about it anymore – I need to get out there.  What kind of places does a guy go to meet someone?  I am a unique, honest, compassionate, helpful, loving, and kind-hearted person, and I have a crazy sense of humor, but I am shy and I take some things personally.  I normally can be pretty talkative once I get comfortable in an environment, at least I do now – it’s just the initial fear of going to a new environment that kind of holds me back.  Is there any way to overcome that?      I wasn't that confident about myself, but I’m getting better because I’ve been working hard on losing weight.  I’ve lost 35 pounds since September (and 45 pounds since the “before” picture below).      Now I’m proud of what I’ve done with my lifestyle changes, but I know I still have some pounds to lose, and I’m going to keep going!  I know I have some other things to overcome and work on also.  Where do I start?  ?      Here’s a pic of me:    http://img13.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...       So any advice?  Thanks!  :)

20090304154211AAzqM2w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend and i have a new baby together so im trying to be more accepting....?	my boyfriend and i have been together for almost 2 years. we have a 3 month old baby together so im trying to be more understanding of him.... he is a very gullable person and takes the advice of others very seriously. he comes from a well ta do family and has been treated like a baby all his life. him and his older sister are very close and he holds her opinions very high and she thinks that his behavior is just so cute and egs it on... he doesnt seem to have his own opinion about anything and consults everyone but me for advice. he is more interested in what im wearing than what i have to say. now being a mother my priorities have changed and am tired of being constantly criticized over my decisions. he wants to take our 3month old to a chiropracter to get "adjusted" because his friends have done it to their children... i wont allow this and find it scary to say the least... this is only a small portion of our problems but hopefully someone can help. how do i get him to realize that he is allowed to think for himself and not be so into everyone elses opinion? its tearing us apart and is making me resent him
20090304154223AAralR9	Family & Relationships;Friends	GUYS AND GIRLS: HOW DO I FLIRT WITH HIM!?!?

20090304154257AAUzNrX	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this really fair........?	My brother is 8 years old and has been begging  for a bass guitar and guitar lessons.    well, im 16 and i dont ask for much at all other than a new phone because ive had the same phone since i was in 6th grade.       my brother has been sick and not been going to school for a full 1 week and still hasnt gone to school yet. Well, when i got home today he came up to me and explains that he DID get a bass guitar with all the acessories (case, stand etc.) and lessons starting today! All of it was about $600.    And all this time he 'claims' he was sick.   i want to support my brother considering hes so young but at the same time i want to be mad because i was the one that is working my *** off struggling with school, family, and friends and i dont really get rewarded for anything.       Isnt this unfair?    or am i just overreacting?

This is basically how the conversation went : Me: Hey, are you going to the dance? Him: I don't even know. Me: Well is it cause you don't want to or because you don't have a date....? Him: Well I never really go to school dances, and I've been doing Dance outside of school forever so....idonno... Me: Well the school dances are fun and your friends are there you know? You should go, it'll be fun. Him: idonno Me: Well you wanna go with me? Him: *smiles* Me: Yeah? Him: Well when is it? Me: Next friday Him: Wow. Already? Me: Yeah, you don't have to go if you don't want to.... Him: Idonno, I might still wanna go. Me: Okay, tell me if you do k? Him: *nodding and smiling*okay. And then I leave. So do you think he wants to go with me but isn't sure yet about if  he can? Or does he just not want to go with me? And I have to let him bring it up again right?
