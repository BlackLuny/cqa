I was told then by apple to take it back to the place i bought it which i did told them the story and they phoned apple in the shop themselves, and was told the same thing that they tried for 2 hours and that it was not reparable. I asked for my money back but they refused they said they would have to have it in righting from apple and send it away.      Away it went back to apple and low and behold it camewithin the week as a  replacement but we would not get another 12 month guarantee for this, so i then asked for my money back and never got it and after 1 hour in the comet store watching people returning faulty goods I got no where.   I asked why not and i don't think any one in this store could tell me.

I've started a new job, and since I've learned I could be fired for using the internet for ANYTHING not business related, I've decided I will not take a chance even one time by accessing my home email from work.      However, once in a while I think I will need to check or use my personal email.  Wondering... can I do that with my phone?  I get good reception from my office.  I don't use the internet now with the phone because of the cost, but I can, and would likely just buy a plan.  Does anyone know if I could access yahoo/gmail/hotmail using my Fusic?  I really don't want to buy a new phone as well. :-)

So, do I have to get ALL the bobblehead on the one save or can I do it over 2.   I.E. can I get the first 19 on my current save and just go back and get that 1 on the other save, or will I have to go back to my Raven Rock save and get ALL the other ones again in that save.      I hope that makes sense.

20090131142651AAZCc8H	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Sony KDL 42v4100 or Samsung ln40a550?	At the same price which would you buy? This TV is for the bedroom so I do not need any larger than a 40-42".      I would go with the Sony at a larger size but am worried about the lower contrast ratio (25,000:1 vs 30,000:1) and higher Pixel Response Time (8ms vs 5ms) of the Sony.  These specs make the Samsung seem like it would provide a better picture, making it worth the 2" sacrifice.        One other thing to consider, the Sony has a matte finish while the Samsung has a glossy finish making the Sony less susceptible to glare.      Both seem like great TV's, which would you buy?  I would appreciate feedback from anyone who has owned one of these TV's.  Thanks.
