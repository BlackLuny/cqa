20090223112627AAhbCtK	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	A little help with a math problem.?	OK Three people rented a cabin for $500 and $250 security deposit. Originally there were four people so everyone paid $115 but one person dropped out and didn't pay at all. So the first person paid $115 with no part of the security deposit. The second person paid $265($115 and $150 towards the security deposit) and the third paid $270 ( $115, $100 towards security deposit and $55 for the remainder)      Now having said that, how do you split up the money when the security deposit is returned and has everyone paid there fair share?

Polyploidy rarely occurs in mammals,and when it does it has deathly effects  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploidy  save for one rat.      Genetic duplication usually occurs in plants,but when it occurs in humans it creates an instability in the genome of and contributes to diseases like autism and schizophrenia.      These two things that are crucial to evolution seem to be hindering it.

You would normally fill in the s subshell first, but you can't have a valence electron be in the d subshell, so you end up having some unpaired electrons in the d subshell. Would that count towards your total number of unpaired electrons?

My mom called the Dr. and they're changing the prescription so that I just have 25mg pills. My mom told me to stop taking the half-pills and to wait for the new ones. So I missed my dosage today...what's gonna happen now?      Also, I'm a college student and even though I was instructed to take them every morning, since I have morning classes and didn't know how I'd react to the drug, I found myself taking them around 1:00 everyday. My mom told me that I must take them in the morning cuz that's what the bottle says. >_<       Basically...my question is... #1 what happens if you missed a dosage and you just started, #2, do I have to take them in the morning?

20090223132546AA72VG6	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics help power of windmill?	1. The power P delivered by a windmill whose blades sweep in a circle of diameter D by a wind of speed v is proportional to the square of the diameter and the cube of the wind speed. This dependence on diameter and wind speed is expected in the case of 100%-efficient energy transfer from the wind to the mill. Show that for 100%-efficient energy transfer the power of the windmill is given by P=(pi/8)*ρ*D^2v^3 .   (Hint: First calculate the kinetic energy of a cylinder of air of density ρ moving with speed v, then determine the rate at which this energy is transferred to the windmill.)

20090223140932AABM0R7	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Should I give up trying to be an engineer?	I've been looking for me an engineering job for the past five years since I graduated with my Master's in Aerospace Engineering.  Since then, I have not be able to find work in my field.  I have spent more time teaching school than I have doing anything engineering related, and it's very frustrating.  After five years of looking, I'm seriously considering saying the 'hell with this s***' and just give up.  It's been five years of fruitless searching.  In fact, the more time passes, the less likely they'll hire me in some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy of not hiring someone because of their lack of experience when worsens over time when they reject my resume off hand just because I haven't work as an aerospace engineer in the years since I left college.  My question is, have I passes that point of no return and all I'm doing is wasting my time and I should just accept that I never be an engineer?

Is there a single hurricane or tornadoe that rotated clockwise? i have failed to find a single snail shell that was designed clockwise! I notice that all planets in our solar system including earth itself follow same pattern as in Tawaf of Kaba in Muslim Hajj as shown on tv, it resembles more a view of each galaxial rotation image from Nasa in space or sattelite images of each Hurricane in motion and recorded movies of twisters too,  all seem to be following only A1law of rotation in one and same direction! The theoretical law applies that when a ball is spinned into air with a right hand, regardless of helding of ball from top or bottom, it is in human nature that the ball will either way rotated with right hand will result such if it was earth the ball that the sun would rise in east, where spin made on balls with left hand show clockwise rotation, if such were the event the sun be rising from west. I like to add further , to get better answer on my querry, that i have experimented using a ball and a flash light. i found out that north pole view is always contrary to south pole view when it comes to rotation being clockwise or not, but as for known fact so far, the images we see of glalxies rotating clockwise are infact showing southern pole view! so lets see if we have a new discovery on universal Law being reffered to a supreme being comparing A1law to A1lah, as we would compare Earth to Ardh!
