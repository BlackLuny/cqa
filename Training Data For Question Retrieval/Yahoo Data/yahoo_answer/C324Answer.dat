ms2H2UZIaa	I'm really not sure. We don't know of too many people who were actually born on the island. Charlotte was, Miles has been there before but he is Asian. A male born in the late 70's on the island... My guess is that we haven't really met this character yet. He may not even turn out to be important, you know how the writers like to drop things in to distract us. It can't be Ben because we know he was born off the island and his mother died in childbirth.|`|l0rutewhaa	I have no theory on this at all. They would have to be pretty youngish at the time of the crash, as she gave birth in 1977, making the boy 27 years old when 815 crashes.<br>  Ethan?<br>  What I wanna know is what has happened to Claire. She was last seen in the cabin with Christian at the end of season 4 and hasn't been seen since. Emilie de Ravin who plays Claire has taken a year out but will return in season 6. But how will they write her back in?<br>  I'm glad Locke is alive!|`|EJo9s75Aaa	Clair's baby is Arron. Amy's baby is Jacob I think.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Ben I expect.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	I think Amy and her baby joined Ben's side before the Purge so they survived. I think it's Ethan. I also think Amy is that women that was in the Others' book club, her name was/is Amelia, so it's possible. Must be weird for her, talking to Juliet like she's never met her before in DHARMA days..<br>  <br>  EDIT: They not bringing him back, Charlotte and Ben were there around the same time too, it's just another way to tie everyone together.|`|AA10954273	We know it's not Ben because we saw him be born in Seattle.  It could be Ethan.  It could also be someone we haven't met yet.

gmVX2nZnaa	Okay. Thanks for pointing that out.<br>  Now leave.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	I believe in astrology but not horoscopes. Horoscopes are just predictions that have become altered and now have a sole purpose to entertain. Horoscopes cannot pertain to every single person born under that sign, so it's likely not going to be true for everyone. Once in a while horoscopes are spot on, but that is just a rarity. Astrology minus horoscopes, is mainly personality analysis due to different planetary influences and movements.|`|dHkvVlONaa	I believe lol.<br>  <br>  Like, a couple years ago I read my summer horoscope and it said don't fall for the guy I meet on a summer holiday.  Well that summer I met this guy on Independence day and let's just say things 'didn't work out' lol.  <br>  <br>  And then so this past summer I also met a guy really close to Independence day again.  I really started to like him and we made out but he had a girlfriend who was my friend and things just got kinda messy.  <br>  <br>  So either my horoscope really knows the future (and was kind enough to warn me about it) or it was just a coincidence.  Twice.|`|Jg8ngWj0aa	I don't believe in daily horoscopes but I believe in astrology and zodiacs and your personality traits. I believe whatever sign you are, you have specific traits as well as your rising sign and moon sign and mercury sign and N. Nodes etc. I believe if you were born at a certain time a a certain latitude and longitude that you have specific Personality traits. But i don't believe in those daily horoscopes that say "You will find fortune today!' But you never do. I think those are B.S. But You should research your zodiac sign. I'm sure youll be surprised by how accurate it is!|`|94zi1LFFaa	and yet you post here... seems more to me that you don't have all the answers & astrology resonates with you but you struggle with that...<br>  <br>  maybe you should be asking yourself why you have such animosity towards astrology & religions. There is knowledge to be learned from all modalities... The answers are always though right inside your own self.<br>  <br>  ~peace|`|IQZxdghGaa	I stopped believing when it said something about money and love, they never came|`|5caec993eac9c99e4343f9ba6a23999caa	i just do it 4 fun|`|Jl6a1fxzaa	Mrs. O: [reading her horoscope] You have green, scaly skin, and a soft yellow underbelly with a series of fin-like ridges running down your spine and tail. Although lizardlike in shape, you can grow anything up to thirty feet in length with huge teeth that can bite off great rocks and trees. You inhabit arid subtropical zones, and you wear spectacles.<br>  <br>  Mrs. Trepidatious: It's very good about the spectacles.<br>  <br>  Mrs. O: It's amazing!|`|8WajgMlGaa	I can't give you any scientific evidence, but what I can tell you is that I didn't believe in it at one time either.<br>  <br>  I always felt that I was a very difficult person to describe, and one day out of curiosity I decided to research my zodiac sign, and to my shock, it described me to a T! <br>  <br>  I've noticed there are a few exceptions, but when I think of all of the people I know, they seem to fit the description of their sign, and that's not even generally speaking.<br>  <br>  It really enabled me to see why some of my relationships and friendships failed, and why others were perfect.<br>  <br>  I  don't read my horoscopes because I don't buy into any of that, but I really do think there is some substance to astrology.|`|UBkxRrhZaa	Before you get huffy, study a little Deeper. Einstein recognised it as a Science. I see what you are saying but there is more to it than newspaper trash. If I did a precise chart on you, I'd probably make you blush. Anyway, either way, it's ok, I don't mind.|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	There's no proof of concept for any religion at all, but I'm absolutely positive you wouldn't think twice about your precious Bible.<br>  <br>  It's all ridiculous.|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Wow, cool revelation dude.<br>  <br>  Go find something else to do, you deep thinker you.|`|RD4qIv0Eaa	a lot of misfortune, wanting to feel like you have some control over something. its like god for atheists.|`|mNLV4iiJaa	this is a retorical question you wont get an answer|`|AZMEygRvaa	The same reason people believe that there is a Jewish zombie, who's flesh they symbolically eat, whose blood they symbolically drink, then spoken to telepathically, to ask forgiveness for sins as a result of a ribbed women, eating a magic apple, in an enchanted garden, as told by a talking snake.<br>  <br>  Human nature is to make some **** up if we can't explain things for ourselves.  Some people believe that everything is pre-determined and that there is no free will.  <br>  <br>  Whatever floats your boat and makes you happy.  Some people enjoy horoscopes and find them entertaining.  If you don't like them.  Don't read them.|`|IG44JIzuaa	i don't believe all the horoscopes .. but there are some sites that often tell truth .. like in the end of the day i come back and see the horoscope .. and often it's true .. that's why i believe :)<br>  but yeah, when i think abt it .. how can the horoscope fit all those ppl .. damn, but i still keep on believin it .. simply can't help :)<br>  <br>  yeah, i hate religions too<br>  <br>  som1 said (s)he is doin it for fun ? mhm .. how do you find it fun ? :/|`|uIBGtINAaa	Did you come here to vent your opinions? -.- go away<br>  anyways, there are some things in the world that simply are unable to be explained by science BELIEVE THAT!|`|qnU1HS1aaa	FINALLY .. someone that doesn't believe in horoscopes!<br>  <br>  *bows down to you*
AA11417199	Aquarius go swim in the lake or ocean or something....go clear your chaotic mentality. Maybe you can take a bucket and fill it up with some salt-water. Then pour it out!lol<br>  -Sagittarius|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	There is no way that Aquarians are heartless, they are the biggest humanitarians of the zodiac, the are all about helping people in a big way.<br>  I find it might be true that they can be rude, or a little blunt.<br>  I have many close friends that are Aquarians and they are awesome and caring they are always willing to listen to me, and at least make a joke to make me feel better|`|FhKfyxWlaa	One thing Aquarius IS NOT:  Stupid. And, I can honestly say that when most people are complaining about Aquarius people it is because they don't understand that part of their nature that makes them just not give a damn---or at least appear that way.|`|OegheALwaa	i didn't even read your whole question, because i love Aquarius :D<br>  <br>  im a pisces|`|9UCvu7RYaa	I can only speak for myself, but I have given people   my last dollar before, but if you cross me then you've made an enemy for life.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I respect the Aquarius personality. They speak their minds and they are usually right too about the human race. I had an Aquarius guy in my english class and he would annoy everyone ( but me ) because he would speak his mind about our society. They speak truths that are dared not said. <br>  <br>  You are absolutely right<br>  If someone judges you first, you judge back.|`|to6JW3yFaa	Aquas dont ever really attempt to seem mean or rude. They're reallllly friendly in nature, it's just that they're also really blunt about their opinions instead of trying to sugar coat it. They may not realize that they've hurt another person because of their bluntness because they themselves dont think it's really rude since their intentions are to make their point and not hurt anyone.<br>  <br>  Aquas are also not heartless... at all. They just hold in all of their feelings and emotions so they dont let it take overthemselves and their logic.... like it normally does for us water signs haha. They also find it very difficult to open up to other people, but that's probably mainly cause they dont want to get hurt or to let other people in who they believe they cant trust. But they do show that other side of themselves once they become more comfortably. At least I think so, from experience.

XQEBIkkhaa	I would suggest a Jupiter intermediate model flute. The Jupiter brand has keys that are very light to the touch; you will be able to play fast music without a hitch. The sound is also very great. They are very reasonable in prices. Here is one from Fluteworld.<br>  <a href="http://fluteworld.com/index.php?action=prod&wart=14228&ppk=flut" rel="nofollow">http://fluteworld.com/index.php?action=p...</a><br>  <br>  You should also check out Gemeinhardt intermediate models. Gemeinhardt is a very dependable brand of very good quality. Also, at a decent price.<br>  <a href="http://fluteworld.com/index.php?action=prod&wart=48426&ppk=flut" rel="nofollow">http://fluteworld.com/index.php?action=p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Both of these currently cost only around 600$. Plus, Fluteworld will let you try a flute for ten days before you decide to buy it. Good luck!

It feels much better.<br>  <br>  Being loose can signify frequent sexual activity, and when you're not having lots of sex with one person, it can be quite a turn off.<br>  <br>  However some women are naturally not-so-tight,  so it's not that big a deal.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about being too loose, try doing kegal exercises.|`|oi6eHkPzaa	Loose morals + tight coochie = P-A-R-T-Y time.

94zi1LFFaa	that's easy to answer... don't try so hard... Just be yourself... & above all else be honest. Honest about how you feel about something/anything... Don't bend just because you think it will make her happy.  Cancerians smell weakness a mile away & see right through people. They also sometimes play with people if they know the other person likes them... Time is totally relative to cancerians... 7 months a year 2 years... or how ever long... If you pull back a touch but continue to give the same caring energy I'm willing to bet she'll let you in... She cares about you too or she wouldn't still be around you... Quit giving off the energy that you guys are in any "phase" and just live your life & be a good friend to her. Oh & stop worrying... Worrying gives off an energy that makes others turn away especially water signs who are so sensitive to energy. I might even suggest renting the movie "The Secret" to help with this & other things in your life that you want to improve.<br>  <br>  ~Peace|`|FhKfyxWlaa	7 months is a while. With my two close Virgo friends, we hit it off and opened up immediately.  You may be afraid to reveal your inner self to her...my guess is that you've been burned before. Virgo is pretty frank and  blunt...what you see is what you get.  I think you may be hiding. Try getting more personal about yourself, and opening up. Don't be insecure that you'll scare her away. Obviously she likes you enough to be friends with you if she has hung around you this long.  We're all afraid of getting hurt, but we can't treat everyone in our lives as if they're eventually going to burn us. Virgos are loyal, and the best friends of the zodiac in my opinion. Open up, crabby!  :)  Have some self confidence!|`|ynUYRPFuaa	IM A CANCER:)<br>  Do not pay attention to that<br>  Cancers are meant to be caring and stuff u will not scare away but she may become close to you|`|PIjCNYQNaa	You've been doing well. Make sure that you don't seem too dominating; that could scare the poor girl. Cancers usually are pretty outgoing. I think you two just haven't had a bonding experience yet. Something that would be an inside joke for the two of you. That'll make the friendship grow.<br>  <br>  On another note, since you are born closer to Libra and she is born closer to Gemini, you may want to use your common Air aspect to form a bond, although Libras (order) and Geminis (spontaneity) sometimes clash.

Then buy yourself a decent brand, used - a Yamaha, Jupiter, Emerson, etc.  The Lindo you got will break in less than a month, and then be unfixable - no spare parts, and the metal so soft and brittle that bent keys will SNAP when a tech tries to fix them - IF IF IF you get a teach to even TAKE this into their shop - many will not.

Definitely recommended! :D<br>  <br>  Fuyu no Semi - Oh my gosh! This is one of the best yaoi anime ever! I was totally captivated by it. Beautiful characters, wonderful plot and so addictive!

vhQXAuB7aa	I dont believe they should be token to court but it does get me mad when that happens. You go through all the trouble of buying the ticket, driving there, bragging to everyone about it...then they lip sing. I believe if there going to lip they at least need a good excuse or make everything half price at least. Its a true rip off and gets me kinda pissed off. But should they be taken to court...Depends how much you like them. i would never want one of my fav rock starts to go to court, be they should stop lip singing.|`|hepo1ICcaa	no. just boycott with your money and don't buy their music anymore<br>  <br>  that is pretty lame when they lip sync. touring and concerts were a way for them to justify their high income; at least they were sort of working hard for it. but then trash like britney spears just does some lip syncing coupled with gyrating and thinks that is ok. i dont understand why more fans dont become angry and boycott her. she thinks a few hours in the studio and she is set, living off of her name rather than actually working for it.

I've heard that vocalizing with your body submerged in the water (like in the beach or swimming pool) is quite good.<br>  Drinking ginger in warm water could also help.<br>  Never drink cold water or drinks after vocalizing or singing|`|d379FoMOaa	To dwell on Cecilia's point. Dairy, coffee, caffeinated tea(herbal teas are far better for your voice) sweets, or anything with excessive sugar is bad for your vocal cords. Even soda, who wants to sing a solo, then have a sudden urge to burp?<br>  Also, there are ways you can sing high notes, by expanding your vocal range, but if you are an alto, don't try singing soprano. <br>  You can warm up your voice by doing sirens. a vocal siren is basically going up and down with your voice. But one thing I notice that some girls in the choir do when they do vocal sirens, they tend to scream their upper notes, and then when they get to the low notes, they overuse the vocal fry. This can damage a voice. Anyway, a scale doing biddy biddy bop bop can help. Just sing a normal scale, but don't scream the upper notes.|`|f2eJinNVaa	Well i take voice lessons and i'v learned that before you sing in front of an audience or anything do some scales but do not sing too loud or too high of notes or you will strain your voice. Second, Don't have any dairy products like milk, yogert, ice cream or cheese b cuz it will clog up your throght and you will not sing good.|`|HULRxii5aa	To warm up your voice try doing simple scales up and down with your voice (eg doh ray me fah soh la ti doh) and use different sounds, like doing the scale to aah, ee, oh, oo and starting at different notes. Each day go a litle higher and eventually your voice will get used to singing higher notes.

gDN3UyIJaa	I wouldn't say that Menuhin was better when he was younger. Most performers are more technical when they were young, and become more interpretation-oriented when they get older. Menuhin did have a bit of a slump but he came out of it. As for his sound... well, he's one of those who doesn't use a Strad, you know? His violin is the normal kind you can buy without having to sell your house and last pair of good pants to afford. <br>  <br>  One prominent performer whose skills has declined noticeably for me is Daniel Barenboim as a pianist. He's been more active as a conductor in recent years and the lack of practice time on the piano is showing. He even got booed in Milan recently for making a lot of sloppy mistakes during a concert. As a conductor, he's one of the best, though.<br>  <br>  And there's always the case of David Helfgott, the pianist whose life was depicted in the film 'Shine'. A brilliant interpreter of Rachmaninov, and then he had a mental breakdown and never been the same since. :o(<br>  <br>  All the same, most performers have down phrases in their performance career. It's something to be expected (they are human after all)... and its cause can vary. I'd rather appreciate the great performances they treat us to when things are going good, and root for them when they're struggling.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Casals and Segovia seemed to get better with age; Artists without a rock-solid technique will generally find their flaws increasingly exposed with age.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	I think that many of Bell's earlier recordings are very good, although some of his more recent ones sound just terrible.|`|qswrz268aa	Perhaps some will disagree, but Gilels, the pianist, became harsh, inaccurate, sloppy, and violent with age... Not at all my favorite pianist with his elderly recordings...<br>  <br>  I'm afraid I'm not as knowledgeable of violinists, so I can't judge Menuhim correctly...|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	For me, Yehudi Menuhin was totally overrated after the age of about 18. He was a great young violinist but never realised his potential. By the age of about 50 his playing was inaccurate and unfocussed.|`|odITpObGaa	I always think of Jacqueline DuPre.   She acquired MS and declined rather rapidly.|`|NJaZBgDwaa	Maria Callas.<br>  <br>  (although I never liked her voice... it sounded like a sheep, then it got that wobble...)

She should of left him when he first put his hands on her. And for the people who say she deserves need to stop. No woman ever deserves to be beaten and completely disrespected like that. Ever. Its just a huge disappointment from her. It is not ok for a man to ever lay his hands on a woman. I believe that brown should serve time. It makes me sick that these celebs get out for and act like nothing happened. Its a crooked system. I completely disagree with her. Brown was wrong for what he did and she is wrong for taking him back. I thought of her as a victim at first and felt bad for her. Now i just pity them both. They are both now bad examples to the youth looking up to them. I never really listen to brown or Rhianna so I'm looking at this from the outside so i am taking neither side.

Final Fantasy: Spirits Within has nothing to do with Advent Children or the Final Fantasy VII world. Plus, in my opinion, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a horrible film. It was really nice looking but it made little sense and was boring. <br>  <br>  If you haven't played Final Fantasy VII for the PSX, some parts might not make sense though since Advent Children takes place a little after FFVII (PSX). But definitely watch the movie. The fight scenes are especially a strong aspect of Advent Children.
p7UcyGYFaa	I'm interested to hear the "half value" answers mentioned above; that's new to me, but it makes sense.<br>  <br>  A teacher I had suggested that you might think of Baroque staccatos as being "sticky,"  rather like pop had dripped onto the keys and kept you from releasing the note as quickly as you want. It doesn't have the mathematical precision of the other idea, but seems to work well for students first learning to play Baroque style.<br>  <br>  And as always, you'll want to think of staccatos as being releases, not attacks. Lift your fingers off the keys; don't try to play them more quickly - that will tend to cause unwanted accenting and encourage rushing.|`|19YfKNpJaa	I haven't heard the "1/2 the value of the notated note" rule either (except when given to very young musicians who ask good questions like this).  But I'd be hard-pressed to say that there's any rule that tells us how short.<br>  <br>  I can tell you this -- a Bach staccato is not as short as a Stravinsky staccato.  Keep in mind that staccato means "detached" or "separated" and NOT "short."  There is a difference...you can play notes in a detached style without them being particularly short.  <br>  <br>  Good news:  if you're asking questions like this (and presumably you also wonder "how short is staccato in piano music from the romantic era?" etc), then you're showing characteristics of being an intelligent musician.  What this means is that you should seek out private lessons immediately with a professional who can help you find the answers you want.  Go to it!  Good luck!|`|10mOHSZTaa	Well, I don't know which bouree you're talking about (Bach wrote well over a thousand pieces and 'bouree' is just a kind of piece) and the piano was not around in the Baroque. Even Beethoven played on pianofortes (today we have more powerful fortepianos) which were just starting to be fiddled with at the end of Bach's life. Ideally you'd be playing this on a real harpsichord -for the love of all that is holy, not the harpsichord sound on your keyboard- but such is life.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, as far as I know, staccato is always played the same way: you release the weight from the key as soon as you play it. Everyone has some individual variations in their technique; for example, I play a very, very short staccato- each note is heard, but I don't stay there a milisecond longer than I have to. Other people might prefer a broader sound.<br>  <br>  However your staccato ends up, try thinking of it as being like a flash of lightning: it's there, it's powerful, and then it's gone. Powerful doesn't mean loud, but it does mean that you don't use staccato as a chance to skip over notes. Generally speaking, staccato notes provide a degree of extreme clarity to a piece and highlight each individual note- of course, a composer could use staccato for other reasons, but that's one of them.<br>  <br>  All the notes you see on the score are there for a reason, so don't forget to play all of them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And what tesla said.|`|EHVTw8hEaa	if you want to be that specific... bach did use the piano... he preferred the harpsichord.. but did write on the piano... also.. the piano's keybord is the same as the harpsichord... in fact, bach and all baarouque music is often played on the piano... in fact, most colleges require applicants to play a bach prelude and fugue....you should know all of this and hence should leave your half thought out comments to yourself...<br>  <br>  as for the actual question..staccato is played as half of the value of the note with a rest in between.. as was already mentioned....|`|AA10125474	Typically, staccato is played at about half the written value of the note.<br>  <br>  F'rinstance, if you had a string of 8th notes marked staccato, you would instead play them as a series of 16th notes with 16th rests in between.<br>  <br>  People, let's try answering questions if we can.  You know, most folks don't have access to a harpsichord, but they still love Bach's music.  Should they be barred from playing it??<br>  Lighten up.<br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  <br>  glinzek|`|64jTtN0jaa	OoOo OoOo pick me pick me Dr. John I know I know!!|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Piano.....Bach.......Baroque<br>  <br>  Which is the odd one out here ?|`|qWNdhGVXaa	very short

ms2H2UZIaa	Jazz is usually defined by its area, Chicago, New York, New Orleans, European. New York jazz mostly took place in Harlem, so the songs reflect that area and lifestyle. Jazz is usually considered to have begun in New Orleans, a dixieland style. By the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency towards calm and smoothness, with the sounds of cool jazz, which favored long, linear melodic lines. It emerged in New York City, as a result of the mixture of the styles of predominantly white jazz musicians and black bebop musicians, and it dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s. Cool jazz recordings by Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Gil Evans, Stan Getz and the Modern Jazz Quartet usually have a "lighter" sound which avoided the aggressive tempos and harmonic abstraction of bebop.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	right now it is where the cream from the other states go. some areas are better at keeping their talent than others, but anyone who really wants to make a name in jazz is going to new york city. new orleans had its moment in the 30s kansas city had its moment in the 40s, chicago in the 60s, but new york has been one of the strongest jazz scenes throughout. people that are national acts that we are happy to have stop in on a tour were i live are just local house bands there. get online and check the village voice site for all the upcoming shows there, if you know your jazz, you will be blown away.|`|5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	Do you mean currently?|`|87f0ad7fe13903495b1962fa8df652efaa	A History of New York Jazz: 1920-1950<br>  <br>  <br>  The term “Jazz” has become a common part of the American vernacular, both as a noun to describe a type of music and as a verb to describe something that is fancy or enhanced beyond the norm, such as a “jazzed up” car or even another piece of music. For all of the free use of the term Jazz, however, very few people have likely given much thought, or taken the time to realize, exactly where the musical genre of Jazz came from, where it blossomed, and who helped it to do so. Controversial from its inception, often reviled in the mainstream press, but loved by a huge number of people of many different races and backgrounds, Jazz has had the power to ironically entertain, inspire, and offend simultaneously. Interestingly enough, however, this musical genre is generally accepted as being a truly American musical style, and from it, many other musical styles have been born, blended, and augmented. All of this can be better appreciated by even the most casual music fan by looking closer at Jazz history and the highlights of it. <br>  <br>  Upon taking a closer look at Jazz history, prominent sources on the topic universally agree that 52nd Street in New York, from the 1920s to the 1950s, was the place and time of the heyday of Jazz (Porter, Reed, Shaw). With this in mind, this paper will take a trip back in time to the Jazz clubs of 52nd Street during that pivotal time, discuss and identify the prominent artists of the time, and also discuss Bebop, a close musical relative of Jazz. Upon conclusion of this research, the reader will have gained a higher understanding/appreciation, for this music.<br>  A “Visit” to 52nd Street, Circa 1920-1950<br>  <br>  In order to fully understand, and appreciate, the circumstances of the Jazz period of 1920-1950 in New York, ultimately coming to rest on 52nd Street, it is necessary to take a trip back in time to that era and learn exactly how/why Jazz came to locate where it did.

AA10040330	Jazz is very free-form anyway and the musicians have to know what they are doing, so they could play without a steady beat behind the music. This type of playing is technically called "rubato". You just play as you feel it without regard to bar lines and beats! "Non-obvious pulse" is a term I've never heard of, but it is self-evident. There is an underlying beat to the music being played, but it is not overtly stated by the musicians. As I said, you have to know what you are doing to play like this."Floating pulse" must mean that the "feel" of the music varies among obvious pulse, no pulse and non-obvious pulse. This type of playing is used a lot, but not solely, in slower passages.

I had one by my ear two days before my birthday that wouldn't pop. It turned into a staph infection/abscess, so ON MY EFFING BIRTHDAY after an appointment that I really didn't want to go to, I was in the emergency room getting my face poked with Novocaine and sliced and drained. Put on anti-biotics that didn't work at first. Back in the emergency room 2 days later, with the same poking and slicing and draining, and then put on more effective anti-biotics. Then back at my general practitioner two days after that to have a follow up poke/slice/drain.<br>  Pimple popping=scary.|`|WsQ2i0Hkaa	I try to refrain..it's just so hard when it feels like it's got it's own heartbeat...

Pvp3FbuBaa	To say the least, I was NOT disappointed. I enjoyed the film as much as I thought I would. Going in, I had some doubts, what with a new director and this being a fifth installment in a horror series (they usually start sucking by the 3rd). <br>  <br>  As soon as the opening credits start, you can already tell that a different director had his hands on the project. Acceptence doesn't take long to sink in though. As expected, the film meets the typical Saw requirements. Multiple traps and more revealing back-story. <br>  <br>  Simply put, Saw V should not disappoint the loyal Saw fan. I know I'll be back for the next installment with bells on.<br>  <br>  Seeing that this is the fifth film, you simply MUST see 1-4 in order to truly understand all the flashbacks. I don't want to give anything away, so all I will say is this: The very last trap in this film is one of my new favorites. . .|`|TbvRLumkaa	If you like the saw movies you will like it...i loved it! i think the newer ones are better..so if you have seen them all it def. ties up the loose ends!<br>  <br>  edit...yes there is a saw 6 coming out late october...im soo excited!! i own 1-5 :o)|`|DnyyyGeEaa	it was good.

They've had very little going for them; the lyrics are dull, the performances are carried out as if the performers can't be bothered and the music is average with nothing of interest.<br>  The UK has got to actually *try* if it wants to get points!|`|cCbKTbzSaa	probably because  they can not sing in  key to  the  tune.<br>  <br>   not only  that they  pick out  rubbish  contestants,  and give them  hope.  i feel for them.  <br>  <br>  if they  cannot  sing , why!   put them on and humiliate them  in front  <br>  of  their  friends  and families. <br>  <br>   that is what i would like to know.  poor  things.  talk about torment.|`|f16135be2aee5d27de11802f8dd54704aa	Usually down to poor songs and poor performers.|`|64R1DrtHaa	no talent, money and we're sh_t.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Because they don't want to host the next one!|`|58UB5lqRaa	I have watched the Eurovision a few times and i have noticed that when it comes to the judging  each country always give higher points to the country closest to them, i dont think it has any thing to do with talent. you will notice that its always the country they are most friendly with who wins.

4e1996e1460dd8c8152c65c5357260a6aa	Possibly, we can often end up thinking irrationally and do something we regret later. Depends on the person for how long, and i guess its because we delete any other info regarding the situation 4rm our heads, and focus on the point that made us angry. I hope most ppl aren't like this, but a lot are...its just a human thing...|`|hQNmgdQ7aa	Well, when I get angry, I would laugh ...for some reason.<br>  <br>  That's why I never get mad, people would think I'm kidding. -.-<br>  But then if I'm really pissed off, I would just bite my lips hard and be quiet for all the day. xPP<br>  <br>  Wish I knew why.|`|BZheNWRjaa	uumm sure.<br>  it makes u want revenge.<br>  <br>  answer mine anyone??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227150504AAifLVB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ZwPpVJgcaa	U said it  ding dong!|`|UdemZ27caa	yes|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yes !

eEoeURDHaa	Nah, even though I like Megadeth better, the "old" fans who argue about the two all the time would want a separate section for Megadeth<br>  <br>  MA Never listened to them, but I need to<br>  MA Arch Enemy<br>  MA I haven't listened to them either, although I've heard good things|`|tOcLHjGzaa	Hmm i think Catch Thirty-Three but Destroy. Erase. Improve. is a close second.|`|RzTb60Ufaa	And a Beatles section? And an Troll section? oh, definitely the Troll section.|`|4EfNaDH5aa	Yes. Yes they should.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Its because we have a bunch of Mainstreamers in this section. I am getting sick of this place all together Gem your not alone. Its like when I go to log on and come on here I start GAGING!!<br>  <br>  MQ: obZen<br>  2 - Arch Enemy but I love both bands<br>  3- The Path I Choose<br>  <br>  But yeah bro I wont be on here much anymore I will probably spend more time in other sections due to the rise of Mainstreamers and Douche Bags.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I just noticed how many there are to-HOLY|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Lol..yeah There has im not shure why(i've participated in all of them i think XD)<br>  But There should be a "Bacon" section as Peaches recomended.<br>  <br>  ObZen.IMO It's there best album to come from them.To intense sometimes.I love it.<br>  <br>  MQ2:Arch enemy,But i like Dark too.<br>  <br>  MQ3:Too hard...This week i like Stand alone.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Yeah, then I could get away from their overratedness. I would be separated by a section. Metallica is good, but isn't worthy of all its praise.<br>  <br>  MA: ?<br>  MA2: Dark Tranquility <br>  MA3: Melancholy (Holy Martyr)|`|12QJ9QMRaa	MWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Would you prefer MCR or the Jonas Bros?<br>  Sorry like hell for being a "Mainstreamer", but I figure if I want to ask some Q's about one of my favorite bands, how is that hurting anyone?  <br>  <br>  And you know.... no offense to those in here...but I am pretty sick of the term "Mainstream" as if a band getting popular makes them suddenly bad.  At the end of the day, not everybody is going to talk about Necrophagist, or FleshMould or Opeth (which is getting pretty mainstream too, IMO), and even some of us who are not "Mainstreamers" don't really care about some of those bands.<br>  <br>  So...why we get upset over it is beyond me.  Don't like a Q...ignore it.   Tired of the bands being discussed?  Bring something to the table.  I'm down to listen to, and discuss almost anything.<br>  <br>  But this whole "Us and Them" mentallity is one of the reasons there is so much drama in this section, not people liking Mainstream bands.<br>  <br>  MQ1- obZen<br>  It is simply their best.  They are one of those bands that is still getting better each and every album.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGzlc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGz...</a><br>  MQ2- Arch Enemy.  I like DT a LOT, but Arch Enemy just is one of those bands that really seems to be the perfect sound for ME. Mike Amott has long  been my favorite guitarist, and there are few drummers that I think can hold a candle to Danny. Although they are in danger of being one of the more mainstream MeloDeath Bands.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZM-d2qD15E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZM-d2qD1...</a><br>  MQ3- Melancholy (Holy Martyr)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGzmXUCnxrE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGzmXUCnx...</a><br>  <br>  ****Devil'sReject........  BOW to the Bacon, Brother!|`|VFc9leFmaa	yes, so all the people who pretend to be "cool" by listening to Metallica could disappear ^^

Ow3O7h4caa	Your first house or the Ascendant is how you show yourself to others. That is a mask that you wear and that is how people see you. With  Aquarius rising,you have a desire to express in anoriginal way with a definite love/hate relationship with groups and organizations. You are individualistic and find it necessary to be your own person, in your own way.<br>  On the other hand, you are idealistic in your thinking with a distinct calling towards humanitarian efforts. You are acutely aware of any and all communications possibilities. You are natural networkers but must take care not to overextend yourself and lose connection toyour center.<br>  <br>  Uranus is your ruling planet which makes you self-reliant, independent,  with a strong and original intellect and a capacity for high mental studies, whether scientific, metaphysical or literary. Yo dislike rules, conventions, restraints. Sudden changes occur in life as can be expected with Uranus as your ruler and the good and evil that Uranus bestows are both likely to come about very unexpectedly.

Eruption by Eddie Van Halen. That song rips, with all the special techniques he uses. No one can play that song and make it sound like the original.

We don't know yet if she loses the baby or not.|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I don't know Sara but I am wondering why nobody has insisted on a DNA test because I am sure it will turn out not to be Dan's!|`|PPyMhRJAaa	Dan is not the father of Sams baby.|`|h1PCSrgDaa	isnt it lucas's baby???

otYIidtHaa	30 mile zone. i know that probably doesnt sound right, but I remember hearing it on the show. It is some reference to the area in hollywood where all the restaurants and nightclubs and shopping places are where the stars hang out. Paparazzi central.|`|d1cjF4Plaa	Thirty Mile Zone|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	I never thought about that...hmm...|`|btrMdy5Uaa	Thirty Mile Zone<br>  <br>  <br>  'TMZ' stands for "Thirty Mile Zone," a term which originated in the 1960s. Due to the growth of "on location" shoots, studios and various talent guilds established a "thirty mile zone" - outside of which shooting is considered to be a location shoot, requiring per diems and other travel and living expenses to be paid. The zone remains centered in Los Angeles around the old offices of The Association of Motion Pictures and Television Producers at Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards in California. It was often said that "Everything entertainment happens in the 'Thirty Mile Zone.'" So essentially, the "Thirty Mile Zone" represents the center of Hollywood.[5]
Q2t5fPNAaa	Personally, I loved it! The dark humor, and gross out gags were hysterical. Zack and Miri has the same kind of "dirty humor" that you would find in movies like Clerks 2, and Superbad. There is a lot of nudity, and sexual situations. Kevin Smith directed it, and had to fight for an R rating due to vulgarity. A lot of the jokes are current, but older audiences can definitely enjoy it too. I would say that it is definitely worth checking out.|`|vW69Nh07aa	It's dirty and funny, and even has characters worth caring for.  It has it all!  Be ready for unexpected comedic nudity, too, in the style of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall."  If any of the above makes you uncomfortable, though, this pic may not be for you.|`|aCcRsh7uaa	Jesus Christ man!  Can you please use some punctuation in your sentences?  You're a moron so you'll probably laugh at some of the dumber parts.  Just watch it so that a smart man, Kevin Smith, can have a few more bucks in his pocket.

I always wondered if there was anyone else who used to like that show, b/c no one that I've met even knew it existed.  I do kinda miss it, but it was super dorky.  I guess that's why I liked it, b/c I'm a major dork & proud of it!|`|dh48AkbCaa	i remember the '80s film with kelly le brock an anthony michael hall, it brings back so many memories, but i never watched the series|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	I liked especially when they got back at those bikers, It made me feel like I was invincable.|`|UTNF6mfZaa	I remember the sitcom but I didn't think it was as good as the movie.|`|nEKpYuVHaa	NOT AT ALL

Z15TM1VQaa	DNA2<br>  In the future, mankind faces a terrible dilemma: overpopulation! The origin of this epidemic has been traced to one young man named Junta who, in his time period, is destined to become the Mega-Playboy who fathers 100 children (though currently, he vomits uncontrollably whenever a woman gets near him!). Karin is a DNA Operator who has been sent back in time to put a stop to the budding playboy's hormones, but accidentally becomes the cause of his transformation! As if things couldn't get worse, is Karin actually... falling in love with Junta?!<br>  <br>  Ayashi no Ceres<br>  There is a legend of an angel who fell to Earth many years ago, and was forced to marry a man because he held the key to her only way home. Hundreds of years later, sixteen year old Mikage Aya is the reincarnation of Ceres, the vengeful angel, who must now fight for her life against her family and her own twin brother Aki, the reincarnation of her past evil husband...<br>  <br>  Yu Yu Hakusho<br>  Yusuke Urameshi was a normal middle school punk until he was hit andkilled by a car, while saving a child. His selfless action earned him theright to gain his life back and serve as a detective of the spiritworld, keeping the world of the living safe from a myriad of demons. But being reborn has its price: Yusuke must hatch a spirit beast that will develop according to his actions, and if he doesn't act in a good and honestmanner, it will eat his soul. Can Yusuke protect the human and spiritworlds and still manage to save himself in the process?<br>  <br>  Card Captor Sakura<br>  Kinomoto Sakura never imagined that by opening a book in her father's library, she'd be responsible for releasing wild magic into the world, yet that's exactly what she did. Too powerful to be let loose on the world, the magical Clow cards were sealed away long ago by their creator, Clow Reed. But all is not lost! For the guardian beast, Keroberos, was sealed along with the cards. Can Sakura, with the help of Keroberos, retrieve the cards before they wreak havoc on the town? <br>  <br>  G Gundam<br>  The year is Future Century 60; much of mankind now lives in colonies surrounding the earth. After being ravaged by countless wars, every four years the dominance over the colonies is decided in a martial arts tournament called the Gundam Fight. This year marks the 13th tournament, and Gundam Fighters representing their colonies have begun to gather. Their purpose is to fight, and fight, until only one remains to claim the title "Gundam of Gundams." But Domon Kasshu, Neo Japan’s representative, has another secret mission; and should he fail, all of mankind may pay the price. Gundam Fight! Ready! Go! <br>  <br>  Shinzo<br>  In the 22nd century, humanity came under attack by its own creation: the genetically-engineered Enterrans. While most of the population was wiped out, a scientist executed his final plan: to put his daughter, Yakumo, into stasis for five hundred years so that she may restore peace and humanity to the world. Now, in the present, Yakumo has awakened and begins her search for Shinzo, the legendary sanctuary that houses the last of mankind. She is joined by three friendly Enterrans - Mushra, Sago, and Kutal - but the remaining Enterrans believe that she is an evil monster and would like her dead. Together with her new friends, Yakumo will search for a path to Shinzo, all the while battling unfriendly enemies along the way.<br>  <br>  Aishiteruze Baby<br>  Whenever Kippei is at school, he has one thing on the mind: girls. From skipping class to cheesy lines, he'll do anything it takes to reel the ladies in, though he never seems to find the right person. But the bachelor lifestyle is soon to change when young Yuzuyu enters the picture. This five-year-old cutie has been abandoned by her mother, and is to be taken care of by none other than Kippei! Unfortunately for the both of them, Kippei has no experience raising a child, so the learning curve will be quite steep...<br>  <br>  Ouran High School Host Club<br>  Ouran High is a school for the extremely wealthy or, in Haruhi's case, the extremely talented. But no amount of talent will help when Haruhi accidentally drops an eight million yen vase in a music room. The vase was the property of Ouran High School Host Club, a group of attractive young men who, for a fee, provide their time and affections for their lovesick clientele: the female students. Fascinated by this strange new specimen, a poor and clumsy commoner, they force Haruhi to work for them until the debt is repaid; but they get a lot more than they bargained for...<br>  <br>  Zoids Chaotic Century<br>  Van always wanted a zoid of his own and always goes out to some old ruins near his village. One day he was being chased by some bandits on his way to the ruins. He had gotten stuck in the ruins so he decided to go and look around in them, that’s where he had found an orginoid, that gave him his own zoid, and a zoidian (Feona) that didn't remember anything from her past. So Van decided to help her and left the village with those two following him. That’s were their story begins. &<br>  Zoids Guardian Force<br>  Van and Feona haven’t found many things out about Feona's past but they have gained a good reputation. This time they are defiantly going to find out what happened in Feona's past.|`|lmCw14Liaa	hey i hope these help you :)<br>  <br>  Inuyasha <br>  Fushigi Yuugi <br>  Vision of Escaflowne <br>  Saiunkoku Monogatari <br>  Romeo x Juliet<br>  Mermaid Melody<br>  Mermaid Melody Pure<br>  Mobile Suit Gundam Seed <br>  Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny<br>  Zero No Tsukaima (season 1)<br>  Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi (season 2)<br>  Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo (season 3)<br>  Lamune<br>  Tokyo Mew Mew<br>  Karin<br>  Sailor Moon<br>  Ai Yori Aoshi<br>  Final Approach<br>  Itazura Na Kiss<br>  Ayashi No Ceres<br>  Wolf's Rain<br>  Eureka Seven<br>  Fruit's Basket<br>  Mai Hime<br>  Chrono Crusade <br>  Clannad<br>  He Is My Master<br>  Magister Negi Magi Negima!<br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry if they are not the ones your looking for. :(|`|YyaKq8praa	I know the PERFECT ones!!!!<br>  Here is an answer I gave to someone else.<br>  (Don't worry, it's my answer, but here:)<br>  ~Definately Tsubasa!=13+<br>  It's like Cardcaptors when they grow up!<br>  Here's what it's like :D<br>  and the link<br>  What it's like:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa:_Re..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa:_Re...</a><br>  <br>  ~The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhi_Suzu..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhi_Suzu...</a> 13 year old or 15+<br>  <br>  ~School Rumble: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_rumb..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_rumb...</a><br>  <br>  ~Fruits Basket: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Bask..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Bask...</a><br>  <br>  ~Death Note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_note=" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_note=</a> Mature 13 yer old or 15+<br>  <br>  ~ Ouran High School Host Club: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouran_High_..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouran_High_...</a><br>  <br>  ~Tokyo Mew Mew: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_mew_m..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_mew_m...</a><br>  <br>  ~Cardcaptor Sakura: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardcaptor_..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardcaptor_...</a> =Everyone<br>  <br>  ~Bleach: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(ani..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(ani...</a><br>  <br>  ~Naruto:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto=(eng..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto=(eng...</a> (Japanese= 13+/14+)<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps <br>  :D<br>  Hunny Bridge~|`|zJ2GKkwAaa	*Itazura Kiss<br>  *The wallflower<br>  *Soul Eater
GaGrw9qqaa	yeah?....name one, i will show you a way around it....|`|f1e25342ff66537c8180df460a4b389eaa	Im not sure if you mean that you are concerned about people making illegal copys or if you mean another artist stealing your song. the only way to protect it 100 percent is to not let anyone here it.<br>  1. If someone can hear the music then they could easily record it onto a computer or another cd. there is no way around that.<br>  2. you can copyright the music, but that doesn't mean that others can't play it. once its copyrighted basically anyone who plays the song on there cd can do so with out permission as long as they send a letter of intent first and give you royalties, which amounts to nine cents a song, per copy.
YSRXarooaa	I know. Its like wow there are millions of women everywhere that get beaten EVERYDAY badly by their husbands or boyfriends. and now suddenly some stupid whore celebrity gets beaten and suddenly the world cares about her but not all the poor innocent women who get beaten and no one does anything about them because they aren't famous? wow the world is really stupid and sad.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	And now she's talking about getting back together with dude - so she's not even a good role model.<br>  <br>  Men that abuse women should have their d**ks chopped off.|`|N8DgVu9Aaa	now you say this your right. It's cuz everyday women don't have paparazzi interested in their every move (THANK GOD!!!) <br>  <br>  its important to bring this up as many people get beaten up everday & its horrible... besides although it is a terrible shame Chris did this (though why people are surprised stars flip about little things who knows as none of us know how pressuring it is to be followed pretty much ALL the time)<br>  <br>  anyway Chris hadn't done this before -to MOST peoples knowledge- & women get beaten up AT LEAST ONCE A DAY!!! though it's bad people should turn their attention to NoRmAl people (by normal i mean not famous)<br>  <br>  <br>  if you can be bothered to readd all of that ^ ^ ^ well done LOL|`|BcrYBSJmaa	Yes, it's because she's a celebrity,and it's because people paid money for Chris Brown's music, people had respect for him, people looked up to him,and he's disappointed everyone. But yes, it's unfair, and happens everyday and nothing gets done. But then again, this is the same in lots of issues.|`|m5hzMP97aa	I know. I completely don't get it either. Like everyday people are beaten-- much worse than she is in some countries. And they can't even get help! Their husband threatens them, saying I'll kill you if you call the police. Do I have sympathy for her? Of course! But the whole world shouldn't start crying because this happened to Rihanna.|`|2NzsJU4Jaa	Please don't stop the music....|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I understand why!<br>  I don't like Rihanna but what happened to her and happens to millions of women is very unfortunate but I think that the situation is getting the publicity needed.<br>  I'm sure people would be complaining if the Rihanna situation WASN'T on the news but because it is been so highly publicized, maybe the situation can help other women suffering from domestic violence.<br>  <br>  The media can't just ignore it because that would be wrong and also, it's a good story if you look at it from a Journalists point of view. Its something that everyone wants to know about because it's shocking that two very loved hip hop artists have been caught up in this situation.<br>  <br>  Basically, other women who are been abused by their boyfriends/husbands might see the Rihanna/Chris Brown thing on the news and re-evaluate their own situations.<br>  Thats why its good!|`|PHkDtKcVaa	Idk the ***** is so ******* stupid!!!!!!!!! dum ***** took chris brown  back just cause he promise so much ****!

He's a genius.<br>  <br>  My favorite album of his (post VU) is Songs for Drella with John Cale, but if that doesn't count, I'll just say Transformer.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Yes. He drives me wild.|`|3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa	Yes.  I had an album of his (i somehow lost)...  I 'think' the album was called 'Legendary Hearts' and that song is still my favorite Lou Reed song.  The only other stand-out track from that album was a cool song called 'Martial Law'.  <br>  Of course I like his older/more popular stuff but, being into Atari, I liked his semi-novelty song 'Little Red Joystick'....lol<br>  <br>  Walk On The Wild Side is the best alternative song ever written; even though it came out 20 years before alternative was actually a genre...lol|`|8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	Velvet Underground rule! His solo stuff goes back and forth between greatness and not-so-greatness. <br>  <br>  Pale Blue Eyes is a gorgeous song, both musically and lyrically, depicting a complicated relationship beyond what most "pop" songs strive to do.|`|wO5FP6Mqaa	Yes, his work with The Velvet Underground is simply amazing.  I love "The Velvet Underground and Nico" especially "Sunday Morning" and "Heroin".|`|GhI9wYUiaa	He's pretty good, but not my favorite.<br>  <br>  Favorite song: A Walk On The Wild Side|`|adLSRFrZaa	'Walk on the Wild Side' is such a unique, amazing song.|`|XBV6DP84aa	Hell yeah!<br>  <br>  Do you know he inspired Tim Curry's look for Rocky Horror?<br>  <br>  *swoons* <br>  <br>  The original guyliner :-D <br>  <br>  I love him.

The Chili Peppers are great and all, but most of the songs I listen to by them are off their album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and literally about 85% of the songs on that album have either "mother******" in them or some sort of sexual reference. I like Nirvana because they can write great lyrics and not swear.|`|HklLOqKkaa	haha my user name is GreenDayRHCPnirvanaSims. so, RHCP, Nirvana, and Green Day are all tied to me. RHCP and Nirvana's style of music are completely different, I would rather listen to Nirvana, honestly, but you gotta love Flea on that bass..mmmm...ha|`|vJYesZ5Zaa	I would say that both groups bring something different to the table, Red Hot Chilli Peppers has the flow, where Nirvana has the lyrics. I believe that both bands are great!!!!|`|rSIF5jtSaa	Wow that is a tough one. I would say Red Hot Chili Peppers because, I like more of their albums.

It took me a while to find the free version(there is an option to pay) but I eventually did and now I have MANY MANY song on my Ipod which I got for free!<br>  <br>  Once you download lime, download all the songs you want, and then open up a windows music folder and use your mouse to drag them to that folder! Then go to itunes and click the file menu and go down to click on "add folder" or add music folder or something like that! All your songs will download! Its kind of a long process but it works! Not all of the songs will download probably but you have to remember, it IS free music!<br>  <br>  Good luck! If you have any questions, e-mail me to ask!!!|`|Ar1mJHjxaa	If you need albums then you download from UTorrent but if you need just one song from some album then download from Lime Wire
BlA60kDVaa	Monitoring, so the performer can hear themself.  <br>  <br>  It is very important that a good mix and monitoring is present when people play/sing on stage.  When bands play at venues you will often have at least 2 sound engineers.  One to mix what the crowd hears and another engineer to make sure every musician can hear themselves properly in the mix when they are playing.  <br>  <br>  The monitoring engineer will often have a separate mixing desk and amplification system (P.A.) - and he/she will usually be situated next to the stage so they can make eye contact with the performing artists should a musician need extra levels to hear themselves if they are drowned out by the other members of the band.<br>  <br>  When a band plays at a venue they will have a sound check before the performance.  The band or performer/s will play a few songs from their set that they are going to play at their gig/concert.  A sound check is often a lengthy process of setting up microphones and DI (direct injection).  The engineer/s will then ensure that a good mix is achieved from the desk and then to the P.A. systems.  They will then go round each member of the band to ensure they can hear themsleves in their personal or shared monitors.<br>  <br>  There are two types of monitoring systems, wedges (fold back) speakers which are often found in front of each musician on the stage, angled towards them at around 45 degrees, hence the name "wedge".<br>  <br>  Another form of monitoring is the in-ear type.  They fit in such a way that they cut out all outside noise (closed monitoring ear pieces) and a comfortable mix is then fed into each musicians individual ear pieces.<br>  <br>  This is a more expensive and professional method of monitoring.  Not all musicians will want the in-ear type monitoring ear-pieces, so they will be happy with the traditional fold-back speaker monitors.|`|AA10833602	Usually it is so that they can communicate with the stage directors behind the scenes on what song they are performing next.<br>  It is also used for keeping a steady beat, especially for the drummer, so a rhythmic clicking noise is played so that the drummer doesnt go out of sync.|`|SlKjWh0paa	they are ear monitors. normally they use wedge type p.a. speakers on stage so they can hear what's coming from the p.a. (microphone) but in the last couple years they've come out with wireless ear pieces like hearing aids that connect to the p.a. and allow the singer to hear what they are singing into the microphone exactly like what the crowd hears|`|X4vSvSqpaa	So they can hear themselves over the drummer and the noisy crowd|`|VXcp8hvHaa	earpieces<br>  cuzz<br>  earpieces<br>  your welcome<br>  ooo|`|4uB0bbhnaa	my son is in a band and they wear ear plugs to protect their ears<br>  from the constant loud music and <br>  <br>  this helps them to protect against and future deafness due to the constant exposure to very loud music

They turn a few knobs and then just stand there for a while.  If you're going to make noise, at least put some effort into it.  They have yet to create, at least for me, a really interesting or compelling soundscape, there are some good ideas on Street Horrsing though - it was a solid effort.<br>  <br>  It was not nearly as bad as a keyboardist I once saw open for Sonic Youth.  He pulled out some scotch tape and taped down a bunch of keys, turned a few knobs and then sat down in a folding chair for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.  I forget the name of the band/artist/whatever....

yjSGVfdiaa	Honey Bucket is one of my favorites by the Melvins.  It shows off Dale Crover's drums to great effect, and is a highlight on Houdini.<br>  <br>    If you enjoy Houdini make sure you check out "A Live History of Gluttony and Lust"  - it's the Melvins performing the Houdini album in its entirety, live, something they had never done before.  Many of the songs on there were never performed live up to that point.<br>  <br>  Definitely always happy to see more Melvins fans - they're in my top 5.<br>  Thanks for sending me the link.<br>  <br>  Fun fact:  The bass player on Houdini was Shirley Temple's daughter.  <br>  <br>  BA:  People obsess - it's a bit scary sometimes.  Though, I do remember being particularly struck when I first heard of his death.  <br>  <br>  BA2:  How about some Riot Grrl?<br>  Bikini Kill, Babes in Toyland, Sleater-Kinney and the like<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Oh, and I don't know if you've listened to Flipper - but they were an influence on the Melvins and Nirvana.

The Melvins are definitely underrated.<br>  <br>  BA:  I don't think theres anything wrong with caring.  I care. Most people care about the deaths of their favorite musicians.  I don't care more about his death than his music though, not by any means.  I think it's ridiculous how much people talk about it though, and how people spin crazy conspiracy theories blaming Courtney and whatnot. <br>  BA2: how about Pavement?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH26savQpvY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH26savQp...</a>|`|dQvKvnVuaa	Hey there!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I have actually heard that song before! I am a youtube junkie! <br>  <br>  1. I get VERY sick of people talking about Kurt's death. RIP--and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  2. Song of the days-and it's a 90's one! (1993). It's by a band called Savatage, and it's called "Conversation Piece".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53vD8isThM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53vD8isT...</a>|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Hey there, fellow Texan Lily!<br>  <br>  I've never really been able to get into the Melvins. I love Mastodon, like Tool, but no the Melvins. Tsk, tsk.<br>  <br>  BA: Yeah. Whenever I wear my Nirvana shirt, people ALWAYs poin to Kurt and go "Didn't he commit suicide?" It pisses me off...<br>  <br>  BA2: Well, it's metal, but I think most of ya'll can handle it.

I posted that Axl Rose killed him on a message board and people thought i was for real.|`|9BVtdJ1Uaa	Well I'm not much of a reg, but I'm an occ and (BQ) yes, people go on way too much about Kurt's death. I'm really not much of a fan of the ones who continuously drag out conspiracy theories that he was killed by someone. Feel free to think what you will about it, but enough with the trying to push it on everyone. (Not saying I'm one way or the other on what really happened, just not my mission in life to try and prove it to everyone listening)<br>  <br>  Anyway, getting to BQ2, my nominee is what I have to say is an underrated band, very familiar to Nirvana by chance.<br>  Greasebox by Tad> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0l-Oqabipk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0l-Oqabi...</a>|`|LwqM7EHVaa	I'm sorry but I didn't like the song, I'm not really into metal to be honest.. But thanks for the link anyways =)<br>  <br>  BQ: I can see how some people really want to know what happened, but it's ridiculous how they never stop talking about it. It becomes more of an obsession to know what happened, instead of mentioning that he might not have killed himself..<br>  <br>  BQ2: Camel - Watching The Bobbins<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPAJqU2Muj0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPAJqU2Mu...</a><br>  <br>  Stereophonics - Mr. Writer (my favorite music video..)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBlhBhVx6A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBlhBhVx...</a>|`|M9g7ZZcMaa	I would vote down in a hole by alice in chains, since that is what I am listening to. <br>  <br>  <br>  yeah, I love the melvins!<br>  and I also completely agree. Just because you put R.I.P KURT!!!11! on your myspace/facebook doesnt make you "nirvana's biggest fan" <br>  I bet Kurt would role over in his grave at the thought of people making such a big deal about it.|`|SmVHRpr5aa	I've been meaning to give The Melvins a listen for a long time now, but I guess I've been putting it off. Thanks a lot for posting this man.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I must confess, it's just not my thing.

I prefer to focus on his music.<br>  <br>  BA2: I dunno, I liked that song by The Breeders (I think it was last week?) Maybe something along those lines.|`|2i6TPlauaa	It was okay; not as epic as Radio Waves' post though.<br>  <br>  BQ: And John Lennon. And Hendrix.

I got a 93 on my math retake today, so next week when we start clinical at the hospital I will be allowed to give medications to patients! Yay! Nursing school is tough!<br>  <br>  My plans for the weekend involve alot of studying. I have a huge exam on Wednesday that I have to get a good grade on.<br>  <br>  To answer about this song: I am not crazy about it, but I loved the intro.<br>  Just not my taste.<br>  <br>  BA: Yes, I think it is a bit much.<br>  <br>  BA2: I will suggest one from one of my favorite bands from that time, the Gin Blossoms.

But my favorite song by them A History of Bad Men.<br>  <br>  Bq:  I can understand how people make a big deal out of it, i mean i like The Beatles a lot, and i'm upset John and George are dead still, so if people want to miss Kurt go ahead, i miss him too, but yes you have to accept their passing.<br>  BQ2:  Did you do any Beck yet?  if not he's great also, radiohead would be cool also.<br>  <br>  I fogot to mention my day, i'm so happy it's Friday, long week of tests, and i had midterm exams all week, *yawn* and that was rough, and then in music class in school we had to sing Viva La Vida *sigh* and my history project got pushed back to be due to March 9th or sometime around then which is awesome, because i'm a procastinator.  As for my weekend, i'm going to garage sale to find a record player, and i'm getting my last Beatles CD to finish my collection.  So it's going alright.  I'm going to watch Tallageda Nights on TBS tonight also.<br>  <br>  As for your awwwwwww R&P, i answered this once it came up, it just took me real long to type all of this.

9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	I've never known any Leos and Scorpios that failed so I would say you have a great chance of being happy.  Possibly the only issue is you both are alpha type people (charging ahead of everyone else) but I don't see why this one cannot last.|`|7rrNvFK7aa	That is going to be hard on account that Scorpio will try to control the relationship and leo will not take to being bossed around.<br>  Sex is often on the agenda with a Leo and Scorpio and attraction at first sight happens often.  But the chances of a long-term relation is harder with time. Leo is easy to manipulate. just praise him and give him attention. But not Scorpio and you may take advantage of that.<br>  You are too temperamental for Leo.<br>  <br>  libra sign|`|yGRNTYIaaa	Honestly: don't depend on horoscopes to determine your life.  If he's the one for you, you'll know by how y'all get along with each other, make decisions with one another, etc.|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	that don′t depend on astrology if you really like him and he really likes you it will last|`|7daXMkU9aa	if u really care about this guy which u must do 2 put up w/ him 4 a couple of years i think yall can make it work|`|j9OUIki3aa	Even though you have a square sun sign pattern (which can make communications more of a challenge) there are benefits to your combination.<br>  <br>  I am a Leo also, and sometimes appreciate the intensity of Scorpios.  At least they also see things passionately, as Leos do.  It just gets hard for Leos to understand how they communicate.  Leos want to climb onto a stage and call out how they feel- while Scorpios.....  well I haven't figured out how to understand them myself.  Just try to appreciate that his differing communication styles don't mean less of him or his feelings; Scorpios are just mysterious.|`|GBRmOem8aa	Chances are that you are an accomplished individual who needs to feel as though you are productive and respected within your sphere. You take pride in your efforts to meet the needs of the community and are often employed in jobs that are risky, dangerous and intense, requiring specific skills combined with courage. There are many police officers, firefighters, and doctors who are born under the influence of Scorpio.<br>  <br>  Leos are also deeply sincere in their efforts, but they tend to be more grandiose and flamboyant in the outer world, sometimes grabbing the limelight away from less showy signs. If your Leo underestimates your value by stealing attention or making light of your worth, you will find it intolerable and probably cut off the relationship.<br>  <br>  You and your Leo lover are both fixed signs, and therefore can be quite stubborn in your own individual ways. Unless you have the Moon or Mars in a fire sign, you may see your partner as someone who wastes energy on the wrong things. Click here to find out where the Moon and Mars are in your chart.<br>  <br>  Even with other compatible planets, this relationship is fraught with tension. You'll surely need to compromise in significant ways and learn to respect each other's very different characters. If you can accept each other, there is a high level of loyalty in each of you that can make this become a lasting union.

1Mc6BOvKaa	I am also a Royal Mail employee. <br>  <br>  Royal Mail is still a wholly owned subsidiary of the UK Government. The UK Government is an agent of the Queen, who act on the "authority of the crown". <br>  <br>  So technically, in a roundabout way, you could say us postmen work for the Queen.<br>  <br>  Anyone who works in any form of Government service (NHS, Police, Taxmen, Firemen, etc) all technically work for the Crown. When I'm feeling jokey, and people ask me what I do for a living, I tell people I work for the Queen, but never really seriously. I expect your brother is just joking too.|`|TwrGic9Uaa	All he should worry about is that her face is on the notes in his wallet when he gets paid.  Yes, I would say, he works for the Queen.|`|OzPheiN1aa	technically yes although it is the crown he works for not the queen|`|HmqHf3qDaa	actually yes he does,|`|ZawzpmaGaa	Um does he live in england or something|`|MU0EylAaaa	no, there is a comapny with that logo but not for the queen!|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	No I don't think he is|`|Szou6m1Caa	i would believe in him if i were you|`|6bMBwaosaa	Not anymore thanks to increasing privatisation!

I work for God! I'm the janitor at a church. No better boss in the universe. And at least with Him, I know better than to get in an argument with Him and say "Oh yeah?

OUtcHIm0aa	You need to start from the beginning because if you don't you might not understand a lot. And it's good the first season it starts off a little slow but around episode 13 it gets amazing and the same for other seasons. They kind of explain the story arcs and than all at once they kind of merge together or they solve them all and everything makes sense. But to answer your question. The show is great. :D|`|vvTrmHtxaa	love it.fav show.<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|AA10954273	The first season was great.  Second, not so good, especially since it was cut short by the WGA strike.

There are a lot of things not quite logic to me:<br>  <br>  How Nathan was healed from the shot? I thought Linderman was just an illusion which created by Matt's father, can illusion heal as well?<br>  <br>  I didn't realized Issac get to draw so many episode more of the "9th Wonders" before he died.<br>  <br>  If the eclipse took everyone's power away, how come Arthur still stay healthy whereas Dhapne (hope i spell the name correctly) the speed runner went paralyzed.<br>  <br>  What took Noah so long to shoot Sylar and Elle in the house? I guess he actually enjoying the show.<br>  <br>  If Claire can just walk out the hospital without being question further after she get shot, died, and revive, why Noah so worry about sending her to hospital? Just doesn't make sense because I thought the police paid a visit to the hospital.<br>  <br>  If the Hasian temporarily disabled Arthur's power, perhaps the Hasian surroundings, how come Sylar still be able to use his power in the same room? Is it because the Hasian exhausted while dealing with Arthur?<br>  <br>  One more thing before I forgot, what happen to the girl called Catheline or something, which accidentally being teleported to the future by Peter in season 2 but not able to come back to present day, anyone have any news on her?<br>  <br>  Really, at first season 1 was awesome, then season 2 makes me feel like I'm watching X-Men or something because they are no longer special to me, more and more people having powers some with nonsense power (sorry to say that) like Maya's and now even Ando has power, but then Season 3 really disappointing as is a mess and character being killed easily, Elle was killed just because she knows who's Sylar parents are but didn't bother to tell him, what is this all about, I thought they are in love or something. Knox was also another hero die easily :(|`|zovrJ0yXaa	if you have never seen it before, do yourself a favour and watch the first season, then stop. just stop. season 2 wasnt terrible but it was idsappointing and season 3 has been appalling so far. it really ruins the show to watch it. season 1 was excellent tv and stands by itself. its definitely worth watching by itself|`|GaGrw9qqaa	I wouldn't just jump right in.....You need to connect to the characters an be familiar with their power and who is good and who is evil...I think watching it midway through this season would ruin it for you.|`|m80GjPWfaa	so ur starting off with the bomb strapped to parkman huh? i don't think its the proper place to start, only because u'll ruin it for yourself, season 1 was amazing, watch it, season 2, u can get away with reading episode recaps/watching the 2 minute breakdowns online, and season 3, get recaps for the first few episodes and once u get to the SPOILERS:::::::: once you get to the plane crash, watch the episodes for real. u can get 2 minute recaps online of all the episodes check it out. if u watch all of them, basically watch the whole series 2 minute recaps to this point (episode 52) it will take u like: only 2 hours. <br>  <br>  however! u can't get all the recaps online, so just youtube 'heroes summary season 1' or something, u'll get what u want. <br>  <br>  also! it's possible to just start watching the show now, i mean it will be terribly confusing, but if u just want to watch an episode just watch it, u might like it and then go back to watch the previous episodes.|`|vxUoVi6saa	The first few seasons were good but now the episodes are boring|`|36MfXn7Saa	Love it.

u6Fhrs8naa	Other gender, huh? Well, it's obvious that their appearance matters...and their eyes. Without the amazing eyes, I would file those guys as aliens... Also, his personality will really matter to me. If he treats me properly and will care for me no matter what, I can say automatically say that he'll be the one for me. :-) Oh, and if he smells like some dog who just did his business...it's a definite no. And...he has to look out for me and vice versa. I'm sure no one would want a boyfriend who stands with you during a fight you're having with someone, and says: "I'm outta here", when the hands and feet pop in. <br>  <br>  Um, I'm plotting murder plans for my crush's girlfriend...Hah!

RavvDVpVaa	I'd say it is a classic, if your young and weren't around listening to it in 1991 when it first came out you should listen to 2 other de la soul albums before you listen to that<br>  <br>  You should listen to <br>  <br>  Stakes Is High<br>  then<br>  Buhloone Mindstate<br>  then<br>  De La Soul is dead<br>  <br>  It will make you appreciate them more|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I like De La Soul Is Dead the best out of their work...|`|6GbyhpTMaa	POT HOLEZ IN MY LAWN|`|xmdh8iY3aa	No its not. Too many stupid skits and filler on it. Definitely a notch below their epic 3 Feet High and Rising.<br>  <br>  I rate the album a solid 8/10 mainly due to 3 tracks<br>  <br>  A Roller Skating Jam Named Saturdays (my fav De La Soul song)<br>  Keepin the Faith<br>  Pass the Peas (an unheralded Prince Paul production, some of his best work)<br>  <br>  Yes it also has Ring,Ring,Ring (Hey,Hey,Hey), Ooodles of O's, Talkin Bout Hey Love which are decent tracks but the album lacks the consistency of a classic release.|`|3drMJB1maa	I like 3 Feet High and Rising better.<br>  <br>  9/10 for De La Soul is Dead

5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	My neighbor to my left is rude! She had a conversation with me once and she was so condescending.  Plus she was talking crap about Catholics (I"m catholic) at work.<br>  <br>  My neighbor to my right is pretty cool. He comes over all the time, but last time he came over he called me a fat butt!!! :(  LOL<br>  <br>  The guy across the hall I don't know him.  But he has REALLY REALLY loud sex and that gets annoying. Plus he tries to mask it with music by turning his stereo up and it is annoying at 2am when I have to wake up at 5am.|`|U0FgxEJxaa	Most of our neighbors are really decent people.  A couple of the husbands across the street have passed away recently (so did my Dad) and another man suffered a massive heart attack last year, but is doing great in recovery.  We don't know everyone, but ones we are friends with are great people!  I wish I could say the same for the neighbors on either side of us!|`|fwBIXZxPaa	Well, one of our neighbors is sort of like a stalker. o.O She looks at what we're doing from her house. But, she is a good baker, and she brings us A LOT of stuff, too. =)<br>  <br>  Our other neighbors are rude. They're mom works at the doctor's office I go to, and she's mean. And their son (whose a year older than me) is an idiot.<br>  =P|`|G5weg8gCaa	My neighbors are nice, but I wish I had a neighbor that brought food for us.

kAIXDVu1aa	Taylor Swift<br>  Jonas Brothers<br>  Aly&AJ<br>  Paramore<br>  Demi Lovato not all songs <br>  Jesse McCartney<br>  Natasha Bedingfield<br>  Definatelly TOKIO HOTEL <br>  Britney Spears but not alol of them <br>  <br>  THERES ALOT MORE BUT MOST ARTIST WHO START SINGING LIKE KATY PERRY, DEMI LOVATO ETC. THEY DON'T WRITE THERE OWN SONGS AT FIRST ... OTHER PPL WRITE IT 4 THEM|`|DaokQBKhaa	There is a big distinction between bands and singers who sing because they want to express themselves and reach out to their  listenerers and the ones who want fame and only want to reach out into their listeners pockets.<br>  <br>  Since you clearly have some intelligence, you should probably avoid manufactured pop like the Backstreet Boys and that Miley Cyrus etc.|`|ImOcVhwLaa	Taylor Swift<br>  Jonas Brothers<br>  Aly&AJ<br>  Paramore<br>  Demi Lovato wrote 9 of 11 songs on her debut album<br>  Jesse McCartney<br>  Natasha Bedingfield<br>  Marie Digby|`|cUT7n5gOaa	2nd's answer's taste is horrible.|`|EfrjXMZkaa	katy perry writes some of her music, paramore writes all their songs. and the veronicas write most of their stuff|`|XvF38juvaa	most bands write their own songs and lots of singers do too or at least co-write them.<br>  <br>  But singer are exactly that, Singers not Songwriters and some of them just don't have the talent to write cathcy songs and hooks!!<br>  <br>  they could have a brilliant voice though so they hire songwriters to write them songs. Usually they find a handful of good songwriters lisen to all the demo's and then choose a song that they like , that they will enjoy singing, that they can sing and then they change it around to suit there style.<br>  <br>  They don't just Sing someone else's song they make it their own!|`|3WNU97oiaa	most anyone who isn't a "pop singer solo artist".<br>  <br>  that doesn't include all solo artists, just pop ones. Taylor Swift, for instance writes her own songs and even turned down a recording contract because they wouldn't let her do so, and they're very lovely.<br>  <br>  pop musicians like justin "i press a button on a synth and it makes music for me" timberlake and brittney spears use the masses of wealth they gain from their               fans to hire people to write their ugly songs for them.|`|g12oBzpUaa	All i know iz that Mariah carey write her own song|`|bT3EgS0Jaa	jesse mccartney|`|FHBpJ3qvaa	when i saw ur question i was going 2 say tokio hotel, but u probably know that already.
ArKT9O7Maa	Hannah Montana.<br>  And I think iCarly is a pretty good show.  But they should give Spencer his own show.|`|Gfjbp30Maa	I believe that iCarly is probably far worse that Hannah Montana. While they are not the greatest of actors, Miley Cyrus and the rest of the actors that appear on the show have far more experience and as a result, are more famous. On the iCarly show, the characters are not as developed or convincing. However, they are both great shows for young audiences. Obviously, older kids and adults probably do not find them nearly as thrilling as children, so that is why our opinions are harsh.<br>  <br>  Patricia.|`|dnukV1qEaa	I don't like to say bad things about shows like that, but I agree that the iCarly cast can't act except Spencer, but I am also saying that you just can't get on the internet and start commenting bad things about T.V shows that you don't like. It's like me saying "I hate you, Hannah Montana!" Well, I kind of like Hannah Montana and it's not that bad. You might not like it, but little kids do and if you say things like this to shows that they watch, they do the same thing and that's not right. You are leaving a bad impression for those kids. I suggest that you stop.<br>  I hope you understand!!! :)|`|AA11883855	Hannah Montana is the worst, your right, Spencer is the only cool and funny one on that show, but pretty much both are crap.  Nickelodeon is crap and i don't watch anything on that channel|`|fJichSMhaa	definetly icarly,  not on of them can act there, but i like carly's brother spencer he's funny besides him i don't like anyone of them especially carly|`|lJ9I4L6Xaa	Definetly Hannah Montana. <br>  She is horrible, I hate her, no more conversation, goodbye.|`|eH54r81Aaa	Hannah montana.<br>  ew.|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	iCarly.

Can't stand it. xD<br>  Cool actors i guess, even tho they can't act, and atleast the main girl can sing half decently unlike miley, but I just don't like it.<br>  Then again, they had fred on their show and i love him!<br>  <br>  So Hannah Montana is worse, by a little, but I prefer the HM cast, minus Miley. <br>  <br>  x|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Both shows have bad acting, terrible acting actually.<br>  <br>  I agree, that Spencer guy should have his own show...<br>  <br>  But because Hannah Montana's show has worse acting, i'll say Montana is worse.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	Hannah Montana all day<br>  <br>  I agree spencer is kinda funny but everyone else just sucks.

If there isn't there should be!! :o) <br>  But Yeah! he' so funny, look like he's gonna turn on the water works!|`|XAAF7R23aa	yes it was classic,  it is getting to be like a comedy show, but still well worth watching, i am really going to enjoy the wedding, do you think we should send a pressie, lol, and the norris's love life story line has me in stitches|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	David cracks me up I mean what teen lad uses curling tongs on his hair and then makes it like an old lady perm and his orange face lol<br>  Good tonight total agree can't wait for wedding on Friday and oh poor Lloyd think he really does like Liz.|`|LkA4FkMZaa	I think that Gail Platt must have learnt from her mistakes now <br>  <br>  i think she is an idiot and so is her son<br>  <br>  im glad that they have split up<br>  <br>  my view|`|LWXMUmFOaa	it was great david was very funny tonight i hope joe leaves i hate him|`|goo7zzqWaa	hmm... his face is, ill give him that!<br>  poor gail. shes so unlucky in love|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	David is warped, he's total nuts, it was a very show tonight yes, 4 relationships on the rocks, lol|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	It was priceless - all accusing each other and all the skeletons coming out!!!  Some great acting there too.|`|Um8osMNuaa	Excellent episode, the Platt's at it again with their family dramas, does Gail never learn, she should steer clear of men, always gets the dodgy ones. Eileen would have loved it.<br>  <br>  What about Dev's Uncle, and what went wrong with Dev's voice, the way he talks is bad at the best of times, but that stupid voice he put on when talking to him, strange, very strange.|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	I missed it.I will watch it on line or the omnibus.<br>  I hate David so much.With a bit of luck he'll go to his dad for a bit and give us a break from seeing his Oh I'm so pretty face.<br>  <br>  Edit: Gail should stand up for herself,she is his mum not his sister,the way he talks to her is sick.She should throw him out.|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	yeah i missed the second half , so i watched it just now <br>  it was  very good Gail certainly picks them doesn't she ?|`|NmSSKnnWaa	what about the new bloke.devs uncle or something.<br>  have you ever seen a worse actor?
XFnHshOMaa	Not always, although some of them are married to people that aren't famous.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	They don't always get divorced but happy marriages don't sell tabloid papers.|`|AA10405438	I think they have way too many outside influences.  There are celebrities that have very long relationships:  Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgewick, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett.  In the spotlight all the time has to be tough.|`|lWpNEdMOaa	They get married for the Attention.<br>  Let me show you a perfect <br>  attention of a Celebrity Couple<br>  who got DIVORCED,<br>  <br>  Britney Spears & Kevin Ferderline <br>  just got married<br>  for Publicity.<br>  They also basically get divorced<br>  because they live their life's in<br>  front of a camera who is always <br>  following them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it Helps!|`|6dtAmXcAaa	Because they have a competition to see who is more famous. They end up fighting about it and leaving them.|`|ibpoLakuaa	i would think because they are always so busy that they never end up seeing each other. also maybe fame gets in between them?|`|K7TxTnxEaa	Many factors contribute to that. Some issues include the publicity, the constant under a microscope pressure, the pressure of a celebrity couple, and usually the fame of the person leads to them to cheat, do drugs, ect...|`|mmrF8ZYdaa	I would say that the biggest reason would be Attention - if a celebrity does something like get divorced, most likely the paparazzi will be right on it. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|a28669642ec8a0b98ed527c49e493dbeaa	Because they get married for the publicity!|`|PS9JIKR7aa	so do most people, just they are on tv so you know more.

HZxX9ke8aa	yes, each has their own challenges though. like, a water sign probably find capricorn too stern to approach. libra, too extroverted to find out that they have a sparkling mind in fact. virgo, too tactless and realist to feel secure with them. and sagittarius, being a fire sign and unpredictable, too extreme i guess.<br>  <br>  librans much more easier than the rest cause most of the time they will come talk to you while gathering their army of friends.<br>  <br>  scorpios going to see sagittarius people either very close to themselves or simply as their opponents. these two share much more than you would think. they appeal to same kind of people (dangerous guy/girl lovers) so they are kind of opponents indeed.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i'm a pisces and from experience...<br>  capricorn - too awkward... i always feel like i'm under pressure. i'd try my best to be serious and not joke around about everything because some capricorn are very serious people...<br>  libra - i can talk to libras for hours... we usually keep the conversations light. some philosophical topics come up every now and then but nothing serious, which is good.<br>  sagittarius - i always feel intimidated when i'm talking to a sagittarius. they always want to know your opinion on something and it's as if you have to expose part of your personality to them even when you're not ready yet. and i wouldn't dare to disagree with them because they hate everyone that disagrees with them...lol<br>  virgos - i just don't get them at all. i hardly know any virgos... they're too quiet and serious. most of the time, i think they just hate being around me...|`|d2uGruHiaa	I'm an earth sign and so far all water signs have gotten along with me. It's so easy to talk to me (Capricorn); really it is. We are practical people and it's all about realistic situations, so we tend to give you the realest piece of advice we could ever give anyone- especially if it's a water sign. (Emotions might take over)|`|5l2kTANaaa	Oh don't mind me...am only looking through the peephole :-)|`|ea4d2b5621053057aebac18e878c58e5aa	Water signs do mesh well with earth signs when it comes to intellect but the taurus is the most stubborn so even if you try to get them to hear new ideas if they don't like it, they won't budge at all.|`|cuIX13BKaa	Yes. Now for an answer. I am going beyond Sun Sign alone here. I have 3 planets in water....Cancer....I am a Virgo, mercury going mad there the mad woman prolific writer that i am. I have two planets in Libra....they all play like some celestial pinball game and it all fits..I wouldn't change a thing! It is simply fabulous! Intellect is the most important thing to me....the rest is just a wonderful topping on a fabulous meal! I have 3 in Leo as well....so I am fairly well rounded..and I have the patience of a saint..rarely get upset..every year or so...maybe..maybe not...for i see humanity for its foibles and it incredible beauty....why don't I get upset? I am perfectly flawed myself.....ok?<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	I'm a Scorpio and I admire the way that Capricorns have a way of keeping me grounded. They are more calm and don't let their emotions carry them away. Whenever I'm angry, I always call on my Capricorn friends to keep my feet on the ground and keep me from making stupid decisions. They are very rational and see things for what they really are. Water signs tend to get blinded by emotions. Many people think Caps are boring, but I can talk to them about anything for hours and hours. <br>  <br>  Whenever I'm with a Virgo, I always feel like an uncivilized caveman. They always know what's the best way to do things, best recommendations and such. I try not to argue with Virgos cause they actually do their research and know a bit too much...as in down to the last detail. So they keep my mind sharp. They can be quirky too. I love that about them.<br>  <br>  Libras and Sags are fun for me, but only in small doses. Libras strike me as kinda naive people who don't know better sometimes, and I just either worry about them or feel sorry for them. Sagittarius...I find more intelligent and I love that they are open-minded. But I only know very few so I can't speak too much of them. My boss is a Sag and I respect him very much.

fIxzUq5laa	If Taurus stop calling then it is pretty much over. We usually do not stop calling people out of the blue, there must be a reason for it and it is usually a good one.|`|GwEEEyNRaa	Do yourself a favour - drop the Taurus, I know from experience, they're not worth your trouble.|`|0F8hauikaa	It sounds over.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	stop calling. if he wants you he is sure to make his move.<br>  He knows what he wants, and he's not going to change his mind so its best to just leave him to show what he has decided
2qyHh1Uiaa	i have an rp 350 and its pretty cool.   you coukld play slipnot and other stuff.   it comes with preset cosounds and you can edit them or make your own.  YOu can find wat his setup is, copy it on the rp350 and then use it.  also you can create your own sound whether its a blues, classic rock, metal, trans, techno,  watver.  its great i bought it for 200 and i rly like it.  i suggest going for the rp 550 i think because you have more variety.    the wah pedal sux but the rest is good
lhzMzEYaaa	Assuming you are expecting an honest answer more than just a pleasing one, I am sorry I do not see this materialize into a long term relationship. Sorry to give you bad news. However it is not exactly bad, you'll actually be meeting someone, infact very close to where you live. Good luck.|`|ea4d2b5621053057aebac18e878c58e5aa	I sense that there is a very strong attraction between the two of you, almost like a magnetic pull in a way. But I also see that passion as being the cause for heated arguments down the road, which could cause the two of you to break up and get back together more then once. It'll be a little rocky after 4-6 months. I also would say that most psychics are frauds, about 90% of them are so don't believe 'em all, the real ones are out to help you with not expecting anything in return. I would try the psychic twins, they we're on the tyra show recently and are the most known dead on with knowing things, check 'em out.
OU4Mr9YFaa	Yep ist Episode 7, Season 1.<br>  Riots, Drills and the Devil Part 2|`|lGSbjuIuaa	I believe its Riots, Drills and the Devil: Part 2. after michael saves sara from all the inmates trying to get to her in the infermery.|`|E2xF2C1gaa	No it's not that episode.

Qrctjea3aa	automatically it is aesthetics that draw people in.<br>  -colors that don't clash<br>  ex: lime green background with red text IS BAD. <br>  -graphics that are in clear quality<br>  -easy navigation<br>  -inviting look, simple.<br>  Content, of course, is the main attraction but if the website looks crappy right of the bat people don't usually waste their time, no matter how great the info is.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	the laughs|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Free Beer..............|`|ac765fecf71e34144f9c20e6733b06d5aa	Colors and text. <br>  <br>  Not large paragraphs, please.

CIu4TkLVaa	your bf is a moron|`|5pjP5lqUaa	yeah, but seriously though, whats with all your question about your boyfriend? obsessed much? no offence, but your boyfriend sounds like an idiot to me.|`|1kJdrmrpaa	how come in like every one of your questions you say "my bf" or "my bf and i"??|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	No.  I wouldn't buy a product without a money back guarantee no matter how confident the seller was in their product.  As a consumer, whether or not it works is for ME to decide.|`|YcGNL9y1aa	Depends on what your boyfriend is selling!|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Most people are sure their product will work or they wouldn't put it out there. But if I saw that slogan I would have to give that a W/E. What if your bf was wrong or what if some of the products were defective? Then the buyer is SOL. That slogan is almost an oxymoron.<br>  Why am I answering this question seriously? Ha!|`|j0gtbpS1aa	no.  in theory yes, in practical terms, don't use it.  That would be the same as me offering a guarntee that you will like my photos. ain't gonna happen, even though I know you will.|`|eI5rgLcraa	or even better "We don't offer a money back guarantee because we're 100% confident our product will work"<br>  <br>  <br>  i think "We offer no " sounds kinda dumb|`|rVWPRYoEaa	awesome|`|N3ROX08kaa	well what if it doesn't work? some people might get pretty ticked about not getting their money back. and isn't a slogan supposed to be more like..... different. you know like mcdonalds... im loving it! and Ford.... built ford tough? i would say no its not a good SLOGAN, but an ok saying type thing. but i would say you should offer a money back gaurantee|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	i would not buy it, as  no matter how good the product is, in production at times flaws happen and if the thing dont work i want my money back|`|RcchpBX5aa	I wouldn't call that a slogan....<br>  It's a tactic that good help your sales or hurt your sales... it could go either way. Good Luck|`|3S3XjvYcaa	if it doesnt work there will be a lot of angry customers, if it definitely will then it's fine...|`|aXw1YNfEaa	is he going to apply it to hookers? if so, then its new and radical.|`|FBywNyw8aa	ummm <br>  it's ok...<br>  too long for a slogan<br>  pretty bad no offense<br>  sorry|`|PHOyKsmPaa	NO!|`|UdemZ27caa	sure, but prepare to get sued.

To me they should go where they can be private. That is just my opinion. Thanks|`|ngZ4edyjaa	when using cell phone in public they should speak quietly and if they speak loud enough, then they just invited me to eavesdrop.|`|gUdFFYNTaa	It doesn't bother me... but when they have the phone on speaker, and they are yelling it makes me mad.

It was a laugh to yourself type of thing more then a laughing out loud.

A girl that is so emotionally unstable, that dreams of death and darkness, that is so secure in these things that suicide is but a step away. But when the prince she sought intervenes within her plans, she runs... mortified, unable to accept what she has wanted for so long. When she finally comes to her senses, she sees the prince is destined to save her from herself, from the nightmare that came reality, from the monster she had become. She runs to him this time, weeping for the grace she had received, for she knows he can remove her sorrow.

PS0oSoXFaa	Well your requests are kind of all over the map! You should just get into classical music in general, you'll find lots of great stuff :) Get this book- it's fun, all accurate and well written, and while some classical music will be upset about the idea of "ranking" classical music, and I can see their point, you need to start somewhere. (I started listening for real with a best of Beethoven CD and a best of Tchaikovsky CD when I thirteen, which seems really funny now- but it still got me addicted!) I've studied music in college for years, and I still think it's a good book<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Music-Phil-G-Goulding/dp/0449910423" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Music-Ph...</a><br>  <br>  If you like "sad, angry and melancholy" pieces, try Beethoven's Pathetique and Appasionata sonatas. The middle movements are beautiful and almost anyone would like them on a first listen, but listen to the other movements too- while structure isn't something most people appreciate as much at first, it grows on you tremendously. And the other movements are dark and energetic. Then listen to anything Beethoven you can get your hands on! He's a good place to start <br>  <br>  (The dark second movement of his seventh symphony is especially beloved- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdfNTO_o-3k)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdfNTO_o-...</a><br>  <br>  If you like the barber, try these dark violin pieces (they're all famous): <br>  <br>  Mendelssohn's violin concerto- one of the greatest violin pieces, very passionate<br>  <br>  Another "adagio"- Adagio in G minor by Albinoni<br>  <br>  Tchaikovsky's violin concerto second movement- dark in a more haunting way, and the piece on my little introductory CD's that got me hooked :)<br>  <br>  As for dark piano- much of Chopin's stuff is a good bet; try the "funeral march" in his second sonata, his nocturne in C# minor and his Ballade in G minor (the song in "The Pianist")|`|64jTtN0jaa	Chopin's Ballade No. 1 starts off sad, then it's kinda happy, then it's kinda sad/angry.|`|Ybr4TwxKaa	beethovens 6th and 7th symphony are slightly like that they start ff either sad then get slightly happy and like really intense and greensleeves by mozart i believe is like that,also ode to joy is kinda like that too because it starts off slightly sad then gets really joyful.
KKKtKaMOaa	omg are you kidding.  what is the true real religion.  i can't believe you don't know it's roman catholic.  you should be ashamed of yourself|`|a28669642ec8a0b98ed527c49e493dbeaa	My belief is that if you believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins.

There are a couple things that are really helping me however. Try these:<br>  <br>  1. Buy a Rock Band USB Logitech microphone, as it picks up voice very well (remember to put it a few inches away from your mouth) and it is very inexpensive at around $10 used at GameStop.<br>  <br>  2. Get Audacity (a free recording program that lets you save your work as MP3 files, which is the sound format you can upload to the internet and burn to cds) from audacity.sourceforge.net and set up your mic as your default voice device in control panel.<br>  <br>  3. Get a myspace or facebook (if you dont have one) because you can post your own personal music player with your recordings on it, and this is a big step towards people noticing you. (We'll cover that a bit later)<br>  <br>  Before I continue, be sure that whenever you get the chance (like a school project requiring you to design a song or something), you take it. If you're good, you'll impress the class (like i did with my rap for Personal Choices class) and they'll tell their friends, who will tell their friends, etc, and youll become an instant hit. The next set of steps will explain how to get your recording on myspace, which is harder than it sounds...<br>  <br>  4. Go to fileden.com (once youve got your recording converted to an mp3, and upload it (once again, free account required). You will be given a url address for that recording (copy it).<br>  <br>  5. Go to www.myflashfetish.com/myspace-mp3players... and click "Create Now" where it says Mixpod.<br>  <br>  6. Click upload, then type in your name and your song name (separated by a hyphen) in the music title field, and paste the url in the music url field.<br>  <br>  7. Click add mp3s then press save (get code).<br>  <br>  8. Youll be asked to login, do so, then click on what site you want to embed the player to (if its not listed click the button that says any other website)<br>  <br>  9. Click post, then click continue.<br>  <br>  10. Login to the website, fill in a few other fields, and your done!<br>  <br>  11. You can do this whenever you want as many times as you want, It will replace the old one though. Now you have your recording on your page, so whenever someone sees your page, they'll hear you automatically.<br>  <br>  12. I am doing the same thing right now (im just not finished with my recording yet) but this is by far the best way to get discovered (for free). Please message me on myspace (My name is Linkin_Park_Rulez) if you have any problems with the websites or file transfers, or if you just want me to come check out your recordings. Good luck, man. :D|`|aT32JMQzaa	yes the built in computer mics suck majorly..get a condenser...try out for american idol, and in the mean time, look around your community for talent shows, open mic nights, and karaoke nights...most of them have cash prizes and alot of the time there are agents and stuff there looking to score new talent

I bet you have great songs, I personally wouldn't want to delete 2000 songs and start over.|`|sixm6Vlraa	Depends. If you have itunes you can still add album art.|`|oblndV4Saa	whatever idc|`|3bLNyHIgaa	no you should delete your music it's probably bad for your comp|`|DaUNt8d9aa	no way|`|WVMgUEeEaa	if you bought them dont start over<br>  if you limewired them make a list of the songs you want & then start over|`|IZSnzC6Paa	Yea you should, don't worry im a disorganized person too=)|`|54n7Y1UFaa	no. do it slowly. you will regret it if you delete it.|`|Rwhqgpbxaa	I couldn't live with that myself. Too anal.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I am so with you on this one!!   Give me Billy any day over the self-righteous Cane.  After he blasted Lily the other day at the coffee shop for not telling her the baby was Billy's.  First of all, she had just found out right before Chloe went into labor.  At the hospital she told Billy to do it or else she would.  Second of all, as she said, it was not her place.<br>  <br>  Then today he proposed to her!<br>  <br>  If I were Lily, I would tell him to get lost.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i used to like cane better but after the way he is reacting to chloe and billy's baby-wanting to take the baby away from them, i lost respect for him and i now i am liking billy better.|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	Easy, Billy, better looking too.|`|YIAVYlTYaa	Billy, even though he's a total player at least he tries to be good!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i say billy to he is so hot. and he does have a good nice side to him?|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Agree 100%<br>   I just started liking Cane ( a little ) until the baby was born and he turned into a complete maniac !!!<br>   Billy is a Abbott and Jack is his brother so what you see is what you get with him < There's no in between...you either love him or hate him and I've got to say I'm loving his cocky little attitude !|`|75zggy81aa	I think Cane is hotter than Billy but as characters go Cane is an annoying chump. Go Billy. And I love Chloe so I hope they tie the know SOON!|`|30r4coInaa	Billy. Cane thinks he's the best thing to ever happen to the planet, too bad he's as dumb as a bag of rocks.|`|1fNyFOLWaa	sorry everyone but i love the way cane talks and just like everyone else he will soon be a whole different person.|`|pyI0d8Lnaa	Oh it's Billy all the way for me. Cane I can not stomach not for a second.|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	I like both ...but at different times. Im really liking Billy with the baby|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Billy all the way Cane is so annoying|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I will say Billy. Cane is a jerk.|`|nlpPYkHkaa	I think Cane reminds me A LOT of a young Victor the way he is trying to control Chloe thru threats and intimidation.  I really like the direction they are going with Billy|`|AA10906922	Cane, I like his attitude, he kicks butt like a man unlike Billy who couldn't be a man if he wanted to be.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Well if you hate Cane because of his "holier than thou attitude", then you MUST also hate:<br>  Sharon, Nikki, Ashley, Jill, Victor, Victoria and Nick because they all act holier than thou.
7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	oh,no! you're not the only one! believe me! i cant stand him! he disgusts me! he always has to be the hero for the ''damsel in distress,''and he tries to make himself appear as a romantic savior.oh,please! not even! i think he's just a dissatisfied,unhappy womanizer who uses women.he used evangeline because he couldnt be with natalie.then once he did get to be with natalie,he didnt want her and he kept chasing after marty.now poor blair has become his latest victim.i'm just glad that she finally stood up to him,and told how she felt.personally,i dont think mcbain knows what he wants.long-term,i mean.short-term,i think he wants to get into bed with whoever he dates.but he dont care about commitment.i think he sees women as playthings,they're good for one thing,but not worth his time otherwise.i think he's just a selfish,vain,heartbreaking player like other guys out there are.[not all guys.just some]|`|l3k21kTmaa	your not alone i can't stand that man i think that he was going to play the new Todd he looks like the old Todd way back but as this character hes no good very boring .|`|7XM4QJiuaa	John has been treating Blair like crap but she also thinks that she owns John and I don't think they should be together.|`|xv7YlV29aa	to be honest ive not seen that show in months MISS it:(<br>  <br>  I always loved him. He is hot and a good actor and John is very nice|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	I don't care much for that actor. He seems to play the same personality and his expression is like he is smelling something awful.|`|AA10071149	He's so darn intense all the time. He needs to lighten up. I loved Michael Easton, though, when he was Caleb on Port Charles. Hot, hot, hot!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	No you're not he is so boring I always fast forward any scene he's in|`|EQP8VZwiaa	You're not alone.|`|pyI0d8Lnaa	Well as far as being sexy that's all he has going for him. I do not like his character at all though.|`|Qc3svDzNaa	He is playing a ROLE! Maybe the writer and director want him to be like that! It is great that his hair was cut tho - I like it better.|`|mrzbRd9Iaa	I always fast forward through his scenes. He is an arrogant, pompous self- righteous jerk who treats women like crap.|`|rFyikmTSaa	I use to like him but he just gets on my nerves any more.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Sorry, I like John. He can be a little intense at times, but I think he's an interesting and complex character.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I don't much care for him either.. His character has gotten so boring, in fact he acts like he's sleep walking most of the  time..|`|AA12390047	I like John.  Wish he'd get back with Natalie.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	He may be a little boring but that's ok by me, he is nice to look at!|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I LOVE John McBain, he is HOT and SEXY :o)|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	I have never liked him.
3NLThcMUaa	Fables<br>  The Killing Joke (I HIGHLY recommend it if you even have a bit of love for the Joker)<br>  The League of Extraordinary Gentleman<br>  Promethea<br>  Pride of Baghdad<br>  Identity Crisis<br>  Astro City|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Even if you don't like Batman you need to read Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns.  Both are by Frank Miller.   Gritty and dark-the way Batman is suppose to be.    Also, Neil Gaiman's Sandman series are very good.  He actually won the Hugo Award for those.|`|aKnoADs1aa	The spirit|`|6g3Z8NwVaa	One of THE BEST series out there is Y: the Last Man. Really, you have no idea. The series is over but it's all available in 10 volumes of trade paperbacks. It's not about superheroes but just the trials and tribulations of the last man on earth and the women who are trying to reman the world. It sounds like a dumb idea, I know, but the characters are so well fleshed out like Watchmen that it becomes so much more than that.|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	the league of extrodinary gentlemen is alan moore...<br>  also check out the sandman series by neil gaimen. theres ten graphic novels in it not including spin offs so its quiet a read to keep you entertained...and its amazing
kCUpmYrBaa	idk|`|jzbG6ZjQaa	Is it because your Mom says No?  <br>  <br>  All I can say is have her read this...<br>  <br>  I am a mother of 2 teenage kid's (boy & girl), and put few limitations on what they could watch. I didn't have to.  My kids are well-adjusted,Advanced placement school kids that are respectful and clearly know right from wrong.  Suggest watching it with your Mom, this way, you can discuss any parts that she feels like addressing or parts you'd like to talk about.<br>  <br>  If you are a well-adjusted kid, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to watch a movie like this...But, your Mom knows you better than any of us do!|`|9JCMVvFKaa	Changling is a really sad story but its perfectelly fine for a 13 year old. The Canadian rating was 14A and if you are an Amarican it is always rated higher|`|gxEBj6gcaa	if its a boy he needs to man up if its a girl then idk but mothers should let children watch rated R movies <br>  they should legalize that|`|nP4wNtZdaa	your mom is ******* uptight if you cant watch movies because they're vilent. or maybe my mind was just corrupted as a 13 year old.|`|ghISlqExaa	if you want to watch it..watch it and then decide if its appropriate or not!!! ....duh|`|I5VvAniXaa	no coz it contains naked people making love. don't watch it. ur Mom is probably trying to get off of it.|`|0lck17LEaa	yess... there is really nothing that bad.. its just a little scarry..|`|S9mk7tDKaa	Depends on your maturity, I guess.  It's a good film, but it's a bit disturbing at times.  There's some disturbing, and bloody violence against children and women.|`|d8b6ff7fe08936029ba4970cf94f93bcaa	There isn't any bad language and it isn't really scary.  There is one death scene.  Really though, a 13 year old would probably find it pretty boring.|`|0lnamekJaa	Do you mean "Changeling" with Angelina Joli?<br>  <br>  That isn't a sci-fi... That is about a woman who's son is kidnapped and the police "Find" a boy and say "here is your son" but it isn't really her son... It is just some other missing kid.. <br>  <br>  You might be bored by this film more then anything else... A compelling story though...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling_(film)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling_...</a><br>  Changeling is a 2008 American drama film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by J. Michael Straczynski. It begins in 1928 Los Angeles and is based on the true story of a woman who is reunited with her kidnapped son—only to realize he is an impostor. After confronting the city authorities, she is vilified as an unfit mother and branded delusional. The incident was related to the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, a kidnapping and murder case that was uncovered in 1928. Changeling deals with themes such as feminine disempowerment and corruption in political hierarchies. It was made by Imagine Entertainment and Malpaso Productions for Universal Pictures. Ron Howard was to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and Imagine partner Brian Grazer produced, alongside Malpaso's Robert Lorenz and Eastwood.<br>  <br>  Wait...

If you're watching it together with your mother, then you'll have her for support because it can be very difficult to understand some of the horror on your own.|`|xGf8q75Paa	Absolutely not.|`|ixOE0onnaa	no i would not say thats appropriate. that is not for teen, just for adults.|`|fex9rLltaa	psst i'd watch it,, unless you get scared easily???|`|BuUv7w8raa	who cares :D

SDRYr30caa	Modern popular music had it's beginnings in both the Mississippi delta blues as well as Tin Pan Alley with songs like "Heart & Soul."<br>  <br>  The former evolved into country blues and urban blues where Muddy Waters became a very influential figure.  The country sound also began appearing around this time but was called "rockabilly." Also at this time, gospel was emerging from black singers while singers tried to emulate their sound. Notable artists of this time period include Bill Haley, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Jimmie Rogers, Little Richard, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, and of course, Elvis.  They all began making rock a little edgier, sexier and taboo.  While Elvis really made rock & roll popular, it's debatable if he "invented" it as Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" & "Shake, Rattle & Roll" were both hits before Elvis and are arguably are under the broad genre of "rock". Actually, a song called "Rocket '88" by Ike Turner is often considered the FIRST rock and roll song.<br>  <br>  Then the doo-wop movement moved in.  One significant name is Phil Spector who produced many groups and introduced the idea of a "wall of sound" that was taken by the Beach Boys as well as many other future artists.<br>  The Beach Boys shaped modern popular music as much as the Beatles so you may wish to research and write about them.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you have the british blues revivalists such as Eric Clapton (and all of his groups), the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin as well as other bands from that era like the Who, the Kinks, the Doors, and Pink Floyd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan is a good one.<br>  <br>  If you want more modern artists (70s-today), there are the likes of the Clash, Metallica, AC/DC, Nirvana, Van Halen and Aerosmith.  On the pop side of things, there's Billy Joel, Madonna, and U2.|`|BXRZr5jaaa	Shwax pretty much nailed it, but i'm gonna pinpoint it to the Delta Blues master, Robert Johnson.<br>  <br>  "...Considered by some to be the "Grandfather of Rock 'n' Roll", his vocal phrasing, original songs, and guitar style have influenced a broad range of musicians, including Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Winter, Jeff Beck, Jack White and Eric Clapton, who called Johnson "the most important blues singer that ever lived". He was also ranked fifth in Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time..."<br>  <br>  He has an amazing history. Ever seen the movie Crossroads (Ralph Macchio...NOT Britney Spears) or heard the song Devil Went Down to Georgia? Both are related to his story. It's fascinating and well, a lot of it is kind of VooDoo heresay, but it would make for a heck of a paper.<br>  <br>  I actually found your question on here right after i maxed out my daily answering quota and made a new account just to give ya this info. whether you use him as your study or not, you owe it to yourself to read about him! :)|`|3v6edlJVaa	Elvis Presley- invented rock and roll|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Muddy Waters, he was one of the first to use electrical amplification on his guitar.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	You've gotten several good answers<br>  <br>  the one guy, that changed the whole music scene, more than anyone<br>  (and still does, by the way )<br>  is Bob Dylan<br>  <br>  whether you like his singing, is not material,<br>  his writing change everything, more than any other single person.<br>  <br>  He changed the NY local "folk scene", and made it a world wide scene,<br>  which brought on the Byrds, the whole folk/rock thing, <br>  which morphed into country rock...<br>  <br>  he was a huge influence to the Beatles (for more than just pot, lol)<br>  <br>  his songs have been "covered" over 25.000 thousand times,<br>  far more than any other artist.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dylancoveralbums.com/songs2.html" rel="nofollow">http://dylancoveralbums.com/songs2.html</a><br>  <br>  "All along the Watchtower" alone, was covered over a 1,000 times<br>  Jimi<br>  Allman Bros<br>  Grateful Dead<br>  Black Crowes<br>  Gov't Mule<br>  Richie Havens<br>  Jeff Healey<br>  Indigo Girls<br>  Phil Lesh<br>  Taj Mahal<br>  XTC<br>  John Mellencamp<br>  Warren Zevon<br>  Peral Jam<br>  Dave Mathews<br>  U2<br>  etc

The reasons being, because when it came out I was still like 13 at the time in 1993 when it fist came out and seeing it was just so unreal especially how real it all looked and at the time I think alot of people probably felt that way as well because let's face it I think we as humans had at least one time or another wonder what would really happen if dinosaurs where still alive today.|`|Az1L9qXwaa	Kung FU Panda- I know...its a kids Movie, but it was hilarious<br>  V for Vendetta<br>  Pineapple Express- I <3 James Franco<br>  Shrek<br>  RedEye<br>  Tomb Raider<br>  National Treasure<br>  Pursuit of Happyness|`|hko5xsH4aa	Amélie<br>  Under the Tuscan Sun.<br>  <br>  I saw Out of Africa last week...

Second would be Legends of the Fall.  This is probably one of the most complex movies in many regards, each character has a lot of depth to them.  Third is the Shaka Zulu series, I watched as a child and have loved it since, it takes a partially real story and delivers it with a sense of mysticism as to portray from the point of view of the tribe.  There are many more but these movies stand out the most for me.|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	300<br>  The Notebook (Seriously)<br>  Saving Private Ryan<br>  The Pursuit of Happyness<br>  P.S I Love You<br>  Braveheart<br>  Frickin Wall-E<br>  American Pie<br>  The Titanic<br>  The Passion of Christ<br>  <br>  These movies kick azs.

k3MIANAeaa	Alot of countires are really smart but some of them just dont show it<br>  <br>  In my opinion the two most intelligent countries in the world are Japan & Russia|`|mggll8dRaa	Great Educational Systems....!!|`|a4LWildhaa	Nothing to do with "smartest." The Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans MAKE their children buckle down and STUDY. They also have much longer school hours, more subjects and way longer school years. The only summer school in Japan is for advanced studies-not repeats as the liberals have dumbed down education in the USA.|`|d4e024d7b3f74eb1482c6eb0dc7c3e74aa	well im asian, and asian parents are very strict. <br>  and they are basically expected to achieve in<br>  education because that is very important. And that <br>  is also considered with non-asians too<br>  <br>  the reason why this is, is because back then our asian parents could not afford education, some still cannot afford it. <br>  so us children must rise up to that and achieve a better future than they did, for our good and for their good too.|`|g1hqC0zEaa	yeah, id ask that too. chinese and japanese r smr bcz they r brought up w/obedience and respect. <br>   <br>  <br>  i dont know much about germans, swedish or english or russians..asians r quite smrt.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	It's the Asian culture.|`|XZecjMyXaa	well it depends on the person, if he or she wants to study and have a great career when they grow up.|`|ac765fecf71e34144f9c20e6733b06d5aa	Asians, me being one, are very smart because of what they have experienced before, such as poverty resulted from not studying and doing well in school. Or sometimes not even having the chance. <br>  <br>  We get provoked when someone tries to interfere with our work, or take it away. Imagine all your work being tossed in the garbage can!<br>  <br>  We are very smart because we actually want to do something good with our lives... enjoy our lives in a huge mansion, etc. Only money via work via school grades will get you there. We also highly believe in respect and honor, something achieved through doing well in school. <br>  <br>  I've heard that Russians are very smart as well. I'm not quite sure about Germans, Swedish, and English.|`|77U2gV5daa	Not all Japanese people are smart.  A lot of them are though because of more strict customs than in other places.  <br>  A lot of Asian cultures put a lot of emphasis on education and doing well in school.|`|I4bALymyaa	I live in Japan. the Japanese are smart, but the Chinese will take over the world.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	Because they are raised to believe in educational goals and to do nails and toenails.

I feel like it is the kind of show that people who don't really watch scifi can watch and really like it breaks boundaries. Not only that but it talks about some the problems we have with eachother, religion, politics that are in the world.It puts a big emphasis on how we like to destroy ourselves because of our differences as well.

7gH7sgi6aa	False.  Suicide is selfish and very wrong.  It is a sin that may not be forgiven by God also.  Most people who "say" they are going to commit suicide in the first place are just crying out for help and even they don't realize it.  They want help, but don't know how to ask for it.  Suicide leaves behind too many hurt people with too many unanswered questions.

You did that either because you would like being held as a hero, because you will go to your Heaven, whatever that may be for you, or you wanted attention and you knew this would bring you positive attention. <br>  If you do something to try and prove me wrong, like hurt yourself, you did that for the satisfaction of disproving me.<br>  So there you go lol.|`|r5h7TmWJaa	People are crazy today. Especially in America. All you can do to help the problem is to not become one of those people yourself. The reason people are so greedy is because if they've ever needed anything, and other greedy people don't help them, they get so happy to have whatever it is, that greediness ensues. So don't pass the greediness bug on! :)|`|nDzenpkwaa	It's human nature to overcome others anyway possible.  Survival of the Fittest is real.<br>  <br>  If it isn't money for the people in capitalistic countries, then it is the amount of life stock you have or wives or children.  Greed can be measured in so many ways...|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	Cus people want,want,want.....|`|pfke6Jieaa	thats how people are in general. there isnt any person in the world who doesnt like money. eveyone wants it but some people would just do anything to get it or keep it.|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	only in America.|`|5AtyWKcVaa	Survival of the fittest.|`|AA10910187	haha wow sorry i am cunfused|`|pWoMaxwkaa	because people cant get enough<br>  right now is teh time when we need allot of money.|`|m0clHQGyaa	It's life|`|NVbeFgjTaa	They have a Greedy Gene.|`|yVX25938aa	people are greedy because it is human nature to be the alpha-person. notice i said person not "male". since there are a lot of women out there are are all about the money and if they don't have a minimum about of it they just don't know what to do. that's why those people should be striped of all their money and possessions and get shown how people who arent so greedy live.|`|R8YvSEdPaa	People usually are greedy for jeolousy since they dont have what other people have. Sometimes they are upset with life or they just don't like who they are talking to, you can never find the right answer.
y5txRe27aa	I used to, because this guy made me feel insecure about yourself. If you stuff your bra, it just shows yourself how insecure you are which is not a good thing. Big boobs shouldn't impress guys, real guys don't look at your boobs but your heart, and those guys are way better than the ones that care about your bra size.<br>  You're born with what you have, embrace it. :)|`|GiEinn85aa	Your dealing with low self esteem. Just show off your own chest wether you got boobs or not. You don't want to let your future husband find out that your boobs are fake when you have sex with him cus that is what they basically stare at when they do it...Not all men find big boobs or average boobs attractive. They'll be in total shock: "woah damn, this girl right here is FLAT when I thought she actually had breasts"|`|pfR5t4zkaa	I doubt you need to 'better' yourself in anyway, your just wanting to make yourself better in societies visions, they are just as many men who like smaller boobs as there is those who like large!<br>  You are most likely perfect as you are!<br>  <br>  Buy some chicken fillets instead, there not expensive...<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  We can swap?<br>  Mine get in the way too much!!|`|MU0EylAaaa	i am the same way and i am 14, if it bugs you that much just get a padded bra or just don't stuff at all, thats what i do, it just makes you look more fake|`|y3xCDNC0aa	No, I don't do that. I don't know what to do about your situations here, sorry! Just live with it, is all I can say.|`|6irpydIgaa	boob job??<br>  idk<br>  <br>  what if yr on a date and he surprises you and soaks you in water.. and you just like deflate? <br>  akwardddddddd|`|X4xdLXKaaa	1 word WATERBRA!|`|4EZis4lWaa	no man I'm a girl but my whole body looks like a boy's so if I stuffed my B-cup bra I'd look like a skinny guy with boobs lol|`|AA10771601	Get a good push up bra. don't stuff, you'll eventually be found out!|`|cdRDWS3baa	No. I need not to stuff my bras for I already have something to fill them.<br>  <br>  My boobs.|`|c4ESPPNlaa	Bras are good to stuff money in :)|`|uS1KAnCbaa	im not flat chested..|`|uWJnb1Y9aa	no i dont and wouldnt i think its unnatural|`|6Mlh2zAaaa	Nope, ive never done that|`|yD152y92aa	lol...my bra doesn't need stuffing.|`|YVNsRhAkaa	ha no...i usually try to flaten my breasts...idk i just hate them stickin out so much|`|X8VsIqxaaa	You could ask your mum to get you an ultimo bra, there really good at enhancing ur boobs! bit expensive tho! im all for tackling the issues u have inside about your appearance but i use these bras there a good confidence boost, maybe a cheaper option would be the "gel insert/ chicken fillets?" please also dont think u have to have large boobs to attract boys attention, concentrate on ur best parts, and ur confidence will attract attention! best wishes.x|`|5SqRzhDyaa	Any guys that I have asked said that they don't like it because it's like false advertisement LOL I am a thick girl (no im not huge) but I only wear a size b to a c and that sucks! You can get those fake boob things at Victoria's Secret. IDK how much they cost but I heard they look really real|`|GdUnVFaxaa	don't worry about it. I'm 18 108 pounds 5'2 and no chichis either A-cup :D Wear a push up bra or a rimmed bra. Though, I don't take being small as such a big issue as before, I think my size suites me as well as your size suits you.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise: push ups, rimmed bras, or water bras|`|K4UBu9neaa	stuffing is uncomfortable and if you ever get found out its going to feel so embarrassing!  also at 17 u might be dating and when a guy uncovers a stuffed bra, he usually feels cheated...|`|5sroXdhhaa	Nah, they're big enough as it is|`|IZSnzC6Paa	I'm glad i dont have that problem!!|`|Kbgc6x5raa	never have, never will, never needed to my boobs are big enough on their own|`|HKQ7wBtdaa	i've never done that.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Who cares about your chest? Only you. If you have identity crisis about the size of it, you have definite self-esteem problems. People who are not large on top look better in clothes anyway.(I don't know how tall you are, but if you are over 5'3" and 120, you are slim). You can better yourself by not being consumed about something that is not important. Believe it not, there is a chance you might be still developing, too. My daughter was 18 before she fully developed. They do have padded bras, too, so you do not have to stuff them, which I am sure must be uncomfortable. The padded bra does fill you out more.|`|EggNmoRvaa	I know it's uncomfortable, and on top of that It smashes your nipples,Hee Hee.  Dear don't worry about it cause you still have some growing to do and those boobs will grow also, Just be your natural self, people will love you just for being yourself.|`|bObtJCAVaa	Just get a push up bra if you feel so uncomfortable.|`|u3xDS7i8aa	i wear a bra?|`|qsuYKa3naa	only stuff your bra if it makes YOU feel good just be proud of who you are and stop thinking bout what any one else thinks<br>  its your body be proud & walk tall <br>  if you stuff your bra then you will think even less of your self once you have a bf & you will be afraid that he finds out so just be true to you|`|WpaQKpckaa	Don't stuff your bra. It looks so fake. There's more to a girl than boobs. I'm sure you have something else that's a little extra special. Accentuate that and be happy with who you are :)<br>  <br>  P.S. You can still grow.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	hahah no dont stuff your bra.<br>  <br>  id rather have your boobs then mine. im 16, 125 pounds and big boobs. its just uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  <br>  try a water bra!! their a bit pricey but worth it and last long|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	dont stuff your bra just get a padded bra hon!!!!|`|P284Snoyaa	u worry 2 much u maybe havent gone thru puberty just ask your mom how old she was when she hit puberty|`|YgDO6sxAaa	eat a little more. and no i don't stuff my bra because they're already big. not trying to brag really.|`|UlME0etLaa	Nooo I only did that when I didn't have any.|`|AA11738511	No, I don't need to.<br>  And why can't girls just be comfortable with what they have?
X45rxI7gaa	It's all true, she finally confessed!<br>  <br>  As for the death, I think Pain is just trying to demonstrate real pain to Naruto.....(so that's where he got the name from)<br>  <br>  But I really doubt he killed her, Pain's not the kind to kill a person who is no threat to him|`|PqX8a3draa	that not true at all she not even dead nor did she tell naruto bout her feeling i reading the manga as we speak that no where near true|`|CQX3TAIoaa	Yes, she did confess.<br>  As for her death, it's not explicitly shown. <br>  <br>  I don't think that she is dead. I'm a NaruHina fan fo sho, and it was such a great moment. *sigh* Naruto has been so good lately. It's amazing how wonderful it's been.<br>  <br>  I noticed your user name though. Haha. <br>  <br>  Btw, why are you watching the chapter? Just go read it! <br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com</a><br>  <br>  Yay for NaruHina!|`|AA11984835	Yes she's dead. Pain isn't the type of stab someone with Chakra blade, only to nick her a bit. She was knocked out code and stabbed to make sure she's dead. <br>  <br>  Her role is over anyway, since there were little chance of her and Naruto being together, thus this is a good exit for her.|`|5NfUPvsgaa	Yes, she did tell Naruto how she feels, and Pein SEEMS to have killed her... but she better not be dead, or Kishimoto can expect b1tch slapping.

Richland County (Butler) Ohio. The corner of these two roads is where Red climbed out of the back of the pickup truck. Several scenes were shot on that dairy farm, you can see the top of the silo unloader in a couple of shots. The stone wall was a constructed prop and I have no idea where it was? I drive through "Buxton" most everyday and the guy that owns it is a good friend of mine. Since the movie a modular home has been added making the total number of homes in "Buxton" Two<br>  <br>  The first link is an aerial view of that location.|`|oi6eHkPzaa	A flax field in Buxton county, underneath a piece of volcanic rock that has no earthly business in a Maine corn field.<br>  <br>  Best film ever, my friend.|`|kXxaUnSUaa	From IMDB:<br>  Malabar Farm State Park - 4050 Bromfield Road, Lucas, Ohio, USA<br>  <br>  This is the location where Red find the tree by the brick wall where he digs up the candy tin from under the rock.|`|hCcNwUTVaa	It's on a hill in/near McNary, Texas.  It's where Andy crossed the border to Mexico in the movie, and where Red goes to find that out-of-place stone in that rock wall to find the money and postcard you were just talking about.  I LOVE that movie.

OAKuDqXXaa	"Clash of the Titans" is pretty good.  "Jason and the Argonauts" is good too.  I recommend the older one, but the newer one is decent as well.  "The Odyssey" is a must see.  "Troy" is good, and I guarantee you that it is suitable for someone your age.  It is mostly R rated due to violence and blood, and some suggestive scenes.  There are nude people, but they are covered up, including Brad Pitt in his finest with nothing but a sheet covering his business.  Get your parents to get it from the library or rent it.<br>  <br>  There are also a boat load of Hercules movies.  Most of these are garbage.  Look for "Hercules" and "Hercules Unchained", both starring Steve Reeves.  The Disney animated version might be worth watching, but only after you have learned a bit so you know what is and isn't accurate to the mythology.<br>  <br>  There is a series called "The Storyteller" by Jim Henson, the Muppets guy.  While these are not exclusive to mythology, there are several myth stories that are done, and are fairly accurate and well done.  Good luck finding them though, unless you intend on buying them.<br>  <br>  If you are really interested, there are many books that you could read.  There are two that are exceptional.  The first is 'Mythology' by Edith Hamilton.  It is a very good collection of the myths.  You could also go almost straight to the source and read 'The Library of Greek Mythology' by Apollodorus.  Apollodorus was a Greek scholar who compiled Greek mythologies into one source.  You may also read Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.  There is a modern children's series of books that takes the Greek myths and puts a modern twist on them.  These are by Rick Riordan, and the series is called Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  They are entertaining, and while they take many liberties in adapting the myths to a modern environment, many of the details about the characters and monsters are accurate.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Clash of the Titans|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	The Odyssey<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118414/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118414/</a><br>  <br>  Jason and the Argonauts<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057197/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057197/</a><br>  <br>  Clash of the Titans<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/</a><br>  <br>  Troy and 300 are rated R, hehe :)

t6ZZMFeSaa	Water is something you will always want to have before a show and it is even better if it is warm water because it helps warm up your voice. Dont drink milk or anything creamy or chocolate and dont eat anything before the show just drink water.|`|Ew5fb4hQaa	WRONG!<br>  <br>  Don't eat or drink anything too cold or too hot. Everything should be warm or room tempurature. Have a spoonful of raw honey every morning and every night (believe it or not, a lot of singers do this). Chocolate milk is great, and cream is even better. When you swallow, try to avoid that "GULP" sound. It shouldn't make a sound. Try to avoid hard, crunchy things. <br>  <br>  - Samantha

NxBYuOzbaa	Okay, I would have to say Chad Michael Murray because Zac Efron is too young and I don't like Brad Pitt ever since he left Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie (Sorry, I'm a guilty Aniston Fan all the way).

vhy0k2dtaa	Since you live in Atlanta, you're practically surrounded by great places to sing. Try at a college or university. Try to get in touch with the jazz instructor. Tell him about your aspirations and ask him if you can either sing with his/her band or a band that may play the type of music you want to sing to. Most college instructors are happy to help you out, especially if they like your personality.
hJP9y6kjaa	If you aren't getting the sound now, then yeah, you'll need to get a better pedal or better amp. A better amp is the best way to get a better tone, in general - but since I have no idea what you're running, it's kinda hard to say exactly where to go with it all.<br>  <br>  I don't have any respect for Avenged Sevenfold and think they write crappy music, and I keep getting bored when I try to listen to their music (although the first one held my attention for a full two weeks before I got burnt out on it).... it seems like a pretty generic metal tone... get a Dual Rec, high output pickups, and supplement with some EQ and a booster/overdrive pedal as necessary.<br>  <br>  *shrug*<br>  <br>  They have a pretty wide range of gear that they use to get their tone - and it ain't cheap. To get a good metal tone you need good speakers, a decently high wattage amp (for the headroom) and either good high-gain distortion from the amp itself, or a good distortion pedal (ie Metal Zone, Metalcore, Metal Muff, whatever). Oh yeah, and high output pickups. Can't forget those. They use Invaders in the bridge of mahogany body guitars, but that's not the only way to go to get that sound...<br>  <br>  "Special strings"? Hunh. Never heard of 'em. I use Elixirs and DR Black Beauties.<br>  <br>  I also think they play in a much lower tuning, ie Drop C or some such. That plays a pretty big part in the sound of it all as well. Once you figure out how low they do go, make sure and setup/intonate your guitar properly for that tuning, so it doesn't buzz and sound out of tune.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia has a whole entry on their guitar rig + tone.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|RvnBuOROaa	<a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Boss-DS1-Distortion-Pedal?sku=151258" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a><br>  <br>  who says you need 100 dollars?<br>  <br>  and no.<br>  you could play it clean.<br>  or you could use amp distortion<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  also...<br>  <br>  why play their songs?  why not write your own?|`|FuFAfqcLaa	Put gain up on your amp if you do not want to get a pedal<br>  <br>  Could try borrowing a mates if its for a gig?<br>  <br>  You can get some really cheap distortion pedals now so it maybe worth shopping around to see the best deals you can get as it maybe useful in the future while learning other songs :)

yjSGVfdiaa	I miss Cale.<br>  <br>  Still a good song, but I prefer my Velvets to be early-era, noisy, and raucous.  <br>  Even when VU were grounded, they remained pretty outside everything else that was going on in rock at the time.  <br>  Bloody hell, they were a great band.|`|4n84kC4Caa	I think your musical taste is pretty damn similar to mine.<br>  <br>  The Murder Mystery is one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs.|`|ZxOtcYCvaa	i liked it. overwhelming glitter voices. unexpected heavy metal and meddles they medal on. the overturish amateur wasn't at all by my side. i clap my hands to it and my feet bled to it and my nose blew to it and my ears listened to it and my head swayed to it and it swayed to me. it was only a more version than i notice than before. i revue the vu as you do and do try to have clue next time. it was poignant and pointed my head. my finger points. my toes walk. my brain stops and pans. my mind bobs. like it's a mountain and a hill, though the valley is obscured by childish sorrow. sparrow. arrow. tomorrow. borrow the elsewhere. i would give this as a gift to anyone: the singing, the free verse and so on. no oxford commas for me; i do not like them at all, they make me feel odd and uptight. some would see this song as pretentious, but they were never pretentious. they were from the underbelly of nyc, prowling the streets for mischief and noise.<br>  <br>  we seem to write in a similar style. Hmmm...... *hint* *hint*
XctMTPisaa	Onyz had bigger hits, but MOP was more consistent.  All we got is us was a smash man.  I'm going with Onyx|`|F1SjcigGaa	Onix|`|r9Wx5ANfaa	M.O.P hands down|`|l72FO4eMaa	M.O.P.<br>  <br>  They're more consistant<br>  Have actual skills<br>  And you can understand them<br>  And didn't need to resort to side hustles to survive like corny acting roles|`|UX2dqQQVaa	I love both groups....but I will have to give this one to M.O.P.<br>  <br>  How About Some Hardcore??  Come on!  Billy Danze and Lil' Fame always come thru with the hard core rap.  I mean, Onyx comes thru with some really hard stuff too...BUT...overall, M.O.P. have better lyrics, a stronger mic presence, and more hip-hop hits.  Blood, Sweat, and Tears was a CRAZY record....one of my favorite of all time. <br>  <br>  Onyx's Shut Em Down CD was completely underrated.  If you haven't heard it, go get it.  You could put it in on track one and play it to the end without skipping. <br>  <br>  Sticky Fingaz is the best MC out of Onyx (better than Fredro Star and Sonsee....Big DS doesn't count as Onyx since he left before the 2nd album).  Lil' Fame and Billy Danze both outshine Sticky so in my opinion, M.O.P. beats Onyx in any arena.
VKPfIWyQaa	A tribe called quest definitely|`|G8eGWafVaa	EPMD<br>  <br>  no contest<br>  <br>  tribe called quest is alright but come on....<br>  EPMD were straight up handling mics on there records<br>  what was tribe called quest doing? being nerds???|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Tough to say because they are completely contrasting styles. ATCQ ushered in a new movement that fused jazz with an eccentric style of hip hop along with fellow Native Tongues members De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers. EPMD was the first hip hop act to employ extensive funk samples and fuse them with rock samples, creating an entirely new sound in hip hop. They influenced future artists like Redman, Das EFX, K Solo and Keith Murray.<br>  <br>  Impact - EPMD (they were more unique in sound and style)<br>  Consistent - ATCQ (a stronger discography over a longer period of time)<br>  Bigger name - ATCQ (anthems like Scenario and Award Tour help)|`|1lvyUwo7aa	A Tribe Called Quest effected me the most, but this is a close one. I think a tribe called quest does more influence though because everyonce in a while they will get played on the radio,but i have never heard a EPMD song. So while EPMD isn't influential directly any more, A tribe called quest still is.|`|xUxUwloPaa	This is most definitely NOT a good one. A Tribe Called Quest is the obvious winner here.<br>  <br>  BULLSHISH-KE-BOB! Let ME ask you a question, Mr. "Penquin"....if that IS your REAL NAME!....who are your top three rappers? Tell me now.<br>  V<br>  V<br>  V<br>  <br>  Cormega & (more specifically) MF DOOM both carry unique sounds. Cormega has a cool, calm flow while MF DOOM has a laid back jack flow. Both of these artists are more like EPMD than A Tribe Called Quest, making you GUILTY! (Guilty of what, Great Amazing Handsome Hip Hop Rent-A-Cop?) Guilty of bias! You like a laid back flow so of course you would think EPMD has had more of an impact. BUT i must say that musically A Tribe Called Quest has them beat. Check and mate. You gotta love this guy!|`|l72FO4eMaa	Good Question!<br>  <br>  EPMD<br>  <br>  They gave hip hop Erick Sermon, who in turn gave us people like Redman & Keith Murray. Plus Erick's production has gone a long way for hip hop.<br>  <br>  Some people need to re-think their answers<br>  <br>  HHRAC - WTH? Lol...It changes quite a bit, but I'd have to say MF Doom, Cormega, Biggie...why? What does that prove?<br>  <br>  Hahaha nice one, change your name to Hip Hop Rent A Psychiatrist. But the thing is, I did back up my answer with a reason for what I said, so it's not that bias.|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	EPMD was more consistent. Its really a toss up with who made a bigger name for hip hop.<br>  <br>  EPMD started the careers of Redman, Keith Murray, and K Solo.<br>  ATCQ helped usher in a more abstract, conscious type of rap music.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	tribe called quest ofcourse
xUxUwloPaa	Pete Rock is better, but Premo seems to be more popular with the younger crowd.|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	This a hard one. Both got some slammin beats, but I think, Preem got the edge. He's has some slammin headbangers. But you're right about not sleeping on Pete Rock. He's right up there with the best of them! <br>  <br>  Yeah Supa Star is my favorite Premier beat. That beat off the chain! Come Clean from Jeru's first joint has to be the sickest one he's made!|`|MSMem5qYaa	I like Premier a little bit more<br>  <br>  <br>  but my favorite producer right now is 9th Wonder|`|Mfixq1oyaa	Premier ppppppppp-premier|`|XctMTPisaa	Primo's the illest and I love the fact that he works with unestabished rappers the same as established ones.  Unlike Dre or Timbo
XJRYAhZVaa	Led Zeppelin:<br>  They changed their band name from The New Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  "All My Love" was written about Robert's son who died at a young age from a stomach infection. <br>  <br>  Three of their songs (Ramble On, The Battle Of Evermore, Misty Mountain Hop) have lyrics that involve "The Lord of the Rings" since they were fans of the book. <br>  <br>  Used a lot of Norse and Welsh mthyology in some songs.<br>  <br>  Jimmy's real name is James. He also wanted to grow up to do biological research and maybe find cancer according to him. I just find that one hilarious cause little did he know he was gonna be regarded as one of the best guitarist (if not thee best) ever around.<br>  <br>  John Bonham's nickname is Bonzo! RIP<br>  <br>  "Led Zeppelin IV" was originally just released with their four symbols because of certain critics saying that Led Zeppelin was overrated and to let the music "sell itself."|`|RFCcWPliaa	Instruments that members of the band can play include but are not limited to: accordion, guitar, keyboard, drums, bass and mandolin.<br>  Their two albums are completley different genres. The first being "theatrical rock" and the second being something which I can't really classify.<br>  One member has a dog named Hobo.<br>  One member can whistle and play along on guitar the Mario Bros theme song.<br>  <br>  Panic at the Disco!

Jd8IAhCYaa	Hello :) i have recently just started to sing as well<br>  If you look over the internet most people do suggest get a vocal coach, and to be quite honest they are right. If you imagine you start to self teach (i'm not saying this is wrong btw) and you think your doing ok, you could be hurting yourself without knowing or not doing right techniques etc.<br>  I would get a vocal coach look in yellow pages or on the internet for singing teachers in your area then they can help you become better. Make sure you enjoy them aswell or there is no point in going to them because you will look forward to the end of the lessons all the time. <br>  <br>  Also researching about singing (or anything for that matter) is really good for motivation and you can find out alot about it. Try youtube, google, any search engine.<br>  REMEMBER if your singing make sure you sing from your diaphram, if you go to any good singer they say most important thing in singing is breathing/singing from your diaphram.<br>  Look for youtube videos on how to breath from diaphram<br>  <br>  As for "I want to know some things about music" that is litterly covering over millions and millions of differnet things<br>  <br>  If your talking about a theoretical side of things this site helps to start off beginers:<br>  www.musictheory.net<br>  But to help you from a singing point of view with theory, To sing in "Key" (making your vocals fit in with the background music) you have to sing notes of a specific scale. <br>  For example Bonjovi - Always is in the key of E major<br>  so if you get a keyboard and played any of these notes whilst playing the song: E,F#,G#,A,B,C#,D#. (the sharps are the black notes) then they would sound fine because they are in that specified key.<br>  <br>  Theres so much to dwell on music theory but I don't want to confuse you. <br>  <br>  If you mean music from an industrial or historical point of view then research for historic is definatly in order and asking other people helps too<br>  and with music industry (getting a manager and making it up to the top etc) alot of it is down to experience, but research helps for this and also asking other people that are experienced<br>  <br>  Sorry i have wrote quite alot I hope this all helped, message me if you want to know more i'll be glad to explain! :)<br>  <br>   - Kingy|`|9OjelayMaa	Try out for your schools show choir to see if you can really sing.|`|11Vo2B2Paa	join your schools choir!<br>  get singing lessons<br>  if your not confident and cant sing in front of people, you will have to build confidence definitely.

12QJ9QMRaa	I absolutely LOVE Alicia Keyes, as she is one of the few Pop artists who actually writes her own stuff, and she has mad skills.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktUSIJEiOug" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktUSIJEiO...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-WZG-y2e9k&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-WZG-y2e...</a><br>  <br>  Also big fan of the Corrs.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBv5YjiEmqQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBv5YjiEm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fhf_rhhKCw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fhf_rhhK...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DulRaHmGYrs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DulRaHmGY...</a><br>  <br>  another group with immense talent, who write their own music, and also blend traditional Irish Elements with Pop music in a seamless blend.<br>  <br>  I would say I probably listen to Metal about 75% of the time, and after that, World Music, Jazz and Classical take up most of the rest of the time, so I would say that Pop might take up 5% of my listening time, which is no insult to the bands I like, but just an indication of the quantity of Pop artists I find talented versus the amount in other formats.<br>  <br>  Also, I would say Fleetwood Mac is largely a Pop band, at the end of the day (though Pre-1975 they were a great Blues Rock band), and I absolutely love Fleetwood Mac.  One of my favorite bands, of any genre, any era, period.<br>  <br>  I have also liked individual songs by TLC, Kelly Clarkson, and Sixpence, None the Richer, and I am sure others (like Sheryl Crow), but not enough to go and buy an album from them.<br>  <br>  As Satch says..talent is talent, no matter where it is found, and Punk, Metal, Indie or Underground certainly have not cornered the market on it.  I do think MOST of the groups that hit top 40 are formulaic junk, produced by the BubbleGum factories at the major labels, but to condemn a band jsut because they are Pop, I refuse to do.  <br>  <br>  For talent, I defintely would hold the 3 I mentioned against all comers.<br>  <br>  **Wow...some kinda close minded attitudes on here.  Not a shock I suppose, but always dissapointing. <br>  <br>  <br>  ***Free Your Mind...I agree, Old Mariah was not bad, though once she decided to try to get some "Street Cred" around 2000, it all went to crap.  And I was actually surprised a couple years ago to hear that Nick Lachay guy on the radio (singing about his breakup with JS I  guess) and thinking... hey this guy actually has some talent.  Generally speaking I hear JT or any thing like that and I want to tear my eardrums out.... but he was not bad.<br>  <br>  *****Hmmm... yep, ya got me pegged dude... I'm really working my buitt off to try to impress someone on the otherside of a computer terminal....... yeah........  pity I wasn't referring to you, since you actually added that caveat "it ain't your cup of tea", which is something I totally understand.<br>  <br>  No reason to get your nose out of joint.|`|5G4cRjA5aa	Pop artists I own albums of and listen to frequently:<br>  Lady GaGa<br>  Miley Cyrus<br>  Coldplay (would you count them as pop?)<br>  <br>  Pop artists I own albums of and sometimes listen to:<br>  Nelly Furtado<br>  Jack Johnson<br>  <br>  Pop artists I own albums of and haven't listened to in ages:<br>  Pussycat Dolls<br>  Kelly Clarkson<br>  <br>  Pop artists' albums I may get at some point:<br>  Taylor Swift<br>  <br>  Yes, you can severely beat me up for this.<br>  <br>  Good question btw.<br>  <br>  Mikhaela<br>  <br>  PS: So what if they're utter mass-produced garbage (hence the 4 tds)? They're a completely unsecret guilty pleasure. Hell, least I admit to them...give a girl a break.<br>  <br>  PPS: Rckets, it wasn't directed at you. Amen to the last five lines.|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I like Sarah McLachlan a lot, especially her stuff from the 90's.  I also still pull out my Backstreet Boys, Nsync, and Britney Spears albums every once in a while.  And I like older pop artists like Simon and Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, and even Barry Manilow.  Not my favorite genre, but there was a time when it was almost all I listened to.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	I love Mandy Moore, but really, only since she's moved into the singer/songwriter direction.   I sincerely feel that her last album, 'Wild Hope', didn't get the recognition it deserved because of her pop princess past.|`|WD9vYTTmaa	The closest thing I like to pop is Ne Yo and he's pretty distant...lol<br>  <br>  Even as a metal lover, I still enjoy some R&B and rap and stuff, but pop? honestly can't think of a single person...lol<br>  <br>  :)|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	There are many from so many different times.<br>  Michael Jackson ( Thriller is an amazing album)<br>  Prince ( Purple Rain)<br>  Madonna ( some of the newer techno stuff is cool to dance to)<br>  I agree with the female singers you mention, I love Mariah's ballads of course, her interpretation of " Without you" is unique. Celine has some amazing songs also, I enjoyed some BSB when my kids listened to them years ago..., pretty catchy songs, even Britney had some cool songs like Stronger, Oops, Hit me Baby 1 more time....my kids are just as eclectic as I.....we can be listening to Opeth right now, switch to Rammstein and a while later crank some Kool and The Gang and dance to Gloria Gaynor. And that is without mentioning the classical, Jazz, Trance, Opera.....<br>  <br>  so yes I love Pop a lot and enjoy it often. I don't mind saying it at all. There is very good pop around and some very bad one too....just like in all genres.<br>  <br>  here a pop song that I love<br>  ROACHFORD - Cuddly toy<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMZYlTXLqiA&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMZYlTXLq...</a>|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	None.  I can honestly say not a single one of them.  This will need only but a short explanation.  Close to 90% of the entire pop category is complete garbage, so that doesn't leave you with much to work with.  The only purpose the P of the R&P serves is for comedic fodder.  Of that amount, the remaining 10%, while talented, just isn't my cup of tea.  To admit to liking any of it would likely cause me to spontaneously combust into a pile of dust.<br>  <br>  If this viewpoint is considered "close-minded" I don't really care.  I'm not here to pretend to like something just for the mere benefit of impressing anyone.<br>  <br>  I see nothing but fair and honest answers here so I'm not exactly sure where these alleged "close-minded" answers can be originating from.  My nose is doing superb, thanks.  So just keep on preaching, brother.  And let the thumbs rain down!!|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	I love that paper planes song. I also have a demi lovato song somewhere in my library haha.<br>  <br>  but it depends on the definition of pop, i mean i like Feist and i consider her pop but a lot of people consider her alternative.|`|XO4talxxaa	I like P!nk, Jason Myraz, Justin Timberlake, Rihana, Jewel and i know everyone hates the AAR but i like Gives You Hell (here comes the td) lol|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Well I consider the Killers and some of The Strokes stuff pop, and I listen to those frequently.|`|ebxwADDcaa	closest thing i get to pop is Alphaville. <br>  <br>  and they arent even around anymore|`|4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	JT i guess and that one guy from that one singing show <br>  lol|`|jlKj1W6Haa	i can't think of any..|`|ef4fdcd84e60e1dac24728288eab23faaa	Hi, your going to think I'm extremely narrowminded, but I actually dont like any pop singers at all.<br>  I am open to different genres of music, but when it comes to pop, nothing about it remotely appeals to me at all. It sounds to me what metal would sound to others.<br>  Years ago though, and I mean when I was 10, 11 I had a major thing for New Kids On The Block.Does that count lol!<br>  <br>  So I get a thumbs down coz i dont like a particular genre of music, well excuse me, how about I lie to everyone and say I adore pop??|`|uUDNcsyUaa	Well being a long-time musician/songwriter I can appreciate talent no matter where it comes from or what genre it is.  As far POP singers that I actually enjoy and listen to..hmm, not much but I'd have to say<br>  <br>  Michael Jackson<br>  Mariah Carey (back in the day)<br>  Sheryl Crow (well, actually I just think she's smoking hot! haha)<br>  Boyz II Men<br>  En Vouge|`|8RkYlaQxaa	Does Jason Mraz count? He makes some good surf music I believe :)<br>  <br>  I also am a fan of Jack Johnson<br>  <br>  I listen to Jason and Jack mostly on the way to the beach or if I am in my hammock outside looking at the ocean.|`|shT2pfa6aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybjKY5q6lSE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybjKY5q6l...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKUthywEJYk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKUthywEJ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_lnUEFmhkk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_lnUEFmh...</a>|`|b68092e5a898db82700825e396642568aa	Carole King, Simon and Garfunkel, old style folk-pop.<br>  <br>  It's like macaroni and cheese for the SOUL.|`|fkkKROL4aa	I LIKE THE JONAS BROTHERS SOOO...|`|37qOjwDraa	Hey Peaches, I love the Corrs!|`|jdVxsK4yaa	the only pop singer i like is p!nk.<br>  thats it

Will end up being the PE teacher all the unpopular girls have a crush on. Curse his buffness. <br>  <br>  There is a few for the name Daniel.  I am sorry for it's length, but this is hilarious...<br>  <br>  This is a difficult name to define because it defies many boundaries of human perception, let alone various languages. One of the closest translations that experts give is God or many other variations of that general idea. <br>  Other definitions are thought to be: <br>  Tao <br>  Chi <br>  The Great Spirit <br>  Chuck Norris <br>  Energy <br>  Infinity <br>  Sublime <br>  ect <br>  Despite the fact that various names have been pinned to Daniel, its seems that all of the above examples (including that of God)cannot even withstand the magnitude of Daniel. <br>  The reason this name continues to elude even the brightest of human minds is that the idea of Daniel cannot possibly exist in a dimensional state. Daniel is so powerful, it defies all laws of this or any other universe. Recent studies have shown that people who have attempted to comprehend this name have either disappeared, died spontaneously, or driven themselves into a pertinent state of insanity and/or catatonia. One common belief is that Daniel is possibly the grounds on which everything and nothing is based. It seems to surpass the idea of infinity. Quantum physicists report that this Daniel is Everything and Nothing. It or He is said to have unexplainable connections with the String and Superstring Theories as Daniel resonates within every single layer of the multi-dimensional complex and yet still exists beyond that point which is where scientists have lost the trail. Various theologists and spiritual leaders believe that Daniel is one who is, as they say, "The Answer".

They had it taken and theirs was both sky high, in the danger zone. They said they had been taking coke and that was why. They were really suprised it was so high.

I leave for 20 seconds and this place turns into "Attack Of the Idiot N00bz From Hell".  =\<br>  <br>  <br>  Aight..... Serenity Torn Asunder......  I like the riffs a LOT.   Very nice.  The bassist is not very apparent, but not a big deal.  The vocals on this track can be decent, but when he goes for his real low notes, IMO it is not his best style.  The drumming is kinda average.  There are times I think "Wow". and then others where he gets pretty stock, you know?<br>  <br>  Butchery of the Soul.  OK... lets start with the bad first.  The vocals in this are pure unaldulterated crap.  I expect the guy to start in with the freaking pig squeals any moment.   Seriously, this is IMO, the worst style of growls, and IDK how the heck they got popular.<br>  <br>  And it is a shame too, since the drumming is better in this song, and I like the flat click the bassist is playing in the back ground, kinda gives a subtle ear candy to listen for.  The riffs are real good.<br>  <br>  <br>  So....off these two tracks, and the track "Repeat Offender" which I am listneing to now, I would say that these are a better then average, and actually pretty good Brutal Death band that really needs a different vocalist.   He really brings the rest of the sound down, IMO.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Brandon F..use a little deductive reasoning...he posted this 16 minutes ago, and it takes 3-4 before the question even shows on the mainpage.<br>  <br>  All the answers appeared like magic, approximately 1 minute after it showed up.  In  other words, they did not even have time to actually listen to even the first 30 seconds of a track, type and answer and post.<br>  <br>  Which means, they saw the words "Death Metal" and decided to share their 2 cents, without even giving it a chance.   <br>  <br>  THAT, sir is ignorance, as is your accusing someone of being so, without even attempting to gather the facts.|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Hey you!<br>  <br>  I really liked the first song...thanks for posting!<br>  I am just really picky about vocals and I personally wasn't a fan of the 2nd song, but, I will definitely give it a few more listens!<br>  <br>  Thanks!<br>  <br>  :)|`|ONWCXzUMaa	the music is great, I believe they would make good party songs, but the singer is not my cup of tea, that does not mean he's no good. Just there are people  you like this and that is great.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|tOoJL7sYaa	I like it. I mean I like it when the music has more content than that...like Dawn of tears or Between the buried and me. I also like Children of bodom. Not bad, not bad.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	The riff that starts at 1:48 is ****ing demented.<br>  <br>  Kickass solo.<br>  <br>  But....I don't like the vocalist's style of growling.....but that's just me.|`|MzeyUgR9aa	They're pretty good.=)<br>  Loved the second song.|`|37qOjwDraa	Just ignore those "mainstreamers".<br>  <br>  Nice band.

I will audition for them any time|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Meh, they're alright. Not something I would listen to every day. I like more melodic guitar and intelligible vocals (ie: Children of Bodom, Dimmu Borgir).  <br>  <br>  Also, you asked for peoples opinions, and they gave them. Not everyone is going to like this music. By you ignoring this simple fact, you have in fact become the ignorant person.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Eh. They're tolerable, but I don't like them. They need to work on the vocals. I can't even tell if there's lyrics or anything. It sounds like constant growls with no substance to them. Other than the vocals though, they need no work.

If you do this you're not only cheating the theatre out of money, but the people who made the movie as well. Technically you are stealing and your morals should tell you that stealing is wrong.|`|QmOmbprOaa	ever heard of double features? or hey I want my money`s worth .after all if you watch two movies you paid for two piuzzas and two sodas and two popcorns right? thank you. lightspeed|`|Bkr70KSSaa	i do it all teh time its called movie hopping, ive never just watched one movie before, just be smart about and plan out ur schedule and ur set!!!|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	Its called theatre hopping, its a victimless crime, just like regicide.|`|bS94GcOhaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!|`|EcNTOqpvaa	not really but if no one catches you go on ahead!!!!!!|`|HIn820Boaa	no it isn't

qDl5Gegbaa	1)Hot music playlist<br>  2)Have company over<br>  3)Hot outfit you want to wear<br>  4)Just do it<br>  <br>  First and foremost, get together a playlist you can't wait to listen to or of your favorite songs!<br>  When you wake up in the morning, keep your cd player close by and hit play when your alarm goes off. Not only will this wake you up with energy but will maybe want to motivate you to work out!<br>  <br>  CLEANING IS GREAT EXERCISE! Use that playlist! Wear highheels when you vacuum I've heard it's great for your bum muscles! ;)<br>  <br>  What are you hoping to clean...? Your room? Invite someone over to hang in your domain, I gurantee you will want it to look nice then, same with the rest of your house! Buy cleaning products you are excited to use like some good smelling ones!<br>  <br>  If you want to work out, go out and buy or go in your closet, and find a super cute outfit you feel slightly uncomfortable in. Eat dinner and meals in it at home...it will make you want to eat healthier and probably be more motivation to work out! Again, I would suggest buying something you are excited to use...like an exercise ball or weights or something new! Exercise video's are great too!<br>  <br>  Lastly, JUST DO IT! You can think and plan and blah blah but when it comes down to it, even after all that planning, it takes that extra step in you to just make yourself GET UP! WORKOUT and CLEAN!<br>  <br>  Other suggestions:<br>  Lay out your workout clothes in the morning or h e l l, I've even slept in mine!<br>  Go out and buy yummy organic fruits you are excited about to eat healthier to aid your desire to work out, it's soo self-satisfying you will probably become addicted<br>  Do relaxing things at night, even just being in bed an hour early journaling, reading, t.v., listening to music are great ways to get cozy...heck, go out and buy some new sheets! lol<br>  Get a buddy to work out with, not only great motivation to not bail but it makes you kind of competative at the same time.<br>  <br>  I'll add more if I think...otherwise if you want more sugg shoot me an e-mail!|`|A1s7BKd8aa	Okay, first things first.<br>  I use the same routine daily. It's healthy to wake up early, providing you get the recommended number of hours sleep, 8 or 9, preferably 10. Beauty sleep! :)<br>  I combine exercise and shower time by making shower time dance time! Having specifically created a play-list on my phone called 'shower time' (sad I know hehe) I take it into the bathroom with me every morning and dance as I shower for 40 minutes.<br>  And once I'm out the shower I do the same while I put oil or lotion on and clothe myself.<br>  Dancing is one of the healthiest forms of exercise, it's fun, it makes you feel good and by combining the two you save time and it's a more of an incentive to take a shower.<br>  This is copied and pasted directly from my routine;<br>  6:00 - Wake Up. (Having organized clothes and towel the night before) <br>  6:05 - After using the bathroom, enter shower. (Vigorous clean/shave/hair wash and 5 minute relaxation period).<br>  6:45am - Depart from shower, dry self with towel. <br>  6:50am - Moisturize body with lotion/baby oil and/or talcum powder. <br>  6:55am - Clothe self. <br>  7:00am - Sit down and do make-up.|`|zs38LPu4aa	well if you want those things I recommend you wake up earlier, clean more and get more exercise...that should be the first step to getting what you want.<br>  <br>  Get a Leopard, you won't sleep much with one of those roaming around your home and it will poop all over the place so you will be cleaning up after it and when it gets hungry it will try to eat you so running away from a hungry predator will accomplish the exercise part|`|AA10784260	Well wake up at 6 am or 8 at the latest and dust your house, vacuum, rinse down counter tops and shelves and shine up glass objects in your house if u have any<br>  that type of thing<br>  clean ur floors if u have flooring<br>  and exercise well jog, stretch, anything elliptical, crunches, lift weights, that sorta thing|`|1tlgYKROaa	i have to get up really early so i'm awake good by the time my day is scheduled to start. it helps me focus on my day better and as long as i get enough sleep it's good for me.shower daily and clean house a room a day.  the only exercises i do are my physical therapy exercises for my back.|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	- Buy an alarm clock, and set it early.<br>  - Buy cleaning stuff and have a specific day of the week to clean.<br>  - Get a bike, go for a walk, join a gym...<br>  <br>  People should apparently get a minumum of 7 hrs sleep.. so try & make sure you get that.<br>  <br>  :)|`|00788c9f2fa2a8a6f0ef6372120a0e3caa	what the **** you want me to do. Get off your @ss and make **** happen there buttercup...|`|dMS6uaxbaa	Work harder..done|`|YhuH2k4Caa	how about this for a schedule...<br>  "MOVE YOUR LAZY A** AROUND AND SEE WHERE THAT GETS YA!"  lol|`|3zG0HJxSaa	oo|`|50UbJp14aa	sleep early<br>  finish things on time and make a tietable of what to do<br>  go to the gym on sundays|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Well I set up my phone to go off every weekday at 5:50 am. So i can get up and exercises. I usually just go to On Demand or Verizon FIOS depending on what you have. They have really good work out thingys :) and I do 100 crunches every day. And I go to bed earlier around 10 or 10:30 so I can get a better sleep and feel refreshed. Maybe you should start cleaning little by little each day, set goals for yourself to have accomplished by the end of the day. I'm trying to eat healthier and become more focused, so far not so good but if you push yourself I'm sure you can do it!|`|hMMU02iuaa	Firstly, go to bed earlier (around 930-10). If you just can't fall asleep, try a glass of warm milk and if that just doesn't do it, try a non-perscription sleeping pill called Melatonin. It works wonders and you should only have to take it 4-5 days and your body's natural clock will be restored<br>  Instead of waiting till the mess is out of hand, clean little messes you see around the house. Like if you have 2 dishes in the sink, don't wait till it becomes 6, just clean those 2 and do that every day. <br>  Don't think of exercise as a burden, do it for fun. To help make it more fun, try listening to your mp3 player while exercising. Once you get started, you won't wanna stop belive me. You begin feeling great and once your body starts looking great, you'll be more motivated to do it.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Are you serious?  I love to sleep as long as possible. Luckily I work from home so I usually get up around 7.30am but go back to bed with a cup of tea once the kids are gone to school.  I leave the washing up until tomorrow and clean my windows twice a year. I do vacuum every day but only because of the dog hairs accumulating.  My exercise routine consists of walking my dogs about 2 miles a day, sometimes 200 metres if its raining. I'm fit enough running up and down stairs 30 times a day. <br>  <br>  Mind you I reckon I'm a lot older than you, I've done my early rising bit when my kids were tiny but cleaning, no never caught the bug.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Try getting an alarm clock. Then, clean in your extra new time! And, don't take the car/bus to work. Sprint. Then, on breaks, do pushup/situps to get the food!|`|87yovKYlaa	you gotta make a schedule as to what to do when and stick with it.|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Try waking up at different hours. When I get up after 10, I'm tired all day. When I get up at 6:30 (which I usually do), I'm exhausted all day. When I get up right around 7, I'm full of energy. Play around with getting up and getting to bed at different times.<br>  <br>  As for the cleaning and exercise, stop watching TV or whatever it is that you do instead. Tell yourself you have to clean and exercise first.<br>  <br>  Of course, cleaning is usually a workout. ;)|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	To wake up early u should go to sleep early.  Alarm clock or as in my case i just have a rooster lol, that works aswell suprisingly.<br>  <br>  To clean more u should avoid the "more" clean daily so that nothing accumulatates and if it ever does it wont b a big mess.  I have to clean daily bcuz i have animals in my room (not a farmer just an animal lover) I have 2 turtles, crickets (food), 7 fish, a hermit crab,and a chameleon. The rest of animals r outside.  Oh and i have  a lil chihuahua that finds her way in my room.  Focus more on what others can c when they enter ur house as to what specific things to clean.  <br>  <br>  To excersise more is to start off slow.  If u go right into doing alot of things then u will more likely get tired of doin them and stop excersing completely.  Take walks or jogs around ur neighborhood or depending on ur age u could always go to a park or something.  Ride a bike.  Do something that allows u to explore while excersing so u dont get bored.  Thats good for ur cardiovasuclar system.  Up it up a knotch by pwer walking with weights so u sweat more.  Reverse crunches are a good way to tone ur stomach and gludius maximus.  All u do is lay on the floor and instead of pullin ur chest up to ur legs u do the opposit and u raise ur legs up then go do (dont let ur feet touch floor for more resistance) Girls usually bend their knees to make it easier.  U dont need a lot of time doing excersises like that just about 10 mintues a day of differnt things and u should b good imo.  B creative u can always come up with new techniques.  Most important thing is to work at UR own pace and dont give up too easily cuz those who quit, well tahts lifes ultimate failure atleast through my eyes.  It will b hard and tough but nothin is impossible.  U can live a healthier organized life, oh and wake up early.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the rest of ur day:)|`|K0iFV73Gaa	ok here's the plan short and simple. You are waking up 1 hour earlier everyday and are going to run. Run for 45 mintues before you eat breakfast. At night in between tv like in commercials you will clean. In order to watch tv you must clean during commercials. As long as you do hat then you can keep watchin tv. Good luck hope this helps!|`|AA10253330	For exercising find a gym to go to and work out there. Exercising at a gym has helped me. It's up to you what time you want to go. As for cleaning, you just have to push yourself to do it. I am lazy when it comes to that. I would say waking up early would definitely benefit you. However, that's something I myself have trouble doing.|`|RmIeoU7raa	I try to clean the house when I come home from work and on the weekend afternoons.  I'm going to start going to the gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  I get up at 5:45 every morning except Sunday.  On Sundays I sleep in until 7:30.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man happy, healthy, and wise. Works for women too. Best start cleaning by getting rid of clutter. A good early morning walk is good exercise and good for your soul.|`|XBZS3oeTaa	sleep at 10 wake up at 7<br>  <br>  go out side for a jog in the morning<br>  <br>  come back shower<br>  <br>  go to work<br>  <br>  come home eat dinner and clean your home<br>  <br>  and next day start all over again|`|NnMzREtNaa	Good luck!

n5u3rkV4aa	i think it was trying to show that good things dont last forever; everything has to end sometime. That life and time work in unison....that because of time things change and later so much that no matter how hard you try you cant hold onto the past forever. And as it said at the end....some poeple were born to fight, to be an artists, to dance etc. Therefore i think it was trying to show that though life wont last forever and life's adventures all end at some point that the point of life is to be what you were born to be even if it doesnt last for long. =D|`|uKXgg9heaa	It really didn't have a point it just was a very entertaining movie.

8e8c3993d0193a64d5c270f4d370080baa	Well it tells you the answer is 30. <br>  <br>  Easiest way to figure it out is to number each small triangle so write the numbers 1 to 16 in the small triangles. <br>  You've already found 16 triangles using 1 small triangle each. <br>  Now see if you can join 4 small triangles (4 numbers) together to make slightly bigger triangles. <br>  Now see if you can join 9 small triangles (9 numbers) together to make bigger triangles again. <br>  And finally you have the biggest triangle (using all 16 small triangles) <br>  <br>  This should total 30 when you figure it all out. Hope this helps x|`|e0d9b534ed4fdc5c634234669f3d0d56aa	it is a triangle made up of smaller triangles, the question is asking you to count not only the number of small triangles, but the amount you can find besides those, so you count the largest then the rest of the smaller ones, and some that you find by looking at combinations of the small ones within the larger triangle.|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	it's about thirty but the quiz is a scam. I took one of those and they got one of there own answers wrong|`|2oEpCgmXaa	29|`|tvsfvWKKaa	it's 30... click any other answer and it will say 30|`|AnUwB7YBaa	its 30|`|hWxN5BfCaa	no - I only count 27

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	In Season 4, Mac starts receiving mysterious phone calls at exactly 3:33 am. Later on, he also realizes that the phone calls come from a number known only as 333. Everything ends up having to do with something in his past when he was a young boy. His friend's brother was beaten to death in front of him, and as he and his friend come to find out later, his friend's littlest brother witnessed the murder and holds Mac responsible for not saving his brother's life when Mac had the chance, making him the 333 stalker.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  If I remember correctly 333 was the number of the apartment or room the boy was beaten in.

It's a matter of opinion. I'm not going to try to please you. If you don't like them, then hey. That's you. You shouldn't like them because your friends do. Be your own self. I've liked them for many years now. But I'm not going to justify why I like them to you. People have different reasons for liking them. <br>  <br>  If you want to hate them. Hell. Hate them. Though you can't hate someone you haven't had the chance of personally knowing..no one is stopping you from voicing your opinion. <br>  <br>  Bee tee dubs.

They wouldn't last 5 minutes at a festival with out getting bottled off.<br>  6. People don't like them for the **** music, but because they think that they are "TOTALY HAWWWWWWWWT"<br>  7. Their fans all sound Exactly the same claiming they are all the jonas brother's soulmate, get real, it'll never happen.<br>  8. They won 2 NME awards, Worst Album and Worst Band of the year.<br>  9. They don't have a single male fan, real music is appreciated by both sexes<br>  10. They are, in a word, sh*t.

M1ymLE9Paa	I don't think she's a bad actress (although I did think she made weird facial expressions sometimes too).  But yes, I am having a hard time accepting she is Rebecca.  Partly b/c everytime anyone see's her, all they talk about his Emily.  We don't know anything real about this character at all except that she looks like our beloved Em, so it's hard not to think of her as Emily.  It was different when Claudia (old-Carly) came on the scene b/c Laura Wright was already playing Carly and the writers did everything they could to kind of distance the role of Claudia from Carly.  They need to do that w/Rebecca too, if they really want us to accept that she's not Emily.  Personally, I keep hoping she is Emily and that Helena kidnapped her or brainwashed her or something.|`|Owoo7e4Uaa	personally idc...if i had to chose i would prefer her as Emily because at the end of the day they are planning to pair her up again w/ Nick and liz/lucky/nick/becca will become the new quad(which is the old quad)...i just dont want her so much on the screen...as for the comment made before of sarah brown...at least sarah brown waited years to come back...and since not everyone watched yrs ago and since 3 other ppl(to wat i have seen) have played carly we have established that sarah brown is not carly rather claudia...|`|EhBF31evaa	I agree, I have never really liked Natalia as Emily.

f5705ff0a4dc130e92b935f3f3a73717aa	My personal opinion is that a strong woman like Oprah, a woman who's as famous or more famous than the couple involved, needed to get out there and speak her mind on this gruesome CRIME! Why? Because Rihanna has just sent the absolutely WORST message to all young women out there: it's OK for your boyfriend to hit you if you love him and if he's Chris Brown or if he takes ONE anger management class. That's just plain stupid on the part of the girl and despicable on the part of Chris Brown.<br>  <br>  And I ask people in the Chris Brown camp: Do we need any more details than the PICTURE of a battered Rihanna? I think not. <br>  <br>  Women need to unite and protect each other in any way possible. And the way Oprah found to help and protect Rihanna was to speak her mind. I applaud and respect Oprah for doing that. I only hope Rihanna listens... And if she doesn't, I hope Oprah's intervention will at least make other young women think about the fact that getting beaten by a man (or anyone) is NEVER okay.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	oprah needs to stop feeding the flames of the situation. she isnt making it better shes just making it worse. all she wants is another topic on her show to blab about. i liked her show better when she just talked about sandwiches.|`|pYm11JqYaa	The key words in your question are "intelligent comment".  Oprah is too busy getting spouting off her mouth about every other person's life, that she isn't bothering to look at her own.|`|SvzsXddUaa	What is her comment?|`|79Qtlxi9aa	I agree with Oprah completely. If a man hits you once he WILL hit you again. There is NEVER any excuse for domestic violence. I don't care how much money he makes, I don't care if she cheated, I dont' care if she violated his privacy. He shouldn't have hit her. Rihanna is embarassing women as a gender by going back to him and is setting us back decades by being SO weak.|`|v8V6aUPwaa	First of all, all you people trash talking Oprah are being ridiculous. Oprah was only trying to make a point. If a guy hits his woman and that woman stays with him, he's just gonna keep doing it. Since Rihanna's being stupid and gonna stay with him she felt like she needed to say something. What's so wrong with that?|`|ewAKksKWaa	i think that it really doesn't have much to do with Oprah but as usual when it comes to celebs everyone gets involved,<br>  i do think that Rhianna is stupid for getting back with him and i have no sympathy when it happens again|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	i think oprahis a selfish ***** and needs to go take all that money of her and get a trainer and loose wieght! i hate her. she needs to mind her own bissnessss!|`|21Db4VmLaa	I personally wouldn't listen to Oprah, she doesnt know what she's talking about half the time.|`|uqE7DNK2aa	Oprah is getting more annoying each day and should not comment unless she knows all the info|`|RUcBDdB0aa	well rihanna shuldnt stay with him oprah is right!|`|qOKFuXfLaa	he beat her a.s.s. there is no further explanation needed<br>  i dont care who started the fight, a man is much stronger than a woman. he should have slapped her instead- but not punch her|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	what did she say?

The Artist has a copyright on his music and it is not for public playing. If anyone wishes to hear the artists music, then they will have to buy the CD or pay a royalty to them. This is enforced by law. You tube had the choice of paying ￡10,000,000 in back royalties or Banning any further music videos.

0g2fDpUbaa	The ink blots are a "rorschach test."  They constantly change because the idea is that the blots are a fluid suspended in between 2 membranes so that they were constantly moving.  It also helps to keep even the shapes under the mask from being recognizable as a dark area's contours look a little different from a light area since people's minds are conditioned to see patterns in their vision (which is why the 2 faces or a vase optical illusion works, btw).|`|p7FzWvtSaa	Because when he was a child his parents stabbed him with ink pens and they are always changing to describs how hurt he was|`|23abbde9f1c71b312a8f4b3200894f03aa	Rorschach was abused by his {drunken, abusive} mother <br>  who never really wanted him and removed from his home<br>   at an early age of ten after tearing into two much older<br>   bullies that had made the mistake of tormenting him <br>  { they both had to be taken to the hospital for various injuries}<br>  <br>  He became  a sullen, and spiteful hermit with a vigilante<br>   taste for justice and an interest in being a tailor {among<br>   other things} and came upon a latex fabric that was <br>  devised by Dr. Manhatten that would constantly change<br>   patterns {by heat sensitive liquids embued into the cloth}<br>  <br>  When asked by another superhero to design an outfit<br>   with this fabric he became increasingly fascinated with it --- <br>   so when she refused his somewhat amatuerish design <br>  he took the fabric for his own and made it into a mask <br>  {everchanging to his emotional state}<br>  <br>  The design for the mask was specifically a reference to<br>   the Rorschach ink blot tests used by psychiatrists when<br>   asking patients what they interpret when looking at the<br>   ink blots on paper....<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_inkblot_test" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_i...</a><br>  <br>  Rorschach's name is also in reference to this same test.. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_(comics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_(...</a><br>  <br>  The character {his overall appearance and mask} is an<br>   homage to another character from the silver era of<br>   Charlton comics called the "Question" <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_(comics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_(c...</a><br>  <br>  "The Question" in turn was inspired by another golden<br>   age comic book character, the "Spirit" ...<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit</a><br>  <br>  **
AA12303060	There are many aspects to the great Tina Turner.<br>  <br>  During her days with Ike these were her inspirations:<br>  <br>  Voice wise, she wanted to sing rough, like the men did back in her day. During the recording of Fool in Love in 1960, the man who ran the studio she was singing at yelled at her because he though she was gonna break his microphone. Thats how loud and raw her voice was. <br>  <br>  Fashion wise, Ike renamed Tina (orig. Anna Mae) after a TV character named Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, who Ike loved. Ike wanted Tina and her backup dancers to be like the wild woman of his dreams. Thats is why Tina dressed in those skimpy outfits. Here is a link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/vcofell4/myweb7/sheena_queen_of_the_jungle_fiction_hous_14.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://members.shaw.ca/vcofell4/myweb7/s...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/Ike%20&%20Tina%20Turner.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark...</a><br>  <br>  Her hair was influenced by the loss of her own. She had a treatment done to her hair, which caused it to fall out.

Sometimes she sang the blues, soul, R&B or country. <br>  <br>  There is a story behind many songs that Tina performed. Far to many for me to post :)<br>  <br>  She has influenced so many singers. She influenced Janis Joplin, she taught Mick Jagger how to dance and Beyonce loves Tina to pieces.|`|4cd28a017c5daf9ffa389cca8eee2eefaa	Who inspired "T T"?  Her husband Ike Turner.

dBj2zVOdaa	To answer your last question first. From the first link below I found this - ABC and Warners TV continue to develop a reimagined version of V for a possible episodic TV series, with which Kenny is not involved. This does not affect Kenny's ongoing efforts to remake his original classic as a major motion picture. As for the DVDs, I think all sets are separate. The complete series probably refers to the original  1983 mini series. Wherever you see the set/s for sale, you need to check to see if they contain all of the following - V: The Original Miniseries (1983); V: The Final Battle (1984); V: The Series (1984-85) . Check the copyright dates quoted on the DVD sets. For example, if the so-called complete set has only a 1983 date, it does only contain the 1983 series. If it has 1983, 1984 and 1985 quoted, it probably contains all 3. The second link below will take you to the V Wiki site which links to all the series, etc.

They are definitely progressive and take a lot of influence from deathcore/metalcore.|`|uUDNcsyUaa	Adult Contemporary Progressive Death Metal<br>  <br>  I read that somewhere and thought it was a great fit!|`|9FclCgcbaa	Hardcore / Metal / Progressive|`|T52tbDtkaa	Progressive metalcore is easier just for a little genre category for people that are too lazy to actually give them their own genre. <br>  <br>  I would personally call the genre New Age Progressive Metal just because they incorporate different genres. Not only do they have the metal and progressive influence, but also jazz, hardcore, death, fusion, and dare I say it kinda screamo even though I don't like the genre lol.<br>  <br>  They just take all these genres and mash them up like mashed potatoes. Easy to eat and yummy to swallow.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I found out this about Eric's father:  In episode 710, "The Deluca Motel", it is discovered that he has been staying in a motel because someone is following him. They find out that his real father is from Cuba and is trying to kill him.<br>  <br>  And I know we've seen Calleigh's father on before because he came to her after hitting someone with his car while he was drinking.  He didn't know what he had hit - there was blood on his car and she found out it was human.  She told him to take another drink then (which he did from his flask).  This was so that any tests showing he was under the influence at the time of the accident would be inaccurate because she witnessed him taking a drink that morning.<br>  <br>  Anyway - I like Eric and Calleigh together and I love the show!|`|Sb93dIXbaa	I haven't heard anything about Eric and Kalie being related but weather they are or not I think CSI Miami is one of the best shows on television.|`|arjB50zBaa	No I have not heard that, although the episode on tonight is about a brother and sister who do not know that they are related and are in love.|`|f8Q8PM3uaa	love the show, love calleigh, like eric, but i havent heard anything about them being related.|`|SxaxLK02aa	For the love of God spell her name right!!

Its athletic, you move alot, you cheer and scream, you have fun! Guys say that its not a sport, but really, if they tried cheerleading, they would think its like soccer.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	yes i think it is a sport!<br>  it is very athletic, and yes gymnastics is hard and requires so much ahtletic ability.<br>  i'm not a cheerleader, i teach my self gymnastics for fun, so i know how hard it is, and cheerleading has a lot of gymnastics in it.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	It is a sport and is incredibly athletic.  I'm also a former gymnast and know how hard those moves are.<br>  <br>  But, I would rather be out on the field or courts, then cheering on the side-lines.  Just my opinion.|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	If it's competative, and athletic, and there are fans that pay to watch, and you can win or loose at it, then it's a sport.|`|wXV5GxJHaa	i'm not a cheerleader. but i know it takes a lot of skill. i definitely think it's a sport. some girls are just jealous so they've convinced people that its not.|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	it is<br>  people mix up their disrespect for the cheerleaders that stand out in a bad way with cheerleading itself.<br>  the good cheerleaders are there to sharpen and keep their skills, also for the love of the sport. it's too girly for my taste though.<br>  <br>  edit: im sure not many are jealous of you advicegirl?<br>  was that a pep statement?|`|SyyWIe14aa	Im not a cheerleader but i think cheerleading is one of the most extreme sports out there<br>  You have to be flexible and strong<br>  I bet football players couldnt gracefully throw themselves in the air without landing on their ***.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	cheerleading is as much a sport as kingdom hearts 2.|`|TmjatS28aa	Not really, you don't really score anything much......|`|GLK3LKDDaa	no it's not a sport!|`|yiEUOwK0aa	yeah, its a form of dancing/gymnastics.|`|4UAVrSkPaa	Yeah I Do|`|aHnjBlh6aa	nope it's not & I agree with the 1st answer.

WJW4qOlUaa	March 22   MARCH SWEEPS<br>  <br>  <br>  Susan's disturbed when she sees a violent picture drawn by one of the kids at school. Richard Burgi is back as Susan's first husband, Karl. John Rubenstein continues to recur as Principal Hobson.<br>  <br>  <br>  Orson wants Bree to sell her catering business. But the couple have bigger problems, as Orson's caught by someone when he continues to steal things.<br>  <br>  Dave brings his gun along as he, Katherine, and Mike go camping together, and James Denton has said that someone will be shot. Katherine's caught in unexpected circumstances. Meanwhile, back in Fairview, Edie continues to look into Dave's past, and she may learn the truth about her husband's secrets. Don't miss the end of the episode as Dave takes steps to keep Edie quiet! Edie's worst fears come true.<br>  <br>  Boundaries are crossed for Carlos and Gabrielle. Lesley Boone again appears as Lucy.<br>  <br>  Lynette's threatened by her new boss.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edie will find out about Dave and his path and he knows that she knows so he is going to try and kill her and she is suppose to run out of the house and get hit by a car.<br>  <br>   "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know"  April 19<br>  <br>  The women of Wisteria Lane take a road trip to  visit Edie's son Travers (Stephen Lunsford) at his school and tell him what happened to Edie. Edie continues to appear in this episode, but we suspect this is Nicollette Sheridan's last appearance of the season.<br>  <br>  <br>  In a flashback, Bree visits Orson at prison.<br>  <br>  In another flashback, Lynette and Edie go to a bar.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  May 17 (probably) MAY SWEEPS<br>  <br>  The mystery will wrap up.  We suspect it will be Neal McDonough's last episode as Dave; the show successfully rehabilitated Orson after he put Mike into a coma, but we doubt the show will attempt the same with Dave.
KyOP56Xsaa	lol, what about Aya Toujo? from ichigo100%<br>  <br>  Reserved and timid almost to a fault, Aya is the mystery girl with the strawberry panties that Manaka had been seeking out at the beginning of the series. . Regarded as a shy bookworm, Aya wasn't noticed throughout middle school because of the large glasses she wore and her unattractive hairstyle, despite her figure. This all turned around after she started wearing contact lenses and letting her hair down. A gifted writer, she won several prestigious awards for her novels and scripts. Aya played an important role in the Film Studies Club being the script writer as well as playing the heroine in their last film production. Both she and Manaka share the same dreams, to write and film respectively, that carry them throughout high school and it was out of this that she developed deep feelings for him. Because of her shyness she hides her feelings from Manaka throughout most of the series despite her being the object of his affection for most of the time. It was only during the filming of their last film and after the school festival that she was able to confess to Manaka. Unfortunately her feelings weren't returned due to Manaka's relationship with Nishino. Near the end of the manga, Aya was able to let go and move on. After graduation she became a successful novelist, having won numerous awards, and still cherishes the dream of one day, having Manaka to make her notebook novel into a movie.<br>  <br>  hope i helped! =]<br>  ~x~|`|LuAO4Ukxaa	OKAY SO THIS IS A WEIRD Q BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD FIGURE OUT IF YOUR A REAL PERSON WHO WANTS A REAL GIRLFRIEND OR IF YOUR A GUY WHO IS A CARTOON/CARTOON FREAK WHO WANTS A WEIRD FAKE GIRL FREIND GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT WHO U R|`|YyaKq8praa	Here why don't you find an accurate answer here?:<br>  <a href="http://www.quizilla.com/search" rel="nofollow">http://www.quizilla.com/search</a> (go in the search bar and type "who is your anime girlfriend", and results will pop up, and pick a quiz, and begin!<br>  Hope this Helps :D|`|XQMm3Ahraa	konata (out of Lucky STar) ( she's mine stay away)even though she isn't the brightest...haruhi fom suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu...yakumo from school rumble...and...winry from FMA

My friend sent me a really cute twilight valentines day card!|`|2LbPca5Caa	Wow. This i really sad.<br>  But to answer your question..<br>  You could get a picture, scan it onto your computer then print copies out.
srPCNzeeaa	It lets you escape reality and be memorize by the world that is completely different then yours. And since there is so many variety of anime and manga, it's a good way to expand your world. That is why i love anime and mangas.|`|Zyc93tcfaa	Anime pushes those buttons that Western World (North America, Europe, etc) cartoons don't dare to get near. The plots tend to be a breath of fresh air as well as the characters. Of course I still love those cartoons, but anime gives me something more. Mind-raping plots, graphic (and not just for the shock value) violence, unique views on issues and stories, stuff like that. Give a topic that would be thrown away by North American cartoon makers due to the fear of audience reaction, and Japan would make it into something awesome.|`|dlWr0ySWaa	99% of all anime/manga fans are addicted to either anime or manga, or both. I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I'm not either, but we really need to spend less time with our eyes glued to a TV/computer screen (-_- easier said than done).<br>  <br>  99% of all anime/manga fans will say anime or manga, or both, are better than American cartoons. 99% of people who are aware of the existence of anime and manga compare it to only American animation. American cartoons are seriously underrated by 100% of the anime and manga fanbase. I think anime is much better at drama, tragedy, horror, slice of life and other genres, but the only genre where I think anime has lost is comedy. These are three popular anime: Azumanga Daioh, Lucky Star, Pani Poni Dash!. What do they have in common? Absolutely everything. It's almost as if they were the same stories in disguise/with slight tweaks. Basically, anime fails at comedy. This is because many jokes are intended for Japanese audiences. Plus, the "random" factor has been played out. There has only been one time where I have laughed because of an anime.<br>  <br>  Artwork? If you're looking for something realistic, you realize American comics (and their animated adaptions) are much more realistic (and not to mention colored). If you like cuteness, anime wins. If you like the perfect mix of reality and fantasy like me, anime wins by a landslide. Yay for Ai Yazawa! (And boo characters with annoyingly big, weird and "sugar-y" eyes. *coughMatsuriHinoandArinaTanemuracough* Well, that's my opinion, deal with it.)<br>  <br>  Plots are better, yes. It's either stupid guys in tights saving the world or idiots being idiots with suckish or 3D art with American cartoons. This is one of the reasons I love anime and manga.<br>  <br>  Now I'm too tired to write anymore. Anywaaaay, the reason I wrote something so long is because lots of people say "teh plot, teh characters, teh artwork, everything is better ANIME RULES" without ever doing a good enough comparison of whatever they think anime is better than. There are exceptions, of course. When I did get addicted to an anime, I loved it simply because I had never seen such a pretty princess who could twirl like, yup, Sailor Moon. By the way, I watched it when I was 4 and my world completely crashed when Cartoon Network took it off the air. In the end, they left us with this crappy game that made no sense until they erased all traces of Sailor Moon on their website. Yeah, I remember that cuz I'm an anime and manga addict.|`|wdJS5MuUaa	I like anime because it lets me "escape the real world" if you would.Also it gives me an excuse to be able to stay on the computer longer.But over all it is just because it is assume!!!!!!!!|`|m6G5CuLVaa	It's addicting...

a1Ngi39Xaa	House is a great show.  As the other answerer suggested, you might also enjoy Bones.  It is very interesting and also has a touch of humor to it.  The characters play really well off each other.<br>  <br>  I really like Cold Case.  It's where they take a case that's unsolved and can be from many years ago and some new evidence comes to light so they reopen the case.  They show the characters now and how they would have looked and dressed at the time the crime was committed.  Sometimes they go way back to like the 1920's.  It's very interesting to see them come up with people to interview and put the pieces together.<br>  <br>  I'm a big CSI fan (all of them but especially CSI Miami).  I also like all the Law and Order series.|`|SxaxLK02aa	ER|`|xXDkTJcWaa	House MD is like my favorite show.

avqkU5n4aa	I believe school shouldnt be mandatory, although I would still go anyways.  There are obviously some people, many in fact, that just blatantly don't belong in school.  They flunk every year, they have no ambition to do anything, and all they do is create discipline problems and a bad environment for those that come there for an education.  If someone wants to drop out of college and work for minimum wage at McDonald's for the rest of their life, let them.  They should be in control of their own fate.  Also, not all of us can be educated with good careers that pay well, cause if we were, who would take out the trash?<br>  <br>    If school must be mandatory, it should be so to a much slighter extent, maybe only until 2nd grade or so so that people can at least learn the basics (such as to read) that they will need to communicate with the outside world.  Other than that, let people decide their own destiny.|`|rygoLKr2aa	School should be mandatory, but unimportant subjects should be taken out.<br>  <br>  AKA:<br>  Technology<br>  Art(Ok i like drawing Manga so i would go, but other then that it's worthless)<br>  Social Studies(My fav subject, but worthless -_-')<br>  Health(Screw it!)|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	but it should be...to keep me company!|`|ozmqdlEbaa	people who don't want to be there will take out their frustrations on the easiest targets. the faculty and the students, not to mention the property.|`|kA7GEKf7aa	School does not work out for everyone.

Don't you think that if you're going to speak it for life you might need to know who to use it the right way.<br>  <br>  Math - You will in your lifetime use math.

QPEtc0Qpaa	hey!<br>  thats really cool that you really want to go far.<br>  here's  my advice:<br>  -if there is a local theater around try joining it or auditioning for a part<br>  -join acting classes (where i live acting classes= getting noticed and becoming big!)<br>  -audition for every play at your school possible<br>  -go to camp where there is an acting program<br>  -find someone with a studio... or a friend!! my friend recently recorded her first cd! (shes not famous though) and i know someone with a recording studio<br>  -if u have a mac use garage band and record your voice<br>  -i think you will get an agent after u get recognized. because right now your still just a 13 year old talented girl=]<br>  -oh! make sure you take alot of dance classes!<br>  -when u take classes, join company! at my school, you have to audition for a speaking role (i got one!) so thats a good way people can see you shine<br>  -buy dance magazines, they have auditions for dance ANDDD speaking roles!! and im sure they would have one near lexington<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  and thanks for helping me with my question=]|`|8Hjynumfaa	websites like<br>  exploretalent.com<br>  talenthunter.com<br>  instantcast.com<br>  all good websites to get started, however 2 of these sites require ur credit card number......i think explore talent is the safest and most reliable

1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	I had hoped that Springer would have made his show more legitimate after "America's Got Talent".<br>  <br>  That has to the be funniest thing I read all day. The Jerry Springer show hasn't been on for almost 20 years because people don't like it. There is a formula to the show and even people who say they hate it, will stop on the channel and watch it for 5 minutes if people are fighting on stage.<br>  <br>  And no, there is not a fight on every show. The fighting is replaced by disgusting people flashing their boobs or revealing that they have some twisted fetish or they are a transexual to their families.<br>  <br>  The show is gross, but I won't lie. I watch it every once in a while just because it's stupid and requires only 1 braincell to watch.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	LOL The show isn't fake...but they encourage the fighting blah blah....because its what makes Jerry - Jerry.<br>  <br>  Like the other guy said - I only know this because of the behind the scenes show.|`|p7wz3pSNaa	Dont know......dont watch that white trailer TRASH...<br>  <br>  that shows for hillbillies and losers...|`|b6a987550f582ba088fcd9ab0f50f52aaa	Yes, it's usually about halfway/ two thirds of the way in.  I'm fairly certain it's all staged.|`|9GoiqfHxaa	The only episode I've actually seen without any physical fights in it, was aired 12 years ago, when they had a show where Jerry tried to get Ku Klux Klan members to quit their racist ways, and if i'm not mistaken the episode is on youtube if you want proof. Besides that, none of the episodes aired during the show's first three years had any fights in them either.<br>  <br>  While I agree with you that the show looks even more fake than in the old days, you can't deny that it's really funny to watch, even if it's not as good as it used to be. The fact that nowadays it's just a battle arena of all the trash in America, is what keeps it on the air.|`|acdb6a0cdafddde9d4235522d3642f17aa	hahaha because theyre funnnny :]|`|XFZmAMOAaa	It will stay the same as long as people like the drama.There was a show on HBO 6 months ago about behind the scenes.It showed how they picked the people most likely to fight and how these 2 guys would pump them up and egg them into getting mad.Interesting but sad that people would air their dirty laundry on TV.|`|a1pmr73vaa	lol..back in the day looked real now it looks all fake..agree..but I STILL watch it is fun!

vpYiYnSLaa	Voldemort, or Tom Riddle's, mother was a pure blood. She was a descendent from the pureblood family of Salazar Slytherin thus being his heir. Riddle never accepted his muggle father, especially since he abandoned him. If you read in the Chamber of Secrets when Harry meets Riddle in the chamber, he talks about how he doesn't want to keep the name (Riddle) from his muggle father and thus comes up with Voldemort and he calls Voldemort (himself) his "past, present and future" therefore somewhat, in a way "leaving behind" the name of Tom Riddle which comes from his father. Also in Deathly Hallows when Harry fights Voldemort, he sometimes called Voldemort Tom Riddle to purposely make him mad. This makes him mad because it's associating with his muggle father. So to sum it up, Voldemort is an heir to begin with and he shuns his muggle father and focuses on his pureblood side, his mother.|`|EzxeHsLHaa	pmm0928 almost got it, but there is one key thing everybody else forgot to mention.<br>  <br>  Tom Riddles father was a muggle, but his mother (Merope) was the direct heir of Salazar Slytherin.<br>  She loved the muggle (Tom Riddle Senior) so much that she went out of her way to be with him. He didn't like her though, but her brother noticed and didn't approve of her feelings. He hexed hives onto his face and Merope's only family, her brother and father were sent to prison.<br>  Now, being all by herself, Merope was able to get close enough to Tom Senior that she could offer him a drink - a love potion that made him fall in love with her. They got married and had a child, Tom Riddle. But pregnant Merope thought she was now on the save side and stopped giving him the love potion, which led to him leaving her.<br>  Soon after giving birth to Tom, she died.<br>  <br>  Voldemort blames his father for leaving his mother and therefore conceals where he is from. He only accepts the pure blood side of himself.<br>  He even goes back to the Riddle's house and kills his father and grandparents. Later, he uses his father's bones to come back to life.|`|DhII58USaa	Oh Hermi!<br>      Get your face out of the book and join the rest of us in this thing called LIFE!!|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	If you really are Hermione you should know!

UAHjJpC0aa	If you bought it locally, they should fix it for free....<br>  <br>  since you don't know for sure what the problem is,<br>  do NOT attempt the repair yourself.<br>  <br>  You may make it worse,<br>  and turn a simple inexpensive repair into a very costly one.<br>  It could be the neck truss rod, and it takes a trained eye to "know" for sure<br>  it could be the nut (not likely, but possible)<br>  if it's the fret, you have to know "how" to properly level the frets, and then have the "correct" tool to re-crown it.<br>  if you mess it up, you may have to have the fret replaced, and that could be expensive.<br>  it might be the bridge, <br>  it could be the neck joint, if it's a bolt on neck,<br>  <br>  It's much cheaper to have the expert do it right, the 1st time.<br>  <br>  and no, the amp should be affected|`|AA12137001	Check your local Yellow Pages for guitar shops or guitar repairs / guitar makers.<br>  <br>  A guitar is a very complex piece of equipment and doing the job yourself could seriously ruin your DV.<br>  <br>  Get a quote/estimate first and then decide whether to pay for it or live with it.|`|mKblsnHTaa	If fixing the truss rod doesn't work, then you need to take it to a guitar mechanic and he'll trim down the actual fret. DO NOT DO IT YOURSELF!|`|AA11594108	Did you buy it new? bring that back to the store.<br>  <br>  Try switching to a lighter gauge low E.|`|AA10262086	First off I don't know what the amp has to do with anything. The problem is with the guitar , right? Do not mess with the truss rod if you don't know what you're doing. The truss rod will affect all of the strings and probably has nothing to do with your problem. And whatever you do don't grind down the fret. That will cause you even more problems. Does the string buzz when you play the first fret or does it buzz against the first fret when you play it open? It could be that the nut slot is cut too deep for the low E string. If thats the case then a new nut would be the cure. A cheap and easy fix. You might also try raising the bridge just a little bit on the bass side and see if that helps. It's really too hard to tell what the problem is without actually seeing and playing the guitar. I can't believe they told you that it wasn't a big problem. Thats total BS! Was that the store where you got the guitar? If it is I would take it back there and demand that they get the problem fixed. They should stand behind their products no matter what. If that doesn't work then get ahold of the better business bureau and get them in on the act.

oK6yK1R9aa	It's probably the OVA, "Yotsunoha".<br>  Synopsis:<br>  "A story about the reunion of 4 childhood friends, Yuzuki, Matsuri, Nono and Makoto, in their deserted old school campus, Mochitsuki Academy. 3 years ago, they buried a time capsule under a tree inside the school and made a promise. A promise to meet again after exactly 3 years from that day. And the day of promise has finally arrived."<br>  _______________<br>  <br>  When some of the characters arrived, they found out their time capsule has been dug up and has a note in it, which is written by their old teacher.<br>  <br>  (here's the scene i'm describing:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAO75lcG4VA#t=5m59ss" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAO75lcG4...</a> )<br>  <br>  You can watch all of this OVA's episodes over here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAO75lcG4VA&feature=PlayList&p=8BA09131ECD29ACD&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAO75lcG4...</a>|`|P8gGMlbIaa	I think I've seen that.<br>  <br>  The teacher was trying to keep or get the capsule away from the students. I believe that happened in an episode of Mahoromatic. I though at first it might have been something else, but I'm very sure that's the one where they were digging holes all over the school looking for something. The teacher went looking for the capsule to find it before the students did.<br>  That would definitely be Mahoromatic.|`|YyaKq8praa	You probabally need more info. <br>  idk the anime, but here is a list of many, so you can possibly find it from here:<a href="http://onemanga.com/" rel="nofollow">http://onemanga.com/</a><br>  Hope this Helps<br>  :D <br>  ~Hunny Bridge~
xUKLUSL5aa	hell to the yea i am emotional. <br>  <br>  i keep my emotions too close to me my friends hate it when i get quite because then they know im upset. when i get emotional for some reason i always feel as if i more emotional than normal. i get jealous a lot and when i am hurt or sad i stay hurt or sad for ever. like i have to take drugs because of it. (prescribed) <br>  i dont tend to trust very easily because i have had a bad experience with someone breaking my trust. so life in general can be hard for me, let alone be emotional. <br>  if i cry i cry alone. in my room. and yes i can get ashamed of it. i guess because i dont like being vulnerable and insecure. <br>  <br>  yes i would cry if someone close to me died. if i was in public it would be those few silent tears, and then when i get home i would probably bawl my head out.<br>  <br>  edit: i would be so lost if i lost my child. they would be the world to me. i am very protective of my family and so yes i would be very upset if something were to happen my child...if i were to have any that is....|`|plBXp91Daa	Emotional yes weak no. I get emotional when someone who was close to me died.And no i don't feel ashamed of it. Sometimes i do tend to hide my emotions but that is if there is other reason when i feel emotional.|`|uel6NBOVaa	I do not consider emotional being weak at all, in fact, I consider those that are emotional to be the strongest ones. Without emotions, how would the passion to conquer all challenges appear? Without anger and sadness, we would not truly know happiness...and those that can express their emotions freely are the ones that are truly secure and have nothing to hide. <br>  <br>  Myself? Well, I am not very emotional when it comes to death. For me, death is just the beginning of the next path. It is not something that bothers me. I just lost two grandparents over the holiday break that were very close to me, but I didn't shed a tear because I knew they were at peace and no longer suffering from the stress of life. <br>  <br>  However...I am extremely emotional when it comes to matters of the heart. If I am hurt or feel uneasy, I can't even deliver a sentence without tearing up. I tend to cry when I'm angry with myself or frustrated with my environment, as I feel it is the best medicine. Letting out my emotions gives me a sense of release. <br>  <br>  Libra Sun, Cancer Moon|`|AA10197672	I am very emotional. I'll keep things inside and then when alone will cry if it hurt that bad. However if I am very hurt, I might get tears right then - this happened only with my man. He hurt me once really bad and tears started to come out as I was looking at his eyes with my sad face. He means the world to me, so I get very emotional around him. And yes, someone close to me dying of course I will cry!! I dont just cry for no reason, or infront of others. So yes to emotional NO to weak...|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm a Capricorn and there's nothing wrong with crying.  In fact, to me, it's a sign of strength, in a way. It takes a strong person to let their feelings out and admit that certain things are just out of their hands.  I've often wished that I could show sadness like other people do, but people of my sign tend to suppress their feelings.|`|9wSjCIsTaa	yes..|`|awLQeRkMaa	Yes I'm very emotional I feel everything around me sometimes I can feel peoples thoughts. I am very sensitive to what goes on around me. I use to cry all the time sometimes for no reason. Of course if someone died, and were close to me I would cry sometimes I cry when someone I don't know dies, or i see these starving children commericals. I'm not really ashamed of it I just have this shell around me (cancer) and I want people to think I'm tough, and I will be there for them, and if they see me crying they might not see me the same, <br>  now as I'm getting older (16) I cry in front of my best friends, and parents which I never did until 2 years ago. I also tell people my feelings.When i think of children dying, and being raped I cry.<br>  edit- whoops forgot to I think it makes you weak in the view of others yes In my eyes I things it makes us see a lot of the world some are missing.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	no one close to me has ever died . i'm sure i'd lose it.<br>  I am not emotionally weak in front of others. i havebeen told thati'm cold-hearted and some people joke about my callousness.<br>  those who truly know me know that im a real sweet person.<br>  In love i am very emotionally weak but i don't share this with the other person.<br>  that is what makes me cry . i cry for the person i am in love with . if they leave me i cry harder.<br>  and also i am a hardcore dog lover.<br>  losing a dog will make me cry as hard as being heartbroken. in fact its the same thing|`|VHxZuaOfaa	yea, you let something affect you to much, I'm not emotional i rarely show it unless it's about me then i will show it that may seem Im all about me but i'm not. My grandma died and i never cried my uncle to, stuff like that dosn't affect me because i come to know everyone dies it's what humans do.<br>  <br>  I'm a <br>  Aquarius sun<br>  Capricorn moon <br>  <br>  and that's the exact reason why|`|ak610Npjaa	i am emotional but i don't really show my emotions. i have to truly be in love with a person and them hurt me to make me cry other than that i dnt. simple things like people voicing their opinions about me and things like that dnt hurt me. i do cry when someone close to me dies but im not ashamed of it, everybody needs a good cry every now and then.<br>  <br>  im a taurus|`|7rrNvFK7aa	Being emotional is not a sign of weakness is it ?  If somebody died and I was close to them, I would cry.

ElFf1z5Saa	your sun sign is scorpio, therefore your most imposed qualities are that of a typical scorpio; intense, dominating, powerful, insecure, secretive, etc.<br>  scorpios are very powerful; you have two planets ruling your sign; mars, the planet of war, and pluto, planet of destruction. hence the reason why you guys are drawn towards negativity. i wouldn't doubt it of you are naturally drawn to tumultuous situations and/or people. scorpios have a hard time trusting people, and keep everyone at a safe distance until you know for yourself how close you want to keep them. once that process and decision has been made, the few people you know are worth keeping, you treat with an amazing amount of respect and love.you guys are very forgiving, but you never let anything go unnoticed... you never forget. you're very introverted creatures; scorpios are magnetic, people are drawn to them-- however, not in the way that the loud fire signs are; you guys can usually sit in a room full of people, very quiet, observing, and only open your mouths when you feel there's something worth talking about. it's a precaution for you, instinctively; by observing, you can tell what most people are like without even having a conversation with them firsthand. you're naturally intimidating, yet also magnetic, so it's hard for other people to feel comfortable to approach you.<br>  because libra is your rising, your insecurity levels may be a little more intense, or on the complete opposite, subtle. you can be a bit arrogant/vain, but you don't like it. the sagittarius makes you a little more social than most scorpios, but because it's in your mercury, it doesn't play a very big role. anxiety may be prone to you, however, you're very responsible and mainly organized.<br>  <br>  i can say that's a gist of it.|`|mKtGiuyZaa	annoying|`|jDnrmwEJaa	Mysterious, shy, evasive, emotional.

Wearing a grey tailcoat, gracefully brewing the worlds strongest red tea, please watch to see how such a perfect butler copes with such a master...<br>  <br>  Mushi-Shi:<br>  - They are neither plants nor animals. They differ from other forms of life such as the micro-organisms and the fungi. Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as "Mushi". Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a "Mushi-shi" who travels around to investigate and find out more about the "Mushi". In the process, he also lends a helping hand to people who face problems with supernatural occurances which may be related to the "Mushi".<br>  <br>  Rental Magica:<br>  - Due to his father's disappearance, Itsuki Iba has to take over the family business: a magician dispatch service called 'Astral'. Astral basically employ countless magicians and other supernatural beings in order to send them out to help those who need magical assistance. As a leader, Itsuki now has to be tough, commanding, and reliable, but there's one problem, he's a coward. Also, in order to run a successful business, he has to connect with his employees, which is more difficult than it seems due to his personality and lack of magical ability. But not only does he have to deal with his own employees, he also has to deal with those who threaten the family business.<br>  <br>  Natsume Yuujinchou:<br>  - Natsume Takashi has the ability to see spirits, which he has long kept secret. However, once he inherits a strange book that belonged to his deceased grandmother, Reiko, he discovers the reason why spirits surround him. Containing the names of these spirits, a binding contract was formed between the spirits and the owner of the book. Now, Natsume is determined to free the spirits and dissolve the contracts. With the help of a spirit cat, his days are filled trying to return the names to these spirits.|`|KubD1fBLaa	Manga<br>  -Special A<br>  -Penguin Revolution<br>  -Angel Diary<br>  -Venus Capriccio<br>  -Hana-Kimi<br>  ..some of my favorites...(^_^)...|`|AKnZMOQ5aa	Ouran High School Host Club<br>  Mobile Suit Gundam 00<br>  One Piece<br>  School Rumble<br>  Katekyo Hitman Reborn<br>  Kuroshitsuji <<<---[definitely this one]|`|mUchRkoCaa	One Piece.

They have a great online tool where you can set your "must play" and "do not play" and all that good stuff.  They are really attentive and helpful.  Tried to up sell us on a lot at first - we only agreed to extra speakers for our extra room, and they ultimately gave us a huge discount on lights (because they said it makes it better and they wanted it to be fun) and gave us a pager for free (to page our DJ for anything we needed at all during the reception).  We really liked them and still get lots of compliments on what a good job they did.

62448526b9217dfdf52b5f199ef340a9aa	I was with a band that charted two songs nationally in the 60's, one made it to # 2, so here goes my opinion.<br>  <br>  You have a unique style, your voice has promise but needs work, forget the guitar and work on your voice, don't try to sing songs that are to big for you right now, try songs that are within your range and that you feel comfortable with, then progress slowly to songs that test you.There are millions of people who can sing, what sets successful singers apart from them is their uniqueness. Don't try to sound like someone else, be yourself.

EXIjMTVcaa	well it's kinda hard to find a song without any words... if what you mean is you just want the instruments to form a song. Look up online music sites, sometimes they offer a "revised" edition of the music, where you could buy only the instrument piece of the song. If this is what you mean then I know how you feel because I too sometimes feel like just listening to nice peaceful music... preferrably because of the cool, smooth drums that are played!<br>  BOB MARLEY, NEVER FORGOTTEN|`|SAaEiqHvaa	not sure about any that has no words, but u might like these...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9TJ9K6I9Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9TJ9K6I...</a><br>  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqGBHEnVNEI<br>  <br>  enjoy..|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	"I Do Not Sniff The Coke, I Only Smoke The Sinsemilla", by Pato Banton.|`|tE3OKcZ9aa	What kind of song? My favorite at the moment is "Don't You Know" by Isasha, but that's because it makes me think of my relationship with my fiance.

Your head voice is a little lighter...sometimes airy...<br>  <br>  The terms head and chest refer to where the sound is vibrating. When you use your head voice (usually sopranos), voice teachers want you to position your voice so that it vibrates in your head (like as if the sound were shooting through your forehead or right under your eyes near your cheekbones). Your chest voice..resonates more from your chest...<br>  <br>  As you sing higher, if you're using your chest voice, your throat typically starts to hurt, because you're straining your chords, whereas you can sing high in your head voice and you'll be fine.|`|SlSayKllaa	because out of your chest you can feel it in your gut,you throat and sometimes chest.head singing makes your head hurt right then or later on

AA10903291	very, very cold, and with no maternal instinct, did you see it when the surrogates children wanted to kiss the baby good bye and she freaked out, what is her problem eh?|`|jkvELDIFaa	I did't like her at all not very maternal, if I was her surragate I would be worried for Edward, as for her "husband" I think he was just as useless and a" doormat."|`|AA10077992	I was getting worried for poor Edward from when she put him in the pushchair ! I don't think she will be able to cope very well - odd woman|`|JZt4Yu76aa	Didn't like her. She didn't seem to have one maternal bone in her. <br>  <br>  Saying that though I didn't really like the other woman either. <br>  <br>  Both the husbands seemed very under the thumb, you know, the "I'll just stand in the corner and keep quiet" type. May have got told off otherwise.|`|FjFAEvzcaa	She wasn't all there in the head - didn't have a clue when it came to children and then they get an equally as nutty person to give her a baby. What the hell is this world coming to?|`|MojYmo5Jaa	I think because she has had no experience with children, this is why she could not relate to the surrogate mother's children. I think this will come in time when she brings up edward.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think she has a problem.
HL3cm1yGaa	I would love to help a couple achieve a quarter of what  I have achieved, 4 beautiful children!<br>  But deep down, I do not think I could do it.........once I felt that first kick, I was bonded with that unborn child and could not wait to give birth and kiss that baby!<br>  <br>  It's like giving blood, I so want to do it, but I have a fear of needles and each time I give a blood sample, I feel faint!<br>  <br>  Must be one of two things I sooooooooo wanna do but know I could not!<br>  Coward as I am!|`|DtU1EpoVaa	depends who for my sister yes and close friend yes but someone I didn't know no I could as I would not know for sure they if they would be great parents not saying everyone that has kids are but if am going to bring a child into the world for someone I would need to know for sure they are going to love it and give it the best life they can and I would need to trust them 100% that's why I would only do it for someone am close too.<br>  <br>  I can see what you mean about it not being your eggs but I think even if I had carried the baby for 9 months and its not biologically mine I would still need to be sure the I could trust them|`|EFZRSqFcaa	Yes I would be a surrogate but like you not with my own egg.<br>  <br>  I sailed through my pregnancy but do NOT want anymore children but I would happily help someone else have a child, mind you I'm getting a bit long in the tooth now!  lol|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	I also considered carrying a child for my sister.

But I'd bloody well do it for a friend or my sister. <br>  <br>  The hardest thing would be giving the baby up but I'd just have to get it into my head that it was the other womans baby and she'd have to take the baby away as soon as its born. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't hesitate to say yes to any of my close friends- respectable people who I trust!|`|FjFAEvzcaa	After giving birth to two children, I don't understand how any woman with any kind of maternal instincts can give a baby away.

Gm0FHqTWaa	I shave mine, married with two kids.  I work in a factory that is really hot and it helps me deal with the heat.  My wife likes the way they feel.  No one has ever given me a bad time about it.  I've always had real wiry hair on my legs that pulled while wearing pants.  I never thought about it until I lost a bet and the loser had to shave his legs and pretty much done it ever since.   You're right, a guy doesn't have to be gay to shave his legs, there can be other circumstances for the leg shaving.  I also disagree with it being okay for one sports athlete and not okay for another, it shouldn't matter if he is a runner or a bowler.  Bottom line is it's really a personal preference and a person should do it if he wants to.  Quite frankly they are my legs and I'll do what I want with them and don't care what others think.|`|uV54p794aa	I don't like when guys shave their legs, that's a bit much, unless they are body builders..They shave their entire body, but that's ok.( shows off the muscles more :). But for the guys that do shave their legs, could you please talk to the guys that NEED to shave their backs??? That is gross, having a hairy back.. eeewww|`|al4ptXmWaa	I dated a guy from Puerto Rico and he shaved his legs regularly because most guys from there do it's just their culture. It's up to you if it makes you feel more comfortable then do it.|`|fGbVbDJcaa	i find it hot.<br>  i don't like body hair, but that's a personal preference.<br>  <br>  and just cause a guy shaves his legs doesn't mean he's not manly. plus it's a turn off when guys try to be all tough and macho and shyt.|`|kOGpmqcnaa	HAHA that would be very interesting|`|0USM8JG1aa	Why the hell would a man shave his legs?|`|D6L2KCbMaa	I Tried it for footy but it took like an hour and i'll probley wont do it again.

0qN0eUbUaa	well the thing about the whole wannabe batman is its distributed by dc comics and was written as a parody of the character in some ways...no aquaman to be found however.....<br>  i thought it was good its very loyal to the original material in most ways but the ending was changed heavily. worth the money to go see it? definatly|`|eBIkTdZ6aa	um, this movie is based on a graphic novel so no there is no "wanna-be" anything. Allen Moore, the author, wrote this in a mockery of sorts of superhero's. That phrase is ignorant and obviously stated by someone who hasn't read the graphic novel. The sex scenes were sex scenes. they weren't unnecessary because they were exactly how they are in the novel. Don't listen to ignorant people who haven't read the novel and go and say it's pointless and wanna-be. It's the most original story based on superheros i've ever read or seen.|`|VbjwxaB4aa	lol theres not lots of sex scenes theres just one  sex scene which was a bit longer than comfortable, with a stupid song to it. im guessing the wanna be batman is night owl, the costumes similar but the watchmen is a reallly old comic so its pretty original.<br>  alot of people didnt like it cos its not full of action and fighting its more of a deep film, its well written tho the script reminds me of sin city. its worth seeing anyway, then see what you make of it.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Not at all..

One day he finds the "Death Note": a notebook from the realm of the Death Gods, with the power to kill people in any way he desires. With the Death Note in hand, Light decides to create his perfect world, without crime or criminals. However, when criminals start dropping dead one by one, the authorites send the legendary detective L to track down the killer, and a battle of wits, deception and logic ensues<br>  ----great anime, my second favorite.

Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.<br>  -----this anime is a lot better than it sounds. I originally didn't want to watch it and put it off several times.

Due to this dangerous power, they have been captured and isolated in laboratories by the government. Lucy, a young and psychotic Diclonius, manages to break free of her confines and brutally murder most of the guards in the laboratory, only to get shot in the head as she makes her escape. She survives and manages to drift along to a beach, where two teenagers named Kouta and Yuka discovers her. Having lost her memories, she was named after the only thing that she can now say, "Nyuu," and the two allow her to stay at Kouta's home. However, it appears that the evil "Lucy" is not dead just yet... <br>  -----very good series, a lot of nudityt/ blood in the first two eps, but after that theres no nudity and not a lot of blood<br>  <br>  School Days<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/2476/School_Days" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/2476/School...</a><br>  A shy and unconfident teenager has become very accepting at only stealing glances at a cute girl as they ride the same trolley each morning on their way to their high school. At least until Saionji Sekai surprises Itou Makoto and chances to get a peek at a photo-snap of the beautiful Katsura on his cell-phone. After evilly teasing Mokoto about his forlorn crush, Sekai offers to support him in his romance. So after many Makoto-pep-talks and lots of scheming, the three become close friends. Close enough that Makoto braves asking Katsura out on date. And she agrees. Later that day, Makoto finds a quiet moment express his thanks for all support that Sekai has offered him, and makes clear his intent on finding away to reply her kindness. But he is totally unprepared and very surprised at the reward that Sekai has chosen. Sekai steals a long kiss from his lips, before breaking away to run for the trolly. Sekai turns and wishes Makoto well on his date.<br>  -------good if you like romances/Psychological/ love triangle.

Ten or so years later, serial killings plague Germany, and the good doctor goes on a quest to remedy his mistake.  WARNING:  A little more mature in plot.|`|efx1CpFVaa	Trinity Blood: The story takes place in the future after the Armageddon.  It's like a combination of the past/future and center around Rome Italy and Father Abel Nightroad.  The main character is often broke, clumsy, and hilarious.  The story focuses on the Vatican and the Catholics, but I wouldn't consider a big religious anime or anything.  Anyway, vampires exist in this future and there's some great dislike between them and humans.  The main character is a crusnik, a vampire who sucks the blood of other vampires.  The biggest threat to the Vatican is an organization called Contra Mundi, (which means against the world), who plan on creating a whole new world.<br>  <br>  Highly recommend it.<br>  I would recommend you more but I'm lazy and my hand is cramping from extended typing :D|`|LcSwDbr4aa	Full Metal Panic:  About a secret para-military organization; Mithril, who protect the world from evil organizations hunting special young girls with superior mental abilities able to unlock the secrets of overdeveloped technology for military mechas.<br>  <br>  Moribito:  A spear weilding bodyguard, is hired to protect the life of a prince who is possessed by a water demon and whose father is trying to kill him (in order to save his kingdom).

The series is about the struggle between the Exorcists and the Millennium Earl, but there's a lot else going on as well.<br>  <br>  Kekkaishi: Kind of a mix of Bleach and Inuyasha. The story is about the successors to two rival families who both have the power to build barriers and exterminate demons, among other things (they're called the kekkaishi). At night, their job is to protect the sacred ground known as Karasumori from said demons. The series is mainly about how the kekkaishi defend Karasumori from demons who try to take it over, but there are other things as well.|`|IkAxmfIZaa	~Fullmoon wo Sagashite~<br>  Mizuki(ironically,means fullmoon) is usually a quite girl who does anything her strict grandmother wants,but she loves to sing.Thing is she has throat cancer(i think).She's in love with an old friend who got adopted and moved away.She encounters these beings(shinigami,not like bleach or deathnote.ok)Takuto and Mikaru,who are like ghost who have to watch over people for year before the person dies.When Mizuki finds out, she decides to persue her dreams before she dies.Takuto and Mikaru magically transform her into her 16 year old self.<br>  <br>  ~Shugo Chara~<br>  Hinamori Amu is known publicly as the "Cool and Spicy" chracter,but really,she's a shy and a bit girly,until one day,she finds that three eggs have appeared out of nowhere in her bed!when the eggs hatch,a little person called a 'Chara Guardian' appear,they have power to magically change Amu's character.Yes and there is a group in the school,a popular group of indivisuals, that have titles like,King,Queen,Jester,Joker..etc.except they do more then normal club activities they save Chara Guardian eggs that are being destroyed by a company called Easter as they look a unique egg that fullfills anyone's wishes!XD and Amu accidently confesses her crush to the King her first day in a school assembly!<br>  <br>  ~Cardcaptors Sakura~<br>  My first ever anime,10 year old sakura kinomoto is a normal girl who lives a normal life,untill she finds some old cards,she reads out one card "Wind" and a gust of wind blows all the cards away.little does she know,she's made the biggest mistake of her life!Made by an all female manga group called Clamp|`|FPyktdxvaa	there all awesome animes, you should watch some movies, the movies are much better, like spirited away, *cry* or pricness mononoke.

cIttXzrwaa	Just the greatest song writer and lyricist ever.  Born Jewish in Minnesota, but changed his Jewish name to Bob Dylan after his favorite author Dylan Thomas.  Nominated for many Grammy's and an Honoree of the Kennedy Center for the Arts.  He was "like a rolling stone with no direction home" and Mr. Tambourine Man.  He knew it was "not dark yet, but it was gettin' there".  He knew Hurricane Jones was innocent and wrote a great protest song for that.  He was non-materialistic and his home was pretty much wherever he laid his head.  He was a hippie and a big hit at Woodstock.  He smoked "pot", but wasn't much into heavier drugs.  He believed in God and Jesus and thus wrote the album Slow Train Coming.  Just listen to his music.  He was genius or at least Robert Zimmerman was.|`|OB3BxHCOaa	He is a music legend just like the Beatles.<br>  <br>  Go to www.answers.com and search for his complete biography.<br>  <br>  Go to You tube and search for Bob Dylan crazy interviews, he didn't give a **** with the journalists lol, also type in you tube Bob dylan and John lennon drunk in a car....or Bob dylan asking who throw the glass through the window, it's crazy!!! lol!!!!|`|8zBHJUT7aa	Bob Dylan is God.<br>  He's an American musician, poet, artist, etc. that sings folk music.<br>  He was born May 24, 1941, but if you want anything really specific just<br>  check this out. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also if you enjoy him, you can watch I'm Not There which is a film<br>  with quite a few A-List celebrities who all have the attributes of being<br>  Bob Dylan.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I know you aren't referring to the funk music or anything like it but rather the novel organ music throughout the movie.  This is a very good question.  The organ music should be a genre all its own but has yet to have been created.  John Swihart seems to be the genius behind the music and strangely enough there isn't a whole lot of information to be found on him online.|`|RFCcWPliaa	I'm starring this 'cuz I love all of the music in the movie and I want to know what people have to say.|`|4BxkkB6Yaa	The music genre is called funk.

1lvyUwo7aa	It does to the ones whos mom didn't teach them at a young age what is good and wrong. So teens listen to it and they look up to the rapper so they wanna do what they do, so yeah it does. We have to educate our children before they listen to rap or make them listen to christian rap (which I'm cool with), but some rap is good too. Like Lupe Fiasco or Common. Not all rap is bad, its just what is played on the radio that is negative. So overall it does because most kids listen to the radio.|`|khU8m4gxaa	It all depends on what your home life is like and who your role models are. Hip Hop or any music or film for that matter, can contribute to poor decisions if you don't have any positive influences around you. I know when I was a kid, I listened to NWA & 2 Live Crew, and watched Scarface a million times, but I never been to jail, didn't make a baby, never sold dope. I had a good family, so I knew to just appreciate it for the entertainment value. Hip Hop affected some of my fashion choices & slang, but that's about it.

Av4RauOyaa	The song is called "Boulevard Of Broken Songs".

My opinion anywhooo.|`|99bHvatSaa	I think letters are much more personal.

He thinks the baby is his and that makes me mad...i think he's pretty immature for wanting to marry her...but i think Amy's a little weird about him, too...cuz last week she was talkin about how ben has a job and ricky has a job...ben shouldnt be supporting her and rickys baby, amy and ricky should support their son...ben needs to get w/ the asian girl|`|4aWWpCXzaa	OMG He used to drive me nuts I always wanted Amy to be with Ricky but then I relized he's not that bad I mean he is pushy and annoying but I guess that adds onto the more drama of the show!I can't wait until tonights season ending episode!|`|GUqL7Wtaaa	i used to hate ben soooo much cuz hes weird and clingy.<br>  and i couldnt understand why in the world amy likes him. i mean shes sooo pretty.<br>  but now hes kinda growing on me & i like how sweet he his to her. i like how he's been backing off lately|`|gCeYEQJgaa	Yeah i dont like ben much.

ydHU7gYIaa	well most models are at least 5'9, but i would double check and get measured. ask your doctor how tall you are exactly next time you go. you may be shorter than you think you are. 130 pounds is by no means heavy and you should be happy that you are of a healthy weight. however, in the modeling world, most girls who are closer to 5'10 are this weight- the fashion industry is about extremems and they like extremely skinny for runway. that said, please dont feel you have to lose weight to model yet. you shouldnt worry about this until youre 17 or 18, and if you are in fact tall enough and have the face to model (and still want to). right now if you modeled you would be doing mostly kids catalogs, not high fashion, so you dont need to worry about losing weight anyway (you are already thin if you are indeed that tall). i was a straight model (meaning a size 2), for a few years, and got sick and tired of agonizing over everything i ate every second so i just said screw it and started eating and gaining weight. im a size 8 now, and even though when i was in between a 2 and 8 (it took about 5 years to gain), i didnt book much of anything, my agency said theyd love to keep me on as a plus size model (its pretty ridiculous that a size 8 is considered plus size, but thats fashion for you), and i book quite often- although i do have my height on my side- im 5'10 (which is average for models but uncomfortably taller than most women). so at age 14, you are probably not the weight/size you will be as a late teen/adult,so if you gain weight dont panic- if you do have the right proportions, a strong face, and few more inches in height, you can do plus size if you wanted to- WITHOUT having to starve yourself! yay!

vMZCED9jaa	That sucks.. your theater staff care about that kind of stuff.<br>  If it's not a really popular or big movie theater you could ask you a your dad, mom, brother, aunt, whatever, someone that can get in, to get a ticket and open the exit door in the theater and let everyone come in.<br>  <br>  You could try asking an adult to buy the ticket, and then when you're all sitting down, the adult will leave and get a refund for the ticket.<br>  <br>  Try asking someone that's an adult and ask them to say that they're with you, if questioned.<br>  <br>  Don't be so loud about that kind of stuff....|`|JkEUSooTaa	just stand next to a person old enough for the movie and say your with them or ask a person to pretend to be your parents|`|a4BTluvGaa	I would suggest you go into a different movie theater, since you said the staff people overheard you guys about "sneaking in."

Then Katie thought he was going to propose to her when the ring she found was really for Donna... ackward! lol<br>  <br>  Katie had acne and was the sister with the low self-esteem.

It's about a girl, who is very fierce and violent, teaming up with a delinquent guy to 'catch' their crushes together. Very dramatic and sometimes pretty funny, and in the end doesn't seem to be clear who will end up with who.<br>  <br>  D.N.Angel<br>  <a href="http://www.nanoda.com/public/wallpapers/riku-daisuke-dnangel-big.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.nanoda.com/public/wallpapers/...</a><br>  A boy who transforms into a man who is a thief, and can only 'turn back' when he thinks of his crush. Later on, he falls in love with his crush's twin. Very romantic and cute.<br>  <br>  Kare Kano<br>  <a href="http://eclecticeel.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/karekano-bottom.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://eclecticeel.files.wordpress.com/2...</a><br>  Best romantic anime in my opinion. It's about the relationship between a boy and a girl during high school. The girl tried to do her best to be a 'perfect rolmodel' whilst being very mean on the inside. Her classmate figures it out, and together they fall in love and keep their relationship going. Very realistic, with some more 'adult'-ish humor than slapstick.<br>  <br>  Fruits Basket<br>  <a href="http://www.anime-pictures.info/fruits-basket/fruits-basket6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.anime-pictures.info/fruits-ba...</a><br>  A girl wanders in someone's land and realizes a family of cursed people live there. These people will turn into their respective Japanese star signs (basically into animals) once they are hugged by someone of the opposite sex. The girl then becomes part of the family, and lots of comedy and romance ensues. <br>  <br>  Chibi Vampire/Karin<br>  <a href="http://fs1.us.cyworld.com/data1/2008/04/11/001/1207957201479171_file.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fs1.us.cyworld.com/data1/2008/04/...</a><br>  A girl who's a vampire, actually PRODUCES blood instead of sucking it from other people. She's the oddball in her family, as they are all 'real' vampires. She becomes very attracted to a guy's blood (she's attracted to his 'unhappiness') who's in her class, and thus tries to make friends with him so that he's happy and she won't be attracted to him anymore. Very funny and very romantic anime, definitely worth a watch.<br>  <br>  Midori no Hibi/Midori Days<br>  <a href="http://lakotita.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/midori.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lakotita.files.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  A shy girl has this crush on a guy who has the 'devil's right hand'. By some weird twist of fate, the shy girl actually BECOMES her crush's right hand. She's literally stuck on his right hand and has to figure this out together with her crush. They work together and eventually he returns her love. Very funny and cute.<br>  <br>  That's about all the anime in the category romance/comedy that I'd recommend.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	boku ga ita - good romance<br>  Lovely complex - romantic comedy - very good<br>  skip beat - really funny - very good<br>  nana - good romance<br>  Ouran - really funny<br>  Wallflower - like ouran, really funny<br>  <br>  Hope that helped :)<br>  <br>  Also Fruits basket is good.<br>  School Rumble<br>  <br>  lol..

tQ9CnPfyaa	it's very confusing, but i get wat u mean. she freaks out b/c all the others on her team went crazy from the black smoke. So when Jin disappeared and reappeared, she thought he might've been infected by the black smoke like her team was. 16 years later, she doesn't freak out b/c she never really met Jin. on the last episode so far, the one that aired on 3/4/09, they tell us that Sawyer, Juliet, Jin, Farraday and Miles are stuck in the 1970s after the oceanic 6 returned and the flashes stopped. If they are stuck in 1974 or somewhere near that time, it means that Ruosou never really met Jin b/c 1988 is when Ruosou's team comes to the island. <br>  <br>  Does that makes sense, if it doesn't i can explain it further.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	It was 16 years later. She probably forgot about him. Plus she was crazy from being alone for 16 years.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	The Losties already thought she was crazy, remember she was going off about the disease that claimed her team, and they called her the crazy French woman, so she probably did remember, seeing as how Charles remembered seeing Locke 50 years ago, but she didn't want to say anything because they would have thought she was even more crazy. <br>  <br>  Plus, I'm not sure, but I don't think Rousseau and Jin ever appeared in a scene together. It's too bad that she died, I would have liked to see her acknowledge knowing Jin 16 years before.|`|YIcBd569aa	o.k I don't want a nose bleed so let me try to explain it this way. it hadn't happen yet.  when jin and danielle met for the first time. danielle was an older woman. when the losties went back in time jin and danelle met when danielle was a young pregnant woman. and they were again meeting for the first time for danielle. but not for jin because jin saw danielle as a adult and now see her as a child. but danielle only see jin as an adult . when we go backwards in time danielle is meeting jin for the first time because she is a young girl...? its like this. if I first see you as an adult we meet and say hi. then I go back in time and meet you as a child,(i am still an adult) you will not know me because I am in your past. not my past but your past. so you are meeting me for the first time. you are a child who havn't met me yet as an adult it just hasn't happened yet. Now if I go forward in time again to when you are again an adult you will remember me when you were a kid. so if rousou was still alive and saw jin again as an adult then she would say "hey jin didn't i see you when I was just a pregnant young girl. and now you are older but still look the same"  so danielle knew jin when she was an adult but she never knew him when she was a pregnant young lady.

When they come on I can't change the station fast enough.  There's a voice-over with the same guy literally screaming the same phrase over and over again with slamming, drumming, and fireworks sound effects.  On TV, they put a star around the car and then zoom in and out really fast.<br>  The guy that manages the place used to run a Chevy dealership.  That lot got closed down for illegal trade-in and loan operations.  Like they would offer you $5,000 for your trade-in but then they would tack up to $4,500 onto the price of the new car.  They would also offer one interest rate and then turn around and tack another 2% on in the paperwork.  When they had a "sale" they would just put higher price tags with slashes through them over the original price so it looks like you're paying a lower price but in reality you're not.|`|uLelMuqZaa	I can't stand it when certain channels show advertisements for their new shows, especially ABC Family.

That can't happen... it would be the end of the series... but i cannot think of how he's gonna get himself out of the current situation... but yes... the vizards should come and help... or the Hollow Ichigo emerges coz he did tell Ichigo, not to die before he shows up again.... <br>     Orihime shouldn't heal him again though.... that would spoil it....|`|nOLVHNaBaa	I think Ichigo died but he'll come back alive, trust me just like how Yugi trusts in the heart of the cards.|`|jsgtX7qhaa	I think either the vizards, Isshin, or maybe Urahara will show up to give him time to pull himself together.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Ultraviolet (2006)<br>  starring Milla Jovovich, Cameron Bright, Nick Chinlund, William Fichtner<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Set in the late 21st century, a subculture of humans has  emerged who have been modified genetically by a vampire-like disease, giving them enhanced speed, incredible stamina and acute intelligence. As they are set apart from normal, healthy humans, the world is pushed to the brink of worldwide civil war aimed at the destruction of the diseased population. In the middle of this crossed-fire is Violet, an infected woman, who finds herself protecting a 9-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the government as he is believed to be a threat to human beings.<br>  Here's the movie trailer.

UAHjJpC0aa	It wasn't sampled, but it might have been "influenced" by another song?
IkAxmfIZaa	Some 50 years ago there were two powers in the world. The power of light, Rave, and the power of dark, Dark Bring. In a final showdown against Dark Bring, Shiba used Rave to destroy the dark stone once and for all. After breaking it, a terrible explosion occurred -- this was called Overdrive. Overdrive completely wiped out 1/10ths of the entire world. The explosion gave Dark Bring the chance to escape and Rave was split into five pieces and scattered across the globe. Fifty years later, when Shiba strolled into Garage Island -- he met Haru Glory. Not but five minutes later they're being attacked by a member of the Shadow Guard, the current gang that is using Dark Bring to find Rave and destroy it. While Shiba and Feber (the Shadow Guard lackey) fight, Shiba discovers that Rave will no longer respond to him. Instead, Rave has chosen a new master. And that would be Haru|`|clPvtugSaa	Maybe you can go to the community of <a href="http://www.anime-eden" rel="nofollow">http://www.anime-eden</a> and try your luck.

B46t8gkLaa	caleb mentioned when i saw them life a few months back it was about coming clean from drugs and how he felt like a vampire while trying to do so... hope that helps.|`|OrKLpzenaa	it's not about religion, it's more about love, about the loss of it. I love the first part of the song oozes with anxiety. Words paint you a view, of when the hurricane is about to hit, the lines about the storm bubbling up on the sea kinda hint this out, and those swaying stop signs, plus phone lines being down.<br>  <br>  So with all that unrest, you feel that something bad is about to happen, loneliness possibly? It's coming. So what do you do in that situation? you doubt. You doubt in love, the worst part of it that you'll feel like that many times, because that's life: "driven by the strangle of veins". So you loose your will to live, yet biologically you still go on. That means you gotta go forward and look for something new. The idea of looking for ideal love, looks familliar to christianity doesn't it? where you struggle for faith for your entire life. That's why the two thousand might be the key to the song.<br>  Also I heard that there's a possible vampire theme, which after reading the lyrics seems like a plausible theme, which is pretty cool

hUHwf0hmaa	I liked it a lot but I wish it had "breathed" a little more.  The ending is quite different (and I think, better) than the book, and that was great, but most of it is SO true to the book it just felt a little confined in some bits.  <br>  <br>  I also was disappointed with the music and song choices.  Any original music was completely invisible to me, I just plain didn't notice any.  I did notice "Ride of the Valkyries" and a few Philip Glass mood pieces.  Not that exciting.  Also there were a lot of the "original" versions of songs. Like Simon & Garfunkel "Sound of Silence," and Jimi Hendrix's version of "All Along The Watchtower" (hello, Battlestar Galactica already used this like a year ago), although that one was probably the best one of the original tracks.  I liked the My Chemical Romance version of "Desolation Row" at the very end, and wish they had done this with all of the songs - let a modern band take a run at it.<br>  <br>  But except for that, it really was good, and I think you'll enjoy it.  Pee first and don't take a soda or water in with you.  It's LONG.|`|2KDHWiuAaa	I've never read the comic so my answer is completly based on the movie. Well firstly it was 2hrs and 43mins.  That's pretty long lol. But there was never a dull moment in the movie because their was either action going on or someone explaining the past. I like the movie but it def wasn't what I expected. And I've never seen an ending like that before. Im not sure wether I liked the ending or not lol. But you should def see it :]

8RkYlaQxaa	No. The Misfits are punk. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  MQ: Punk|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	The Misfits are far more closely aligned with punk rock than they are metal.  This isn't to say that they've never been classified as metal since they have that crossover ability not unlike Suicidal Tendencies.  But the more important thing is you can like whatever you damn well please and never have to worry about being a metal-head, a metal purist, totally metal or whatever the case may be.  Don't allow the metal mafia to dictate your taste in music, like whatever it is you like.<br>  <br>  Horror punk is the best description for The Misfits.|`|314092812ee2f93df99495eaf53e0584aa	Listen to what you enjoy. I for one love the Misfits and cite them as one of my favorite bands, even though 2 of the members went on to form metal bands the Misfits themselves were the beginning of Horror Punk.|`|k7jGZydJaa	Nope. I even know metalheads who don't like Metallica. The Misfits aren't even metal (Danzig is though).<br>  <br>  SD: Hardcore punk/horror-punk.|`|PBOvBLnGaa	No, but the fact that your asking if disliking a certain band makes you any less metalhead does take away from your credibility.<br>  Being a metalhead is not like belonging to a club, you dont have to listen to all the bands other guy listen to, you can hate Iron maiden or Metallica but as long as you listen to any kind of metal and love it your a metalhead.<br>  Also alot of guys wear misfits shirts because its a known band and most people will say theyre metalheads or punks because theyre wearing it.<br>  Do yourself a favor, never wear a shirt of a band that either you dont like or dont know, it will just make you look like a poser.<br>  So in short, not liking the misfits doesn't make you any more or less metalhead.<br>  <br>  Side question answer: You could call them Horror punk or Sci-fi punk|`|Y4J6hXajaa	Sorry, but anyone who likes to label themself a "metalhead" has their iPod on too loud. Anyway. No. It doesn't. I like the Misfits, and I don't like the type of music "metalheads" listen to.. I'm more into punk, though.  (SQ: Misfits are horror-themed punk.They take classic sci-fi and horror movie themes and turn them into lyrics. Take Astro Zombies for example, it's about zombies from space destroying the whole human race.) There are a lot of people that don't like the Misfits. You don't have to like them to be a 'metalhead'.|`|JeBwR3Wpaa	Man i tell you if wasnt for the misfits, gbh, discharge etc. You wouldnt have thrash or death metal or hell even black metal to some extent.

e7KoyoWsaa	in brief, condenser mics have their own power supply so they are more sensitive and have a larger range.  But then, they are also much more expensive.  It's like adding power steering to your car - you get more control.|`|bOH5M8cCaa	Condensers need 48v to work (Phantom Power).  It is great for singing, light guitars, overheads on drums.  Condensers have the power to help the plates move, so the mic is more sensitive, and picks up the details of your voice, or softer instruments.  with louder instruments, or live performances of pop/rock, dynamics are best, (less bleed)

hP2nzb2haa	These Games are great ideas to do and play... a lot of FUN!!! <br>  <br>  BLINDFOLD COTTONBALL RACE<br>  Objective: ~~ Transfer as many cotton balls from one bowl to another using only a spoon. The catch? You'll be blindfolded. <br>  Game Type: ~~ Active. A lot of movement may be required. <br>  Players: ~~ 4 or more players <br>  Needed: ~~ Bowls, cotton balls, blindfold, spoons <br>  Rules: ~~ This games works best when you play two players at a time. Blindfold the players and give each a spoon. Place two bowls in front of each player, one of which is has 20 cotton balls. The other bowl is empty. Say go! Each player must transfer as many cotton balls from one bowl to the other in 30 seconds. The trick is that they are so light you can't really feel them on you spoon and this makes it hard. The winner is the player who transfers the most.<br>  <br>  BACK DASH<br>  Objective: ~~ Get your balloons to the finish line first. <br>  Game Type: ~~ Active. A lot of movement may be required. <br>  Players: ~~ 6 or more players <br>  Needed: ~~ 4 round balloons <br>  Rules: ~~ Divide the group into two teams, and then divide each team into pairs. This is a relay race, and the racecourse can extend across a large field or around a building. Mark a start and finish line. Teams of pairs space themselves equally from one end of the racecourse to the other. Pairs stand back to back with elbows linked. Blow up 4 large balloons and give two each to the first pair from each team. One balloon is held in each hand of each player. When the leader says, "Go", the first two pairs make their way to the next pair of linked players. The first pair transfers its balloons to the next pair. The first team to cross the finish line wins. <br>  <br>  TOILET PAPER WRAP<br>  Objective: ~~ Wrap your partner in toilet paper from head to toe as fast as you can! <br>  Game Type: ~~ Active. A lot of movement may be required. <br>  Players: ~~ 4 or more players <br>  Needed: ~~ Toilet paper <br>  Rules: ~~ Each child grabs a partner. One wraps and one is the Statue. Set a time clock to count off seconds. When the time clock starts the wrapper has to completely wrap up their partner from head to toe. It's harder than you think but also a lot of fun. The first one to wrap up their partner completely with no body parts showing wins!! One roll of toilet paper per team. <br>  <br>  LIFESAVER RACE<br>  Objective: ~~ Pass a lifesaver from player to player using only a toothpick! A relay race game. <br>  Game Type: ~~ Active. A lot of movement may be required. <br>  Players: ~~ 6 or more players <br>  Needed: ~~ Straws Lifesavers <br>  Rules: ~~ First divide your group into two teams. Each team will need to be lined up facing the forward. Then take a bunch of toothpicks and give each player one. The player at the beginning of the line gets the lifesaver. Before you begin, everybody puts the toothpicks into their mouth and then the captain (first person in each line) puts a lifesaver on his/her toothpick. The object is to pass the lifesaver from team member to team member using only the toothpick, no hands allowed! The first team to pass it down to the end of the line wins. If the lifesaver falls on the floor then you must start at the beginning again. <br>  <br>  FLOUR TAG<br>  Objective: ~~ A fun tag game where you get tagged with flour filled nylon sacks. <br>  Game Type: ~~ Active. A lot of movement may be required. <br>  Players: ~~ 6 or more players <br>  Needed: ~~ Dark shirts Flour Nylon stockings <br>  Rules: ~~ Choose a person to be the referee. Determine a jail area. Each player must have a dark T-shirt on (black or navy blue work well). Give each player a nylon that is filled with flour. Tie the nylon at the end to make it into a ball shape. The group plays tag as normal but players are knocked out by throwing the flour torpedoes at each other. You will be able to see who has been hit because they will be hit with a flour mark. The referee must keep their eye on the players and call out those who are hit to the jail area. Keep a damp rag handy to clean up the shirts between rounds. <br>  <br>  Variation: ~~ Make two teams. Set up a flag at each end of the playing field. Have the teams have to get the flag from their opponents’ side with out being tagged. <br>  <br>  <br>  All of these games can be found at... www.partygamecentral.com for all ages.|`|NKbJeWcMaa	A grass skirt shaking contest<br>  Tiki torches<br>  Some kind of a sacrificial ritual to a fake but cool looking volcano<br>  A really tasty, blue drink in a big punch bowl and glasses with little umbrellas<br>  Girls can make ankle bracelets or flower necklaces while guys do mask making or face painting

This is a powerful laxative, and if she consumes too much, she will be dashing for the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Instead, suggest that she apply MoM to the itchy, flaky, red areas of her skin.

Frank led him to a golf course after he told Donnie the world was going to end. (apparently since he woke up on a putting green) Donnie lives through the 28 days with no problem at all (minus the odd events, burning down Cunnigham's house, and shooting Frank in the eye when he gets out of the car after having hit Donnie's girlfriend. Once the 28 days are up. Donnie is sent back in time through the wormhole. He begins to laugh hysterically after seeing what his 28 day future would be like if he left the house then and there. Instead he decides to deny that fate, and he stays in his room and waits to die (then surely enough comes the plane turbine killing him)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that clears up the confusion.|`|4g7KvIAMaa	In short, he effectively goes back in time and chooses to let the jet engine killing him therefore saving his girlfriend and others from harm.<br>  <br>  It does go a lot deeper than that and some of it is never really explained.

LrKCLZF7aa	I will try to be brief about this but several volumes have been written on the subject of midpoints. First the definition is pretty simple. It's the middle point of two planets. and every planet has two mid points. Most astrologers forget about the other one but it is as valid as it's opposite midpoint.<br>  <br>  The Magi Society has stated in there second book that midpoints are AS POWERFUL AS PLANETS.  This is a mighty statement about midpoints.<br>  <br>  Now with that being said there are different orders of how important a midpoint is based on the power of the planets involved. The more powerful the more important. So Pluto Jupiter is obviously the most powerful of all. <br>  <br>  The symbolism of midpoints is usually a combination of the two planets' symbolism. But they are NOT the same as an aspectarian interpretation. One of the main exceptions to this is midpoints involving Saturn, in which case Saturn takes the role of Control. For example Saturn Venus midpoint could be Control of Attraction or control of money. These examples are extremely brief and I wouldn't rely on only these for interpretation. There are many more. However these are accurate.<br>  <br>  A midpoint becomes even more important when it is in aspect of a planet or another midpoint. These are two subjects and I will shorty explain both.<br>  <br>  When it's in a conjunction with a planet it's called a Midpoint Crossing.<br>  When midpoints are in conjunction with other midpoints they are called Magi Quads. Magi astrology revealed the secrets of Magi Quads in there second book and this book sell for usually $200 used. They are completely sold out. I own one but will not sell it or even lend it out. Not even to my relatives. Magi Quads are the best tool for finding out what a person is good at and what they will be happy at and be able to make money.<br>  <br>  Everyone has Magi Quads and there are even midpoints in Declinations. This may be way over your head and if it is, I'm sorry. If you know what I'm talking about then great. Either way I'm expecting that you can learn.<br>  <br>  Mid points can get even more complicated. I use 10 basic planets, Chiron, the 4 major asteroids and Sedna in my readings. So this makes 16 astrobodies. That's 240 midpoints. And that creates a lot of aspects. I mean everyone will have Grand Trines and Yods and Grand Crossings and T-squares when that many midpoints are taken into account. If this were the case it would take forever to do a reading and no one would have time to live. That would suck! So it's always better to know what you are looking for and how to find it. This is accomplished through a thorough knowledge of PLANETARY SYMBOLISM. It's impossible with out it.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Sorry but it a rerun of the original show.  Here`s the latest information on Christy that I could find.<br>  <br>  Epilogue: At the end of the original episode, the black screen update at the end indicated that Cristy, who had left rehab early against her family's wishes and entered jail rather than bow to the pressure of returning for 60 more days of treatment, was given a choice by the judge at her sentencing for her DUI arrest: Rehab for a year, or several months in jail. Cristy chose jail. While in jail, she was able to get clean from both meth and alcohol, but relapsed shortly after her release. The black screen update after the episode was re-aired in March 2008 indicated that Cristy is now living with "a close friend" in L.A. and is attending AA meetings in an attempt to regain sobriety.|`|hTr1dpTiaa	It's a rerun :/ I'm watching it now. But they'll give an update at the end of it and say how she's doing. Such a crazy one though, gotta be the most intense episode.|`|MQf80RUgaa	i just watched it,it wasnt a follow up.<br>  i didnt like her.just like 90% on the show i hate.<br>  but i find few are very good people that want help and turn out well.<br>  im a grown man and the the one that almost made me cry was hubert.what a great guy he is and just needed help in life.remember he was a homeless alcoholic,his neice found him in a parking lot sleeping and laid beside him and both cried.<br>  i do watch this show alot and believe most need to be put away for a long time.thats my view.
Jd8IAhCYaa	blink182 is hardly anything challenging, if you have never played guitar before starting with songs like blink182, Greenday bands like that etc, is a good starting point IF you want to learn songs. <br>  <br>  If you want i could teach you to read tab so you could learn them<br>  <br>  - Kingy|`|WLk6SHBhaa	if you really really wanted to you could honestly learn a song a day by them.<br>  i learned "dammit" which was one of my first songs in probably less than 2 hours. i had just picked up a guitar when i played this.<br>  and the rest of them are extremely simple.<br>  a lot of easy consecutive parts that repeat alot. blink 182 songs are<br>  really good to start off with because they are not too hard and because<br>  they sound harder than they actually are. start with all the small things <br>  and dammit first.|`|uUDNcsyUaa	more like a 2-year old could play it...<br>  <br>  Seriously though, there stuff is incredibly easy...you could learn it in a few minutes, even if you don't play guitar|`|zrQLxnfgaa	ya blink-182 is a good place 2 start green day is probably a little harder just depends on the song<br>  umm<br>  depends how good u wanna get<br>  if u just wanna know the basics like a year if u try ur hardest<br>  but if u wanna get really good u should practice ur whole life or until u just cant play aka <br>  in a nursing home or just dont have the will 2 play anymore
eNaSiUsZaa	Piano man by billy joel<br>  <br>  <br>  very very easy, but sounds sweet|`|cCTA62Ehaa	it really depends upon what you mean by easy...i really like "river Flows in You" by Yiruma and it's fairly easy<br>  You could also try the theme from jurassic park. it's not reallly easy but its super slow so that helps :)<br>  <br>  For music, go to: <a href="http://pianolicious.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pianolicious.blogspot.com/</a>

tQ9CnPfyaa	he says "I miss you Libby". She was the girl that was with the other survivors that crashed on the other side of the island. When all the oceanic 815 survivors reunited, Hugo meets Libby, they become friends, and he falls in love with her, and she falls in love with him. She died because Michael shot her when he was helping Ben escape from the Hatch b/c he wanted his son back. He shot her by accident, but he still shot her and AnaLucia.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Hurley was in love with Libby, the girl that was shot by Michael in the hatch.|`|ydbYPofqaa	Probably libby the girl he loves who is shot by Michael.

Um8osMNuaa	He is dead, she was just imagining him, l think all the stuff about the guy who should have got the heart that she gave to Denny brought it all back to her. Although it was nice to see him again.|`|frA6KJwIaa	yeah, so, denny is a ghost and izzy can see him and interact with him. basically she's gone crazy. she tests herself to find out what is wrong with her and she found out she may have cancer. denny tells her he is here for her. meaning, he is waiting for her to die to take her spirit with him. get it? he is "here for her"<br>  <br>  that's bout it.|`|3cc6c09c60543d771e36483bedb5a1adaa	We're currently in season 5. Back in season 2, Denny was admitted to the hospital with a bad heart. After undergoing many surgeries, an LVAD was inserted in him until he got a heart. Izzie fell in love with him. Well, he almost got a heart, but someone beat him out by 17 seconds. Izzie cut his LVAD wire so he could move up on the transplant list and get the heart. He proposed to her during this dramatic scene where they're trying to keep him alive until he gets his heart. He gets the heart but then dies. <br>  <br>  Izzie is seeing him in visions now, well, was, until he finally left. <br>  <br>  We found out she has cancer in the next episode, 5.17, "I Will Follow You Into The Darkness". <br>  <br>  Denny is dead.|`|bVp9CeTIaa	Denny is dead but he came back for Izzy. As in he is HERE for her, not as in to be with her but here for her, because she has cancer. Nobody knows it's cancer but it keeps implying it, she found a lump on her back. I don't want her to die, she's a great character.|`|naKJDQMaaa	he's dead, came back to tell her that she was sick...she finally figures it out.<br>  Then u start to see how she acts weird and must be sick then she finds a tumor...and thats how far we got. Basically it seems like she's going to die to which sucks!|`|S7jhThbmaa	He is dead. :( <br>  <br>  He presented himself to her to let her know she is ill; she has cancer.  After she figured it out, he vanished.
WqJk2yJiaa	maybe you look just like someone. you want to take a risk b/c you love the book and movies so much. maybe your a good actress.<br>  <br>  its hard to say when i don't know anything about you. sorry. hope that helped.|`|GKEDoCFTaa	Your a lunar... tic|`|DiWtE0Ksaa	beacause u love the BOOKS and u were born to be in that movie!! :D|`|HRtqw6cbaa	umm.. <br>  <br>  Well try to be heartfelt and convince them that you are desperate. For example you could say things like;<br>  <br>  "This has been my dream for my whole entire life and now there is chance!"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  "You wouldnt be able to find someone better!"<br>  <br>  or even<br>  <br>  "My whole life I have been in the corner by myself, and I'm ready to break free and show my true personality that no one has seen yet, I need to express myself!"<br>  <br>  you might even try begging<br>  <br>  "Please, please, I need to be in this it is the only thing I want, I will never need anything else!"<br>  <br>  ha ha, just think if someone was begging you, what would convince you, and be crwative, don't just say that you are the world's biggest fan of the Twilight Saga, because that is exactly what every other person who is applying will say. I hope you make it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)

OrKLpzenaa	It's about someone that had a one-night stand and wants to know why the other person hasn't called yet. They are trying to make excuses for why they haven't called to protect their ego hence the line "maybe there's something wrong with his phone," but they know why really "or maybe its morning and the thrill is gone." They are just saying that if it wasn't for the other night and the one night stand they could have been in love and in a relationship instead of a fling for one night. They are trying to forget the one night stand and once they do get that phone call from the guy just wanting a booty call, they realize that they like him and want more than that, so they have to let it and him go.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	T-Tiny<br>  O-Onions<br>  N-Never<br>  Y- Yell

You might be irritating ur skin from too many products. just settle down with 1.Hope I helped! good luck! :) ;) :) :) :) :) :) :) :> :> :>|`|ZIrTB2oEaa	ha ha ha<br>  <br>  its not your face that makes you so dirty, so give it a rest, overscrubbing will just cause irritation.<br>  <br>  maybe thats just your skin color, try bleaching it like Michael Jackson did, I bet he felt dirty too.|`|YQxNd46Waa	First Off. Wrong part of Yahoo Answers. That wasn't a joke, or entertaining. As for your question. I have no clue.|`|d1tyTq6Saa	take 2 showers per day and go to a spa and ask them what is good 4 ur skin!|`|y3P2FgMpaa	You need to at LEAST wash your face twice a day. PER DAY.|`|5A24XhTfaa	oo cool i use the same scrub|`|AA11905223	sounds like you've tried about everything, so the only thing left to do is shave your *** and walk backward or re-post this in the correct category.|`|TpNHTevSaa	wash your face three times a day.
gGZz2EGyaa	The only thing I can suggest is to email or telephone the venue to see what they say about passes.  Perhaps Metallica have a web site you could always go on there and email them to see what they say as well.  They can only say no, or they might even say yes, you will never know till you try.

AA11025703	I think largely, it was a matter of Ratings.<br>  <br>  In general, if a woman served on the Enterprise she wore a short skirt.<br>  <br>  When ST:The Next Generation began, to level things out, they periodically showed some Women, AND, Men in short skirts.<br>  <br>  It appears to simply have been a matter of differing uniform style.<br>  <br>  If you want for someone to look at you and think/say "She's wearing an outfit from ST:TOS, then go with the miniskirt.|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	In the older tv series I thought all women wore skirts. But I don't know about Deep Space 9, Enterprise
WkcYzNjSaa	I think you're missing a number...<br>  <br>  Well what did the guy say when you called??<br>  <br>  I'm guessing it's an automated answering thing set up on purpose. (it's not just some random person's telephone number. I bet if it was they would have changed their number by now with all the phone calls they're getting) A lot of celebs have a thing called "SayNow" where you call their "voicemail" and leave a message and sometimes they will listen to it and call you back.<br>  <br>  Update: I found it.. <a href="http://www.saynow.com/souljaboytellem" rel="nofollow">http://www.saynow.com/souljaboytellem</a>|`|NZ3rA9rlaa	omg i freaked me the f*ck out i almost hung up but it only does it the first time you call call it from a different fone and listen thro the whole thing and he says naa im just playing wit you|`|bKjgjXmdaa	haha thats hillarious hu picked up|`|JavoRs6Raa	no, i don't want no gay sex lines picking up.  Soulja boys a fag.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	this girl in my class did, and she got all mad cause it was just a automatic voice. It was hilarious cause now she hates him.|`|CCA0mTgsaa	ARAB ANSWERED
w9LOTXXxaa	The sounds you want to achieve are basically polar opposites but there is a way around that.<br>  It all depends on your budegt and how far you're prepared to stretch it.<br>  I would suggest looking at the Seymour Duncan webite for a start as they are probably the biggest, quality dealer of after market pick-ups.<br>  You will want to change your neck pick-up to an Alnico II magnet (blues) and any over wound bridge pick-up should meet your Petrucci style needs.<br>  If you want his sound I would also suggest looking at swapping out the bridge for anything by EMG but those do require batteries
GFndpsBaaa	I personally have to say I think they should have ended it after he escaped. Everything after that felt- stretched.

Especially the music.|`|91052aeeaae7f679e0597b8689a2057aaa	This is the first movie I've seen in ten years that made me feel like I didn't throw my money away. Best movie I've seen without any well know actors or very little known producer and director. I would pay to see it again.|`|A3GZ3NxHaa	I Want it for Blu-Ray already !|`|DIxbib1paa	Whats the deal with this film, people are going mad for it! Whats so good about a load of indians!

00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	The movie you're describing sounds like The Journey aka(Sancharram) (2004) <br>  <br>  The Journey depicts the story of Kiran and Delilah, young Indian women who grow up together in a small rural village and eventually fall in love. When Delilah’s mother discovers their relationship, she forces Delilah into an arranged marriage, in order to mollify the scandal and preserve the family name. Delilah suggests to Kiran that a solution is for each to get married to men, and then continue to see each other when and where possible. Kiran says that she cannot do that. She cannot live a lie or a hollow life, possibly causing great harm to another|`|PCNWFX4laa	East is east? its about muslims growing up in England well the first part sounds like it i never saw the end =P

That's like asking if Pepsi drinkers have better relationships with their mothers than Coke drinkers.  Someone is going to have to adequately illustrate how there's any viable correlation between escapist entertainment fandom and racially influenced interractions for me to agree there's something worth exploring.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Of course... Spock is half human!<br>  <br>  LOL @ Proto<br>  <br>   I agree, the movie FANBOYS settles any remaining Star Wars vs Star Trek fan questions.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	What if you're a fan of both?
BTvSJcFlaa	As mentioned above, these two have met. While on Flash's world, he easily beat Quicksilver because he had the Speed Force available. When Flash ended up on Quicksilver's world, however, he had no connection to the Speed Force, and, therefore, had no powers. If his vibrational rate hadn't have slowed back down to the DC normal, causing him to return to his world, a mob of mutant haters might have killed him.|`|AA11025703	Well, as for speed, I gotta ask which Flash are you refering to??<br>  <br>  Marvel and DC did do a race between the 2 though.  According to <a href="http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/marvel-dc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/marvel-d...</a> when they raced each other The Flash beet out Pietro.|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Flash is much, much faster than Quicksilver  could ever be.  He has beat Superman running.  Flash can move so fast he can vibrate his body through solid walls.  Quicksilver can move a supersonic speeds and that's about it.  That's pretty darn fast but not close to approaching Flash's speed.

dttNFTXYaa	i think its about that they broke up and that she just needs to take a step back from things and BREATHE i think that he broke up with her because she says in the song that she never wants to see him hurt so if she would have broke up with him she would have hurt him but im confused|`|269Jcwlaaa	Julia E. stfu. because that was not the question.  And Taylor Swift is one of the best singers ever. and shes real!<br>  <br>  I think they just both broke up. like it was both of their decisions and she just is like idk how to explain it.  She needs to get back on her feet and breathe on her own.|`|lPYNdyZ7aa	The song is about saying your sorry.(that is what she is saying as the song ends.)  It is about how she is sorry for hurting someone and hates that she did it.|`|bBGBFOWhaa	why would u want to know she sucks.

That's mainly what we know about.<br>  <br>  Check out the Beatles.|`|dDOc608Raa	Why would you post your question in the classical section when you don't want classical music?<br>  <br>  You ma'am... are an idiot.|`|025wasRZaa	I am with William Gilbert on this one:<br>  <br>  'You ma'am are an idiot'|`|qWNdhGVXaa	I actually think Vanessa Mae is a rather poor player|`|ebe9af0dbeaeb8a4623c52d9fc71c05faa	Considering some of the bands you mentioned, there is not alot of violin music in popular music. <br>  <br>  That said there are a couple of performers that you might like.<br>  <br>  As ?LuckySum? pointed out, Vanessa Mae is a popular if not overly talented violinist, who has made a name for herself.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ798THmR5Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ798THmR...</a><br>  <br>  Miri Ben-Ari - is very definitely cut to the same mold as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CCkagE15sk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CCkagE15...</a><br>  <br>  Along those lines, is the popular classical outfit called the Bond Girls, a British import clearly able to command a decent quartet in the popular circuit.<br>  <br>  They tend to however over-depend upon the other facets of their music sampling etc rather than have the violins be the main focus. <br>  <br>  This is such that some people may suggest, that with all three performances, they take well known classical pieces, "pimped out" (so to speak) and throw an occasional violin fiddling in there from time to time.<br>  <br>  Explosive - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmx9itey7o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmx9itey...</a><br>  <br>  Consider the original piece as here : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrHvnicQla8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrHvnicQl...</a> <br>  <br>  As compared with Bond's "Viva"  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WrKdlDqM7g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WrKdlDqM...</a> - this is just a "tiny bit" pimped out version of Antonio Vivaldi's "Winter piece of the Four Seasons", with a heavy bass-line and some explosions.<br>  <br>  So, that said from a purely technical perspective, I'm not sure that's what any of these young ladies is really looking do is convey to the audience that they have a high degree of skill with their violin playing. They are entertainers first, performers second.<br>  <br>  But alot of times people consider violins - unless they are pimped out with explosions, as "old" music. But that's not really true.<br>  <br>  There is of course the last entry along these lines "Beethoven Virus" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zzMk0NEjX0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zzMk0NEj...</a><br>  <br>  I submit a couple of these songs - produced by equally modern performers who are also VERY good.<br>  <br>  Here the violin is an accompaniment to a piano and a mandolin but it's essential for the piece. <br>  <br>  Hem's 1/2 Acre - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0CWvbl51o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0CWvbl5...</a><br>  <br>  There's some non-traditional, modern Violin music which is (I think) really quite good : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0Wro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0W...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  One of my favorites is from the show Battlestar Galactica - of all things they managed to find themselves a full on musical genius Bear Mc Creary (all of 22 years old) for their composer who's got a "thing" for violins - It's classical, but it's modern but it definitely surprises people when they hear it : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU80" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU...</a><br>  <br>  There is a Japanese pop fascination with "Victorian" and or "Vampire" themes (I think I just cop to being a Gaijin (Gaijin is a slightly insulting term for being Non-Japanese) in trying to figure out Japanese pop culture - since I'm still have problems telling slightly depressed Goths from Emo's) <br>  <br>  That said here's a variation of the Cello piece "Cannon Wakeshima" - the theme music from Vampire Knight - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Xkxs4eA0I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Xkxs4eA...</a> - while a violinist or cellist will blanche at the idea we will for our conversation simply consider a cello a large violin.<br>  <br>  And in that way, you could also consider this piece by Sting which is absolutely haunting and a variation of Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé - Romance, written during some of the very dark days of the Cold War.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rk78eCIx4E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rk78eCIx...</a>

hP2nzb2haa	This can be big or small party… it can be held at home or rent a banquet hall. <br>  <br>  So how about… “A Blacklight/Glow In The Dark Party"… it’s pretty simple. Hire a DJ for this party. These days DJs now have all equipments for blacklights/glow in dark lights plus strobe lights or a disco ball, it add a very fun impact to your dance floor. Go for it. (DJ is not cheap for this service.) Play Techo/Dance music. Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room or rent banquet hall.<br>  <br>  Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces)  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  <br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Make gangster graffiti. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark!  Tell your friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some: (it's not necessary to have these)<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Invitations: <br>  Get “Crayola Color Explosion? Neon” it lets you create wild multicolored effects with a single color-reveal marker! The unique clear-ink marker works only with black Color Explosion paper, revealing hidden colors for amazing designs. <br>  <br>  Includes a 20-page black tablet with Neon Color Reveal, 3 Color Reveal markers, a stencil sheet and a re-sealable storage bag. To make many invitations, cut in half like a postcard… enjoys… this is ones cool invitations!<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of green or yellow Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow!  You could have "the best glow in the dark face paint", best dance, most creative, etc. Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Do what you can do...it’s not necessary to do all, just be creative. Have a super great time!

Total bummer dude :(<br>  <br>  On the upside it looks like <br>  <a href="http://www.beyondhollywood.com/johnny-quest-the-movie-is-coming/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondhollywood.com/johnny-qu...</a><br>  <br>  and <br>  26 eps total with Dr. Zen making gold apparently with only a season one. Don't buy the dvd's it has been edited to conform with PC censors.

XNIkS3KNaa	Well I really hate crying in front of people.  <br>  <br>  I've only cried in front of people twice and both times were pretty recent.  The first was a my friend's funeral, I let it out for about 5 minutes in front of everyone.  I couldn't hold it in any longer and seeing her huge picture in the church did the trick.  I quickly got it together.  <br>  <br>  The second time was when my cousin died.  That whole week I cried in front of people for once.  That was really hard, too hard for even me to hold together.  Although I held it together the most out of my family.  It's only been a month since he died.  It's still hard. :(<br>  <br>  I'm feel the same as you do on the crying thing.  No one has a clue how I really feel. :)|`|x9WmBlu4aa	when my first daughter was born i blubbered like an idiot in front of the nurses doctors etc through share delight and through the relief that wife and baby were fine.......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   .....many years later after  my 5th was born i was crying  again only this time it was through thinking  OH NO  not again the sleepless nights  nappy changes  puking babies lack of money and lack of social life in general|`|CArzkDIUaa	I have cried in front of people, and it was bad because i had a lot of bad events that led up to that|`|HRQjffv8aa	Nope, I dont like showing weakness but if its something really painful then I probably would..thats rare though.|`|wmBK9uASaa	Only when I was about 5,,|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Alone at night, if i ever do which is rare|`|bIouq64Oaa	Well, at P.E. one day this girl in our class threw a football at my face and it hit me on the mouth. It didn't really hurt that much, and then I started bawling for no apparent reason. Everyone was like, "Are you okay? What's wrong?" and I was like, "I'm fine!" But I couldn't stop crying! <br>  <br>  It was an accident.<br>  <br>  ...Or was it??|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea i know i def. have cried in front of a bunch of people, but can't remember the reason lol.|`|ohHEQimxaa	NOOOOO , neither|`|1K8NPRUOaa	i usually cry in private since i don't like it when others worry about me.|`|1d189d211710842a2fef70f9f5dbf40baa	Yes, i cry too easily.<br>  <br>  i actually cried this morning in school.<br>  (pmsing..cramps..yikes O_O)|`|jlZZbdIjaa	I don't cry...no i do but rarely.

I can't show any emotion anymore as I don't know what it all means<br>  I'm soooooo confused|`|dCPH9pGgaa	It depends what I am crying about...<br>  <br>  If it is something I know I'm feeling sorry for myself for, then I'll try not to ball in front of anyone.<br>  <br>  But then again, if something happend that I felt like I needed to cry in front of someone then I would. I don't really think about crying, or where to do it...|`|PnhAho6xaa	Never in front of people, I have cried only a few times at home because I was either so sad or frustrated or something  depressing happened to make me cry.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	only time was at a funeral|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	yes i have.....im not guna tell u why tho lol

kXxaUnSUaa	Hmm, not sure about these - I can see why they were deleted from the movie.<br>  <br>  The finger bite scene is so out of character for Edward - firstly, he wouldn't fall over, and secondly, I just don't think he would bite Bella's finger, when he's always being so protective of her.<br>  <br>  The woods scene is good - it adds a bit more fear & danger, which came across in the book but not really in the movie.<br>  <br>  The bedroom scene is just wrong! I think it totally takes away the chemistry and tension from their actual first kiss - because if I remember correctly this scene happens before they get together. So if you've already seen them make out in a 'dream' before they actually do make out for real, it kind of ruins the build up. Do you know what I mean?<br>  <br>  Still, really interesting to see the deleted scenes - hope there's some more on the DVD! :)|`|vPTb0oEEaa	Hey its me again and just to let you know what you said was down right snoty!

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	When it comes to ratings, the only ones that really count are live viewings by Nielsen families.  DVR viewing is tracked, but doesn't carry much weight.  Same for online viewing at legal sites like hulu and abc.com, nbc.com etc and downloads via iTunes.  If several million people watch online then that can maybe help with sponsorship deals, but the number they're most interested in is live viewers who see the commercials.  <br>  <br>  Obviously illegal viewing via sites like surfthechannel doesn't get tracked at all, and that's a lot of people as well.

Because a lot of men think that what feels good for them feels good for the girl. And that is definitely not the case. Woman take longer to get aroused and a lot of men do not take the time to get a woman to full arousal so that she can orgasm, much less even know what spot to touch so that she can orgasm. Men do not know a woman's body, nor do they take the time to learn to know how she needs to be pleased in order to orgasm. (Here's a hint it involves your fingers and tongue, it involves slow strokes and gentle rubbing to the clitoris) A lot of  men watch porn to learn what girls like, which is foolish because porn is made to the liking and pleasure of a man and all the women in porn are FAKING- big time. It's not all men's fault though. The problem is that a lot of girls don't know they're own bodies well enough to even know what pleasures them so it is impossible to even tell a guy what she likes. Girls have to masturbate to learn they're bodies, just like boys do when they are young.|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Because as promiscuous as some girls can be, they still care about your feelings and knowing that you can't please them can be a big downer. Also, they also are pretending because the girl doesnt want to face the awkward fact that sex isnt always hoops and hollers so they play along for their sake as well.|`|yTYEd6Ghaa	i think when girls get in bed with a guy they really like them and i guess if they fake it they feel like they are making that guy feel good about themselves. i dont think they do it for themselves but for the guy they are with :)|`|mNZCMuSpaa	pahah again-- sexual cargo.|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	they fake it cause they just wanna go to sleep cause they're tired<br>  or they don't wanna hurt the guy's feelings.<br>  <br>  well...ur just s*xual cargo?....i think u cud do better.....<br>  drop the symbols<br>  maybe put stars on it...like mine...isn't mine completely awesome? lol.|`|xXyy51Efaa	Not all girls are fake.

I mean I enjoy the sex like the rest of the world but sometimes it's just not good enough, so I fake one. I'm ashamed of it, but really what else CAN I do. It'd be embarrassing to get into it and say "Get off of me I'm not feeling anything."|`|OQF1HlwRaa	lol uh sexual cargo.<br>  nice, very clever.<br>  makes you sound like a mail-order bride.<br>  <br>  <br>  im not going to lie, i fake it because i haven't had one yet and my bf tries really hard to get me there and i do not want to hurt his feelings so i've pretended to get there because i knew his mom was home, then he had to stop before his mom came downstairs so its likeee...you ALMOST got me there but you have to stop..tooooo baddd *wink*.<br>  i feel incomplete. like. they're trying so hard to get me to orgasm when in reality i orgasm when you're not trying.<br>  but because you're trying,  i don't want you to think something is wrong.<br>  so i moan a little bit and idk it makes me feel good that you're trying to make me feel good even if you're not making me feel good whatsoever.<br>  <br>  i just don't want to hurt his feelings i guess.<br>  its kind of awkard to always say no, baby thats not where it is or no, touch me there.<br>  <br>  it takes away from the moment i believe.<br>  <br>  <br>  ironic, huh?|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	BWAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAAAHAHAHAAHA...|`|EvDoLydgaa	Does it really matter?|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Ego points for you.<br>  <br>  And it's all right.

0DgP34ssaa	"subarashi", i would love for that to happen but it wont,naruto transformed into the 6 tailed fox and yamato returned from his mission so my guess is he is going to return naruto to normal and take him back to the village hospital, since naruto was in a bad shape after he went back from the 4 tailed ,can u imagine what will happen because of the six tailed<br>  <br>  i dont really think it will happen because, i am sure after naruto becomes hospitalized and wakes up he wont remember hinata's confession, he forget lots of stuff after he returned to normal because of the 4 tails,but know he is in 6<br>  <br>  <br>  but i do really want to see it happen|`|gzxjcVURaa	Yeah the L dude is right. Naruto is going to be pretty messed up so they will probably meet in the hospital. I'll bet Hinata will be standing over Naruto's bed in tears when he wakes up and tells her he beat Pain all for her. He'll look into her eyes there will be a long awkward silence... and Hinata's face will turn red and she will take him in her arms and whisper "Thank you" into his ear. She'll lay him down and we see he has a huge smile on his face and RED cheeks he's in love too.....<br>  <br>  I'd like that to happen...|`|EI9dKzy9aa	naruto and hinata are such a cute couple!

You can also mix it with some leave in conditioner. This will repel any live lice.

I prefer to know that my contacts can BE CONTACTED and is not afraid of receiving emails from others.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone is entitled to MY opinion.|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	If I noticed that they have similar interests as mine. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If they are from my country (I'm from Egypt, so, not very often to come across an Egyptian user.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If I noticed they give thorough and informative answers in subjects in which I'm ignorant yet interested (e.g. Computers & Internet).<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If they asked an extra-ordinary interesting question or gave an extra-ordinary interesting answer (in any category).<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If they have a lot of points (like those on the Y!A Global Overall Leader Board) !!!<br>  <br>  =)|`|xXyy51Efaa	Their Avatar Pic. or their answers|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Some days I just love to read avatars. .  If one is interesting I look at their Q's and A's and something will click !  I have some best friends I have met this way. . . Also when someone asks to be my contact, I always let them, because something I have said must have clicked for them too. . again, they usually become best friends !<br>  <br>  Edit. . . LOL. . just like the one above me,  she is a contact and best friend !!!|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	If their sense of humor is similar to mine.|`|87yovKYlaa	they must have a sick and twisted sense of humor.|`|pj02ePxAaa	bc they ask me to. ?|`|547Ln6rNaa	Sometimes they have said something I really liked (read: wish I'd said), and sometimes if we share a very unpopular opinion I add them to show solidarity.|`|ZEXGmO5Zaa	Usually if their questions are funny or they leave an entertaining answer <br>  <br>  and hell sometimes if the guy looks good <br>  <br>  why not?|`|r5h7TmWJaa	I usually don't. Contacts on here are confusing. lol It's not like myspace or whatever. You can't message them back and forth unless it's through email.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	It depends on how the question is asked and stuff. If it's funny, heck yeah I would add that person.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	If they are interested in the same things I am interested in.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|dqCTS60raa	If they have something in commob with me.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	When they agree with me!|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	For a long time I had no contacts, just read the Q's and A's.

So now if I find someone interesting, like their Q's and A's, I will add them!|`|9nfkTVm6aa	How reliable and detailed their answer is. You can tell when some one is really helpful or not. Some people you can tell really care.|`|AA12140229	1. if they can spell<br>  2. if they can think<br>  3. if they can keep it clean<br>  4. sense of humor helps too.<br>  <br>  that sounds like what you would look for in a man!   lol|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Their avatar, and their interests and if they even take the time to add me or email me|`|xhazgUllaa	If their questions are funny, entertaining or turn me on.|`|uGxWOIOdaa	same interests & excellent answers.|`|96K22Vhtaa	i have never gone out of my way to add someone, i just add all the people that add me :)

7HbaDLUNaa	Yes it does, But it is very hard to find. The right person will have love, passion, desire, loyalty, the person of your dreams. One that can give the unconditional love to you, and it knows no limits. But like anything it has to come from both sides to make it work. Keep looking it is there and when you find it. It will be worth you taking your time to find it. Good Luck to you :-)<br>  (s)|`|fP05U8Neaa	Yes, you just have to find the right person|`|IKnEeMXLaa	defiantly, if you have the right person you can find pure true love
e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Oh, Ken's a total douche.  He spends all his money on hair products and erectile dysfunction creams.<br>  <br>  Maybe if Barbie wasn't such a Johnny Job Jumper and stuck with one of her 73 different careers, she wouldn't be up shite creek without her glamourous pink paddle.|`|9f7xplRuaa	she'll have to move back to the Trailer park I suppose|`|9IvcV7tiaa	Poor Barbie, her pink Corvette convertible also got repo'ed and now she's living in an old van with Ken down by the river.|`|AA11609168	when are you going to stop playing with dolls bro?|`|TlcMyJeuaa	Does she still have her Corvette?  She could maybe sell it, or turn tricks behind it. or just drive it really fast off a cliff.  Really, I think the Corvette is key.|`|AA10282820	A goverment-backed loan modification is her best recourse to keep her home.

Joe is buying up a lot of the foreclosed properties.  She will probably put on her shortest skirt, sluttiest heels and stroll over to his mansion.  I predict she will get herself pregnant, he will do the honorable thing by marrying her, she will cheat on him, they will divorce, she will take half of everything he owns and then continue with her on again, off again relationship with Ken.<br>  <br>  Or, another option.......She could become OctoBarbie.|`|7e632a04dd178e071e54add9fb9eb945aa	First, she is going to have to sell the corvette. Barbie will be happy in a smaller home, perhaps renting for a while until she gets back on her little plastic feet.<br>  <br>  I don't know how her 401 k is, I know she's about 50. She should get part time work at an accessory store to help supplement her income.  <br>  <br>  If Ken can't (or won't) provide - maybe G.I. Joe is still single. <br>  <br>  I really wish you didn't make the "nothing naughty" rule, but I guess it made it more challenging! <br>  <br>  As always, great question.|`|Swo8Xk1Baa	Well like you said, shes not gonna get much help from ken. Shell probably end up stealing shopping carts and dressing like a old fag, then goign to clubs and getting drunk all night so she wont remember that she was poor the next day. and then repeat. <br>  <br>  Dont be surprised if she ends up making a baby, the little girls have to find out one day, <br>  \<br>  lol...|`|s6miUiKSaa	Considerings shes bleach blonde, has a sketchy job history and no education, there isn't any non-naughty option for her besides  becoming a waitress. She also needs a job that can support her current lifestyle. <br>  There's good and fast money in stripping, pornography and  at the Mustang Ranch.|`|4FHHuD0daa	she best go get me my damn money, that's what.

I was sure I saw Biker Barbie and her B**ch Midge at Toys-R-Us. Right next to Cowboy Ken - complete with Brokeback Accessories.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I am sure Midge will let her move in.

It's Rihanna's choice. I mean it's not like we can force her not to go back to him against her free will. I know everyone has different opinions about it. But nobody knows the story between Rihanna and Chris Brown one hundred percent. Not even the media or press. Only Rihanna and Chris knows what's really going on between them and she probably has her reasons why she wants to get back with Rihanna. She probably knows a lot of people are going to say what are you doing and things like that and she appreciates the care and support from her fans. But her relationship and her personal life is personal. It's such a shame people are so nosy and everything and they get mad at or upset at Rihanna. But what can she do? She's just a girl who happens to be a talented singer and millions of people around the world want to know everything about her. I don't pay attention to it because it's not my business. I love her as a singer but her choices will affect her not me. And I know she has her reasons. And I have my own life to live. I am a caring person but I don't like to look into other people's problems. I don't even know her personally. If I did I would then have a say about it.|`|QJRM2IEEaa	Well I think both of them should be ashamed of themselves...Rihanna has lost all of my respect by taking him back. She's a role model for women...if she likes getting beat...then so be it.<br>  As for him...he broke the law...I'm so tried of celebs getting off scott free when they break the law.
bIouq64Oaa	Yeah =D But I can't tell you, it'll spoil the surprise... :-D|`|CDkUMzzCaa	Oh! Good idea! <br>  I just learned about the "scary maze game" on a youtube vid. So I looked it up. It's a maze that u prank someone into playing...basically they're consentrating on gettingt through it without touching the walls. The catch is that when they rreach the "end" a face from The Exorcists pops up screaming. There's a lot of youtube vids up showing ppl getting pranked and thus freaked by their friends. lol *evil wisper* I'm gonna make one myself.|`|QCkYxsSfaa	oh yeah baby! don't even get me started!|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Not yet, I'll probably forget like I did last year.|`|MxPkyTLnaa	nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

All in all, i say just go with the flow, follow the trend and give up|`|LlC99CYqaa	he is an actor that is in walker texas ranger . people think he is cool & stuff i guess , just someone to make fun of (: hah .

a67e16a697e36894e15668da828b7458aa	As I'm sure you know, J.K. Rowling really likes to use names that are eaither real words, or sound like real words. For example, the word "Dumbledore" actually means "Bumblebee" in old English. She has said in an interview that she named him that because she can imagine him happily flitting about like a bumblebee. "Dobby" is a real word in the English language. If you follow this link, it will take you to the meaning AND give you a sound clip so that you can clearly hear that it is, in fact, pronounced "dawby"!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dobby?qsrc=2888" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/d...</a>|`|21Lnhdfeaa	The same as you would pronounce Bobby<br>  <br>  dawby|`|frA6KJwIaa	it is 'dawby' trust me.|`|uxTlf5qbaa	Well if you were in English class and you saw the word "Dobby"  What how would you sound it out.

fJt5zRTXaa	KaNa<br>  <br>  Yuuji Abe meets a mysterious girl at the subway station. This chance encounter with Kana and Rou, her wolf companion entangles Yuuji in a plot concocted by the Seven Heads, a group of half-demons who want to bring a type of utopia where humans and demons can live together peacefully, albeit through unscrupulous and forceful means. As the group targets Kana and her companions, Yuujo begins to discover the truth not only about Kana, but about his own ancestors, and ultimately comes to terms with his budding feelings for this mysterious girl.<br>  <br>  Omamori Himari <br>  <br>  After losing his last relatives Amakawa Yuuto lives with his childhood friend Rinko, his only problem being his allergy to cats. Until on his 16th birthday a girl with a sword appears, telling him that he is the descendant of a family of demon slayers and that she is a spirit sworn to protect him. Bad luck for Yuuto, since she is a cat spirit and eager to get close to him... very close...<br>  <br>  Onni - chan to Ishho<br>  <br>  Sakura had lived with her grandma ever since her parents died in a car accident when she was three. When she turned fourteen, her grandma also passed away, leaving her alone. Just when she was about to give up hope having a family, out of nowhere, four guys claim to be her older half-brothers.<br>  <br>  Konkou Debut<br>  <br>  Haruna Nagashima gave her all to softball in middle school, and now that she's made her high school debut she's decided to give her all for a new goal. Getting a boyfriend and falling in love! However, she has one small problem. Since she never paid any attention to fashion or trend in middle school she has no idea how to go about attracting her yet-to-be-found love. But a chance encounter with with Yoh Komiyama provides her with the opportunity she needs. If he coaches her in how to become attractive, surely she can find herself a boyfriend!<br>  <br>  Kodomo no Omocha <br>  <br>  Sana Kurata, a child actress, faces many problems in her classroom, including a major one - her bullying classmate, Akito Hayama. Sana's outgoing and friendly nature leads her to work towards correcting all of the problems around her. Her 'meddling' irritates Hayama but at the same time captivates him, just as Hayama's gloomy nature irritates Sana and compels her to change him. As these two opposites attract each other, they face many hardships which bring them closer to a mutual understanding.|`|QUpzCltZaa	One Piece :<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1002.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1002.html</a> <br>  <br>  Hunter X Hunter:<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1306.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1306.html</a><br>  <br>  Ranma 1/2:<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/4887.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/4887.html</a>|`|lvlsgRDGaa	If you like Rosario + Vampire, you might like:<br>  Nora: the last chronical of devildom<br>  <br>  Also Try:<br>  Skip Beat!<br>  Otomen<br>  Heaven's Will(only one volume long though)<br>  Kamichu!<br>  Scrapped Princess|`|XQMm3Ahraa	it's not the longest list I've seen i'll tell you that much<br>  <br>  black cat<br>  bobobobo bobobo<br>  melancholy of haruhi suzumiya<br>  school rumble<br>  inuyasha<br>  gundam seed<br>  get backers<br>  <br>  those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head<br>  <br>  srry|`|sybbEjSNaa	Fushigi Yuugi<br>  <br>  Fruits Basket<br>  <br>  Mythical Detectove Loki<br>  <br>  Negima<br>  <br>  MeruPuri<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of but I think you would like those ^^|`|cfj0RJLTaa	Uhm..

There are a few sex scenes, but it's not really a racy movie.  It is an interesting film with plenty of violence, though.<br>  <br>  It's not really exciting start to finish like the Dark Knight.  Lots of characters examining their reasons for doing what they do, whether it matters, societal problems etc.<br>  <br>  For violent excitement, just watch Death Race :)|`|zovrJ0yXaa	it is massively violent and racy and sexual. but in a disturbing way. the sex is not sexy and there is sexual violence. the violence itself is just gory and pointless. the film is ok but not as special as the novel it was based on

One time I was very moody and my mom and i were arguing and idk WHAT made me do this, i guess i was REALLY sensitive that day (im an overly sensitive person lol) and i locked myself in the bathroom for about an hour and cried my freakin' eyes out . . . like i said, it was very drastic for me.

I personally think it's ugly to judge and hate on people.<br>  But honestly, I don't think she acts well, and sings well either, and her songs are freaking trash songs to me.|`|ISMColXfaa	I don't think she's as bad as people say she is.

I don't think shes all that great of a person either. I'm not just trying to be cool. I liked one song by her, but I don't like her. I don't think she can act that well either, and I know a lot of people like her and that she is really big, but her dad writes most of her songs, and she doesn't have an amazing voice. But, I don't go around telling people who like her that she's bad, but I'm honestly telling you, I don't like her.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	Wow I could NOT read all that.<br>  But I don't hate on her.

All he wants is sex. If it's not Phyllis, he's at Sharon's hotel room trying to boink her; when she says no, he boinks Phyllis. It's almost kind of said because Phyllis seems to genuinely love Nick.

I am getting so sick of their scenes and storyline. That's all they have anyway, I don't think they ever had real love. Especially now when Nick can't make up his mind. Phyllis deserves that so much but it's kinda annoying because he is acting so dumb and childish that it's just lame. I bet him and Sharon will get back together but I just don't care anymore because they're both acting like immature idiots.I have no idea where the kid is but I feel sorry for her.|`|C46DNX11aa	I like them as a couple but they need to tone down the sex and put more real love and romance into the relationship.

sCu44Beraa	Rorschach refused to follow Ozymindias new way of life and threatend to expose him. Dr. Manhattan had no choice but ot vaporize hime. He believed Ozymindias new way of life was for the best.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	the theme of the movie is that the world is on the brink of nuclear holocaust, and so the only way to unite the world is to find a common enemy. to show he is serious, the smartest man in the world executes a secret plan to blow up key cities in the world. this plot is discovered by the heroes, but when they see that the plan has worked, they, including dr manhattan, decide to keep the plan a secret so that the newfound peace is maintained. only rorschach, who all along, for all his nihilism and violence, has been the most uncompromising one, and refuses to keep the secret. dr manhattan knows that exposing the secret would destroy the newfound peace, so he kills rorschach. the ending is left ambiguous tho, because it is shown that his journal is in the hands of a newspaper, so maybe the secret is revealed even after his death|`|0b701a01033c96d1933cab42e0a5b0c5aa	Because in the future Rorschack would be back in New York spreading the word about Ozy's plot, which would ruin the end of the war-staredown. At the same time, Manhattan would be his way towards the edge of the galaxy. Moments before Rorscack's departure from the A. Arctic, Dr. M would be breaking into Ozy's snow palace to try and stop Ozy, which was 2.8 minutes before Dr. M finds out that Ozy did the right thing.|`|i6Th0lItaa	Because he was going to expose the plot if they let him go.

hexzaIGgaa	There are several pricing guides out there. Just google for them.|`|QUpzCltZaa	<a href="http://www.ttcomic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com</a>|`|8c9a1b0ff7a0aa23aaae2438f305eb3eaa	The most important tool for many years (since the 1970's) is the Oversteet Comic Book Price Guide.  Steven Geppi, the sole distributor of comics (from the publisher to real comic dealers) is the Publisher also of OVERSTREET.  It is important for many reasons mostly the grading guide and for Silver Age and Golden Age and Bronze Comics But also for (now) Undergrounds, Big Little Books and more).  It comes out yearly around April and is importnat.  People who contribute to it are other dealers many with and without stores (so not all knowledge will be 100% accurate) still I use it as a GUIDE and it is pretty much OK.  And it has very useful information.  WIZARD is good too but doesn't cover all comics as Overstreet tries to.  Trends of what is selling for a lot --new/modern/copper-Bronze and some Silver Age or hot comics can be seen.  It comes out Monthly.  This is important since comics are like a good stock market and prices rise and fall rapidly.  Sort of, kind of.  Stuff is worth what people will give you.  Emotional attachment could be a factor too as we try to reclaim our youth.  Some things are worth more than money.  Comics are often one of them.  Kindof.  (p.s. Selling on auction you can look at closed auctions to see what stuff sold for.)  GRADE MATTERS so does demand.  Sell to a private party for most bucks.  If in a hurry you'll just give them away.  Walk around a local comic con and see what stuff is being offered at too.  You can get real deals there and then resell for higher amounts often.  Put an ad in your local newspaper and I bet you will get calls to buy them.  Get the Guide at your local comic store first.|`|1BdUkF0zaa	Try Ebay.

The second one Basketcase 2 is when they try to sew themselves back together. That creepy head twin Belial is flippin' scary. Watch them both, great films.

I'm squeeling until saturday waiting to see how she saves him.<br>  <br>  I swear Ikuto secretly follows her, he's always there for her in the nick of time!!<br>  <br>  I don't think she should end up with tadase as he's really only fell in love with her ran character,not amu in general. I'm hoping whatsherface with the long purple hair comes back and drags him away or something, he does my head in.<br>  <br>  If I could marry him,I so would.<br>  <br>  I went as amu for my anime night at a local nightclub and my bf went as Akira, he would have gone as Ikuto if he was really thin, gay looking and had blue hair lol... but he looks mighty close, yum!|`|3337cc33a3e69c4d2e55dd53705aa778aa	Well the answer seems like YES obviosly, but im not sure if Peach-Pit-mangaka will let it go so smoothly. Ikuto just likes to be with kids and i dont think he's so serious about t w/ Amu. so i think yea she might end up with Tadase. MIGHT. this manga is so confusing especially in love. Amu is shown to like so many people even though the main 2 are Tadase and ikuto|`|SoGKkcGdaa	YES!<br>  They must end up together!<br>  Plus, in the next episode he is going back to Amu's house!<br>  Amuto!|`|cidwIuJRaa	1. We don't actually know why he has the key,but none of us ever said he stole it.<br>  <br>  2. I don't recall any henshin of them together,and I have seen all the subbed eps. so far.<br>    And,BTW,she did henshin alongside Tadase several times in the anime,so get your facts straight.<br>  <br>  3. No,he is NOT alwayz saving her.Lately,she's having to save his sorry @$$ which really sucks.<br>    But,Tadase has ALWAYS been there for Amu!<br>  <br>  4. Those parts of the anime were just stupid fanservice,and I hated that BS happening b/c I knew dumb Amuto fans would use it against us smart Tadamu fans in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I truly believe that Amu will end up with Tadase,b/c they both love one another.And,Tadase has even confessed to her twice.... once about Amulet Heart and once to Amu.|`|HeAEMpCTaa	I don't think they do.<br>  <br>  I read part of the last chapter of Shugo chara the other day, and from the looks of it, 'Amuto' is just not going to happen.<br>  <br>  ...But I wish they did.

Not even if the money went to my personal bank account.  i die before I could use it.|`|MsW1DikZaa	never... cant, im not a charity person cuz i need the charity!|`|TYIsV3CTaa	definitely. it would be for a great cause!|`|tehdmkjkaa	yes i would|`|68Dq930Daa	thats wonderful...what if i fell & splatted like a bug? would they still get the money|`|hNa5oHxQaa	No<br>  I couldn't do it.|`|pj02ePxAaa	i wouldn't climb any mountain to save my life. i am so afraid of heights. but i wouldn't mind donating  some money. :) ?|`|5f6c8f16d3b0eff919c4db41f4c72b72aa	I would if they paid for me to get there and for my equipment.  So...I'm donating to charity by not even going because it would be too expensive for me to get there from where I am now!  <br>  <br>  JK.<br>  <br>  Yes, I would.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Depends on how much money.  Probably for the right sum.|`|c6P3LmGiaa	depends on how much|`|p1TzNiSDaa	yepp.
zBkaqIWcaa	In the car scene the actors are just partially nude, or at least have a "barrier" on so their genitals don't touch.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	not sure about the car scene but i do know that in the drawing scene, it was not Leo's hand doing the drawing but that of James Cameron the director. Leo also flubbed his line when he says "get on the bed, couch" they thought it fit well with the scene so they kept it. you can go to imdb.com and look at the trivia for the movie and see if it helps any as well.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	I think I can help with the last question... Kate Winslett has a blanket covering her, so she is either topless under the blanket or wearing a strapless bra/shirt, but who knows? And then Leo does not have a shirt on. Otherwise, you don't see anything else, so I'm sure they have stuff on the bottom.<br>  <br>  Here's some articles with Kate talking about the nude stuff:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.accesshollywood.com/kate-winslet-on-film-nudity-i-wont-do-it-again_article_14605" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesshollywood.com/kate-wins...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.actressarchives.com/news.php?id=13611" rel="nofollow">http://www.actressarchives.com/news.php?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/celebrity/kate-winslet-mar07" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/c...</a>
p5ZJfiIaaa	Of course. Whenever I used to think about it, I would get about ten seconds of this really empty feeling in my stomach- kind of panciky, stressful, weird-- but it doesn't really happen anymore. I would just think "oh man, there is nothingness, absolutely nothing, woah..."  I think that happened because I don't really believe it anything, so I really just have no idea. <br>  Only one way to find out I guess.|`|vycAqfkiaa	After death your soul will emerge from your body. Every thought wish or desire will instantly appear. You can move on to become still in complete nirvana with the oneness (God), or you can inhabit another being, or body. But you can choose to do whatever you want. Your soul lives forever and forever, and there is no hell. God wouldn't ever do something like that to us.|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	yea i sure hope its better than my last life(on earth)<br>  i think it will be boring tho in heaven cause flying with wings and a halo will get old <br>  I hope hell is more jumping like never be still and fight fight fight bout like this life only no fire or pitchfork in my ****|`|62D577feaa	Yeah I think about this all the time I think that once you die and go to heaven that you get whatever you want don't feel pain or worrys and can meet god and Jesus and the other close people to you that have passed|`|jNHg4FFLaa	he he. my name austin to... oh! anyway. i have thought about it long and hard. just think about it. forever and ever in heaven. ever! no stop! my brain cant even process it!|`|AjFC8mEFaa	sometimes i wonder. i think my opinion is that after i die, i will probably come back as someone else.|`|GUqL7Wtaaa	i totally panic when i think of that stuff cuz i dont really believe in an after life i guess.<br>  its scarryyyy to think about D:|`|YDubSVbYaa	I do.<br>  I dont really believe in heaven or hell. But if its true, I wanna go to heaven.|`|f4064e34078d880efada331604411b92aa	Believe me the older you get the less you want to find out!|`|Ca0BDWTRaa	Ya!<br>  I think about it all the time!|`|faa7902e1ee0c17b5068f8bb39d73dc6aa	i beleive the day of judgement<br>  <br>  paradise and hell|`|mNZCMuSpaa	Yeah, I've thought about it.<br>  I believe in heaven-- I cannot wait.<br>  That's my home; that's why I'm living this life..so I can get there.<br>  <br>  I think about it, but never worry. :)|`|EzrdyxAiaa	nope == never give it a thought!!!|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Oh gosh yah. I wonder why it will feel like. It's very a scary to me because it's like this is all I know. I don't know anythig else besides life as it is now. I am speehless. I'm catholic and believe in all I hat but still wonder what will it all be like. I mean what will reality be like and where is the end? Oh gosh you got me scared!!! Hhhmmm. Where's home then? Heaven? Wow, I could talk hours about my confusion but I won't waste your one but I have a feeling ur honking the same as me right now.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	yes, but I know that if I continue to have the personality and heart I do now all of us can make it through purgitory and live a beautiful, stress free, after life|`|OIcn7keJaa	I believe in incomprehensible nothingness.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	I wonder ALL THE TIME.<br>  <br>  I try to have faith that I'll see my family and everyone who's passed before me... but I still get worried that there won't be anything.|`|547Ln6rNaa	The idea of meeting everyone you loved and lost bothers me. What if you loved your husband but he died young....and later you married again. When you get there, will you have two husbands waiting? how will that work.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of all my dogs being there, but will they be jealous of each other?<br>  <br>  I am assuming that if we all go somewhere, we'll have little memory of anything or it wont work out very well. Maybe it'll be like drugs, we'll all just be happy all the time and never question anything. I wish we could stay as we are but all be young and healthy again, and have all the dogs.|`|t65Rb2YNaa	yesss;;; i think its scary and kinda werid how once the world is gna end and there will be no one on earth. tht creeps me out. but i also belive in heaven. in my religion there is a thing called the day of judgementt and in tht day yu are ethier assigned heavean or hell and yu stay there for the rest of yaa..|`|4FHHuD0daa	^<br>  ^ that person is right<br>  <br>  Anyway,  I wonder what it's like to have a penis.  I mean how much fun it would be.  I would use it to its fullest capacity.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	i dont entirely believe in reincarnation, but sometimes i think it would be kinda fun.<br>  i enjoy watching shows about people who believe in it.|`|yudfOAQQaa	Yes I always wondered about that. I'm curious if there's another life after that or if there's a heaven or hell.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	Yeah, I used to. But my faith has kind of gotten stronger. So not much now, but i used to a lot.|`|3kRnw3eNaa	I believe there is a Hell; that's it.|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	i wander all the time but don't really know.|`|C45FOXZJaa	I wondered that today actually, my neighbor died from a heart attack. He worked with my dad and was extremely kind to me and my family. I wish I could say that he went to a better place, but I can't make myself believe that. I suppose he went or is whatever or wherever he was before he was fetus. As far as I know, he didn't exist before he then so maybe we just stop existing after death.|`|AA10175631	Yeah, everyone thinks about their mortality. It's what makes us human. As for heaven and hell, I think that's all a fairy tale. Something to ease the fear and uncertainty that goes along with knowing the we and those that we love are going to die. It's a bummer, but we have to make the best of it and try to enjoy the small time we're given.|`|ixmaM395aa	I honestly don't believe I'm going to die and float off to my Oasis but the thought is definitely nice and makes death seem somewhat nicer. <br>  <br>  But I do believe in spirits and if we don't cross over then believe some are destined to wander the earth forever.|`|OWKJTU6kaa	Yes! I know exactly how you feel. I am so intrested in death ( and not scared of it either). I mean, we can almost never find out because we don't come back after death! It's so fascinating. Maybe we go to heaven, or stay with the ones we love. Or god asks us at the gates of heaven if we want to proceed or be with our loved ones that are still alive.|`|2jMFurDoaa	sometimes the thought comes to mind after ive done something "bad" and i wonder if that is something God could condemn me for. <br>  <br>  I think when i die ill go to heaven though. i live right. im a good person. i go to church. i do way more good than bad lol.|`|IMHwA20jaa	I do a lot...and sometimes I don't even think Heaven is real. But on others, I can feel so close to it. To me, I think Heaven and Hell depend on being real with our moods and how we're feeling. I'm a reincarnation believer is what I'm saying.|`|3e9107204262e3d3aa86a26a9a823735aa	I think there will be happiness forever, a reunion with loved ones, live rock concerts, marble houses or houses of choice to live in, flowers, music, beautiful skies and rainbows, waterfalls, and ...utopia!|`|mdKX8eJlaa	Heaven =D<br>  <br>  and if not that Reserection|`|rS04obBgaa	ALLAH AHLEM|`|OUo9J4i1aa	A soul will either go somewhere else or seize to exist. We didn't design this life so we have no choice and no real answer.|`|7ADHptSaaa	YES BUT THEN I REMEMBER THAT I'LL GO TO HEAVEN!|`|jyi4OZi1aa	Nothing, you just die and that all.|`|LuXvXQbRaa	Heaven and hell,<br>  <br>  <br>  think : who created this earth?<br>  hmm. we didnt just land on here, lol|`|fyggOrpJaa	I wonder alot, but it'sd more about logic.|`|UI4dpdgnaa	naah|`|R4u4nWaLaa	Yeah I've been wondering about it...<br>  <br>  Oh well.

I think she could do better lol.|`|zJ2GKkwAaa	altho ii "HATE" Sakura...&& kinda dun lyk Sasuke dat much.....they make surprisingly a kute couple|`|lvlsgRDGaa	Not really.|`|Z1YZs8Izaa	I don't think so.

AA10811040	I wouldn't bother - you could use some software to upscale, but you would be better off letting your bluray player or HD TV do the upscaling for you; they generally do a very good job of upscaling, and just does it while you're watching, which will save you some disk space too...<br>  <br>  If you really want to do the conversion on your computer, try FFMpeg or one of its derivatives from the link below.

zJeOOldtaa	i think the books were better<br>  cause the movie didnt really show how bella and edward fell in love<br>  in the movie they made it seem<br>  like<br>  they fell in love like a day after they met each other<br>  <br>  and i didnt like how they didnt show alot of what happened in the book<br>  <br>  <br>  but if i watched the movie an never knew about the book<br>  i probably would have liked the movie|`|JGjpc7Itaa	As is per the norm, the books were deemed to be better.  I was not all that fond of the books, though.  I didn't think they were very well written and were kind of repetitious and boring.  I actually liked the movie better.|`|dDQLlVF3aa	I've read the books 9 or more times (i stop counting i love them too much). I bought opening night tickets for myself and my 2 nieces (we had a little book club for twilight going on). I walked out of the movie half way through it because it really ticked me off. The movie story line was completely different from the books. Like all good books turned into movies the director rushed parts of the book because of the time issue. BUT instead of the insignificant parts being rushed some of the parts that were critical to the plot of the book were changed. AND senses in the movie DID NOT follow the book at all, they were from the directors point of view. And although Stephanie Meyer is a great author she ruined her own movie by 1) have a cameo roll in the movie 2) and allowing her devoted fans to be completely disappointed by a horrible movie.<br>  <br>  I eventually have gone back and watched the entire movie twice now, only because I love the series so much. I am still mortified that a director and movie production company could use devotion from fans as a ploy to make a low budget film and destroy a good book. <br>  <br>  but of course all of this is IMO....|`|ONTzkwSqaa	It ruined the book. What was the director thinking? Even HARRY POTTERs movies were great! I mean before the movie came out, all the twilight readers were a special group of people, now everybody likes it, and obsesses over it the wrong way. I obsess over the book characters (Jasper for the most part) than that peice of junk claled a movie. Kristen Stewart was terrible, and they uglied her up. Robert was too serious. I was so excited and stuff but when I saw it... It skipped parts and made no sense. They shouldve picked a different bella. James, Victoria and Laurnet were just as I pictured. Except for the super main chracters, people were ok... The only thing I dont like about the book, is Jacobs hair is long. He shoulda kept it boy short in all of the books, I used to be on his team but turned over. <br>  HOPEFULLY the new directer of new Moon will clean this crisis up!|`|n5u3rkV4aa	it was rubbish in comparison to the books. But i am out the twilight phase now.....so the books i find are only "ok" now.....maybe if i reread them i would become all hyped up again. =D|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	I read the book after I saw the movie because I didn't even know about Twilight. I think the movie was pretty good, but the books are better.|`|nQwSlue1aa	The movie and the books are crap.|`|0ZQhUATDaa	I totally agree with you.  I was so hyped after reading the books, and I was really let down.  I went to the midnight showing and waited 2 hrs for it to come on with a bunch of screaming girls...and it soo wasn't worth it.  I thought that it was kind of a parody of Twilight like they were making fun of the books.  It wasn't made well at all.  It jumped around and didn't even follow the same sequence as the book.  Plus, why would they add scenes that weren't in the book instead of putting ones that were in the book.|`|4wtLoXiQaa	The way they adapted and made the book into a movie-version was okay, I think, but the overall directing and script was horrible. Some scenes did not even make sense, and they were quite awkward at times. The actors did not do a very good job either, but they were okay.|`|09fdLaeIaa	it was OK

fKcr6KU0aa	If you're just out-of-the-loop, you probably already know about this one and it is obvious, but: The Sandman, by Neil Gaiman.  Really good, and has won some awards, too.

Ow6lKFXiaa	According to their home site, they were unknowns until they were hired to sing the song, so it was apparently written by someone else. I am unable to locate who. <br>  <br>  Your friend's claim is improbable but not impossible.  The pair are from Sweden, is he from Sweden or any place in Europe?  Taking into consideration your friends age, he might have still had a high pitched voice at the time. Can he show you anything, such as receipts from a recording studio or for paying the models?  Papers that have his compositions and notes during his creation of the song? A copy of the demo made at the studio?  <br>  <br>  If he can find something like that, not only would he have grounds to convince you but also proof that the song was stolen from him and he could then take legal action.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.luckytwice.com/bio.asp?menu=bio" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckytwice.com/bio.asp?menu=b...</a>

PeuFnqQwaa	Network....get to know as many people involved in the music indusrty as you can. Do this through awards shows, social events, parties etc. Other than that, it takes luck, lots of luck. The more public performances you do will increase your exposure and hopefully someone discovering you. Another thing you can do is release a CD or a Single independantly. Try and do all you can do to promote it and cause as much as a Buzz as you can. This can sometimes get labels to take notice. Most of all though, you need luck on your side. Being an exceptional performer will also help you. Practice, Practice, Practice... don't forget to pay attention to details as well. You have to stand out from the crowd and do things better...or different.  Good Luck!!|`|b6ba269a43ec6d03500679d084769059aa	The moment I even read your title, I thought Youtube, if it goes viral then some producer has got to be paying attention.  Even if it doesn't help you get produced, you can go independant and Youtube would help you advertise and sell your music.  But you've gotta be good.|`|5lDazU4maa	YouTube has been a great platform for a lot of artists and it's a great way to get your name and music out there. Myspace and Facebook are also good for this reason, however, being proactive and actually performing locally will not only help you become a better performer but will allow you start to be recognized and also build up your resume. Coffee shops with open mic nights and local singing contests are a great way to gain exposure. Good luck!!!

To make yourself feel more worth- surround yourself with winners- the good in them attracts you,|`|WJ5lGNxxaa	Well I'm not a psychic, but I am a Pisces. I know that when things are bad for a Pisces, things are BAD. Just try and keep strong, try to be around positive people, allow yourself time to think about all of the good things you have in life. I'm sure that things will pick up again, life is not all terrible. Wrongs will be righted, in the end. I think that things will soon get better for you, because life isn't life without it's ups and downs. If you're in a down, try to think about when you'll be up again. If your up, cherish the moment.<br>  <br>  There is a certain quote that I like to say to myself when things aren't that great. <br>  <br>  "When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, give life a thousand reasons to smile."<br>  <br>  =D<br>  <br>  Stay hopeful && optomistic.

fAMpwF3Aaa	It will was the last Star Wars movie.<br>  They will not make another.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I guess you don't quite get it. Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, is the next part of the story. There are no movies detailing the events in the years between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, nor will there be. What happened is the Empire replaced the Republic, and Vader became the being we first saw in the original movies. Vader and Palpatine, after all, were the Sith in question. Lucas always claimed he envisioned three trilogies, with the last three parts taking place after Return of the Jedi. But it looks like those three will never happen now.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	It wasn't meant to be an end. It was a beginning.  Get Star Wars A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  Return of the Jedi is the final Star Wars film.|`|W9anwUl2aa	Episode 4 is "A New Hope", which is the original Star Wars movie.

Pvp3FbuBaa	Suburbia (1984) <br>  When household tensions and a sense of worthlessness overcome Evan, he finds escape when he clings with the orphans of a throw-away society. The runaways hold on to each other like a family until a tragedy tears them apart. Directed by Penelope Spheeris of "Decline of Western Civilization<br>  With the exception of 'Chris Pedersen' and Bill Coyne, the kids in the movie were not professional actors.<br>   The Rejected Kids hangout was an area of condemned housing that was going to be demolished to make way for the construction of a freeway to LAX.<br>    The homes where the TR kids live were condemned under eminent domain to make way for the Century (Interstate 105) Freeway, which wasn't finished for almost 15 years. The freeway they eventually built was featured in "Speed" as the freeway under construction where the bus has to jump the unfinished chasm.<br>    Penelope Spheeris cast real punk rockers instead of seasoned actors in the interest of realism.<br>  <br>  Soundtrack----------------------------...<br>  <br>  "Richard Hung Himself"<br>  Written by Casey Royer<br>  Performed by D.I.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Wash Away"<br>  Written by Todd Barnes, Ron Emory, Jack Grisham, Greg Kuehn & Mike Roche<br>  Performed by Tsol (as T.S.O.L.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Darker My Love"<br>  Written by Todd Barnes, Ron Emory, Jack Grisham, Greg Kuehn & Mike Roche<br>  Performed by Tsol (as T.S.O.L.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "The Legend Of Pat Brown"<br>  Written by Joe Escalante<br>  Performed by The Vandals<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "No God"<br>  Written by Darby Crash & Pat Smear<br>  Performed by The Germs<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Urban Struggle"<br>  Performed by The Vandals|`|df05aeac639e6449ab9b85b9769cbe25aa	I agree^^^<br>  Suburbia fits in with the punk genre.

rHrZOSc7aa	In the Goblet of Fire, the Hogwarts is located in England...so the actors having their British accents fit right in. But since Twilight is located in Forks, Washington..he (Edward Cullen) is not really meant to have a British accent.. So he (I guess) avoids letting his accent come out|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	No. Robert Pattinson does not have a British accent in Twilight.|`|0RinjMbJaa	robert pattinson dropped his british accent for twilight and used a slightly different tone in his voice because it is supposed to be alluring, and he didn't think his voice was alluring enough.

CRDl9nffaa	If you want really heavy atmosphere you should try some of the old school stuff like the Bernard Hermann soundtracks for 'Psycho', 'Jason and the Argonauts', 'Mysterious Island' and 'Taxi Driver'. Hermann was some kind of genius in my opinion and kind of invented modern film music.<br>  <br>  Another giant figure is Ennio Morricone, who's had a tremendous output and influence on film music. I'd recommend his scores for 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once upon a time in America' for starters.<br>  <br>  John Barry is also a gifted composer. His best work for me is 'The Lion in Winter' but he's well known for 'Midnight Cowboy' and his excellent Bond soundtracks. The best Bonds by him, for me, are 'Diamonds are Forever', 'From Russia with Love', 'Goldfinger' and 'On her Majesty's Secret Service'.<br>  <br>  Good luck in tracking some of these down, though. It's not going to be as easy to find as the blockbuster John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith stuff!|`|erKyfwSbaa	Anything by John Williams is amazing.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	Lord of the Rings<br>  Harry Potter<br>  Edward Scissorhands<br>  Schindler's List<br>  Pirates of the Caribbean

The ability is rare, and thus highly prized. Teito is an amnesiac and doesn't remember anything of his origins -- what he does learn of his past comes from his recurring and often traumatizing dreams.<br>  After a year at the academy, Teito takes the graduation exam; it is notoriously difficult, with a pass rate of twenty in five hundred. Teito and his best (and only) friend, Mikage, pass easily. That night, in their shared dorm room, they each promise to help the other at any cost. The next day, Teito is delivering papers to a professor when he overhears his name. He stops to listen and realizes that the speaker, a man named Ayanami, is the man who killed his father in his dreams. Teito is found eavesdropping and tries to attack his father's murderer, but is quickly brought down by one of Ayanami's subordinates and sent to prison. Mikage comes to help him escape, only to find that Teito has managed to fight past the guards by himself. The two flee the building, but are cornered on a balcony. Teito pretends to hold Mikage hostage, threatening to kill him; however, he whispers to Mikage, "We'll always be best friends, right?" After Mikage replies "Of course," Teito jumps off the balcony onto a waiting hawkzile (a kind of flying motorcycle) to escape.<br>  Ayanami notices Teito trying to escape and sends a Zaiphon attack after him, which Teito manages to partly deflect. The injury eventually weakens him and he loses control of his hawkzile, sending it crashing into another. Luckily for Teito, the man on the other hawkzile is a Bishop in the nearby 7th District, and brings him to the church to recuperate. Since Teito is still in chains, the Bishop, Frau, mistakes him for a slave and comments that if Teito had been a soldier in the Imperial army, he would have killed him immediately. Because of the law of "sanctuary", Teito may stay in the church without fear of the Empire or Ayanami.<br>  Teito carries the Eye of Michael, the powerful artifact that his home country, the Raggs Kingdom, was ransacked for. The tragic death of a loved one catapults him into his quest for revenge against the Barsburg Empire and knowledge about his past, while he becomes entangled with the Gods, Verloren, and the 7 Ghosts.<br>  His best friend's fate spurs Teito into trying to master the Bascule -- a powerful weapon that can harness and focus his innate power. Friends become enemies and rivals become allies as Teito begins to fulfill his destiny, and protect his fallen country from the minions of his former masters.      --|`|ryLbKatoaa	Try Loveless.

9iElNpSSaa	From what you are describing, there are two most likely culprits for the problem.  Since the lowest notes are jumping up an octave, you are probably biting into the mouthpiece and reed too much.  Keep your embouchure firm, but try using less pressure from your bottom lip.  The second suggestion is to try a slightly lighter strength of reed.  Playing on too hard a reed can force you to bite too much.  <br>  <br>  There are other possibilities for the problem, too.  Your instrument could be leaking air from one of the pads, making it very difficult to produce low notes.  Show your instrument to your teacher or a good repairman and see if they notice any problems with the saxophone.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure the reed is perfectly centered on the mouthpiece and that it’s not too high or too low.  If none of these things help, you might try another mouthpiece and see if that improves the situation.  The Yamaha 4C and 5C mouthpieces are very good student mouthpieces and will help you produce a consistent tone in all ranges of the saxophone.?<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ythN9BQgaa	I cry EVERY night right before I go to sleep. Not because someone hurt my feelings, or I had a bad day. I just do. I ask myself why I was even born and what if I just killed myself. I feel unloved and like I was a mistake brought into this world.

And i can't or don't show it when i cry unless that person is close to me like my Husband and couple friends.|`|jTkzSyzbaa	im very emotional too. i used to cry alot when i was younger, but lately i held it in well, but sometimes when i watch a sad movie i cant help myself from shedding some tears. or the worst case somebody point out my weaknesses, frustrating things that im hiding inside and that's dead on. :p <br>  <br>  edit. oh whats wrong with all the thumbs down hahaha. maybe its because of the last thing i said, then you dont understand hows it like when you always pretend like everything alright and you're strong until one day somebody really sees through you and pinpoint it out. its a complicated feeling. <br>  <br>  pisces sun, cancer moon, aquarius rising.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	I cry a lot, but I try not to! My sign is Aries :)|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I hardly ever cry. I cried last in November and before then August. Normally, I cry 3-4 times a year or so. <br>  <br>  If someone cries, I don't usually know what to do either in public or private. <br>  <br>  When I cry, it's rarely in public. the last time I cried in public was in 2006 when I was at school. During the few times that I do cry, it's usually when I am alone in my bedroom. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius sun<br>  Leo moon<br>  Aquarius rising|`|1NCPPHR9aa	I cry if my husband gets angry with me. I cry when he comes to me sweetly to apologize for being a jerk to me.<br>  I am usually on top of the world emotionally and am an Aries.<br>  Only the man I love with all of my heart ( my husband) can penetrate my feelings enough to make me cry. <br>  And I cry for joy like when something makes me extremely happy eg. my grandson was born this month and I cried at the sight of him.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I cry frequently..it's a release. However, I do it in private.<br>  <br>  I'm a Cancer.|`|8326e8ed18368243be0734a4088435e3aa	I'm emotional because of my fricken Scorpio moon but not everything makes me cry, more like when I see suffering animals and people or sad movies. I don't hurt very easy unless it's by very, very close friends, relatives, loved ones and even then I'm more pissed and offended.<br>  <br>  Aquarius|`|1PdUecpYaa	i'm pretty emotional and moody. i cry a lot. i don't like bottling things up so i just let it all out, but i don't cry in front of other people. so they often think i'm either happy or just pissed off... <br>  but if i'm upset with someone, i'd tell them exactly what they did that made me upset and yell at them. i'd hold my tears and get angry instead and then i'd lock myself in my room and cry a little...|`|oDdXpghDaa	I don't really tear up a lot unless it's at a sad movie... but I'm an emotional wreck inside, and like a typical Pisces I retreat to the sanctuary of my bedroom when the going gets tough so I can get lost in distraction.<br>  <br>  It's not that Pisces plays hide and seek - it's just, well, being a fish, things are a LOT less turbulant at the bottom of the sea.|`|B7WIZdglaa	I do not cry often at all. I do cry at the animal abuse commercials on tv, I will cry if someone is in pain or going through something terrible. I cry if i'm very frustrated or fed up sometimes. But it's definetly not somehting that happens alot. <br>  <br>  <br>  -Aquarius|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	never cry infront of others, only once or twice in my life. but i've cried alot by myself usually because of a broken heart .its hard for me to get over someone.<br>  Taurus venus and mars in Pisces|`|9JEyfhfPaa	I'm not very emotional and I can't cry for no reason. I cry only when I get nervous or feel frustrated. I never cry 4 others.|`|AA11452399	I can be very emotional (Taurus)|`|AA10372530	I am generally very emotional in the sense that I filter everything around me emotionally. But I rarely cry. In fact I rarely express myself emotionally in ways that other find obvious, but I do it in more subtle ways. It's kind of difficult to read me in that sense because although my moods are very strong and intense, I can superficially get over them when the situation requires it and wear an appropiate social mask.<br>  <br>  Scorpio Sun<br>  Sag Rising<br>  Libra Moon|`|ZtnXNbaEaa	hey im exactly the way you are... i dont know its weird but i feel better crying infornt of starngers than before the people i care for... i never let a tear roll infront of my frineds nor my Bf they dont even know that i cry... ofcourse i get mushy gushy and affectionate stuff... but then i cry for every emotional scene in a movie... i cried so many times in my fav movie called "pursuit of happiness" and if i see something realistic and practical which is little pathetic i start crying... its coz i've lotta water in me like my moon in pisces and sun in cancer and these two makes me emotioanlly weak|`|d2uGruHiaa	I rarely cry because I tend to hold it in. But sometimes, I get tired of holding it in because it's only hurting me even more, so I just let it all out on my own time and no one else's. And then the next day, I'll act like nothing happened because I wouldn't want anyone knowing that I was crying. People have it harder than me, and that's my motivation to make me not cry for silly things in life. But when I do cry- I tend to just let it all out. Maybe it's because i'm a Capricorn with a Cancer rising.|`|AA12110368	I'm a very emotional person and feel like crying but most of the time I don't do it in front of anyone, i'll go lock myself somewhere and cry or I won't cry and i'll feel like my heart hurts :(  like right now i'm in between having my heart crushed and anger.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	I feel others pain so I cry for them but they never understand why, When I cry I normally cry so hard when I'm alone, if I'm in public I hold back my tears unless it's unbearable.

UYaWH7a0aa	While George Strait still produces new tunes I feel like he follows a very 'classic' country style in general and isn't as new wave as other country artists. <br>  <br>  In other classic country I like the twang in the voice and some great instruments.

0QOy1ALUaa	I have to agree, any song on the bulletproof cd is absolutely phenomonal. My favorite songs ok that album however, is "a guy like me" ad "never had a chance", as well as "one false move."

(hope is where we get the women away from the abuser and find them a job and shelter for their children and themselves and do the legal work. divas is where we relocate them. if they are in va, we find a job for them in mas or so and find someone to stay with till they get on their feet, and you would be surprised how many people are willing to help its' amazing)|`|AA10953999	I didnt look at the site yet but I agree that it takes one person to change one person.... etc.|`|TLrRt8kOaa	It takes a lot more than one person to change the world but the website that you gave is incredible.

8NFLpbJAaa	Secret Diary of a wall flower,<br>  I think thats the name :]<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|3a38kxkhaa	I'm into the OLD CLASSIC NOVELS like F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," which is a great book for someone who wants to read something from American Literature that has some insight and value to it...Ernest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms" is another exciting read...Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" may be one of the best books ever written, I highly recommend it to any and all bookworms out there.  Also almost any of Hunter S. Thompson's works are simply fascinating, if you can stand the insanity that comes along with his style of writing.  While they are highly commercialized, I can find myself reading Stephen King classics like "Cujo", "Carrie", and "It" over and over again.  A great book that I actually just finished was "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" by Ken Kesey...not exactly your traditional literary classic, but a very interesting and powerful read.  That and Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" have actually influenced and changed my way of thinking about my life.  In many ways, those books inspired me to expand and explore reality to its fullest potential.|`|JDZku5iSaa	YES!! I am near the end of the book Mysterious Skin by Scott Heim. It is really good.

tuULGJS6aa	I like to see the swimsuits, because I may buy some of them, and I'm curious about who models them, so the magazine is worth buying for me. I'm disappointed this time though, because my favorite Marissa Miller isn't shown in new swimsuits.|`|Aw2oxQnuaa	I buy it every year. It only comes out once a year. I just like looking at the models.

9vXRjfuqaa	Slash is more popular, he could arguably be in the list of top ten best guitarist's of all time. Axel isn't an amazing front man, he wouldn't be able to make the list of the top 20 best front men of all time...|`|NUcmCNGraa	probably Slash|`|LzzTpVEUaa	Definitely Slash.|`|NkFxlEPqaa	Tough one....popular in what respect? <br>  <br>  Slash is more respected in my books because he has managed to stay in the music business without creating much negative feedback. He still is an active part of a 2nd successful rock act, that being Velvet Revolver. Axl has promised, then delayed, then promised again before delivering an album that was promoted and hyped without making a real big statement on the music scene. Check the statistics and you can be rest assured a Velvet Revolver has outgunned Chinese Democracy. Is Axl exciting? He can be when he gets his act together. What about Slash? He is - because he's a performer who's out there onstage showing everyone his talent. Axl's talents are always sidelined due to the way he is  - either overly dramatic behind the scenes or detail - obsessed. Either way you look at it, I would definitely pick Slash as more popular - he brings the goods!

They yell to the brunette to jump but she says,"No I saw what you did to the redhead"! They shout we don't like redheads! So the brunette jumps and sure enough they move the blanket and she dies. Then they shout to the blonde to jump off into the blanket. But the blonde says,"no I saw what you did to them"! They shout we don't like them! The blonde then says, "I don't trust you guys, put the blanket on the ground and step back!"|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	do you think Bubbles can make ice cubes|`|oWpZ8Ik9aa	this is no funnier than the last one!<br>  <br>  try this!  :<br>  A blonde stormed up to the front desk of the library and said, "I have a complaint!" <br>  <br>  "Yes, Ma'am?" said the librarian looking up at her. <br>  <br>  "I borrowed a book last week and it was horrible!" <br>  <br>  Puzzled by her complain the librarian asked "What was wrong with it?" <br>  <br>  "It had way too many characters and there was no plot whatsoever!" said the blonde. <br>  <br>  The librarian nodded and said, "Ahhh.

7236f687b83dcda9044d202c7334f1b2aa	Nah, I think she's alright. She used to be class, I thought, simply because she was different from other silly single female artists.
